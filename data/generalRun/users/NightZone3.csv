Trufemcels,fdq1nub,t3_elyaus,1578650447.0,"I think it varies according to the nature of the person observing me.  A lot will either ignore or act in a dismissive manner while others will actively harass.

I noticed that when I was heavier I was harassed less than when I started to lose weight, which I found contradictory as I'd say being heavier is being less attractive by societal standards so I'd have expected more harassment the heavier I got.  I think in some ways people like overweight people as it's like they've automatically 'won' the game with them if they themselves are slimmer.

It makes sense from the point of view that the slimmer you are the more you're seen as entering into competition with other women/the game so more of a threat/more viable for assessment

I also wouldn't assume automatic ugliness if people stare a lot.  It can just mean you have a different/non standard look.  Conformity is what society wants so anyone whose looks are too different from the average will tend to get judged more harshly.  I know for a fact I'm better looking than some of the women who judge me but from within my own niche, hence they try and pull rank on me.  I think to myself ""Let's get on a dating site and see who gets the most hits then"".

Conformity of looks tends to get more respect than attractive non-conformity so in this way a very plain looking person who looks plain is a standard way ie you've seen plenty of other people who look like them, will be treated better than a more attractive person who is attractive in a different/non standard way ie you haven't seen another person who looks like them/they have a more unique look"

PurplePillDebate,fdli12y,t1_fdlhprp,1578524459.0,Yes I knew it would be discussed.  I think there are grey areas but it can seem like/can be implied by others to be some kind of heresy to your own gender to discuss them so easier not to bother.
PurplePillDebate,fdlh9t2,t3_elvvhx,1578523990.0,"Sometimes taken advantage of can mean the man took advantage of the woman's vulnerable state ie she says she's fed up of men who are just after sex and just wants a friend to spend time with platonically.  The man says he's ok with this and gives no sign that he's after sex and is fine with just companionship. But he's lying, he just wants to get the woman on her own then he tries it on and makes it all about sex again as he's accurately assessed the woman as weak willed

I'd say this is taking advantage of a person being too trusting and doing it in a sneaky way.  He's assured of his sexual appeal and that the woman probably has problems advocating for her own best interests ie she should tell him to stop when he makes a move but doesn't as he's more confident and assertive

He knows he can overcome her defences pretty easily in other words but she'd never have given him that opportunity in the first place if he'd made his agenda clear from the start.  She only met him because he acted in a non-sexual friendly manner and both did not even want any kind of relationship.

He played along with the woman in order to fool her then after the deed she was hooked in and got overly attached and felt very resentful about it all when he dropped her as she had initially been trying to escape this whole dynamic in the first place by keeping things platonic.  I see this as taking advantage.  It's the man playing the woman for what he can get out of her and strictly on his terms as well as he was unhappy with the woman seeing another man at some point too. The man isn't taking things seriously/it's casual by default as wasn't even looked for initially but the woman must see him as the only one.  This is gross hypocrisy to me.  It's all messed up in other words with hurt feelings and pride on both sides which would have been avoided if he'd stuck with the initial platonic company aim!"

I can't discuss this topic unemotionally/neutrally, because I have personal experience of it and because it seems a crass thing to do to talk in a flippant manner about what is usually such a traumatising event for people.

I think this topic is generally locked down and not up for debate due to societal attitudes, which are there to rightly protect people.  It makes me feel very uneasy even considering debating it tbh"

PurplePillDebate,fdlblzk,t1_fdlac9x,1578520555.0,"I've spent time on an incel forum as well and tried to challenge some of their ideology but as a woman you're automatically 'the enemy' for many

A lot seem obsessed with the gym and seem to prefer the company of other men.  It's not obligatory to like women or have relationships with them if a man doesn't want to.  What I mean is some men prefer just being around other men; they aren't gay, just prefer male company.  Perhaps in this day and age society is repressing this type of man more; forcing them to have a relationship with someone when they don't want one full stop.  This type of man would have been a monk in the past when people were religious.

I'm not going to agree re rape - it's a horrendous act with no excuses to be made.

PurplePillDebate,fdl7af7,t1_fdl6jkl,1578518253.0,I don't have to persuade men that I'm a good bet - they decide for themselves.  If they decide they like someone better they can go and I'll look for a new partner.  I'd never compete with other women for a man.  If he didn't want only me full stop I'd have no interest in a relationship.

I suppose it all depends on what you seek - just a partner or 'the best partner ever'. I've never had any pre-conceived notion of the type of partner I'm due so I've just seen who likes me first and whether I like them back

There's ambitious people of both genders who think they're due the moon on a stick - I can't relate to this mentality at all"

PurplePillDebate,fdkjqtf,t1_fdkgbxq,1578505119.0,"I've got Aspergers so I was clearly seen as weird and socially awkward and also too quiet (for them) I'd say.  I didn't make any effort to fit in with them either ie I'd be given opportunity to hang out by some of the more accepting ones but often not want to take it as preferred being on my own.

Having to spend most of my time with men if I wanted friends/company I related to sufficiently gave me more of an insight into what they're like as people probably.  I'm totally inept around other women but generally more confident and at ease talking to a man (on the same wavelength of course)

I'd agree that to some extent I had to pay for company with sex, though some partners weren't making it a deal breaker and I certainly didn't feel permanently tied to any one man.  It frustrated the hell out of me that having one male partner who was also my main or only friend I was then expected to just give them up when I found another partner.  The friendship aspect was always far more important to me than the partner side and the fact that the average man wont want to remain friends after a relationship has ended is upsetting as it makes you feel devalued as a person.

So I have internalised anger towards both genders on the back of all this to some extent."

I think that being prone to 'magical thinking' helps me get more out of religion ie I'll see random stuff that happens as being done by God or the Devil lol.  A purely rational thinker wouldn't have this stuff going on.

PurplePillDebate,fdki0fh,t1_fdkhkdg,1578504258.0,"True - there's those who take to it because it's 'the thing to do'/their peers are doing it and those who do it to escape the world.  They probably get fed up of all the interlopers.  I can't game - very impatient and complete lack of orientation and multi-tasking skills - I have difficulty even turning a character round lol

I think some men like having their partner play with or alongside them while others just want it to be their special hobby that they do separately.  I can watch my partner play but have little to no interest in it really.

On another forum on here women said that male gamers were nasty to them if they didn't' find them attractive.  That's sad."

I have problems maintaining a stable mood hence can go from attacking mode to calmer more reasonable one in a short time - it's caused by lack of executive control

Why does everything have to fit into a pill category that's clearly been thought up by someone else though?

I prefer to see things how I see them as an individual

You can't expect people to conform to strict categories in terms of their behaviour as they've all had varying experiences in life hence often won't conform to the theories

Like 'bad boys' can be very likeable despite being selfish dicks and good ones can be boring ie even with the knowledge of how bad a bet for a relationship a person is you'd go with them anyway due to the biological imperative/the genes controlling your choices so how much choice do you ever really have anyway?

Also if most people these days reject religion why are they chasing monogamy as some kind of ideal, which is more or less what the church brought in/enforced - this doesn't make sense"
