bulletjournal,fcg5vee,t1_fcg3a53,1577636774.0,"I’ll definitely start posting more! And thank you for the compliments! 
The teal and yellow are my January colors because I think they complement each other quite nicely. As for a cohesive theme, I’m trying to keep mine simple and geometric, plus a few doodles here and there. 
The reason I’m starting a bujo is because I normally AM all over the place, lol. I sort of planned my colors and spreads ahead, which you could try if it helps."

trump,fceyfq1,t1_fcew7jo,1577624908.0,"‘Classic libtard’ I tend to lean centrist, but whatever. My investments and stocks have gone down for the past few days, but they’ll pick up soon, I’m sure. ‘Twas a mistake to invest right before Christmas and not pull anything out. Anyways, who did your lord and savior Trump inherit the rising economy from? I’ll let you ponder that for a while."

Why should he apologize?"
trump,fcerpgp,t1_fcboebd,1577623155.0,What the fuck. Are you somehow stating that the fAkE NeWs mEdIa writing articles on Trump is akin to bearing the weight of the sins of the world while being nailed to a cross by your wrists and trying not to die of suffocation?
trump,fcer4ld,t1_fcai6t2,1577623022.0,"I’m Christian, and I’m dying of embarrassment right now."

trump,fceoxcg,t1_fceo6fg,1577622476.0,"On behalf of all sane Americans (and Christians, I should note) I wholeheartedly apologize for what these people say and think. They’re the minority, yet are sometimes the loudest. It’s not a shithole here, but I’m sorry if they make you think that it is."

bulletjournal,fc5zfj1,t1_fc5xbgd,1577469005.0,"Yes! I was inspired by Pinterest and the Art Deco theme that’s been going around the subreddit, with lines and stuff. Unfortunately I don’t have a gold pen, so I just did it in white."
