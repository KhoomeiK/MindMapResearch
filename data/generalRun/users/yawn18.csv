AskReddit,ffgs72t,t1_fffn53s,1579913706.0,"This needs to be top comment. As a male suffering severe depression, this is my biggest issue. I work alot and am kinda a homebody but all my friends bailed on me when I wasnt the ""partier"" and instead focused on other things. Now I have literally no friends, and just sit around in my spare time playing games but no friends to play with or even just talk to. Noone that really shares my interests."
leagueoflegends,ffc896t,t3_esqu41,1579793804.0,"you did great but the supp was fantastic. 2 morg Q's, stunned everyone but the quinn, pretty sure blocked a skill shot hitting you with his shield, and saved you like 3 times."
todayilearned,ffc7zfm,t1_ffc65vy,1579793630.0,"I understand that. Brightside is clubs like these are usually alot more oblivious and easy going. Most people there know what they want and are upfront about it, while others are new or just there for socializing and you can usually tell off the bat. Plus long as you're respectful no real chance at making a S/O mad at you"

ShittyLifeProTips,ffbuec3,t3_esozwr,1579783087.0,"funny story when I worked for fast food. One day we had one of my coworkers go take out the trash, it was like 2pm and at this particular time we were dead (near 3 college campuses so night was our super busy times) not much happened for the next hour when we realized we hadn't seen him for a bit, another hour passes and he pulls up in the drive thru, throws his stuff through the window, and straight up quits. Never seen such a mad lad since."

MadeMeSmile,ff959hk,t3_esa46q,1579705159.0,I remember talking to someone on reddit that truly believed people on the streets were just bad with money. That all poor people cant save so that's why they're poor.
maybemaybemaybe,ff83doj,t3_erwkl6,1579664916.0,I wonder why this happened. looks like the one punching is kinda just messing around and the other guy just yeets him into the water.

thing about CE is the reason the pistol is so strong, thus becoming so iconic. They were ready to ship it and all guns and health were tested and felt great, then literally the day (possibly hours?) before it shipped the lead dev went in thinking the pistol was a tad weak so buffed the damage not having time to test it, then it shipped right away and now we have the super strong one headshot kill pistol we know and love."

leagueoflegends,feopvb2,t1_feol972,1579303716.0,they've lost so bad in there games so far... it really makes no sense. Just gonna chalk it up to a slow start.
Overwatch,fejxvyw,t3_epio7g,1579188348.0,yes only because there was once a time where you could use symmetra to Teleport

LifeProTips,fejv1g8,t3_ephnz3,1579186499.0,or just give to the naked philanthropist. You get stuff in return AND the good feeling you helped the fires.
leagueoflegends,fegzrhk,t1_feguzlg,1579106130.0,"the issue is most of the time you arent just running straight at them and them running straight back. makes his ult super situational. Least with a slight aim it makes him a better jg, more overall damage with his ult, can target a tank and use it to accurately jump a wall and escape a fight or give ur team a better chance. It would make it much more fun to use"
leagueoflegends,fegj0km,t3_eowqyv,1579094259.0,"Sett is so fun but a couple issues right off bat, His W I feel should have some slow built in at least in the outer parts (maybe middle part but then that's true damage + slow and that's a little strong), his ult... feels wonky. Anytime you ult you just jump in the direction you were going. I think you should have a second to change location so it isnt a one man ult more times than not. His Q however feels really good to use and the E is ok. cool mechanic that gives you a little gap closer."

worldnews,fdgev6a,t3_el69i4,1578393523.0,honestly this is the time to send in the impeachment to senate. They either choose to impeach him due to recent events or they prove they arent going to uphold the constitution and that should be enough to get them pulled out of office by popular demand.

NintendoSwitch,fdf31ep,t1_fdf112t,1578352163.0,yeah I guess that's true. especially with no actual release date set
NintendoSwitch,fdf0w2k,t3_ekv4rf,1578350795.0,I am thinking of getting a switch. would it be worth waiting for the new model for any updates they add to it or just getting the one out now?

What is the best tips you have for self teaching yourself coding? Did you ever find yourself feeling like you were going to give up and of so how did you get past that feeling?"

worldpolitics,fcbtytn,t1_fcb3k25,1577590949.0,thought the same thing tbh. But they must think similarly.
worldpolitics,fcaup8c,t1_fcau7hf,1577576976.0,"Bernie has a huge democratic following but that, and his ideals, make him a huge dislike to the right. I dont know if Bernie truly stands a big chance. Yang draws in support from both sides as his ideas are more so forward thinking."
worldpolitics,fcaufjp,t1_fcasso5,1577576825.0,"I can tell you haven't. As someone who grew up poor it wasnt cause we ""couldnt handle money"" it was due to the tons of other things. Business going down, family to feed, housing market crashing yet still being forced to pay for a house less than half its value, jobs not paying nearly as much. You are led to believe they cant handle money, but in most cases, they can. They know how to live off the very little they have so when they get money they're actually much better at spending than most born into it."
worldpolitics,fc95cvq,t1_fc8vmvl,1577547295.0,This is pretty much the main reasoning. It's nice to have a president finally understand technology and push it to the forefront of understanding and trying to work around it before it's to late.

Till he got grey hair at that point it was present time. I figured it out super easily as they give a ton of clues to realize which plays first. the witch literally meets the children that the witcher is in the middle of helping as adults."
