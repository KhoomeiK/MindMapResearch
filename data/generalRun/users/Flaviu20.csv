mentalhealth,fcq9l8c,t3_eihe59,1577881618.0,"You’re going through something pretty serious as it affects me aswell and I feel like it hurts your soul. I try to change with therapy because human contact is an impossible task. Failing to have a conversation in almost a year brought depression and social anxiety so severly that requires medication. 

And I’m only 20 so this means I’m starting adult life friendless. 

When you recover, please send your blessings to a struggling pal right here🙋🏼‍♂️

Best of luck man"
