CAMPUS LEGEND: Red Square was purposefully paved with slippery red brick in the 1960s to inhibit large gatherings of protesting students.

MYTH STATUS: BUSTED!

Red Square — and the parking structure underneath it — was constructed in 1971. Paul Hayden Kirk, a 1937 UW graduate and influential Northwest modernist architect, designed Red Square and much of the surrounding area, including Meany Hall and Odegaard Undergraduate Library. According to Kirk, the design was actually conceived to promote gathering. The plaza ""should be open for the people to use and the big groups to get together,"" Kirk told Don C. Miles in a 1987 interview.

""Kirk is widely recognized as a leader in the development of regional modern architecture in the Northwest,"" said professor of architecture Jeffrey Ochsner. Oschner is the author of Shaping Seattle Architecture, an illustrated guide featuring many of Kirk's local designs.

The name ""Red Square"" was actually proposed before the bricks were even laid. In 1969, the ""Central Quadrangle"" was still a grassy field and a common meeting place for student activist groups. Daily staff writer Cassandra Amesely successfully launched a campaign to refer to the area with the more political and simple moniker ""Red Square.""

Kirk was also open to adding a fountain or sculpture to the area as time went on. Today, the widely recognized Barnett Newman sculpture, Broken Obelisk, which was donated to the University of Washington by the Virginia Wright Fund, is now an essential visual component of Red Square for the modern-day UW student."

It's more likely your symptoms are psychogenic unless you have a specific M.S. symptom like temporary blindness in one eye.  I thought I had MS and then Lyme disease before getting properly treated for anxiety and depression.  The sad reality is that you need to figure out how to get to a free health clinic if you don't have insurance.  Nobody on the internet can diagnose you, and reading about symptoms online trying to self-diagnose is not healthy or effective."
