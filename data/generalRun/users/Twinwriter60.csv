MarriedAtFirstSight,ffd7yhe,t1_ffd7oua,1579815176.0,Right! My two yr old grand daughter makes that same face! LOL
MarriedAtFirstSight,ffd60wi,t1_ffd508n,1579814104.0,"I actually don’t care for Meka. That scene at the wedding with the dress. She came out wearing her dress and a stink face. Like girl, come on! Grow up and deal with it! Get a safety pin, tape! Something but don’t throw a damn temper tantrum!!"
MarriedAtFirstSight,ffc4ppq,t1_ffbiwua,1579791469.0,As rumor goes?
MarriedAtFirstSight,ffc4okw,t1_ffc3l7y,1579791448.0,We’ll just have to wait and see I guess?
MarriedAtFirstSight,ffc4meg,t1_ffbtnpj,1579791406.0,"I don’t know him personally but the rumors are flying. I don’t know if they are true but I’m a believer of If there’s smoke, there’s fire. It doesn’t matter to me if he is or not. But as far as this season goes , too many spoilers being released,things are out of control ."
MarriedAtFirstSight,ffbdbxg,t3_esmyvx,1579760531.0,"Then he has the nerve to file for an Annulment ! What an ass! I’m guessing on the grounds that the marriage was never consummated ? Well, do you blame her? Word on the street is he may be Bi ? Maybe she should have been the one to file !! ???"
MarriedAtFirstSight,ff7y50t,t3_epd7v0,1579661137.0,"I’m disappointed that so many spoilers have been released so early in the season. SM has ruined it for me. I realize it’s a “Reality Show” but it’s not the same show it was Season 1-5. Now it seems the producers only care about drama & ratings. Guess I should have known better from the beginning when I saw that Jaime from Season 1 had already been on a few other reality shows prior to being on season 1. IMHO, this show is DOA."
JUSTNOMIL,ff777qf,t3_erza38,1579642486.0,That would be the final nail on the coffin of that relationship !! Selfish POS bitch! I’m so sorry for your loss.
MarriedAtFirstSight,ff577qq,t1_ff56xni,1579582232.0,Well I must admit to wanting the new IPhone 11 Pro for the camera but it’s cause I take a million pics of my dogs and I’ve seen all the different things you can do with it LOL. But I also know when to put my phone down and enjoy time with my family. I actually own a camera and forget to take pictures at family events because I’m too busy enjoying their company.
