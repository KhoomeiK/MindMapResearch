smallengines,ff9ks5c,t3_esejl5,1579715089.0,"Before getting too crazy, check the manufacturer's recommendations. Generally speaking, 10% ethanol is no big deal. It can be a bit tough on some of the parts that fuel comes in contact with, but nowadays, the manufacturers take this into account. As a homeowner for \~34 years, I've never gone out of my way to use non-ethanol fuel and have never had a fuel related equipment failure. My lot is 150' x 150' and my Toro Personal Pace mower failed due to drivetrain issues, as did my Honda mower (related to the fact that my lot is hilly, \~50' higher at the back of the lot than at the street). I generally get 6 to 8 years out of a mower. I also have a 10 year old snow blower, a 20 year old little Honda rototiller, a 5 KW generator, a pressure washer, and some 2-cycle things (hedge trimmer/weed whacker, a couple chain saws). Also, before the ""gotta run premium"" crowd chimes in,  most if not all manufacturers say 87 Octane is fine, and that's what I run - no backfires or run-ons in temperatures from -5\*F to 110\*F.

All that being said, alcohol attracts water. I drain my tank and carb bowl before storing the machine at the end of the season to avoid issues next year. Some folks like to add Sta-bil fuel stabilizer to the tank and run it through the fuel system instead of draining the tank and carb. Whichever way you go with that is up to you. I know that my way, when I pull the unit out of storage, I add fuel, prime it, and it starts second or third pull - very important when the power goes out and I need the generator to work."

* Exercise the dog - an hour a day of your time isn't a lot to you but would mean the world to the dog, and also can cut down or eliminate bad behavior. A walk is good. A tired dog is a happy dog.
* Put a collar on the dog with name and phone number tag in case it bolts on you.
* Give the dog your unconditional love - no hitting, lots of hugs - reward only good behavior.  Develops a bond.
* Dog food and not human food. The occasional treat is ok but it shouldn't be more than 5% or so of their calorie intake.
* Be careful not to poison the dog - google what foods can be dangerous - raisins, garlic, onions, chocolate to name a few. Some can damage liver & kidneys, others can damage the heart. Chicken bones are absolutely a no-no.

House remained vacant, bank-owned for about 8 years. During that time, the bank had a property management company that did absolutely minimal maint. Shingles blew off, allowing the roof to leak and ceiling drywall to cave. Basement flooded periodically. Property manager dude sometimes didn't click the front door shut, allowing it to blow open on several occasions. I'd close it when I saw it, and on more than one occasion, went beyond the front door - enough that I saw the mold in the flooring, on the walls, in the ceiling where it had caved, and all over the basement. A bit of a horror scene. The pool had trees growing out of the cover - ducks and frogs called it home. A flipper bought it thinking he would make a lot off it. I chatted up some of the laborers and it became apparent that they were all pretty much self-taught. The one guy did masonry, carpentry, plumbing and HVAC; another handled landscaping, decking and pools. They'd grab some day laborers and have at it. Since I work from home, I saw every step of this shit show. I brought the laborers bottles of cold water on hot days, and let the mason use my hose because the house's water was shut off (along with electricity and gas). They'd let me have a peek at the progress while I was out getting the mail or bringing in the trash cans. Flipper cut costs where he could but it was a money pit and in the end, lost several thousand on it.

Sure, we only get 9 hours on the shortest days, but we get 15 hours on the longest days, so on average, we get 12 hours of sunlight just like FL or AZ. The article you linked to seems to state that that production is less here than other places because it's residential and small-business fixed-position arrays rather than arrays that are set up to track the sun for greater output as are created in deserts... per article "" The most likely explanation for this decrease is that utility-scale PV plants are sited in open, sunny areas with the panels pointed in the optimum direction and often with axial tracking capability. Residential and business-scale arrays, however, usually consist of fixed roof-mounted panels that point the way the roof points, which often isn’t the optimum direction. """

It would be practically invisible compared to wind turbines and it only stops briefly every few hours for the change of tides. Wind seems unreliable by comparison.

aww,fcl265t,t1_fckx5ui,1577738182.0,"Same here - one nested under my upper-level deck a couple years ago. I kept waiting for the babies to move out before taking the nest down, but then more eggs appeared. Wash - rinse - repeat. I blocked  the area off in the fall, then the next spring there was another nest in some vines along the top of my 6' fence. And it turns out that these baby birds bail out of the nest before they can fly and scramble for cover until they figure it out, providing entertainment for my three dogs."
