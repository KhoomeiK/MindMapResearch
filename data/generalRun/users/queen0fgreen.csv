They're not being rational but it makes sense when you love a creature and don't want to let go.

I HIGHLY suggest getting an at-home service as another commenter suggested. It is so much more comforting for everyone involved. But for the love of all things good, DO NOT try to get it the last minute. Please make an appointment and be prepared.

I was scrambling and frantically calling all the t home doctors in my area when my boy had a sudden unknown hematoma burst. It was hell not knowing if I could let my boy rest at home or if I had to take him to back to an emergency vet.

relationships,fdpt09j,t3_emdzsp,1578639311.0,"Now I'm no parent but as someone older than her by a year who has friends with young kids, it's rediculous for him to expect her to act like a 1950's wife. She is young; so long as her going out is not impacting her ability to provide and raise her child there is nothing wrong with it in my books. A few nights out every month is not detrimental to her role as a mother.

It sounds like he could be a bit jealous that she's young and enjoying her life and not resigning herself to being just a mom. Maybe remind him that she is a young, multifaceted woman who does deserve to have a life outside of her infant and her husband like most young mothers her age have.

Also maybe remind him it's super gross that he's mad that he's getting 'forced' to care for his young child when she takes time for herself. He is the father of that baby and just as responsible for the rearing and care of it.

The breastfeeding is problematic, from my knowledge she really should be holding off on the drinking and weed until they're weaned but that's really the only point of his I can agree with."

edit: love how all you fucks come straight to downvote this post when it was up by ~25 last night and call me a cunt. did you do that to all the other fucks calling op out for using a shitty way to describe looking after his kid?

babysitting is done by a non-parent and to call watching your own kid babysitting implies that you can just pass the kid back and stop watching after them. you dont babysit your own kid. you watch them just like their mother does. fucking. do. better.
