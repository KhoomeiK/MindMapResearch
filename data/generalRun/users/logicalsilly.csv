Considering that he should be equal to Mou Bu. To make up for it, Hara might start creating over the top generals, even by Kingdom standard."

He said his children were equally intelligent. And he liked to spend his time in training them rather than trying to make more money which didnt drive him. 

Last I saw him, both his children topped their universities and are currently in US pursuing phd. He is happy for them and I am happy for him."

If you are doing good, its all good, but if you are in a bad situation, the desire to fight to change it diminishes. I avoided weed for 7 years for this reason. 2 of my friends who didnt are still stuck in the place they were 10 years ago. 

I will not claim I am happier as i am more successful than them though. They are happy wherever they are. But I'm definitely taking better care of my family."
