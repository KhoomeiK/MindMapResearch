AskReddit,ff4yyrd,t3_ergjyj,1579575832.0,"When I was in high school I used to work at McDonalds. There was one customer that came through the drive-thru every week at 4pm, like clockwork. I remember because it was no sooner than I walked in from school. 

This one particular time, I had to run both windows for a bit and was keeping a steady pace. He rolls up to the speaker and orders a Large Big Mac combo with extra Mac sauce and bacon with 2 apple pies and a large strawberry shake. I repeated the order back to him and thought everything was fine. Rolls up to the window, repeated his order to him, he paid and pulls up to the next window. 

I gave him his order and gave him a moment to check his food and immediately start prepping drinks. He immediately starts screaming that he has an issue. He said his shake order was wrong and that there were no Oreos in it. I repeated his order a 3rd time and he said it was correct. I proceeded to tell him that Oreos don’t normally come in the shake and that he’d have to pay an additional fee (because we know Mickey Ds wasn’t given away toppings for free). 

I swear we were going back and forth about it before he asked to speak to the manager. When I turned around to go and get her, this entitled piece of shit threw the shake at me. I fucking lost it and started calling him everything I could think of. I got to go home that day with full pay after that, but I fuck. I learned at that moment that the customer isn’t always right. 

Fuck that sloppy son of a bitch. I just got pissed again recounting this."

All of her other exes have spoke out about any allegations against them, except Snipes. 

My whole point was that, just like Harvey Weinstein, there are people who turned a blind eye as to what was going on, because in Hollywood, the Box Office reigns supreme.
