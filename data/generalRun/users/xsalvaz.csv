unpopularopinion,ff7qgoh,t1_ff7hnpi,1579655870.0,"No true scotsman doesn't apply in that situation bud. Christianity has a rather specific set of rules to follow which haven't changed since the new testament. People who actively display that they are not following those in the slightest, are not Christian.

I can point to a Civic and tell you it's not a semi-truck. Which isn't a fallacy - it's stating the fact that it fits none of the necessary requirements to be considered a semi-truck.

And no, the old testament isn't valid according to the book itself. People who use poor translations as excuses to judge or hate are not Christian. They're literally what Jesus supposedly hated righteously."
MadeMeSmile,ff7p4jt,t1_ff7ifvj,1579654928.0,I mean I have an Audi and is super easy to remove the bulb or even the whole headlight. It's like 2 screws and a plug
UpliftingNews,ff798pc,t1_ff6male,1579643691.0,"To be fair, it's reasonable to ask someone why they bought and own a car but don't drive/have a license. It's a similar thing."

And on top of that, if there's a travel ban, even if you are scheduled you don't legally have to go in. Your life is more important than a job."

rareinsults,fdw7fub,t3_emzkmb,1578755892.0,I'd be interested to see at what level people consider you black enough that it's acceptable. There are dominant and recessive genes so you could realistically be as pale as her while being 1/4 or even 1/2 black.

worldnews,fdlqf5h,t1_fdktp7n,1578530023.0,I was thinking the US shot it down and blackmailed Iran into not saying anything. That way it looks like they shot down their own plane and the US gains support against them.

worldnews,fdeuq5o,t1_fdeqz44,1578347003.0,Did I say that either? You're trying *really* hard to take it the wrong way. Destroying property does not mean killing citizens.
worldnews,fdep34l,t1_fde69i8,1578343664.0,Did I say that? No. Trump has many properties outside the US. What I said is that I hope they attack Trump.

news,fd2gaeh,t1_fd0gmhy,1578146796.0,"I don't give a fuck about an assassination, what I'm saying is that all that we've done in the middle east gives people there every right to hate the US and want to retaliate. You can't exactly blame someone for wanting to get back at the US when we're the terrorists."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fd2g3a4,t1_fd2cawy,1578146709.0,Wtf? Not at all. I'm mentioning it because the systematic oppression creates a different form of slavery. That's the joke/point.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fd2ace6,t1_fczlwwz,1578144209.0,I mean most in the US have no ties to slavery and are purely ancestors of immigrants like everyone else. Although the ongoing systematic oppression might be a pretty good reason to not want to fight some old white politician's war.

nextfuckinglevel,fcr4vgk,t1_fcmbmzn,1577896807.0,"The point has nothing to do with murders. It's gun deaths because the issue is that there are guns to cause the deaths. So no, mate, what you quoted is irrelevant because suicide via gun is, you guessed it, a death via gun that might not have happened were it not for how easily a gun can kill. More guns doesn't solve anything, quit supporting that shit."
