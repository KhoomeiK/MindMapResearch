That said, most people aren't going to want an answer that long. Another thing I tell people about, especially when they want a short answer is work involving integer complexity. Define ||n|| to be the minimum number of 1s needed to represent a positive integer as a product or sum of 1s using any number of parentheses. We'll call this the integer complexity of n. For example, the equation 6=(1+1)(1+1+1) shows that ||6|| <= 5, and in fact a little playing around will convince you that ||6||=5. One open problem I've worked on is whether for any a>0, ||2^(a)||=2a. That is that a power of 2 always has the best representation the most obvious one. We know that this is true for powers of 3, but we also know it isn't true for powers of 5. In particular, ||5^(6)||=29 which arises from 5^6 - 1 having a lot of small prime factors. This isn't what most research, or even most of my research is like, but it does give people a rough feel for what sort of questions we might be interested in."

In this context, describing Cyrus this way essentially means that he was king that they saw as divinely endorsed. The relevant Bible section where he is referred to this way is Isaiah Chapter 45

Further context: The reason for the very positive view of Cyrus is that he allowed the Jews to return to Israel after the destruction of the First Temple, thus ending the First Exile.

Um, yes repeatedly. And Nazi military intelligence tried to actively undermine him. Read a little bit about [Wilhelm Canaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Canaris).

(See for example Alan Bullock's  ""Hitler: A Study in Tyranny"") And no, Hitler didn't get to power by building a coalition.  In 1932, he failed to get a majority, and pushed for new elections, which resulted in him getting fewer seats in parliament. Hitler then gained power because Papen and Schleicher were so busy  with their own feud that they didn't see Hitler as a threat.  Then later, the Communists spent time fighting with the more moderate left-wing groups rather than opposing Hitler.

todayilearned,feo1rcm,t1_feny1ws,1579293989.0,"How recent do you want? There's a massive amount of work since the 1960s in [error correcting codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code) and you use them all the time without even realizing it. The idea of an error correcting code is the following: Sometimes transmissions of information isn't perfect. If I wrote this sentnce you might not even notice the typos in it snce humans are so good at unconsciously using context to correct for errors. But it turns out that human language isn't that efficient from this perspective. We can engage in error correction sometimes, but in some contexts even detecting an error can be tough. For example, consider the sentence ""I own a pet bat."" Is there a typo there? Maybe I meant ""cat"" instead of ""bat"" but it isn't obvious. What we want to be able to do is to efficiently transmit information (generally in the forms of 1s and 0s) so that either small errors can be corrected, or errors can be at least detected so we can ask for a retransmission. Two examples of this are Hamming codes, and Reed-Solomon codes, both from the 1960s. But modern improvements (I wouldn't say ""breakthroughts"" but definitely improvements) have helped a lot  here also. 

Another one where relevant breakthroughs have impacted your life is cryptography. Your computer needs a way of talking securely to other computers. But there's a problem: Imagine Alice and Bob want to have a secret conversation, but they've never met before. Worse, they are worried that Eve is going to listen in, and Eve might hear anything they say. (Tangent: My spouse is named Eve and it annoys her to no end that in these crypto discussions it is always Eve the Evil Eavesdropper). It would seem that any discussion about how to  make a secret code together will fail, because Eve can listen in and then just decode what they do. But it turns out that it is possible for Alice and Bob to have a conversation where at the end of the conversation they'll have a shared secret code that Eve cannot (we conjecture) figure out unless she has much more computational than Alice or Bob. The easiest way to do this is the [Diffie-Hellman protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) invented in the 1970s. It turns out that one can do something even cooler: It is possible for Alice and Bob to not have to have a conversation at all. Alice can simply post on a website instructions for how to send coded messages to her, and Bob if he follows those instructions will be able to send them to Alice. Eve, even with all the instructions won't be able to decode Bob's messages (again, conjecturally and again assuming Eve doesn't have massive amounts of computer power). The way to do this is [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem\)). And your computer uses these and related protocols whenever it talks to other computers. In fact, the problem I mentioned that my thesis work was on connects to these protocols albeit loosely; you'll notice that the phi(n) function I mentioned earlier shows in RSA, and the ord(a,n) is closely related to the main trick in Diffie-Hellman.

todayilearned,fen6gko,t1_fen2zfw,1579278019.0,"There's a lot we still don't know about phi(n). Here are two basic things we still don't know:

If n is a prime, then phi(n)=n-1. Is there any composite number where phi(n) divides n-1? We don't know, but we do know that if there is such a number it needs to be pretty big (greater than 10^20 ), and it needs to have at least 14 distinct prime factors. The non-existence of such numbers is  known as Lehmer's Conjecture since their non-existence was conjectured by D. H. Lehmer in the 1930s. 

Another question we don't know is Carmichael's conjecture: Carmichael noticed that there are lots of values that phi(n) does not take. For example, it isn't hard to see that phi(n) is never odd except for n=1. Some other values are trickier. For example, one can show with a little work, that phi(n)=14 has no solutions. What Carmichael noticed was that apparently, whenever phi(n) took on a value, another number took on that value for phi also. For example, phi(8)=4, and phi(5)=4. Carmichael asked if this was always the case. (In fact he thought he had a proof of this but then realized his proof was flawed.) In this situation we also know that any counterexample must be very big. In this case, we have a lower bound of at least 10^10^10 .

todayilearned,femw41y,t1_femu8ym,1579271154.0,"It really varies widely. Some people do very applied things, of the sort you are used to. Others study things which are connected to much more abstract ideas .For example, part of my own PhD work was on the following problem: 

For a given positive integer a and another integer n, we want to understand how big the smallest positive integer k is so that a^k leaves a remainder of 1 when we divide by n.  For example, if a =2 and n =5, then one may take k=4, since 2^4 = 16 which leaves a remainder of 1 when we divide by 5. Similarly, if a=4 and n=7, then k = 3, since 4^3 = 64 which leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 7. 

Such a k doesn't always exist, but it has been known since Euler that such a k exists whenever a and n don't share any common factor greater than 1. In fact, Euler proved a much stronger result: Let phi(n) be the number of positive integers which are less than or equal to n, and which share no common factor greater than 1 with n. For example, phi(8) = 4 since 1, 3, 5 and 7 all share no common factor with 8.  Then Euler proved that if a and n share no common factor, then a^phi(n) leaves a remainder of 1 when I divide by n.
So, the k we care about is always at most phi(n). (It also turns out that k must divide phi(n) but that takes a little work.)

Trying to understand what a typical such k looks like has been an ongoing problem, and some of my work narrowed that down. If for a given a and n, we write ord(a,n)  to be k, then one natural thing to do is to look at phi(n)/ord(a,n). Part of my work looked at how large this quantity was on average given a fixed a.

There are a lot of alternatives to ranked choice (and the name ""ranked choice"" is misleading in that it makes it sound like it is the only system that involves ranking of choices). Copeland's method is much better than ranked choice. 

Here's one example of how ranked choice fails to be a good system: it is not [monotone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonicity_criterion), meaning that someone can cause a candidate to lose by placing the candidate higher in their preferences. Let's look at an example: Assume there are 7 voters with preference ABC, 8 with preference BCA, 10 with preference CAB and 2 with preference   ACB.


Under ranked-choice/IRV, B is eliminated first, and then C wins. But suppose in the final column we were to swap A and C. Then A is now eliminated first, then B beats C. So pushing C up higher in some voters caused C to lose. The idea here is that C had a really persuasive ad-campaign or something similar, and then lost as a result! This is not the only problem with ranked-choice/IRV but it is one of the most severe. 

Many other systems do not have this problem. For example, a [Borda count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count) does not have this problem. In a Borda count with n candidates, each first place vote is worth n points, each second place, n-1 and so on, and then whoever has the most points wins.

One other notable system is [Copeland's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copeland%27s_method), sometimes called the round robin method or tournament method. In this method, every pair of candidates goes up against each other based on the rankings, and we ask which candidate would win if there were no candidates but that pair. Whoever wins match-up gets 1 point, and the loser gets 0. In a tie, they each get 1/2 point. Then whoever has the most points wins. This method also does not have many of the problems of IRV."
