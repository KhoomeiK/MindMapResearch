aww,ff8p12q,t1_ff8ojds,1579689741.0,"We had cat 3 for nearly a year, year and a half. During which I had conversations with So about the fact her favorite target was cat 2 of the mild heart murmur. 
Then cat 4 stepped out of a carrier on a trial house visit,  head bumped cat 3, tipped his head for bc to lick his ears, and nose booped the mutt and cat 2... before settling in the middle of the floor with his paws tucked. 
Two weeks later he was cuddled up on the couch with cats 2 and 3.  cat 1  now has the same ""leave me alone and I won't threaten your life"" relation ship she has with cat 2 with cat 4, although she still treats cat3 as an obnoxious interloper if she goes in her bedroom.
Cat 1 was found at 6mths on the side of a road, cat 2 was under a park bench at 6 weeks (4 some years later), cat 3 jumped on husband's shoulder and refused to let him leave the farm with out her at 8 mths, and my family found cat 4 this summer under an apartment dumpster, 3/4 starved, missing a chunk of tail, and already neutered."
aww,ff8oduz,t1_ff8ny3g,1579688780.0,It's better since we added the last cat. We went from 3 cats who couldn't stand each other to 3 cats that cuddle and one who remains done with everyone's shit. (And even she's still being more sociable and visible than usual.)

aww,feydlr5,t1_fey3lfz,1579444176.0,"I've got one of those. He's the cuddler, the human food thief, and the peacekeeper to the other cats.  Damn good cat. But I had him a month before it occurred to me that despite having cats of their own, my family wouldn't have thought to vet him in the two weeks between finding him under a dumpster and rehoming him to me. Off to the vet we went, and he was finally tested and checked for a microchip.  FIV+, neutered male, no records. 
(He has like all possible shots now, a chip, and isn't allowed out. Not that he's interested in outside at all. Inside is where the cheese and the cuddles are.)"

To be fair, my wedding expectations were ""I want a dress and a cake."" I compromised to a cheese cake tier thing with sugar roses on top. because my husband doesn't like cake cake, but we both like cheesecake. Counting the church that extended family( who then had shit come up and missed any way) insisted on,(honestly, my preference would have been for a Wiccan handfasting)  and the catering my mom insisted on on and paid for, it came to about 1000 total, about 200 over my preferred budget.

My move her out before my agility prospect came home plan was based around the fragility and impressionable nature of tiny, new puppies. Fionn survived the chicken bones and chocolate, and had a normal level of rule following to go back to. The puppy, on the other hand...."
JUSTNOMIL,fdjevgc,t1_fdjdr3z,1578467874.0,"It was an aggravating stay. We had a four-year old corgi mutt, who was in barn hunt and working toward his cgc. He had resource guarding issues, so he wasn't allowed table scraps without working for them.  Enter my mom. ""Oh, look, he just ate that stack of cheesy crackers I had on the coffee table."" ""Did you tell him no, leave it, like we told you?"" "" Well, no, but..."" A month in, this dog is apparently the food thief of the century. Even though I can still leave him with a plate of steak and a ""leave it"" without him so much as sniffing it. ""Your dog ate my entire family size pack of oreos! You need to buy me a new box, lol."" You gonna pay for his vet bill if he gets sick off that much chocolate, mom? She invites him up onto her lap on thanksgiving and let's him up on the table itself. She drops chicken wings on the floor and goes  ""oh, well, at least he's happy""
It took months, actual trainer time, and compliant yo house rules visitors to break all the bad habits she taught him."
JUSTNOMIL,fdj98aa,t1_fdhm5ib,1578462126.0,"That's what we worried about after we finally got my mom moved out.  She asked if ""wouldn't it be better if I kept a set for emergencies? What about your cats and my granddog? The new grand puppy you're  getting in a week?""
""Mom, jygmil lives two doors down and has keys. What emergency could you help with she can't? And we already trade dog emergency check-ins with her and her 5 poms. Keys, please.""
So she sighed and said shed bring them over when she had a chance, but It was sad we didn't trust her. Bitch, I didn't even get into the fact we set your move out deadline to make sure you were never in the same house as the new puppy. After all the bad habits and the chicken bone and chocolate incidents with the older dog, you're never going to be unsupervised with the pup I spent a year on the waiting list for. I love my mom, I just don't trust her as far as I can throw her.  
So I hung up the phone, looked at my SO, and agreed with his plan. A month later, I've been talked into dinner with my FOO, and as I was leaving, my mom admits ""she lost the keys, she's so sorry, she meant to give them back""
""That's fine, we already changed the locks."" And cbf  for days."

I love them, but two screaming fits and I was done with this creature living in what used to be my playroom. And the more I was forced to interact and look after them, the less I liked them.  Ten years later they were...better, but we still didn't have a positive relationship until I moved out. We still can't go more than 10 hours straight together without needing a break to prevent a screaming fight."
BanPitBulls,fcss7ng,t1_fcrzxv0,1577923784.0,"My border collie got himself fixed out of the gene pool despite being the prettiest and sweetest dog his breeder has produced for one simple reason. 
He's afraid of sheep.  He still goes full stalk if you break out the flirt pole, but frisbee and giant sticks are his jam.
Dogs that flunk the instinct they're bred to have exist. It's just that you can't predict which ones will, and even then it might wake up. If my dog walked past a schoolyard and decided to herd kindergarteners, I wouldn't have the right to be surprised. And I certainly shouldn't try to convince people that collies don't herd based on my best being photogenic."
insaneparents,fcpzjym,t1_fcpyd3c,1577875529.0,"Or we can explain all the possibilities, and let people decide what they are without assuming they're just questioning or going through a phase.   If I'd had support that I was allowed to just be attracted to everyone as I was, that it didn't make me a straight kid in a phase or a confused lesbian trying to figure things out, I would have been able to shrug off a lot of shit I took as a teenager. Attraction isn't something your curious about. It is, or it isn't, even if it might not be there for the reasons you think.  You can be gay, or straight , bi or pan without ever so much as kissing anyone else, and know it.

Which is why Op's support matters to their sister, no matter what thr parents say. Bicurious is a pretty phrase that lets people blow off the idea or deny how you actually feel. Source, had it tossed at me by any number of people who claimed to want what's best for me. Usually before they suggested a day to fix me."
insaneparents,fcpxphb,t1_fcpv4b7,1577874399.0," Whatever her sister identifies as is allowed to change, without bothering with intermediate whatever curious titles. If she's interested in both and likes the term bi, then she's bi. 
When I was 13, I knew everyone was pretty, but I didn't have the education to put that into ""because I like both"" as apart from ""when am I  supposed to find interest in the difference between boy people and girl people?"" My squees over Antonio Banderas (thirteenth warrior era) were called a crush, my equal interest in Xena and Gabriel were overlooked.  It wasn't until my best friend came out to me and asked me out, with a single letter, that I had real context for what I was feeling. She then spent a year trying to convince me I was a confused lesbian because I did like her but some guys were still just as cute as girls were. If I'd had more explained to me and had support, highschool would have been easier.  I identify as pan more often than bi these days, but being able to call myself bi would have been something.  Not curious, not confused, just attracted to everyone to the point the whole only interested in one gender baffled me. 
Straight people have tried to explain. I still think it must be weird to walk through the world and have half the pretty people just not make your brain go blug."

Since I knew about the history of that farms indifference to dogs killing the barncats, I let her stay. 
She promptly started making the 5 year old cats life heck and trying to upset our already cranky 9 year old cat.  Three cats who hate each other is too much.
And then my brother found a cat under a dumpster, and pleaded for me to foster it away from their tiny apartment and it's unfriendly cats. This cat walks into my house, nose booped the newest cat, headbutts the middle cat, and let's the border collie lick it s ears.  A week later, three of my cats are asleep in a pile on the couch.  Even miss now 11 cranky butt hates him less than she hates the other cats.

Phone is much easier to clean, and lends itself to conversation far better. Instead of sharing out of context funny or interesting quotes, we can hold up and share cute or funny memes or pictures. If I'm with my grandmother, I'm usually on r/aww looking for kitten pics for her. Or I'm in my gallery, looking for that one picture I took last week.

Or I can go back on my kindle app and enjoy socialization by osmosis(my favorite form) for as long as the dregs of my social battery linger."
