So if you actually read the bible cursing is saying something along the lines of i hope you burn in hell or something to that effect. Swearing is saying i swear (on my life, to God etc..) one english word for feces vs another word for it is not cursing or swearing. One word for a sex act vs another is not swearing or cursing, so if you are about to hit a car and say oh shit you neither cursed or swore. The idea that one particular english word but not any other word that means the same thing can be a sin is absurd and not supported anywhere in the bible. 

I was trying to convince my father that drinking a glass of whine is clearly not a sin. This should not be hard since Jesus both turned water into wine but also commanded Christians to drink wine in remembrance of him. 

Anyway first he tried to say wine now is not the same as wine now, that wine now is way more powerful. So I pointed out that no wine makers pride themselves in doing it the same way forever etc.  He then tried to claim the water was not safe to drink so everyone had to drink something with alcohol in it and thats why Jesus turned the water into wine. I was so flabbergasted that I just stammered that no you are thinking of middle ages England that he turned their drinking water into wine. I did not think to say so Jesus can turn water into wine but not into safe drinking water!

WORLD—In a statement that surprised nearly no one, Satan, the accuser and enemy of God and His people, paused briefly from roaming the earth seeking someone to devour Wednesday to confirm to reporters that he is responsible for the entire white supremacist movement worldwide.

“Oh yeah, that’s all me. For sure,” said the wicked one Lucifer, adding that he’s “really been on a roll lately with this particular gig.”

“I’m quite proud of this hell-filling racket. It’s as anti-biblical as anything can be, causing human beings made in the image of God to be seen as subhuman and expendable, but do you see how tons of them even invoke the name of God as justification for hating everyone who isn’t white? Purely satanic. Some of my best work, honestly.”

So check this out: local avowed white supremacist Richard Wilson actually thinks he is a Christian. LOL!

Reacting to the grotesque racism and violence displayed in Charlottesville over the weekend, Wilson reportedly invoked the name of the Lord. “God is on our side,” the man who espouses a clearly satanic worldview said to one source, who confirmed also that Wilson regularly refers to himself as a Christian and considers white supremacist ideals to be in line with God’s will, and not an evil worldview from the very pit of hell.

So funny! Can you even believe it?

And if that weren’t enough, the man even thinks Jesus and a host of other people in the Bible were Caucasian. He reportedly has a picture of a pale white Jesus hanging in his house! And he’s not even being ironic about it!

TIFTON, GA—Local white supremacist and product of incest Randy Biggums isn’t shy about his radical beliefs regarding race in America, telling reporters Saturday that Caucasians have a moral responsibility to maintain “genetic purity” by only marrying other “purebred” members of the European race.

“It’s about doin’ what’s right, it’s about keeping white people white, and that’s what’s right,” Biggums said. “We owes it to our future generations of Aryan people—all them babies yet to be born—we gotta keep all the other tainted colors out of our race. For a white to marry someone from another race is inpure and ain’t natural, and it’s an abomination!”

“Us whites are genetically superior and we gotta keep our blood pure!” added the inbred man.

Biggums went on to decry the “terrible influence of non-whites” in America, which he claims is dumbing down society and diluting the pure heritage of Caucasians, before ending the interview to head to the gas station for a couple packs of Pall Malls and a six-pack of Busch in preparation for an afternoon of watching WWE.
