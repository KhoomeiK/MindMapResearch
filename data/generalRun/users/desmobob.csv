funny,fechtje,t3_eobw66,1578974260.0,"I am not a religious person. I believe in evolution and I know how certain behaviors are reinforced over time and are thus propagated through the generations as an organism evolves. But there is no way, no WAY, science alone can explain what this bird is doing and why he is having such a good time doing it."

dogs,fe0az6e,t1_fe080qx,1578808223.0,"The moral code that matters in your scenario is the law, and the law sees dogs as property. It's a perfectly apt analogy, you just don't like it. You don't treat dogs like property and neither do I, but I do see other people's property as just that. If I encounter a situation that I determine requires intervention, I enlist the proper authority's assistance. The rest is just a bunch of who shot John."
dogs,fe064ph,t3_enfn3x,1578804016.0,"You're walking down the street and you notice a wallet laying on the ground. You take it home to find an ID, and going through the wallet you find $1000 cash and a bunch of papers, along with an ID. Thumbing through the papers, you find business cards from massage parlors and pawn shops. There's condoms, gambling debt markers and a cellophane of coke, and some other items that suggest this may be a disreputable character. Seeing how he spends his money and the kinds of activities he engages in, do you call to tell him you found his wallet or keep it to prevent him from spending his own money on things you disapprove of?"
dogs,fdtn9ex,t3_emtk6k,1578719231.0,"Nobody who wants to be in a stable, mature relationship ever uses ultimatums to manipulate their significant other. It's a toxic and malicious way of exercising control. If she ever says it's her or the dog, she walks, or you'll be unhappy for duration of the relationship. However long that is."
dogs,fdtly0f,t3_en077r,1578718675.0,"It's not racist; dogs aren't capable of that particular mindset. You shouldn't be embarrassed, either, for neither you nor your dog are making a judgement. Fear of the unknown? That's something dogs are really good at! It's just a matter of exposure. If you look at the training for service/assistance dogs, part of the process is exposing the dog to people of different races, different heights, people in wheelchairs and using walkers etc. I have a friend who's 6'-9"", and one of my dogs just can't get enough of him! Who knows why, but at the end of the day you just have to make sure to expose your dog to as many people and things as is practical."
dogs,fdtl8v6,t3_en2ejh,1578718381.0,"Some people don't know that they're a dog person, but dogs know. And they're never wrong."
dogs,fdbyp2a,t1_fdbh73o,1578263971.0,"What they mean is that you're walking around pumping anxiety into your dog, increasing the likelihood that chance encounters with another dog---which are usually uneventful---will result in conflict."

dogs,fcyggvd,t3_ejjemb,1578079695.0,The dog is not perfect for your grandpa; he already has an owner. Either do nothing (preferable) or call animal control.
dogs,fbfu550,t3_ed3gci,1576821102.0,"You sound enthusiastic, informed, and realistic about your expectations. Just like anything else in life, sometimes things just don't work out. You do yourself a disservice by trying to figure out what *you* did wrong when it may very well have been their mistake. 

If you think you'd provide a good home for a dog looking for one, then keep the faith, because you're right. Soon enough you'll be sharing your life with a dog that will change your life; keep an open mind and an open heart and it's inevitable!"
