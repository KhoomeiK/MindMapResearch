HongKong,ffc137j,t3_esoa35,1579788845.0,There is no political system anymore. The governments and corporations are intertwined. Together they have more money than all of us and they own all of their “citizens”. We cannot buy them out. But we can’t accept small handouts from the government and while they take even more. The protests in HK and other countries are just the beginning. Their fates and ours are the same.
datingoverthirty,ffbzlqe,t3_esqvvt,1579787686.0,"I used to feel like this a lot. In my mind I got too involved with people. I’d even ignore more important things while thinking about “potential” with someone else. 

I noticed it was kind of painful when things didn’t work out so I started focusing on the present more. If I started to think about something I’d remind myself to check back in with reality. The reality is I’m walking home from work, I’m pumped to eat dinner soon, and I want to pet my dog, etc... 

In my experience, attempting to predict human behavior can become a bad habit that can have a lot of different consequences. The more often I did it the less I noticed I was even doing it."
datingoverthirty,ffb47qg,t3_escert,1579751361.0,"Wow he sounds not well. This isn’t your fault. Some people are excellent manipulators and it isn’t just one lie that you happen to believe but a series of developments in the foundation of your relationship altogether (which were manipulated and controlled by your ex). He set up a situation in which you were disrupting the relationship if you questioned him. That’s BS. 

I’m sure you’ll have concerns regarding lying and so forth in future relationships. If necessary, reflect on the type of people you enjoy being with and especially your boundaries. You’ve the right to say “no “ or make note of behavior which is unacceptable to you. I know we feel deeply for people we’ve been with but F this type of behavior."

The self esteem drop has a lot to do with the types of conversations being held: “negotiating” relationships so the other person could sleep with me as quickly and easily as possible, as well as the “tantrums” when I’d say no. The tantrum and whining really brought me down. It was bizarre because I felt that their complaining was dehumanizing but I also had to mother them while they whined about it."

datingoverthirty,ff2o7dh,t3_er7m65,1579515961.0,"I (f) hope I’m answering this correctly. I have a lot of positive views of dick pics. 

On a platform like Tinder (I haven’t used other OLD) I often asked for dick pics ETC. In the past I’d used OLD for “casual dating”. 

The problem I have found with asking for dick pics is that I often feel, uhh, satisfied. So there is a significant chance I won’t meet someone who has sent DP because I guess I lose interest or expend sexual energy prior to meeting them and move on (the pace of tinder is quite fast for women IMO). 

In fact, I think all the people I’ve actually met didn’t send DP but I was pretty bad at the tinder thing and didn’t meet many matches in the first place. However the pre-DP trade was definitely a factor. It’s possible that I didn’t take them as seriously (subconsciously) and even if I wanted to meet a couple of them (who’d send DP)—the low rates of meeting people already pushed them out. 

I don’t think OLD/tinder is the only place to send DP but it has in the past been otherwise consensual (from partners)."

datingoverthirty,ff1oqsg,t1_ff0laaw,1579482816.0,"Yeah I agree with this. I think a lot of people think something casual sounds nice because the expectations are less or they’re emotionally not ready to have a relationship. This isn’t really true it’s just that the expectations and needs are different. 

In actuality a casual relationship is best maintained when one does have standards for the relationship and knows what they want (relationships/life). A casual relationship shouldn’t be used when one is, in general, “not sure” what they want or what works for them or is “tired” of being in a relationship."

AskReddit,fewhddx,t3_eqies2,1579410603.0,"My best friend and I were living in different countries in very different time zones. 

I was on the subway with another friend who’d never met the best friend. I saw an older woman who looked exactly like my best friend except that we were both about 21 at the time. I think it’s kind of stupid when people say “that person looks like a person I know but you don’t” but she legit looked so much like my friend but old that I couldn’t help but say something. 

Later in the day I go to sleep. I wake up to a message that my best friend had died the night before. The timing would have been around when I’d seen her elder-twin on the subway. I think about this all the time."
datingoverthirty,fevl4kj,t3_eqjop6,1579398709.0,"It might be more infrequent than meeting people who do drink but perhaps you can ease this by just making your own recommendations for dates and stating a preference for hanging out sober at least during the first two or so dates. It’s reasonable to say “I’d like to get to know you over coffee first and go from there”.  I definitely enjoy getting to know people more when we are both sober but alcohol is also a common part of culture and lifestyle. 

If you’re concerned about heavy drinkers (for lack of a better term) then try to prepare dates that will let you get to know their sober personality more and maybe slowly introduce alcohol. Like a dinner where they could order a drink, but not a bar. I’d definitely let them know that you don’t enjoy drinking but you might have to demonstrate some flexibility with their drinking (and voice whatever that is). If this isn’t possible—that’s okay too—it might take more time to find people who are completely sober but it’s not impossible. 

A strong recommendation: date lifters. They often don’t drink as alcohol negatively impacts strength training and they often have keen personal health standards. They can have very busy schedules though."
datingoverthirty,fevh6ys,t1_fevacl8,1579397390.0,Yeah I understand that. It’s not like you’re just throwing people around. It’s completely possible to be respectful while seeing more than one person. I think this is pretty normal but people get hyper concerned about dating and then develop social norms about exclusivity. In reality getting to know someone seems more complex to me. It’s a mix of both following social cues and also taking your time I guess lol
datingoverthirty,fev9659,t1_fev824r,1579394612.0,"Yeah it’s that “expectation” in their minds that seems to really bring them down. Especially involving other people you would think they’d (any human) learn to be flexible with expectations. 

But what I don’t get is if you go on a date you’re already ahead—if they say “okay, no problem! I had fun and hope to see you again”—it would probably increase their chances of going out with someone as opposed to their public pity parties."
datingoverthirty,fev58cd,t1_fev0nzt,1579393241.0,Give him a review lol. Is this what happens when women/people are objectified repeatedly in the media?

datingoverthirty,fev2mp4,t1_fesvv7o,1579392435.0,You have to be real with yourself. A lot goes on in our minds while very little occurs in reality. Check your reality and accept it. Let’s say your reality is “she’s not interested and you won’t see her again—> so now it’s you walking to the mart”. That’s what’s up. Now that you have this open headspace what would you like to do with it?
datingoverthirty,fev1dh8,t3_eqeolf,1579392028.0,"The way he mentioned liking you and not seeing other women makes it sounds like you might have (from his perspective) already had the exclusivity talk. That might come up again in the future so maybe be prepared. 

IMO three weeks isn’t that long to get to know someone. I see the six dates in there but I still think that time is the key to seeing genuine personality and lifestyle. It’s important to me to understand what they are like without me—without the giddiness of a date or expectations of another person—what they’re like on their own. 

I would give it some more time before exclusivity but tbh if you like him and things are going well I think a better approach is not more people but more time getting to know this one person. Getting to know someone is not putting all your eggs in the basket because you can always say “no thank you” if you find you’re not interested later. Plus, taking your time will allow you to pick up on anything (such as red flags) if necessary. 

If you busy yourself with other people then you’ll just have a handful of people in the same boat—you don’t know them as well and perhaps don’t have the time/energy to seriously get to know them."

If you’re simply dating perhaps it’s not necessary to detail it. If they ask why you could do the lifestyle approach or be straight up. 

If they’re upset (whether they know it involves their drug use or not)—it is up to them to manage their own emotions and responses. You are not responsible for protecting them or their feelings."

I’m curious what field you work in but I understand if you don’t wish to disclose it.

Also, maybe the fact you’re working together is part of the general weirdness. If he’s not into other coworkers mingling but he likes you, then he might be confused about how to approach a relationship without it seeming like one of the other “thirsty” coworkers. Especially if other women have made it clear they’re interested in him. 

Perhaps the flirting type of touch which we might do more casually or even in public is harder to express or he’s concerned about coming off too desperate. Anyway, you may need to talk to him more about the work stuff—separate your relationship from that."
datingoverthirty,feghw05,t1_fefgt7v,1579093273.0,"Oof. Agreed with other commenter—ask her for the references or keep the professional window open.

Those things might be nice but everything has its pros and cons. In comparison to the opportunity to live life at all—sex and relationships fall short. You are still here which means you still have potential. There is comfort in potential because honestly most people are living in the hopes of some version of “potential”.

sexover30,fegf2lx,t3_ep0ado,1579090575.0,"This question is definitely better answered by your doctor. 

You mentioned peeing and “cleaning” afterward. The vagina is self-cleaning and it’s not necessary to clean it yourself. Over cleaning can change the flora of your vagina causing imbalances which may result in the overgrowth of fungi, bacteria, etc and perhaps infections or irritation.

datingoverthirty,feg8bwc,t3_eoy2qw,1579081853.0,"This is hypothetical for me since I’ve no experience. I see that the process you’ve explained has no exact guarantee but seeing that you caught it early—I’d say continue with your life. If the cancer spreads or your condition changes paths in some way, then perhaps you’d reconsider. 

I wouldn’t worry too much about telling someone. If you’re still interested and able to date then you’ll likely find a point where it’s comfortable or necessary to inform them. 

Lastly, if things (sorry for the phrasing) take a less positive turn—you’ll probably find yourself interested in your children more as well as the little things or things which are not typically on your mind.
