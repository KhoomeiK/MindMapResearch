You have the stupid people who didn't know how to drive in the first place, the people who can drive but hit some ice and have no idea how to react, plus the government who don't have salt ready for it.

Blessing was a amazing pick up and has been great on everything he's been on. The Gamescast with their more focused topics have kept me WAY more interested and wanting to listen. First Impressions have been fucking amazing. It's just them shooting the shit and playing some games. Plus the game selections for the First Impressions have been perfect.

You can honestly tell that you guys give a shit about your community, you remember people at meet ups, you give people from the community jobs. You hired Imran after Game Informer higher ups acted like people didn't matter, you then gave a week of your staple shows to Game Informer people in a time where their world was shook. You gave a community member a chance to host your flagship show with Xavier Woods, giving KFGD a full black cast. You recognized how important that was too, I remember the tweet about how proud you were. As a fan I was proud too. 

What I'm getting at is Greg Miller don't you ever apologize for being too trusting. Your good heart has changed way more lives for the better and it is nothing to apologize over.

It also is looking iffy for E3's future. With Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft all doing Directs, you gotta wonder if the show will have titans to bring Hype announcements in the future. I hope I'm wrong cause E3 is always a highlight for my year. Maybe this just means it'll be more of a developer show."

They do a unbelivable job of keeping the quality high and matching the manga's artwork as best as they can. The Deku vs Bakugo fight after United States of Smash is one of my favorite animated fights in shonen. 

Plus, they do like no filler. There are a few episodes like maybe 7 throughout all the seasons that are 'filler' but honestly they all add a lot to the other characters in the show. They aren't like Naruto and One Piece filler where one character turns into a car or something stupid. 

I would for sure give the anime a chance. The music is great, the animation is great, it's all just awesome. Plus if you're a dub watcher like me, the voice actors for the dub are pretty freaking fantastic. Chris yelling United States of Smash gives me chills every time.
