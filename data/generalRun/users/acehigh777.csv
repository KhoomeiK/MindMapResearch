oaklandraiders,ff4d8n1,t1_ff26y66,1579560863.0,It's a good rationale but imagine living in a city where Niners are blasting celebrations throughout the whole fucking year.  I don't think it is so ez of a choice imo.

madlads,fdf7pcb,t1_fcne7nx,1578355232.0,Me too. The worst thing about it for me is it leaves toilet seat cover like taste in my mouth.

news,fcy2e4v,t1_fcxlyj3,1578073880.0,no shit sherlock. it's self defense but there wasnt imminent harm
news,fcwkgcq,t1_fcwjo5g,1578028089.0,I have been fully acknowledging the law's ability to sympathize with the father through outlets of jury nullification and no sentencing.  It could have been achieved while protecting due process.
news,fcwhge9,t1_fcw8l5z,1578025724.0,"It is absolutely not pointless to condemn an act of vigilante justice, and it is the court's responsibility to educate the people that due process matters.  

&#x200B;

Do you honestly not see a hypothetical scenario where this father mistakenly understands a situation as being victimized and retaliates in full force without a just cause?  Fucking yikes."
news,fcvzo4c,t1_fcvz5ma,1578013765.0,"Heat of the moment defense reduces degree of crimes like 1st degree murder to 2nd degree manslaughter -- but it still calls a wrongful act for what it is, a crime.  Was there imminent threat after the father landed the first punch? second punch? .... tenth punch?

I am actually puzzled that my comment about this is so triggering to people.  Everyone got the part where I said ""without a real sentence"" right?"
news,fcvxulu,t1_fcvxm4x,1578012569.0,You are muffling two categories between 1)vigilante justice and 2)self-defense(imminent threat is the key word here).  1 is never condoned in the eyes of law because of due process.
news,fcvubyr,t1_fcvsy6x,1578010286.0,"Because our justice system has due process where the accuser doesn't get to be the judge, jury, and executioner."
news,fcvraxp,t3_ej4qrm,1578008327.0,"Unpopular opinion, feels like the father should have been charged and convicted for 3rd degree without a real sentence.  And of course in saying this I am for throwing the book at the pedophile to the fullest extent."

nfl,fc6wgd4,t1_fc6v5ju,1577491261.0,Yea 3rd and 5th before his preseason drama looked like a steal at that time... didn't play a single game for us tho.
nfl,fc67e6s,t3_egen5c,1577473978.0,I really hope he gets another ring.
nfl,fc67945,t3_egbb83,1577473884.0,We all knew he was coming back to the league.  Teams get thirsty before playoffs and its probably for a prove it contract too.

Traeger,fbyijn8,t3_ef67fe,1577217771.0,If its cooked you can just wrap with foil and store in a ice chest to maintain the temperature.  Not sure what the target temperature is for prime ribs tho.
