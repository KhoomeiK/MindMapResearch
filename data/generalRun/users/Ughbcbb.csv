In apartheid south america, half-black was its own category, subjected to different laws, while america had the one-drop rule. East europeans position themselves as white in opposition to their roma minorities, and they can be seen and treated in more pale western countries as a suspiciously dark, non-white foreigner (who is probably a thief). There are a lot of ethnicities in america that used to be considered not-white, but are white now. You can't just use science to decide which categorization is right in any of these cases, bc you don't have scientifically sound definitions to start from. (You can, on the other hand, give race-informed advice like ""you might want to check if you tolerate lactose if you are not from the areas where the lactose-digesting mutation is wide spread"", but that doesn't map perfectly to cultural concepts of race (unless your data was taken like that to begin with, so you do your best with what you have)."
