I'm still paying less than my rent was for about 500 more sqft, but I am now looking to refi just to maybe get my rate down a half a percentage but also reset my LTV ratio with a new appraisal and get out of PMI (I'm also willing to pay in a little to meet the 22%)"

Only fix is a player was locked into only one eligible position, NBA has that with frontcourt and backcourt now. The only way this can happen in the NBA is for a few voters decide to ignore position for like a 2-3 wing. If someone made an argument for a player like Jimmy Butler where they're guarding and playing like a forward in small ball lineups x% of the time so I'm going to put him as a forward instead of guard.

sports,fd2c0p9,t1_fczd9b8,1578145020.0,"Football is very cyclical and just because they had a bad year doesn't mean it's a bad team next year. There's about 40-50% roster turnover year over year and so many injuries. Trades are also very rare in football, there's a hard salary cap and the contracts are mostly not guaranteed, so there's no trading for cash. Also it's a closed system due to no other country playing it, so there's only 32 teams total.
