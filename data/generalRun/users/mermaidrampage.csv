Parenting,ff82lh8,t1_ff6dit2,1579664337.0,This is encouraging to read.  In the baby stage now and not having a great time tbh
AdviceAnimals,ff7zjeg,t1_ff68xf5,1579662118.0,"Man, my wife and I just had a baby about 2 months ago.  We're in a good spot job-wise/financially, did lots of research, waited until a time where we felt ready...and it's still pretty damn difficult.   My wife has been doing an amazing job but it's still taxing with the two of us as a team.  Knowing that a fair amount of people who have kids are like this lady really kind of explains the prevalence of so many shitty people in the world."
CampingandHiking,ff3tgmn,t3_erdsfe,1579548486.0,I'm huge fan of Davis Mountains State Park.  Its also in a good spot on the way to BBNP (depending on where you're driving from) to break up the drive a bit
Miami,feytnb8,t3_eqww9m,1579450353.0,I don't even have words to describe that.  The video is unbelievable.  The fact that he can say all of those things and keep a straight face...I think he should get out of law enforcement and start a career in acting.  Fucking embarrassing that people like this are allowed to have jobs in positions of power.

nextfuckinglevel,fedibi6,t1_fedbue5,1579012257.0,He put cardboard in a wood stove (apparently a big no-no).  It sent sparks/embers out through the chimney and lit the roof on fire.
nextfuckinglevel,fedi60h,t1_fedd6x2,1579012145.0,"My question is still how did he get out there in the first place?  It says its 20 miles from the nearest town so the only explanation i can think of is that somebody dropped him off and left him there. 

You'd think somebody living out there by themselves would think to invest in an EPERB or emergency radio."

Miami,fe2rn0h,t1_fe2i1pj,1578842099.0,"You should check out Spillover.  Same people, also in the grove.  The Bababooey burger is my favorite of the three restaurants"
Miami,fe2rjw1,t1_fe2ijxo,1578842051.0,Good price?  Havent been in a while but they were getting up in the 14-15 dollar range for the cheaper ones which seems pretty pricey to me.  Used to be a but more reasonable when they opened

Also you have one of my favorite reddit usernames I've come across so fat"
Miami,fdrol4r,t1_fdrbq33,1578687406.0,"Technically the steaks were only $1000 per steak.  Still absurd but given the prices for everything else that was on the guy's bill ($50 for  2 orders of baklava, $56 for 2 grey goose martinis, etc) I wouldn't be surprised if they just glanced over the price without thinking."
Miami,fdro2h5,t1_fdrhfjr,1578687254.0,Shitty people fucking over other shitty people.   Can't say I'm bothered.

Damnthatsinteresting,fdfoqjs,t3_ekusuy,1578366598.0,"God I loved Edinburgh.   I barely got to spend 24 hours there (over 3 days on either end of a road trip) but the feel of that city was just incredible.  Funny enough, this street was one of the first places I went to go pick up a jacket for a wedding from Walker Slater (highly recommend this place).  Also an amazing whisky shop called...the Whisky Shop."

Should've said ""walking venereal disease"""
todayilearned,fd3lj8p,t1_fd35eeb,1578159476.0,Hey don't insult dried nuts by associating them with that douchecanoe.  Dried nuts are delicious
todayilearned,fcxe1a8,t1_fcx4xm3,1578060436.0,The opening of one of Bourdain's books (Medium Raw) starts with a secret dinner with a bunch of top tier chefs eating ortolan.  His writing and description is brilliant.
therewasanattempt,fcu9xsz,t1_fcu13vx,1577976040.0,"While I kinda get the sentiment, a lot of CPR instructors take these courses pretty seriously.  I get certified for work every 2 years and the courses do lend themselves to goofing around and cracking jokes but you're literally learning a skill that could make the difference in a friend or coworker making it home to their family or not.  If this was a class with a bunch of first time students, I'm kind of on the side of the instructor who's making sure they learn how to do this right."
washingtondc,fcm12c2,t1_fckrf5y,1577761458.0,Agreed.  It definitely was not affordable enough for people on a budget
washingtondc,fckm0pi,t1_fckgw8k,1577728248.0,Went a few years ago.  It was well worth the price of admission but I went mainly on the high recommendation from my sister.  I could see how many people would not want to spend $25 without knowing exactly what they would be getting
gifs,fckdzru,t3_ehkipa,1577723202.0,The fact that the slomo starts AFTER she puts all the candles out bothers me way more than it should
sports,fck2v00,t1_fck11t5,1577714933.0,What?  It literally shows that Man U won their last game.  Man City had to win their game to win the title if Man U won their game.   As I recall. people thought that Man City would beat QPR pretty easily as they weren't a huge competitor at the time but Man City ended up going down 2-1 pretty late in the game.  They managed to score 2 goals very late to come back and win the game and the title.
sports,fcjaz95,t1_fcjacek,1577681749.0,"It's mainly the fact that you have a significant amount of action that could sway the game in either team's direction all in the span of less than a minute.  A penalty in extra time (dramatic moment in any game), the PK taker misses (usually the odds are in their favor), goalkeeper makes not one but two saves (a rare and impressive feat) to keep his team alive, and then a very quick counter attack to score a goal to win for the other team with essentially the last kick of regular time.  Even in a normal everyday league game this would be super exciting but the fact that it's a tournament semifinal adds some gravitas."
todayilearned,fcf88ry,t1_fcbz79y,1577627455.0,"I have a family member who is a big history buff and has a lot of collectibles.  I was visiting his house one time and he showed me a small leather bound, handwritten journal that belonged to some long-dead great great uncle/grandfather that was related to us. The text didn't look like much (names, dates, numbers) until he told me that it was a ledger that catalogued the rental of his slaves to other people.  It was weird how something so commonplace became very uncomfortable to hold in my hands and a sobering reminder that this time period wasn't all that long ago.  Im glad to see how far we've come but we've still got so far to go."
freefolk,fcaanxc,t1_fc8hkzs,1577565726.0,Proper top tier shitpost.  A nice change from the nonstop shitting on D&D and season 8 that has kind of made me hate what this sub turned into

tennis,fc9gv01,t1_fc8hxcy,1577552484.0,"Ronaldo also has 2 years on Messi so I think we'll have to wait until they're both retired to really compare.  Messi's got one more balon d'or now too.

And having a piece of shit like Ramos to injure key players in CL final doesn't hurt their chances either."

AskCulinary,fc4adsm,t1_fc3otlw,1577410982.0,"Surprised I had to scroll this far.  He's not an amazing cook but his recipes and tips really appeal to the normal everyday cook (quick, designed for good leftovers and less dishes to clean).  They're also really delicious.  My favorites are his chicken parm and bolognese"
