It's supposed to be a thing where your SO or the Dom treats you like a little kid again and makes you feel like a little kid again. Most people who are into this have daddy issues. They want to feel loved again. Possibly love they were denied as a child. Or maybe they were denied a childhood.

There's nothing wrong with wanting to be a kid again.

Some people take that shit to the bedroom. And I'd rather not. Personally that makes it weird. Like You aren't physically 6 or 7 but you act like a 6 or 7yo. And that's a nope. 

Also come at me I used to be into this. Oddly enough I stopped after my dad and I repaired our relationship. For me it wasn't sexual. I just enjoyed being a kid again. Consequently I was at a really rough time where the current weights and situations of being in highschool were getting to me and I just wanted to be a kid again.

So like the rules state. No kink shaming. You don't like it fine. But don't hate on what another person likes. That's their weird buisness. As long as they keep it away from other people. Which this guy obviously didn't do."

skyrim,fdu9hfa,t1_fdu2t0l,1578729895.0,I gave Maven blackbriar a whompin while I was in werewolf mode. And I forgot I was with the theives guild. And when I entered the flaggon nobody would talk to me. All they told me was that Brynjolf wanted to talk to me and that I messed up. I was legit kinda sad.
