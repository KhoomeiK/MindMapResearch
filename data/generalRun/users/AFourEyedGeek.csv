You can see FIFA 14 still displayed at 480p. I think it is marvelous developers still supported such an old console. 1080p output without modding is not something the PS2 could do, 1080i was the highest resolution it could display at, but games were rendering internally at 480p or 480i. Some games ran at 240p on the PS2, but many of them were collections of older games.

I would love the PS5 to support their older games on the new system like XBox One does for their old games, not just the PS4 games, but the PS1 and PS2 games, and then it upscales them. That would be nice, but I don't think they will for PS3 or older games."
