CFL,ffip3pu,t1_ffim9ea,1579979208.0,"Nichols damn near won last year's west final if not for Darvin Adams dropping a TD pass that hit him in the hands, and Streveler overthrowing Harris on the trick play.  He's also played at least one playoff game with an injury.

Nichols has won twice as many games as he has lost for the Bombers and doesn't get nearly enough credit."

It was when Tim's dropped their blending and roasting contractor and built their own plant.  McDonald's swooped in and grabbed the blending and roasting contractor, after sourcing their own beans from the same regions as Tim's.  It is believed that the contractor gave McDonald's the secret blend (or close enough to avoid lawsuits), which is why McDonald's coffee tastes a lot like Tim's used to."
