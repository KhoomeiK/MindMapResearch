povertyfinance,fensqwm,t3_eq3ptj,1579290166.0,"Here's the thing. No one is a fountain of knowledge. Not everyone researches everything they do. Not everyone is surrounded by knowledgeable people. There is no life manual to every aspect of it. There is no procedure for all resources, or what are essential steps for all and any given situation.

Often also, when you've never had to struggle for every penny, you have no idea. Or sometimes even if you have, not everyone thinks alike.


I'm a person who literally knows where every dollar goes. I literally have to consider every item I spend money on, down to daily, weekly monthly and yearly. Basically I have a spreadsheet with all my payments and expenses planned out a year in advance. Because I have no resources, no family to ask for help. Every move I make I have to know what I'm doing because there is no undo or easy way out for me.

The internet is a global resource that could essentially help a lot of people do things better and more efficiently and save people time and money. But even then, it is a mismatch of misinformation. People may have to use their own judgment to evaluate what information they find.

It would be great if everyone had access to only great helpful accurate cheap and reliable information for everything."

Save for your emergency fund. Save separately as if it's a bill.
