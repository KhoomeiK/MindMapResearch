I’m a D2 beta vet, and I do pretty much everything but raids (mostly due to lack of group and time). My Steam/IGN is ‘ItHasBegun’.

Here’s the note I wrote myself about it:

Some RNG Math For Armor:

out of 8 total slots, 4 can roll with armor stats
=1 out of 2 drops will have stats

*assume* 60+ stat rolls have a 1% drop rate
=1 out of 200 drops will roll 60+

with 3 elemental affinities
=1 out of 600 drops will roll 60+ w/correct element

your preferred highest stat
=1 out of 3600 drops will roll 60+ w/correct element & correct highest stat

your preferred 2nd highest stat
=1 out of 18,000 drops will roll 60+ w/correct element & correct highest 2 stats!!!"
