I'm pretty sure C++ devs prefer Java's garbage collection than working with pointers lol

However, I think understanding what a pointer is and the difference between the stack and heap can help to understand how to work with a language. For example, Java is pass by value right? So if I pass an ArrayList as an argument it should take the value of the ArrayList and make a new ArrayList with the same values right? Well no, because ArrayLists in Java are stored as references. For someone who doesn't really understand pointers, it can be confusing that if you pass an int as an argument and change its value it won't affect the original int, but if you add an element in an ArrayList passed as an argument it will change the original.

With Java, the JVM just takes care of that work for you. I've had to write if statements checking on what OS we are on with C++ because I had to make different sys calls. 

Actual C++ code isn't that difficult in my eyes. I think schools should still use C++ as a first language because learning pointers is quite useful when you are trying to understand if the ArrayList you are passing as an argument in Java is a reference or is a copy."

Most people who do good on Leetcode interviews already know the solution or have done a similar problem. I've done more than 250 problems on Leetcode and through most of the interviews I had that had a Leetcode question, I just remembered the solution and solved it that way. Thinking that candidates can solve a new Leetcode hard question with the added pressure of an interview is insane."

csMajors,fdevzar,t3_ekylv2,1578347744.0,"You can only do the best you can do. A lot of what happens is out of your control. The problem with big companies is that they don't have one interviewer for all the candidates for a position. They pick some random software engineers to interview you and they give feedback based on your performance only. This is incredibly subjective. Someone could not be experienced and think you did amazing or someone could have unrealistic expectations and think you did terribly. They just fill a little form after the interview and then the recruiter picks the ones that have the best feedback.

In my case, I was really ready for the interview and spent 6 months non-stop doing everything to be ready. Once I got to the interview, my interviewer told me it was the first time he was doing an interview and had trouble with the platform. The real problem is that his English was terrible. I can deal with a thick accent, but he had poor understanding and speaking skills. He couldn't understand my answers and he was incoherent in the way he was speaking. This lead him to keep changing the requirements for the bizarre system design question he gave me. Anyways, he seemed to be very confused throughout the interview. I didn't get any offers.

Now, my good friend was asked a ridiculously easy question and had a chat about some of his previous projects and was hired.

Amazon can do their best to try to have standardized interviews, but it doesn't work well when you get interviewed by people who don't do it often. They aren't specially trained to give interviews.

The best you can do is try your best. You can be lucky or unlucky. The best tip I can give you, and this applies to all jobs, is to be chill and not stressed in the interview. If you are stressed out, your personality will seem worst and will leave a bad impression."

malefashionadvice,fdc7dys,t3_ekfnxd,1578268555.0,"For those who buy clothes online, how much is too many returns?

I've never bought clothes online, but when I go in person, I often don't really like the fit of the piece of clothing I'm trying on and end up not buying anything. Sometimes the cut just doesn't fit my proportions. I've seen many people online say they return most of what they order because it doesn't fit. Some say they return more than half of what they buy.

Although most place I see online offer unlimited returns policy, I still feel like a fraud returning items. Is it acceptable to buy a lot of clothes and return many?"

loseit,fdc1enc,t1_fd75f8z,1578265225.0,"Gyms make money off people who don't come. If someone comes everyday, he isn't bringing value to the gym. 90% of people stop going to the gym after a few months. The gym earns money off these people who pay for a service they don't use. If all of these people didn't quit and came every day, they gym would be way too crowded. Also, big tough guys who are mean to new members are also scary for people who might want a membership. If someone who just wants to check the gym comes and sees a gym full of people groaning and making fun of a small skimpy dude, they might be intimidated and won't come. 

For that reason, the new year resolutioners who stop showing up are how gyms make money. They love these people who don't keep their commitments. 

There's a reason why planet fitness is making so much money, it's because their target market is the new year resolutioners. They don't want heavy lifters and intimidating people. Most gyms will have no problem banning active members if they become a nuisance."

I wonder if they make you sign some papers for liability before the ride, including giving consent to allowing the park to do as they wish with the footage. If I remember, most of these slingshot rides require you to pay an extra fee when you want to do that ride. I wouldn't be surprised if most people signed away their videos to us without knowing it. I'd be pretty surprised if people actually gave consent after freaking out to share the video. I can only imagine this poor guy getting of the ride after being tricked by the operator, and then being asked by the same operator who just scared the shit out of him if he could post that video online."

If you see an empty patch on someone's face, it's because there isn't any hair that grows in that area. There isn't any follicle existing there, hence no hair will grow.

Fast food places have this bullshit rule that you need to shave because hair could fall in food, which is insane considering my arm hair is 20 times longer than stubble. The military and some LEOs have to shave just because ""it looks more professionnal"", which is also a bs reason."

My lifting routine is a 6 day A/B split, so on the 7th day I just go sit on a spinning bike and sweat my ass off.

malegrooming,fd3zvly,t3_ek04q9,1578163087.0,"Your problem is not that you need more time to grow your facial hair, the problem is that you don't have enough. No matter how long you wait, it won't look good. I don't know how old you are, but if you are younger than 20, you could get a less patchy beard over years. If you're over 20, then you're pretty much stuck with what you have.

Now, not having too much facial hair is a blessing. You can probably shave without irritation and not as often as others. I would embrace the clean-shaven look if I were you. There's no way you're going to grow an acceptable beard with what you are dealing with."
