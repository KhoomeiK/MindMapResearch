usajobs,ffk0ips,t1_ffjwzhh,1580012089.0,"The Microsoft Home Use Program and Antivirus are no longer offered. Microsoft will no longer offer Office as a standalone license, Office 2019 was the last. You will need to subscribe to Office365 at $99.95 a year. The AV licenses were dropped because the cost, and because Microsoft Security tools and Windows Defender along with patching have become better then most third party AV like McAfee. Sorry :("

usajobs,fct89pd,t1_fct7e4a,1577935505.0,"Hmm. I think it is 5 now, but that might be for TS. I just hired a guy, he moved from the VA with no clearance, retired Army. He had worked there over years, came to me and we activated his old clearance and indocked him for SCI in under a week. But he was signal corp in the Army with a TS there. I still think it is 5 though. I've had people got to DOE though and they didn't take the DoD clearances. So... I have a friend that works for DSS. I'll ask him."
