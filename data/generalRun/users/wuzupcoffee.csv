I’d make the same argument for most marine life, many large predators, and intelligent primates.

That said, I’m not completely anti-zoo. I do think that some breeding programs have helped save some species, and some animals adapt well to a zoo environment. Exposure to happy healthy animals in zoos can help raise awareness for people and foster a love for nature."
