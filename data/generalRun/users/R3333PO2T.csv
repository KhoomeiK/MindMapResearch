Overwatch,fghzcok,t3_eyko7i,1580798840.0,"Depends what hero, I don’t use aim assist.

I play with linear plane (Aim smoothing 0) on all hero’s, for my most played hero which right now is a tie between hanzo and widow. My hanzo sens is 80/70 and 10 or 15 aim ease in and my widow is 80/75 with 10/15 aim ease and 40 relative scope sens.

Genji is my third most played and I have 0 or 5 aim  ease in and 90/85 sens or 100/100

Tanks and supports are all set around the same at either 60/60 or 80/80. Except for Ana which has the same settings as widow.

I play most hero’s at high sens and balance them out add a small bit of aim ease-in to make it feel more comfy. it takes me a few games to get used to it and get consistent once I get the right settings."
