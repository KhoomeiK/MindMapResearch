I think the worst thing about him for me is that his character undergoes so much transformation, and yet shows so little emotional growth. Could just be bad acting, I don't know. But after about the third season he just started to really piss me off."

My course typically starts around the beginning of the Ottoman Empire (1299) but I do a little bit of intro as far back as the 7th century with early Islam.

lawofattraction,ffab21y,t3_eshu70,1579731401.0,"The point is that you attract what you think about, regardless of whether you want it or not. If you say ""I want to be successful,"" you may be thinking about it from a place of anxiety, meaning you're constantly thinking about fear of failure. This means that you're thinking about failure. But if you think about your success with a mindset oriented toward confidence, your subconscious mind is focused on positive results. Similarly, if you anxiously think to yourself, ""I don't want to be late,"" you're thinking about being late so you're more likely to attract obstacles that make you late. But if you think the same thing from a confident perspective of ""I am always punctual,"" you're more likely to be punctual."

Professors,feorvp2,t3_eq6g3d,1579304577.0,"I've had some similar experiences, and one way I like to respond to controversial opinions is to say, ""That's an interesting thought. Who would like to respond?"" and that way the other students know that they are free to do so whether they agree or disagree. I've also had students say things similar to your student's comment about deaf culture, and I would respond with something like ""Actually, I was surprised to learn about XYZ too! But it is a real thing (then insert some details), isn't that interesting?"" -- this lets the student know it's ok that he didn't know about it before and that even we as professors are always learning."

Messiah,feds2nj,t1_fedce7p,1579018682.0,"I agree the ""strong career woman"" trope has gotten pretty boilerplate, but I think that Eva's voice (the most skeptical one, IMO) is what keeps the balance for audiences to wonder about. I just finished the season and I still can't figure out if PG is ""real"" or not because Eva was so convinced he's not. Although by the end, even Felix seems unconvinced, and the only person we see maybe starting to believe (plot twist!) is Avi."

Messiah,fe93p95,t1_fe91oz7,1578933814.0,"The way I describe Farsi compared to Arabic is that in most of the Arab world, vowels ""lean backwards in the mouth"" whereas in Farsi, the vowels ""stand straight up."" I know there are more linguistically sophisticated ways of describing this, but that's kind of what it sounds like to me lol. Like Persian vowels have a lot less ""room"" in the mouth and are produced more in the front of the mouth. They're both beautiful languages! As for the silent Qahf, I am certain I have heard some Arabs pronounce it that way. I just have to do more research! It may be a Maghrebi thing (and even then, a small regional thing within the Maghreb). I didn't notice the Hebrew accent! I actually was thinking to myself that Avi's Arabic is really good lol but I haven't spent a lot of time listening to Hebrew speakers so that's something I'll have to look more into!"
lawofattraction,fe923qr,t3_eo54u7,1578933314.0,"I was actually just reading about how the brain ""doesn't know the difference"" between real and imagined happiness, and so just imagining something happy can actually increase serotonin production (which I think is the literal definition of LOA at work -- our thoughts literally creating a measurable chemical change!). I've been thinking about this concept as well and I think that in moderation, it's ok to use substances to help us along. I'm not saying we should all go out and do a bunch of coke lol but I mean it stands to reason that if your brain is optimally regulated, you will have an easier time manifesting. If you have a chemical imbalance or psychiatric issue that can be mediated by medication, treating that imbalance under appropriate medical supervision could improve both your general health and your brain's creative power. 

I find that stimulants don't help me manifest, but certain other things (like a little glass of wine in the evening -- not getting drunk, just a bit more relaxed) really help me with manifestation. Also a little bit of sugar in moderation to stimulate dopamine. Not an entire cake, just maybe one or two pieces of candy lol. I find that I manifest most effectively when my mind is in a state of calm that I can effectively produce with these things. My favorite supplement to calm me down is L-Theanine. I take two (for a total of 400 mg) whenever I feel anxiety coming on and it REALLY calms me down without giving me any bad side-effects. I also tried a supplement called 5-HTP but that just made me jittery and anxious. YMMV though -- a lot of people really like that one. r/Nootropics might also have some helpful information on this topic, though they don't really discuss LOA as far as I know."
Messiah,fe8wwvj,t3_enzrs9,1578931958.0,"I have been thinking about this a lot too! I don't know Hebrew but I have enough of a command of Arabic that a lot of the dialect nuances stood out to me. In the very first episode when al-Masih was speaking, I thought to myself, ""Why is this guy speaking Arabic with a Persian accent? Bad casting!"" but then Eva said he was probably a Shi'a from Iran and I was like ""ohhh ok yeah."" But was it just me, or did his Persian accent significantly decrease as the series went on? It sounded to me like his Arabic became more and more Levantine-sounding with each episode. Also, was there a moment in one of the later episodes where Jibril's teacher called him ""Gibril""? Like with Maghrebi pronunciation? Maybe I just misheard it? Also one of the teachers (I can't remember if it was Jibril's or Samer's) seemed to pronounce the ""Q"" character (ie ""Qalb"") silently -- I can't remember which regional dialect does that (I've heard some Egyptian people do it) but it stood out to me. 

Of course, part of me was thinking we also hear a number of American-English dialects just because of the regional differences (ie Texans vs people from DC Metro) with no underlying themes there. So I don't want to read *too* too much into it haha. Anyway, glad to see this thread! What do you think, OP and others?"

lawofattraction,fdttwrt,t3_emtalf,1578722140.0,"I've actually had this experience, and I think the trick is in how you mold your mind to your manifestation. In cases where I've wanted to manifest something and I constantly thought about it in a state of ""Oh wouldn't it be so wonderful if..."" I've found that it never works out. However, if I just briefly and casually (not intensely at all!) think about it as ""Oh yeah, when that happens..."" it almost always comes to fruition. I'm not sure how to account for it, honestly, but it's an observation I've noticed is surprisingly consistent."

I'd had them for YEARS, and then one day I just decided I was not going to live the rest of my life with them. Within a month or so, they were gone. I also find that I can generally eat whatever I want without gaining weight as long as I tell myself, ""These calories don't count."" At first it started just as a joke, but then I started noticing a startling truth to it. To test the theory, I started to tell myself to notice all the calories I was eating and sure enough, I gained weight. Nothing changed about my diet, just my thinking. (To clarify, my diet is relatively healthy to begin with, and there isn't too much variation in the amount of calories I eat, but there was definitely a noticeable difference in my weight when I was ""refusing"" to gain weight. Though I wouldn't recommend this as a weight loss method without proper diet and exercise! More of just a ""thinking supplement"" to a healthy weight loss process.)"

That's the #1 thing you can do to show the universe that you deserve better. It will respond by bringing you all the good that you just told it you deserve. You just *demanded* that the universe give you better, and whether ""better"" comes in the form of this relationship or another one, it will deliver. 

You also did right by your ex and by the 3P (even if you don't necessarily like her, she's still a person and deserves to be in a relationship with someone who values her enough to not be ""heartbroken"" by someone else, ie you!). Enjoy New Year's Eve knowing that you did the right thing for all involved, most of all yourself. I admire your strength, resolve, and commitment to *demanding* the best for yourself!

I also don't want to discourage you from moving on, though, because the universe may be trying to tell you that you have to be ok on your own before you can be the best partner you can be for her (or perhaps for someone better). My advice: let go, trust the universe and the law, and things will suddenly turn around. I have had this experience, and what I remember most strongly is that I had to completely let go before my manifestation came into being (and when it finally did, it was effing epic!).
