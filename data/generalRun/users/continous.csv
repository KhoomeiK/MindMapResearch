Our conversation was rather one-sided and petty from you. I asked why it did not work like Morrowind. You stated that Morrowind's functionality was OP and broken, I stated that while that may be true it may be what people are expecting or like. I proceeded to ask how I would go about making the necessary changes. You then insulted me and told me to just do it myself.

You're no more helpful than the crappy comment section you complain about. I literally wanted to make a patch to solve what I saw as a shortcoming in your mod, a minor modification, that would make it more in-line with what I wanted. And you effectively told me to go figure it out on my own, with 0 direction. I'm not asking you to coddle me, but your mod doesn't exactly have a ton of useful comments in it to help direct me.

The issue is that it does more than increase accessibility. Again, by what logic is increasing the selection cap not also applicable to increasing the food cap or the upkeep caps. These all make the game less accessible. What about better pathfinding?

So let me get this straight; since some people in the comments section of Nexusmods were getting uppity you decided to take your mods down from Nexus mods? That's pretty petty and about as ridiculous as the comments themselves imo.

To use the usual analogy, you don't like how everyone else is playing with your toys, so you take the toys and leave. Now no one gets to have fun with your toys but you.

I'm not saying you should just endure the abuse people are sending towards you, but I am saying it's not much more friendly of you to take your toys and leave.

>So I decided to transfer a bunch of mods to the Caretaker and temporarily hide them so the comments stop piling up while I get in touch with Nexus staff, because I'm pretty sure disabling comments deletes the entire comment thread.

Perhaps it would have been a better idea to mute your comments. Can you even do that? You should be able to imo.

>I didn't say I was transferring them to the Caretaker though, so before I could do anything else, my inbox exploded and I was told to kill myself.

Welcome to the internet. It's not nice, or okay, but there is absolutely nothing we can do to mitigate this. People will always be absolute assholes. I get told to go fuck myself, and have been told I should just curl over and die at work multiple times this year already. It sucks, and you don't even get paid. But that's life unfortunately.

>To clarify, I won't permanently delete my mods. They have open permissions, so it's not like I even could. When I hide a mod, it's because I'm doing something. Sorry for not announcing what exactly I was doing, though I did learn something about this community, I guess.

Through your interactions here, and on the Nexus I've found that you're very antagonistic towards the community, and while it's not entirely unwarranted, it certainly doesn't help your situation. Being so cynical and jaded is not good, and will just make people like you less. If you don't like having to deal with the community fine, but to reiterate, taking your toys and leaving is not okay, give it to the caretaker, disable your account, and move on. It's not worth it to get into some long-winded battle with the community.

I really don't like the attitude from either side of the community when it comes to mods, permissions, and what can/should be done with an author's mods. Mod authors, almost universally, have this holier than thou, antagonistic and rude attitude towards the community, even going so far as to repeatedly state ""I know better than you, shut up"" or some variant thereof, and the community treats the mod authors as their personal work horses, whose only purposes is to grind out mods and mod improvements.

It's unhealthy and both sides need to fucking stop. It's not some personal slight against you when a commenter asks if you'll implement X ridiculous feature. And it's not okay to respond to a mod author removing his mods with fucking death threats. Like what the fuck guys."

It's not that simple, and you know it. Easily coordinating more than 12 units is far more than just keystroke reduction.

I don't want to go down this rabbit hole quite frankly, but you don't know the exact equipment they're using or the camera. You cannot say with certainty that the two cameras used in these photoshoots do not have different necessary timings for the exposure setting necessary for the images taken. Not all equipment is made equal, and we do not know the production value or difference thereof. I'll leave it there.

>The model is not perfectly still between shots, meaning that a slow exposure will be blurred.

Directly in relation to the shutter setting. You don't need an insanely low shutter speed to mitigate motion blur. It can be done with a fairly low shutter speed especially with good lighting.

>If they are going for intentionality blurring for effect, then the movement is deliberate, but the model in this is merely wobbling like a regular person.

They could have been attempting to go for a larger depth of field, which may require a narrower aperture, and thus a longer shutter exposure.

>The entire map itself breathes a day and night cycle, which drastically effects everything

This is true; however, a day/night cycle isn't exactly a huge strategic thing compared to some other features seen in other series not seen in Warcraft 3 even at the time. It's hardly ""ahead of its time"" either as most modern RTS don't make notable difference between day and night, if at all having such a cycle.

>Summoned units. Otherwise deemed the annoying ""Free units"" of other games *cough* SC2 *cough* Are still a risk vs reward in many cases.

Summoned units were not new by this point. Command and Conquer Generals, which had released around the same time, had free units as well in the form of commander powers. The game only released a year after Reign of Chaos, making it basically impossible that it was made in response to it, or that any of the core features; like commander power, were influenced by Warcraft 3. Empire Earth and Civilization also had free units, though not in the form of summons, by this point as well. Age of Empires had units that were semi-free in the form of shipments(?).

Now, I'm not saying that Warcraft 3 was very forward thinking for it's time. It absolutely was. But it's no Starcraft. Warcraft 3 was short sighted in a few ways. For one; the engine was designed such that higher unit counts actually breaks the pathfinding. And ""higher"" can be reached in a large FFA melee game even.

The hero unit is very amazing for it's time, but lacked some development I think it deserved. It would have been nice to see more Hero to basic unit synergy abilities like trueshot aura. Perhaps some opening hero traits.

They entirely dropped Naga as a race, when it would've made TFT an even better expansion to have a new race added.

But most of all; Warcraft's visuals, though stylized enough to age better than the rest, were actually fairly dated at the time. Keep in mind, in this same year Age of Mythology, Army Men: RTS (it's not that bad, I swear!), and Medieval: Total War all released in the same year. Warcraft 3 went for a stylistic approach so looked aesthetically better, but the other big RTS releases around this time were far more graphically impressive in my opinion. Especially if you look 1 to 2 years ahead, when TFT is released.

***

But Warcraft 3 ***was*** forward looking in it's many gameplay decisions. It focused on tactical gameplay, making it far more interesting to non-veterans of the RTS genre as well as more accessible. This focus also increased the viewability of the game as an esport; it's simply more exciting to see high-stakes tactical battles, than drawn out battles of economy.

Warcraft 3 also heavily focused on a hybrid game approach. A slightly RPG-esque hero system, with upgrades and items that target specific units attributes rather than just being direct dmg hp or range buffs was very unique and new for the time.

Unit energy was still pretty unique for the time, but even more so was the many unique factions with very few direct counterpart units. The Footman is unique from the Ghoul is unique from the Archer. This sort of uniqueness is not seen in other games even to this day, except for a very select few units, which is quite forward-looking.

Creeping is rather interesting, but not forward-looking imo, as it is simply a way to facilitate the hero mechanic. However, having creeps at your expansion as a method of delaying fast expands is really forward-thinking when looking at today's RTS games.

Most interesting, in my opinion, was Blizzards' treatment of the campaign. Warcraft 3's campaign is perhaps the most revolutionary part of it, touching on extremely sensitive subjects and addressing deep lore and an intertwined story. This was revolutionary for the time."

""the right thing"" is not clear. Giving housing away doesn't help most homeless people. Further, it isn't coercing the rich, it's coercing developers and investors which are often time businesses not people. Businesses, since they're not people, have no moral incentive to do the good or bad thing, but only to do what is profitable. Making apartments more profitable is an easy way to incentivize development in those areas. Raising taxes doesn't solve the problem, it just results in capital flight, as you could see in places like Detroit and Chicago. Raising taxes isn't helping them.

Demand is still insanely high, and the market is still extremely healthy, as can be indicated within the same article;

""In the fourth quarter, the median price for an apartment in New York City ***fell below $1 million for the first time in three years.***""

The median price is still vastly above what any impoverished citizen could ever afford. When we're discussing rents within shouting distance of one million dollars, my point is made for me.

Yes; but you expressly were implying that previous recorded sold prices are irrelevant as they could change tomorrow, but I directly challenge that by stating that the price offered today could be over-inflated.

Again; which is why previously sold prices are the only reliable way to measure market value.

>That's something that has always been true, and always will be true for some part of the local population. 

Yes, but the point is that it is true to an excessive degree atm in these cities. US cities have downright broken mass transit systems; especially when compared to cities across the globe.

>One of the factors that makes the elite the elite is that they have the means to have what they want.

That's not the driving factor though. The driving factor is likely being born to a functioning family, and having the discipline to become good enough at a job or skill to become highly paid. A bit of luck and birthright function into it, but not by a lot.

That's been my point since the beginning. My point has been the housing in inner cities have never been affordable, except in extreme cases, to the lower rungs of society. The solution modern societies have come up with is to both build higher density housing, and to provide greater access to the city from without the city.

This simply isn't true, and it's far more complex than you make it out to be. Within the state of California it is more profitable to rent out a single-family home because of the various taxes associated with renting a large apartment. It's also far easier to maintain a home than an apartment complex, yet the California state gives essentially 0 subsidies for maintaining an apartment complex over a house.

There are ways to incentivize apartments over houses; but states like California would sooner spite the rich instead, like you would have them. It's not conducive to society to attack the upper class out of spite than it is for the upper class to hold the lower class in contempt.

todayilearned,ff5nvdj,t1_ff5bm8d,1579602355.0,">The idea that there are any places anywhere that always have more demand than supply of real estate is just not true. 

Who said always? But, no there are many cases of this, at least within a generation and within a reasonably sized area. You can see this in many popular harbors like New York, London, and Tokyo. The demand remains very high over a long period of time, in spite of the supply remaining rather low for the same period of time. Even in Tokyo they attempted to solve this issue with things like capsule hotels, but they don't truly fix the problem. The city remains a high-cost area because too many people want to live within the city to justify selling at a price affordable to lower income buyers. It's the simple fact of the matter that you want to sell your property for as much as the market will bear, and the market will bear more as demand rises, especially when it comes to demand driven not largely from lower pricing tiers.

That's one of the other big issues. Within a big city, a buyer must compete with higher earner tiers. This offsets the pricing significantly, as opposed to when you look at slums, where no one of the higher wager tiers wants to settle for, where the pricing remains low, but you also have lower quality real estate now.

It's far more complex than just giving people housing, and we can demonstrate this with the failed state of the projects.

>The market is measured by average prices for comps, but those figures only reflect a market that was;

Unless you're suggesting the pricing of these cities is dropping, it is only conducive to my point that the pricing is a past measurement. It is sure to have increased since measured.

>the price you can actually get is the one true, real, actual market price for that particular property on a particular day.

That's not true, since you could theoretically skew the market price by putting your real estate on the market for an unrealistically high or low price, and have someone buy it. In reality, that's not likely to happen, which is exactly why we use past pricing. But even ignoring that, we could use currently offered rates instead of last sold rates, and I'd still be correct in my assessment.

>If your family could afford to live in a nice house in a small town that had a factory, because your dad was the general manager of that factory, but then the factory went away, then the demand for that nice house might have gone away with it.

These are cities, it is extremely rare for them to so change. Detroit and Chicago are the only two examples of such large cities having had that happen to them in the US's history. Most of the time these sort of transitions happen over a long period of time, giving a chance for real estate flight. Further, you're making a suggestion that these cities *will* fail, but we have no reason to believe that. We also have no reason to believe that such a significant drop in value and price would even solve the homelessness problem. Chicago and Detroit both still have a relatively large homelessness population anyways; and their inner city districts are still disproportionately priced relative to the surrounding districts enough to still be inaccessible to the poor and disadvantaged.

I am explicitly not discussing small towns because small towns tend to already be rather affordable even when accounting for an increased rate of demand over the average.

 The fact of the matter is, homeless people within the city are not seeking homes, and that is obvious by the fact that no affordable homes are there. They congregate within cities for support structures during the day, like public areas, free food, free drinks, restrooms, showers, and even handouts from panhandling. These are just innocent reasons I know of. There are of course less innocent reasons like access to drugs.

I think we're addressing different issues. You're addressing the economic issue of inflated housing prices. There's no easy way to deal with that imo. I'm discussing the issue of housing prices being outside the reach of the local population.

The issue is that they often do. They just can't get to the place that would be affordable.

I'll give an example of how these sorts of programs are often well-meaning but broken. In California (I cannot speak for other states) the standards necessary for a landlord to rent to Section 8 renters is higher than that of normal renters. This, instead of incentivizing a landlord to rent to section 8 tenants as you'd imagine, often makes it a financial loss to house section 8 tenants in spite of the subsidy, and also makes it such that only slum lords that seek a consistent payment rather than a profitable enterprise would house these tenants. I know because I've personally assisted turning one of the slum apartments around on the behalf of a landlord, and the fact of the matter is, the section 8 tenants were a relative loss for no good reason.

Just giving people things is not a solution. Group homes, and shelters are the solutions to your problem of inconsistency. But homeless people regular refuse these solutions. Perhaps even with good reason, such as these places being seedy locations...but that just proves my point that the homeless situation is far more than just not having houses or apartments to get these people in."

I don't believe this is necessarily an issue as it is not entirely easy to tell why wealth is not growing evenly throughout the population. It may simply be a matter of the population being more willing to share wealth. I think it's more likely in today's day and age for someone to be either living with a large collection of people under one roof, or by themselves, as opposed to a few decades ago where you either lived with only your immediate family, or yourself, necessitating a larger per person wealth on average.

Further, there's the question of whether the wealth need grow so fast. While cost of living in many ways has risen, it may not have universally.

The bottom line is I do not have the full array of information to truly state that the population growing quicker than the average wealth is actually a problem.

This is a problem; but I don't think it's a problem to be owed to the rich. The poor must be expected to take responsibility for their actions or fail, as should the rich. Just as a rich kid squandering his family's fortune should not be given it back because ""well he didn't know better.""

The real estate market crash is not relevant to today's homelessness crisis, and that is evident by the fact that the houses were subsequently sold at a loss in a majority of cases. Not to mention, most people who are homeless would have never been the buyer of a house, but more than likely a rentee of an apartment, condo, or house; in which case they would have been left relatively unaffected as far as housing is concerned.

>Also on the downtown part we have a shiiiiittt ton of square footage that goes unused for all but 40-50 hours a week.

Just because something goes unused for all of 40-50 hours a week does not mean it is that percentage useless for the entire week. We could also turn roads into shanty towns at night, but that's a public hazard, and the roads are needed for the ***potential*** of travel, not just the act in and of itself. In addition; the inverse argument can be made against houses. Most people leave their home unoccupied for 40 hours or more a week, by this logic, should we require people rent their home to others during their work hours?

Telecommuting and computer-based work are not perfect replacements for actual workers in an office.
