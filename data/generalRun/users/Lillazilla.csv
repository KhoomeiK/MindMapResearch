hmmm,ffgjir0,t3_etgrr3,1579907679.0,My dumbass thought she created a whole ass computer model and somehow blended her head behind it. I was very confused until I saw part of the moniter.
AskReddit,ff7sjf8,t1_ff6ml72,1579657314.0,When the robber saw my naked father running towards him he just ran out the door. I guess it depends how insane the naked person looks because this was in the early 2000's when my dad had dreads and was on drugs.
memes,feroy48,t1_feq3etw,1579356671.0,Well obviously but they cant hurt a dog like that and not get punished some way or another or they'll be the next Ted Bundy. I care more about dogs than humans anyways so I think the human should experience some form of punishment instead of the doggo being the only one to get hurt.
memes,fepmayg,t1_feoyzmv,1579324270.0,They need a serious punishment or they'll do something even worse as adults. Disgusting.
Crushes,feplz5z,t1_fepai0h,1579324013.0,Man I want to believe that but that sounds like a fairy tale.
Crushes,feplwp4,t3_eq7zjv,1579323960.0,"If that Greek God doesnt like you for you fuck that asshole. Nothing is worse than a vain motherfucker and if he cant love you for you and cant get past your ""looks"" which you seem are bad but I have a similar body type to you, my shoulders are broad and I have extra fat in my upper arms, back, I have a weird muffin top, and my tummy has some fat, but then my butt and thighs and legs are small compared to my torso, the only downside is my boobs are small. But whatever, we're still beautiful bitch!"
SuicideWatch,feo8e2x,t1_femsclq,1579296510.0,The optimistic people who dont think about the negative things have a false sense of reality. They see the world through rose tinted glasses.
SuicideWatch,feo86nc,t1_femgis1,1579296387.0,I used to have a passion and now I cant do it anymore and it frustrates me. Art used to make me happy and all I can do is stare at the paper and i end up trashing anything I do.
memes,feo56wt,t1_fembpqz,1579295287.0,"I dont understand why people downvoted your reply. The only reason people day that optimistic shit is to make themselves feel better about themselves because they think they're helping people when a suicidal person could care less, and all they want is attention and praise and circle jerking. It's fucking annoying and ruined my night even more because I was distracting myself by looking at shitty memes and that guilt tripping shit game up and made me feel even more suicidal."
memes,fenzupw,t1_femc5je,1579293162.0,"I dont know how that could save somebody though. It triggered my suicidal thoughts instead of helping because I was distracting myself by looking at memes and this shit reminds me and makes me feel guilty and selfish and reminds me that I do want to die. People look on r/memes for memes to cheer them up, atleast some people do, and I dont see how it could help when it sounds like exactly what selfish people just trying to feel good about themself sound like. If I wanted to see a meme telling me that suicide isn't the answer and is wrong I'd go on a subreddit meant for that if it does exist, but it's not even funny or wholesome. It ruined my night and I know I sound pissy but it's true. Optimists are the worst especially when they dont even know how suicidal people think. Sometimes there isnt a better way out. What if somebody has a terminal illness or have been getting help all their life and it hasn't worked? What if somebody doesnt have anybody in their life at all? If the people in their life are abusive and have caused PTSD or neglectful of their mental illness or they live in a country that isnt as educated on mental illness? You cant just say that optimistic bull shit to everybody, sometimes they have an actual reason and they're in a lot of pain that'll last a lifetime."
memes,fem50jp,t3_epv5h9,1579239978.0,Look at r/suicidewatch most of these dont work for some people on there who have no one left and have been getting help for years.
SuicideWatch,fem3tko,t3_ept7vg,1579238827.0,"I think about this a lot and it hurts even more when I'm suicidal or planning. My uncle and my cousin both killed themselves in the late 2010s and it tore whatever part of my family was left on my dad's side, and I dont want to just be another one to kill myself but it's so hard. I think about the psychological damage it could cause to the few people who care and I dont understand why they care but they do and it's painful."
memes,fem3ecb,t1_feliizs,1579238434.0,"Depressed girls dont act depressed usually to get noticed, usually the ones who listen to billie eilish and dress up like an ""egirl"" or whatever that tiktok dollar store emo style is and make that their personality act depressed to get noticed arent depressed, maybe another mental illness that makes them act insane but not depressed."

AskReddit,feipy1o,t1_fehxd7m,1579144299.0,"Also a letter to elise and Friday I'm in love but maybe just because they bring me back to a happier, better time in my life."

mentalhealth,fdu05nv,t1_fdtxs8p,1578725149.0,"I have a good relationship with my mom and I'm afraid of telling her because I've managed to pretend to look happier and she's happy and everybody else is happy because they think I'm happy and I dont want to disrupt their happiness. I dont want to hurt her by worrying her or for her to blame herself. I've asked some online friends how to do this before but usually it was simple things they told me, like ""make sure she's not stressed or busy."" I'm kind of in a rush to do this since I ruined my thighs and I need to tell somebody before summer so it isnt a big shock. I cant tell when my mom is having a hard time or if she's happy because she hides it so well (she struggles depression and I'm afraid of triggering something) I wish I was as strong as her. I'm also afraid that if I told my family they'd think I'm like my father, who is emotionally abusive and has bipolar disorder. Whenever I'm mad, my siblings fling around insults that I'm acting like him and I dont want them to think that I am. I know my mother would probably be supportive but she does so much for me and goes through so much just for me to be like this. Thank you for replying to me, I really appreciate it. I cant talk about this with my friends, irl and online, because they either arent educated on mental health or do struggle and I dont want to trigger the ones who do struggle."

mentalhealth,fcazcil,t1_fcaz6ac,1577579600.0,"Hopefully she really is strong and I hate when she doesnt realize it. I've been kind of jealous of her for the past 3 weeks because she has been doing what I'm not able to do, I still support her as much as I can despite my silly jealously."

I haven't had a breakdown since Christmas eve and I've been happy for the past 2 days but seeing her hurt today and in a bad place is like a domino affect. Also she has a lot of scarring from cuts and will probably cut tonight because of how bad it is rn, is that enough to get them involved?"
