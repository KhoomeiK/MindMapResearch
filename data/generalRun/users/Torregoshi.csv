dankmemes,ffe31j7,t3_esuwtd,1579835396.0,And don’t forget that you have more “likes” or upvotes than all of their post combined.
dankmemes,ffe22kf,t3_eswx8w,1579834676.0,It still bothers me that my brain processed this image and all I think about was the actor playing Falcon from Avengers.

Even if one of my cousins is the black sheep while growing up, they still love him and believe that he can do great things. That sanamabetch is a teacher now."

Android are so good right now that even their $200 lineup is enough for me only downside is the camera but the rest are awesome like Android one software and 4000mah."

That top Aldous bullshit his way up and I agree that he doesn’t deserve that title but he did found a loophole.

Hope Moontoon will do something about this."
mobilelegends,ff95etn,t1_ff950lm,1579705258.0,"I only see one game that he was feeding, the rest was.. meh. Just buying boots and roaming around the map.
He should be banned for sure. Hope moontoon sees this."
mobilelegends,ff8y9yl,t1_ff8y7nt,1579699944.0,Then report. Ez banned.
mobilelegends,ff8vc7d,t1_ff8v111,1579697337.0,"That’s because I’m resting from this game.

I too had my fair share of angry moments just because of some fucked up players.

A great example of this are players locking MM, others are when their hero gets picked they intentionally feed.

As a tank main, it’s a nightmare to babysit these assholes.

And that particular Aldous deserves to be punished but for what? Many players will just call it Smurfing since he’s a mythic player preying on low elos."
mobilelegends,ff8uy11,t1_ff8ux3e,1579696960.0,Whatever floats your boat.
mobilelegends,ff8ullb,t1_ff8uggg,1579696624.0,"Exactly, he found a loophole and he is abusing it without consequences. 

Unless Moontoon decides to make change the “intentional feeding” to “intentional losing”."
mobilelegends,ff8u914,t1_ff8u0z0,1579696279.0,"This is a turd mentality but how can he be reported when he is not breaking any rules? This is another reason to play with a 5/5 squad. I don’t condemned his actions but I am impressed that he found a loophole on not be banned. 

Oh, don’t worry about my game mentality. You’re free to search me up if you want to."
