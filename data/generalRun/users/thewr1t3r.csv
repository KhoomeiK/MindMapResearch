wholesomememes,ffr4zll,t3_eus7qp,1580150575.0,Ma hart. Way too cute. Long live baby Thor.
MadeMeSmile,ffc9bbj,t1_ffc95l5,1579794484.0,That’s a bit of a bummer. But thanks for the info. Still wish these two a happy future either way.
MadeMeSmile,ffbzk48,t3_ess27a,1579787652.0,I wish I could see this show in the states; I’ve always had to watch clips on YouTube. The compilation one of all the successful first dates is always my favorite but this is hands down “the” best. You can see the shock in his eyes but then you can also see his admiration. She’s so brave and beautiful to be herself and he’s just so accepting. I hope these two are happy.
relationship_advice,ff7yaxh,t3_ertsws,1579661249.0,He gets (got) to go to sleep next to you and wake up next to you. That should be more than enough. What you wear shouldn’t change that.
OffGridCabins,ff54uik,t3_erpaz8,1579580280.0,"Anonymity tends to bring out the best and worst in people. Thankfully the latter tends to be a minority of the people online. Most subreddits have rules against bullying and harassment and the mods are usually quick to respond. 
Of course, whenever you ask for help there’s always going to be the know-it-all’s that would rather look down at their nose at you than actually help."
houseplans,fep1fug,t3_eq91yg,1579309999.0,"You might be able to tuck the WC under the stairs by shifting the stairs over and having a door in the family room. You could then use the computer room as a pantry and make the current WC into a nice office. 
Not sure you need a three piece bath on a first floor. Especially with two en-suites upstairs."
MadeMeSmile,feo00kt,t1_fenyoi9,1579293257.0,"Thanks for the information. But my concern is who does this hurt? If it’s a karma farmer, then they got what they wanted. And if it’s a genuine post, then maybe they got a smile. 
Either way, wish you the best."
MadeMeSmile,fenla39,t3_eq2d6r,1579287107.0,Beautiful? She’s stunning!!! The bangs are banging. And the glasses really compliment her face well. But most of all her courage to put herself out there is truly amazing. Way to go cousin and way to go OP for helping her peek outside her comfort zone!
OffGridCabins,fenkovs,t3_eq4dbg,1579286748.0,"Sounds like you’re looking for homesteading properties. This site might help (never used it myself):
https://www.survivalrealty.com/

If you find any resources like that though, I’d totally be interested. Right now I’m just using Zillow and Redfin and setting the requirements to several acres of land. Living in Florida, anything more than an acre filters out a ton of properties."
toastme,feh9uyz,t1_feh9mev,1579112159.0,A half step back might be discouraging but don’t beat yourself up too much. Your doing amazing. And you should totes be confident you are peerlessly you.
toastme,feh97xp,t3_ep5e77,1579111769.0,"Don’t let your view from the bottom hold you back. This will be your year. And even if it’s only a step or a leap, progress is progress my dude. 
Btw, the way you style your hair is making me really envious. You got quite the look going brother."
toastme,feh8u34,t3_ep5gwe,1579111537.0,"Holy smokes! Congrats doesn’t come close to it. That is such an amazing turn around and I’m soo happy to hear that you’re on your journey. But real talk, your skin is glowing! And it’s really letting your inner beauty shine through. There’s a totally different vibe in the after photos and in your verification photo. Way to go and keep it up!"
DIYHouse,feh8eym,t1_fegpivp,1579111285.0,"I’m never a fan of fixing “symptoms” but this was an excellent idea. But like you said and by looking at the overflow drain, I’m thinking mold is going to make a huge appearance. OP already said they’re renovating room by room, hope this one is next."
DIYHouse,fege8u4,t3_eoxcor,1579089676.0,"You probably are going to need to take it to the studs and redo the whole thing, depending on how far the water is penetrating. I’m not sure why that step is there, it seems like a water magnet to me, so you might want to bump the wall into the tub area to make it flat."
Irrigation,febstan,t1_febsdlu,1578962254.0,"Yea I was hoping to switch my set up to use solenoids but that’ll run $90 versus the $40 valve replacement. 
Thanks again for your input. It’s nice having someone reaffirm my ideas."
toastme,febrq13,t1_febqxjv,1578961916.0,"A sunflower never compares themselves to a rose. Be you and do whatever makes you happy. 
Run your own race. You are perfectly you."
Irrigation,febpb9j,t1_febovuu,1578961276.0,"With pics, what’s something to look for? I installed the optional indexing indicator and can feel it sticking. 
Thanks for the input though. I did reuse a spare but I’m thinking there’s a reason I didn’t use it."
toastme,febmamu,t3_eoaq7d,1578960325.0,"Sorry but you’re the ugliest person in the room? Do you live with Victoria secret models? And even if that’s the case, they’ve got nothing on you. 
The way you style your hair is amazing. Even without makeup you are glowing. The decoration of your room shows you have quite the personality. Quite simply, you are naturally outstanding."
MadeMeSmile,febgerp,t3_eobm9r,1578958570.0,"The genuine love you have for each other comes through in both pics. Congrats on a happy, healthier future together!"
hondacivic,fe7k7d3,t1_fe2eci3,1578915735.0,"My mechanic wouldn’t touch it so I had to take it to the dealership. They charged $2000 but lowered it to $1800 because I bought the car only two months prior. 
I’m somewhat handy but the electronics on the car make me extremely nervous"
hondacivic,fdz4dlm,t1_fdz3wkn,1578786583.0,"Yea I had to replace the module which was stupid expensive. 
Thanks for your comment."
MadeMeSmile,fdsel4j,t3_emziui,1578700918.0,"Congrats. Whether a leap or a crawl, progress is progress. Keep up the great work."
toastme,fdrx3q1,t3_emusgv,1578691025.0,You are absolutely right on both accounts. I snuck a peak at your profile and you are absolutely stunning and have some really outstanding cosplaying talents. I admire your strength and look forward to seeing your growth as an artist and a survivor. Keep on glowing.
toastme,fdp2tq9,t3_emihk9,1578618664.0,"Firstly, those dimples are to die for. But more importantly you are such an amazingly strong individual for standing up for yourself. It sucks when the people we love can’t see the progress we are making for ourselves but that should not discourage you. You are on your path and you’ll continue to be such an idol for so many people. Keep up the amazing work."
BeardAdvice,fdoa9rg,t3_ememm1,1578601582.0,"The shape doesn’t look bad, but it needs a little trimming/comb training. As for the patches, you’ll just have to give it some time to see if anything develops."
BeardAdvice,fdo9zux,t3_emf5co,1578601448.0,Personally I like taking the line in front of the ear straight down instead of that little tag but thats all preference. The neckline looks solid. There are some wisps of hairs connecting the mustache to beard so I’d let it go for a couple of weeks and then see about playing with the shape of the beard. You could always let the mustache go a bit and either have a handlebar stance or curls.
