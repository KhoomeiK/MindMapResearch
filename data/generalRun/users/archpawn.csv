> Enhanced Toughness would be a power, which they call Protection

There's Powers and Power Effects. A Power Effect is the basic building block of Powers. You could make Protection a Power, but not a Power Effect. Even then, it seems a bit too simple to call it a Power.

> A normal human should not be able to just buy Toughness without an explanation.

So they should buy an identical power with a different name? And they can buy stamina without an explanation.

In any case, that doesn't matter. Being a normal human is fluff. If the DM wants to veto supposed humans with superhuman toughness, fine. It's just like vetoing speedsters who don't have absurdly high scores for dodge and parry. But that's no reason to rename their power. It's still just an enhanced ability.

> but IMO ninja minions need to have high Dodge/low Toughness and enemy Roman soldiers need to have the opposite.

As the rules are minions have effectively have little to no Toughness. You'd have to give your Roman soldiers an absurd amount of Toughness to make up for it, which the game will penalize you for and make them more expensive.

You could just give minions in general a boost to toughness and nerf their speed so it stays balanced. Personally I feel like minions don't deserve as many rolls dedicated to them. Though if you really want to reduce rolls the best way to do it would be to come up with some way for them to attack as a group, so you just roll once for all of them. Something like multiattack.

> Minions aren't just there for fighting.

I disagree. If you break into the villains lair, he will have minions that fight you and he might have scientists that are there for fluff. The scientists might have skills in lore, but as far as gameplay is concerned they don't matter. At best they're just bystanders you might feel guilty about accidentally killing, though given what science they're presumably doing I wouldn't feel very guilty.

You might have a scientist that works at your base for flavor. But if you let him be an Inventor so you can get most of the benefits for 1/15 the cost, you're a minmaxer. If you have a familiar or someone you're trying to sneak through the enemy base, they're worth caring about enough to qualify as a sidekick.

And if you really do want minions that can do more than fight, they should at least be more expensive. I get the impression the idea was that for five points in minion, you get a power level 5 character but with the minion attribute. But characters limited by power level can't spend more than about half their points in combat. Minions who mostly only exist for combat shouldn't be treated the same way.

> but a character with Presence-based Expertise skills (Music and Public Speaking, as an example) will turn Presence into an ""overpowered"" stat.

You could say that about any skill. You'd have to run a politics-heavy campaign for public speaking to matter, and I'm not sure when music would ever matter. Getting enough that you're better off buying Presence as opposed to specializing would be very difficult."
mutantsandmasterminds,fg514hv,t1_fg4u0n9,1580515728.0,"It's not that hard to fix most of the individual problems, but there's tons of issues. Should I just dedicate this thread to fixing as many as I can?

Split is another logarithmic issue. Use multiattack instead.

Create says that you can make walls, but only gives how to calculate volume and doesn't say how thick they need to be. Let's say they have to be six inches thick to give a toughness equal to your effect rank. The sum of distance measures is about the volume measure + 15, so with a 6 inch wall the dimensions of the area would add to rank-10. Or rank-6 for a 6-foot high wall (which can be used while walking) or rank-5 for a 3-foot wall (only useful while prone). You can also make it thicker, which adds to the Toughness the same as it subtracts from the distance measures.

Minions are much more effective with points put into dodge as opposed to toughness. I think a good way to deal with them would be to just give them a single defense stat, and have the heroes add their power and accuracy. That way you can just use one roll. It might be good to pool their attacks as well.

The Minion advantage and Summon power assume minions are built like normal characters, which it doesn't make much sense to do. Give them four character points per rank, to be spent on accuracy, damage, toughness, and dodge.

Extra Limbs should not be a power. They're fluff. If they give you some extra ability, you might buy that as a feature.

Affliction's status effects aren't remotely balanced. Compelled is more powerful than incapacitated, and yet is marked the same as prone. Also, a few of them are just different names for the same status effect. I'd either standardize the effects, or try to make a more powerful system where you can buy different effects where the cost is based both on how powerful they are and how much the failure has to be. Ideally Damage could be made part of the same system.

A number of powers are still useful at zero or fewer ranks. For example, being able to fly at or below your running speed. I'd allow these if their cost is calculated like with zero or fewer points per rank. If something costs 5 points per rank, you can buy zero ranks for four points, negative one for three, etc.

Stamina and Fighting both cost two points per rank, and give you two things that each cost one point per rank (technically you can't buy points in Toughness, but you can buy Intrinsic Protection which is effectively the same thing). You may as well not use them.

Protection shouldn't be a Power Effect. It's just Enhanced Toughness.

Area effects are OP. They have to be if you want to justify having one or two powerful people instead of a huge group of minions, but I still think they're a bit too OP. I'd say they all count as five points higher for the purposes of Power Level.

Reaction for standard actions isn't done well. I'd base the cost on Area and Selective, and maybe Quirk or Limited. For example, if you automatically attack anyone that attacks you, that's equivalent to an area attack that only hits the people who attack you.

Presence could be an Advantage rather than an Ability. Having it cost two points for three skills that don't synergize well sounds fair."

Also, I'd recommend trying to make it sound like it's more psychological. Maybe have bled out eardrums, but definitely not broken glass.

It also seems pretty implausible that the sound is heard across the world, but nine stories of basement will protect against it. I'd advise simply making the main characters deaf. Or possibly they had ruptured eardrums at the time (though realistically that would probably protect quite a bit less than nine levels of basement). Or maybe there was a loud explosion just as the sound happened, so they couldn't hear the sound."

gameideas,fg1595x,t3_ew8kmf,1580421007.0,"[Braid](https://store.steampowered.com/app/26800/Braid/) does it in a platformer, or at least something similar. Different areas work different ways.

[Achron](https://store.steampowered.com/app/109700/Achron/) doesn't exactly do that in an RTS game, but it's kind of similar. It has time travel. You can pause the game and tell units to move, and then fast-forward while they're actually moving so you don't get lost in the timeline.

[Death By Obsession](https://www.kongregate.com/games/wigdev/death-by-obsession) and [Turnament](http://www.nitrome.com/games/turnament/) are puzzle games that work that way. In their case, a lot of the difficulty is making sure you're synchronized right. For example, if there's a spike trap that alternates between spikes and no spikes, you can't just wait for the spikes to appear before crossing. You have to move for them to appear."
