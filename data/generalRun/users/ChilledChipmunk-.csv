offmychest,ff4qovr,t3_ermzim,1579570138.0,"Well my friend I’ve been in a similar situation as you I’ve had fake friends since I started 7th grade up until I was 19 (currently 21) it’s never easy I’ve also had a hard time making friends since I was 12 hell I didn’t get a girlfriend till I was 20 and I kept telling myself that I was never gonna get one. The only real advice I can give you is: never doubt yourself, learn from your mistakes as in trace back step by step how you messed up write it down since you don’t notice you messed up till it’s too late and then learn from that, it’s not weakness saying that you’re sorry try reconnecting with those 2 close friends by starting with saying you’re sorry and then keep it going from there. We all make mistakes we all have our downfalls but don’t you dare let ruin you or make it take control, right now you’re looking at all the bad things that has happened but I know that you’re a good person hell I’ll even go as far as saying you’re a wonderful person. Seeking advice from other people is never a bad idea everyone has experience from their mistakes, learn from yours and use that experience to better yourself. Start off by saying you’re sorry to your friends. It’s a start I know you can do it friend"
