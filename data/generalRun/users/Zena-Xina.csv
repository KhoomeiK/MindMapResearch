If someone was trying to argue one way or another about something they had commented differently in the past, that would be different.

This guy was telling people he hoped their dog died just because they posted a picture of their dog somewhere. He told someone else he hoped that the telescope they ordered broke in half. All of their posts were on other subreddits and had nothing to do with the current discussion.

People are going to post what they're going to post or else social media wouldn't exist. But I believe there is a difference between using what they have said in the past against them for valid points and just insulting them unprovoked using their post history."
