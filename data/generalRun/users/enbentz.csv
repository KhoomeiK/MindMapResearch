2007scape,fffj9xe,t1_fffdtch,1579885162.0,"I love your comment so much.  It's so painful when you watch people argue against their own interests because of how badly they've been manipulated by media/ their own ignorance as to how things work.  You get into these really heated discussions with people on the other side of an issue and they argue so passionately for their side without even realizing what they're saying.  In this example, this guy is saying that a country was able to use their resources to provide better lives for their citizens, and they believe that's a really good thing. yet when we want to apply the same idea or logic to our own country, it's ""entitlement"" and ""handouts"" and ""why should other people benefit from my hard work?"".  It doesn't make sense, it's very sad.

I have a friend who has had a torn muscle in her shoulder for 6 months now.  She injured it while working and has been fighting with her company's insurance agency this whole time just to get an MRI.  She still has not gotten it, and has now hired a lawyer to try and help her case... the worst part of this all is whenever I talk to her about Bernie Sanders and his plan for health care she tells me to shut up because ""it's all bullshit"".  She voted and passionately supports Trump.  It doesn't make sense.  She actively votes against her own self-interests and shouts praises for those that duped her."

2007scape,fff7c38,t1_fff622r,1579877546.0,">no one is entitled to anyone else’s labor or wealth. If the government wants to restructure the way they spend in order to provide safety nets then whatever, that’s fine.

Dude, thats exactly the whole argument. We spend billions of our tax dollars on shit that we do not need, easiest example being the military industrial complex. Take that money and use it on a comprehensive healthcare system.  Nobody is saying anybody is entitled to anybody else's labor, we're saying we're entitled to see our government use our tax dollars on things we actually need. Nobody is asking for ""free"" healthcare because we understand it is not free. We want to be able to get a cancer or mental illness and not go broke because of it, rather than spend money on more weapons and bombs to cause more mayhem and destruction in the world.

>But don’t sit there and tell me I can’t enjoy my life because some poor, idiot who works at Dunkin Donuts isn’t enjoying theirs. I didn’t do that to them and I don’t support a system that does.

I didn't tell you you cant enjoy your life bro, check the text, i just told you that you are being ignorant because you should want other people to enjoy a life like yours. I did NOT say you cannot be happy and enjoy things lol, nice try though.  And most of those people working at dunkin donuts have college degrees and are tens of thousands of dollars in debt because they were told they would be able to get a high-paying job with a higher education but they got scammed, so now they have to bust their ass 40+ hours a week sometimes at multiple minimum wage jobs just to be able to barely pay rent and buy food while trying to climb out of debt. My comment to you was trying to plead with you to not say ignorant things like what you're saying right now. 

>not my fucking problem.

Well aren't you a ray of sunshine?

Edit: nice ninja edit, I'm glad you realized calling people idiots for doing their best in life is wrong."
2007scape,fff5sa4,t1_fff3w3t,1579876430.0,"You don't understand... The ONLY health care would be the same health care for everybody, meaning the best we have would be there for everybody who needs it. Any current ""free"" (nothing is free) systems would not exist and cannot be compared to what we would have under a national healthcare system. So you say you'd 100% prefer private health care because you think it's ""better"" than ""free"" healthcare when it doesn't work like that at all."

2007scape,fff53ip,t1_fff24p9,1579875922.0,"You're clearly extremely disconnected from reality if you think that your situation being good means that it's the same for everybody in this country, and it is very much not. Please do not make ignorant statements like this, ""I don’t peg my success to the bottom portion of American society"" because these discussions have literally nothing to do with how successful you are personally. The bottom portion of American society is exponentially larger than that of any other western/ first-world country and that's the issue we need to get to fixing. Like the other person who has replied to you, I am **glad** that *you* have access to these nice things, but millions upon millions do not, so simply saying that nothing needs to change because *you* like your life here is *wrong*, *ignorant*, and *harmful* to millions of human beings. If you like your life, great! You should want other people to be able to experience the same comforts that you experience in life instead of writing off their very real struggles and denying them a good life."
