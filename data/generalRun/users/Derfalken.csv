funhaus,ffeamk0,t3_et35un,1579841384.0,Sounds like James busted a nut when he died at the end.
UpliftingNews,ffbch7q,t1_ffaxgg7,1579759592.0,"> This is how we ended up with shit like the male ""transitioning"" to a female wrestling against female wrestlers and winning the championship. Yeah, no shit. It was a guy wrestling against girls.

Nobody is transitioning to beat people at sports, just like they're not transitioning to creep on people in the bathrooms.  These two topics seem to be pretty popular anti-trans points, but they're just slippery slope fallacies.  It feels the same as the argument that allowing gay/lesbian couples to marry will eventually lead to people marrying animals.  

You need a stronger argument than 'this policy is bad because some trans people won at sports before'."

videos,fewr8kk,t1_few51l8,1579418297.0,Hokay. So. That is a sweet Al Pacino impression you might say. WRONG!

todayilearned,fegteka,t1_fegsk1n,1579102113.0,"Typically you aren't compensated in the US either, but there are companies that will pay.  From my experience, centers where you are not compensated usually supply local hospitals.  

They might have a rewards point system as a way of indirect payment though."

worldnews,feeoyuy,t1_feeop22,1579038184.0,Lol! That's what they thought at least. I think they underestimated horny guys' resourcefulness at beating their meat.
worldnews,feenfd8,t1_feekmtd,1579037288.0,"I don't think catholics typically circumcise; they see it as altering the body God gave you, which is frowned upon. 

Christians in general don't circumcise as much outside the US either. It was introduced as being more hygienic and a deterrent to masturbation, and it just caught on as a common practice after that."

news,fdtqabw,t1_fdrxnn6,1578720534.0,It's not being a dick to suggest people read what they're being told.  People being outraged after reading nothing but a sensational title causes so many problems.
medlabprofessionals,fdtlbg3,t3_en2d9i,1578718411.0,"I'm partway through the series!  I think it's amusing how they interpret the cells.

I was considering watching it a while back, but never got around to it.  Now that it's on Netflix, I figured I should check it out since I'm already subscribed."

Seems like lots of people scream racist at you because you say racist shit."
medlabprofessionals,fdppxf1,t3_emhyli,1578636084.0,"I broke a cell washer during my student rotations.  I apparently didn't balance it properly, and it made a horrible rattling noise.  

I stopped the washer quickly, and inspected the tubes.  They looked fine, so I made sure it was balanced again and tried starting up the washer once more.  There was an even worse noise followed by the tube/holder shattering.  Luckily we had two washers, so we didn't have to start washing manually.

I ended up getting hired at the same hospital, so they didn't hold it against me, lol."
medlabprofessionals,fdn7q9r,t3_em81sb,1578579563.0,That label is gonna be soggy with the tube inside the ice.
