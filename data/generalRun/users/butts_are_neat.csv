AskMen,ffhlg6u,t1_ffggzu3,1579940846.0,"Reading through this few points to make on both sides here.  
 1.theres nothing wrong with only viewing wholesome stuff that's just a preferance of an individual.   
 2.you were jumping to alot of conclusions throughout your argument. Its proven we take in what surrounds us subconsciously. And it does affect psyche. That's all they said not that you see rape so you rape ect. That was just a statement from nowhere hence them saying you aren't grasping what they are saying. 
 
 3.not seeing any violent movies. shows ect puts  in a state where all violence in movies, shows, ect become all the same threads in a rug wich causes you to make very blanketed statements.   
 
 4.I dont disagree with what you're saying about being a product of you're environment but to me it sounds like you're much more sensitive to violence in media then many others. That could be you empathizing with them when others can differentiate between the violence in the show and reality better."

 there are cultural names but just being black isint a ""culture"" as the Zulu is a different culture from the hutu. Theres no reason dimitri should be considered less of a black name (not based on culture)  dimitri is a Slavic variation of the Russian dmitry, a name that comes from the Greek Demetrius.
