AskReddit,ffd6ey2,t3_esz0kd,1579814321.0,"What's interesting is that the other night I was thinking of this and the answer is a definite yes. I love my wife and if I could give birth to her and my two daughters, every night, then I would. At night, before bed, my wife would take our daughters into her vaginal canal, filling her once again as she was only a few months ago. Then, I would unrobe, push my penis into myself, scrotum first, into the cavity behind my perinium, creating a makeshift vaginal canal. My wife would then step into me, like slipping into a pool, her feet slowly widening me, as I contract and pull her deeper into me, slowly at first. Her body would enter a sort of slumber, just as her head disappears into my mangina, my penis becoming erect within me, filling me with the necessary amount of seminal fluid to keep her sustained during the long night hours. I would slip into bed and sleep and rest until morning comes. I would then assume a birthing position and push, ejecting seminal fluid along with pre-birth from within my makeshift whispering eye, the birth of my wife coming soon afterwards. I would lick her clean and bathe her in a loving ceremony before she gives birth once again to our daughters. We would all get dressed and go to Denny's for breakfast, the proper sustenance after our nightly ordeal. An ordeal done out of love and passion."
