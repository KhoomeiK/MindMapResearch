Just a few tips.


You can  use https://www.sqdc.ca/fr-CA/   to  find out the real strain name of the product you purchased (Instead of the sale namew they choose to use for selling.)

Than you can use lift co to get some recent reviews of the strain ( lift co is a site specifically for sqdc/ocs weed review

You can also use wikileaf and/or lift co to determine the effects of the strains ( it gives you a rough idea of the affects the strains will produce.)
