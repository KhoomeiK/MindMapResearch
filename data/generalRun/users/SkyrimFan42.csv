teenagers,fe5r4ul,t3_enviau,1578873384.0,"The thing is, weed isn’t really that bad for you. It’s hyped up by schools and other programs as being really awful, but it’s really not that bad. 

The problem is, doing weed once makes it waaaay too easy and fun to do it again. But only one more time. And then just once more. “One more won’t kill me”. And more. And more. And more. And then, you’ll get bored, or it doesn’t do anything for you anymore, or you’ll get somewhere at the wrong time with the wrong people. And this is what’s bad about weed. It’s a gateway. You’ll start doing cocaine. Or ecstasy. Or heroine. And then stuff gets bad. 

Now, I recognize this is a slippery slope. It’s totally possible you’ll do it once, think, “huh, that was pretty weird”, and never do it again. You never know. But the overwhelming majority of people don’t do that. They think they can do it once, and not more than that. But they can’t. 

Now, of course, I’m some random dude on the internet. I can’t stop you or force you to do anything. In the end, it’s your decision. *But*, I can give you the facts, and there they are. I hope you make the right decision, and whichever decision you do make, good luck."
