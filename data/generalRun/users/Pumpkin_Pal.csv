Sims4,feiywtv,t1_fegjoce,1579151141.0,"The girl on the left is a member of the royal family, the rest of them are marrying in. Because a lot of weddings would be happening around the same time, I put them all in a household together to work on their outfits so i could be sure that I wasn't duplicating and hair or dresses. I then decided to host a sort of princess academy to make sure that they all had the skill levels in skills they would need once married, so singing, piano, violin, painting and flower arranging. Because the kingdom is currently only comprised of Windenburg, The girls on either side are in an arrangement with the most noble family in Willow Creek, the Goths, In which Alexander (he's a ya now, don't worry) will marry the girl on the left (Andromeda) , and Cassandra will marry Andromeda's brother. Alexander will be made the duke of Willow creek, and willow creek with become a section of the kingdom. That will make Andromeda a duchess instead of just a lady, and Cassandra will become a lady. They will probably have a joint wedding, because it's all about the combining of the two families, so the Goths don't try and topple the royals. The other two will get their own ceremonies. the one on the middle left (Candy) is marrying a duke. When the first king's eldest two daughters got married, their husbands where each given the title of Duke, one of the island in windenburg, and one of the districts.  the one of the districts died without a son, so his title passed to his brother. his brother has since died, but he had a son, so Candy will be a double duchess. The one on the middle right (Morgayn) is marrying the king's younger brother and will get the lifetime title of Countess. However, since the king doesn't have any sons, she will eventually be queen as the crown will pass to her husband, the kings brother. sorry for the avalanche of text!!!!!!

unpopularopinion,fdsqg4s,t1_fdsdfxn,1578706615.0,"Most thirteen year olds are very aware of self harm, in fact they most likely know of someone who does or possibly even do it themselves. 

Let's use cosplay as an example here. I am someone with self harm scars on my wrists/ arms (a commmon spot) who wants to cosplay as a character that has short sleeves, I would either have to cover my scars using makeup, which is generally irritating as I would need a different colour of foundation to that that I would use on my face. But I have the luxury of being able to do that, as annoying as it would be. My scars are completely flat. a lot of people's are raised and bumpy, or sometimes dents in the skin, and would be extremely difficult to cover.

This policy, and your views around ""protecting"" people just show the stigma that still surrounds mental health. Tiktok is filled with people showing off injuries and surgery scars however those are allowed, even they are often much more graphic then self harm scars. a scar is something that has healed. there is no need to be ashamed of your scars, they show what you have survived. Having that content removed sends the message to potentially still vulnerable people that they should cover themselves."
unpopularopinion,fdscy5g,t1_fdscik5,1578699782.0,"A. Children shouldn't be on Tiktok, the terms and conditions are that its a 13+ app

B. TikTok still has filters for blood and gore. All the self harm filter is doing is stopping people with scars being able to make content about their experiences and journey, and meaning that if they want to be visible in a Tiktok, there's a good chance that they will have to cover their scars. what kind of message does it send to someone who has been through a lot that they should have to hide themselves to be able to be seen."
