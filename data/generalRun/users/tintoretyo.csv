relationship_advice,ffpap2l,t1_ffmdupu,1580090352.0,"Ok so, I think firstly the op said that they have rowing club together. So it’s impossible for him to be entirely out of her life until that’s not a thing, or he’s not there. I think it would be awful for her to have to give up something she is passionate about, just to avoid an abusive ex. And I actually believe it’s very strong to continue efforts there in spite of it. But I do agree, no contact is always the best path forward when it comes to abusive partners (or any relationships).

Some people in response to this are incredibly insensitive and ignorant. Traumatic bonding is something that happens in abusive relationships; it is incredibly sinister. It’s one of the reasons abusive relationships take, on average, seven attempts to leave before someone is able to get away.  Just from Wikipedia: *Initially, the abuser is inconsistent in approach, developing it into an intensity perhaps not matched in other relationships of the victim. It is claimed the longer a relationship continues, the more difficult it is for people to leave the abusers with whom they have bonded.*

It’s hard to imagine this, if you haven’t experienced it. We also not aware of her history. When you have a history of domestic violence and abusive patterns in your familial relationships; you’re more likely to become a victim later in life. It just makes you more vulnerable because you accept these crazy patterns as normal and associate abuse with love. You can more easily dismiss the alarm bells ringing, the negative emotions, and the abuse. And then they give you some love; they validate you for accepting their abuse. You’re rewarded for staying; you avoid the punishment of attempting to leave or fighting back against those cycles. So I mean, the only way to get away is to have no contact. Because you can’t change them. You need to remove yourself from those cycles. It’s not simple and petty validation people in these scenarios are seeking. It’s also not vengeance. It’s just these cycles are, quite literally, addictive. That’s never a good thing. 

It’s really strange to me that her actions with her abuser sound like she is in denial, but she’s very clearly spoken about the abuse with her current partner.  I can’t compare everyone’s journey to my own, but I am very much at a loss on where she is on hers. 

I don’t think an ultimatum is the solution. I don’t think completely abandoning her is either. It’s more likely that will reinforce in her mind that she does not deserve the kind of love op could give. Or that she deserves love without abuse. But it also seems she’s still very much living in those cycles and it’s really not her current boyfriends responsibility to save her from them, from her ex, or from herself. It’s very easy to live in cycles of abuse and learn from them. It’s very easy to slip into the role of abuser when in a healthy relationship if you don’t self reflect and learn. You have to actively fight against those patterns you have learned until they are no longer your default. You don’t need to be on defence against these cycles that aren’t there. If you don’t seek professional help on that journey, it’s going to be much harder. That’s not to say every victim becomes an abuser, it’s not to say that I think she is or isn’t. But I think it’s something for her to be cautious of. 

It’s absolutely up to her current partner on whether he wants to stick around in this relationship. I think he ought to be wary of codependency. But I think more care needs to be taken about her relationship with this ex. She should not have any contact and figuring out rowing club is a big one there. He’s very clearly still in those cycles of abuse. It’s very clear he’s still manipulating her. Those false cries of sorry, the promises to change, the ultimatums. The intensity at which it switches from one to another. In my personal experience, something I wanted for a little while, was an apology from the man I was seeing who abused and sexually assaulted me. It wasn’t until a little later that I realised that what I really wanted with that was for him to treat me better; him to tell me and show me I did not deserve that abuse. And I realise how foolish that was; how much I was giving him all that power over me; to decide whether I deserved something so horrendous. So I decided I didn’t, and I didn’t need anyone else to tell me that. It was freeing. I think there’s this idea and a hope in many people that they will get some word or action from an abuser that validates all their abuse; that makes it worthwhile; that makes up for it. But what you really need to do is give that to yourself. Let them go and validate yourself. If she isn’t at the stage where she is willing to do those things for her own self, not with ultimatums on current partners end, then it’s probably not the best to remain. That kind of growth only comes from within. And yes, support is important. But no one should sacrifice themselves to support others.

Sorry for lumping my giant essay under your comment! Rambly by nature and I think it’s something I have enough experience in to give a relatively informed opinion."

AnimalsBeingBros,ffgzo9k,t3_ethid5,1579919209.0,"Crows are also super vicious. I was having lunch with some friends outside one day and a pigeon came crashing past and smashed right into a window of a store. It was clearly concussed. Crow came circling. So I decided I would go grab one of the boxes from my car (I was moving house and had a lot on me) and give him a safe space to recover. I asked my friends to watch him while I went as it was a little far. They absolutely gave no shits and didn’t bother defending the poor thing. When I got back the pigeon was torn to pieces. 

Also gave a seagull a chip once and a crow was not happy with it - chased the seagull down and... it did not come back up.

Not to mention when I was a kid I got my too big bike stuck in a sandpit - it was too steep to push it back out and I was struggling trying to. And then crows started dive bombing me. I was only little and ran away screaming. Had to get my gran to rescue my bike for me.

They absolutely terrify me. My uncle has a group he feeds and it’s very cool but nooooo thanks! I always feel on edge when they’re about. Am glad I only have magpies in my tree, they’re aggressive enough!

Like sure you say they’re so smart, smart little assholes; unless you’re bribing them!"
therewasanattempt,ffgjp0p,t1_ffegyv4,1579907794.0,"I mean, a misogynist is quite literally just the definition of someone who dislikes or is prejudiced against women. There’s no argument about the meaning of it. I know people like to argue over the meaning of feminism so they they can compare it to misogyny; but it’s really not comparable. We have a word that is: misandry. But you kind of prefer to use the one that’s really about advocating woman’s rights. As though that’s prejudiced against men. Says a lot about the viewpoint, no?

You kind of lose any impact your argument may have when you’re foolish enough to compare the two and think “slamming “ openly prejudiced and hateful people is bad. But sure, you gotta make whatever efforts you can to seek that victimhood status you so surely crave."
therewasanattempt,fff6jok,t1_ffdd8lk,1579876985.0,"Psssh, everyone knows women don’t masturbate!!!

Tor is just a suffix used with a verb to create an agent noun, right? You can find the verbs and attach the feminine suffix. Or you can just use the verb without forming an agent noun. I do believe the verb is masturbor.

So masturborix? Or masturbatrix, like you said? I’ve only just discovered this suffix I dunno how to apply it here."

TikTokCringe,ffc4rt3,t1_ffba3y1,1579791509.0,"Thatâ€™s a false equivalency. They person youâ€™re responding to was not at all implying fat people donâ€™t have personalities or healthy functioning relationships. Nor were they saying people can only be dated for one thing.

Fetishisation is wholly different to just dating a fat person or being attracted to fat people. Fetishisation is a sexual fixation on something. Note: thatâ€™s something and not someone. Attraction is liking and taking interest in someone. That can be physical, emotional, sexual etc. No one is saying these things canâ€™t overlap; that the object of your fetishisation canâ€™t also belong to someone youâ€™re attracted to. But the person youâ€™re responding to was not saying thatâ€™s unhealthy. They were saying itâ€™s unhealthy to be with someone specifically because of a fetish. Especially one like this.

Something worrying with fat fetishisation would be a desire to change people to meet your sexual fixation: the [wiki ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_fetishism) says that might be a bigger part of this particular fetishisation than you expect. Thatâ€™s an issue because itâ€™s a life altering thing that can have repercussions in a number of ways. People can be fat for a number of reasons and I donâ€™t think badly of anyone for it. But if youâ€™re gaining weight to please someone elseâ€™s sexual desires itâ€™s not great... and definitely not healthy. There are documentaries out there about feeders where you could learn more but they might search for people on the extreme end so grain of salt, yeah?"

blursedimages,ffbq7g4,t3_eslo6g,1579778223.0,"When I was younger I was kicked out of home and I asked my mum to just leave me alone and blocked her number except she didnâ€™t, she then started turning up at my workplace to say â€œhi.â€ It wasnâ€™t to apologise or make things right; she just liked to pretend nothing was happening and everything was fine.  While Iâ€™m living in a shelter. And every damn time I would start breaking down while working checkouts and serving customers. And they would just very awkwardly be there like oh yeah... I have my own bags... no, I donâ€™t have a card to scan. Probably questioning my sanity as my demeanour completely changes with a casual hello from someone walking past. Lots of the time Iâ€™d put my light on and ring the bell for help but if a supervisor was busy and I was serving someone I kind of have to finish serving before I can go to the bathroom and calm down. I also canâ€™t just leave without letting them know where Iâ€™m going. No one was ever mean about it, it was just sooooo embarrassing.

Honestly, itâ€™s awkward as fuck and definitely good policy not to cry while youâ€™re working. I mean I know itâ€™s just a joke but damn if that experience wasnâ€™t awful enough to share."
blursedimages,ffbpzky,t1_ffbll0m,1579777920.0,"The one time I didnâ€™t thank the bus driver was late last year. I think it was because the first bus was 10 minutes early so I missed it. Then he was 10 minutes late (it was an empty bus and traffic was light). He then proceeded to sit and wait at two other empty bus stops for 5 minutes each, one directly after the other. So I was then late for a connecting train which added another 40 minutes wait time for the next one on a 40 degree day. And on top of that he would take off speeding while people were getting to their seats and force them to stumble.

I still felt guilty and petty for not giving him a wave and a thank you. It god damn he was bad at his job.

Edit: by people I mean me. And I also remembered what set me off most was in the city there was a stop where heaps of people got on (I was getting off on the next stop) and there was a woman running up trying to get on the bus and he closed the doors when she was veeeerry close and waving and went off without her.

Theyâ€™re more likely gonna avoid the risk of something fighting back so long as they arenâ€™t starving and desperate.

Seems more like itâ€™s used as an ego boost for insecure people then, and it gets pretty nasty. Like memes about stereotypes are one thing; finding a random person you know nothing about and bullying them about their looks (and getting large groups to) is just shite.

Also am all about people expressing themselves through their style. I think itâ€™s pretty wonderful weâ€™re able to do that. Maybe cause Iâ€™m slightly outlandish with my own style - I think to me itâ€™s about artistry and it gets pretty fun.

justneckbeardthings,ffaqmab,t1_ffa8jti,1579742197.0,"I follow quite a few people who wear vintage clothing as their regular daywear and they pull them off just fine. I think the bigger issue is popular fashion and most individual style has moved on from when they were a common accessory, and when they looked good with a lot of clothing because of this. Some people might make it work outside of suits but it just does not suit jeans and a t-shirt with whatever blazer 3 sizes too big that you manage to find in a thrift store.

Definitely doesnâ€™t make you cool but expressing yourself through style is pretty neat. When it works, it works.

Talking about the fedora here, not the trilby; that looks like a weird iteration of the hat from the Robin Hood Disney cartoon. I havenâ€™t seen people wear those outside stereotypes and a very bad period of fashion in the late 90s - early 2000s."
PublicFreakout,ffadozv,t1_ffa00zd,1579733132.0,"I feel like thatâ€™s not a worldwide truth. 

Itâ€™s possible being assaulted (however deserved) and publicly humiliated and shamed, not just in person but now online as well, might cause him to lash out towards others who are less capable of protecting themselves or in quieter scenarios. Itâ€™s like that stereotypical story we see: where the kid in school is a big bully and itâ€™s because his father bullies him at home. People can and do pass on those negative emotions to others in unhealthy ways. You just might not see it.

Iâ€™m not saying they will, but one person getting small after being confronted by many people does not mean his attitude has changed in the slightest. Some people learn with tough love, some people donâ€™t. My mum always says when someone is nasty to her she gets motivated to prove them wrong; when someone is nasty to me I internalise it and lose motivation. People are just different and they deal with things differently. If this person is already a bully to defenceless, will that change with a beating? Maybe? Itâ€™s definitely another stereotypical story we see all the time. Feels weird to want that though. Also doesnâ€™t address the underlying issues that may be causing lashing out; it either makes them afraid of your violence or opens their eyes to the pain they have been inflicting. Not a gamble Iâ€™d make lightly.

Also people arenâ€™t afraid of using violence, it just should not be the go to solution for problems that can be solved in other ways. Violence shouldnâ€™t be easy and it shouldnâ€™t be fun. It also can escalate things drastically - Iâ€™ve used violence to defend myself against a threat and it only escalated from there and I had to use more violence to even survive the scenario that I created. And it likely wouldnâ€™t have gone that far, at that time, if I hadnâ€™t seen danger and felt like it was my only defence. This person had been violent with me in the past which is why I wanted to beat them to the punch and it was awful, it also didnâ€™t stop their abusive  behaviour. It just meant they could justify what they did to themselves and others. Maybe I just didnâ€™t give a strong enough beating? Am I supposed to get a gang of men to beat up bad guys? Or do I do it myself? Does that make me the bully? Or my gang the bully? When do we cross that line? Confusing stuff tbh. But if the military are volunteering to beat up people, I know a guy."

criticalrole,ff8mlhq,t3_erc913,1579686043.0,"The only reason I dislike the idea that itâ€™s the same woman for all/most is just how pre-ordained it makes their meeting and destinies feel. Thereâ€™s already a lot of those coincidences showing up in fun ways like Fjord and Cads stories intertwining. Having the same woman come through each of their lives and touching them in some way before they met makes the world feel too small and their freedom almost non-existent. 

I like that it was a bunch of mistakes and coincidences bringing them most all of them together to meet in an inn and develop friendship and family from there.

Not saying itâ€™s bad or uninteresting to theorise. I enjoy that or I would be reading threads like these. Just that eventuality is not to my taste. I hope itâ€™s more seperate stories and motivations. Most I could see together is Beau and Nott. But even then, why did the witch want to transform Nott into a goblin in the first place? And why make it almost impossible to transform back? And  I donâ€™t think we know all the nitty gritty of the deal with Beaus dad and I am so keen to find out more and explore her backstory sometime soon (I hope).

I think the motivations behind the characters and their choices are really interesting and Iâ€™d love to hear more about people thoughts on that. Especially the person who gave Caleb his memories back; who would do that and why? Itâ€™s a risky move for something with seemingly little payoff for them."
Anne,ff8eea3,t1_ff89nbn,1579674959.0,"Hey, itâ€™s clear youâ€™re very upset about peoples disagreement and dislike of the email you sent and posted on here. Itâ€™s also very clear youâ€™re young. I donâ€™t hold any of that against you but I think you ought to take a moment to breath and self reflect. Youâ€™re not a victim here. Disagreement is vital in communities, itâ€™s important to learning. People felt your email did not reflect the thoughts of the community here, nor was it likely to illicit the change you desire. People took the time to let you know that. Itâ€™s not an attack on you, nor it it meant to make you feel unwelcome in a community youâ€™re clearly passionate about. What you decide to do with those feelings is your prerogative but I can say with certainty youâ€™re not unwelcome because of a silly email. No one is forcing you out, even if it may feel that way. You donâ€™t have to force yourself out or even lash out because you feel rejected. 

I think itâ€™s commendable that you are passionate about this show and that you want to make efforts in having it renewed. However, I do think itâ€™s important to undertake these things in a reasonable manner. I think itâ€™s important to be careful and considerate in how you speak with others where possible; especially when youâ€™re asking them for something. Your best bet is taking a break, a breather, listening, and learning from the experience. I am sorry you felt hurt by the disagreement you met here but that doesnâ€™t make it any less valid. Donâ€™t double down on childish or entitled behaviour in response, donâ€™t force yourself out. You donâ€™t need to do that. And it wonâ€™t help you grow as a person."

Itâ€™s terrible. This man has very little, and these people felt it was their right to take even more from him. How fucking callous can you truly be? Itâ€™s just an ego boost to them; the ability to satisfy their predilection for cruelty without acknowledging thatâ€™s what itâ€™s truly about. The dog looked clean and in good health.

You ought to just watch it and see how you feel about it. Itâ€™s a good show. Itâ€™s funny and charming. The storylines are engaging and the characters well written. The music is beautiful, as is the scenery and sets. Everything is done in very high quality; it really just depends whether you like period pieces and linear stories instead of sit com format. No one knows that but you, and no one forms those opinions because of gender or sex."

dragonage,fdmiteu,t3_em531n,1578551448.0,"People watch streamers for their personality, right? I donâ€™t feel like this would be a way to get people vested in your personality. Itâ€™s a game heavy with dialogue, so youâ€™re either talking over it all time or pausing to discuss it; which will make things drag on a lot. Dialogue options are also one of the game features, and when youâ€™re watching you donâ€™t really have control over that, which isnâ€™t very entertaining. The combat isnâ€™t interesting enough, and doesnâ€™t hold enough weight to draw people in. But I suppose that could be where you try to let your personality shine through. Problem is; I think you would kind of already need to have followers who are interested in you to do that successfully.

Itâ€™s also not the best audience because people who like dragon age have most likely played them all. And one of the biggest draws to playing them is making your own decisions, so itâ€™s not likely anyone who hasnâ€™t will want to watch streams religiously. At least, itâ€™s not enough people to make it worth the investment of your time and money. Itâ€™s also probably not a good foundation of followers. 

Itâ€™s kind of just a big ask of people who have no reason to really watch you play the game. They donâ€™t know you, or have an investment in your success. And itâ€™s a long game that doesnâ€™t have much excitement for an audience who isnâ€™t making the decisions that impact the game in an interesting way (holding votes would not be the best solution). You would be expecting people who arenâ€™t invested in you, who donâ€™t have a connection to you, to watch 4 hour streams of you playing a game. And they wonâ€™t be able to just watch whenever because itâ€™s story focused, so they would have to keep up. Itâ€™s just way too much to expect to really be successful with.  I think you need to think very rationally about these things if growth is your goal. What are you expecting or an audience? Is that enjoyable to them? And would you support someone doing the things that you decide to do?

However, the most important thing is just to stick with what you like because,honestly. Itâ€™s an over saturated market so you may as well enjoy what youâ€™re doing. If thatâ€™s dragon age, do it! Who cares how many people will watch. If youâ€™re focused on numbers and growth,  which your post makes me think is the goal, I donâ€™t believe it to be the best choice.

I think people really enjoy those err, battleground games? Because there are stakes and itâ€™s very fast paced. I donâ€™t personally watch streams outside of critical role, which is very different to that genre. But I would assume the quick nature allows people to drop in and out and not feel completely lost. In addition to the stakes being high enough that there is suspense and a win is exciting for the audience. Which makes for an enjoyable watch, and is one of the reasons itâ€™s such a successful genre of streamed gameplay."
Anne,fdktmrs,t3_elut4b,1578510905.0,"I really wanted Miss Stacey and Bash to get together, I loved their connection and it felt like the foundations for it. But Iâ€™m happy they didnâ€™t rush into it, even though itâ€™s more likely than not we wonâ€™t see a 4th season. It would have been far too complex a situation to tackle well in just a few episodes. And I think something they always did very well in the show was pacing. So it makes me happy to know that even with cancellation, they didnâ€™t sacrifice pacing to that extent and just left it open for us to imagine. Which, I think we all know, Anne would approve of. 

Iâ€™m actually relieved that Anne and Miss Stacy arenâ€™t related though. I always feel like that runs to possibility of making the world feel too small and itâ€™s such an unnecessary coincidence. Which you donâ€™t want when all stories have to rely on some coincidence some of the time. Iâ€™m also not sure how much it would have added to either of their stories. I feel like Anne found a home and family, it was also very important for her to discover where she came from but she found peace knowing she was truly loved as a child; that she wasnâ€™t abandoned intentionally.  Iâ€™m not sure where you would go with the story if the opposite were true. But Iâ€™m also just a sucker for happy endings.

Love your idea about seeing a contrast with Diana in finishing school and Anne at Queens. Though I suppose if thereâ€™s no hope for season four itâ€™s the best outcome. I just wish there was more closure for Jerry. It felt like he was just a prop to her story. And he was, I think she almost tested the waters a little with him and found she wanted more than what was on offer for her, to the point she could stand up for herself. But, I dunno. I think they could and would have done a lot more were they given more time (and seasons) to explore the stories in.

Iâ€™m going to stop rambling now!"

Either way, just wanted to clarify; Iâ€™m definitely not saying they did it out of the kindness of their hearts. Nor that the severity of the tragedy is not caused by their malicious incompetence. Was merely stating that they have pledged it and to say otherwise would be spreading misinformation."
