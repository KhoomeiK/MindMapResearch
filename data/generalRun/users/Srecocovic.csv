hiphopheads,ff7on2w,t1_ff6mfcq,1579654589.0,As an eminem fan myself I think it is a good thing that there is no EM feature on this one. Royce deserves so much more recognition outside of core rap audience.

hiphopheads,ff3uwfm,t1_ff3uk35,1579549379.0,Born in Yugoslavia raised in Croatia and now im in sweden
hiphopheads,ff3eltd,t1_ff3d5l9,1579539497.0,That part I agree with you. But then again. We don't use the same language when we talk to a priest or small children. You don't use word like cunt pussy and so on around small kids but yet we use it when we talk to adults. I personally would never use that word just like I will never call someone a faggot.
hiphopheads,ff3b9wj,t1_ff3abwy,1579537808.0,"No need to apologize. I guess there is only that much that books and videos can teach you. Reading it and living are 2 very different things. I grew up during war and lived as an refuge for almost my entire life. I know how it feel when people use words against you because of the way you look or where u from üòä. I always welcome a good  discussion, we don't have to agree on everything but we can keep the conversation civil."
hiphopheads,ff3a40v,t1_ff39kqe,1579537203.0,"You are right, I do not live in the US. I'm looking from far away.  And I get your point, and I wouldn't use the wort at the concert  because like you say people could be offended.  Over here it is not as heated as over there.  I myself am an immigrant  and most of my friends are from all over the world . And when we sit together and listen to music we sing along. The black one the Indian the Arab  and the  Balkan one. But again. I get your point too"
hiphopheads,ff38quf,t1_ff384zg,1579536357.0,The only point I was trying to make is  that you can't forbid words. People who use it to harm other people should be buried under the prison. If I put a biggie record on at home and loose myself in the moment and sing along I will eventually use the n word but only because I love the song. I put no bad thoughts what's however in it.
hiphopheads,ff37uiq,t1_ff34b5q,1579535757.0,If you can't tell the difference between an moron saying it in pure hate and a fan singing along to an album then I don't know what to tell you.
hiphopheads,ff36tn0,t1_ff368uc,1579535067.0,The point is the same. My point is  restricting the usage of a word to certain people is wrong.  I never said  white people should use the word. Am I wrong when I tell a chappelle joke that contains the n word in it?
hiphopheads,ff35yba,t1_ff35dxt,1579534469.0,"I would argue that Europeans knowledge of American history and geography is  better that the other way around. Just the fact that you still argue for the right to bare arms versus innocent lives is saying a lot. Every statistic comes to the same conclusion yet you ignore it and use ""guns don't kill people do bla bla"" if there are more shootings in USA alone compared to the rest of the world and the only difference is the fact that you have your gun laws. It doesn't take a genius to see where the problem lies."
hiphopheads,ff34ucc,t1_ff34gd1,1579533706.0,"I never used the word outside of quoting a movie or a lyric. And I agree with you that people shouldn't use it. Than again, feom my experience it is quite difficult to engage in a good rational conversation with an American. Just look att the whole owning a gun question. Americans are blinded by their past"
hiphopheads,ff340dx,t1_ff33w21,1579533108.0,Don't get mad when your argument is crushed.
hiphopheads,ff320it,t1_ff31vd6,1579531596.0,That's my whole point. It is the meaning you put into Word what makes them powerful
hiphopheads,ff30d1n,t1_ff2zwnw,1579530264.0,Understand your angle. Wouldn't you agree that the black culture is overusing the word?
hiphopheads,ff2zm0y,t1_ff2zczr,1579529639.0,"I totally understand that. My point is, you can't forbid words. Then again just because you can say anything that doesn't mean you should do so. It is just weird to me that one side  glorifies it ant the other side uses it as an insult. I don't thing black people bborn after 2000 are aware of what that word used to mean and why it is such a hot potato."
hiphopheads,ff2z7vb,t1_ff2yo5i,1579529308.0,"That's where we disagree
. Artist censure their music for the sake of revenue. So if an white actor uses that word in a movie that means that he is racist?.  If I say a lemon is yellow and use the word yellow to describe a Asian person, that right there are 2 tot different things"
hiphopheads,ff2yxsq,t1_ff2yjff,1579529061.0,"Why is it then thrown around so much by the African American then? Is it OK for mentally challenged people to call each other retards but not for the rest. With that logic only the Germans should use the word nazi. To me it is just another word. But I get it, Americans are pretty blind when it comes to logic."
hiphopheads,ff2xbh9,t3_era35p,1579527586.0,As an European imma stand back in this conversation because I don't see the big deal here.  When I listen to rap I recite all the words. The only time I use that word is when I si g along with the lyrics or refer to a certain comedy bit. It's not what you say but how you say it. Just take the word Shit as an example
soccer,fez3zed,t3_eqyu7j,1579453618.0,"When will Uefa put an end to all the bs when players tin towards the ref. Only in football, all other sports as soon as you even touch the ref u out. Especially now when we have var, no need for this crap"
Eminem,fevsza2,t1_fevshjh,1579401080.0,It's the year 2020 and the top 2 selling hip hop artists are 2 white guys. 1 is 47 and the other one dead. Rip. Now go back to 1997 and tell it to the peooleüòÇüòÇ
Eminem,fetrjr4,t1_fetq7f6,1579378984.0,The race issue is a whole other story. I live in Sweden and born in Croatia. So the race thing is hard for me to understand mainly because we didn't have the same history when it comes to these kind of issues. I thing the death of African Americans by the police is an indirect consequence of the gun laws you guys have.. Still wish you all the best there are still a lot of positive things when it comes to you guys.. üòÅüëå
Eminem,fetp3pt,t1_fetoe2i,1579377866.0,"Anywho. We don't have to agree on everything, I still respect your view. It is nice for a change to have an argument online without foul language for onceüòÅ. By the way, your 2 party system and the way you elect your president is a whole another topic.. But that we can take another time..  For now lest enjoy Marshalls newest gospel ü§£üëå"
Eminem,fetoe2i,t1_feth92k,1579377586.0,"But if your job is to protect people and act against criminal and violent people then their surly should be a clear difference versus a regular citizen. If I understand your thought process correctly then the same logic applies to the government... If the president has drones than I as American should have the same right to have  a military drone so I can defend myself?  There is a valid reason why a doctor can handle portend drugs and a civilian can't, there is a valid point why the security at an airport is higher than at a bus station."
Eminem,fetehkz,t1_fetcvr2,1579374593.0,"I would agree with you 100% if the year was 1900, where the gun balance  was pretty even (people vs government) well not even maby but  the people could overthrow it. The citizens having guns to defend themselves against the government in 2020 and having no guns has still the same outcome. A gun against a fleet of drones and nuclear weapons I think we all see a clear winner here. That's why we change laws throughout time. Having a slave now VS in 1800süòÅ. Giving your history I get where your mistrust against the government comes, I do. At some point people need to ask themselves the question. Is my right to own a gun worth all those innocent lives?"
Eminem,fet8fiw,t1_fet80dj,1579372732.0,If you see the 1st and the 2nd as the same. How come the outrage is absent when Facebook bans certain words and as soon we talk about guns  everybody looses their mind?
Eminem,fet84xx,t1_fet5gta,1579372636.0,"I see your point. There are similar things yes. And I totally agree with you when it comes to companies limiting your speech. However the big difference here is the outcome. The fact that it is so easy to get a gun in the US without hardly any backups is just madness. The gun issue is just an issue in the US. Many countries had same laws like the US. Most of them changed their laws when a huge gun related disaster struck. My personal opinion is that a random person should not own a firearm, there is no logical argument. And saying guns don't kill, people do is just the easiest excuse someone can give. Using hate speach and using a gun against a group of people is a huuuge difference wouldn't you agree? The outcome can't be compared"
Eminem,fet3dyy,t3_eqjpcc,1579371422.0,Any person with a brain that isn't from USA doesn't even see this as a topic. It is just the American people with their over the top worshipping of their constitution. And the argument that you should have the right to own a firearm so you can go up against a government is just retarded. I mean it is literally  bringing a gun to a drone fight. But arguing with an American regarding gun laws is like trying to explain to a vegan that it can be ok to eat meat.
