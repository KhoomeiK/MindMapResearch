The algorithm spits up a certain video for a tangential reason. Things that are suggested have a much higher likelihood of being clicked that those that are not suggested. 

So they get clicked on. And being clicked on raises the likelihood they are suggested. A feedback loop.

AskReddit,fdzzzv5,t1_fdzq58i,1578799798.0,"Look, there's more than one way to look at things like that.

As a moderately attractive guy (when I'm feeling positive), to my mind that result could likely come down to a combination of insecurity that if a ""moderately"" attractive woman is accomplished then moderately attractive men feel that that  it might imply have nothing else to offer.  That's not a slight on women, more a sad reflection on how little value we're led to think we have -  its not enough to be a similar attractiveness, but we need to be a provider, or some other added-value-feature.

To the other alternative in that study - very attractive, accomplished women could occupy a purely fantasy role - it's obvious that they aren't potential mates, so the reality of social conventions doesn't really matter.There are very few guys, even if they are aware of how objectively physically attractive they are, would seriously think they could end up in a serious relationship with a physically attractive, high-powered woman (unless they are also in a high-powered role)

In any case, I've never known any of the many ordinary guys I've encountered in my life to ever be hung up on a woman's intelligence or job. I have plenty of friends whose girlfriends/wives have more highly responsible and/or paid jobs than them. They're just pretty happy and proud about it. Almost every single guy I know in a seriously happy relationship is with what might be considered a ""moderately attractive"" woman. None of them have ever said on nights out that they wished they were with someone else. They're genuinely in love.

As I've said in another comment, in my experience, guys who are extremely picky about physical attributes, or any other criteria, have always been seen as pricks by the vast majority. To us, they're the outliers, and pretty pathetic."
