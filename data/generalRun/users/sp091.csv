If the only mental image they have of vegetables is some tasteless mushy green stuff, it makes sense that they'd think healthy people are miserable all the time."
fatlogic,fgj8uzh,t1_fgdvb5k,1580839269.0,"This is the root of the problem. The people I know with significant weight/health issues literally do not like healthy foods. Why? They're not used to them, never really ate those foods, have no cultural or sentimental attachment to those foods, don't know how to cook those foods correctly, and think of anything healthy as ""diet food"" which automatically makes it feel boring or worse, triggers negative feelings for them. 

Healthy foods can even start to feel like a threat to them, or a sign that the person who's eating those foods is judging them for their size or lifestyle."

Obviously it's best to really learn anatomy, but that's easier said than done! So these tools are really useful while you're learning. Making comics is so much easier and speedier when you aren't relying on photos so heavily.

Same for backgrounds. Study perspective drawing so you can easily draw the basics of a scene, and then use reference photos to fill in details. You shouldn't be trying to find images that are exactly the right setting and angle – that's impossible and a huge waste of time."
AskReddit,ffxat40,t3_evq0kw,1580321337.0,"I love it. I'm a comic artist, and most of what I do is figurative, meaning it has to look like things and make sense lol

But art doesn't have to BE anything to be nice to look at. People think abstract art is easy or pointless and say ""My kid could do that"". But it's not. I've been making art for a long-ass time, and I've never made an abstract piece that I was proud of. You have to know how to make a pleasing composition, be an expert in color theory, know how to use your medium and tools, and have a cool aesthetic.

Maybe an abstract art piece that you bought because it goes well with the colors in your living room didn't take as much work or skill as a complex renaissance painting. But that doesn't mean it has no value or meaning, and it doesn't mean it isn't ""Art""."
AskReddit,ffxaj1o,t1_ffx9bgw,1580321167.0,Yeah I'm small and generally just bounce off people lol you just have to go with it. Also take your glasses off if you wear them and make sure all your personal items are safely put away so you don't drop stuff
AskReddit,ffx8py2,t1_ffwpj2o,1580320090.0,"This is exactly it. I have friends who are into the furry subculture. I don't understand the appeal, but from talking to them I think I have a pretty good understanding of what the appeal is for other people. It's very rarely just a sexual thing and for some people that doesn't factor in at all. There's the whole community aspect of it, the art, being able to play with your identity and create an alter-ego. It's like playing a video game. You create a character, make friends, role play, etc. You just happen to be an anthropomorphic animal."

HealthAnxiety,ffuwe57,t1_ffut9p3,1580250607.0,Yeah could be! Are you sure you actually have high blood pressure or could that be an anxiety thing? My BP always measures higher at the doctor's office because of anxiety.
HealthAnxiety,ffuu6ed,t3_ev1l6k,1580249402.0,"Lactose intolerance happens on a scale. Some people can process more lactose than others. Also, every dairy food has a different amount of lactose. If you look on the label, the amount of sugar (in something unsweetened) is the amount of lactose.

For example: I can't have too much milk or soft cheeses, because they have more lactose, but I can have harder cheeses and most yogurt, because they have less."
HealthAnxiety,ffut4xt,t3_ev7cun,1580248847.0,"A lot of people (maybe even 50%) who live far away from the equator get vitamin D deficiency. Especially in the winter. I get it too, and it's generally nothing to worry about. The supplements will fix it. Low testosterone doesn't mean you have cancer. There can be a lot of different causes. Ask your doctor about it, and see if they think you should be referred to an endocrinologist.

Anxiety can cause sleep problems."

There's some interesting research that's looking into why we need so much orthodonture in the modern day environment and what we can do about it.

comic_crits,fdok88a,t1_fdojjvs,1578606821.0,"Oh ""All the way to black"". When you scan the page in, you want to bring it into an image editor of some kind and do a levels adjustment. That will ""flatten"" your darker gray tones in the ink to black. This is especially important if you ever plan to color."
comic_crits,fdoi435,t3_ec1tsk,1578605603.0,"Your grasp on character acting, poses and action, is strong, and your scenery is really nice. But I would say to be a little more careful with anatomy. Playing with proportions works fine with the more dynamic poses, because they’re supposed to be exaggerated, but in the more straightforward poses it doesn’t look right. It actually ends up looking like mistakes and makes your comic look more amateur than it should. If you don't have a super good grasp on anatomy I'd recommend doing some studying and getting a book on constructive anatomy. Drawing the Head and Figure is a classic and really helps you be able to build a figure from the ground up: [https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Head-Figure-How-Handbook/dp/0399507914](https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Head-Figure-How-Handbook/dp/0399507914)

Another option is to get a posable figure to use as reference, like a Body-kun: [https://www.amazon.com/Bandai-Figurine-S-H-Figuarts-Version-4549660040880/dp/B0177DRVT0](https://www.amazon.com/Bandai-Figurine-S-H-Figuarts-Version-4549660040880/dp/B0177DRVT0)

You should also change your font. It's important to use a font that's made for comics. It will look way more professional. Check [blambot.com](https://blambot.com)

Also remember the rule ""Show, don't tell"". For instance in chapter 1, where we see the girl's head and it says ""Totally unaffected"", etc. It would be better to show her in context, maybe set apart from the group looking in a different direction. Rather than a floating head with text describing it.

I think to sum up: You're a good artist, and your comics could be amazing, but just be a little more careful! In order to get and keep reader's attention, you don't just need a good story, your art needs to come across as relatively professional and a bit more ""finished""."
comic_crits,fdoegxz,t3_elyii8,1578603607.0,"I think an easy improvement you could make for future comics is to use a thinner line width for the backgrounds. If you use the same thickness for the lines, the characters tend to blend in with the background and it can get visually confusing. You might also want to push your inks all the way to black rather than keeping the gray wash effect there.

I'd also recommend doing some studying on perspective drawing so you can improve your backgrounds! As it is, things look kind of ""flat"" which can be cool in a medieval drawing kind of way if you can pull it off, for instance in this example from Zelda wind waker: [https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c\_fill,f\_auto,fl\_progressive,g\_center,h\_675,pg\_1,q\_80,w\_1200/nonqnrixm5y7tinueync.jpg](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/nonqnrixm5y7tinueync.jpg)

I'd also recommend getting more consistent with your lettering. There are some spots that are smaller than the rest and it makes it hard to read. Overall though the story is cool, and I like the way you do facial expressions and the way you draw the characters in action!"
comic_crits,fdocxfq,t3_ei6vfu,1578602873.0,"This is only useful advice if you're planning on drawing the comic too (it's not clear if you're just a writer or not). 

I'd recommend getting some books on comics! And then just make a comic. Doesn't matter if it's not that great, the important thing is that you make something. You'll learn a ton just through trial and error.

Focus on learning all the skills needed to make a professional comic – Not just how to draw, but practical things like how to set up the pages, how to create storyboards/thumbnails, how to ink and what tools to use, how to color in the computer, etc.
