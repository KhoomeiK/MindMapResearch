Like, we didn't even have time to miss them? The exceptions are Shangela and Vanessa Vanjie, where they're the early boot and they bring them right back into the next season."

wholesomememes,fenpoc8,t3_eq0vt7,1579289039.0,"My son is the happiest baby/toddler. Loves the attention he gets from anyone. Anytime we're out in public, if he catches anyone's eye he's always cracking them up and vice versa. My daughter, not so much. I always felt for the people who tried with her as a baby. She doesn't like anyone, don't take it personal. Thank you for trying."

canada,fej3cda,t1_fej2akt,1579155343.0,"I never said they don't need security. I said Canadians don't need to pay for it. Quite frankly if I was British I'd hate paying for it too, but I'd especially hate them creating extrenous costs by travelling to Canada repeatedly."
canada,feiz990,t3_ep8x2n,1579151441.0,"They are staying down the street of my uncle's house right now. Apparently it's just crawling with security. I am not sure whose (UK's or Canada's) dime it's on. Either way, none of us should be paying for it. I'm all for them getting away from the crown, but do they really need to go travelling? Work on establishing yourselves away from it in England. Then travel with your security out of your own pocket."

BPDlovedones,fea3g8y,t1_fe9x5of,1578943939.0,"Is she diagnosed BPD? If yes, it will rear it's head. Just trust. Took like 5 years for my brother and his ex (they have a kid together). It was so frustrating seeing her gain all this pity on social media and ""friends"" because our family ""kept their daughter away from (her)."" She'd call my dad abusive, my mom a hoarder, my brother a master manipulator and gaslighter, etc. Called her own mom a prostitute, her step dad a rich egomaniac (she never failed to mention how rich they were), blasted her brothers learning disabilities to the public and blamed it on her parents, all sort of stuff. Anyone who cared for her genuinely, she had venom to spout about. Just made up so many stories about all of us that I think she truly believed. Anyway, here we are now... She's been homeless on and off again, in and out of mental institutions, assault and b&e charged against her, lived in a group home she got kicked out of... All in the last year. Honestly it's really fucking sad but her house of cards had to come down on her eventually. And how fucking sad is it that this is a story of hope for you?

Anyway... In the first year I often gave in and gave her the reaction she wanted. Trying to set the record straight, responding to her posts on Instagram or facebook, indulging anyone curious IRL with the details. It got us no where and only negatively effected my own mental health. I just learned to be happy with the things that were better now regardless of her actions. I don't have to see or talk to her. My niece is 100% in my brother's guardianship. She is well nourished, goes to an excellent preschool, has ballet every week and swims twice weekly. When people mention her I'm just like ""eh hope she gets better so my niece can have a mom."" I don't know how to put it eloquently, sorry. I guess just focus on all the garbage that's out of your life and try to start fresh without her. It sounds a lot harder in your case because your career was effected, but actions speak louder than words. Just remain who you are and people will cast their own judgements."
