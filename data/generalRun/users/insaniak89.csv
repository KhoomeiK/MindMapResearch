I’ve been throwing for maybe 2 years now. I’d recommend PLSTC by SF yoyo.

It is AMAZING! It comes with bearings for responsive and unresponsive. For most people, once they get comfortable binding, they don’t do responsive play anymore. There’s some cool stuff out there, but the main stuff for 1A is unresponsive. 

The PLSTC is one of my favorite throws hands down, and it gives any of my metal throws a run for their money.

The first base is another highly recommended beginner throw, again it comes with both responsive and unresponsive bearings. It was my favorite plastic until the PLSTC came out, and it’s just a fantastic yoyo. I like it more than a lot of premium throws I have.

Also, /r/throwers is the place to go for yoyo stuff. Very, very beginner friendly community. And IMHO yoyoexpert is *the* place to buy from. They’ve got everything and they ship fast. Yoyofactory does do some really cool sales from time to time.

OpenMediaVault,ff6sw1h,t3_erupij,1579634197.0,"Unlike many file systems, ZFS is intended to work towards specific aims. Its primary targets are enterprise standard data management and commercial environments, with hardware capable of supporting ZFS' capabilities for data resilience and the resources needed to serve data efficiently. If the system or its configuration are poorly matched to ZFS, then ZFS may underperform significantly. In their 2017 ZFS benchmarks, ZFS developer Calomel stated that:[16]

""On mailing lists and forums there are posts which state ZFS is slow and unresponsive. We have shown in the previous section you can get incredible speeds out of the file system if you understand the limitations of your hardware and how to properly setup your raid. We suspect that many of the objectors of ZFS have setup their ZFS system using slow or otherwise substandard I/O subsystems.""


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS?wprov=sfti1

I think your “low end hardware” is going to cause major problems. I think you’d be better off using a more traditional end user FileSystem ext4 for example, then just copying data when you can set up a raid.


**Without setting up a raid your not going to get much in way of protection. ** when a drive is damaged, it repairs itself with information from at least 1 other drive.

This parts dum:
Theoretically you could (maybe? Idk zfs very well) set up multiple volumes in a RAID1. Having raid, of any kind, on a single disk isn’t the greatest idea essentially the systems going to want to write everything twice to the same disk and it’s going to reduce stuff by half. That may be tolerable with media files, but doing that to the OS sounds like something that’ll cause massive headaches."

Here’s a quote from her on the subject (**emphasis** mine)

>	The first of O’Keeffe’s paintings of greatly enlarged flowers appeared in 1924. To many people, the swelling forms and mysterious dark voids bore unmistakably sexual overtones, and any number of critics in discussing them made heavy use of Freud. O’Keeffe was offended. She had painted the flower image big, she later wrote, so that people would “be surprised into taking time to look at it” and would then perhaps see it as she did, in all its miraculous shape, color, and texture. “Well,” O’Keeffe wrote, “I made you take time to look at what I saw, and when you took time to really notice my flower **you hung all your own associations with flowers on my flower**, and you write about my flower as if I think and see what you think and see of the flower—and I don’t.”

I’ll take a hundred shots, go home and edit maybe 3 of them into something I’m happy with.

To me, one of the most frustrating kinds of person is the idiot that buys a $1,000 DSLR, and a bunch of top of the line equipment, plays with it for maybe a month. Never learns anything about photography or how to use it. Busts it out at birthdays and on vacation to take shots that would come out *muuch* better with their phone. Then one day decides to take a paying photography job and mucks it up

I’d give anything for a D/SLR camera, I don’t have that kinda disposable income. I like it, and it’s annoying to me to think of exactly how many cameras are being wasted.

Same goes for people who drop a lot of money on a brand new hobby. The loss of interest isn’t what annoys me. The investments not the problem it’s that now that stuffs just junk in people’s homes. There’s so many kids passionate about so much *stuff* and all the equipment they need is probably forgotten in a neighborhood basement picking up dust. (That goes triple for musical instruments). 

In HS I was crazy into computers, and we didn’t have any money for that kinda thing. I remember a friends grams gave me one when she heard me talking about it, because it had been junk. It didn’t work, but I started asking everyone for broken computers and had myself a working one in short order. Went to college for computer stuff and was way ahead of the curve because of my experience from a young age with fixing computers. Then I fucked my life up but that’s irrelevant ;)"

It’s good because say you wanna run something like Plex, well that needs a whole operating system to run on.

TooAfraidToAsk,fd71jpj,t1_fd54kvz,1578198306.0,"So I was able to pick up like who was who, but sometimes I’d zone out because I wouldn’t understand why a scene was important to the larger narrative.

For example and this may be kinda spoiler-ey, if I was reading Dune I’d be able to follow each scene and understand who’s who at a surface level. What I’d have trouble with is understanding the stakes at the end of the first book when the good guy fights the bad guy. Dunes a good example because a lot of the book is about how the “good guys” are working to improve the planets ecology, to improve the desert planet into a paradise - the bad guys are just into increasing their own power/wealth, by standing on the people under them. I’d have a hard time keeping track of the planet ecology stuff, and just be enjoying each scene but not seeing how they fit together. The first time I read dune I had missed an entire sub-plot and had no idea why certain characters were showing up at the end - it seemed like chaos.

For books that have cliffhanger chapters that change POV, just imagine taking out all the chapters for the characters you find “boring.” I’d read them, but not retain a lot.

It’s hard to explain very well, mainly because it was so long ago. 

I had 3 main problems

1.	I was reading stuff I wasn’t into really
2.	I was reading a little above my level
3.	I was reading too quickly 

The first two go hand in hand, I’ve never liked young adult, but was too young to know how to pick a good book.

So my advice would be, either go to a library, bookstore, or learn about book piracy and don’t be afraid to try new books. Try ones you’ve never heard of, and try the ones everyone talks about. BUT stop reading if your not into it, figure out how to tell when your not in the mood for that genre, when you don’t like a writers style, or when you just don’t have the focus. There’s nothing wrong with reading in 10-15 minute bursts.


I’m not sure who said it but there’s a quote in the literary world that’s like:

>a book worth reading, is worth reading twice

Or more than once. Give books a shot, don’t quit too fast, but ask yourself “would I read this again?” That’s a good way to know if you should try something else, you can always come back if you find yourself thinking about it.

TooAfraidToAsk,fd2gqyw,t3_ejrgje,1578146984.0,"It was a bigger problem when I was younger, in my teens to early 20s.

I’ve loved reading since about the 2nd grade. I was reading at a college level by high school. Usually I could give a summary of a chapter, but never the whole book

After I graduated I was diagnosed with ADHD and got on meds. Suddenly I was comprehending books, like really taking in the story. Suddenly I could read Frankenstein and Moby Dick and understand the language, at the time the barrier for me was Neal Stephenson books, I couldn’t take in more than a page. Idk why I tried reading cryptonomicon again, but that’s when I realized I was reading with a clear head.

I had basically been experiencing books as a series of disjointed vignettes and thinking that was normal.

Now, from time to time, my mind wanders and I realize I haven’t caught anything so I go back a bit. I was only medicated for a year or two. I think I re-learned how to read / my brain was re-wired in a fundamental way. I still have ADHD, and it’s bad sometimes, but I comprehend AND analyze what I read now.

If you want a suggestion it’s read slower, don’t worry about going back. I had a friend who would spend ages on each page, and he explained he was looking at each sentence and looking for deeper meanings and junk. Or he just thought a certain section was pretty/well written.

Reading comprehension is a skill that’s a little separate from the ability to read. It’s a thing we have to work at.

Coming out of HS our conclusion might be “the slow kids read badly” but as an adult I think it’s just impatient people who read quickly. (This is if we’re talking about reading for fun, mainly.)"

Like think about that, it’s midnight and you hear an explosion. It’s a neighbors house. People start coming outside because a house just exploded. You can hear, maybe a kid screaming and crying for help, but no one moves because you all know there’s a second strike coming. 

With your whole street you watch the second bomb hit a little bit later. Then people start, hesitantly moving to help. The kids quiet now.

Maybe his dad was a terrorist leader... maybe... but that kid wasn’t. With that one strike we’ve pushed every person in that area into our “enemies” cause. Because they’re gonna be mad. Think of all the idiot 18-24 year olds signing up after 9/11. We know the psychological impact our strikes have. We know they push people to want to act against us.

The problem with our presidents is the same as it is with our ruling class. They are so far removed from the average persons version of reality that we are no longer people to them.

When it comes to throwing money at climate change you have to do homework first. Like who do you even donate to? Then you have to figure out if it’s like one of those trump non profits that are actually just run by scummy people.

Most of the notre dame money came from corps, and the ludicrously wealthy. Unfortunately at this point, either we need to restructure our global civ to put a stop to the massive corps that are killing us, or we need to find some way to make them start taking steps to fix it.

I’m not optimistic Either way

But fuck it, let’s just repost this stupid image that acknowledges a problem but doesn’t come close to suggesting a solution. At least that’s doing *something.* maybe we can do a trash tag too, and ignore that corps are the biggest polluters by such a wide margin that the rest of human civilization doesn’t even show up on the graph. I mean, we could stop buying iPhones and video games. We could, as a civ, decide just not to buy anything that isn’t an immediate survival need until shit starts getting fixed. I feel like, since we managed fine without modern stuff until like 50 years ago we’ll be fine. Especially with all the stuff we have, like what if we shared instead of throwing things out? What if we took the time to make sure that old laptop we’ve not turned on for 5 years wasn’t needed by any of our neighbors?

I think the corps are doing a divide and conquer thing, kinda subconsciously for sure, no CEO sayin we need to make sure these people don’t know their neighbors. They just keep giving us so many cookies we can’t be bothered to look up.

We’re isolating ourselves, and becoming more and more insulted in our own niche communities. The internet’s great for things like that, but it’s a double edge when you’re using those online spaces to the exclusion of all else. It’s a problem when we’re afraid of our neighbors. It’s a problem when we can’t stand up together against the tyranny of the ruling classes.

We all agree that climate change is a big deal, but we haven’t the power. Our system for organizing anything is entirely controlled by the people ruining the world, they own it and they control what we see on it. Again, it’s not in a direct way, it’s just, there’s no profit in commercials explaining how to save the planet or fix democracy.

I think what we need is a communally owned server, running something like Facebook or reddit. But when towns or groups try to set up their own networks the powers that be get real nervous.


https://www.citylab.com/solutions/2013/03/why-are-there-no-big-cities-municipal-broadband-networks/4857/

The red states on that map, have passed laws specifically blocking towns from providing their own internet.

To be clear, communication networks aren’t some private thing. They’re companies that are supposed to be competing because capitalism... except for some reason no ones allowed to compete. It’s the most chilling thing in the world, our ability to exchange ideas is slowly being strangled.
