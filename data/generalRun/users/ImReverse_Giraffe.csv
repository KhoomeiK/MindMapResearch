Kings Island is much more likely to get the RMC T-Rex when its finally ready or a 4D coaster over a free standing RMC hybrid. 

Since Cedar Fair bought Kings Island they have added in three B&M coasters and a GCI. Also they have I believe only three RMC's in all of their parks.

If weed was legal like alcohol it would result in remarkable fewer deaths than alcohol does every year.  If you're going to go after weed, go after alcohol first it so much worse. 


It's almost impossible to die from the effect of weed or from OD'ing on weed. Can you die from what you do on it, sure? But if you're put in a empty room there is no amount of weed you can reasonably smoke and kill yourself. It would take way too much in way too short of a time.

It's almost impossible to die from the effect of weed or from OD'ing on weed. Can you die from what you do on it, sure? But if you're put in a empty room there is no amount of weed you can reasonably smoke and kill yourself. It would take way too much in way too short of a time.
