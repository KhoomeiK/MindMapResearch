mypartneristrans,fezv76g,t1_fezu117,1579462082.0,"Thank you.  Unfortunately, my experience with some of my own family has taught me that the sort of people who stab you in the back will only ever regret not stabbing you twice."
mypartneristrans,fezuqdc,t1_fewjbm4,1579461910.0,"Amen.  Or that hate means support, or that having an issue with one person who happens to be part of one group means you hate *all* people in that group.  Yeah.  It’s a damn slog."
mypartneristrans,fezugqh,t1_fez8jir,1579461806.0,"There is no way in hell I’d let Reddit know her actual name, but I’ve called her Paula here before and that’s what the name references.  So, kinda/sorta?"
mypartneristrans,fewdamn,t1_fewboc1,1579408696.0,"Thank you.  In many ways, this divorce was the kindest thing she could have done for me, but that’s not saying much because it was and is a hurtful and petty thing to do it the way she’s doing it.

Armchair psychology always feels a little gross to me, but I think there definitely might be some pent-up bitterness on her part at having to “settle” for marrying a woman and present as masculine for so long.  We had to burn, literally burn, our wedding album because she hated seeing pictures of her past self in a tux *that* much.  It’s something I can understand and empathize with, but it’s also, like, not my fault—it’s nobody’s fault—and it doesn’t excuse what she’s done or how she’s done it."

You’re, and about a third of the people here on this nominally tolerant subreddit, are putting me in a position where *I have to defend the biggest asshole in my life*.
