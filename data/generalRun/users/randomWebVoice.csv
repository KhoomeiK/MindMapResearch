I feel like this *gotta* be some kind of satire

Edit: Found it!

>This is a danish comedy show where the host Huxi Bach goes through things happening in the danish society (like last week tonight with John Oliver). This episode aired last night on DR1 (danish tv station), and the skit is about our nation receiving some pandas from the Chinese government and how we indirectly support their regime through the decision to receive them. The Girl Scouts sing a song the show wrote where they sarcastically praise some of the things China does that violates human rights etc.

>The mood is very Hitler Jugend, and the reference is probably not a coincidence, but the salute is just as the show ends, and I think what people say regarding it being a mistake on the girls side is probably true since it was about China and right at the end of the show.

>It probably takes a danish proxy, but here is the link to the episode:
