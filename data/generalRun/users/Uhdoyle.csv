explainlikeimfive,fe1dxol,t1_fe0z3ey,1578825494.0,"Look at any shiny curved surface, like a curved monitor. Shine some light at it. No matter what angle you look at it from, you’ll see a reflection of some light. Now look at a flat monitor and shine a light at it. You’ll see that there are many angles from which there are no direct reflections back at you. That’s a big part of how those angled surfaces help stealth."

ReelToReel,fcuvcuq,t3_ej1j3u,1577989302.0,"For backwards recording, put a length of tape onto the take up reel then put that take up reel on the supply side but literally backwards and record to it. Now take your reverse recorded reel back on the supply side and play it back. The track numbers will be reversed when you record the backwards part.

Tape delay works because the playback head is some distance after the record head, so if you record to and play back from the same track simultaneously you get that delay effect. https://youtu.be/hTbBR7SJ_44"

I’m just listening to my iPhone speaker though, can’t really tell. There seem to be at least three voices saying the numbers and occasionally some get more emphasis than others. I’ll have to take a close listen when I get home."
MechanicAdvice,fc6hv8c,t1_fc6fi2c,1577480944.0,"Yeah get you a new crush washer and try that out on the drain plug first. Actually, clean up your block as much as you can, wait a bit, and re-examine for the leak source. 

I replaced my oil pan for the first time this summer on a 2005 Volvo S40. It wasn’t nearly as difficult as I’d anticipated. Hardest part for me was the AC compressor is bolted right to the pan so I had to support it with an extra jack and work around that. You can do it, just study up before hand with online resources and make sure you have the right tools (particularly a torque wrench).

I’m about to do my inner/outer tie rods for the first time. Because of the tight space I’m scared I’ll get something removed and be unable to get proper torque when putting the new inner tie rod on. Oh well, if I get stuck I’ll have to pay an extra $70 for a tow to a shop."
