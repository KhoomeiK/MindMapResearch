ScienceLaboratory,feslkyk,t1_fes48fi,1579366501.0,"I only eat red meat once ever few months or so, my wife doesn't eat it at all! We also source any meat that we buy from local places that give their animals a good life"
ScienceLaboratory,feslaev,t1_fesjqjw,1579366411.0,"I get the point of the video, I'm not a huge fan of it, but I *have* had to slaughter chickens and been there when they slaughtered a cow so we could eat. 

Pigs are as smart as dogs, cows are more like gigantic mice, chickens are more like fish. 

Now, I *always* source the meat that I do buy these days from local places, that give the animals good conditions throughout their life. 

Unless it's fish\ seafood which we try and do research on the company and the product chain before we buy it. 


Maybe I'm missing the point, but there *are* more things we can do besides straight up not eating all meat or meat products, and getting more people on board with *NOT* giving money to **any** factory farms is step 1"
