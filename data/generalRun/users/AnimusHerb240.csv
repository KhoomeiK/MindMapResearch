samharris,ff4gjvo,t3_erjtlc,1579563082.0,"In the past few years, alcohol's most noticeable side effects shifted from physical to mental/emotional. It took a while and it took a few reminders from other people in my life to finally put two and two together, but going cold turkey was easy once I really noticed how consistently drinking was causing drastic dips in mood.

I was drinking 4 nights a week on average. I was constantly lobbying for dinner venues where I knew I could get what I liked to drink if there were several suggestions up in the air, and I couldn't go grocery shopping without getting something for the fridge. After enough of these conversations went down, it was hard to deny it: ""Are you okay?"" ""I dunno I just feel so off today, like really in the dumps, so I'm just trying to distract myself or stay positive, ugh"" ""Did you happen to drink last night?"" ""...hmm...yep""

Not everybody's chemistry is the same, but I just started thinking of it as suicide juice and it organically became an easy ""No Thanks"". I'm not exactly all sunshine and roses off the stuff, but the difference is extremely noticeable to myself and my peers and I'm glad I made the shift. Special thanks to the \#SoberOctober crowd for helping reset the clock with some solid control data.

As for the moment-to-moment dilemma of following the impulse to dose up on something to numb/dull the doldrums of the daily grind, I specifically shifted my meditation practice from ""focus on breath"" to ""focus on mantra"" so I would have a few sayings on-hand to repeat in my head for emergency fire control...I am still in the process of solidifying this as a healthier habit in lieu of getting lost in thought and muttering a string of curses as I ruminate."

Arguably if you could rig the machine to constantly provide you with things to make you happy, eventually a flavor of dissatisfaction would arise due to the inherent shallow nature of happiness vs fulfillment. For me, it is not enough to simply make a paycheck and get my ducks in a row...I am here to slay dragons. As for getting on the right path, I am a big fan of yoga, not the bodily-poses-on-gym-mats yoga but rather the non-physical ones that are for honing attention, focus, will, and solidly rooting one's identity apart from the circumstantial.

samharris,fc6oj6r,t1_fc5l67v,1577485518.0,"My point is, it is folly to lay disproportionate outrage against Trump without adequate understanding of the decades of failed policies that set the stage for his ascension, especially when that outrage manifests as a lashing out that achieves nothing toward the amelioration of the catastrophe in place. There is a strategic state of affairs ripe for acting upon, but Trump's impeachment is playing at ""politics"" or playing an ""emotional game"" when there are actual fires to put out that demand policy toward aggressive reform. Especially considering its obvious doomed trajectory from the get-go, Trump's attempted impeachment is just a poor strategic play -- it doesn't address stagnating wages, or a broken education system, or a failed war on drugs, or the profit motive within the healthcare system, or the profit motive in the prison system, or the school-to-prison pipeline, or the eroding of workers' rights, or eroding civil liberties, or predatory banking and Wall Street speculation, or endless wars in the Middle East, or participating in coups to undermine foreign governments, or setting targets for climate concerns, or children in cages, or a potentially compromised voting apparatus. Trump's attempted impeachment is **purely emotional feelgoods through bureaucratic gestures** that take up time and energy that could be better spent directly addressing these problems which have been brewing long before he even declared his candidacy.

I refer to initial excerpt from article:

> to the extent that investigating Trump’s scandalous behavior allows Democrats to discredit Trump without undergoing revolutionary internal changes, it is counterproductive.

To the extent that Biden and other moderates' wishes have been expressed as ""return to _____"" -- whether that is return to ""normalcy"", return to ""Obama Golden Age"", or an agenda that is limited merely to rolling back Trump's clumsy disturbances and patching up what was in place, or a campaign message that is ""I am not Trump, and that's enough"" -- they are really aiming for ""return to catastrophe"". Functionally, the difference between a neoliberal administration vs a Trump administration is the difference between less obvious catastrophe hidden with a nice mask vs obvious catastrophe with no mask...which is more dangerous?"
