I’m reading some stuff into one conversation btwn Han and Leia.  Yes he was a poor father and absentee but I don’t get the feeling that he was the kind of deadbeat dad that a character assassination Implys. 

In the OT he could be quite Juvenile his attempts at expressing his feelings for Leia, even right up till his final lines of RotJ.  I don’t think it’s unbelievable that they might have future relationship problems and he might not be a great father.  He’s not a bad person just for having flaws.


> Are we to believe that Luke would go incommunicado for *years*, at a time when an evil dark Force was rising in the galaxy? 

Yoda and Kenobi did.  I always felt there was more ritual to when and how Jedi must fight.  Yoda urged Luke to finish his training and not chase after his friends.  Vader knew Obi-wan had no intention to escape the Death Star and that he must face him in single combat.  Luke himself abandons the military mission in RotJ to confront Vader and the Emperor alone. 

There could certainly be a ‘why’ for Luke to be there.  TFA offers a search for a Jedi temple as a partial answer.  This could lead you to believe there is something there, some bit of ancient wisdom Luke will need to master to face rising dark forces.

And Luke isn't present but it's not spelled out what he's doing.  The characters believe once they find him he'll return and help.  Again its TLJ that decides Luke is cowardly, in TFA for all we know he's doing something important.

While TFA doesn't paint Han as a particularly good father it doesn't have him as regressed until after he and Leia lost their son to Snoke.

You can't just Slap the label *Star Wars* on something and have it mean it'll be anything like what someone loves and remembers from seeing before.

Put it in Sports terms:  Why can't every Browns fan just appreciate everything The Browns?  Stop talking about how what's going on now isn't as good as Paul Brown, Otto Graham, Jim Brown, or Bernie Kosar.  

Why don't all Browns fans just love every Left Tackle, both Joe Thomas and Greg Robinson why not love them the same? Its so annoying how people are always arguing about who the QB or Head Coach should be.

You just aren't a true fan if you weren't cheering, happy, and buying merchandise as the team went 0-16"

saltierthancrait,femxy9y,t1_femfop8,1579272486.0,"They absolutely should've been working off the EU from the getgo but they can't just pluck some character never before mentioned in the movies and throw him in as a main antagonist in at the end of the trilogy.

That would leave them with Palpatine reborn or Darth Plagueis reborn as the decent only options.  Every character that could've served as a pre-established (in film) antagonist is dead.

Plagueis was never shown on screen dying, perhaps we could learn his immortally work was successful and Palpatine had only thought him dead..  which just introduces some of the same problems...  and with him being a pretty unrecognizable character, only mentioned in one scene, not surprising they didn't go that direction.

I get why they went with Palpatine instead of a sudden new never before mentioned extra Sith.  Neither is good but I don't blame IX itself for the problem, I blame RJ, KK, and TLJ.

Maybe TLJ fans would've like Trevorrow's script version but I would have left the theater seething mad.  

JJ's TRoS surpassed my (very low) expectations for it, a lot of the issues with the movie are things you knew you'd be getting with JJ back so it's not like they were a surprise to me.  (I was actually Impressed with how well they were able to work Leia into the movie)


The alleged Trevorrow script seems like an overall better put together movie but it doubles down on themes and lore that I hated in TLJ, particularly right at the end.  I would've been so ticked off."

  I don't mind most of the added stuff from the '97 special edition.  Though back when I was watching that I had the choice each time to watch the 'original' version in the same quality. The idea that there would be no new official releases of the 'original' versions is insane.

The changes I hate the most are the ones made after the prequels to try to fix some of the continuity errors with the prequels.  Inserts  of Gungans in RotJ, Changing the Emperor's and Vader's dialogue in ESB, Vader's NOOOO, Inserting Hayden Christensen into RotJ,"

saltierthancrait,fea2lrs,t1_fe9kqop,1578943763.0,"Watto's interest in the race was 3-way

**Initial proposal:** Split of the winnings with Qui-gon.  Qui-gon supplies his (actually Ani's) pod and entry fee, Watto supplies the slave driver (Ani)

**1st bet/agreement:** Watto and Qui-gon modify this proposal to a 50/50 split with Watto supplying the upfront entry fee but include a bet on whether or not they take fist place. If they win the race Watto gets 100% but gives ship up parts, if they lose then Qui-gon loses the ship.

This agreement is a win/win for him since he believes Ani has the skills to do well and Watto gets a share of winnings.  He doesn't expect him to place first though so he's expecting extra value of winning Qui-gon's ship as well.

**Second bet:** A second bet on whether or not they take first place, Watto bet's ownership of his slave (Ani) vs ownership of Qui-gon's Podracer.  

**Other bets:** What really hurts him later is that he had lots of other bets based on expecting Sebulba to win.  His deals with Qui-gon were possibly still a net positive for him.  He payed the entry fee, lost Hyperdrive parts, and lost Anakin but he did keep 100% of the first place prize money.

Watto wants and expects Anakin to do well, supplying a skilled slave pilot his primary contribution to his and Qui-gon's joint venture.  Best case scenario for Watto is Anakin taking 2nd place. 
 He also had Anakin pilot a pod for him in a race prior to the events of the movie.

It still all leaves a big hole as to why Anakin would ever have been given the chance to race pods to find out he was good at it."
