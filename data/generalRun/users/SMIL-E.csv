ENFP,ff1eo15,t1_ff1dzlu,1579478242.0,"INTJs are notorious for trying to hide emotions and maybe even suppressing them so maybe he was afraid of getting too involved with you or getting hurt? IMO you shouldn't really worry about the astrology side of things I think but as they say do as you like, just maybe try to make sure that you don't limit your options for relationships just because of what time someone was born perhaps (No offense btw I don't really know too much about astrology except that fact that I don't believe in horoscopes)"
ENFP,ff1dupt,t1_ff1dc88,1579477915.0,"Curious about how you know he was INTJ. Did he tell you or did you just guess? Sorry to hear that btw, just a bad apple in the bunch I guess, I'm sure that you know that not all INTJs are like that (one of my favourite INTJs is Elon Musk)."
ENFP,ff1cnms,t3_er482l,1579477519.0,Best types are said to be INFJ or INTJ. If you talk to one of these types long enough you'll see why.
depression,fetd6td,t3_eq82ox,1579374115.0,Wind's howling...
infp,fdtgy3t,t1_fdtga8m,1578716604.0,Thank you so much for the replies. You've been very helpful in helping me understand more about how INFPs go about potential relationships. As an ENFP I do think I have a talent for reading the way people are feeling in any given time so I'll trust my gut on this one and not give up on this girl because she's great.
infp,fdtfowf,t1_fdtdyrh,1578716093.0,"Also I have asked her out once before and I have a feeling that she rejected me because she might be scared of messing up or just on general having a relationship with me. She has had a bad past relationship 2 years ago and she says that she distances herself from guys that get too close (She has also said that she has low self-esteem). She said that I'm a great guy though. 

Is it plausible that she likes me but is scared to have a relationship with me? Or is it just that she tried to let me down gently with the ""you have the best personality""  and ""you are too good for a relationship"" talk? Should I even try to do little advances with her anymore or should I just keep it friendly now since I do like her as a person and I enjoy her company.

She seems a little more awkward at least when we start the conversation but once we get into it it goes nicely."
infp,fdtem11,t1_fdtdyrh,1578715651.0,"I mean I have touched her like on the arm or shoulder a few times and she did it back of that counts in terms of physical advances, sometimes she touched me on her own first but this has happened rarely. I haven't tried to kiss her yet cause I'm still definitely unsure about it that would go well. It seems like INFPs can be quite confusing so I'm unsure if that means anything."
infp,fdtcus7,t1_fdtcg1x,1578714950.0,What does it mean if an INFP girl is quite vulnerable with me after only a short while since  knowing each other? Vulnerable in terms of telling me about her life and some of her struggles. Is there others ways to be vulnerable?
infp,fdtbazu,t1_fdtatdm,1578714349.0,Yeah I get that tbh. What makes you trust someone to be vulnerable with them though? Is it just a trust thing?
infp,fdt83d5,t1_fdt7xb6,1578713152.0,Why though!??! Don't you like him? I feel like this might be happening to me lol.
infp,fdt1ulj,t1_fds0by0,1578710829.0,How do you feel if the person you like starts making moves on you though?
ENFP,fdnfltp,t1_fdnbbgs,1578584766.0,"Yeah it's definitely a specialty we have as ENFPs to be able to read the emotional energy in people. The choice to share or not is I would say is really important to let the person know that they can trust you, you aren't prodding them too hard by asking one more time and it shows actual concern and that you aren't expecting a stupid ""I'm fine"" canned response as many people nowadays say. My close friends are also introverts."
2meirl4meirl,fdlu3rl,t1_fdlto97,1578532527.0,That's awesome! I'm happy that your friendship is working out and good job at taking the initiative. I also wish you long and happy friendship with all of your friends.
depression,fdlndq3,t1_fdln8db,1578527958.0,Thanks for the advice. I'll try the counselling one more time for sure.
2meirl4meirl,fdligff,t1_fdli1ek,1578524728.0,Thanks for the advice! However I've already solved the issue which is good.
depression,fdlg056,t1_fdlf7rj,1578523213.0,Yeah I can definitely relate. My depression seems to come in episodes and whilst in them I feel completely hopeless. My energy is drained and everything is meaningless. I guess I'm lucky to still have times where I do feel nearly happy. Even I become convinced that no one actually likes me and secretly wants to avoid me.
2meirl4meirl,fdl572x,t3_elw8k9,1578517236.0,Literally might've just done that a few minutes ago. FML man I'm so mad that I'm this stupid.
depression,fdkle5k,t3_elvipt,1578505960.0,"I'm sorry you feel this way OP. A lot of the things that you hate about yourself you can improve by taking baby steps. Improvement comes from consistent effort but I know that depression makes us have no energy. Find your passions, it can literally be anything; anything that you can do that will keep you entertained and something that you can constantly improve on. Sex isn't all that great I'll be honest, when you do it with someone who doesn't actually mean anything to you the feelings just aren't there... You may feel something in the moment but it's fake. I had sex when I was very young and I feel no different now... I still would like one day to have a girlfriend. Someone to actually connect with deeply. That's not to say that I don't get attention from girls, it's that I simply already know that we wouldn't work. The one that I did like rejected me unfortunately. The ""girls want bad guys"" is not true. The truth is that bad guys display attributes that girls like (confidence, assertiveness ect...) and they can't help being attracted to that. We as nice guys can also be have those attributes and not be assholes but it can't be faked. We need to get real confidence by believing in ourselves and seeing our worth. We can build it by working on ourselves and making us not hate ourselves. Go to the gym and start exercising if you can muster the energy (starving yourself won't help in the long run). Start learning things and expanding your mind (philosophy is my personal favourite). If you just do things for yourself and build yourself up girls will start flocking to you naturally and you will have an abundance to choose from since they would be the lucky ones to have you and not the other way around. Don't worry about the lack of sexual experience btw, a girl worth being with definitely wouldn't mind teaching you. Sorry for the long reply and I know that I'm just some 17 year old kid on reddit and you don't need to take my advice if you don't want to. I hope something here resonates with you though."
depression,fdkid5g,t1_fdkhlu0,1578504436.0,"Yeah definitely is a shock I can't even imagine. Such a sudden thing out of nowhere. Thanks for the reply btw, really comes to show that the people who you wouldn't think would care if you left actually do."
depression,fdkh9tp,t3_eluknb,1578503850.0,I hope this is ok to ask... Just out of curiosity did you know this girl personally or was she just someone you saw around college?
