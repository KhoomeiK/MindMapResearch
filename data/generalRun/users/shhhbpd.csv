BipolarReddit,ffbmeau,t1_ffbev50,1579772553.0,"Dude. This is what’s mindfucking me. I was a stripper from 18-22, then fell super ill for 2 years. Now I’m diagnosed, on meds (but I think on my manic cycle still) and am super interested in pursuing full service sex work because I can work for myself plus I’m horny all the time: I’m not trying to sound ignorant, I know it’s not the only thing by a long shot required to make it safely in the industry.... but safely is what concerns me.

However.... bipolar can be so heartbreaking that I feel like why the fuck not play up some of the more “enjoyable” symptoms like my raging hyper sexuality.

Part of me is also like.... shit what if im only hypersexual to avoid processing pain and my giant emotions

Then the nihilist in me is like NOTHING MEANS ANYTHING CHILL

sorry I’m newly diagnosed and soooo confused."
