You however cant do much with no fleet whatsoever.

The germans also lost half their destroyer fleet several support ships and a heavy battleship. This was enough to cripple the German fleet so extensively it never really did any major operations bar a few again. This focus on high seas fleet also severely fucked their uboat program which would be behind the entirety of war.

The invasion of france was also necessary and in fact im pretty sure i didnt pain it as a bad thing. I said it was a bold plan that aided the Germans but it also gives the impression to some people in the modern day that the Germans were an unstoppable powerhouse and that only a few chance things led to their demise. That isnt the case at all, with hindsight we know there wasnt really anything the germans could have done to conclusively won.

Hitler is seen a tactical strategists because he was fond of bold decisive options and early on that worked well for the Germans considering the allies total failure to coordinate and adapt, but each of these attacks further weakened an already doomed German state.

HistoryMemes,fgjslgo,t1_fgjnaab,1580850577.0,"It's already been said but part of me cant resist. The question around the Holodomar is generally broken into 3 categories of historical opinion
- Was it the soviets fault? The first and main one that is rather complex because though you could argue the soviets failure to implement functional agrarian policy due to corruption and stalins ineptitute did exasperate the problem id argue the roots of the famine had their core in uncontrollable issues with the Russian Agrarian society which had cropped up for decades

- Was it a targetted genocide? This one is also controversial but unlike famines like the irish potato famine which id argue is a genocide it seems the regimes targetting of wealthy peasantry and grain redistribution policies only hit the Ukrainians hardest because they were the grain basket of Europe. Now the bit i would say gives merit to it being a genocide is Stalins unwilligness to aid the Ukrainians partly because they were Ukrainian

And the third one that doesnt really relate to the question exactly right now but was the Soviet ideology at fault or rather a fault of regime.

This as opposed to Nanking which was undisputably the home of one of many massacres and mass rapes carried out on the terms of racial supremacy. Acts like these and the holocaust are in my eyes more immoral then the acts carried out in the Holodomar regardless of the death toll of the latter due to both the intent behind such policies and the societal engagement"

europe,fgfe3dt,t1_fgfd3w5,1580735970.0,"Oh boy somebody knows a vague list of logical fallacies. Everybody who wants to deny evidence's favourite appeal to authority

The appeal to authority logical fallacy however contrary to popular belief is not a fallacy because one simply referenced experts work as reasoning behind belief, in fact the appeal to authority fallacy only applies in 2 situations, 
1) the authority in question being cited has no basis behind agreeing with you and would be the equivalent to i dunno someone like elon musk saying steel is weaker then cardboard out of the blue and me going well if elon musk said it, it must be true. If said authority actually has scientific data behind his claims or studied said thing, citing him or general theory around it is not an appeal to authority, its a citing of experts and is not a logical fallacy. Ie saying the theory of evolution is obviously real many scientists agree and have studied the topic extensively, the claim im makinf is being supported by the fact that several experts believe in it but not proven
2) if the evidence you are bringing up successfully contradicts the expertise info being cited, ie if you gave me a statistical data proving my claims wrong from reliable sources i couldnt just say well my economists disagree therefore im right, that would also be an appeal to authority fallacy

The appeal to authority falacy is inherently surface level and is not even close to being bullshit, thats not how the fallacy works and believing so shows that you dont have a fuckin clue what you are talking about.

I stated economists study this which is true and i rely on their research over your random internet crap which is not an appeal to authority fallacy, it literally is just expertise, if that was an appeal to authority fallacy then being an expert inherently makes you less reliable in your eyes.

They may have joined late but they were forced into the war very early on and many greeks died both to war but also to civil unrest, entente supression, disease spread that the entente armies brought with them and a plethora of other things.

However what the guy seems to miss is the Entente doing bad things doesnt miraculously make the Central Powers good, on top of that though admittedly awful the Central Powers occupation of Belgium compared to the occupation of Greece is DRASTICALLY different, many more belgians died, there government was pushed out completely, they were given no independence and well the rape of Belgium is a well documented thing"

The government that said that is the current Spanish government, the old governments peoples party im pretty sure has also agreed to not veto Scotland which was the previous government but the current government 100% is behind not vetoing the Scottish.

I dont think some people understand how the Catalonia situation escalated, the reason the Spanish considered it illegal is because the catalonian government just declared it and held it, the Spanish obviously dont want to have Catalonia gain independence but it doesn't mean they are against the concept of independence by any nation ever especially in the UK which is already a very divided nation in the first place unlike Spain's national setup"

Ironically when the Scottish had their last referendum one of the biggest reasons if not the absolute biggest reason cited for choosing to remain was membership in the EU, considering that is no longer an option i feel the people are well within their right to vote again. If you don't want to leave you can still vote no you don't magically lose that power when a second referendum is held, better yet you can vote a party whos core policy doesnt revolve around Scottish independence and if they don't win you won't have to worry about it.

Of course at the end of the day it is the people's will and democracy is based on the idea that people are able to change their mind, if it were all set in stone the British would still be part of the EU, after all they wanted in initially, why should they have the right to change their mind"

gifs,fg664mv,t1_fg63j3b,1580555616.0,Spain will not veto Scotland. The reason the Spanish diplomat was fired was because he published the response about Spain refusing to veto Scotland in order to discredit a claim that the center right party would veto it if voted in. This was considered a domestic political influential issue and therefore he was fired for interfering. The Spanish however have reiterated they would not veto Scotland joining repeatedly with all major parties provided they gain independence legally

For example if you get a 99 Atar you are in the top 1% of the state. Your atar is derived from your subjects study scores, more important it is derived from 1 english subject and your 3 top subjects plus 10% of your next 2 highest subjects, because of this most people only do 6 vce subjects.

Study scores are derived from your sacs and end of year exam. These splits are generally 50% from your sacs (25% for each unit) and 50% from your exams although this does change depending on the subject. Your final score is scored like this, Your SAC and Exam scores directly correlate to a rank you gain in class meaning if everyone in your school doing your class does really well you get a bonus, that's why working together is a good idea.

Ahh what else to cover, Atar isnt really that important as it only covers initial placements so you can easily transfer in most cases and that's basically the gist"

todayilearned,ffzmrgs,t1_ffzfnsg,1580386259.0,"The reason I tell you to look at his writings is they are very often taken out of context and done to an amazing degree to make Columbus look bad because people like a good black and white story in history, rarely is that the case. For example Columbus is often quoted as saying this alone “there are many dealers who go about looking for girls; those from nine to 10 are now in demand.” to show support of the sex trade that cropped up. Though i don't have the exact wording i know for a fact that is a quote from a literal complain that Columbus made to the monarch of Spain about the Spanish colonists. He would then be sent back to Spain for cutting off the hands of Spanish settlers for their crimes many of which included the sexual assault present. 

Similarly he never was responsible for the genocide of the taino. The genocide of the taino was carried out for many years much of which Columbus wasnt even in fucking charge he was an explorer and governed Hispaniola for less time the  people think. He also didnt write they would make good slaves a common quote associated with him. That is a mistranslation of when he said they would make good servants of god, translations are quite key to understanding the dude.

Amerigo and Columbus both were instrumental in the exploration of South America, that's just a literal fact Columbus slightly more so because Amerigo made up parts of his expeditions. There is a reason why both continents were largely called Columbia and America for many many many years, they were both essential explorers. Columbus went to south America before the Reis map you are referencing too in his 4th expedition i think."

Columbus was never a great man but he also wasnt a power hungry gold loving despot and he also never advocated for or carried out any genocide of the native populace, a conquest of sorts sure he was a part of it and his arrival did precipitate the diseases of the old world massacring the new world populace but a sad fact of history is those diseases were inevitable. It sounds awful but barely a few hundred years early a third of Europe was wiped out, these horrific pandemics were a inevitable occurrence in the growth of global connections.

The people who came after Columbus were significantly worse by like a lot.

Also very few people claim he stepped on north and south America (actually I thought he did in South America but i know he travelled along its coast all the same) the Americas are the 2 continents including the carribean which he did discover again from the European side regardless of whether he stepped into north or south America"
todayilearned,ffz4afv,t1_ffxjkvf,1580363487.0,"That's not actually accurate though Columbus was off he wasnt off by a significant amount he just believed it was a bit smaller, what he really believed was that Asia was fucking massive because many map makers thought so. The real reason he wasnt funded was because he relied on untested maps by admittedly one of the most prestigious map makers of the time and had to land on unconfirmed Japanese islands (which they thought stretched off) and it was a gamble for a Portuguese king who didn't like Columbus and thought he was an untested captain (especially since they already ykno had the African route they were working on) 

The Spanish however decided to risk it and here we reach a second myth Columbus didnt think he found India, in fact he knew he found something new almost immediately, admittedly he thoughr he was somewhere off the coast of Japan because again the best map makers of the time thought Asia was much much MUCH bigger, he very quickly concluded this was something new entirely.

He also didnt start the triangle slave trade, didnt advocate for native child prostitution (In fact he faced jail time for opposing it and cutting off Spanish colonists hands) was actually a relatively peaceful governor and although with his faults was one of the best colonial governors Spain ever offered."

HistoryMemes,ffqe4vr,t1_ffqcbn8,1580131849.0,"ive said this above but also wanna clarify some things here specifically, they did come to Polands aid exactly the way the Polish military command expected, the Allies were unable to supply the Polish nor was the idea of total land invasion seen by any of the combined militaries as an acceptable thing especially in the first month where most forces were mobilizing and preparing. This is key to know because the Polish were not expected to hold out both as long as they did nor just as a general war goal, that was well know by all parties involved and Polands future safety relied on the preservation of the Allied lines which relied on the low countries, this is key to know because Belgium had declared neutrality much earlier and forced French troops off their land meaning the allied defense plans were heavily reliant on being ready to push into Belgium when the Germans inevitably did.  


To invade Germany with the forces they expected to face would be suicide, the air warfare is the only real facet where this is true but bombing runs would not have prevented the invasion of Poland and its subsequent fall. The fact is they did come to Polands aid exactly as promised and the concept of peace without a polish state was never accepted by either government until the collapse of France with the Vichy government and with certain members of Winston Churchills Cabinet. The was was fought as something that was expected to be drawn out, the industrial and military might of the new German Reich vs the Allied forces who would eventually force a return of the Polish state hopefully without much damage."
