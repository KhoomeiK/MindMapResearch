PublicFreakout,ffqi5lc,t1_ffq9c44,1580135264.0,Please find out! I need to know. This apparently happened 5 years ago. I wonder if they ever sued.
suspiciouslyspecific,ffjbrp3,t1_ffj371x,1579994977.0,In my day we had Chat Roulette for that.
addiction,ffiacb7,t1_ffi8fcd,1579969121.0,"Good idea! I tried to google it and it said the song is literally about Pompeii and a conversation he imagined between two people stuck in the same position over a period of time. 

I really dont know how the song isnt about addiction lol but I forgot to mention my favorite part of the song.

But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like
Nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like
You've been here before?

That part used to hit me so hard because it reminded me of how everytime I relapsed, I just wound up in the same exact place as before. 

I hope more people comment on this thread. I always loved music therapy and listening to music about addiction."
addiction,ffi3fgc,t3_etq7tn,1579963951.0,"I have a couple!

Lady Gaga- Dope 
This song literally made me cry. I know its about marijuana but we call heroin Dope around my area so I took it as heroin. 

Bastille-Pompeii
I dont even know if this song is about addiction, but I always took it as it is. 

For example: I was left to my own devices/ many days fell away with nothing to show for/ and the walls kept crumbling down in the city that we loved...

I took it as, just using all the time (being left to my own devices) for years and years and having nothing to show for those years (i got zero accomplished those years I was using besides dropping out of college and getting fired from jobs) and now the city that I grew up in felt like a prison.

Oh where to we begin?/ the rubble or our sins?

Do we fix ourselves or the mess that our addiction has caused us?

I could analyze that song for days. It has become one of my favorites."
addiction,ffi2vbq,t3_etqkh3,1579963477.0,"I had a really bad crack/cocaine/heroin addiction and I was able to drink again after a little bit. 

I never really liked drinking to begin with so Im sure that helped. Im also around people who dont drink in excess either. One wine at dinner or one drink to watch the game.

Also pay attention to your moods and triggers. If you know youre in a certain mood where you know you just wanna get fucked up and dont care what its on, then dont do it."
AskReddit,ffbwh11,t3_esi1iu,1579785047.0,"I worked at OfficeMax for several years. It was my first job. I got hired at 17 worked at a brand new store. That brand new store closed three years later. There were times when we didnt have customers come in for hours. I just thought it was normal.

I got transferred to another store. I stayed there for a few years and left and went to staples. Staples was a lot different. Stores were just busier. I returned to OfficeMax because they decided to pay me more. A year later, the Store manager left out of the blue. Then the assistant manager left a few weeks later.  Supervisors started leaving. Thats when I knew something was up. A month later they told us we were closing and that it was being merged with Office Depot and going online. There were no Office Depots around this time."
BeautyBoxes,ff31lt8,t3_er6mr9,1579531272.0,I just got the same exact variation! I cant wait to try the night mask.
Jeopardy,ferpppy,t1_fentc0q,1579356956.0,I just saw that he posted this on twitter and gave credit to where its due! What a great guy. Can we try and get him to do an AMA since we know he lurks on reddit now?
muacjdiscussion,ferkytt,t3_eq9l9i,1579355255.0,"So I legit used to be a crackhead... nobody would have ever been able to tell because I have very nice teeth and it actually contributed to my weightloss... but your analogy is actually spot on and I take no offense to it.

It's been almost a year since I've done it but being on crack, you get very jittery and you cant control your impulses. I did a research paper on cocaine use and found that people tend to use cocaine in binges. So when we buy makeup, when we know we shouldnt we are acting on impulses and buying in binges. Its literally the same addict behavior. 

My makeup addiction was actually the worst when I first got out off of drugs. I would display the worst addict behavior when it came to justifying my purchases (for ex: wellll.... I have ulta rewards points AND it's on sale because its the love your skin event so I might as well stock up on that Clinque Take Off the Day Cleansing Balm even though I still have half a tub left ) and impulse buying ( for ex: yes I need to get 4 anastasia Beverly hills singles because theyre on sale and even though I only need ONE color, ill buy 4 because then it's cheaper). 

But to answer your question, my excrackhead brain bought the clinque take off the day cleansing balm from ulta along with the mammode lip mask because they were featured on Ulta's love your skin event and because I had reward points."
Instagramreality,feg7drc,t1_feerjs4,1579080504.0,Thank you for this.  Im pregnant now with child number 2. I gained so much weight.  Its been really hurting my self esteem. Im not used to being this big.  I still have 2 months to go and I'm only getting bigger. I feel so unattractive. I keep telling myself its only temporary. It makes me feel better knowing Im not alone gaining so much weight during pregnancy.
muacjdiscussion,fd2ymms,t1_fd2tfkg,1578153003.0,"You're right. I guess i shouldnt have brought it up. I dont know what men go through. Im not a man. I just found it interesting that they do go through the same thing we go through. I have horrible social anxiety and I try and keep my comments to a minimum because I tend to say stupid things and this is one of those times. 

As a women I had to delete most of my social media because my self esteem is horrible. I gained so much weight from pregnancy and see pictures of Kylie like a month after she gave birth an wonder why I cant look like that."
Methadone,fcz9sda,t3_ejn5d5,1578096558.0,Yes I actually got my Medicinal Marijuana card to help me taper from methadone! It worked pretty well until I had to stop both my raper and the marijuana use because of pregnancy. But Opioid Use Disorder in Adjunct to Medication Management was just added as a qualifying condition in my state.
Drugs,fcxrmg7,t1_fcxpzwl,1578069501.0,This was removed too :(
aww,fcxghcl,t1_fcwivpe,1578062314.0,I am Incredibly stupid lol he loves her though even though so I have no doubt they'll be best friends growing up. I just wish he'd get along with my kitties. He always wants to play with them. They just box him until he goes away.
Awwducational,fcvxe6r,t1_fcv8n5n,1578012269.0,Thanks for this article. It was very informative.  I had about 15 to 20 vultures make their home in the woods behind my house. They literally came out of nowhere! And They are extremely social! They would literally sit on the roof tops of 3 or 4 houses. They were mostly turkey vultures. I know this because of the red head. But a few times I spotted a few that were all black. So they were definitely following one another.
aww,fcvg1e7,t1_fcvbjzz,1578001328.0,"Yes we got a german shepherd/husky mix he was about 12 weeks and just having to house train him and go through the teething... I could barely do it when my daughter was 3, i cant imagine what it would have been like when she was a newborn. I commened you!"
aww,fcvfm80,t1_fcvd6io,1578001076.0,"I gotcha!! My kitty was about 3 months not 3 weeks like OP but theyre still best friends.

aww,fcvfeex,t1_fcvehtb,1578000947.0,"Pretty much! This cat loves her. Wherever she is, he is. He's 3 months older than her though not 3 weeks. They take naps together, sleep together, play together. Definitely best friends."
aww,fcv4ate,t3_ej1u74,1577994356.0,I did this with my daughter. I would suggest definitely getting a kitten and NOT a puppy with a newborn. The kitty loves my daughter. Theyre both 3 and they follow eachother around
PanPorn,fcv3pnn,t3_eiov6l,1577994008.0,"So i save my mascara wands, clean them out, and donate them! Its for a good cause. If you still have this many empties... I think they accept wands every February and Novemeber! Its to help little animals they use it for like a brush to brush out larvae and ticks in wildlife. Its called wands for wildlife :)"
PanPorn,fctp0hv,t3_eir7y7,1577952239.0,I did this too with my bum bum cream!! I got a sample and loved it! So i have all 3 sizes.
OpiatesRecovery,fcsxjz1,t3_eipuj5,1577927633.0,"I went to 4 inpatient rehabs, 2 IOPs, 2 detoxes, got to my 4th step, and still relapsed not long after every time. Finding out I was pregnant was the start. I actually found out in the hospital. I was in the hospital with a nasty blood infection from an infected abscess. They made me go on Methadone because I couldnt withdrawal while being pregnant. It really saved my life. I was honestly just tired of the lifestyle. The baby's father didnt wanna be in her life, so i knew I'd be all she would have. Three years later, my daughter is my heart and soul. I also havent touched a needle or ang opiates in over three years. You reach a point when youre just over it. Life is so better without having to get high."
PanPorn,fcshi79,t3_eiinsq,1577916641.0,This is my favorite concealer!
