calmhands,ffxxutp,t3_evt34y,1580334554.0,nice job!  love the polish too.  painting the ring finger something different is always fun :)
patientgamers,ffxlk66,t1_ffxeia9,1580327595.0,"I didn't realize I wanted this until you said it.  Is it possible to have a big map with only a couple AI's?  Cause that would solve things a little.  Have a giant map but only one opponent and turn off Domination win so they don't mess with ya.

I started a Civ VI game this week but before we even got to Medieval period Cleopatra was hating on me for not having a strong military.  like.. I just want to go for a science win.. I don't have time to waste on building up a military when I gotta build builders & settlers."
AskWomenOver30,ffs3sv4,t1_ffroiif,1580172431.0,"Same!  especially on the rather play video games than watch a movie.  I always prefer video games as an entertainment source because at least it's interactive.  

What games do you guys play together?  Husband & I have played Diablo III, Destiny 2, and Divinity Original Sin 2 together.  We started Halo Reach as well and plan to play through those together as they release.  I'm particularly excited to play through them all since I've only played the campaign on 3 & 4.. I was mostly a multiplayer kinda gal during the heyday of Halo 2 & 3"
AskWomenOver30,ffs3ecv,t1_ffrteg8,1580172151.0,"same!  all my coworkers are women my age or older & think it's funny that I'm a gamer.  They'll be taking about a game their kid wants and I can jump in with ""oh yeah I've played that"" or ""oo I want that too"".  Always surprises people, especially when I say I like playing shooters like Halo or Destiny."

calmhands,ffgn2j8,t1_ffgmotx,1579910065.0,"I'm at work & was about to Google the polish but realized that might come across as NSFW lol  Tried it off work network & didn't realize it's a UK brand.  I'll have to find a comparable color on one I can find in the States.  

Thanks for letting me know and hopefully using a fidget helps :)"
calmhands,ffgcyfx,t3_etehof,1579903475.0,"Did you paint them yourself?  I love the color and I'm curious what it is

also good job!!  a fidget device helped me a lot with the mindless picking/biting"
BabyBumps,ffg71k3,t1_ffg6kh0,1579899841.0,I love it!  5th Element is my husband's favorite movie :)  congrats on your baby boy!
BabyBumps,ffg67e3,t1_fffjz3t,1579899321.0,"that's great!  Also, Corbin makes me think of 5th Element"
Anxiety,fffuca9,t3_et1xah,1579891974.0,"sounds very similar to me.  loud noises in general aren't bad but slamming doors & yelling get me feeling super anxious.  i grew up with my parents & brother constantly fighting.  my husband is the same way and grew up with a mom & stepdad who constantly fought.  

i was just talking about this with my husband lat night cause we moved into an apartment recently and our neighbors yell all the time.  the last couple nights the neighbor dad was full on yelling at his family with f-bombs and everything.   i could hear every word even with my headphones on and it almost made me go to bed early so i could ignore it.  they have young kids and sounds like he was yelling at them which just makes me so sad :("
CozyPlaces,ffftby0,t3_etaf9j,1579891351.0,I like that the bottles on the counter are arranged by height.  Also - snake plants are the best.
BabyBumps,fffk427,t3_et9peu,1579885684.0,"I had a midwife deliver my son too and she also took time to stretch things out by having me stop or only push lightly so she could do it. I think that's why I only had a couple 1st degree tears (and my son was 8lbs w/ a head in the 98th percentile!).

congrats and welcome to motherhood!"
CitiesSkylines,ffdrade,t1_ffc0ht1,1579827001.0,Hey me too!  550 hours and all my cities end up the same.  I am not a creative person and I tend to play to try to see how big of a city I can build but they never look very good.
GirlGamers,ffdplrr,t1_ffdou0o,1579825941.0,"haha yeah I try to avoid the ones that are just to make the women sexy.  The campfire one also adds new skills to level so that's kind of an extra bonus there.  Definitely try on another play-through when you need to spice things up.  

I had as many graphic/texture mods as my PC could handle so I totally get that.  It's a gorgeous game and I had a lot of fun with it.  shit.  now I wanna play again :D"
GirlGamers,ffdmvl0,t1_ffdarol,1579824265.0,that's exciting!  it's so much fun!  I get overwhelmed with open world games but Skyrim was just fantastic especially with mods like you said.  My favorite mods are Campfire & Frostfall to add survival aspect.  It's nice having the type of clothes you wear make a difference on your survivability.  like of course just wearing leather won't do much when you're at Winterfell... gotta get that fur!
GirlGamers,ffdmhs2,t3_esyami,1579824031.0,honestly one of my favorites I've seen on here.  this is how I imagine my setup when we can finally own instead of rent (and I can have my own office!).  gray & soft pink are such a great combo!
beyondthebump,ffct2mc,t1_ffc5oc1,1579806689.0,"Mine didn't have a nursery either but I definitely would have liked it.  I ended up peeing myself because I couldn't get anyone to come take baby so I could waddle over to the bathroom, and I was having a hard time getting out of the bed with baby to put him in his bassinet.  Kegel muscles weren't quite ready to hold it in yet and I felt like I was 5 again in kindergarten having an accident.

I plan on delivering #2 in a hospital that has one, if I can.  I know I'll need the rest before heading home to take care of two kids."
beyondthebump,ffciwzm,t1_ffc4tio,1579800437.0,"fuck that hit me hard.  there was one night with my almost 2 year old where he just did not want to go back to sleep.  he woke up at 1am crying & would not let me put him back down in his crib.  he was like clinging to me hardcore and would only want me to hold him while we sat in the rocker.  this went on for almost 3 hours and I had work that morning.  I was so incredibly frustrated that I started sobbing while holding him.  but that freaked him out so he started crying again and screaming at me to stop crying which only made me cry more.  eventually I calmed down so he calmed down and I don't remember what happened after that but I remember sleeping so I guess I got him to chill at some point.

and my husband slept through all of it because he had class the night before and was exhausted.  also my son was in a phase where he only wanted me and it effected my husband a lot when our son would say he didn't want him so husband wouldn't have been able to help."
entwives,ffcgmn9,t3_esu7oe,1579799034.0,What sort of genres do you like?
todayilearned,ffa80ig,t1_ffa6tni,1579729673.0,">What are you supposed to do, bring a jacket to wear only inside but not outside?

Yes, exactly.  I work in an office & have a space heater I use year round because it's uncomfortably cold inside the building.  Especially in the summer when it's 90F+ outside & they're blasting the AC."
Anxiety,ff4niib,t3_erk0nq,1579567918.0,"I'm currently doing that thing.  My workload is crazy at the moment and I keep finding myself too anxious to function or concentrate on what I'm doing, especially when I hit a roadblock on the work.  I wish I wasn't like this but I can't seem to stop.."
BabyBumps,ff4n5q7,t1_ff4jvjy,1579567667.0,I was just thinking the same thing lol
povertyfinance,ff3z31h,t1_ff3vd9r,1579551994.0,Only CA and NJ unfortunately
Mommit,ff3kkkz,t3_erfylb,1579543023.0,My husband & I have an app on our Andriod phones called Kids Place.  It locks down the entire phone except for the apps you allow.  Basically turns it into a kid's device.  If they somehow get out of it (hit the home button or something) the app will automatically open back up.
science,feyqvn2,t1_feyp9a1,1579449428.0,"I think regret is a somewhat common feeling during the first month or so of having a kid especially if postpartum depression is present.  I definitely had the thought even though we planned our pregnancy. 

Like you said, no one acknowledges it but I think they should. I spent the first month in a weird mental space thinking I was a terrible mother for regretting our decision. I was still taking care of him and loved him but realizing how different things were was a little overwhelming"
