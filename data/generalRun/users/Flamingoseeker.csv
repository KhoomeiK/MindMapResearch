lifehacks,ffq6l1n,t3_eum8za,1580123248.0,"This is a super simplified way of looking at it though. 

1. In a city, this would NEVER work. Purely because of the amount of people wanting food vs viable eating places

2. I can just imagine the lines to a place like this. They'll serve ssomethingreally good one night and there'll be a line around the block but itll be almost dead empty serving thing that arent as popular.

1. Unplug everything (power, HDMI, anything else thats plugged in)


2. Try to power it on (itll probably beep once or twice because of the left over currents) repeat dressing the power button until it doesnt beep anymore. 


3. Grab something like a cotton bud to clean the sockets and just wipe the console over to get rid of any dust or dirt.


4. Carefully plug all the cords back into the console leaving the power till last.


5. Plug it back into the wall and try turning it on.

So, I'm one of those people who think funerals are for the living, which right now, you are! I'm all for being able to have a say. IF you're lucky (? For lack of a better word) Enough to be able to be in on the plans, you ABSOLUTELY should. 

If anyone attending has a problem with any part of it at least your husband and/or family can have a laugh and just say ""this is exactly what she wanted"" instead of suffering through hours of things you didnt want to begin with.
