Sounds odd but... I feel that when youâ€™re an atheist, ideally you wouldnâ€™t be concerned with religion at all, including the lack of it. Instead youâ€™re focused on what makes you happy and a better person. 

This subreddit isnâ€™t for people who have reached that part of their journey. This is for awareness; consoling and comforting people who recently left theism; and those who are in the anger phase, to vent via memes and poking fun of Christians.
