relationship_advice,ffjbwq8,t3_etwuhn,1579995057.0,Breaking up is hard.  Regret is MUCH harder.  Reclaim your self worth and find someone more responsible with your time and attention.
relationships,ffjbn24,t3_eto7u8,1579994901.0,"Sorry for your loss.  Whoever enabled your sister to keep using needs help too, they are likely addicts themselves.  AlAnon helps.  Take care
of yourself and each other a little at a time."
relationships,ffjb76n,t3_etnohe,1579994637.0,"When I was mad at my family I was told “they’re just regular people trying their best”

When they were mad at me I was told “stop acting so selfishly”.  

If anyone else denied your feelings and blamed you for everything you’d negotiate with them or leave.  Because it’s family you’re supposed to take it? No thank you.  It’s difficult to let go of some toxic relationships but you don’t owe anyone your life."

todayilearned,ffj9vgs,t1_ffir0ob,1579993831.0,Take a good look around.  Nobody’s learned shit from history let alone remembers the title of a book.
relationship_advice,ffj9exp,t3_etrevx,1579993539.0,"Girls: OMG WHY do you keep turning your head when girls walk by WTF if you want those skanks just LEAVE I don’t need you ASSHOLE!!!

also Girls:  He’s just a friend damn why you acting like a mama’s boy all of a sudden do you need a titty to suck on??"
socialskills,ffisx5o,t3_etubbv,1579981908.0,Funny for me it’s opposite.  I don’t enjoy being pressured into being social
politics,ffip5o4,t3_etpxby,1579979246.0,I thought killing democracy was the point of electing a douchebag dictator?
dallasmavericks,ffi91l5,t3_etj57g,1579968209.0,Probably better to keep KP unless Drummond could be signed for significantly less allowing the team to sign another FA wing.  Another big deciding factor: does Drummond miss as many games as KP?
politics,ffi3j0p,t3_etp1ag,1579964036.0,I wish I could understand the “undecided” crowd lol
funny,ffguc8u,t3_etddv8,1579915272.0,Pretty doggone accurate
politics,ffgqk6w,t1_fffoefb,1579912527.0,Tribalism.  Don’t overthink it.  Trump followers certainly don’t.

nottheonion,ffes5xu,t1_ffendgw,1579862929.0,"I’d love to join you in some tribal warfare but this is bigger than party politics.  I care more about issues than who’s got the bigger dick.  I’d like to see us move towards reduced or free health care, education, ‘neutral’ internet, firearm registration, and further investment in our environment and energy programs.  And no more bail outs for corporations!"
pics,ffe7sfb,t1_ffe3u76,1579839013.0,"This I totally agree with 100%.  In order to discern who is who we need to refine our vocabulary or it is going to simultaneously de-value the term nazi, alienate those who are not nazis, and make it difficult to tell who the real nazis are."
relationships,ffe1vb9,t3_esyvpz,1579834527.0,This 30yo “man” is acting like an infatuated high schooler.  Maybe he just needs to grow up? If so let him go while you move forward with your life.  Bottom line is: he’s just not that into you but this is how we learn to set boundaries with harmful people.  That includes the flirty friend as well.
nottheonion,ffe1b76,t3_et2qog,1579834127.0,"Makes you wonder who’s paying attention.  Not Fox News obviously, but the rest of the world? What have other countries done to counter corruption and bankruptcy especially with larger business and banking entities?"
atheism,ffdy4cd,t3_eswoyy,1579831817.0,"Same here but with the following caveat: If they’re not judgmental it makes discussion much easier and I try to follow their lead, it’s something I need to do anyway."
OkCupid,ffdxcmb,t3_et1l1f,1579831266.0,Next time I’m giving my gf a little head I’ll give her something to read but nothing funny or she might fart in my face.

pics,ffdvpwq,t1_ffduhei,1579830107.0,THAT’S the problem.  If you make a mistake it doesn’t necessarily make you a criminal.  I’m not trying to sneak any fascism into this site when I say calling people nazis does more harm unless you can prove their commitment to those bad ideas.
pics,ffdufzz,t1_ffdu6i7,1579829204.0,You’re correct but so is the comment above it.  I think it means we need to find better vocabulary instead of those old labels.
politics,ffdgejq,t1_ffbfcyy,1579820320.0,Good point the bias lies in what we see AND don’t see.  What do you mean by “false hope in humanity”?
science,ffd4zz2,t1_ffd420j,1579813534.0,"Interesting thank you I’m going to look into this more.  Fyi the anti-gun narrative probably comes from folks who want what you want, less crime.  Even if their ideas seem like nonsense to you."
science,ffd4byx,t1_ffd360r,1579813162.0,Sounds reasonable but with this law in place why then does the US still have such gun violence? Is it a breakdown in the legal system or prison system?

aww,ffd2dy7,t3_esvjvs,1579812063.0,I was not ready to see this much floof
science,ffd24oc,t1_ffczr4v,1579811916.0,So if we can’t effectively control the flow of arms how else do we protect ourselves? Better mental healthcare? Beef up security everywhere? Place chips to help police track specific weapons?
science,ffd1qqg,t1_ffd0cu6,1579811700.0,"Maybe my question wasn’t clear.  I’m interested in best policy to prevent illegal trade, not gun violence statistics.  Sorry if I’m too dense to make any connection between the two."
science,ffd1d3j,t1_ffczqwh,1579811488.0,How do they accomplish this?
science,ffcx6k7,t3_eswz5j,1579809130.0,"Even if guns were completely illegal and no one owned any, how would a country protect itself from citizens who seek to own one anyway? How would we be better at preventing illegal arms than say illegal pharmaceuticals or even immigrants?"

politics,ffcdraf,t3_esu7gv,1579797268.0,"So if his cult members are correct when they cite “the economy is doing great” as one of the many things Trump has accomplished, what will be their position when things recede a bit? China? Democrats? Hillary’s emails?"
politics,ffcdgrg,t3_esteon,1579797084.0,"I think this is one fact that his supporters love: he is honest about lying.  Narcissists like Trump are not committed to the words they use, he has said two opposite ideas in the same sentence.  He OPENLY LIES unlike someone who tries to hide the fact that they’re lying."
politics,ffccvdk,t3_estdp9,1579796717.0,"That’s the problem with an uncorrupted legal system: it’s non-partisan.  Party-going freaks will hate or love it because it speaks the truth, which only some of the time fits their preferred narrative."
politics,ffcch8z,t1_ffc9469,1579796473.0,I prefer “Trump is a man of the absurd”
politics,ffc5i5g,t3_esrt54,1579792000.0,What could possibly be their argument for doing this?
todayilearned,ffbyiul,t3_eskqfi,1579786819.0,And lo another religious “law” was created by the hands of men and god who dost not exist showed no anger or wrath.
politics,ff8u9xf,t1_ff8kum8,1579696304.0,"Personally I understand Reddit’s bias, it’s generally obvious, and I can deal with it.  I don’t think I’m the only one who has learned to tell opinion pieces from factual ones, and to check any factual claim against several other sources.  Also, time tends to reveal truths!"
