If this were a 1975, I could almost see it, but even then the wiring was well coded and connectors designed for one orientation (it would have to be reversed at the steering column, and that connector is complex enough that reversing would have to be intentional).

For example: typical 1975 Ford column connector has about *16* wires in it. A more modern car will have many more (airbag, cruise, stereo, headlights, etc)."
