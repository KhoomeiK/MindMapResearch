As a security guard, I imagine that they are instructed to be extra vigilant about when someone touches you. If you allow people to make contact with you inappropriately, you risk performing the one job you are tasked with - maintaining security.

The security guard is not some average Joe. He has to maintain security, and to do his job, he needs to draw the line sooner than most people would. Most people would probably say, ""Hey OBJ, don't do that."" (the reasonable response that Wess wanted) and leave it at that. But as a security guard, if you let people off with a warning when they cross the line, you risk being overrun.

Head on over to r/personalfinance. It is a no-nonsense subreddit. They will not - WILL NOT - give you any get-rich-quick investment paths, but they will - THEY WILL - provide you with simple, easy-to-follow steps to maximize your savings (they also have book recommendations that you'll find interesting).

In short, here are the steps:

1. Budget - You cannot know how much you can save unless you know how much you're spending. Track your expenses and your income. Do your best to spend less than you make.
2. Build an emergency fund - I believe that the general rule is 6 months of expenses (see step 1). Once you have that, move on to step 3.
3. (you may be a bit young for this, but it still holds) Max out your employer matching funds such as a 401k, if available - A 401k is a pre-tax investment. This is good (for the moment) because it means you save money before the government can tax it. You WILL get taxed when you retire in 39 1/2 years, but that is a small price to pay. If you keep investing, it'll be worth it. Additionally, the match is free money from your employer.
4. Max out your retirement accounts - Start with a Roth IRA. This is a post-tax investment, but the good news here is that as it grows over time, you will NOT be taxed when you take the money out. There is a salary cap to this one, so take advantage of it for as long as you can. Once you get past that salary cap, max out a traditional IRA.
5. Invest in index funds (when you get into steps 3 and 4, make sure you select index funds as an option) - Index funds are stock market investments that have the most reliable returns of any investment out there. Yes, there are stocks that turn out better results, but you have to manage those investments actively.

That's it my friend. Complete steps 1-5 and you'll be just fine. It's great that you are interested in getting started now. 20 is way, WAY younger than most people start getting serious about saving."

I'll grant you one thing: he was 7 yards deep on that throwaway, not two. He takes the sack, they probably run a draw and then punt.

The timeout was critically important for the Seahawks. They took a timeout ahead of the two-minute warning after a run. Then they let the clock run to the two minute warning after a second run. Then they took the timeout after the Graham reception (again, risky; that it worked out makes it water under the bridge). Without that extra stoppage, it would have been: timeout, two-minute warning, probably a run which takes the clock to 1:20, then a punt inside the 20. 80+ yards in less than 80 seconds with no timeouts would be near impossible, even for Russell Wilson. 

But just try it next week: if the Packers are leading late in the game against the Niners, come on to the game thread and argue that they Packers should pass instead of losing a yard or two on a run. Please let me know when you do so I can watch.

I have never heard anyone advocate that throwing the ball away rather than forcing the other team to use a timeout be the right decision when you're trying to grind clock. The reason being that timeouts are incredibly valuable in the endgame as they allow the trailing offense to utilize the entire field rather than try to force throws to the sideline. 

All you have to do is look at team tactics when trying to gring the clock. Why is the offense running even when the defense knows they're running? They don't care about getting stuffed because it's about forcing the opponent to use their timeouts.

To put another way, try to argue the point that teams should pass when trying to grind the clock. During the next game thread, put that argument out there and see what kind of response you get. 

Rodgers was vindicated only because of two outstanding plays to convert third downs. If his throw to Adams falls incomplete, the Seahawks would have had two minutes, two timeouts, and the two minute warning. That extra timeout would haver been very handy near the goal line because then the Packers would still have to respect every part of the offensive play book instead of just sideline/end zone passes if the Hawks got to their red zone."

That’s what was so mystifying. A timeout in those circumstances is incredibly valuable, and Rodgers gave one to the Hawks for in exchange for a few yards.

Given the next play, it wouldn’t have mattered if he had taken the sack, but because of the incompletion, the Hawks had an extra timeout that required a SECOND miracle from Rodgers.

Rodgers throwing it away on that last possession was absolutely inexcusable. If the Hawks got the ball back, he gave them a timeout for nothing. Had the Packers lost, he should have been crucified, and deservedly so.

Adams going out of bounds was bad as well, but he was effectively pushed, so it was harder to blame him.
