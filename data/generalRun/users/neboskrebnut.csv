And in fact today most of us can't even remember a 7 digit number in their head. But everyone reads and some even complain that people are too stupid because they don't read enough. With agricultural and industrial revolution people complained that it will destroy our jobs, guilds, professions... way of life. Yet today you're an engineer and don't think that this is a bad thing. In fact without those things you would've probably work the fields now because until not too long ago 90% of population were farmers and very few people were lucky enough to do something else.

Prices are going up not just because private (and not so much) establishments want more money. But because economy must grow. as a result every year, everyone and everything must be a little bit faster, a little bit more efficient. every year inflation goes up just a little bit.

If you studied engineering 100 years ago you didn't have to learn much. Even calculus was still in development. Yet today students spend first year just to learn the tools that they can use to start digesting engineering. Things like advanced calculus, linear algebra and multidimensional calculus is a must. That last thing wasn't even a thing 100 years ago. At least not in today sense. Then in second year they cover all that they can learn in early 1900s. Not in the same amount of depth and detail. But that's because next year they have to learn just as much, all that we discovered last century and consider standard by now."
