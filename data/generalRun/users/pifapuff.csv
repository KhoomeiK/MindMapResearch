AskReddit,fev9msr,t3_eqies2,1579394797.0,"Just experienced one this morning. 
My sister and I were in our driveway cleaning off our car. It was  snowing heavily, and visibility was limited. As I was dusting off the roof, I turned my head and saw a guy clear as day a couple metres away, despite the snow. He was standing still, and just staring off into space. I returned to my task, then realised ""I know that guy!"" When I turned to say hi, he was gone.
I decided I was just imagining it, when my neighbour walks by with his dog. He says hi, tells us to drive safe, and carries on. I realized the guy I saw earlier was my neighbour. But it couldn't have been him, either, because it was for a split second and he was wearing entirely different clothes.
Unsure what happened."
