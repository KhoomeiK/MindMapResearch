space,ff47uvu,t1_ff471u1,1579557445.0,It makes a lot of sense if one party can put nuke 110 km away of target instead of few thousands kilometers away and other can not. And i think modern amount of space trash let effectively hide it until actual launch.
space,ff449zt,t1_ff403z1,1579555211.0,A think atm their major goal is to shot down satellites. I think so because recent AA missile s are capable of that. I think their next goal will be military outpost in the space and next I suppose they will place nukes up there and this will mean the end of the world . But really I don't know.

russia,fe472ud,t1_fe40pus,1578856391.0,"Ah, this. I've visited the [Livadia Palace](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livadia_Palace) last year and highly recommend it to everyone. It serves as museum now. First half is dedicated to Yalta conference you're talking about and second to the last Russian Emperor Nicolai II and his family. The palace itself is beautiful both inside and outside and the garden is impressive too.
As for Poland, I agree to you. I fail to see any reason Stalin asked for it. Country ruined by war, requires a lot of investment and, as it turned out, absolutely no profit for USSR. Maybe it would be better to ask for more airplanes or some gold to rebuild or own country."
