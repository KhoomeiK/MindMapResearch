Another consideration, if you need to save 20% down payment and you make enough that you could save enough to have 25% saved then you could invest the 5% difference. In this scenario I would probably invest the 5% first then save the 20% in hysa and etc. It's best to get into the market earlier than later. Now if you get to the end of your time horizon and the market is down and your 5% is low you would just wait for the market to recover before pulling out for the house. You would still have the 20% safe. Also if you get to your time horizon you can always decide to keep the 5% in the market if you wanted to."

personalfinance,ffifr50,t3_ets958,1579972805.0,"I think you are spreading yourself too thin. You can save for all of these goals but doing so all at the same time might not be realistic. 

The best way to prioritize is to look at what is urgent and important. I don't know how long the zero percent interest will last but I will say the credit cards are most likely the most urgent and important, you can keep the funds in the accounts that you already have in there and you can still pay 3% towards 401k if you get a match for it. If you don't get a match then you should contribute 0% then use that money and the money that you usually set aside for kids and emergency fund and pay off the credit cards asap. Once the credit cards are paid off then take that money and use it to boost the emergency to at least 3 months but since you have kids maybe increase to 6 months. 

Once you have the emergency fund you should focus on your retirement even though it might be a long time horizon than college for you kids you need to realize that if you focus on kids funds then and not on retirement then when you approach retirement you may not have enough money and you might have to keep working. Eventually you might not be able to work but if you still don't have enough money you will probably be relying on your adult kids to support you. I think it would be better to relieve your kids from the burden of taking care of you then paying for their school. 

Now what you need to do is figure out how much money you need to retire. You should figure out how much you spend every year and times that be 30. That is a basic way to figure out how much you will need to retire. Now you will need to look for a retirement calculators online and see what you (employer contribution counts) to save in order to reach your goal, by 62 and also by 70 because there is nothing wrong with retiring at 70. Once you figure out your number save that amount and if you have anything left then you can save for kids college! If not as you get pay raises you might find more money to save for them or maybe you can look as some monthly expenses to cut in order to save for them. Also once your house loan is paid off then you can use that money as well. Maybe that will not happen until after your kids go to college and take loans but you can help them pay the loans or for other ventures. 

If you find that you cannot save for kids school or you can only pay in part start talking to your kids about getting scholarships and maybe part time work if they can so they can save. I think if you are financially stable that is a better lesson then handing kids money. 

You say that the children's funds were split during the divorce will the other side of the split still be available to the kids?"

The EU panel found that after exposure to BPA the human body rapidly metabolises and eliminates the substance. This represents an important metabolic difference compared with rats. EFSA will continue to monitor closely scientific findings regarding BPA and any related health effects.

FDA estimates that BPA exposure from use in food contact materials in infants and adults is 2.42 µg/kg bw/day and 0.185 µg/kg bw/day, respectively. FDA has determined the appropriate no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for its assessment of BPA to be the NOAEL for systemic toxicity of 5 mg/kg bw/day (5000 µg/kg bw/day) derived from two multigenerational rodent studies. This NOAEL results in adequate margins of safety of approximately 2,000 and 27,000 for infants and adults, respectively. The data reviewed on highlighted endpoints, such as the prostate gland and developmental neural and behavioral toxicity, were insufficient to provide a basis to alter the NOAEL used to calculate the margins of safety. FDA has concluded that an adequate margin of safety exists for BPA at current levels of exposure from food contact uses.
