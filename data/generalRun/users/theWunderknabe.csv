europe,ff8qfrw,t1_ff8m4f9,1579691771.0,"Of course it wouldn't have been easy. But it would have only been a small magnitude compared to east germany. After all Oblast Kaliningrad is just a million people and \~15000 km² compared to 16 million and 108000 km² of former GDR.

I imagine it could have developed into a german-russian (and perhaps also polish?) kind of joint venture, perhaps with exclusive economic rights to get more germans back there and things like that. Certainly not impossible.

Again: aside from war situations you usually never get any opportunity to get territory (back). So, again: fucking take it. Even if rebuilding that part takes some decades. Even when it evoles not into something good you will always have the option then to decide what to do (perhaps splitting into polish/lithuanian?)."

space,fd6ueud,t1_fd6r1ti,1578195843.0,"Good point but I think human language, culture, technology and everything is a bit different as it is very well documented and heavily based on maximum simplification.Like computers are based upon electric signals on or off and combining that to binary numbers and logic. Languages are based upon a realtively short, fixed set of sounds that are then represented even by simple symbols and then repeated over and over everywhere. Extremly obvious and simple to learn and its very likely that advanced species use similar systems and are thus good at learning.

Through TV-signals etc. we even supply pictures with fitting narration which would make it even easier. And lets not forget that TV-signals are designed to be easily readable and redundant so it will be easy to ""tune in"".

Dolphin language is probably not standardized and a very limited resource as dolphins probably do not talk about a variety of subjects like we do and document all that in manifold ways, which makes it much harder to actually learn it.

I guess for that reason it always showed more success when humans taught animals human invented ways to communicate (like sign language with chimps etc.) because those ""languages"" are designed to be easy to learn.

NoStupidQuestions,fcx8g5w,t1_fcx5tha,1578055360.0,"The US would not dare to do so. It's a different thing in a western european nation and an ally, compared to some country no one cares about and that holds no power.

However, same as the dutch would not dare to arrest US military people.

Imagine the US flying drone strikes in France or Russia. That would not go down well and France and Russia would certainly not let that sit and do nothing."
space,fcwzi12,t1_fcwbtr6,1578044408.0,"Think of it this way: everything that is right now beyond our hubble sphere is invisible to us in its current and future states and will forever be because beyond that the universe expands faster than the speed of light. However, some of that stuff will still be visible to that civilization today and for quite some time, so they can record it (and also past states AND future states of those things up till they receive our request for data exchange.).

They can then send us this information that would have otherwise been unobtainable for us.

You can also extend this in some way to the edges of each civilization's observable universe. Their observable universe has always and will always include parts that were never and will never be part of ours. So when they record everything they can send it to us (and vice versa) and we could add it to our knowledge.

Actually they could even send us information about our own observable universe in past states that we could not witness, assuming they existed for long enough. So for instance if they were already hyper advanced 4.5 billion years ago and watched our neighborhood we could witness the formation of the earth or moon or things like that, except from their perspective."
space,fcvzmze,t1_fcvxrra,1578013745.0,"Well imagine modern engineers/scientists get handed the most sophisticated encryption techniques of lets say World War 1. How long would it take them to decypher any code of them? Minutes? And thats just a 100 year difference. Interstellar species are likely thousands if not millions of years ahead. 

They would solve modern human technology in an eye blink. Hard- and Software.

The reverse of course is not true. Even clever people of ancient times could not reverse engineer lets say a modern electronic device. They would lack the tools to the tools to the tools to even beginn that."

space,fcvrslx,t3_ej44iu,1578008647.0,"Exoplanets that we discover tend to be very close to their stars so they visibly influence gravity (wobbling of the star) or block/emmit light.

A planet 9 in our solar system would be so far away that it would reflect extremly little light or influence its mostly empty neighborhood by its gravity and would thus be hard to detect."
space,fcvrjwn,t3_ej0bw9,1578008489.0,"Doubtful that Aliens contacting us in an official manner would contact an individual nation or organisation.

If they do I would even find it more likely for them to contact a smaller nation first to seem as little provoking as possible. Perhaps Switzerland?

It would probably also not hard for them to hack into satelites and just use the internet or television to broadcast messages. Interstellar travel capability means they are likely way ahead in electronics as well and could easily do so.

A hostile species would not contact us at all and just obliterate us (with probably little effort)."
MapPorn,fcvqgei,t1_fcvplhr,1578007787.0,"Questionable, as probably even less than 1% of house OWNERS requested their house getting blurred.

So 99% of owners are in favor or neutral. And owners are only a small proportion of the population. A normal person with not much investment in a building is even more likely to be neutral or positive for streetview."
