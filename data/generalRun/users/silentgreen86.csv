WritingPrompts,fdy0zoe,t1_fdxy06g,1578774934.0,I'm not happy with the ending. But Im struggling to come up with o e that leaves the story where I want while also depicting his state of mind. So this will have to suffice for now.
WritingPrompts,fdxy06g,t3_enbhjb,1578774064.0,"""it's the quiet ones you gotta watch"".

That's what they always say, right? When some deranged bastard ups and kills his neighbor with a goddamn etch-a-sketch then hangs himself while ""It's a small world after all"" plays on loop from his boom box.
""He was always so quiet. I can't believe anyone would do this. He used to come over for dinner!"", says the invariably elderly neighbor on Live local news. I always figured this was media hype. Fear mongering to get neighbors to distrust each other, for the sake of a potential story.

"" I saw her levitate a cow onto her roof, then turned it to a puff of smoke!"".

Sure you did. Through your Coke bottle glasses and a pane of glass that still has dust on it from that dinosaur killer meteor. Couldn't possibly be another explanation!

But, fuck me. In the end those people were more right than wrong.

We always dismiss those accounts. The ones of the neighbor that 'Tried to warn you all!', but we never listened. Who would though? People make insane claims all the time, and most of us are far too busy to follow up on each one we happen to hear about, especially living in Florida. Florida man for president! So we ignore it and carry on with our day. I sure wish I listened. Hindsight's a bitch like that though,ain't it? 

The day dawned just as any other. Flaming ball of hate, trying to cook me as soon as I go outside, but I have plans today! Got me a date! Gotta clean on the outside chance she comes home with me. So I grabbed a trash bag, a ratty cloth I won't use again, and some windex, and go try to tackle my car mess. It's a shitty old Jetta but just MAYBE if I make the windshield extra shiny she won't notice the ceiling cloth is trying to hug us gently, like the empty reassurance of a lover who no longer loves you. 

Onthe drive there I slowly work myself into a mild panic. What if she finds me to be the most boring person ever? After all, I've only talked to her in passing at work before asking her out, and her shockingly agreeing. It took me weeks to work up the nerve to do it. I was so u prep for a positive answer that I just gave a nervous squeak that I hoped passed for a laugh, then turned and walked away. Had to go home and dri k a beer to get the guts to finalize details on Facebook. Aren't I just your hero? 

Details get kind of hazy after this. I think it's some sort of lasting shock. Whatever the cause, I do t remember all that good. More impressions of feelings, with the occasional clear image. Anyway, I got to her address to pick her up. I remember her house being fucking HUGE. Big enough to comfortably house at least 10 people, but I swear she said she lived alone. She was sitting on the middle step of the front porch. I recall a shape, or design, or symbol above the front door, but every time I try to record it in any way, whether drawing, writing, or simply telling a person, the memory sort of... *twists*. I don't know how to explain it. It is perfectly clear in my head. But slips into some unknowable form when I try to express it. 

I pick her up and we go about our agreed date plans. Get some food, go to the park, and see where we go from there. We ended up getting some street meat (read 'sidewalk hotdog vendor') because I was short on cash and she didn't seem to care all that much what we got. We ate as we walked to the park, the sun starting to fatten as it neared the horizon. We found a bench near the lake (more of a stagnant pond, to be honest) and tossed the bits of leftover buns while watching the birds fight for them. 

At this point a lot of shit happened almost all at once. 

I asked about a pendant on her sweater. The shape (design? Symbol? Fuck...) seemed familiar but I couldn't quite place it. It seemed like my mind refused to grasp it, as if formed from some unholy geometry that man wasn't meant to understand. She turned to look at me, and after a long moment of consideration, seemed about to answer. At this point the muggers attacked. I've never been so damn terrified. Had I been able to stand, much less run, I'm absolutely sure I would have fallen over screaming and pissing myself. These guys had huge knives (at least that's how my terror soaked mind remembers it), and looked damned ready to use them. One of the few things I remember clearly are their eyes. I wish I could forget them. Ever seen a meth head, screaming at at telephone pole because it (allegedly) insulted their favorite dish sponge? Probably not. But there is a queer desperation in their eyes. I got the distinct feeling that they weren't in control of themselves. And I don't mean that in the way of being a slave to addiction or some shit. I mean in the way I imagine a person would feel being a backseat passenger in their own mind. The abject, utterly foreign horror of being a spectator in your own body, watching your limbs react to commands you never gave. This is what made me want to crawl under the nearest rock and immediately die. Or at least go insane to stop from fully understanding what I was seeing. And these bastards were coming for us. 

Then suddenly, stopped. 

They seemed transfixed, staring at my date. To my shame, I had completely forgotten about her in my terror and sheer desire to get away at all costs. I turned to her and she seemed utterly bored by this. My mind struggled to make any sort of sense of this. My brain was desperately trying to will my body to life to get away as fast and far as possible, and her she sat, looking no more bothered than if a light breeze had blown a few hairs I to her face. 

These dudes then bolted. I mean fucking *fled*. I can't overstate this. I fear people will mean they turned and ran really fast. No. Nope. These guys moved away as fast as possible *at all costs*. I swear I heard bones break just from the speed at which they turned around to run. Flesh pulled tight on their faces like you see on someone skydiving. The sheer inhuman speed I don't believe I can accurately describe with the words available to me. However fast you are picturing, it was faster. 

My date let out a small snicker. Not one of amusement, but laden with contempt. God I'm glad I can't recall that part clearly. She then reached up and placed her hand o er the design (shape? Symbol? God damn it...) pendant, then with her other hand raised towards the muggers, gave a slight pinch and a small twist. And these guys *STRAIGHT UP DISAPPEARED*. 

Not ran out of sight, not fell down a hill, or behind a damn tree or something, just gave a small jerking in a direction I can't describe. Like turning 90 degrees from nowhere. Folding outside of yourself into non being. Hell I dont know. Just gone. 

She then stood up, smiled and thanked me for a lively date, and just walked away. As if the most insane shit to ever occur didn't just happen. I went home in a daze, and just fell on my bed into a sleep like a coma.

And here I am. I've woken up to realize I can't even remember what she looks like. I can't even give a name. I'm writing this hours later, mostly because I'm half convinced I'm going absolutely insane because every effort to accurately describe most details ends with me giving nonsense answers like you see above. I now see that nonsense symbol (shape? Design? STOP THIS!!!) on the edges of my vision almost all the time. I swear I'm being watched. And she is the reason. SHE! I have to confront her! I think I can feel where she is. The call is maddening. I ha e to do this. 

I think I have a knife here somewhere. Where's my boom box? I HEAR it! It sounds close."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdx9vpp,t1_fdlvggu,1578766757.0,"You are precisely correct. But the distinction between a service charge and a tip/gratuity is important and should not be conflated. Her are a couple examples of the laws.

Yes the articles are a few years old,but I wasn't able to find a more recent one in the time I had to look this up. I can find more examples if you'd like. And any you find that have seen these laws changed I would love to see. 

Service charge = must pay by law

Tip/gratuity = can be denied

The language is quite important in many states and can't be dismissed or ""considered the same"". I sure as hell don't agree with people refusing it, but I also believe it's important that people know their rights."
todayilearned,fdx4811,t1_fdwwm3e,1578765155.0,"I agree with you for sure! That's why I stated that my personal experience wasn't a great example, but it's what I have to work with in order to relate to the main point at all and express my views. My views aren't perfect and I think that I do pretty well adjusting them when shown compelling evidence otherwise. So by and large, I agree that traditional views and practices should have much more than a passing consideration. But should also be investigated heavily by as many people as possible. For instance, you say that parents are much more aware of the needs of the child. Do you have evidence of this outside of personal/anecdotal? I not trying to call you a liar or anything, and I'm entirely willing to believe that given evidence, but I've not heard of this happening either in my personal life, or anything online of this, and it seems to me that that claim is pretty general in scope and thus hard to measure by any metric that I'm aware of."
todayilearned,fdw0xhu,t1_fdvzklv,1578753896.0,I also agree with this! We shouldn't bli dly follow what we are told simply because it's tradition or told to us by a person in supposed authority.
todayilearned,fdw0kd0,t1_fdvxku9,1578753735.0,"I totally agree! Evaluating old ideas periodically is important for that reason also. What was once dangerous might not be now. Sorry, I didn't mean for my last post to take such a negative outlook."
todayilearned,fdvvg7c,t1_fdvsfp1,1578751959.0,"That has also been true in many cases! My personal approach when I run into this (mostly in my work environment of high end kitchens. I'm aware that it's not a perfect situational match to the main topic, but I believe that many of the entrenched methods of ""this is how you cook this because that's how it's always been done"" are rooted in the same mental practice of following tradition to the point of being dogmatic) is to consider with optimism (as like you said, there are many cases of it being spot on) but to also actively try to find fault in it. And I've heard people argue against this, saying that you will see fault even if it's not there because you are looking for it. But I believe that depends on the motivation behind the fault seeking. Personally, I'd much rather the other person be completely correct because I'd have to do less work. Just follow instructions and do it. But I personally can't do that for a couple reasons. One, I believe that kind of action leads to stagnation of innovation (again probably more specific to my field than some others). And two, my passion for what I do makes me skeptical that any one way or method is the ""best"" across the board.

I admittedly strayed from the core point there, but I've been awake far too long hah. Probably over thinking the whole thing."

Jacob had led a normal life. He wasn't perfect, he did his share of unkind things. But in general he led his life without malice. He wasn't vengeful. He forgave others. He tried to correct his wrongs. He helped where he saw he was able. 

His life was one of almost painful mediocrity, although he wouldn't recognize it as such. He had a fairly normal childhood. Dad like whisky a bit too much, but never got violent. Mom was distant, but always there when he really needed her. He went to school, made friends, experienced the sublime joys of love, and the acidic pain of heartbreak. And for the most part took it all in stride, experiencing the highs and lows without succumbing to the insidious qualities of either. 

He married, but had no children. Not for lack of trying, as his impotence only became apparent in the last few years before his wife could no longer bear children. But he got through it. He harbored no ill will towards fate, or a God, or anything outside himself. It just happened to be that way. His wife seemed bothered for a time, but he saw her get through it and that was that. 

On his deathbed he had no real regrets that bothered him. No gnawing dreads that steal into the mind in the small hours when thoughts are almost tangible. He had lived a full life. Tried not to hurt anyone as much as he could. His wife passed of natural causes a couple years back, bit he took it stoically. Death came for us all, the true uniting factor in all people. So he accepted his own passing with as much grace as he could muster, fading into death quietly, slipping smoothly into nothing.


From the nothing came an odd something. A dim awareness. Senses were there but not how they should be. He couldn't open his eyes, but wasn't sure if that was bad or not. It just was. There was a brief period of pressure, then suddenly senses! Agonizingly beautiful senses! Blinding light and jarring sound. A high pitched screaming that only briefly registered as his own. Everything was terrifying and wonderful, and felt right. 

But it wasnt. 

"" I shouldn't be aware of this"" he thought. 
""I shouldn't have the words to express that I'm aware of this!"", panic starting to creep and take over. He screamed from desperation, nobody paying attention because that's what babies do, right? He tried to fight but couldn't will his weak body to obey, and passed into sleep from exhaustion. 

He woke to his alarm clock going off, telling him to get his ass up and go to school. He was already late, but that 5 minutes of extra sleep after the snooze button was worth it. Fumbling off the covers and sliding out of bed, he shambled to take a shower and get ready, going through the morning routine on muscle memory for the most part. 

Grabbing his backpack and heading out the door, already hating the heat of the day he would have to walk in, he remembered he forgot his keys. He was already late for work and Derrick would be anxious to bitch him out, the sanctimonious prick. Like he's never been late before. He swung his suitcase off his shoulder, mildly confused as to why he was carrying it like that, went back for his keys and got into his car to head for work. 

Jacob walked into work expecting Hilda to rain hell upon him. We all thought Derrick was bad until Hilda replaced him a few years ago during the merger. But oddly enough he got to his desk with no problem. A bit of small talk with his nearby coworkers, but nobody acknowledged his late arrival. Something about this bothered him, but was so vague he dismissed it as guilt about being late. He got to work relieved he had flown under the radar. 

After a few hours he went to the bathroom, not only to use the facilities but also to escape for a moment. Fucking Dean with his country music. He got up to wash, feeling the creeping pain from his lower back where he fell off a ladder a couple years back. But he was retiring today! Lots of time to relax and take his ease. He had never had children, the doctor telling him that he was impotent, but that was a worry for ages ago. He had never really wanted one anyway. He straightened his tie and headed back to his desk. Someone seemed to be at it already. He was confused for a moment, then remembered he had moved to a different area a while ago. It seemed as if this was wrong, but he dismissed that, telling himself it was simply a senior moment. 3he finished the day and left to get ready for his retirement party, a small gathering of friends and family to commemorate his freedom from the workforce. 

Getting home he took a shower and sat on the edge of the bed, trying to will his back to cooperate and not riddle him with pain. Laying down he decided to just rest for a moment, ease his back and his eyes before getting dressed and going to his party. He told himself he had earned the right to be a little late, having put in more than his share of work at the company. He propped a pillow beneath his knees to help his hips feel a bit better and slowly drifted off, ignoring the rising sense of unease in the back of his mind, focusing on the soft mattress and firm pillows, just how he liked it. 

He woke up, still in the too hard hospital bed. He instinctively reached for his wife and found nothing , coming to the awareness again, just like every morning since her death, that she was gone and would not be back. Sighing, he rolled onto his side trying to get comfortable, but something was wrong. He couldn't say what, but something was terrible wrong. He felt sure everything was the same as when he went to sleep the night before, but also felt just as sure that this was horribly wrong. Sitting up to look around, he tried to be aware of his surroundings as possible. The same too hard bed. The obsolete tube TV hanging from the ceiling. The general smell, sickly and sweet at the same time. The chatter from the nurse station down the hallway. That one crack in the corner near the window that he had spent so much time looking at while waiting to die. It was all the same. But wrong. 

As the sun started to set, his unease grew. The feeling that this was all wrong became a surety that it was. Too weak to leave the bed, he clung to the rails like a frightened child, sweat starting to show on his brow. The feeling of wrong started to turn to one of deja vu. Hadn't I been through this before? The minutes ticked by, with every one he became more sure that he was right. Panic started to take full hold, his breath coming in strained gasps as his heart pounded against his ribs. He screamed in his mind for answers that would not be answered, of why this was happening, why him,what did he do to deserve this? Having used up what little energy he had, he slumped back into bed, full night having arrived. He couldn't fight the panic, his heart couldn't take the stress. He lay back and succumbed to his death, slipping smoothly into nothing. 

Awareness stole back into his mind, disrupting the nothing that was there. He couldn't open his eyes, but felt sure that was wrong, that he had just been able to see a minute ago. Then an oddly familiar pressure started to form. It felt like it was natural to go with it, but also nagged at his mind. 

Something deep inside screamed that this was all wrong, that this shouldn't be happening, but already that voice was getting quieter. The sense of wrong soon passed along with his other higher thoughts. He came I to a world of bright lights and painful sounds, the thoughts of wrongness almost entirely disappeared. He started to fall asleep after struggling and crying, then snapped awake, willing his too weak body to try to sit up and failing. This is wrong! He knew it was wrong. Trying desperately to get attention, to let others knoe that this is all wrong, but failing to make he unskilled muscles work how he wanted, he fell back exhausted. Something is wrong. 

""But at least I'm aware of it."" he thought before going to sleep. He had to get up early for school after all."
