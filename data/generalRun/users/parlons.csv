What you are saying about long-term retention and techniques to enhance it are the kinds of things I would be suggesting that poster take into consideration when changing their approach to study. But it's not a reasonable critique of the notion that their current methods are suboptimal, since this immediate ""dumping"" is characteristic of the least effective methods of study w.r.t. retention, not normative outcomes."
AskReddit,ffrk7xn,t1_ffrj0v4,1580159724.0,"I was saying that the way you learned in school wasn't effective because you said most of what you learned was dumped after the test, which is a different topic. 

If you're now saying that you didn't wish to remember those things because you don't perceive them to have value, sure, do the minimum amount to get the grade you find acceptable and move on. In your phrenology example, someone added that material to the curriculum for a reason, and of course I can't tell you what that reason was. But if your learning goals don't align with the curriculum, then sure, you may be wasting a lot of time. That sucks.

But when you critique someone for spending a lot of effort on schoolwork on the basis that what we study isn't retained, I think you're missing the mark. It's quite usual to study and learn and retain that learning. I also don't measure the value of what I learn by how likely I am to use it at work, but again that's a values question, not a case where one view is right and the other wrong."

My answer to that is, no. It's not ""the same boat."" In fact, there's not really a boat at all, there's just the universe. Our human way of wanting to process information flow causes us to conceptualize our experience in certain ways, in this case to identify a constantly changing evolution of atoms and forces as ""a boat."" But the only boat is the boat concept in the mind. So when you come back years later and look at this weathered boat with different parts and ask ""is this the same boat?"" the only sensible way to interpret the question is ""does my concept of identity over time and my concept of boats encompass this as being the same boat, or not?"" You can no more make an ""objective"" assessment about whether this is the same boat than you could measure whether someone is or is not ""the bad guy"" in a conflict.

So I don't take the Ship of Theseus to be an argument for an unchanging continuous self. In fact you may want to look at a closely related idea, also from antiquity, [Nagasena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasena)'s Chariot. During the course of [being questioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milinda_Panha) by King Milinda, Nagasena explains that when causes and conditions are a certain way, we say - here is a chariot - and otherwise we do not. But we see that there is not any chariot to be found in any of the parts, no chariot-essence or true chariot. [excerpt [here](http://www.jonathantan.org/handouts/buddhism/Buddhism-H04-Milinda.pdf)]. 

So if anything I would take the Ship of Theseus as an argument that there is no continuous, permanent, essential element of self."

But consider, a business can't enter into a labor agreement with an employee at less than the minimum wage, or decide not to hire people of a certain religion, or require workers to work unpaid overtime, or withhold wages because a manager is unhappy with the work, etc. All of these things are because businesses, going back to companies formed by royal charters in the 17th century, have been understood to be organizations formed within a larger civic society and to be required to serve a purpose within that society and follow its laws."

duolingo,ffhh69l,t1_ffhcx5t,1579935058.0,">  I don't really think this word in question is untranslatable. It is a philosophical concept coined by Ibsen. Such terminology would require elaboration regardless of the language. If you are a student in Norway learning about Ibsen for the first time, you still must be elaborated on the definition of this word.

If I may focus on just this, which seems to be the crux of your specific issue with this word, how is that different from any other word our Norwegian student will encounter for the first time, say for example the Norwegian words for mitosis, broiling, catapult? At first they encounter the unknown word or a concept they don't know the word for, then they learn it. It's the same for them or a non-native speaker.

I think that the ""untranslatableness"" of this word derives solely from the target language not having a closely analogous word, and has nothing to do with it being coined recently or having to do with philosophy. (If anything, I think the historical pattern is that philosophical traditions arise in distant places and end up inventing their own terms for concepts very, very similar to those invented elsewhere.)"

But even without examining reality at that level and instead taking the conventional sense of self representing a real thing, I think it's the case that sufficient quantitative change can amount to qualitative change. For example, you can't point to a single day where I was biologically ""a child"" the day before but had become ""an adult"".  Lots of different processes started at different times, proceeded at different rates, etc  and the total of all their effects could be described like that.

We agree that there are biological aspects of sexuality such as chromosomes. In the cases of typical development there will be corresponding sex organs and then in puberty certain specific developmental changes associated with each of the two overwhelmingly common chromosomal arrangements.

I'm not as sure that we agree on this next part, but I *think* we agree that there are a constellation of psychological (and worth noting, psycho-social) traits that are commonly ""gendered"" or associated with males or females, though there's a common understanding they can be present in any individual. And then there is this psychological trait of ""gender identity"" which is how someone sees themselves through the lens of gender. And we agree that people who engage in behaviors outside of the normative ones for their sex are not necessarily expressing that they have a differing gender identity.

You began by saying you object to conflating sex and gender, meaning seeing them as the same. But at the end, you say that a person's gender identity - how they see themselves - may not conform to reality, in the same way that they may see themselves as handsome (an oddly subjective choice) but be incorrect. If their sex is the biological reality and their gender identity is how they see themselves, how can their gender identity be incorrect (not conform to reality)? How they see themselves, how they experience their relation to the world through the lens of gender, is an internal qualia, right?

As to this question of castrated bulls, it's true that a castrated bull is not a cow. By posing the question in terms of farm animals, you put it in a context where psychosocial questions aren't being asked. You don't call a bull ""sir"" or expect it to wear a tie for dinner. So really we can't expect to learn how to treat our fellow humans by asking how we would treat a farm animal in an analogous situation. We can't explore gender in a space where it doesn't exist or at least isn't accessible to us, cattle lacking the power of speech. 

If I have a co-worker for example who has a strong view that the left hand is unclean and doesn't care to be touched by left hands, I'll take some care not to do that. I know that physically my left hand isn't unclean, and this is purely an idea in their mind. But it's an idea that affects their well-being and it's little trouble for me.  In this same way even for people who don't think that there is a [neurophysiological component](https://www.the-scientist.com/features/are-the-brains-of-transgender-people-different-from-those-of-cisgender-people-30027) to gender, it seems like a simple matter of humanity and civility to simply let people enjoy the social conventions that make them happy instead of insisting on some kind of chromosomal essentialism that means we can't say ma'am to someone because they are heterogametic.

I guess my question to you then is why you think it's most important that we use the words girl/boy/man/woman to describe sex, not gender, when gender is the place where we're interacting 99% of the time, and also why it's important to bring up and emphasize this essentialist view even when the topic is clearly about gender, as it was in the discussion above."

The Dhamma which we are looking for exists right here, but we don’t see it. Rather, we
persist in our efforts to stop wanting. We want things to be a certain way and not any
other way. Or, we want them not to be a certain way, but to be another way. Really these

That's totally irrelevant, since no one is claiming she discovered the double helix. As far as I know there is no controversy, no doubt that Watson and Crick made this discovery.

The question is a simple one - how did they make it, on what data was Watson and Crick's model based? Without data, the possibilities were nearly limitless. They relied on the work of expert x-ray crystallographers like Franklin and others.  Although even Crick and Watson disagree about who did what when, Crick goes so far as to say that the Franklin data was what first led him to consider the double helix. 

I understand that you want this to be some political thing, but it's just not. Watson and Crick first discovered the double helix model. They did so based on the expert x-ray crystallography of a small group of people. Sadly, Watson's egomania made it difficult for him to credit anyone else - even Crick was shunted aside in Watson's book.
Also, I knew about Rosalind Franklin in the 1980's and I've also heard Watson speak, that would have been the late 80s-early 90s, well before this book you have in mind. Although it's not my discipline, I was close to a number of people doing graduate work in Biology at that time, and both Franklin's work and Watson's ego were universally known."
