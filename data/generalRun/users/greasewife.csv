What is the basic setup of your nursery like? Most here start from quite young, there is usually a room for each age group and multiple staff members in each room with one supervisor/room leader for each. There's a big focus on child-led and play based learning, although some private settings have been slow catching up and still do a lot of adult-led or more typical school type academic learning activities.

ECEProfessionals,fejwdie,t1_fejrgcd,1579187374.0,"Thats what I'm finding here as well. Things are either hidden as soon as someone shows up, or the inspector just doesn't care. I'm glad there are people who keep reporting though, I'll have to keep encouraging staff to call up."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fejmotd,t1_feisdg0,1579180056.0,"I would immedietely wander off, find a sales assistant and tell them I was lost so I could wait at the big checkouts with a lollipop. Mum was cool with it."
MensLib,fejgtun,t1_fej8pmb,1579173594.0,"As a woman who also struggled with this with my husband occassionally, I think its because as women, the value society puts on you is how sexually desirable you are. It is really, really difficult to separate yourself from that idea."
ECEProfessionals,fejferi,t1_fejeyys,1579171566.0,"This is the same experience I've had, over double ratio by myself and I'm not even qualified. However surely if reporting was more common, it wouldnt be able to just be ignored forever?"

AskReddit,fejdnwf,t1_feixfqm,1579168925.0,Is cake mix a big thing in America? I've never known anyone use it in the UK.
ECEProfessionals,fejd4qf,t1_fejc4fo,1579168113.0,"Whenever Ive worked in settings that do this on purpose I report them. However Ive met other previous employees who were well aware of the same behaviour when they worked there and have not reported. There are also questions about similar or worse situations on here all the time. 


What I'm asking is why people don't report, and at least here, if you make a complaint the details of that will be given to the manager, so even if your name is witheld its pretty obvious who it was."

ECEProfessionals,fejbc26,t1_fejafyf,1579165394.0,"Yes. We have required ratios for amount of staff per certain age groups of children. Again, might vary in the US."
ECEProfessionals,feja24m,t1_feiqgm8,1579163557.0,"I agree with this. 
Children are independent individuals and have a right to be respected, especially in an environment that is meant to be theirs. 

If they do not feel welcome and accepted, of course they are not going to be comfortable and willing to cooperate with the enforcers of that environment."
