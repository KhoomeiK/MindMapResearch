Their customer service is a little slow but they want you to have the perfect ring and be happy with it."

I just don’t play games I don’t like, and I also don’t go online to rant about how bad they are. To each their own."

Video in km/h, euro plates. Car is right hand drive in a right hand traffic country, so it’s imported. I’d guess Germany or Russia. I don’t know euro plates and import laws well enough to say where. The front fender markers also give away that it’s not North American. 

Yes, the STi was available with this wing as an option. 

The scoop looks aftermarket (WRX had a smaller scoop than STi) and I can’t see the brake callipers so there’s not really a definitive way to nail which exact model this is."

IdiotsInCars,ffa7qmt,t1_ff9677i,1579729519.0,"This wing was an option on this year STi as well in Japan, but it’s not left hand traffic so likely US or Canada, and therefore likely a WRX. No STi badging on the back either.

Edit:
Not North American Plates. And no visible badging on the rear. STi lights, aftermarket scoop. Hard to tell for sure. Right hand traffic, europe probably - maybe Germany."
