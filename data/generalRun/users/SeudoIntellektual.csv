But anyway, pls try not to worry about this - this rating stuff I keep hearing about breaks my heart. Beauty is completely subjective - and I know this sounds like bullshit but what's inside really does matter the most."
depression,ffilldg,t3_etqbpl,1579976797.0,"This might not be a popular opinion but I wouldn't necessarily put all of them in the same box. The one friend who didn't deny it was probably afraid to speak up - possibly he/she was surprised by this kind of talk and didn't know how to react. I also don't know what age you guys are. People change and hopefully mature. I think you should talk to that one particular friend about this - offer them a chance to apologize
 
Ditch the other losers - they're not your friends and you don't need them."

AmItheAsshole,fe24qnb,t3_engdkr,1578834435.0,ESH imo. You could have maybe went with a less drastic approach (kicking her out of the picture entirely). But she definitely is a pain in the ass. She's still your friend though and maybe you can explain to her that she's being too picky. It is your day after all.
SSRIs,fde10oj,t3_eku09u,1578328747.0,"I made the mistake of stoping twice on my own. Once because it sent me into dpdr and I couldn't take it anymore so I stopped taking zoloft. Soon after I fell into the worst depression. I went to the dr completely desperate. She gave me brintellix and they really saved me. Since I was feeling better I decided to stop them...i can do it on my own, right? Wrong. I'm back on them and feel better. If your meds aren't doing it for you, consult with your dr. Maybe some other medication would suit you better. Good luck :)"
SuicideWatch,fddpjls,t3_ekr9h1,1578320484.0,"If I involved the police or CPS I would only be afraid that she couldn't take it emotionally and that she could actually  crack under such a stressful situation, on top of everything else. I would possibly talk to her parents and warn them what I would do if her home life doesn't improve (involve authorities). It would be even better if you had your parents support in the matter. Best of luck, I hope everything will turn out alright."
AmItheAsshole,fddocaa,t3_ekodtv,1578319444.0,"Don't know what's up with all the hate you're getting over the whole ""deathly allergic"" situation. Fine, you wouldn't jave died and you could have maybe accented that, but that still doesn't make you the asshole in this situation. I really hate it when people sit in my seat anywhere, so NTA"
depression,fcvnwok,t3_ej273i,1578006167.0,"Similar situation for me too. I say, forget them. Then again, I've been hurt so many times in life already, another asshole doesn't make much of a difference. I still trust people and always will. The possibility of getting hurt is extremely high with close friends but I don't obsess over it much anymore. I just see it for what it is, am thankful for what we had and move on. Took me years to get there though. I am kind of a loner, however :) Possibly has something to do with the whole relationships/trust issues from the past. :) Hope you feel better soon. 

And, I just want to tell you that she doesn't seem like a nice person and she probably did you a favor by showing her true colors. She has problems, sure, and I'm all for helping people and giving them second chances, but you can't be the one fixing her all the time. And you have problems of your own. Think of yourself first, you are more important. She had a great friend and maybe it's time she lost that friend now. Maybe she'll come to her senses."
depression,fcvlo97,t1_fcvlflw,1578004770.0,Thanks for the kind words friend. Hope all will be good soon for both of us.
AmItheAsshole,fab3zhl,t1_faacfoj,1575917425.0,Nothing about this was handled perfectly. If OP hadn't set it up everything would be even worse.
