todayilearned,fghtqp3,t1_fghsdz9,1580793608.0,"Theoretically I suppose, but the short answer is No.


Only two diseases have been eradicated, Smallpox and rinderpest, a disease mainly effecting cows.


To Eradicate a disease, there are a couple main requirements:


1. An effective vaccine or treatment, that is simple to apply. Unfortunately, the flu (a term which refers to a whole group of virus) changes too quickly for total vaccination


2. No animal reservoir. Humans can contract influenza from many different animals, meaning even if you eliminated it in the human population, it could be reintroduced by pigs, birds, bats, or other animals.


Measles, for example, is a target for eradication:


It can only be contracted by humans, and there is a cheap and effective vaccine."
