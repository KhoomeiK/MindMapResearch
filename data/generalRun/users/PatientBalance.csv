BreakUps,fezyeme,t3_eqzwtk,1579463241.0,"The situation got way out of hand due to lack of communication unfortunately. When you sensed that he was pulling away a little bit I think you should’ve talk to him about it. And if there was a reason that he was pulling away, he should’ve talk to you about it. It’s possible that the intimacy of sex and the emotions tied to that surprised him and maybe brought back some feelings of his ex that he didn’t realize were still there.

I think the worst part is that instead of talking to him that you were feeling uneasy about the distance you blocked him and I can totally understand why he would be really upset about that. If I was dating someone and things had been a little weird and the result was they blocked me on social media I would’ve taken that as a very immature move. I think you need to just be vulnerable and let him know how you’re feeling and be open to hearing whatever he has to say, whether that’s that he still has feelings for his ex or isn’t ready for a relationship or wants to slow things down or things just got weird over the holidays.
