I would not, for so many reasons, despite his overwhelming friendliness and tolerance for aggressive dogs. But just last week I picked up a little dog in an alley whose owners let him wander off leash. When they found me, I gave him back and they just dropped him on the sidewalk out front of their house again without a leash. No lesson learned.

There’s also an unofficial offleash dog park I take my boy to. My city is corrupt af and getting anything official done will never happen without spending stupid amounts on fees and even larger amounts on bribes. So we have an unofficial one, which is a small field at the far corner of dozen acre park, secluded from traffic. I would obviously prefer a fenced one, but we live with what we have."
