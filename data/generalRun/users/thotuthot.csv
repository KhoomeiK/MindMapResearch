We had the Chinese Exclusion act to kick out immigrants, the Brasero program to lure them back in, then project wetback to kick everybody out again, then the refugee resettlement and amnesty programs during the Reagan years, and finally Trumps travel ban and border policies today. Im sure by the time the 2030s roll around we'll be singing a different tune again."

bayarea,fdg0six,t1_fdfmxwd,1578375888.0,It didnt work for him. The CA supreme court threw it out.
bayarea,fdfi7s3,t3_el2yho,1578362297.0,This guy is using this property as a tool to challenge public access and the coastal act itself in the courts to have it struck down. His lawyers tried to state that the property was intact since Colonial times that the Coastal Act didnt apply to this portion of the state since it predated the founding of California. A rich asshole of the highest caliber.

If you are getting outcompeted by someone who is uneducated and doesnt speak the language, then the founding fathers and the idea of whiteness failed you. Your ancestors failed you. Whiteness isnt real, hermano. If it was, you wouldnt be so mad."
