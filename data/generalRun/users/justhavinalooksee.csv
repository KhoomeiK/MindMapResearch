Kids are just so insensitive though, and most of the time, are just following the crowd and have no idea the harm they do to others.

It is heartbreaking, and even more so when you are like me and we have never had a homeless problem in my area.

I told my kids from a very young age that if they were ever making fun of anyone less fortunate, or bullying I would beat their little asses, and I meant it, but they both turned into very caring young adults, and our house has always been full of friends of theirs that didn't have a good home, so I think lesson learned on that point.
I once saw a show on tv, maybe Oprah??, where former highschool bullies were brought on and confronted by kids they had bullied, and whether it was great acting or just true, most of the bullies didn't even remember the person confronting them. That to me, made it even sadder that some kids commit suicide over crap that in 5 years nobody else even thinks about. Probably even less time than that, but when you are the one being bullied and feel like life is over and not worth living at such a young age, true damage has been done. I hope kids will learn and bullying will eventually be truly unacceptable."

I tried to make it a game for kids when I realized the parent wouldn't/couldn't control them. Kind of like the quiet game, but give them a kids meal toy or dessert for praise if they were good and still long enough to order and eat.

So glad there are still good people out there that are willing to get involved instead of turning their head acting as if nothing happened."
