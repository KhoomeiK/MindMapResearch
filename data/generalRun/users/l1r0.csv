antiMLM,fgs4xgh,t3_f04xcv,1581071788.0,Can't get past how not on the line the majority of this printing is.
childfree,fgphzoh,t1_fgmb4kf,1581005174.0,Dealing with this type of personality is atrocious in the workplace.
introvert,fgp4vgs,t1_fgmu0v1,1580996901.0,"This happens to me as well. I am personally an analytical person who enjoys dissecting the topic of discuss wither it be a movie or current events. I find most people enjoy just scraping the surface, and not looking at the bigger picture. I get tired of trying to convince others the world is not just about them."
childfree,fgivnlr,t3_eyifey,1580831900.0,"I'd say the Super Bowl is predominantly men, and thy marketed the show quite well. 

Not shocking since many parents treat their child as king/queen snowflake of the world."
antiMLM,fgfeywy,t3_exzf28,1580736763.0,How bad does your credit score have to be to only be approved for a $100 limit? I hope she called and got it taken down by choice.
Youniqueamua,fgd1h80,t3_exc3sb,1580678125.0,I actually really like the scrunchies

childfree,fg4hn0a,t1_fg2xn40,1580503466.0,I'd rather be alone on my pedestal with my cat than be with someone of a lower standard. It's also interesting how there's so much marketing to get women to go back to the way they were before post-pregnancy.
childfree,fg4hdox,t3_ewkt9e,1580503342.0,Seems that whatever the woman has done in the past becomes irrelevant when they become a mother.  Such a sad life.
childfree,fg4h2k5,t3_ewo5uj,1580503194.0,I haven't considered the stress people put on creating a family. Thanks for pointing this out! Happy to say I've literally never thought about this lol.
childfree,fg3cufa,t3_ewk74a,1580478145.0,Well they won't be with you lol. Good luck!
childfree,fg3crkq,t3_ewmopc,1580478081.0,"Sounds like you two were honest with each other, which is great! Would you be open to being friends? Could be another option if you two had things in common."
childfree,fg0ojbr,t3_ewa0gy,1580411951.0,"Why'd you decide on a Tesla? 

Excited for a trip at the end of March!"
childfree,fg0o25a,t3_ew5btb,1580411683.0,"It is called ""Circle of Life"" if you want to avoid it for the rest of your life. I am an adult that loves Disney. I usually wait for later shows so it's the least likely to have kids."
childfree,fg0nhed,t3_ew7srf,1580411353.0,"Gaming is one of my favorite things to do at peace, alone, without any distraction."
childfree,fg0kusq,t3_ew72rj,1580409834.0,"No chance of a small terror wrecking valuable items in your home.

No endless episodes of kids shows (watch what ever you want)

I could go on!!"
bjj,fg07tp7,t1_fg04wur,1580402083.0,lol - that's great! One of the guys calls me a Portia spider. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDtlvZGmHYk) is the video he was referencing.
bjj,fg07cna,t1_fg055s1,1580401798.0,"I am not religious myself. What type of religion would this be? Would you know what their views are on having a romantic female partner?

It wouldn't bother me. I feel it's important to respect people's wishing provided they are not harming you in any way. One can refuse a roll anytime."
bjj,fg06jvm,t1_fg051jn,1580401311.0,Makes sense - thanks for clarifying!
offmychest,fg052a6,t1_fg046fm,1580400382.0,"This was the biggest eye opener. I didn't realized how great life could be. I cannot believe how long I have been selling myself short. I am actually using medical marijuana right now.

I started being depressed at about 11, and am just taking meds now at 26. I wish I had done it sooner so that I wouldn't piss away adolescence / teen years."
childfree,fg04qpu,t1_ffx6608,1580400177.0,Sorry that happened. I can appreciate how difficult that would have been for you. Wishing you the best of luck.
bjj,fg03ywg,t1_fg01y87,1580399698.0,I can see what you are saying - thank you.
bjj,fg03rbk,t1_fg01kuh,1580399567.0,"Right - I understand what you are saying. I can expand on my original comment- I feel there are different ways one can train with each other to make it more competitive and/or worthwhile for both parties. Would I want them going full strength? No.

 However, I typically have more speed  and can fit into smaller spaces than the guys and I train with. So, I would be able to help them with their guard retention for example."
bjj,ffzyfo1,t3_ew4lrz,1580396070.0,"Curious if you of the results of any of these complaints? That is appalling - I am a woman and would most likely quit if any combination of these things was happening.

I would say the asking out part is not terrible if both people are mature adults. Jiu jitzu is also a social activity where you meet people."

childfree,ffzxy7i,t1_ffzec6a,1580395735.0,I'm always nervous I'm going to drop them. I look so awkward holding them. They're cute for maybe 30 seconds tops. After that I want to go away.
offmychest,ffzxtj2,t3_ew4xc6,1580395642.0,"It's so great!! I have been taking meds for the last week (for the first time), and find it really helping. I went about 15 years not caring about anything. It has been great to have hobbies again. I wish you the best!"
childfree,ffztu3p,t1_ffyyqmy,1580392706.0,Wanting or not waiting kids =/= marriage. Not a difficult concept. There are plenty of kids that don't know who their dad is...
childfree,ffwia8k,t3_evjsrg,1580301941.0,What was the turning point of deciding to have them?
childfree,ffwhgab,t3_evhjd8,1580301140.0,How selfish can one be? How in the world can one consider a child-free person be more selfish than this? Appalling.

antiMLM,ffutv7a,t3_ev8h5g,1580249239.0,Pretty sure she's not making anywhere near this with the MLM. Cant see the point here.
offmychest,ffu1xk6,t3_ev5g4d,1580232733.0,Have you considered confronting or speaking with him about it? That is if you are still interested outside of these recent actions.
childfree,ffqhrru,t3_euhbqq,1580134957.0,It's like a parasite sucking the life out of you. Frigging gross.

introvert,femtnu4,t3_epl2i3,1579269285.0,Just ask her how she feels about you two having sex and go from there.
introvert,femsoff,t3_eppsop,1579268492.0,"I have honestly gotten fired from a job because I did not pick-up on ""social cues"" like everyone else. If it is that much of a concern I'd recommend getting another job. All workplaces have different people, different environments. Sounds like this one isn't for you.

There are many workplaces that would be happy to have your dedication and focus to work. I'd say it's a strong point you don't get distracted by useless conversation."
introvert,fems0hl,t1_felibq5,1579267942.0,"Agreed - I only spend time with people that are better than my solitude. If not, I don't bother spending time with them."
introvert,fe91n5k,t3_en2wxt,1578933242.0,"I also feel we are better at making deeper connections with people since we take the time to listen to them, and put thought into the conversion. Quality, not quantity."
introvert,fe9190q,t3_enafxv,1578933110.0,Communication is key in any relationship. Why not just ask him what's he comfortable with?
introvert,fe90yqr,t3_enaebf,1578933001.0,I am always friendly unless they give me a reason not to.  I do not understand the need to judge someone f you know nothing about them. There are many more fulfilling things to do. I try really hard to not bring my past negative experiences into a new experience with someone else. The new person did nothing wrong.
childfree,fdyfb4o,t1_fdy1t88,1578779124.0,Echoing this - I live in a city of about 95k. I am 26f. Many people I went to high school with have multiple children.
childfree,fdrswxt,t3_emrk1b,1578689241.0,"I enjoy helping others. I have a cat, and volunteer with those with special needs. I personally feel it is important for them to have someone on their side that is of (for lack of better word) regular- minded, and has their best interest in mind."
introvert,fdqn560,t3_emfri5,1578670599.0,Have you applied for other positions? Are the opportunities to move around the company where there would be less social interaction? Can you change your start time at all? If you worked different hours you might not have to deal with the hi/bye thing.
Anxiety,fdodj1t,t1_fdoczbn,1578603159.0,That's great. I am just in a tired dump today - sounds like the blanket will help.
Anxiety,fdocknr,t1_fdobav3,1578602706.0,Makes sense - thank you.
Anxiety,fdo8uyp,t1_fdo2s6k,1578600896.0,Is that the same as a weighted blanket? When exactly do you use it and how? I just have it on my bed right now as a regular blanket.

Learn from the mistakes and keep training. The more excuse you make, the less you will learn. That is life in the sport - sometimes you're the hammer, sometimes the nail."
