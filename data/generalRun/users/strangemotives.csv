But it was a major cooling event, not a warming event (although, I've seen theories that actually turn our situation into a cooling event, via stopping ocean currents by way of melting ice caps removing the ocean salinity) but that, at the time, was worse IMHO..  if it's cooler, the populations in colder climates are doing fine..

I think we're able, through our technological advancement to get through the tough times.. even if 0.1% of the population survives, it's plenty to pass a ""great filter"" and re-establish ourselves. The world may even go through a ""mad max"" phase, but we'll get through it as a species. 

I don't mean that I don't take climate change seriously, it's definetly a problem, but I'm just trying to be realistic by saying that we should have been tackling it in the 1960's, not just now.. it's too late to stop it now, we're past the tipping point.. let's focus on surviving it. Our efforts now are akin to a death row prisoner that files appeals for 30 years, just putting it off.. not that we shouldn't, if only to allow technology to develop a means for survival.. but it's going to hapen"

We're going to have to pack up and move everyone inland, while using further advances to protect from fires, storms, and to feed ourselves, while manipulating our environment, but I'm certain we'll pull through...

The frequencies we call ""radio"" can't really have a lot of bandwidth for an advanced civilization..  Even we are already putting less out than we once did, since everything has gone digital, we're just using microwave to reach our own satelites.

The odds of their being sentient life even nearby is pretty good IMHO, but for us to be perfectly lined up, not 2 billion years apart, it's pretty slim."
