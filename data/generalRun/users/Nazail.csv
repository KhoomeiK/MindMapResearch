dating_advice,fgnmlhi,t3_ezbfyh,1580948138.0,"Know that it does not necessarily mean that the relationship is doomed if it turned out a bit awkward or weird. Stuff like this can take time to get used to and if you both are willing to keep going then try. It took about 2-3 dates before we started talking smoothly and a lot more conversational. In about a month we were a lot more comfortable and cuddly. Teased each other, had deep conversations etc. Took 2 months to kiss but that’s cuz we were both cowards. 

Basically, it’s okay to take it slow, and keep trying if you both really like each other and the beginning was a bit bumpy/awkward."
