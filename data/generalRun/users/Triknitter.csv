If we had wanted our child circumcised, we would have had to sign an extra waiver at 20 weeks, an informed consent in the hospital, and pay out of pocket before the procedure. Nobody asked about circumcision at the hospital."

Aren’t you glad all those things are okay, because we judge humans by animal standards?"
AmItheAsshole,fczt7z3,t1_fcznjf6,1578108206.0,That’s awfully sexist. Why is a mom ditching her kids worse than a dad doing the same thing?

Both conditions exist on a spectrum, so if the choice is mild EDS or severe asthma, I’d pick mild EDS every time."

There’s a handful of stick margarines that don’t (Country Crock has a plant based margarine, as does Earth Balance.
