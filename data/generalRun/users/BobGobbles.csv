nfl,ffks4x5,t1_ffkoj60,1580027915.0,"It isn't about being perfect. But when you have a garbage o-line, no run game to speak of and a defense that can't help but get the opponent off the field by scoring, you can't put that on the QB. Our o-line was *garbage* his 1st 3 years. At one point Tannehill and Luck were tied for most sacks in first 2 or 3 years of career. 

If your oline can't keep up, you won't have anything resembling a run game. Likewise if you're immediately getting sacked, no way your receivers are finishing their routes. Look back at highlights from those years and his best plays always involved bootlegs or scrambling out the pocket. The only year we had a competent(and fairly deep) offensive line was 2016, and we went to the playoffs.  There is a reason wins aren't considered a QB stat."

2nd, and piggybacking on this comment, you have immigrants, who may not understand signage or road rules. 

3rd you have elderly who should probably not be driving.
