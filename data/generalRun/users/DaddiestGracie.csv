AskReddit,fgv6btk,t3_f0hzfu,1581138442.0,Not taking no for an answer. I sometimes like when guys ask again. But when it comes to them being obsessed with whatever their asking for that they don’t take no for an answer it’s creepy.

AdviceForTeens,fgv3zzz,t3_f0lgg9,1581136485.0,If you want more friends you can join a club. Overtime you’ll start getting closer and they’ll want to hang out. It took me at least a 3 weeks to get solid friends. But if i didn’t join a club I probably wouldn’t have any.

(Mental illness) someone doesn’t just rip things and be rude to people for no reason. But, did you ever do anything to make her upset? Has she always been like this? You can call the police for verbal abuse. I suggest doing it. If she hits you then definitely call the police."
AskReddit,fgp8zwh,t1_fgp8jnd,1580999766.0,"Yeah, I don’t really think people get it. I just grew up that way.

xboxone,fgnovq8,t1_fgnoc8p,1580949646.0,"Lol. We were all in 9th grade then. So we were younger. Kids my age tend to say whatever’s on their mind. But I grew up with parents that taught me to think before si speak and actually have conversations instead of one wording people. I guess I was awkward with them cause they outcasted me when we were hanging out at the amusement park. We were walking in a group and they barely talked to me. I tried to start a conversation with them but they would one word me so I just resulted in kinda giving them space. We ended up getting split up somehow and I just decided to go home cause even after texting and calling they would just leave me on read. Then they sent videos of them saying I was too friendly, and I looked like king tut. Which hurt but it’s whatever. I just wish they could have been nicer."

AdviceForTeens,fgnlrcn,t3_ezhs9a,1580947585.0,"Well first of all saying I love you shouldn’t take like 6 months or whatever. If you both are ready to tell each other you love them then it’s fine. I’ve dated people for like 2 weeks and started saying I love you. Also no I don’t think you rushed the break up. Maybe. It seems like the relationship got boring. You maybe stopped giving her love and affection, or maybe she stopped giving you love and affection so eventually it got boring. That’s normal. I personally think it was a good idea to break up with her. If she was questioning the relationship she probably would have caused you problems too in the long run if the relationship kept going. I’d work on yourself for awhile and just not date until you’re absolutely sure you want to again. That’s just my point of view. But you do you. Trust your gut I guess."
worldpolitics,fgmydel,t1_fgmrsil,1580934317.0,"The biggest problem we have is the media. The media makes problems even bigger. The media lies and tells people different things. Also when famous ish people start supporting ideas and different politics others start to follow in their place. I don’t necessarily support trump, but I don’t believe he’s a terrible president. He’s done some good and some bad. Just like every president has."
AskMen,fgmst54,t1_fgmshjn,1580931332.0,I’m not angry. Its just I hate it when people complain about something their loved one is doing but they don’t tell them. From what you said i assumed you never told her that you would like her to wash the sink when she’s done with the dishes. Just be patient with her if you aren’t already.

xboxone,fgm27cc,t1_fgloiu5,1580916482.0,There probably is. But they sent two videos. And it was the one girl and one of the guys who told me they were talking bad about me. That’s just the story from my part.
dankmemes,fgl8h4j,t1_fgl2mwq,1580885776.0,Idk why you got downvoted. You’re right. If you look at an Asians skull their cheekbones tend to be higher than whites and blacks. Also their eyebrow bones are higher. You can see differences in every skull.
xboxone,fgl7ua6,t3_eyy0d9,1580885078.0,I met 5 people on the Xbox. Two girls including me. And 3 guys. After about a year we decided to meet up.

AdviceForTeens,fgkr2wp,t3_ez0nkl,1580871725.0,"Middle school bullshit. Middle school isn’t important at all. It literally does nothing. It barely prepares you for highschool. But anyways, it’s just drama that will be forgotten in no time. I think you should try to talk to her(the weeb) and try to explain things. Also she shouldn’t be in a relationship with him. He sounds super toxic. Everyone in middle school always follows the popular people. So once you explain yourself things will get figured out. Ignore the people that don’t believe you, they’re just ignorant for no reason and they won’t get anywhere in life. If nothing works out in the end I suggest just working on yourself. Making yourself more mature. And I promise highschool gets better once you find your friends."
