SelfAwarewolves,ff4ztrg,t1_ff40tp3,1579576455.0,"The Paris Accord would damage our economy and when we refused to sign it we still rolled back our emissions, not through the government stepping all over free markets but through innovation.  Take Net Carbon Capture for example, our natural gas plants down in Texas have begun to utilize this and now the plants that do use the waste the produce to power itself.  No emissions.  No lost jobs.  Why not really look into tech that will make Coal Mining, Fracking, and oil drilling safe and minimal risk to the environment?  It's as if we all collectively agreed that technological development has come to a stop and now we must shut all of those forms of energy down.  Why not pressure car companies to make engines that have mpg of over 100?  They buy up the patents as soon as they hear of those engines all the time.

Edit: I'm all for getting along with Europe but time and time again they have shone to be completely inept and hypocritical, bloated and ineffective, too much government, the EU is a sad joke of what it originally set out to be."
