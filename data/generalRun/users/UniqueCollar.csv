preppers,ff8cr4f,t1_ff89tzs,1579673165.0,Reactionary prepping. Like impulse buying. Hard on the wallet with very few long term benefits. Don’t take big picture into account. Impossible to prepare for every eventuality. Better approach is to set a minimum general standard for yourself and aim for that. Can’t be buying radiation coveralls while being $10k in debt. Prioritize and execute.

But I think most of these people will (attempt to) eventually leave the wood and join the convoy of other ""normies"" heading for the big city. If nothing else, the gear they have will wear out and require replacement which means resupplying at the closest open REI/MEC/Walmart."
preppers,fezkzlz,t3_eqxoff,1579458442.0,"Bugging out or evacuating means leaving your current location with enough sustainment to temporarily or permanently relocate. Leaving your home town for better career opportunities on the other end of the country is like bugging out in a non-emergency scenario. Leaving your region for a neighboring state because hurricane Katrina is coming is like bugging out for a natural disaster. Organizing your life to get away from an abusive spouse and relocating at a friend's place temporarily is like bugging out because your life might be in danger.

Rational evacuation plans have the end goal of staging yourself and your resources in a advantageous position (moving for career, school, spousal abuse) or a position that is more advantageous than one you might find yourself in (natural disaster, spousal abuse).

I think when most preppers talk about prepping for wilderness, they're talking about having to transition from one developed location affected by factors outside of one's control to another unaffected developed location. In North America, which is sparse compared to Europe, it can mean having to travel for hours by car or days by foot if roadways are not accessible/damaged. I think this is also why prepping as a phenomenon is more common in the USA, especially in rural communities; a big part of the nation was founded on pushing the boudaries for greener pastures.

I believe very few here imagine running into the woods and building a fort as a permanent base they will live in long term."

Having the bare essential non-food items in a sealed containers would give you step up in reestablishing elsewhere. There are videos on Youtube on making sealed PVC cache containers.
