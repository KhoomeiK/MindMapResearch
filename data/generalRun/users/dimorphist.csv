samharris,ffen682,t1_ffe7926,1579855441.0,"> the white persons personal experience is just as salient as the black persons personal experience. Both are anecdotal, but they both have perspective that the other cant have.

I mean, in theory, yes, but in practice white people are far less likely to know what racism actually looks like, no?

> The argument boils down to the intention, world view and thought process of the white person that's committing the ""racist"" act, which is likely to be better understood by another white person than it is by a black person.

It’s likely to be better understood by a white person that has themselves been racist, yes, but not otherwise, I think.

Also I think the intention of the act can often be confusing. People saying things like, “why don’t you go back and fix your own country,” or “Obama wasn’t born in this country,” probably don’t hate black people in general. If you were to look directly into their minds, you probably won’t find a specific racist intention, but they are treating black/brown people in a way that would never occur to them to do to a white person I.e. an unfair racial prejudice/bias.

How would you classify that?"

Completely agree. I guess where we differ is just that I don’t think she implied that. I am starting to saw how you see the interaction differently than I did and I’m beginning to see it a bit differently too, but I still think that in a situation where two people have declared a certain thing to be true and neither of them have given any reason, and particularly when one person stopped the other person from speaking to do so, it’s relevant to say, “hey, it’s easy for you as a white person to look around and think racism is over, because you don’t experience it.”"

I think I said it can have that affect, which is a far cry from this. It will be hard to have a discussion if you don’t read what I’m saying, dude.

That aside, I’m not sure what to say. He interrupts her strongly. She starts talking louder to finish what she’s saying, but he doesn’t allow it. I call that shutting someone down. It really doesn’t matter what she says after that because the subject has changed and he’s inserted himself at the centre of it. It also doesn’t matter what I think about the truth of the subject because I’m aware I could be wrong and I’m interested in having discussions about it. He clearly was not. You appear to not willing to have that discussion either."
samharris,ff96ryu,t1_ff94vcv,1579706175.0,"Hey, I’m sorry I suggested you were being disingenuous. I can see now that you’re being honest with me. I was genuinely second guessing that for a second.

I still think you’re grossly mistaken. The crux of our disagreement has 2 parts. The first is I don’t think it’s bigoted or racist to mention their skin colour in a criticism of them. For instance, if there’s a black separatist group, calling them, “evil black separatists,” isn’t racist. The problem is the “evil” and the “separatist” part. You are free to disagree.

The second part I think is whether it’s a fair assumption to assume a wealthy white man doesn’t know what it’s like living as a minority. It seems inconceivable to me that they they would know. Are you saying that this is an unreasonable position?"
samharris,ff93xzo,t1_ff93eke,1579704258.0,"Ummm... discussion of white privilege can have the effect of shutting white people up, which is problematic and is why I’m against bringing it up constantly. But it’s not the purpose.

The problem is, white privilege does exist, right? Assuming you agree with me, there will be a context in which to bring it up. Look, I think she’s wrong about the Meghan Markle issue, but instantly shutting down people when they try to talk about it is also wrong. He didn’t let her speak. He didn’t let her elaborate. He immediately shut her down without giving a valid reason and the crowd cheered him on.

Oddly this is the exact context I think it’s valid to bring it up."
samharris,ff92m4v,t1_ff91jhi,1579703316.0,"It’s interesting seeing our different perspectives in this. I think if we continue we’ll keep going back on forth on what was meant and what people’s intentions were, which neither of us really know.

My only 2 real contentions with what you said is:

a) He does interrupt her as she’s explaining herself in the beginning. So he doesn’t allow her to give a reason. This is exemplified by the fact that they both start talking over each other and she repeats herself to try and be heard as seen in your transcript.

b) She doesn’t take issue with his skin colour, but with his privilege and she explicitly says this is because he has no relevant experience. I personally feel it’s disingenuous to suggest otherwise when it’s laying there in your transcript."
samharris,ff91n3h,t1_ff913j7,1579702599.0,"That’s fair. I’m against these kinds of call outs for that very reason. The problem though is that the person’s race is actually relevant here. I think it’s fine to say that something is not racist and have a valid reason, but he dismissed her out of hand without having any valid reason at all.

I would never respond like she did personally, but what she said, that white men don’t have relevant experience, is technically accurate and pertinent."
samharris,ff90b5t,t1_ff8zdt8,1579701570.0,"Oh okay. Well this is sort of my point, your problem appears to be any mention of white privilege. You just don’t want to have that discussion."

I think you missed my point. I’m saying that you previously said you were assuming that she was going to go on an indent Italian spiel, but now you’re saying it’s an example of one."
samharris,ff8z3b7,t1_ff8ydco,1579700604.0,"I don’t see any clear way to tell where there are interruptions in your transcript dude.

From what I can tell your transcript is incorrect. The first thing I hear Fox say is, “it’s not racism,” which he says while she’s still speaking. You don’t have that, you just have- ugh... it doesn’t matter. I’m happy to chalk that up to a genuine mistake.

I’m not sure she needs to elaborate anywhere. He dismissed what she said without any facts about the situation to back it up. It was just a declaration. It’s completely appropriate to tell someone that has never seen a duck before that they don’t know what a duck looks like."
samharris,ff8yq45,t1_ff8xfvc,1579700307.0,"No, they’re not saying that. This is not what was said. You’re creating a straw man in an attempt to obfuscate the topic."
