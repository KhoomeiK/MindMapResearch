This response needs to retire. My brother says the same thing when I criticise his anti-feminism memes. Jokes cease to work if their is no truth to the claim. For a joke to work, someone needs to believe or understand the reference.

The 'joke' is massively dated in that it requires a belief or understanding that being 'gay' is bad.

In a current world where being gay is normal, this joke is either in bad taste or meaningless. If you break it down, it becomes ""this is worse than two people kissing"". It is a shit joke."

They haven't though. If you have 30 minutes, I  recommend this video. You can play it in the background while you do things. Potholer54 is phenomenal at digging through material, going directly to the sources, and laying out the material. He also provides everything in his descriptions.

Articles and in some instances public officials are bad about passing on bad information. These are the things that the public remember and account for ""scientists being repeatably wrong"".

The amount of times I've typed ""Elizabeth Warren controversy"" into Google is astounding. People don't like her or Bernie Sanders and I don't know why. Is this my bias? Both these people appear to be the best people morally running. People bitch about politicians being conmen and then when what appears to be phenomenal human beings run, they are scummy.

AnthemTheGame,ffbj04u,t1_ffbehhb,1579767547.0,"It was discovered early on that EA gives a lot of control to it's developers. The only real contribution EA had was convincing bioware to keep the flying.

If people were honest with themselves they would accept 2 things. One, bioware probably should not have used the snow drop engine. Its complexity slowed production down significantly. Two, everything Anthem was aiming for, were things bioware have famously been weak on.

Bioware is known for their stories. The game mechanics beyond plot do not compare to competitors. They are not bungie. Bungie does shooting extremely well. With punchy guns and a great deal of replayability with mission structure. People take this and misconstrue what I am saying as ""anthems gameplay is shit"". It isn't terrible, it just isn't nearly as good as the division or destiny 2. Bungie went from good gameplay from Halo right into Destiny. Bioware went from dragon age/Mass effect into Anthem.

Showerthoughts,fe1bz17,t1_fe1a2rr,1578824796.0,">Now, could it still be easier? Absolutely. But ironically, not through either of the methods you mentioned (simplifying tax rules or mandatory education). A much better improvement would be to allow the government to do your taxes for you, and then mail you a form for you to check or amend. Lots of other countries do taxes that way, and it's far easier, cheaper, and doesn't collapse the byzantine system of incentives and counter-incentives that a complex tax code is meant to ensure. And yes, it is the tax prep industry in the US that prevents this from happening. So you can still be mad, just be mad in a slightly more effective direction.

Personally, the government either needs to simplify taxes to the point that it takes no education or pay for people to be educated. It doesn't matter how easy you think it is because people still manage to fuck it up. Because people fuck it up, there is an entire industry in place to help people navigate the system. The system is fucked as is."
