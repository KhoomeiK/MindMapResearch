Remember, when we were under klopp for the 1st 2 seasons , we dragged top 4 qualification to the last day, with 76 and 75 points iirc? Essentially 2 ppg. Chelsea is now at 40 games after 24 or 1.67 ppg... That is below 70 points... Leicester is at exactly 2 ppg.

Streamers just kinda screw this up because they just go, hue hue let me start my stream and tada I stream for 8 hours.

But things like, planning take time. They have to curate what games to look at. Each time they stream 2 hours, it will easily take 3 or so hours of each person's time for sure. They have to prep, set up the studio etc. They have to do many other things that being in the office entails. They have to prep for the podcast.

If you are a purchaser of pc parts, this is a frequent issue that comes up. I can't just bring a hard disk to any country, I have to bring it to the country it comes from. Some brands offer international warranty but those are the exception and not the rule.

Even for apple, where they do not have apple stores around the world. This used to be an issue where the official certified repair shop, meaning the shop that apple tells you to bring the locally bought device to if it has issues would not fix it unless you pay, when I tried it in the past.

Homing shot is very good because that is one less thing to pay attention to so that may be a good way to just deal damage while learning patterns.
