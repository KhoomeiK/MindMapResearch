i just kind of put it into sections; columbia is the top left one, venezuela top right, guyana is the the left one in the small 3, suriname is middle in the small three, french guiana is right in the small three, ecuador is on the equator right next to peru and columbia, peru is eating ecuador, brazil is huge, argentina is big and next to chile, chile is skinny, uruguay is squished between brazil and argentina, bolivia is the bigger landlocked one, and paraguay is the smaller landlocked one.

as for central america, i based it off costa rica because i visited there. costa rica is costa rica, nicaragua is above costa rica, panama connects north and south america, honduras is above nicaragua, el salvador is a little one off to the side of honduras, guatemala is above honduras, belize is a little one off to the side of guatemala

as for the islands, cuba big, jamaica off on its own, haiti left, dominican republic right
