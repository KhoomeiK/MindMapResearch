I wish I'd made more of an effort to challenge my anxiety, gotten out more, made more friends. As I said, I don't have a lot of friends, but the few I do have I met in college, and they're just the coolest people.

Don't get me wrong, it may be tough at times, but maybe it won't be as bad as your anxiety suggests."

Are you serious?!"", followed by, ""I can't believe you haven't seen/done that."" I realize it's something people do in jest and don't necessarily mean it, but it really gets to me.

I've been trying to figure out what I'd say if I was called out for it, but even if I was totally honest, would they understand? Someone needed help, and I couldn't even bring myself to just ask if they needed anything. I feel like there's just no excuse. It's moments like these that make me wonder if I'm actually making any progress."

We would rather put issues on a good-bad binary than try to understand their underlying nuances. Unfortunately for us, the issues we struggle with most will require complex, nuanced, and thoughtful solutions, which is why our lust for the simplistic will lead to our downfall. Rather than work together to improve the lives of our fellow human beings, we will continue to bicker over trivial issues and lunge at those who disagree with us.
