cats,fg0zq56,t1_fg0z10l,1580418153.0,It hurts my heart how freaking cute she is. She's a rescue who clearly had been abused and I can't even imagine how someone could hurt her. https://imgur.com/a/EPmmOFb That's how she starts out most nights or lays with me during the day if I'm reading
cats,fg0ynfq,t1_fg06612,1580417606.0,"I often get woken up by the sound of my cat licking her lips right in my ear or she'll stand behind my head and just start purring very very loudly. When I turn my head to look at her, she licks my forehead once after booping me with her cold wet nose, then she headbutts me until she receives the appropriate petsies."
milwaukee,fg0l8jx,t3_ew8bnm,1580410052.0,Welp....I'm only going out in bubble and even then only to my doctor appointments. Having next to no immune system sucks SO bad.

cats,ff1zcc7,t1_fezmxjx,1579489705.0,This looks like my friend's cat watson. He's adorable and fat but has super smelly farts. He's got kitty diabetes. I think his diet is going well though
youseeingthisshit,feypth2,t1_feymjjr,1579448953.0,"I'm a woman. Not a neckbeard. I call you little one because you're behaving like an angsty preteen who is pissed off that someone did something even remotely ""uncool"""

youseeingthisshit,feymbaj,t1_feylsta,1579447522.0,You're so cute with your anger and hatred of other people's sense of humor. It's okay little one. One day you'll learn to live and let live.
youseeingthisshit,feyllcs,t1_feyg2a5,1579447231.0,When you grow up and leave high school you'll realize people like different things and life is much easier and more pleasant when you're not a prick and let other people enjoy the things they like. No one is forcing you to consume this content.

Damnthatsinteresting,fedoyeo,t1_fedc3ba,1579016731.0,"If I didn't have insurance I'd be dead for sure. I'm a transplant patient and just one of my anti rejection prescriptions is over a grand a month without insurance. The shot I'm on to keep my immune system suppressed to keep my lupus in check is 3k a month for 4 shots, without insurance. Our country has a ""if you're ill and not wealthy, you deserve to die"" attitude. I don't think anything could convince me otherwise"

tifu,fdihfhb,t1_fdh6il3,1578442987.0,That's when you either 1) laugh in their faces and watch their misery as you say something along the lines of at you getting laid and not them or 2) get their manager for being disrespectful slackers.
tifu,fdih6yq,t1_fdi0a45,1578442833.0,That is fascinating! And good knowledge to have
