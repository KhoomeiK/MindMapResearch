askcarsales,fdsf5eg,t1_fdre9ih,1578701321.0,"To me the insurance does not sound like a good deal. The first 36 months the thing is covered by manufacturers warranty. So you are paying $2k for only 24 months of coverage. Chances are nothing will happen and you will be out 2k. If something does happen, do you really expect a repair greater than 2k?  The only time this is a good bet is if you expect a greater than 2k repair between 60-100k. 

I imagine it would be better to take the 2k and put it in the bank. If anything happens you pay for it out of the 2k. At the end of 60 months you blow the 2k on something fun.

Edit:  I’m reconsidering what I wrote. If you drive 20k miles/year it may be a good decision. At 20k your manufacture warranty expires in under 2 years.  So this is 3 1/2 years of coverage."
