Yes, I understand what the word portrayed means. Thank you.

You're talking nonsense though. By far, BY FAR the most popular PORTRAYALS of pirates has them hunting buried treasure and chasing after The Lost Boys.

The reason pirates are viewed favourably is because they're never even portrayed as pirates. Just a load of adventurers out to wreck the protagonists' shit whilst talking in funny voices and generally having a laugh."

Hahaha you silly cunt. All you're doing is making a semantic point over and over again that I've already agreed is technically correct. It doesn't matter if you're referring to a genus, a species, a sub-family. You can try to make as many semantic distinctions as you want. You're still wrong.

Wow. I didn't think you could prove me so right.

Nobody uses the word panther to refer to the genus. Read the link you posted. The word panther is not used. 

[https://a-z-animals.com/animals/panther/](https://a-z-animals.com/animals/panther/)

That's what people said before WWI believing that there was too much trade between the major powers for a war to happen.

Tensions aren't as high between the major powers as they were JUST before WWI but the US's move is pretty unprecedented. The entire definition of escalation is tensions get higher and higher and that's what's been happening the last few years. Something has to happen to reverse this trend.

Diplomatic relations between massive institutions are not as logical as you might like to think. You should listen to the first podcast in Dan Carlin's series about WWI. Their was a point where negotiations seemed to spiral out of everyone's control simply because there were too many forces at work.

In fact, none of the things you listed are actually a motivation for a war. Just a reason for an escalation.

The underlying mood at the time was ABSOLUTELY determined by some of the older imperial powers starting to lose there influence and Germany growing in strength and especially population. Germany was wary of being surrounded by so many old powers and judging by their actions, very much wanted to go to war because they thought 1914 was their best chance.
