AskReddit,ffmd7jr,t3_eu725g,1580052733.0,"I was in first grade on Long Island, NY. My teacher was going over something (irrelevant now) and got a knock on the door from what I’m assuming was another teacher. She gasped and turned on the tv in the classroom, and we saw a building smoking. Then she turned it off, and the room was silent. Then the loudspeaker came on and announced we were dismissed. 

When I got home 20 minutes later, my mom was sobbing on the couch watching the news. I saw the same smoky image, only this time both buildings were smoking, the image we’re so used to now. 

My mom was sobbing because she’d worked in the WTC in the late 90s. And because my dad was an NYPD officer and she couldn’t get ahold of him. That day was terribly traumatic for her I’m sure, until later in the afternoon when my dad called to say he was alright, but that he’d be working for an indefinite time. 

When he finally made it home a few days later, the relief was palpable. You could feel the air in the house lighten up. 

He worked for months after that, 20 hour days. He doesn’t really talk about it much, but he’s told certain stories here and there."

I think I know how I'll address the owners of the ~~terrorists~~ dogs that bit Goose. It's a little unconventional, but I think it's a good way to go about it. I want to gift them 2 leashes. Just walk to their door, introduce myself, apologize for yelling at the woman, ask them if their pups are okay, and let them know what wound up happening with Goose. I'll make sure to include the cost and severity of the vet care he had to receive. But then instead of asking for money, I'll offer them the leashes and say, ""I just hope that you'll keep your dogs on the leashes from now on, and hopefully this doesn't happen with any other dogs in the neighborhood. Is that fair?""

It's an appeal to fairness and it will totally catch them off guard, while also being a good neighbor. Who knows? Maybe they have a couple hundred bucks to give me, or maybe they'll just keep their dogs on the leash, which in the long run is worth it, I think."

I would love to be able to walk Goose without a leash, and in a perfect world I would totally let him. But I know that for multiple reasons (including him running into the street with a car coming) that's a terrible idea. I also understand why people are afraid of dogs, and that's another reason I keep him on a leash next to me. I'm very lucky that he's well trained.

NoStupidQuestions,fffbikx,t3_et6mos,1579880317.0,">When I was being taught how to use commas throughout primary school, the teachers always said to use commas at points when you would typically briefly pause during speech, that's not the only rule I follow when using commas, I also use them after some conjunctions, like 'however', or when I'm adding extra information, like I'm doing right now, and I'm sure there's more rules too.

This should be multiple sentences. There should be a period after ""typically briefly pause during speech."" Then ""That's not the only rule I follow when using commas"" could end with a semicolon "";"" or a period.

>Oftentimes, when I'm writing informally, I'll make a concerted effort to use fewer commas, just so it seems more natural and fitting to the casual context, even if it seems grammatically incorrect to not use the comma, but just to be clear, that's not the case right now, currently I'm using commas wherever it seems correct.

This one is fine except for the last clause at the end. The way it's written: ""That's not the case right now, currently I'm using commas..."" Should be either a) ""That's not the case right now, as currently I'm using..."" or b) ""That's not the case right now. Currently I'm using commas..."""

I'll agree that it's likely American soldiers could lose lives in a ground war with Iran, yes, but what's more likely is that Iran surrenders before it begins, due to 1) The strongest military with the greatest, most advanced equipment the world has ever seen (even better than the 2002 American Military) and 2) America's current economic standing, which POTUS has proven to be even more effective of a weapon than any bomb or rifle.
