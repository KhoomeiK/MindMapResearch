When one party can be painted as a rapist, you need to be able to clearly define the circumstances which lead to it.

This is just the normal definition of rape though, and even then, if one party is so inebriated that they do not have the capacity to take responsibility for their actions (by consenting), and the other person forces themselves on them because they are so drunk they don't realise, why should they suddenly have the capacity to accept responsibility for their actions?

videos,fedye31,t1_fedybe4,1579022506.0,The people saying it's rape would probably still want a drunk-driver to be prosecuted for running someone over though. Totally inconsistent.
politics,fedy7xt,t1_fedxoog,1579022404.0,"If you tell yourself Trump is poorer than a homeless person who only has $10 you are straight up being delusional, it's called cognitive dissonance. You hate Trump, and hate that such a douchebag is in power, so to make the fact easier to bare, you tell yourself he's actually poor. It's textbook. And I get it. But it's not productive.

>Being able to spend lots of money while the money lasts, or while there's cash flow, is not the same as being rich af.

If is when you have generated the money (Trump Towers had a revenue of $665 million last year). All you're saying here is that ""once Trump spends all his money, he won't be rich af"". It doesn't mean anything.

Again, I don't like the guy, I don't have ulterior motives here, I'm just being real."

videos,fedwlgk,t1_fedut2q,1579021424.0,"Bruh, if you seriously find yourself in these situations, you should not drink...drinking to the extent that you don't feel as though you can consent was YOUR doing. Drinking is a PERSONAL CHOICE. Getting shit faced is a PERSONAL CHOICE. If you consent to sex whilst shit faced, and you chose to get shit face, then you have consented to sex, my dude. No way around it. Getting your drink spiked etc are obviously different kettles of fish, but if you can't predict how you will behave when you make the choice to get shit faced that is 100% on you, and you shouldn't choose to do it. You need to re-evaluate your stance, you're acting as if everyone is walking around drunk like it's our natural state, in which case, then yes you would be 100% correct."

Big game shooting is meh, though - I'm morally against any action that derives pleasure from harming animals. You can't really be mad at someone for big game shooting if you are a meat eater (both are done for pleasure when meat free options are equally availably), which most people are, so if this is someone's only reason for disliking him, I would say most of those people are being hypocritical/morally inconsistent."
LoveIslandTV,fedtt16,t1_fecwmm3,1579019743.0,There will certainly be people who virtue signal about mental health whilst also engaging in insulting behaviour. Hopefully a handful of those people will see this and reflect a little bit.

If someone calls you a racist for merely discussing an issue (assuming you actually aren't racist), you can cite any of the above links saying ""this is what your willy-nilly accusations of racism lead to"". The goal is to get people to understand that loosely throwing the ""racist"" term around has real consequences. If you know with good faith that you are arguing from a position of logical consistency, and have the means to defend your views without getting emotional, please do."
