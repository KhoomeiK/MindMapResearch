MadeMeSmile,ff2fcmm,t1_ff1l7y7,1579503776.0,"I heard once that you shouldn't use sharpie on hardhats because it could compromise the integrity of the hardhat. All the stagehands I know have some sort of wording or drawings in sharpie, we'd all have to get new ones."

DiWHY,fe3kg3p,t1_fe3cosg,1578850113.0,I hate that etsy has so many people selling cheap manufactured items and then claiming they made them. It makes it harder to find true gems.

Because if it is the first one why didn't she lock the damn door!
UnethicalLifeProTips,fdloosv,t1_fdlntma,1578528845.0,"Good point! Well then, I guess I would snitch on a friend if she was cheating on her man. Hopefully I wouldn't have some skank bitch as a friend either so..."
UnethicalLifeProTips,fdl9vb3,t1_fdkxk3e,1578519526.0,"Not saying other occupations would make it ok but depending on the deployment it's a little extra shitty. Like, I know you might die over there but hey your woman will be fine with some new man..."
UnethicalLifeProTips,fdkucy8,t1_fdktfja,1578511335.0,"Ha! I guess it's the same for anyone but it really gets irritating when you hear people complain when they cheated because their partner ""didn't have time for them"" and that person was busy being an ER doctor or some other important job."
UnethicalLifeProTips,fdkofnt,t1_fdkiqmy,1578507809.0,Absolutely not snitching. In what universe is cheating ok? Especially when it's a soldier.

AmItheAsshole,fct96gr,t1_fct3i0h,1577936236.0,So the mom (sister) was a destructive child and her children are destructive too? It seems like she never learned how to respect the belongings of others and definitely isn't doing her kids any favors!
Unexpected,fct0ky3,t3_eihak4,1577929770.0,"I guess it depends on how they are raised. The alpacas I've met were always poorly mannered but they were mostly wool producers so not handled that much. However the llamas were always super awesome, except for fair llamas because people spit on them and that will make anything angry."
Unexpected,fcrrlvk,t1_fcrbkmo,1577905675.0,I had a couple llamas we were raising as sheep guards and the neighbors dog got into their pen. They chased him down and tried to stomp him to death. Scary!
