eagles,feut5nl,t1_feunnqy,1579389666.0,"Even if it takes 3 years to develop a good WR I still think that’s too long, I would argue eagles are a few players away from being super bowl contenders again right now. In 3-4 years from now we will have an aging O line which is already aging, Cox 3 years older , Carson 3 years older (hopefully still healthy) sanders will be off his rookie contract and want a large pay raise and ertz and goeddart (the best TE tandem in the league) will be aged and perhaps 1 will be gone by then also. I think eagles are in a win now situation more than ever before , that’s why I don’t think we have the luxury to draft a WR late and Develop him, I think we need a stud WR now so carson has a go to guy that he can form instant chemistry with and take another shot at the bowl while the pans still hot."
eagles,feunjwm,t1_fettft7,1579388268.0,"Exactly , that’s why I don’t see Tampa holding onto both those WRs, there’s no way they are going to commit that type of money to one position."
eagles,feuidok,t1_fetd6uj,1579386824.0,"Imo we don’t have time to wait to develop a good wr, eagles are in a win now situation and imo they need to take advantage of carson In his prime and get him as many weapons as possible now not wait to hopefully develop a wide receiver in 4 -5 years down the road. I do agree about Amari though, I wouldn’t pay him 1 money like he’s probably going to demand."
eagles,fetb6uh,t1_fet5l9i,1579373553.0,"Any good WR is going to be “expensive”  but that’s the chance they need to take. I agree AJ has been a bit injury prone of late but if we can get him at a discounted rate Bc of those injuries I’d be all about giving him an opportunity, when healthy he’s been consistently one of the best wrs in the league. As for “no chance in hell” with the bucs trading one of those 2 guys I think there’s a VERY good chance in hell, Godwin mainly. He’s due to be a UFA after next season and will be looking for a HUGE contract extension in which the bucs simply won’t commit to when Evans is already one of the highest paid WRs in the league. I think the birds could put a nice package together for Godwin which would have to include some Draft picks and then hopefully we can resign him during the season at a friendlier rate and lock up one of the best young WRs in the league. Use the agholor money towards Godwin."
eagles,fet4xt1,t1_ferx6en,1579371822.0,"I can tell u what I don’t like about it , we still don’t address the WR void , imo WR CB and LB are the 3 biggest needs and I don’t feel comfortable with our fix at WR being a 2 Nd round draft pick. That’s just me though. I’d be more interested in trying to get a guy like AJ Green, Amari Cooper or trying to trade for Mike Evans or Godwin. There’s no way Tampa is gonna be able to hang onto both of them along with the emerging Perriman."
