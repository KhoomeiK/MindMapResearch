2) My eldest had a bully at school, mostly just this kid running their mouth. We talked about how while words might hurt, they are just words. We also discussed empathy and sympathizing with this kid as they had no friends and had changed schools before due to behavioural issues. Things were cool and they even tried including this kid at recess and class groups.
But then this kid started getting more and more physical up to the point of shoving heads into lockers. The school gave the same bullshit lines as this association, ""well what they are doing isn't right blah blah blah zero tolerance blah..."" and nothing was done with this kid. Eventually I told mine that if this kid hit or shoved mine into a locker, just turn around and kick them in the junk as hard as they could or jab them in the throat. They would get a suspension, but I would have their back.
Some kids simply need their victim to hit them back just once in order to smarten up.

I'm trying to wrap my head around how lax your laws are about ending a human life over a tv."
todayilearned,fc7q3n3,t1_fc7pq7d,1577515730.0,So when do you get to decide when someone is about to burglarize a house and face shoot them?
todayilearned,fc7okky,t1_fc7lk3v,1577514412.0,"That is still insane that one could kill an unarmed burglar. Hell, I once wandered into my neighbour's townhouse beside me to pass out on the couch after the bar. That definately does not constitute a bullet in the face!"

Watch plea bargins and half assed trials disappear."
todayilearned,fc7apq3,t1_fc663uj,1577502030.0,"Canadian here. We have a few monsters living up North and some of us want the death penalty back. I'm conflicted, as I agree with what you said yet I do not like seeing people like the criminal in this story get a lifetime of free room and board and hot meals on my dime.
So, I propose giving the choice to those convicted. Life in a box or a bullet in the heart. Then both sides win, as the death penalty is there but nobody is forced to die."

And would (1) allow you to shoot someone in the face because they threatened to punch a cop?
Or am I missing something here?"

worldnews,fc6oau2,t1_fc6kxj1,1577485353.0,"I don't hate the rich for being rich, I hate them for  not paying it forward to those who made them rich.
If I had 50 billion, or course I would have my mansion and set my entire family up for life. Then I would take the leftover 49.5 billion and pay the fucking taxes on it to do my part to pave the roads. THEN, even if a 70% wealth tax were imposed, I would take the remaining 14~ billion and build low income housing, finance mental health, start a charity to help people get job training to leave McDicks and own a home someday, do all the things governments shit the bed on for the lower and middle class. And while I do all this, I would ask no favors from the government or companies in order to push my own agendas.
And I'm Canadian and just thinking about Canadian problems, nevermined what the uber rich could do for the absolute shitshow that is the US.
Lets step away from the uber rich and just look at the rich. How much per movie are top actors making for under a year of work? Think of what Robert Downey Jr. could accomplish by putting every penny he made on the last Avengers movie into social programs. And that is just one grossly overpaid person!

The problem with the rich, even those like Gates who do things to help people, is they are selfish."
