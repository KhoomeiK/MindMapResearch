cats,ffi59me,t3_etrxtz,1579965444.0,wow. Ginger females are quite rare!
AmItheAsshole,ffhradc,t3_etpcsj,1579949756.0,NTA your aunt is just a snowflake
cats,ffgn36f,t3_etitdy,1579910077.0,same! maybe they want to mark their scent on it
unpopularopinion,ffgmxus,t1_ffgmsgq,1579909975.0,it’s unfair on the children though.
unpopularopinion,ffgmwco,t3_etiu0y,1579909945.0,"i totally agree, i’m saying this as someone who’s got conditions which were obviously passed down from my mother. I hate living with it. However people think this kind of thought is eugenics and unethical"
AmItheAsshole,fffxsap,t3_etf80a,1579894131.0,ESH i think you had to right to tell her to leave considering the way she spoke to you but calling her a cunt and making fun of her stuttering is too far. Overall you should have just told her you refuse to serve her because she’s being disrespectful
IllegallySmolCats,fffo0m8,t3_etdq0i,1579888073.0,ARREST HER
FemaleHairLoss,ffdssqf,t3_et2q23,1579828026.0,nope it looks fine
AmItheAsshole,ffdso5s,t3_et2rnp,1579827930.0,You’re not pushy at all? yeah i definitely got that vibe from your post. YTA
cats,ffdafk5,t1_ffczd8k,1579816618.0,yes i got it from wayfair :) it’s surprisingly quite big so do check if you have a big enough corner to put it in
unpopularopinion,ff9r6up,t1_ff9kmgz,1579719279.0,it’s implying which is clearly what your intention was. Nothing wrong with asking but there’s a difference between asking because you want a gym buddy and asking because you’re subtly trying to tell them they’re fat.
unpopularopinion,ff9i5kl,t1_ff9hyya,1579713527.0,whooooop there it is
unpopularopinion,ff9hplx,t1_ff9gc1k,1579713256.0,"And you’re still disagreeing with the original post which is the problem, you clearly didn’t get OP’s point. Fat people don’t constantly need to be reminded of their weight, there’s a reason why eating disorders exist."
unpopularopinion,ff9fpzp,t1_ff9fcmi,1579712040.0,"Well a lot of the times when people comments on someone being fat and needing to lose weight, they don’t actually know if the person is making the effort to lose weight or not. Fat shaming may have positive effects but there’s also negatives, so it’s best to keep your comment to yourself unless the persons health is really deteriorating."
unpopularopinion,ff9f679,t1_ff9evxa,1579711702.0,"You don’t know anything about OPs life, what if they’re actively trying to lose weight and become healthier? then your comments are not needed because they’re condescending and discouraging"
insaneparents,ff8sprz,t3_esaxug,1579694623.0,"this is absolutely insane omg, that woman needs to be jailed"
