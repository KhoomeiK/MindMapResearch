worldnews,ffkymib,t1_ffkybxy,1580031485.0,"I thought only for a day or so before symptoms appear. If this is contagious up to 14 days before symptoms appear, that's going to mean lock downs and quarantines for REALLY long periods"

worldnews,ffkvrjl,t1_ffktztl,1580029880.0,"Yes - because people without insurance or with shitty insurance won't report it or get treatment. And also those without health insurance are probably working tough, low-wage jobs that they don't get sick days for, so they'll show up to work sick instead of getting fired. Then, everyone else gets sick, but none of them can afford to miss work either so on and on it goes."

Yeah... that's not good."
askscience,ffhhncf,t1_ffhfb18,1579935654.0,"Thank you for the source.

I'm curious about their measurements of confidence level. More in a theoretical sense because I taught philosophy for many years and love epistemology.

From the article, it does indeed sound bad. Maybe we'll just be lucky and be able to tamp it down before a really awful mutation happens and is able to spread.

The article didn't mention incubation period though, which I've seen estimated at 2 weeks. That kind of scares me the most because even if you lock down the cities now, so many could already be infected and be all over the world and won't be showing symptoms for another week.

Also, is it only contagious when symptoms are showing? Any ideas about that?"
worldnews,ffefcdd,t1_ffea3dz,1579845866.0,Don't they think it has like a two week incubation period? That would seem to make it extremely difficult to contain.
