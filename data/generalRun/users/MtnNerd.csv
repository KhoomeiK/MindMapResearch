I've learned to go out and have fun by myself and I have some casual friends to hang out with. I have a boyfriend now who gets me and that helps a lot. 

My big advice to go do stuff for fun by yourself. Go to movies. Go to restaurants. Want to see a concert? Go to that too. You can get amazing seats when you only need one ticket. 

Join a social club around your interests and go to events where you can meet a lot of people. Even if only 10% of people like you, meet a hundred people and you will have ten friends.

And be proactive about asking to come along to things. When you are the second tier friend you don't automatically get invited you have to ask. 

Also invite people to things and keep doing so even when you fail. Even cool people have things like work which will keep them from saying yes. 

Keep at it. It's not easy but that's life isn't it?

Also animals can be great because they don't give a shit about your social skills and they let you cuddle up to another living being on a regular basis."
