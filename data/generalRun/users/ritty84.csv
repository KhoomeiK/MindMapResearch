WatchRedditDie,fevx1ui,t1_fevwihu,1579402554.0,"You're not seeing the facts I laid out because you won't pull your head out of your ass. Just go back and read. And yes that is correct, pitbull is not a breed. Fact. Shouldn't you know that? Isn't that what you do for a living? Are you any good at your job?

What are you even going on about?"
WatchRedditDie,fevw139,t1_fevvrt7,1579402147.0,"I gave you facts, you gave me your feelings. And I don't give a fuck about your feelings."
WatchRedditDie,fevu3ry,t1_fevq8yx,1579401522.0,"Nope. Not at all what you did. You took what I said, knowing what I meant, and turned it around to fit your narrative. You're bad at this."
aww,fevnfz7,t1_fev588u,1579399335.0,I agree.
aww,fevmguw,t1_fero3yo,1579399100.0,Thank you so much for sharing that. Sorry for the loss but I’m glad you have such great memories!
WatchRedditDie,fevby30,t1_fevac0d,1579395579.0,"Your cognitive dissonance is showing. You’re twisting everything I said to fit your already made conclusion. Also, according to the American Temperament Test Society, pitbulls have a temperament passing rate of 86.7% which is lower than Golden Retrievers."
aww,feuv2l1,t1_feusiqk,1579390259.0,What's the issue? People post what they post.
WatchRedditDie,feusews,t1_feuj93z,1579389478.0,"The ASPCA, the real experts, do not recognize any difference between a pitbull’s potential aggressiveness and any other breed’s capacity for violence. However when a pitbull does bite, it can be fatal because of their strength and determination. Dog bites from smaller breeds go unreported a lot. 

And it's pit-daddy."
aww,feuag8s,t1_feu7ocq,1579384693.0,Haha that's great. What a mush!
