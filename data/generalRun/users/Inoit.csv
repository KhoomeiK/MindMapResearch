worldnews,fferz11,t3_et8nin,1579862649.0,"Pretty good speech. It won’t matter a twit. The GOP are slaves to their Lord and Master Trump, and are scared of his stadiums packed with the howling minions he’s so proud of. There are GOP Senators who can’t see they are jubulantly hanging onto the running boards of a car that is speeding downhill towards a cliff. Some GOP Senators are thrilled with the speed and arrogance of driver Trump, who is racing through danger signs posted, busting through rules and wooden safety rails, because, like teenagers out drinking with friends, they gotta stay in the bully’s circle.... OR ELSE... (you’d think this red flag would be enough). 

The sober, smarter Senators know the journey with Trump is not gonna end well, but they need a few other GOP Senators to grab the wheel, another to hit the brakes, grab the keys, another to subdue the dangerous populist behind the wheel. Will they do it in time, or be forever immortalized in the halls of shame? Will they keep this great country from going off the cliffs? 

All Trump really wants is someone to stop him, so he can go back to his millionaire lifestyle. He’s flagrantly “acting out” to get the reprieve he cannot ask for."

Some of the ideas put forward by the film industry, TV and movies, have BECOME our icons, ie, how we view Californians (they’re all surfers and talk like valley girls), to Texans (they all ride horses wearing 10 gallon hats), to New Yorkers (hedge fund managers partying in fancy clubs). TV showed us in the early 90’s weekly series how women make good detectives, attorneys, DA’s  and judges. Back when there were hardly any. It felt strange back then and surprising (now 25 yrs later, many of these positions are held by women). Maybe in 25yrs the gender switch for these fictional characters will not feel so startling.
