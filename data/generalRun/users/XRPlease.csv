facepalm,fehrhxk,t1_fegvy6c,1579122426.0,"It's not a switch that's going to flip and kill millions of people. I don't really know a good metaphor for it, but it's sort of like an AI that is learning how to reproduce itself. At first, the AI is simply becoming stronger and more adept in its processes. Before it is fully self aware of its ability to create more of itself, you could pull the plug, but you don't. You let it improve and improve and improve, then suddenly, it is done. It seems like nothing has changed as the system creates a copy of itself in one robot. No big threat. That robot creates another robot. No big threat. Those robots create copies, who then create copies, so on. You can't pull the plug. At some point, there is no stopping them.

As this relates to climate change, think of us in a stage where the AI is already replicating in robots, but there aren't many. We can't pull the plug on the process and the robots have done some damage, but there are still few enough robots where we can destroy them and prevent annihilation. You probably won't be killed by robots, but the odds increase every day that we let their power grow. Some people who live in less fortunate areas are more likely to be killed by robots. Sooner than is comfortable, they may start encroaching on other, safer areas to live where the robots are less likely to go. Afraid of sharing increasingly limited resources, you may have to go to war with other groups of people to defend life-sustaining food and water. They won't all be primitive, though. Some of them will come from countries that are heavily armed. You won't be able to put up a fence to stop them, they have nuclear weapons. Using them further inhibits both their AND your chances of continuing civilization as we know it, but what choice do they have? Fight you for a chance to live, or accept their own death.

Again, this is probably not going to happen for decades, if not centuries. But then again, I'm no expert. It might be sooner. I wouldn't bet my soul against the majority of millennials living to see a world in which we war for resources other than oil. Widespread famine is the inevitable future of the planet, whether climate change devastates us or not."

>Do these idiots even realize an average person has to worry about getting good grades or working to have enough to eat or even feed their family

this is just madness. Getting good grades would not be prioritized over a meaningful contribution to reducing climate change, if one could actually be made."
