aww,fgixeu9,t1_fgivo4l,1580832951.0,"So, coyotes are my favorite animal and I've been reading about them since I was around 7. Coyotes don't do ANY of that, and a very short Google search will confirm that for you.

Coyotes do not hunt in packs unless they are starving. They do sometimes hunt in pairs, however. They maintain small family groups (which can be called packs but are not the same as a wolf pack, it is really just a family) and are solitary hunters (even when in a family, the family does not hunt together except for very extreme circumstances). They do not ever lead animals into an ambush, and in fact usually only eat rodents and insects. If they eat something larger, it is very rare that they were the ones to kill it. They will, however, attack domesticated animals because they tend to put up almost no fight. (Sheep and chickens mainly.)

A coyote will also attack different based on what animal they are attacking. One of the reasons I love them so much is how fucking clever they are. They will actually learn the best way to attack something and do so.

In fact, in most cases, Coyotes attack dogs because they see them as competition, not because they are hunting them.

You seem to have mixed up urban legends with truth (coyotes luring dogs), wolves with coyotes (hunting in packs), and cougars for coyotes (attacking the back of the head, which makes no sense at all for an animal that doesn't pounce on large prey).

Also, to expound on your true statement about coyotes not luring animals: the few times it looked like they did that, it was actually just a coyote retreating and the dog being too dumb to leave it be.

Either way you are going to, short term, hurt the servers. It's true. But if you refuse to tip, you are only causing pain and nothing will ever be fixed, ever. If you refuse to participate, you are doing two things: one, you are making it so that the restaurants can't really skip out on meeting the pay gap, because it would be happening to too many servers. Two, you are causing the employer to lose money, which is how you actually affect change.

Honestly, the best BEST way is to make it illegal to pay such a low wage. I personally like that, but I also lean liberal. If you want to fix it in the boundaries of capitalism, then refusing to eat at a place that doesn't pay minimum wage is the best way to do it. OR, find the restaurants near you that pay a living wage, and eat there more often. Show the stingy employers that you CAN succeed paying a living wage, and maybe more restaurants will follow, if only for the good image it brings.

But, you are right in that both of our arguments reveal the same thing: the current system is fucked up and it's not an easy fix.

And you're probably right: if it was an honest mistake to not tip, taking it out on OP doesn't help because OP probably already feels bad about not tipping and the server just ensured that OP won't be delivering a larger tip next time to make up for it.

What I am saying is that the whole thing is shitty. But in the US, the company is NOT going to pay the difference that they legally owe. That sucks, but it is the truth. Ask any server. So when you stiff the server, ALL you are doing is hurting the person that served you. That is the only person that suffers.

And since what you would be doing is denying someone income so that you can eat a slightly fancier meal, yes. I think it is morally wrong. If you REALLY want to make a change, you need to refuse to eat at restaurants that don't pay at least minimum wage. If you want to make a bigger change, refuse to eat at restaurants that don't pay a livable wage. There does seem to be a movement in the US for newer, small restaurants to forbid tipping and instead pay $15 an hour; eat there instead! But most people aren't willing to do that, and so this shitty, shitty tipping culture continues.

And also, this is an anecdote so definitely take it with a grain of salt: all of this arguing about ""poor people not tipping"" is not true in my experience; the people that come in super careful about prices and commenting that they don't have a lot of money, in my experience, tend to ALWAYS tip. It's not always a great tip, but they always leave something. The people who tend to stiff servers, or even worse leave a fucking dime, generally seem to be the people that order big.

If you tell your employer that you made less than minimum wage and could they cover it (which they are legally required to do) they will do so... and then they will find a reason to fire you a few weeks later. I waited tables for quite a few years, and I have seen this happen several times. I do not know of a single person that asked for that coverage that didn't lose their job within a month.

I DID only work for pretty big chains, I won't lie. I really hope mom and pop restaurants and fancy, non-chain restaurants actually do provide that coverage.

What does that have to do with anything? If you refuse to pay in a country where you know that they exist on tips, you're an asshole. If you don't know, then you're less of an asshole, but your ignorance isn't going to put food on someone's table.

But you better believe all of the servers talked shit about you in the back if you didn't leave a tip. And if you think I can't hide it, that's fine. Whatever level of hiding I was able to do, it was enough to get me money to live on so I'm not complaining.

Your girlfriend is right, you need to grow up and learn how to clean. Because I can tell you right now, a person can only take so much of your shitty cleaning before they start to remember how much easier and cleaner life was when they lived alone.

Regardless, if you want actual advice it's this: take a month or so and let your girlfriend dictate the cleaning. Do it like she wants. Get over yourself. At the end of that period, you'll see that KEEPING a house clean is a lot easier than MAKING it clean, and you'll appreciate it more. If not, then you two really shouldn't be living together because here's the sad truth: you will not ever convince her that she'll be happier living in filth. It won't happen.

ChoosingBeggars,ffcf1t5,t1_ffcdoug,1579798067.0,"Okay, so let's start off with this: I think we agree?

The reason I bring up ""at-will"" allowing firing for no cause is because what generally happens is that you get fired and are told it is for poor performance, sometimes even told that when you brought up that your tips were under minimum wage it opened their eyes to your poor performance. If you try to make a case out of it (which I only saw one person do) then they essentially counter with ""poor performance"" which is very hard to prove or disprove in a restaurant. Citing tips as proof of poor performance helps the restaurant. Also, I think I worded poorly there: every one of them got the difference they asked for, and were then fired. No one was stiffed.

And the state does, at least in Mississippi and Texas, tend to just say, ""Oh well, we don't see any proof that you were fired without cause."" I suppose if you planned ahead you could probably prepare a case by gathering evidence of your good performance, making sure that there is proof you asked for the difference, and then showing how close together the dates were. But no one I know has tried that before because we were all making so little that it was better to just eat the lost pay and try to bring up your tips.

Anyway, I wasn't saying it is a legal loophole. I'm saying that restaurant owners are jackasses that will screw you over with the slightest provocation, and that they will usually get away with it.

The other employment problems you mention I can't really comment on. I only know about the things screwing over visa workers because my girlfriend and most of her friends are working here on visas from Latin American countries, and so I get to hear the stories of the things that they, their friends, and their families are forced to do because, ""if I don't, they can fire me and I will be sent back to my country."" And since they have pretty good jobs (accounting and such) I doubt I even hear the worst of it.

Either way, I am sorry if my past responses caused offense. It sounds like we both believe the same things, even if we said it different ways."

And please reread my comment. I started off by specifically saying that on paper and theoretically it's true that they have to cover it. In practice THEY DON'T. I can tell you this from having seen multiple people fired for trying to enforce this rule. I can also tell you that most people didn't even KNOW that rule, because management never told it to us.

There is a difference, often, between what is legal and what is done anyway. In the actual real world, people are fired all of the time in a manner that is not legal, and it goes by unnoticed. And for restaurant workers, it's super easy to pass the FMLA: you can absolutely be fired for poor performance legally. Performing poorly can lead to less tips. Therefore, they can argue that you were fired for performing poorly as evidenced by your small tips.

Yes, again, it is illegal. But it happens anyway. And if you want to go further down the rabbit hole of ""BUT THAT'S ILLEGAL HOW CAN THEY DO THAT?"" start looking up how the US treats non-citizen employees on a visa."
ChoosingBeggars,ffc9yum,t1_ffbuc4r,1579794897.0,"> Tipped wages work a little differently, but you’re still required to pay your employees at least minimum wage once tips are included.

In theory and on paper, yes. In practice, nope. I waited tabled for many years, and not a single one of them paid me anything to cover the difference between minimum wage and my tips. In fact, I have seen multiple people suddenly get fired for ""poor performance"" within a week of notifying the manager that their paycheck was less than minimum wage that pay period.

There are always servers to replace you, and since every state except Montana can fire you without cause, you're not going to get that difference. Especially since management will always claim, ""They were let go because they didn't perform well enough. Look at their tips, they weren't up to minimum wage even!""
