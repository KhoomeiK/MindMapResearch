>People who deny others their gun rights tend to be mass murderers

Who told you this information and why do you believe them? Is every government except America's run by mass murderers? Do you think that's why you're not allowed to own guns in any non-shithole countries? Are school shooters mass murderers when they vigorously exercise their second amendment rights, or are they not mass murderers?"

Because it had to be compatible with both USB and the original iPod connector, Firewire 400, which they implemented years before mini USB existed. So why did they use that, and not the similarly sized USB B? Because Firewire 400 was 30 times faster than USB, and wouldn't be surpassed until USB 2.0 came out years later."
