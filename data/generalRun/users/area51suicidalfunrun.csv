Considering all you've put here it sounds like Carrie has time for friends just not you. And theres a very big chance that the reason she wants to step away from your friendship is due to the same toxic Christian ideas that forced you to leave your Church.

Good on you for being a good parent and loving your child for who they are. There are parents out there who would have caved to the pressure of their Church group, but you didn't.

I'll be honest with you, hearing what they heard likely really hurt your parents. However you're being honest with them of the why you won't. Having kids is a choice. It is a lifelong commitment. Your reasons for not wanting kids are entirely valid. It probably wasn't smart to tell them this at a family event like this, but you aren't an AH for wanting to be open and honest with your parents or even your entire family. Also being pressured into having a kid isn't fair, especially when you and your partner already agree you don't want to have kids. 

I think you should find a way to sit down with your parents and explain to them that you are grateful for them and your siblings, but you feel like youve already helped raise enough kids in your lifetime.

Going from an exorbitant amount of calories to a healthy amount per size, age, gender and activity levels can be very difficult because your body feels hungry even though it isn't. Or the person is misidentifying thirst for hunger, which is entirely possible if one drinks a lot of sugary sodas or energy drinks and the like. (Because sodas and caffeine dehydrate the body despite adding liquid and calories and thus the body craves more water, but people mistake the thirst for hunger) 

If you hydrate properly and give your body proper vitamins and nutrients and follow calories in calories out, then the body does a decent job at demanding appropriate amounts of calories. 

Not to mention I feel we are grossly misinformed (as Americans) about just how much calories are in certain foods.

I only make these suggestions because I know people with severe skin conditions who have used CBD or hemp ointments that have helped! Or even just a specialty lotion for excema.

There have to be times throughout the day where you do wash your hands, so perhaps try implementing a lotion after those times and see how it works out?

And to comment on the indoor outdoor (though I know you asked not to)
There are very many cats like this. Especially if they were feral at any point in their life. my ex rescued a cat from the Bronx, she would come inside now and then or go in their garage in the cold, but this cat HATED living inside! We tried to bring her with us to our apartment and she escaped and almost attacked me when I tried to bring her home. (which was not very common for her she was extremely docile)

They had a really lovely yard with a ton of hosta plants and, a koi pond and a really pretty garden. So she just loves to hide out in the plants and be outside. She just loved it. 

Currently my sister has two cats. The male cat was a feral that just walked into her house one day. He comes and goes as he pleases now and finds ways to escape when they try to keep him in. 

Even my indoor only cat tries to escape from time to time. He's only gotten away once but has gotten out at least 3-4 times. In the summer I try to take him outside with a harness ( we get coyotes, bears, foxes and the occasional mountain lion in this area, along with hawks, occasionally eagels and other large prey birds, so I just don't wanna take the risk)

Cats are animals. Animals instinctually like nature. Cats like to hunt and bathe in the sun. A true feral cat has a lifespan of 5 years. You allowing your cat to be an indoor outdoor cat has severally effected her life in a positive way. She gets the benefits of outdoor life and getting to fulfill wild instincts while also having a safe and warm bed to go home to and a nice meal waiting. If you live in an area that doesn't commonly get larger predatory animals then it isn't a problem to let them be indoor outdoor. (Though I know plenty of people who do let their cats out regardless of local predator animals) the only possible risk would be getting hit by a car. So long as you're a responsible owner (and for all intents and purposes you do sound like one) it's not an issue. 

Perhaps look into a neon harness though? They make ones with reflective stripes too! Which will increase your kitties chances of being seen in the dark and thus decrease the chance of being hit by a car!"

What is your SO's opinion because you said she was entertaining the idea. Have you spoken to her about it and really listened to what her ideas on it are? 

It seems pretty dumb to turn down a house that they're willing to buy for you just because of the different ideologies. Stop using political disagreements to not like someone and try to find their redeeming qualities despite the differences. They're still your SO's parents.  (There are other reasons to turn down the house though)

Expecting you to uproot an entire life out in a state that you are well established in seems rather fly by night. Not only that but if they truthfully wanted to help you in regards of buying a house they'd actually help you and not just do it for you. Buying a house is a major milestone in your life, and a big commitment that means a lot to a couple. So I can understand not wanting that taken away from you or worse getting settled in a home that you don't own that you aren't paying into. Because if you aren't paying into it, like you stated you could be kicked out at the drop of a hat. It also truthfully only builds up their assets and not your assets. Meaning, god forbid her parents die and run up a ton of debt before they die, that house would be an asset to be liquidated. Also if the house is in their name it would be theirs to sell, vs. if it was in your SO's name and your name it would be yours to sell and profit off of. It would be different if they offered to help you buy a house and help you build up your own assets, then I'd 100% say your the AH, but from what you've written that's not the case.( It sounds like they want to outright buy you a house vs putting a down payment for you and having you guys pay a mortgage, let me know if right or wrong on that) 

Lastly your mom is right and you could've been much more tactful. It was a really hurtful way to say that. They might have different opinions and express themselves differently than you but they likely miss their daughter quite a bit. You don't have to take their offer but you don't have to be rude about it.

Now obviously this is not that case. You need time to heal. Post-partum issues are very difficult to deal with, and you taking some time in alone to bond with your baby in a space you feel safe and comfortable in is extremely necessary. 

The reason your parents see the kids daily is because you live with them. they will likely give you your space or at the very least be there to swoop in and help when you and SO get overwhelmed.

Relax and breathe. Try and continue to explain to your SO that you need time because it's healthy for you and for the baby. the baby is still going to be there after 2 weeks are up. But considering the implied past of abuse in this post, you should tell him that once a week is too frequent and that she needs to visit when you are comfortable with it, not at her neck and call.

AmItheAsshole,fdrc38o,t1_fdpbh6v,1578682399.0,"OP did state Amy and Allen did get together a week after they broke it off though. Babies can come early and can come late. With a timetable like that and with that short of a window you wouldn't really suspect much at all. Especially if she wasn't aware of the pregnancy going into the new relationship. No one finds out they are pregnant the second it happens. Some women have irregular cycles and can go 2-3 months before they find out sometimes even longer. 

It is totally possible and plausible for OP to not have questioned the parentage of this kid. Cus she could've either gotten pregnant in the last few weeks of their relationship or even possibly immediately upon getting with Allen. It's also entirely plausible that Amy was pregnant before getting with Allen and had zero clue about it. 

Legally, because im assuming his name's on the birth certificate, Allen was her father. Amy likely questioned it herself at some point, since OP said the baby resembled him more than Allen. She chose not to disclose to her husband that she thought it was possible another man could be the father of their daughter. In fact Amy likely would've never contacted OP about it had Allen not died a young man's death. 

OP isn't an AH for not wanting this. He didn't want it then and it's understandable to not want it now. So I'd say NTA, because realistically the AH here is Amy. You don't just come to a realization like that over night. If she had her suspicions she had them for years. 

Personal opinion is that OP should see if he is the parent and see if he can have a relationship with his daughter in some capacity, but not necessarily the same relationship between a father and a daughter. He doesn't want to erase or replace the man who raised her and that's something i can and do respect. I wouldn't blame him for not trying but I say he should, at the very least."

Boyfriend had to call my boss to explain that I was leaving. Pretty sure boss called my dad cus before I could even get home my mom was calling me to find out what happened. Waited till the following morning to go in. Got turned away because I wasn't a risk at that moment to myself or others with instructions to seek help and a list of doctors they suggested seeing. 

Took two weeks off work and went back. Working all the time made me too tired to wake up for doctors appointments. Nothing like unloading all your issues to a therapist and then having them turn around and dump you as a patient.

Doing a lot better now, almost a year from the hospital incident. I no longer am seeking professional help but getting back into my hobbies and rediscovering myself as a person helps a lot.

There is behavior in and out of work that is considered in professional. Especially in a field like engineering where you need to give out your number quite frequently. Although it is your personal phone this is a work connection and this person should only speak to you in a professional capacity. 

Unless you develop a friendship with a person that exceeds the workday, that is the only time it would exceed work talk. 

I can tell you as a girl who works in a male dominated industry, you will get hit on a lot. Just from simply being the only girl present. HOWEVER, there is a vast difference between a person casually hitting on you, jokingly hitting on you, and crossing the line and making you uncomfortable. This extremely passed that line.

Thankfully I was only ever made uncomfortable once at work, and even more thankfully the guy only did it because he'd been laid off that day, so I never saw him again.

It's no one's fault but Bob's and in a way your SIL. Bob is the one who searched your medicine cabinet. Bob is the one who invaded your privacy and stole medicine from you. 

Yes opiods are a terrible crisis and a lot of people abuse through the medicine cabinet outlet. 

Yes addiction is a disease that is very difficult to over come. And I mean disease in the sense that it is something literally wrong with the physiology that needs doctors or some form of outside intervention to cure. It also requires long term care and therapy to avoid relapse. Opiod users can even experience cravings over a year or more from last use. In fact it is well known that opiod users get cravings randomly after a year sober. It starts as a random twinge of pain, usually in the spine or in the back, what the feel as back pain is actually the last of the drug finally working its way out of the system. 

Addiction is not an excuse to continue abusing drugs. Addiction as a disease does not excuse anyone's actions. He made the choice to search your private home, he made the choice to grab that bottle and put it in his pocket. Temptation is a SOB, and unfortunately Bob fell into it.  

Your SIL should have warned you, if it was realistically this much of an issue. Yes people have the right to privacy for their past, but one year sober is not enough to not have a support network. Especially with opiods. She failed him herself by not telling her sister, ""my boyfriend is a recovering addict, I know you just had major abdominal surgery, is there any chance you were prescribed something for pain management?"" 

It is well known that doctors prescribe opiods after C-section. That is likely why he searched your cabinet. He could have at any point spoken up and told your sister the truth that he took or knew about the pills.

YouShouldKnow,fdktwbx,t1_fdjnyds,1578511066.0,"It's actually a 360 radar, learned this because of cop radars. A good quality cop radar (which is only illegal in North Carolina and West Virginia for the continental US, and perfectly legal in other states) picks up several frequencies. You've got ""X band"" which is a camera or some type of security device usually goes off the most around super markets and big brand stores, and also detects camera within traffic lights. 
Then ""k band"" & ""Ka band"" these are the two types of radars cops use while driving around. I believe one tracks ahead of them and the other is the 360. 
Then ""laser alert"" which is of course the laser gun that they need to be stopped in order to use. They can use the above radars while stopped as well. The laser alert can also go off because of sunlight, I've personally only seen it go off for an actual radar gun a hand full of times. 

If it's legal in your state get one. A good one can be between $200-$300, there are cheaper ones that work just as well, but either way it gives you a few seconds heads up and alerts you if a cop is in the area, it can save you a lot on tickets. (K and Ka band give a couple of seconds notice and beeps more frequently the closer you are to a cop. The laser alert is possible a 1-2 second notice, literally enough time to slam your breaks and prey he doesn't go after you.) 

Cops could give you a hard time about them if they really wanted to. Some people put it smack dab in the middle of their windshield, others put it lower and more discreet. A cop may or may not ask about it when they see it but in my experience they usually don't notice it or don't comment.

My boyfriend actually got out of a speeding ticket because of his. We were driving separately and were passing a truck past the barracks. A cop happened to watch it happen and assumed we were going much faster than we were. (At most 80) my bf has a Mazda speed 3, with a shity exhaust that's been on it since he bought. The cop witnessed both of us pass in our separate cars. (Worth mentioning I drove a Taurus SHO which looks like a cop car) he hopped in a cruiser and chased us down. By the time he caught up to us, him driving extremely recklessly, we had slowed down just about to merge out of the left land for our exit. He came up on my tail extremely fast then went around me on the shoulder, almost hit me and my boyfriend and THEN threw his lights and sirens on.  When he pulled him off the road his car was half on the highway and I merged into the exit just as he threw the door open of his car into traffic. I thankfully avoided hitting him. 

Because of the radar the cop had no choice to admit that he reacted based on what he saw, that he had no type of radar to determine how fast we were going. He gave my boyfriend a ticket for a moving violation and I contacted the state over it.
