> and I disagree that the Goa'uld didn't murder anybody who didn't worship them. They absolutely did. 

I really don't think so. Sure they murdered anyone who voiced opposition to their rule but that's the far end of political authoritarianism. The followers of origin didn't walk into settlements and say ""hey, this is what its like now"". They (had to) force people to actively worship the Ori every day of their lives and if they said no to that, their whole world was slaughtered. That's definetly a step beyond what jaffa invasions usually looked like. But it was the standard MO of the ori troops.

> And the Ori crowd seemed to treat people pretty well if they did fall in line, unlike the Goa'uld.

Well if they gave up their hearts and souls, the Ori really didn't need much more than that, if that wasn't enough. But they had to have used forced labour one way or another to construct all those ships and all the other war materiel. Or maybe they had people brainwashed thoroughly enough that they didn't need to whip them into labouring for their cause. I still feel like they were atleast as bad in the slavery department."

Stargate,fdbfzjr,t1_fdb7roe,1578257029.0,"This is a very fair point.

I'd argue that Teal'C has more going for him morally. He actually took action at great risk to himself and even to his child and wife and rebelled against his masters and then went on to fight a decade long war against the tyranny of the Goa'uld.

And the tyranny of the Goa'uld wasn't as bad as that of the Ori to begin with. While the Goa'uld were slave drivers and overall tyrants, they didn't straight up murder anybody who didn't worship them on the spot when they occupied new territory. And the jaffa atleast didn't burn people alive, unlike the ori worhipers.

But yeah we're playing asshole olympics here I guess. Maybe if there had been 10 seasons of Tomin making amends for his sins I would like him."

Stargate,fdayf4p,t3_ekdybt,1578251774.0,"I really don't like Tomin.

At first all he wants is to crusade against infidels because he's so into the Origin religion (and that's all fair. He was born into it and brainwashed). Then he gets sent off to war like he wants and ends up (as far as I understand) being commander of the Ori ground forces or atleast the forces on one ship. Then he starts to realise that ""hey, we're killing an awful lot of civilians here and that doesn't feel right"". Then he continues to 'do his job' which means subjugating or killing every last person they can for years until one of those people is Vala.

Then he just goes with them and kinda sorta surrenders instead of using his presumably (atleast formerly) high position in the Ori invasion force to try to dissuade his compatriots from their murderous rampage.

His redemption arc is the equivalent of standing at the Nürnberg trials saying ""hey I was only following orders. I didn't like it anymore than you did"".
