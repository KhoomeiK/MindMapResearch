news,ffmrj49,t1_ffmedwc,1580058182.0,Years ago I saw a yellow lab walking on the side of a freeway on the opposite side of the direction I was going. I wanted to exit off the freeway to go on the other side to get the dog but everyone else in the car convinced me that there were plenty of cars passing that direction and surely someone else will stop to help. I had to go to work very early the next morning. I’ll never forget that day. It was dreary and misting rain. As I drove on the highway I saw that same dog from the day before dead on the side of the road. I will never forgive myself for not stopping that day. To this day it still bothers me. Since then I’ve always stopped and try to help. Sadly most times they run and I can’t catch up to them but at least I know I tried.
aww,ffgvtn0,t1_ffgt4xc,1579916349.0,Looks like the dog had his own seat so I assume the owner paid for a ticket. Most likely not a service dog. Of course always ask before touching anyone pets.
aww,fffl7lp,t1_ffewin3,1579886363.0,"I’m so lucky, my two cats were affectionate like OP’s. I could hold them the same way. The two cats along with my dogs would greet me at the door every time I came home from work. They were such awesome cats."
lifehacks,ffbnt5g,t1_ffb5wwd,1579774719.0,This happened to my dog’s liter mate. The neighbor whom I got my dog from allowed the young puppies to roam free in the house. The husband crushed one of the puppies in under the recliner. It was horrible.
pitbulls,fethcr5,t1_fesghv6,1579375485.0,Same thing happen to us when we adopted a sickly lab mix years ago. After some time with medical care and prescription diet and 30 additional lbs he was a different dog with a different color coat.
dogpictures,fej98b3,t1_fej5dfb,1579162423.0,I had a childhood friend who had a Samoyed. That dog was an escape artist who constantly managed to get out of the backyard. The neighbors were used to it and always brought the dog back and put him in the yard when the family was not home. One day my friends family came home and to their surprise found 2 Samoyed in their yard. There just happened to be another Samoyed wandering in the neighborhood and the neighbors thought it was their dog and just put it in their backyard. Good thing the 2 dogs got along.
sewing,feig6n5,t3_ep99cl,1579137774.0,The dress is beautiful. It’s so wonderful that you are wearing your moms wedding dress on your special day. I’m sure it means so much to you both.
todayilearned,feictah,t1_fei5ap1,1579135503.0,You are right it is everywhere. I’m in the west coast and on most part major cities are pretty diverse. But in some rural small towns there is racism but a bit more subtle. Such as not so nice looks and unwelcoming lower levels of service. But I’ve never seen the out and out open racism like rural south where people are yelling out of cars and porches and threatening to shoot people of color as stated in the comments and witnessed by my friend who lived in the south for a period of time.
todayilearned,fehw53k,t1_feht17j,1579125052.0,Exactly. Some cities are a bit more progressive than others.
todayilearned,fehqsx8,t1_feh11gx,1579122027.0,Sadly racism is still live and strong in some areas of the South. Especially if it’s a smaller town. My childhood best friend’s parents are originally from the South. She grew up west coast. She moved to the South to care for her sick father. After he passed away she inherited property there. She eventually moved back west coast and said she couldn’t handle living there with all the racial tension. She told me people still sit on their porches and make loud racial remarks of black people as they walked by.  Hard to believe we are in 2020 and it’s like time stood still back there.
dogpictures,fehildt,t1_fehgotd,1579117282.0,"Ear infections are pretty uncomfortable. If you suspect your dog has one , you should have a vet look at it a as for gets meds.  I’ve never had one clear up on its own with my dogs."
IdiotsInCars,feg5zcz,t1_feg1xyl,1579078526.0,I was driving behind a lady who had left her purse on the roof of her car.  I honked at her several times but she ignored me.  When she finally stopped I said her purse was on the roof. There was no thank you but got a dirty look that I had bothered her. There was a moment that I was thinking I should have just let her loose her purse.
dogpictures,fefk551,t1_feej1ez,1579058031.0,I’m so sorry for your loss. I really understand how you feel. In 2 years I lost 3 of my 4 dogs. The last 2 passed away within months of each other late last year. I have the one left and it’s so quiet in the house now. No more constant shadows and tripping over the gang. My remaining dog is hitting 12 in a couple of months. Every time he coughs or breathes funny I’m in a panic that something is wrong. I don’t think my heart can take anymore.
aww,fecztce,t3_eohdxm,1578991598.0,My little dog’s favorite spot to sleep was that same spot right behind my legs. For 7 years I had the comfort of him right next to me. He recently passed away and I really miss the routines we had.
aww,fecylnh,t1_fecjxb8,1578990002.0,Me too. There’s one currently posted on my lamp post on the edge of my yard. It’s been there for months and peeling off but I don’t have the heart to take it down. I hope they got their cat back. Thanks for making the effort to get the cat back to his owner.

She does not announce to everyone she meets she is gay but she does not hide that she is gay.  I’ve  never known her to seek out an event, bar etc just because it’s LGBT related. She just lives her life."

After seeing that dog fly out the window and nearly get run over, I am so nervous when I see dogs hanging out the window."
aww,fe5wxsf,t1_fe5trf0,1578876787.0,I saw a dog fly out the open window of the backseat when the driver made a turn. We stopped to get the dog and everyone was honking at the driver to stop. Luckily the dog was not hurt. Dog was in the backseat and leaned on the window button and accidentally rolled down the back window.
dogs,fdqxeg8,t1_fdq8h0i,1578676164.0,"He was a chihuahua mix under 10 lbs. His mother was mostly chihuahua but don’t know what his father was. My best guess would be boston terrier because of his coloring/markings, head shape and eyes.  His mother was a pregnant rescue a friend adopted."
dogpictures,fdqukfu,t1_fdqbo5f,1578675139.0,I’m going through this right now. Lost our youngest dog to heart failure a couple of months ago. Our last remaining dog who is older has been in depression. We had lost 2 others dogs previously and he handled it fine. I was quite surprised that he is having such a hard time with this recent loss since he was never close to our youngest dog. We have trouble getting him to eat sometimes. He doesn’t go outside as much and he rarely window watch anymore. He just wants to sleep all day. We have arranged frequent play dates and sleepovers with other family dogs which perks him up some. We have thought about getting another dog but not sure if that is wise either. The older dog has always been kind of a loner. He never really accepted the younger dog.
Petloss,fdnofkt,t3_em6lbb,1578589929.0,"First off I’m sorry you and your cat is going through this. I’ve lost a cat and a couple of dogs to cancer. I recently lost my dog to heart failure and my daughter’s cat has advanced lymphoma. Most important thing to me is quality of life for the pet, which I think is your priority too.  Manage any pain and discomfort with medications. I’m not familiar with the medication you are referring to. However at this stage, I personally would not choose a medication to slow down the cancer if it meant possibly making them more uncomfortable. The best I’ve found to judge when it’s time is by keeping very close watch on changes of the pets behavior. Are they eating or loosing weight. Are they engaging with the family and doing the things they used to do. I think animal don’t spend their day thinking about their illness as a person would. They go on until they can’t. So we need to watch for signs. Decrease appetite, watch for signs they are in pain.  If your pet stops engaging with you and want to hide out my themselves more frequently. Those are sure signs that they have reached the “can’t” point. Rapid breathing can mean difficulty breathing, pain or both. Panting and shivering also means pain. My dogs cardiologist told me a technique to count how any breaths per minute to gage if my dog was having difficulties breathing.  Ask your vet if there is something like that for cats. With my cat needing pain meds around the clock, I timed it so I could go home every day on my lunch hour to give her medication. You know your cat the best.  You will see signs and you will know when. I think with any terminal illness, I would rather make the decision earlier than later if there is any question of your pet is suffering. All we want is what’s best for our loved ones.  Spend quality time and make more memories together with whatever time you have. My thoughts are with you and your kitty."
DOG,fdhrrev,t3_elezd8,1578428903.0,I can’t imagine the pain and suffering this poor dog went through. I hope this good boy is living a pampered and pain free life now.
dogs,fdhpu0c,t3_ele34n,1578427778.0,"Your roommate is FU and it’s not ok what she is doing. Laws unfortunately are not great at protecting an animal for anything else as long as they are getting food, water and shelter. Check if it is legal in your state to video anyone without their knowledge. If possible record your roommate doing some of these punishments and  show it to your local animal welfare or human society and see if they can step in to help. Of course you may not have a roommate after that. But no pet deserves to be physically or mentally abused.

Edit: you might put up security cameras with sound in your home.  Your roommate might not realize what you are doing but think it’s just for home security.  Also if she knows she is being recorded, maybe she won’t be as abusive to the dog."
ExpectationVsReality,fdg9reb,t1_fdfkrsu,1578386189.0,My husband sent flowers to my office. Instead of calling a local florist he used 800 floral service.  My husband paid for a nice bouquet but what I got was a single carnation with fillers and a ribbon with  generic tag “happy secretary day”. It so happened that day was secretary day that I received flowers.  I am not a secretary. Our guess is that the florist made up a bunch of theses for the holiday and just grabbed one out of the fridge and delivered it to my office. We have never used an 800 floral service since that incident.  I am always leery of what actually gets delivered when you place a delivery order.
funny,fda87h5,t1_fd9dq2l,1578242857.0,A friend of mine had 2 Rottweilers. The female had no problems jumping in and out of their pick up truck. The male dog always didn’t want to jump in or out. He was so embarrassed every time he had to pick up his 100lb dog to get him in and out of his truck. He later found out his male dog had bad eyesight and that was likely the reason he had trouble jumping up and down high places.
funny,fda5na5,t1_fd92rnf,1578242024.0,My 8lb dog had no problems jumping up on the bed any time of day except for bed time. When it’s time to go to bed he requires to be picked up and placed on the bed. He will scratch the side of the bed and give you the saddest eyes.
OldSchoolCool,fd71j0l,t1_fd6fi1v,1578198299.0,I love this movie. So much action and comedy. OP ‘s stepdad did a great job.
OldManDog,fd4h5tq,t1_fd43m7n,1578167400.0,"What a beautiful thing you are doing. I wish was strong enough to do what you are doing.  I’ve lost 2 this year within months of each other and it’s taken a toll on my heart. Most recently was 2 months ago. He was what Redditors call my “heart dog”.  He was my constant companion through some very difficult times. I lost him way to young to heart failure.  For the first time in my life, I don’t want to adopt another dog. I hope in time I will feel differently."
OldManDog,fd3px8y,t3_ejyu0m,1578160643.0,I adopted a 13 year old lab who had difficulty walking. I assumed by his age and medical description that I would likely just provide him a final home for a few months. He did not have severe hip or arthritis problems as I was told. He just needed to loose 20 lbs. I ended up having nearly 3 years with him and they were wonderful years. He was such a sweet dog and I still miss him to this day. Thank you OP for adopting seniors and wishing you and Francis many happy times together.
ExpectationVsReality,fcynuhd,t1_fcxp27n,1578083542.0,I’m having lunch and laughed so hard almost spit out my food.  This pic is proof that it’s so important to get a good tattoo artist. LOL
AnimalsBeingBros,fcy5ney,t1_fcy3rex,1578075196.0,Long ago I adopted 2 kittens brother and sisters pair. My dog stayed up all night their first night home trying to keep them in their bed. If they got out she came and woke me up to corral them back to bed. She spent her whole life mother hen the cats.
UpliftingNews,fcxv7wd,t1_fcwsp8j,1578070925.0,"Unfortunately too many people who shouldn’t be pet owners. I adopted my dog from a small town Humane Society that didn’t even have a facility. It was mainly run with volunteers and fosters. I drove to another state to adopt him. My dogs back story is that he was not small enough or cute enough. The owners wanted a palm dog but was too cheap to pay for a purebred and got a mutt instead. That landed him living the first year of his life penned up in a dark garage in the heat of summer and -0 in the freezing mountain winter. How he managed to survive being a small puppy I will never know. A volunteer was able to talk the owners into surrendering him. I got him when he was a little over a year old. He was full grown at 14 lbs.  He had been penned up so long he didn’t even know how to lift his leg to pee. He did this squat thing and pee on his chest until he finally got the hang of it. It’s very sad that people banish unwanted pets out of sight and forget about them.

Edit: I forgot to add that the owners did get their palm size dog. The volunteer who rescued my dog did say the owners had another very small dog in the house but left the dog i adopted in the garage. These types of owners view their pets as playthings not family. Amusing while it is until it’s not then discarded."
Petloss,fcw25x5,t3_ej55tl,1578015409.0,My dog died 2 months ago from heart failure. He collapsed and died right in front of me. I found out from his cardiologist that one of the symptoms of heart problems in dogs is coughing. While my dog didn’t have a chronic cough he did cough sometimes. I just though he had something irritating his throat and thought nothing of it. Now when my other dog coughs after eating I will have a panic moment. I’ve dealt with a lot of different illnesses but this heart stuff is something else. It’s so sudden you are never prepared for it.
dogs,fcv0rmo,t1_fcult57,1577992302.0,"In addition to my previous post, try to get a good diagnosis of what’s causing your dogs problems. Food intolerance, allergies, etc. I’ve had a dog with severe allergies and one that had a GI disease. Both conditions can cause some pretty bad discomfort. My dogs had to be medicated with steroids and diet restrictions. Also there are other meds other than steroids but my dogs unfortunately did not respond to those meds. If it is possible to know the cause you have a much better chance of finding the right food or treatment.  Again best of luck to you."
dogs,fcumecn,t1_fcul4ji,1577984130.0,Thank you for your kind words. He was only 7 years old. Losing him this way when I thought I was doing the best for him is a hard pill to swallow.
dogs,fcuko1o,t3_eiz20p,1577983138.0,"If your dog has a medical condition that restricts them to a special diet then you would have to weigh out the risks to the benefits. I would definitely research more options before settling on the one grain free food. One of the key ingredients you want to watch out for is food with a high content of peas and legumes. Talk to your vet/cardiologist if it is feasible to put your dog on taurine supplement as a precaution. However I read that taurine deficiency is not the only concern with grain free foods in relation to DCM. For 5 years my dog had been on one of the top 3 brands linked to DCM. He died 2 months ago of DCM. By the time I realized the dangers of grain free foods, it was way too late for my dog.  I will not feed my dogs grain free again.  It is worth doing some research and discussion with a vet/cardiologist to check for other viable options for your dog. I hope you are able to find a good solution that is best for your dog."
iphone,fcs0dr3,t1_fcrylj3,1577909402.0,I guess it doesn’t with ATT.  My son got a new Samsung and popped in the sim chip and it worked but eventually had problems with some features because the IMEI on file didn’t match the phone.  ATT had to update the IMEI number on file to correct the problem.  That’s what their tech support told me anyway.
iphone,fcrneit,t3_ei7xpp,1577904089.0,It’ll probably work but you will eventually need to update customer service with your IMEI number of your phone. Your service can’t do updates and certain features without it. You will eventually run into a problem.
Petloss,fcpl7cq,t3_eiem9j,1577866747.0,"My Sammy passed away 2 months ago also. As the new year rang in and all the messages came in, I had a moment of sadness that he was not with me and beginning a new year without him. You take however long you need to grieve and heal your heart."
cats,fcnqed8,t1_fcn1kmm,1577816465.0,My friends boarded their dog when they went on vacation. As soon as they checked into their hotel they got a call that their dog got hit by a car and died. Somehow 2 dogs were able to get out of the kennels and passed the offices then through  the reception area and out the front doors without anyone noticing. Bystanders was able to save the other dog and brought it into the boarding hotel to ask if they were missing 2 dogs. Thankfully my family all pitch in when any of us go on vacation to babysit our pets so we don’t have to use a boarding facility.

nottheonion,fckmk5y,t1_fckku11,1577728580.0,This exact thing happened in my city a couple of months ago. They went through the garbage and found out who the garbage belonged to and cited them. The people thankfully had a paid receipt for the garbage haul so they were spared from the fine. City is now going after the company who dumped the garbage. Get and keep receipts no matter how small the job. You never know when you’ll need it.
nottheonion,fcklsto,t1_fcjttwl,1577728114.0,How about the lazy people who want to get rid of their big furniture like sofa and mattresses. They put it out on the street corner with free tagged on it. But just leave it there for the city to deal with when no one takes the free item.
dogs,fckk5r1,t1_fck1scc,1577727100.0,"Yes, but still worth posting. There are a lot of people who are unaware of this information. I just learned of this condition and the relation to grain free foods less than a year ago on Reddit. I started to read up on it and talk to my vet about the risks. Ironically my dog died in October from DCM. He died within 3 weeks of diagnosis. By the time we found out it was way too late. He had been on food for 5 years that is listed on the top 3 brands linked to DCM. I wished I had learned of this information sooner and possibly saved my dog."

crafts,fcgy8mx,t1_fcfwpmc,1577645262.0,My son learned to crochet just to make baby Yoda as a Christmas gift for his sister. The pattern was way bigger than he anticipated and took him a very very long time. He had many pointers from his girlfriend who taught him how to crochet. They did an amazing job. I was so impressed. I am inspired to try learning to crochet again myself. I have tried many times through books but I think you really need someone to show you.
