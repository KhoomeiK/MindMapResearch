I didn’t use a direct bus, but rather ran a line from the power source to each plug. I didn’t use wall plugs either, I have a large power supply on the left there in the back which allows me to ramp up the voltage and current. Maybe a bus would be better? 

I may have to get a second power supply and break the track so it’s direct/lane. Looking for any help of course."
