ceph,ffgzhrw,t3_etdctl,1579919073.0,"I understand your not wanting to go back to ceph after having a rough time, but we have multiple clusters ranging from hundreds of TB up to 8PB all running size=2. I haven't had any luck with cephfs (lost data there also) but RBD has been predictable for us and generally fault tolerant, even when I think we have lost data for sure it seems there is a way to get it back. We do things mostly in object storage but also do some direct RBD device mapping as well as using cinder with openstack to build vols on. I wish I had an answer for your cephfs issues but I ultimately had to back away and accept the loss of data with our cephfs experiment (it was luckily a POC at that point, and I actually caused the failures that lost the data during testing). We've also not really come to any sort of happy place with EC either so are where we are now.

If I had anything that I could recommend I would... but there's nothing I've seen that can scale for our needs so we're still in camp ceph. Admittedly, it would have to be very compelling for us to make a move at this point. Maybe there's a way you could do things with just RBD in the future, and if you need to gain space perhaps multiple pools with different sizes would be beneficial. For us the 2x size was for cost as well as speed. Using multiple pools you could kind of get best of both worlds.

I'm interested in seeing what other people chime in with here...

Edit: should have waited to submit... anyhow if you have a way to borrow or stand up more nodes to distribute those drives in you could add them (with some of your crashing drives) and just update crush to reflect the change in topology. That would at least hopefully fix your crashing issue and reduce the actual failed OSDs to the ones with legit corrupt rocksdb.

I've dealt with lots of these rocksdb issues and have found that sometimes they correct themselves but often times they just deadlock on startup and crash out so ymmv, but at least getting the others moved would give you access to the data. You could even do a thing where you move a few to a new host, get them up and running, reweight 0.0, and wait for the data to drain off and rinse/repeat. Of course this assumes you have the space to backfill it somewhere. I'll chime in if I think of anything else but above would get you some more data back."

Bonus points for ceph and cinder there, but these are all pretty simple standard and mature services at this point. 

It's cheaper to do on prem but harder and takes people with experience. That's the thing, and at a certain point you need those same people in order to not have a bad time even in the cloud as well since the same issues happen there as on prem, and cloud only people don't really have a basis to start troubleshooting the underlying hardware issues that are happening in the ""cloud"".

I think at a certain point you  break out of cloud either for general cost reasons above, or application reasons below. It really is a size thing though in my opinion. At some point you're going to need the same talent to come in and troubleshoot issues for you no matter which environment you have, so as a CEO/CTO so it's logical to BYO after some scale really in my opinion. I've seen lots of this actually in the last 20 years i've been pretending to do a good job at this. People seem to have been primarily on prem then there was a big rush to cloud, lots of companies just would get started on cloud (this is the big bonus of cloud IMO), then they'd get past the fad part of growth and actually having to buy reserved instances, and then paying multiple 100k per month bills to the point they decide it's time to move to on prem DCs.

Rent a furnished apartment somewhere nice and treat that time like vacation? I have too much stuff so could never actually pull off a place right on the beach, but if I was in your shoes this is what I'd do. Substitute beach for any desirable place in your vicinity...

Slowly unpack from storage and assess what's worth keeping and what needs to go. I've moved a ton of times and always have to do this no matter what. Sometimes stuff doesn't work and you will not be happy till you have it sorted out.

Zillow is great for this since you can draw your map and really focus on neighborhoods you like. Drive around and check out the ones you're interested in and adjust as needed. I was lucky to have a buddy that's a realtor to help on my last home buy but used a referred realtor on the one before and had great results. I'd start interviewing now and just be clear about your timeline. If they're not busy likely they will offer to show homes you're interested in even if you're not quite ready to make an offer.

As mentioned you can pre-approve ahead of time. I'd work on your credit and reduce all your debt to under 30% if you can before applying for your loan approval to get the best rate. There's other things you can do to improve your scores ahead of time as well to ensure you get the best rate but as far as I  know nothing is better than VA loans right now.

Anyhow, I would also not stress about buying before the lease is up if you're looking to buy a home that you plan on being in for a long time. A few months rent is not going to likely be a huge % of that purchase regardless, and is worth it in the long run if you really find the house you want.
