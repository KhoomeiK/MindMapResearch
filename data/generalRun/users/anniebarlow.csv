I've always worked at places where jeans and sneakers are my everyday routine, I never felt compelled to take extra 20min for make up, another 20min if I washed my hair and I need to dry before makeup. Now I work in an Elementary school. Kids don't care what I look like. I'd be putting makeup to impress coworkers who are mostly women or gay men? (And I'm Female straight? Worth the effort? Nah)  

I do look like death most days. I have chronic dark circles around my eyes and somedays they're just that bad that people ask if I'm sick or feeling unwell. Nope, just another night of insomnia.

I've gone through changes in my body in the last year and a half where I lost over 65kg, so my confidence is better and I kinda want to wear makeup somedays, but I dread hearing everyone at work making a comment about it. Everyone has an opinion. And I already go through it with how much my body changed and it makes me feel uncomfortable and a little too much attention for someone who used to be invisible despite my size. 

Back to you, no woman should be forced to wear makeup, doesn't matter the profession, and its time it changes it. Dress codes I agree to a point (force me to wear hills instead of flats and I'm suing). But makeup? This is what my face looks like, get used to it."
