Increased GDP through private sector outgrowing the public sector is how stable economies function. It'd be a slow but continuous process. 

- public sectors held to essentials, education, healthcare, roads and infrastructure etc. 

- remove business rates for 1st 3 years of a company with lease of 5 years or more, a lot of companies here die trying to get off the ground with our system

- remove monopoly status that provide poor service and value  (looking at you Translink)

- some real, and not just IT, but diverse and real paying graduate jobs, our best and brightest know enough to mostly never come back, we need them, they are the forward thinking, economically stimulating and less polarised voices that are constantly lost to better opportunities elsewhere.  

I honestly believe that we have a poverty problem over culture and tribal, I think ""Kulture"" and tribalism are the symptoms of entire areas across all our population having little or no opportunity to become mobile, get a decent job, buy a house, start a family, travel, see the world etc. 

If you're stuck in the same estate, with no way out, limited job opportunities, limited education and a constant surround of the same ideas and voices etc. This place feels like your whole world, and it's understandable when that world seems to change without you or feel under threat from themuns. 

Our politicians and politics (although not all, granted) are a symptom of this, the politics is to keep areas deprived of the above, then the political class can milk their millions in lavish wage, protection, housing, expenses and party funds, built and sustained on the fear that thrives when people's entire world view barely moves beyond the end of the street they were born in. 

I think this place will stop being orange and green, when we're all sick and tired, want a better lives for ourselves and our families, but stay in the country to get it, but realise that themmuns were never the problem."

Steady constant pull, easy to manoeuvre, light enough for a bigger bike. 

My biggest tip is, practice the slow stuff more than you think you need to, it’ll give you greater control, and you’ll be less likely to drop your shiny, new to you, toy. 

Next I’d say, go second hand, everything from bike to leathers, you’ll learn loads about maintenance and mechanics, and can buy better stuff as you go, rather than all at once. 

Only exception, buy a good helmet, don’t cheap out on it, it could save your life. 

Other than that, ride and enjoy. I have done in all weather since I got my license, and winter wise, hand guards, heated grips, waterproof jacket under or over leathers, and good thermal gloves are a lifesaver."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fcs95w3,t1_fcs10mw,1577913222.0,"Not quite what I meant, 

At uk intersections controlled by traffic lights, which include a pedestrian crossing light, they don’t have zebra crossing road markings.

Essentially. Lights control traffic flow, and no stripes are needed 

Stripes are placed on other parts of roads and don’t need lights to be  effective, stripes mean pedestrians always have right of way when they are crossing or preparing to cross.
Lights without stripes halt all traffic to allow pedestrians to cross for a limited period of time, and control both vehicles and pedestrians. 

In the video , it would mean that the kid has automatic right of way, and all traffic must stop to let him cross, it also encourages all vehicles slow down and be observant at these crossing points. 

But that would only be by uk law and traffic codes if they were applicable, which I  doubt they were in this case, given the two vehicles that drive on past while the child is on the crossing. 

 In the imgur picture, remove the stripes and replace them with light controls, and that would be the normal set up here"

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fcrij0w,t1_fcrhhn7,1577902270.0,"As I said laws are different everywhere, not every country puts down both.

For example, replace the white stripes on your image with just lights that have pedestrian crossing signals which activate when all other lights are red, now there’s only right of way to pedestrians at specific times. 

In the uk this is very common at busy junctions, and zebra crossings away from large intersections. 

There’s also the removal of road markings, making it less obvious, these are known as pedestrianised areas, meaning drivers don’t take right of way for granted, and nor do pedestrians, making both more aware of each other.

There’s loads of ways of accommodating foot traffic and motor vehicles, my point is, in this case, it’s a single road, with the kid waiting to cross and being ignored, it’s a recipe for disaster, and by the laws that apply here, (which I highlighted don’t apply everywhere in my first comment) he driver is at fault."

motorcycles,fcr9x3a,t1_fcr8u9i,1577898902.0,"Thought that when I started, but despite the weight difference, cars stop quicker in most cases, 

4 tyres with wider contact patches come to a stop quicker, and with less skill needed than a bike practically doing a stoppie (back wheel up). Anyone can slam the brakes on in a car, most older models even have ABS, panic braking on a bike is less successful.  

We’ve about 2 credit cards with of rubber on the road at any time, and much smaller brakes. 
 
Our advantage is paying a lot more attention, hard to be distracted by texting on a bike, but all things being equal, yea, about the same or longer to stop than a car, with modern cars stopping significantly quicker, and with radar tech as well."
motorcycles,fcr8oi7,t1_fcr83b2,1577898392.0,"Absolutely right. 

It’s easy to get distracted or run on auto pilot in the car, hopefully a bit of a flashing red light in front gives the hint and wake up call, or unaware drivers realise they’re too close.

One thing to keep in mind, cars stop a lot quicker than bikes, and what seems an unsafe distance to you, may not to them, but if I was driving and saw the flashing red, I’d get the idea that you’re uncomfortable, and ease back to give you more space."
