depression,fee89eo,t3_eok6mu,1579028438.0,"Objective that's not true words we gave meaning to can't define reality.
Technically we are above those words and labels we created."
depression,fee7he6,t3_eojiuf,1579027984.0,"You need to do what you at school at home live in the moment and enjoy every bit of it.
Enjoy your parents,your siblings ,your pets enjoy it all because one you might wake me up not have it .
You can't change the past and it can't hurt you unless you let it. It's your mind you can control it.
Do you dwell about what you do at home??? No it's the same thing just reverse it."
depression,fe179tz,t3_enduv0,1578823371.0,"I'm sorry to here that but your not alone in this you never were and you never will be.
Let him go because the more you hold on the more suffering you will put yourself through.
Don't attach to people or certain events you want to happen to determine your happiness.
HAPPINESS STARTS WITH YOU.
Now I know you might be thinking ""who is this person or who does he think he is but I'm telling you the truth only because I do want to help you and I care about your well being not because I know you but because every person deserves happiness.
See I told you aren't alone"
depression,fdxzrl1,t3_emvtuu,1578774594.0,"Whenever you plan to end your life is the time you can be spending making it better.
Stop letting your emotions dominate you and control you it should be the other way around.
It's your mind which to me I consider the greatest gift man has so stop misusing it.
I know life can be hard and I know we all go through hard times but in all of us including you  lays dormant a strength like no other that if tapped into will get you through anything.
Don't throw away your life just because your engulfed in darkness because your not alone and if you are I will be that light you need to get your life back on course and yes I might be a total stranger but every human deserves a happy life including you so let this be the first step towards happiness"

depression,fdwyuuq,t3_emxllc,1578763657.0,"I'm sorry to see you are slave to what I call my greatest gift THE MIND. I read your story and I can't relate in any way to you but don't let the great tool humans have become something that is creating road blocks in your life.
It's yours to control so control and all that is within it.
Master your thoughts and emotion because they affect the world around you.
As you have already got a taste of this with you and your ex."
depression,fdwxtkg,t3_en7336,1578763299.0,"I think you want to have a more full life experience all the highs and lows of life.
I mean what is happiness without a little sadness.
Vice versa.
But you should want to get better though it's not healthy physically or mentally for you to be sad 24/7.
Emotions effect you physically more then you think"
depression,fdsawod,t3_emrpqy,1578698396.0,"Why aren't you happy!!! 
Your celebrating the day you came into existence.
Don't start your year off like this.
I know I don't know your life and your struggles but I do know every person going through something has the strength to turn the tables including you. 
I also know it's not easy and that's just life but I do know it's not impossible and you aren't alone at all because if you don't have no one and you feel your in the darkness well I will be that beacon of light to help you.
Yes your a complete stranger and all but every human deserves happiness"

depression,fdprmpn,t3_em7uw2,1578637848.0,Cut them off
depression,fdm1bit,t3_elqwy9,1578537453.0,"Have I been depressed??? Yes 
But I didn't let it control me and I knew I wasn't taking any medicine or seeing any therapists.
Though the most I ever felt was stress not sadness. 
I never got to the point where  the weight was to much I'm just emotionally strong.
I never cry like ever and only way I do is if I force myself to by focusing on the negative which is just something I can't keep doing.
Usually after a goodnights sleep I'm back to 100% happiness."
depression,fdefgxf,t3_ekpvdz,1578337877.0,"Scared of what???
Everything will be ok you need find the strength inside of you and pull that shit right out you.
I know it's their you just can't see it."
depression,fd33er5,t3_ejvcf6,1578154382.0,"Stop comparing yourself and your life to others. The time you're taking to do this you could be doing something more constructive.
Focus on you and only you. How about you go have a blast with your life and stop feeling so sorry for yourself.
Find your real self and throw all that other stuff away"
depression,fd30kbo,t3_eji660,1578153604.0,"Who said you need someone to not be depressed.
I'm sorry to say but if you think someone is going to magically walk into your life and make you not depressed your going to be waiting for quite a while.
Happiness starts with you, getting better starts with you and only you.
Your not powerless so stop acting like it because I know you and everyone else has the potential to conquer depression."
depression,fczugvo,t3_ejamne,1578108815.0,"I don't cry but it doesn't bother me one bit.
I see it as weakness."
depression,fczmt7c,t1_fcz55tq,1578104657.0,"Completely understandable but move on.
It's hard I know but you can't stay in this state of attachment because it's going end up sending you into a downward spiral. The more you cling on the more suffering you put yourself through."
depression,fcthcr1,t1_fcsicyu,1577943310.0,"You and every other person on the planet have the power to overcome anything.
It's not easy but not impossible it's not a walk through the park no one can instantly make your life better but you by taking control of your emotions and stopping them from controlling you.
Life is something someone should cherish above all else.
Their are people out their that will help pull you out the darkness like me if no one else will I will be that light for anyone just to see a smile on their face."
depression,fctgnl7,t1_fcrcyim,1577942660.0,"Who the hell said you didn't deserve it???
You are letting your emotions rule you and not the other way around.
Just as you dug this hole you can create something miraculous to.
Master your emotions and you have the key that will open the door to something new."
depression,fctg0gj,t1_fcqoqyv,1577942069.0,"Yeah wasting it away.
