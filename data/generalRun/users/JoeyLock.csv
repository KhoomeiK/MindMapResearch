But I also have a feeling that Young-shins backstory is going to explored further, when he offers to guide them in Episode 4, Muyeong recalls how he has more skill than most soldiers in shooting a Tanegashima matchlock and he simply says he ""learnt how to during the war"" (Japanese invasions of Korea) but Muyeong doesn't buy it and wants to know who he really is but they're interrupted. 

In Episode 5 we see Young-shin walk off alone and he walks past a 'Memorial to the Battle of the Upo Wetland', which was fought by Lord Ahn Hyeon (The guy who lived in that monastary with the warrior monks dressed in white and helps them fight the zombies in the last episode) where 500 Koreans supposedly won against 30,000 Japanese but when he walks past he spits with an angry expression, presumably this isn't based off an actual battle as I've never heard of any Upo Wetlands battle during the Japanese Invasions of Korea so we'll have to wait and see what the connection is and why he seems so bitter and isolated."

Worf mentions something similar in DS9 ""Way of the Warrior"": *""I suppose I could get a berth on a Nyberrite Alliance Cruiser. They are always eager to hire experienced officers.""* so there is probably civilian organisations ex-Starfleet officers can join to use their skills. In the character outlines/breakdowns we saw early last year there was a character named 'Connie' who was apparently cast to be 'African American' and her description was: *""Has a quick temper, but is also quick to forgive. In addition to dealing with the loss of her husband, she is also avoiding a death sentence on her home planet. She’s a mercenary pilot who uses her ship to transport people to and from an artifact of some kind, though the ship is massively overqualified for that job.""* My guess is they've possibly merged ideas from the 'Connie' and 'Alana' character outlines into Raffi and probably changed a fair bit from those initial outlines too but its possible she *used* to run cargo or something which might be what the hat represents (It appears to [have a CFHCR or UFHCR written on the badge at the front](https://i.imgur.com/Vwa35Tj.jpg) maybe it stands for United Federation H_____ Cargo R_____), also the mentioning of 'an artifact of some kind' is also the term the Romulans use for the Borg Cube, the 'Artifact', so either they'll introduce another character at some point or they've pick 'n' mixed ideas from all the character outlines for different cast members."

DaystromInstitute,fgrw60y,t1_fgqeg7v,1581059887.0,"> Is... she smoking that flower? I mean this is cool, but why is she doing it? Recreationally? Is it ""snake leaf"" wtf? Why is Raffi living in a ""hovel?"" Like, she lives in a post scarcity world so the only reason she might feel humiliation is because she's lost her job and decided to smoke weed in her RV all day. That doesn't seem like the only option available to her so I'm not sure why this character is the way she is. I don't love this backstory.

Her little crackpipe thing looked like some kind of 'space vape pen' so I imagine given that recreational drug use has become less of a 'taboo' thing in recent years for some reason they're probably trying to be all 'relatable' by introducing space weed to Trek to appeal to the stoners or something. But as for why, judging from her apparent alcoholism, presumable drug use and the rather 'hippy' look to her home where she had like a dreamcatcher outside and hanging plants everywhere and her mentioning how its been going downhill for her over the last 14 years etc I'm gonna guess she's become an alcoholic and druggy because of losing her career and something else, which she'll probably struggle with her addictions and how they've affected her.

Also when we saw the 'Welcome to Freecloud' bit on her holographic screen it had dice and she swiped it away quickly, possibly ontop of her alcohol and drug vices she was also a gambler and lost a lot? She actually says in her conversation with Picard *""I lost my security clearance...I lost....""* but then storms off, my guess is she lost her husband or boyfriend when she started getting into drugs and alcoholism and blames Picard for it all with a sense of denial because she probably realises it was actually her own fault but its easier to blame her old friend for 'starting it all' etc. The reason I say its her husband is the character breakdowns we got back early last year, one of the characters was called 'Connie' who was 'African American' and it described her as having a quick temper and *""In addition to dealing with the loss of her husband, she is also avoiding a death sentence on her home planet.""* Now they probably rewrote the death sentence thing since she seems pretty Human to me but Raffis character ticks all the other boxes and it'd make sense if she was going to say she lost her husband/lover/boyfriend when she looked like she was about to cry but stormed off alone, now if they do go down that route, whether they died as a result of her actions or they simply left her because went into this spiral I dunno. Another character breakdown we got was 'Alana' who was also the one described as a druggy: *She’s a brilliant analyst and has a great memory despite abusing drugs and alcohol. Often times she gets irritated with her own vulnerability and is certain of herself, even when she’s wrong. A former intelligence officer, she sees conspiracies everywhere. Her professional and personal losses weigh heavily on her.""* - So either they merged both those characters into one or we're going to have another character who is the one that lost someone."

DaystromInstitute,fgruw4p,t1_fgopg3i,1581058461.0,"> Either story would be interesting, I suppose, even if I’d personally prefer one over the other, but I’m suddenly terrified that if it was the cabal all along, that will be an excuse to absolve Starfleet/the Federation of any sense of moral responsibility. 

I personally think it'll actually end up like Undiscovered Country, a joint Romulan-Federation conspiracy to keep the cold war aspect going in a sense. Picard has insisted to Raffi twice that *""The Romulans had no reason to sabotage a fleet designed to save themselves""* but *some* Romulans most likely would have a reason.

I'm wondering whether if this Zhat Vash 'cabal' is part of some more Imperialist/Nationalist movement after the destruction of Romulus like the storyline in STO, some pro-Federation Romulans formed 'democratic' style colonies and eventually would form the Romulan Republic, meanwhile the Romulan Star Empire is the Imperialist faction of old die-hards who want to restore the Empire and the way Romulus was. So I wonder if something similar will happen here, it might even give an excuse to bring Denise Crosby back as Sela being one of their leaders as remember her quote to Picard *""Everything in me that was human died that day with my mother. All that's left is Romulan. Never doubt that.""* so I can see her being part of this if it turns out that way like how she was 'Empress Sela' in STO.

So given that the attack on Mars was the reason why the Federation retreated from the evacuation efforts and left the Romulans behind makes me wonder whether theres some anti-Federation Romulan faction that didn't want Federation help, they didn't want the Federation 'saving the day' and 'corrupting' their culture and being indebted to them, sort of how we saw American culture affected and influenced countries post-WWII during occupations, military bases and with the Marshall Plan as it spread American influence, propaganda, culture and American interests to European nations and had reasonably large effects on their individual cultures and way of life from country to country.

So it's possible some rather xenophobic Romulan faction made up of old soldiers from the Neutral Zone cold war days didn't want Federation assistance because of the inevitable 'influence' in the Romulan way of life that would come with it, take for instance the quote from ""The Neutral Zone"" from Commander Tebok *""Your presence is not wanted. Do you understand my meaning, Captain? We are back.""* so if they knew that a major disaster near the heart of the Federation would cause them to become more isolationist and back away then they'd probably take that opportunity. But the reasoning for my thinking it might be a conspiracy is the news interviewer lady says *""Many felt there were better uses for our resources than helping the Federations oldest enemy.""* and *""Romulan lives.""* instead of saying 'lives' like Picard does, so its probable that amongst Starfleet most Admirals would be veterans of the old cold war days and would be very distrustful of helping the Romulans in the same way Admiral Cartwright and Kirk were initially vehemently against helping the Klingons, the old enemy, in a similar disaster scenario *[""They're animals! Don't believe them! Don't trust them! Let them die!""](https://youtu.be/YROjjuPycjA?t=20)* and [how the Klingons themselves feared Federation intereference in their culture and way of life](https://youtu.be/I0ncQup3BOE?t=408) and 'insidious assimilation' [like the classic great scene between Garak and Quark.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VhSm6G7cVk&feature=youtu.be&t=93)"

DaystromInstitute,fg8mvnz,t1_fg74h6n,1580624812.0,"Possibly some kind of cultural or media icon influenced a change? Although in TNG ""The Neutral Zone"" Data claims TV apparently didn't last beyond 2040s, we see 'holos' in Picard like his interview in the first episode, it's possible Data's actual meaning was that 'television' transformed into ""The Net"" and ""Interface"" we see in DS9 ""Past Tense"" two parter, which seems to be television and internet combined into one kind of service, quite similar to whats happening now with direct-to-stream shows like Picard. In the Enterprise episode ""Home"" when Archer and the crew return to Earth after the Xindi crisis, Archer is talking to Erica Hernandez and asks her *""Seen any good movies while I was gone?""* to which she responds *""Another World War III epic. It swept all the awards. But you haven't missed much.""* so movies were still a big thing in the 2154 too. This makes me wonder whether the movie/television/holos industry is actually quite popular in the Federation despite holodecks and just like our real history, fashion is influenced by the celebrities and what people see on holos/tv/movies.

When we think of most eras of fashion in modern history they've been influenced by things we've seen in the media and some changes can be dramatic, take for instance the classic [1940s and 50s more conservative look](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ab/5e/38/ab5e384c0aace2f7006f7021836791b7.jpg) then in less than a decade [you had people dressing like this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a9/71/5a/a9715a388b40681d9f481614b334b788.jpg) and [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/75/30/67/7530673bf69332094cea4afe453d3e1a.jpg) which I imagine if you went in a coma or something in 1950 and woke up in the Swinging Sixties you'd probably be baffled about how everyone got to this point.

But take 80s fashion for instance, it was heavily influenced by countless pop music icons creating different 'movements' like the New Romantics or TV shows like Dynasty really popularised the giant padded shoulders and poofy voluminous hair in womens fashion, Princess Diana influenced more 'elegant' more formal fashion, Miami Vice and action movies influenced the turtlenecks with blazers and the 'Don Johnson' baggy open shirts with rolled sleeves for young men etc. Everyone wanted to dress like the people they saw in the media and I can easily imagine the same thing happening in the 24th Century where a few well known trendsetters introduce a new fashion on Earth and across Federation planets entirely."

DaystromInstitute,fg43wtn,t3_ewp0jc,1580495631.0,"I agree that Starfleet Command probably attracts the wrong sorts of people, there are likely going to always be those very 'career driven' people who are usually intelligent, very conscientious and very driven to get to the top but probably not for the right reasons. Take Lieutenant Commander Shelby for instance who literally said to Riker *""You're in my way.""* because she seems to be striving to raise through the ranks of Starfleet as quick as she can to get to the good seat as it were, whereas when you have well known experienced and famous Captains, eg Kirk and Picard, who end up reaching the Admiralty they never seem very happy or motivated to be the 'desk Admiral' that has all the decision making power, leaving that sort of job open for a specific 'type' of person who enjoys giving orders and having power which as you say creates an opening for bad types of people with personal agendas and so on.

But when it comes to why Starfleet gets infiltrated to easily I actually think one of the main reasons other than those high positions attracting the wrong people is their lack of effective security which is touched on in DS9. The Federation and Starfleet are known as the 'good guys' and they take pride in the fact that they don't 'stoop' to the levels of their enemies and always try to 'play fair' as it were (which Dukat calls 'holier than thou Federation fair play dogma'). However they are also then shocked to realise that something like Section 31 exists behind the scenes to actually do the dirty work they're too 'civilised' to do, which is a bit naive but understandable I suppose given the 'paradise' and 'utopia' that the Federation is cracked up to be and so probably leads citizens to think the Federation *really* does survive and prosper thanks to handshakes, cuddles and rainbows.

I think it's this *""We're better than that, we hold true to our ideals and principles no matter what!""* mentality that is like a double edged sword, whilst it makes the Federation more morally good and 'righteous' it also gives the Federation/Starfleet a specific disadvantage when it comes to security both internal and external. As Odo mentions to Bashir when they first discuss Section 31: *""I can't believe the Federation condones this kind of activity!""* *""Personally, I find it hard to believe they wouldn't. Every other great power has a unit like Section thirty one. The Romulans have the Tal Shiar, the Cardassians had the Obsidian Order.""* - When everyone else is 'playing the game' of espionage with serious stuff like assassinations, infiltration, undercover ops, interrogations, kidnapping and so on but you're only playing the 'intelligence gathering' game, you automatically have a disadvantage against *any* kind of operations plotted against you and your organisation (Take the 'molecular reconstruction' bit the latest Picard episode when Picard touts that Romulan methods are both illegal and non-effective, to which Laris replies *Yeah, that's what we wanted you to think""*, there is clearly some Federation hubris that has generally blinded them from the seriousness of all the threats they've faced in the last 50 years). I think Sloans quote from ""Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges"" sums it up pretty well actually: *""The Federation needs men like you, doctor.

Someone has to protect men like you from a universe that doesn't share your sense of right and wrong.""* - When the Federation has dangerous mysterious enemies infiltrating the heart of Starfleet on Earth no less more often than you'd hope would ever happen, you know somethings seriously wrong with your own security and intelligence services. It also probably doesn't help with the sort of 'naive idealism' that some Starfleet officers have about the way the universe works because the price of peace is eternal vigilance. Now of course I'm not saying Section 31 are 'good guys' or anything but I'd say the 'dim' reality of it is they're the 'necessary evil' as it were, they or people like them are one of the reasons international *or* intergalactic powers stay 'afloat', they do the dirty work people don't want to see or know about whilst maintaining the illusion that everything remains a lovely and peaceful utopia simply because of 'democracy and freedom', which I think is kind of the disconnect we're seeing now between Picards idealism and modern Starfleets more pragmatic or realist approach."

What I found interesting about that bit was it basically describes Picards adherence and love of the Prime Directive through TNG, everytime he refused to interfere or chose to interfere he is deciding if a species lives or dies. Take TNG ""Homeward"" for instance when he chose to let the civilisation that Worfs brother, Nikolai, was studying to die because of the Prime Directive or TNG ""Pen Pals"" when he was going to let the Dremans die in fiery lava but in both occasions another person (Nikolai and Data) stepped forward and took the initiative to prevent it. Maybe we can say at least Picard has learnt from that mentality like the ['It's not theoretical, it's not hypothetical, it's real!' speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2U4pssEqHY) he gives to Rasmussen in ""A Matter of Time"" but it seems like Picard isn't the most self aware of people (The way he basically asked for a ship, a crew and 'offered' the Admiral the opportunity to demote him as if it wasn't already her choice struck me as pretty brazen) especially about his own actions."

brooklynninenine,ffpb0zn,t1_ffouz18,1580090585.0,"I think one of the biggest issues I've noticed with Gina is rather than just being an egotistical character that's meant to be arrogant and unlikeable for the most part, they often portray her as 'saving the day' or 'being right all along'. So when you make a realistically egotistical and arrogant character that is probably similar to someone we've met before in real life and proceed to write stories where they end up being the hero for no reason, which in turn just helps to inflate their ego even further which also perpetuates their dim view of the others who do actual work? It can just become insufferable for a lot of fans.

A few examples I can think of off the top of my head would be take 'The Last Ride' where all episode long Gina has been the most annoying person in existence with her 'Ginazon' instagram thing, pranking everyone by putting cement in their drinks like a child whilst making silly noises and ""You just drank ceeemmmeeennntttt!"" and so on (something you could realistically be arrested for, especially when doing to a bunch of police officers within a police station), then at the end of the episode her little 'Ginazon' thing is what 'saves' the precinct. Not all the crimes they solved or the good jobs the police characters have done, just Ginas accidental filming of Holts speech. Or another example is way back in Sal's Pizza where they try hire a IT expert and it turns out to be another 'Gina is right all along' conclusion or the whole 'Gina knows best' trope that comes back every so often. Don't get me wrong she has quite a few real funny moments on the show, one of my favourite scenes with her is [her pretending to be Italian and doesn't understand English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAnGY9gg20c) but I think they wrote her to be an oddly contradictory 'Mary Sue' of sorts. Generally the Mary Sue trope has a character whose 'perfect' and 'ideal' and can do just about everything but Gina is strange in that shes far from an ideal person in terms of personality but she still seems to be the one who 'saves the day' through 'street smarts' and so on, she also isn't exactly humble in 'victory' either so I imagine that contributes to why shes not that well liked by a reasonable majority of the fanbase but at the same time she's still an integral part of the crew I'd say."
DaystromInstitute,ffp7cvx,t1_ffm4fb6,1580088065.0,"> The Federation went out of its way to try and find the redeeming humanity (for lack of a better term) in the JemHadar

Technically that was just more Dr Bashir in *""Hippocratic Oath""* and Odo in *""The Abandoned""* than the Federation as a whole, they were quite specific and unique situations because Dr Bashir is a rather hopeful, if not naive, young man who always wants to try help people because thats his job and Goran'Agar was a very unique Jem'Hadar, an anomaly if you will as he didn't need the white to survive and so Bashir seeing hope in Goran'Agar made logical sense but it seems Bashir never discovered *why* Goran'Agar was so unique and as the other Jem'Hadar under Goran'Agar proved, he was the exception rather than the rule.

And when Odo tried to bring out the 'humanity' in the Jem'Hadar youth in ""The Abandoned"" it was more lead by a sense of guilt Odo had because he was a Changeling, his people were the ones who made the Jem'Hadar and programmed them to fight and die for them in their wars etc and at the end of the day he was unsuccessful in changing the nature of the Jem'Hadar youth.

So I wouldn't say the Federation 'went out of its way' to try make friends with the Jem'Hadar at all really because there wasn't actually a moment that the Federation was very pro-Jem'Hadar, they were the 'enemy' and in Siskos estimation to the Federation president himself *""The Jem'Hadar are the most brutal and efficient soldiers I've ever encountered. They don't care about the conventions of war or protecting civilians. They will not limit themselves to military targets. They'll be waging the kind of war that Earth hasn't seen since the founding of the Federation.""* - Doesn't sound like they're 'trying to find redeeming qualities' to me exactly because it's a nice thought that the Jem'Hadar were a redeemable people who were 'just following orders' but in reality they're programmed to be the way they were (The Scorpion and the Toad fable springs to mind) and even the most hopeful idealism wouldn't be enough to stop them from destroying you if you got in their way."

They certainly kept up the old Earth law about banning genetic engineering whilst other races such as the Denobulans had been using genetic engineering just fine for 'over two centuries' in the pre-Federation era, fast forward to 2373 in the episode *""Doctor Bashir, I Presume?""* even getting some genetic engineering done, let alone actually performing it, holds a two year sentence. Is it *really* that far fetched that after an attack that supposedly left 100,000 people dead and Mars some kind of smoldering ruin that the Federation leadership, who wasn't exactly a big fan of synthetic lifeforms to begin with (See ""The Measure of a Man"" and ""The Offspring""), would ban synthetic lifeform research just like genetic engineering? It really doesn't seem *that* shocking to me given the Federations history."
DaystromInstitute,ffp5fgm,t1_ffmnj3c,1580086698.0,"> The Federation is absolutely an allegory for the United States. On the surface, it’s Paradise. If you dig a little deeper, you find that it’s the same morally bankrupt, nightmare as anywhere else. The worst part is, for a brief time, it was everything that we dreamed it was...

DS9 actually has some great criticism of Starfleet and Federation ideals and its 'rainbows and unicorns utopia' from both and inside and outside perspective, take for instance Sisko's quote: *""Just because a group of people belongs to the Federation it does not mean that they are saints! Do you know what the trouble is? The trouble is Earth. On Earth there is no poverty, no crime, no war. You look out the window of Starfleet headquarters and you see paradise. Well, it's easy to be a saint in paradise, but the Maquis do not live in paradise. Out there in the Demilitarised zone, all the problems haven't been solved yet. Out there, there are no saints, just people. Angry, scared, determined people who are going to do whatever it takes to survive whether it meets with Federation approval or not""* and most of those 'Maquis' are Humans, 24th Century Humans just with different views, beliefs and in quite a different situation than life on Earth or in Starfleet, without the comfort of being able to cling to those 'ideals'.

But later on in the 'Home Front/Paradise Lost' two parter for instance we see that things *aren't even* as rosy back on Earth as Sisko might have been lead to believe. There is a false-flag sabotage incident on Earths power grid leading to emergency measures which Sisko comments on after he discovers the truth: *""With a Starfleet officer on every corner, paradise has never seemed so well-armed.""* and of course Admiral Leytons planning a military coup to take 'temporary' control of the government and overthrowing the Federation President as a result of a changeling bombing in Antwerp, which leads to a Changeling infiltration scare. Not the kinds of actions you'd expect from supposedly 'morally superior' and 'evolved' human beings to be doing in 'paradise' eh? [Quark actually has a good analysis of 24th Century Humans](https://youtu.be/-D2SHNqkjbY?t=88) from an outsider perspective: *""Let me tell you something about humans, nephew. They're a wonderful, friendly people as long as their bellies are full and their holosuites are working. But take away their creature comforts, deprive them of food, sleep, sonic showers, put their lives in jeopardy over an extended period of time, and those same friendly, intelligent, wonderful people...will become as nasty and as violent as the most bloodthirsty Klingon. You don't believe me? Look at those faces. Look in their eyes.""* - We haven't changed as much as we think we have, we may have become more technologically advanced and solved some problems that have been plaguing mankind for centuries (War, Poverty, Hunger etc) but we're still Humans and we still have the same tendencies and natures as we had before, just like how Vulcans have the veneer of civilisation with their adherence to 'logic and science' but underneath they still have their almost 'tribal' instincts and floods of emotions. I mean Picard himself isn't above being lead by emotions and fear and 'reverting' to his non-24th Century 'morally superior' self as we see in First Contact when his resentment for the Borg fuels his actions such as [Tommy Gunning the Borg and digging through the corpse](https://youtu.be/d7dfsLfWJvc?t=131) of what used to be his own crewman without remorse and getting obsessed with his vendetta against the Borg for what they did to him and so many others, so if Picard of all people can still act this way despite being a idealic 24th Century Starfleet Officer, it makes perfect sense that many, many other ordinary people throughout the Federation can drop their, to paraphrase Gul Dukat, *'holier-than-thou Federation fair-play dogma'* and revert back to the 'old ways' when faced with the dangerous and serious events the Federation has been through over the last 30-40 years in Trek."

DaystromInstitute,ffhf4uq,t1_ffeuimk,1579932639.0,"> They were manipulated by someone, like the Romulans or Lore.

This is my current theory until I see more, possibly even a Romulan-Federation conspiracy like Undiscovered Country which could benefit 'war hawks' types of both sides.

We see Romulans taking over the Borg Cube at the end with a rather Imperial eagle looking symbol above the hangerbay door and I'm wondering if they're gonna 'adopt' STO's sort of story with the Romulan Imperialist remnants wanting to restore the Romulan Empire (Would at least give an excuse for Denise Crosby to return as Sela for another main cast reunion) and the Romulan 'Republicans' who spread out in various colonies and into the Federation who were influenced more by the Romulan underground Spock was involved in. Given that the attack on Mars was the reason why the Federation retreated from the evacuation efforts and left the Romulans behind makes me wonder whether theres some anti-Federation Romulan faction that didn't want Federation help, they didn't want the Federation 'saving the day' and 'corrupting' their culture, sort of how we saw American culture affected and influenced countries post-WWII during occupations, military bases and with the Marshall Plan as it spread American influence, propaganda, culture and American interests to European nations and had reasonably large effects on their individual cultures and way of life from country to country.

So it's possible some rather xenophobic Romulan faction made up of old soldiers from the Neutral Zone cold war days didn't want Federation assistance because of the inevitable 'influence' in the Romulan way of life that would come with it, take for instance the quote from ""The Neutral Zone"" from Commander Tebok *""Your presence is not wanted. Do you understand my meaning, Captain? We are back.""* so if they knew that a major disaster near the heart of the Federation would cause them to become more isolationist and back away then they'd probably take that opportunity. But the reasoning for my thinking it might be a conspiracy is the news interviewer lady says *""Many felt there were better uses for our resources than helping the Federations oldest enemy.""* and *""Romulan lives.""* instead of saying 'lives' like Picard does, so its probable that amongst Starfleet most Admirals would be veterans of the old cold war days and would be very distrustful of helping the Romulans in the same way Admiral Cartwright and Kirk were initially vehemently against helping the Klingons, the old enemy, in a similar disaster scenario [*""They're animals! Don't believe them! Don't trust them! Let them die!""*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiH1Bk6WmvI) and how the Klingons themselves feared Federation intereference in their culture and way of life and 'insidious assimilation' like [the classic great scene between Garak and Quark.](https://youtu.be/6VhSm6G7cVk?t=93)

Picard may have caught wind of 'something is rotten in the state of denmark' within Starfleet and probably had a similar briefing/meeting that Kirk had in Undiscovered Country where Picard heard the more 'war hawk' types saying they should abandon the rescue attempts and refuse to help the Romulans or bring them into Federation territory en masse but this time maybe the majority of the Admirals agreed with the anti-Romulan types and Picard was enraged and dismayed that his fellow Admirals would turn a blind eye so quickly and so quit Starfleet, a rage we see part of during the interview. I mean to be fair Picard shouldn't be surprised, the Starfleet Prime Directive is essentially an interstellar *'I don't want to get my hands dirty and deal with the consequences so lets turn a blind eye to death and suffering when I choose to'* card that he himself has played a few times so that he didn't have to get involved in others affairs, so Starfleet turning its back honestly doesn't surprise me that much but obviously Picards views on the PD changed as he got older. (Granted the PD doesn't apply here but I'm more referring to the fact the Federation turns a blind eye when it suits itself, to quote Keeve Falor in 'Ensign Ro': *""And the Federation is pledged not to interfere in the internal affairs of others. How convenient that must be for you, to turn a deaf ear to those who suffer behind a line on a map.""*)"

DaystromInstitute,ffb5bm8,t3_esc2tm,1579752195.0,"This is what I've thought too, when we consider the technological advancements of the 24th Century with the harmless sonic showers to 'shake off the dirt' from your pours, Baryon sweeps to clean away radiation from starships or even decontamination biofilters built directly into the transporter to screen any viruses or particles may be beamed aboard, it seems baffling that they wouldn't have some form of automated cleaning of conduits, plasma ducts or even the big ol' Nacelle tubes as they all seem rather dangerous places to send people into with a 'handheld scrubber' and would be amazingly inefficient.

Generally when we think of Starfleet we think of their love of 'efficiency', they're always tinkering with things and trying to modify bits and bobs to 'increase efficiency by 10%' or make adjustments to try make things slightly easier or better in some fashion (O'Brien wanting to rebuild DS9's systems from the ground up but suggesting it'd take 2-3 years of work for instance) but to think they'd still have conduits that need scrubbing every so often with like a little Starfleet issue janitors jumpsuit and mop is pretty funny but it seems unlikely given how inefficient and badly designed that'd be. Now in **TNG ""Up The Long Ladder""** we hear Riker say *'That isn't necessary. The ship will clean itself.'* in reference to Brenna cleaning up the hay they brought abroad, presumably that means conduits and jefferies tubes and so on are also automatically cleaned through various energy sweeps or possibly even some harmless phaser that can just disintegrate tiny particles of dirt. There are more than likely some kind of handheld 'cleaner phasers' used to target specific things that can build up on surfaces like certain types of particles for instance, we actually see tools like this throughout Trek but a specific example I can think of is in **TNG ""The Next Phase""** when Data starts detecting chroniton fields from Geordi and Ro he uses an ['Anyon emitter'](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/memoryalpha/images/0/06/Anyon_emitter.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100817152308&path-prefix=en) that, not surprisingly, emits Anyon particles to counteract this *(Sort of like the [Polaron emitter 'grenades'](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/memoryalpha/images/6/6e/Polaron_emitter.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20060329165118&path-prefix=en) we see in* **DS9 ""Apocalypse Rising""** *to revert Changelings forms)*. 

Toward the end of the episode Data orders that the entirety of Ten Forward be decontaminated with a flood of Anyon particles, physically we don't actually see any kind of emitter beam pass through Picard or Data nor any sign that anythings actually being decontaminated [beyond Ro and Geordi sparkling like a nebula](http://tng.trekcore.com/hd/albums/season-5/5x24/the-next-phase-hd-433.jpg) whilst being out of phase, so I would imagine rooms aboard Starfleet ships have some form of decontamination emitters that can be innocuous and unintrusive and essentially can clean rooms, corridors and conduits without any kind of scrubbing, washing, scraping, sponging or swabbing. That might explain why the carpeted floors and furniture always look so clean without any 24th Century equivalents of roombas or janitors, especially since if those roombas accidentally became mildly sentient through some AI malfunction you'd probably get Picard or Data leaping to their defence as a new lifeform who can't be 'exploited as cleaners' anymore."
