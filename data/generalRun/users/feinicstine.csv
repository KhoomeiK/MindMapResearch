aww,ffcy6p9,t1_ffcxtyu,1579809708.0,Interesting. My baby always moved way too much for even that to have worked. The wearable blankets were a lifesaver for us so she wasn't constantly kicking them off and getting cold.  Even now at almost 2 we put the blanket and pillow in there with her and she falls asleep uncovered with her feet on the pillow.
aww,ffcx8vq,t1_ffcur6n,1579809168.0,"I'm in the US. Guidelines here are nothing in the crib until 18mo. We just put our babies in footie pjs and wearable sleepsacks.  I wasn't aware that any country was recommending blankets anymore. How do they suggest you constantly monitor them to keep the blankets off their faces?

Also, I know you're being hyperbolic but 25C is way too hot. AAP recommendations are closer to 20C. They overheat easily."
aww,ffcszat,t1_ffcqr7u,1579806635.0,Not a bit. Babies shouldn't have anything in their crib with them. They can't move well enough to free themselves if they get tangled in it or it gets pulled over their head and smothers them.

The thing is that he's been made aware and where you would have changed, he's assuming he can't possibly be the problem. It's a frustrating display of willful disregard. I would be as angry as you."

A lot of people, me included, dislike or get headaches from the smell. I'll admit I know nothing about smoking but it sounds like there are options to reduce the stink.

When I told my manager at my old job he was super excited and talked to me about it all a ton but there were other people there (men especially) who didn't even seem to know if they should acknowledge it.  I think they're terrified of putting their foot in their mouth.

My favorite part was all the men who had multiple kids would go out of their way to gently inform me when there was food left over from meetings. It made me laugh every time."

breakingmom,ff69iqz,t1_ff66mf4,1579622288.0,"I was coming here to say this. It's not the dirt really that makes your house look messy (unless you have dust bunny tumbleweeds or something) it's the STUFF. We don't buy or keep a lot. We each have our thing we probably go overboard on, his is hobbies, mine is kitchen appliances but that stuff has its storage spot in the basement. Kids toys are tucked away in storage solutions but easily accessible. And we don't leave things out. We pick up daily.

Not only does it make it look cleaner if you don't have stuff everywhere, but it's easier to actually clean. We did it yesterday while I was off work and it probably took an hour and a half for us to scrub, dust, vacuum and mop. Doing it alone takes closer to 2 hours."

Of course a guy in his 20s is going to consider himself the equal of a woman in her 40s. It's on her as the older member of the relationship and the established personality in their field to enforce even unspoken boundaries and recognize that they are not equals. She is in a position of power here. Even thinking nothing of the sort will happen she needs to acknowledge the long term professional implications to both of their art careers should things be discovered or go south. She shouldn't have even crossed in to texting, it's too convenient and informal of a medium.

The way they're talking to each other is inappropriate. You don't have deep philosophical discussions that give you and opportunity to say you're falling in love with someone unless you really want to say it to them. There really isn't an innocent way to start that conversation.  They're crossing lines and are both going to get burned."

He needs therapy and its non negotiable. He likely also needs medication if only to get over that first hump of anxiety attacks.  My husband had to take his treatment in to his own hands. There's no way you can fix this for him. Does he understand how much it's affecting his family?  It's going to take a lot of grace and patience on your part during his treatment but the first step is to be brutally honest. I know your instinct is not to upset him and shield him but that has to stop. You cannot be the cure for him.  My husband came to the realization that he needed to see a professional on his own but it was definitely after I cried more than a few times because I couldn't handle having to leave events or not do things anymore because of his anxiety.  That was about 5 years ago now and he's a totally different person. There is hope."

breakingmom,felrxj4,t3_epu4uc,1579229443.0,"I did.  I did not enjoy the newborn phase. I cried every day for the first 3 or 4 months of her life. My husband is a SAHD and I don't know how he did it in the beginning. But she's 20 months now and so fun. She talks. She plays. She hugs and kisses us. I realized on my drive home today that I was excited to see her and I don't know when that happened because I remember crying in my way home at 4 months because I knew it would be another day of doing all the night wakes to bf and then pumping in the office.

Ask for help. I didn't. I did almost every wake up for her first year so I could bf and I reasoned that it was better for me to be the tired one because my coworkers would shake me awake. I'd never do that again.  Sleep is so important. So is getting some time to yourself even if it's just a shower and a nap.

It will get better. You're deep in the shit right now. It doesn't last forever but it lasts longer than you think you can survive. You can do this. This is the worst part."

I can't stand the smell and people are going to lose their minds over it for a while so I'll have to deal with it.  Maybe the legal blends smell better but every time I've smelled it in the past it makes me nauseous and gives me a headache to the point where I've never even been tempted to try it.  I don't want to smell that all the time. It's just as offensive as cigarette smoke imo.

It seemed almost like she stopped realizing she had another choice until their marriage became truly unbearable (cheating, alcoholism, financial abuse, fortunately no kids).

I hope you get some clarity through counseling.  If possible, maybe you could do some individual sessions as well to talk through with an objective third party?  You sound heartbreakingly unhappy and he seems completely indifferent to that."

There's something here I can't put my finger on. I'm getting the impression that you're really young or at least a lot younger than him and he's been the driving force in the relationship for a long time and just doesn't want you to rock the boat.

Either way, I think it's clear from your post that you both might be done and that's ok. If you're both willing to do counseling it's not a bad idea, but be honest with yourselves. Are you doing counseling to fix your marriage or for someone to give you permission to end it and help you through that?  You both just seem checked out from what you've written."

My husband stopped working and stays at home with our daughter but we put her in daycare 2 days a week once she was a year old. Her getting sick now is the plan.

My daughter is 20 months and already getting far more efficient at fighting off colds. I'm thrilled about it.

She probably knows that being upset over a tattoo doesn't make sense, but she can't help it. She's looking to her husband for reassurance that he still finds her attractive during a time in her life when she feels the least attractive and most vulnerable.  The tattoo is just the thing that she's fixated on that is facilitating these conversations.  It will most likely ease off after the pregnancy and hormones clear and it'll be something to laugh about. Being a jerk to her about her temporary discomfort will turn a funny story about pregnancy in to an ongoing issue in the relationship."

It's an easy time to feel really down on yourself.

OP, keep on being as understanding as you are. Focus on prepping for the baby and talk about how excited you are. As a pregnant woman, you know you're not going through this for nothing but before that baby gets there it's really easy to feel like you're ruining yourself with no end in sight."

He cleans the house, does yardwork and grocery shops. We split cooking duties and bedtime routine. I feel like I never get a break and it makes me bitter af some days but I also know he's working his butt off and if she's in school and he has some down time that's totally fair.  I haven't vacuumed in 2 years. I scrub the bathrooms some weeks and that's my housekeeping now.

If your husband is truly just putting your daughter in front of a screen while he sits in front of another one, he is doing NOTHING. And it's going to get worse when he has another kid to add on as an additional excuse. Maybe he's depressed. He needs therapy if he is. But you are 100% justified in your frustration and annoyance. Your daughter would be better off in full time daycare than sitting there watching endless movies.  It's not fair to her. She's the kid you guys had together.

Cooking,fcskjjo,t3_eim27z,1577918437.0,"I did and it failed hard. My brown rice stayed crunchy and it was sad. I think I had the heat too high or something... I don't know. Anyone have any insight in to what makes brown rice impervious to water?  I kept it covered and simmering in a cast iron skillet for 45 min in plenty of broth. My only thought is that the fats from the bacon and butter were too hot and laminated it or something when I added it to the onion, garlic and bacon.

At least I technically made it in 2019 so I haven't screwed anything up yet this year (and we had leftover lasagna that was good)."
breakingmom,fcp0vjb,t1_fcouc8v,1577847060.0,"Don't assume you'll have to!  The drugs that are safe during pregnancy and during breastfeeding aren't necessarily the same. You and your doctor can work out the best, safest plan for you and your baby.  If you do end up giving up breastfeeding for your mental health, no one with half a brain will ever call it the wrong choice. Your baby is better off with a healthy mom and formula is by no means bad for a kid.  I know that's hard to see now but I'm only 20 months out and people (including doctors) have already stopped asking if my daughter was breast or formula fed."
breakingmom,fcou2fe,t3_eibwqm,1577841570.0,Could you go see your regular doctor prior to getting in to therapy. They can prescribe you medication that may take the edge off until you find someone to talk to. I'm proud of you for realizing this isn't normal and getting yourself help. You're doing a great job.

You made it through the night and she's safe now even if she is crying. You're doing absolutely everything right, you just happen to be in the hardest part possible. You're doing great."
breakingmom,fcmwi53,t1_fcmvpfx,1577795445.0,I'm proud of you. I waited way too long and let it turn in to severe anxiety and some depression. I sincerely believe a therapist within 6 months should be part of the standard after birth plan.

witcher,fclg181,t1_fclec5a,1577746937.0,I'm honestly surprised it's that high based on the experience of most women I know!  And your last line is hilarious. You'd be sadly surprised by how many people will invite themselves in to your reproductive life when you're a woman of childbearing age.

I swear, general knowledge of how anything in our bodies works is so abysmal but pregnancy in particular seems to be a complete mystery to so many people. We are literally all here because of it. You'd think there would be a better understanding that it happens differently for everyone. Some people never puke, some can't keep food down until delivery.  Sigh."

Pavetta had just expended a massive amount of magical energy for the first time in her life and vomited and everyone jumped to pregnant. It's so true to life. From the age of about 17 to idk, 50 maybe, every time a woman doesn't feel well someone jumps to ""HaVe YoU tAkEn A pReGnAnCy TeSt?¿?"" I'm 34 and it hasn't stopped yet.

When I was pregnant, I never had a second of morning sickness or food aversion. But my IUD having self gets the flu and people are telling me to buy pregnancy tests.  Poor Pavetta.  It even happens in Cintra."

She's going to scream mama and charge you when you walk in the door. It's hard to know they're growing but the love they become capable of showing is incredible.
