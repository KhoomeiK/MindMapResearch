I clarified in another comment though that I’m not trying to armchair diagnose (even though it does come across that way). I’m just extremely familiar with those particular thought patterns as someone with depression myself. That’s why I recommended talking to a trained therapist in person rather than an online counsellor. They can make a diagnosis, if needed, and even if it’s not full-blown anxiety or depression they can help OP find coping strategies."
tifu,fevweed,t1_fev92d9,1579402280.0,"Doesn't matter how privileged your life is. Depression can kick in regardless of circumstance, because it's more a chemical imbalance or response to stress (yes, even stresses like diploma exams or home situation). There's no cosmic scale out there saying ""you must suffer x amount to be worthy of depression."" It's a very individual thing, y'know?

I'll also point out that it's more than just feeling sad/having trouble feeling happy. It can also be trouble caring about things in your life, feeling like you're constantly covered in a wet grey blanket, self-hatred, or being unable to feel anything 90% of the time. Oh, and executive dysfunction—knowing that you need to do something, knowing that it's not even really that hard, but being totally unable to do it for no apparent reason.

Anyway. I'm not trying to armchair diagnose you (really). I just recognized those thought patterns because I spent well over a decade dealing with them too, so I wanted to reach out. It's worth noting that my life is pretty damn privileged too, but brains are just assholes sometimes."

An online counsellor can be good, but I'd really recommend seeing a trained professional in person, possibly even sooner than 2 weeks. I know it's terrifying, and it can feel like admitting that something is really Wrong. I promise it's worth it, though. You don't have to live with that fog hanging over everything or that nagging voice saying ""I'm not good enough, I'm not worth it, I'm a failure."" 

Also, guess what: you are deserving of help. People see therapists for all kinds of reasons, ranging from ""I need help with a decision"" to ""I just need to check in and make sure everything's normal"" to ""I've gone through a major trauma."" And they're all valid reasons.

All that said, I'm glad you're seeing this as a wake-up call. Yes, it came from something you shouldn't have done, but if that's the kick you need to start taking care of yourself, so be it."
