It doesn’t apply to fat people who do all those same things and still remain fat! Cause that’s the thing: the physical laws of the universe are different for different people, which is why thin people are thin and fat people are fat. 👍🏻"

fatlogic,fdkpsod,t3_eluhvm,1578508624.0,"I’m so confused by these people’s idiotic, contradictory pseudoscience. They are always saying that losing weight requires restrictive (disordered according to them) eating. So, if people only lose weight through restriction, which is true, then how can you turn around and claim that weighing more has nothing to do with eating more? Those two things are mutually exclusive. If calorie intake has no effect on weight, then restriction should not result in weight loss. 

I’d like to ask them, what happens when anorexic people do not eat at all? They become emaciated and lose weight rapidly, right? Yes? Ok, then how can you claim that the opposite, eating lots and lots of calories, does not result in weight gain? 

STOP THE LIES. If you want to be taken seriously and gain traction as a social justice movement, stop lying to yourself about the FACTS. Accept the objective truth and build your movement around those facts. You can still fight for fat peoples rights, health and happiness without lying."

I’ve told him that there’s no faster way to get me dryer than the Sahara than to make stupid jokes and dry jump me, or smile creepily while wiggling his eyebrows... he does this mock passion thing where he’ll jokingly/mockingly simulate extreme passion but as a joke? Like, grabbing me all over while moaning loudly and kissing my neck and humping me... ugh. He’s gotten better about it but I really don’t like it ever, but especially if he’s actually expecting to have sex. That’s the worst, when he thinks I’m going to respond sexually or become aroused. It makes me feel like he thinks sex is just a joke, and for me, nothing is less sexy than joking around. 

He’s getting better about it. I don’t think he means to humiliate me but that’s how I feel when he does this. Humiliated. Like he can’t manage genuine passion for me so he fakes it. I dunno"

sex,fdeci2t,t3_ekokaa,1578336024.0,"I cringed so hard at him sending you that article... at this point in your relationship, with a kid on the way, you should be able to talk about these things. Seriously, sex talk should be a breeze at this point. 

Like “honey, I’d like it if you could try doing this or that in the sack?” Or “babe, if you could work on your appearance and hygiene, it would help me get turned on and want to please you in bed. I love you the way you are, obviously, but a little effort can go a long way for me”

When it comes to his personal habits (haircuts, tooth brushing, deodorant, dressing nicer, clean and trimmed nails, shaving, etc) that’s a tough thing to change. Especially if he’s had these habits a long time. It’s not as easy as just asking someone to do better when it comes to personal care habits. It takes a long time and dedication for that stuff to become second nature. Good luck."

Atrophy can lead to “disappeared clitoris”, where the tissue literally shrivels up, dries out, and disappears. The trick is regular blood flow to the area. Tumescence. I’m not saying she’s definitely at risk for this or has clitoral atrophy. That would require a dr diagnosis.

sex,fctk5le,t3_einthp,1577946178.0,"This has happened to me maybe five times in my three year relationship. 3 times I asked to stop because I felt off and wasn’t enjoying myself. All three times, my bf did not try to conceal his anger and hurt. The other couple times, we had to stop because he couldn’t cum, and I was disappointed and felt insecure, but I reassured him and told him it was no big deal.

I really believe that men tend to take this kind of thing more personally, as some kind of affront to their prowess and performance, leading to anger, whereas most women are socialized to coddle their partners ego, to nurture and show compassion. So when a woman needs to stop, the man can get bent out of shape thinking it’s a judgment on him and take it out on her, whereas if a man needs to stop, the woman feels the need to shove down her disappointment or insecurity and coddle him: “it’s ok baby, it happens to all guys sometimes” lol. It’s the classic thing where men externalize their anger and women internalize. Generalizing, I know, but I think there’s a grain of truth there. Neither are healthy ways to handle something that isn’t such a big deal."

fatlogic,fctbtji,t1_fctavg7,1577938398.0,"That’s true. And that’s what I love about science. Scientists are always challenging each other’s conclusions and findings, and when the preponderance of evidence is strong enough, theories are overthrown in favor of better ones. But it’s a fallacy to always claim that we just can’t know or believe anything, or that all theories are equal.

Trust me, when a preponderance of compelling evidence comes along concluding that what we do and eat has no bearing on weight, and that what we weigh has no bearing on our health, I’ll be the first to say, “guess I was wrong.” Lol

I’ll just assume that the scientists are right about evolution, germ theory, the theory of relativity, etc, because it makes the most sense to do so, and any “evidence” to the contrary is highly suspect and regarded with disdain by the community. I guess what I’m saying is that for now, it’s the best we’ve got."
fatlogic,fctahj7,t1_fct5x30,1577937290.0,"True. it’s just this trend of denying and misrepresenting well established scientific fact and historical fact, because it clashes with your worldview or sense of self.

It’s possible his libido has dropped. It’s also possible it’s always been low, or lower than yours, and he was able to keep up with you at first due to it being the honeymoon phase of your relationship, and/or because he could keep up for a certain amount of time but is tired of the effort now, and his security in the relationship is allowing him to feel safe to stop trying.

Not everyone has a high libido. It’s natural and not necessarily a handicap for him to require less sex than you. If your libidos are mismatched, it’s up to the both of you to decide if you can stay together and deal. If he feels unhappy with low libido, he should see a doctor. 

Neither of you should pass judgment on the other for your libidos. He shouldn’t shame you for using toys and masturbating and wanting him, and you shouldn’t judge him for not doing the same. You’re in a tough spot but you’re a team and should address this as a team and support each other through it."

We get the idea that we aren’t tight enough, that we aren’t exciting enough, that something about our bodies isn’t doing it for him...

Fat acceptance is like anti vaxxers, creationists, flat earthers, etc. They don’t understand or respect the science and believe that misrepresenting, denying, or remaining ignorant of it is the only way to protect their worldview. It’s sad and it’s not true.

If you exercise more, eat healthier foods, cook more instead of going out, limit your intake of junk foods and processed foods, and increase your consumption of fruits and veggies and real foods, it is a guarantee that you’ll lose weight. Even if you did all those things without any attention to calories, you would most likely end up eating less calories, burning more, and losing some amount of weight.

DeadBedrooms,fca7ooq,t3_egltnk,1577564299.0,"It’s a red flag. When you ask a question like this and don’t get a “no”,but instead are met with another question, it’s a sign of lying. When I caught my ex lying about cheating, he did the same thing. It went like this: 

Me: “were you actually at your parents house all day?”

Him: “Where else would I have been?”

Me: “I don’t know. But were you actually there?”

Him: “where do you think I was?”

Me: “I don’t know. We’re you at your parents all afternoon or not?”

Him: “I don’t even have a car. Where would I go?”

It went on like this. I had been watching many videos and researching how to spot deception. I was practically begging him to answer definitively with “yes”, but he never did. I later saw in his Uber history that he had not been with his parents at all. He’d been lying. And I knew from the way he answered. 

I’m not saying he’s definitely lying. I am saying that it’s always useful to know the signs of deception and this is a big one. It’s a sign to stay vigilant. When an innocent person is asked something incriminating, they will respond definitively and with indignation.

Another one I noticed a lot with my ex was over explaining. When he wanted me to believe he was doing one thing when he was really doing another, he would explain what he was doin  in great detail. Otherwise I got the bare minimum and he wasn’t very talkative,m. When he lied, he told me all kinds of irrelevant and trivial details."
DeadBedrooms,fca33nh,t3_egoias,1577562376.0,"Omfg I was considering writing a post about this. In the beginning, we would start by kissing and fondling and getting hot and heavy. 

Now, he says “take your pants off” or “let’s get naked”( looking at me like a doof and wiggling his eyebrows, smiling) or “want to touch my penis? Want me to touch your vagina?” Like... ew. Seriously? It’s like he sees sex with me as a literal joke and it turns me off so so much. Once we get into it all that juvenile jokey crap stops. It’s like he’s forgotten how to turn me on... or he’s not turned on by me anymore and actually fucking me is the only way he can get aroused. Like, we used to have sex because we were horny. Now we get horny by having sex. Better than not fucking at all and every so often the sex will turn into something great... but I miss how it used to be. I HATE the jokey jokey, I’m a 12 year old boy who says “boobies” initiating. 

The worst part is, I told him flat out the joking about sex is a turn off and a great way to dry out my pussy instantly, but he keeps doing it. All the time. 

I don’t have solutions for you. I’m just ranting. I almost want to be like, watch a love scene in a movie. Does the guy turn to the girl and say “wanna touch my penis” and wiggle his eyebrows at her”? No? Then why don’t you follow his lead and act like sex with me isn’t a huge joke."
sex,fc99aib,t1_fc98hdg,1577549104.0,"Yes! I think masturbation is so important. I was sort of accidentally celibate from age 22-26 (after getting clean and sober, coincided with depression, isolation, and rapid weight gain) and during that time I barely masturbated. After meeting my boyfriend and resuming a sex life, I started masturbating again almost spontaneously. I’m sure it would also work the other way around. It’s not just about agreeing to sex when your partner asks, it’s about incorporating sex and sexual thought into your life, and masturbation is so important to developing sexual fantasy and expression. Women need to embrace masturbation.

I think loss of female libido is a big one. It can happen to men too, but it seems to be a bigger issue with women for some reason, and it is the overarching sexual complaint that women have. Who knows what causes it: age, weight gain/unhealthy lifestyle, medications, menopause, hormonal changes... Its really shitty when you realize you just aren’t as sexual as you want to be and there’s no easy answer. Women have been waiting for an answer to this problem for a long time, and researchers have been working on “the female viagara”."

No, not treating myself like shit and feeling the physical and psychological results of self love in action makes me happy. I may never be as thin as I was in high school, but I’ll never be obese again. I show myself love by putting effort in every day. 

Self love without action is meaningless. You can not love yourself while simultaneously committing an assault on your body, slowly killing it with poisonous eating habits and a sedentary lifestyle. 

These people really need to stop conflating self love and complacency."
