pcgaming,ffq72dn,t1_ffq24v4,1580123957.0,"You just gotta learn to say no.  There isn’t much you can do if they refuse to seek professional help.  You can only encourage someone so much, but they have to convince themselves they want to change.  I don’t have an answer on how to encourage this person in a meaningful way without providing a blanket answer.  Everyone responds differently to different suggestions.

If they ever make to what you perceive is a literal threat on their own or someone else’s life, you have exactly one option.  Tell the person you have get their local police to intervene.  This will either have them reevaluate their stance, or get them hospitalized where they can start professional counseling (a sizable hospital bill in the US too).  Won’t always be a wake up call for them though.  If they drink, refuse to ever do anything with the person when they are drinking.  Their drinking hurts you blah blah, and you don’t want to enable their self-destructive behaviors.  If they are in crisis while drunk, again, just call the police if you think it is vital for safety.  

Be honest with the person with how you feel.  If they feel like a burden, tell them you don’t want that responsibility as you have your on life to worry about.  Best you can do is be firm but positive.  You don’t have to abandon the person, but you don’t have to participate in their episodes.

Spent a little over a decade serving in the armed forces, and I’m actually surprised at how many people I knew well or somewhat well that took their own lives.  You work with and meet a ton of people in maintenance to the point when I broke 1k friends on FB way back when, I finally realized how stupid it was (probably a security issue too as it is just a way to ID a military network of personnel).  9 in total.  Of them all, only one of them people could see coming, but that person had the worst two years I’ve ever seen anyone have (drinking exacerbated everything tenfold).  The people who were vocal about it got the professional counseling that potential stopped them from taking their own life.

I hope your friend has a revelation, and is able to change for the better.  It is not easy to watch someone spiral away while you have to keep climbing higher in life.  The sad truth is one day you’ll climb so high that you just won’t fucking care anymore, and then the person will actually be alone."
