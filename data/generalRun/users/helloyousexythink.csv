Yes one meal of one cheeseburger costs less than a bag of carrots, but buying ingredients to cook 10 meals costs at least half what 10 meals at macdonalds would cost. As for food deserts, you cant tell me they dont have canned or frozen veg which is just as nutritionally viable."

You object to allowing police to solve rapes muders and grand theft, you are the problem and i always suspect you are planning something illegal at some point or you are a psychotic conspiracy theorist...because wtf would you care, oh no! I cant drive illegally anymore! Oh no i cant rob that store! Oh no i cant . You think its so bad, go out and get stabbed, then when the police cant find them because they arent recognizable then maybe youll change your mind. You think you are fighting for freedom...like our world wasnt a brutal terrifying mess our ancestors worked really fucking hard to clean up. Remember that when you get medical care. You say i want freedom? We have it. I can weite this and not be persecuted. Theres a huge siffrence between chinas communist dictatorship, and london police wanting to solve crimes.

No more white or cane sugar, except for a treat. No more alcohol, no hard drugs. If you want to do something and it's legal to or if it's not you probably should anyway, smoke some weed, and just try to remember and remind yourself not to overeat. No more ordering out food. hearty grains more often, brown rice( brown rice pasta is really tasty) and only occasional breads it has to be organic!!
Lots of skin on fish, kippers are good, avoid added salt. Sushi is great as long as you haven't eaten too many other carbs that day.
Use all natural soap and shampoo shower daily shampoo less often.
Go to the gym, if you sit at work get a balance pad and take walks. Run outside. Go hiking biking running swimming in the summer.
Stay warm in the winter so you dont try to eat to keep warm.
Exercise at home, if you have a Wii Fit or VR or anything take full advantage of it. Eat real healthy fresh organic food take your multivitamins in your vitamin C drink water and tea as your only drinks as long as you do this and you don't have a decent makeup routine and work hard everyday and get up and straighten your hair and curl it or make it look nice or whatever it is you want to do, even if you just want to throw it up in a messy bun, what really matters and the real truth of it is a beauty comes from the inside out. I don't wear makeup and I put my hair up in a bun all the time, and I get these comments and these looks I'm not trying to be sexy but I work really hard to maintain my health. I actually have quite a few health problems but this is the thing that gives me the advantage over everyone else.... Taking extremely good care of my body.
 the only thing I do in my beauty routine is I use at oatmeal face mask every once in awhile, I use those good organic soaps on my skin and I wash my face everyday and my browser good. And I honestly don't believe that there's any woman alive that wouldn't look stunningly gorgeous if they just followed the steps. It has nothing to do with genetics it has nothing to do with anything other than how healthy you are. Because every different person is attracted to everything different you can't say that two different girls are less attracted to each other because one has a bigger nose than the other. In fact I say this because I have a huge Italian nose.
They're all of these things about myself that I wish I could change that I don't think you're very beautiful, but nobody seems to notice. I used to be extremely overweight and I was not looked at in the same way, I used to be looked at with disgust, I've literally been walking with my boyfriend, and had people tell me a fat piggy. I grew up being bullied horrifically for my weight and my looks. I took my life into my own hands. I was sick the way people looked at me, and now I'm sick again of the way people looked at me. Honestly any day I'd rather pick people stare at me the way they do rather than the way they used to, but it definitely isn't fun either way. I guess what I'm saying is that it's a struggle for everybody no matter what goes on, but if you want to get the attention that I do now, that's how you do it."

television,feqo0wn,t3_eq0osp,1579344147.0,"I think the big thing about Gwyneth Paltrow, is, is she doesn't know what she's talking about. Naturally derived products not only make up the majority of our modern medicines that you get and receive in the hospital, but they also are useful. The only problem with homeopathic medicine / natural medicine is the fact that it doesn't work on everyone. And it's not strong enough to have an effect that's noticeable. Our ancestors figured out the majority of natural methods, and certain things do work. But that's why there are companies that are making legitimate Natural Health Products that actually do what is advertised because they're using scientific method to figure it out. Gwyneth Paltrow I think in her mind, is trying to do good. Unfortunately that's the most dangerous type of person because you can't show them why they're wrong. I don't think personally, that she's peddling snake oil as you all say. Because I'm sure some of those products like the ones with collagen, or certain Berry extractives, might actually help help you. It might not have the desired effect and it won't have a very strong effect, but who knows it might actually be helping people. I think that as long as it's not dangerous that anyone is free to try anything to try and benefit their life or their health or their body.  I think that before we all jump on her for pedaling snake-oil like she's some evil Hollywood bitch, we should think about the fact that this might just be a whole group of women that haven't gotten help they need psychologically. frankly in a country that charges ridiculous amounts of money for basic health care services, and health care services include Mental Health Care Services, you can just go to a psychologist for free. I get that some of the stuff is extremely insane and I think that nobody should sell, however that being said, no one should be criticized for trying anything to improve themselves . even though all of the claims are not true and it is dangerous to spread knowledge that isn't right, as long as she's not telling people to take arsenic pills, and giving people cancer like all of the other companies that we trust in that we're not name-calling right now, i think she and her Cult of crazy women can do whatever the f*** they want to. As long as she's not promoting anti-vax then I'm okay with whatever. I don't think anybody has a right to criticize her I think you should just let the women who have nothing else who feel like they need a hand to hold just hold that hand. Are you all going to start busting into churches and telling people that they have no knowledge and no proof and they don't know what's going on ? Goop is basically a cult religion yes but as long as they're not forcing anybody to drink poison and nobody's dying I really don't see a problem with her. At least she's not using sweatshops"

television,feqo0wn,t3_eq0osp,1579344147.0,"I think the big thing about Gwyneth Paltrow, is, is she doesn't know what she's talking about. Naturally derived products not only make up the majority of our modern medicines that you get and receive in the hospital, but they also are useful. The only problem with homeopathic medicine / natural medicine is the fact that it doesn't work on everyone. And it's not strong enough to have an effect that's noticeable. Our ancestors figured out the majority of natural methods, and certain things do work. But that's why there are companies that are making legitimate Natural Health Products that actually do what is advertised because they're using scientific method to figure it out. Gwyneth Paltrow I think in her mind, is trying to do good. Unfortunately that's the most dangerous type of person because you can't show them why they're wrong. I don't think personally, that she's peddling snake oil as you all say. Because I'm sure some of those products like the ones with collagen, or certain Berry extractives, might actually help help you. It might not have the desired effect and it won't have a very strong effect, but who knows it might actually be helping people. I think that as long as it's not dangerous that anyone is free to try anything to try and benefit their life or their health or their body.  I think that before we all jump on her for pedaling snake-oil like she's some evil Hollywood bitch, we should think about the fact that this might just be a whole group of women that haven't gotten help they need psychologically. frankly in a country that charges ridiculous amounts of money for basic health care services, and health care services include Mental Health Care Services, you can just go to a psychologist for free. I get that some of the stuff is extremely insane and I think that nobody should sell, however that being said, no one should be criticized for trying anything to improve themselves . even though all of the claims are not true and it is dangerous to spread knowledge that isn't right, as long as she's not telling people to take arsenic pills, and giving people cancer like all of the other companies that we trust in that we're not name-calling right now, i think she and her Cult of crazy women can do whatever the f*** they want to. As long as she's not promoting anti-vax then I'm okay with whatever. I don't think anybody has a right to criticize her I think you should just let the women who have nothing else who feel like they need a hand to hold just hold that hand. Are you all going to start busting into churches and telling people that they have no knowledge and no proof and they don't know what's going on ? Goop is basically a cult religion yes but as long as they're not forcing anybody to drink poison and nobody's dying I really don't see a problem with her. At least she's not using sweatshops"

The worst was my hometown history. Gave me horrific nightmares. 
So here it is..
I live in Halifax, NS, and we had the largest man made explosion prior to the atomic bomb happen here.. The Halifax Explosion.
There were heritage commecials on tv, which were about this train conductor saving a bunch of people. Cool. We send a giant Christmas Tree to Boston every year by train because the next day there was a blizzard and everyone almost died. they sent emergency care and saved basically the whole city. Very cool.
Whats not cool is, 
In elementary school we got to read real life accounts...stuff like the girl my fucking age walking...and then all.of a sudden thee was a flash, everything decimated, screaming bleeding torn apart people everywhere and this girl had a headache..moral was her eye fucking poped out from the force and she was in shock. My great aunt was in it and told me she was making breakfast or something and her back was to a window and her back was filled with broken glas shards and burnt horribly.
It was a fun topic to discuss. 
Also the titanic is a big thing because people lost to that tragedy were buried here.
All so fucking proud of our history.
Jesus, everyone died and it was horrific..

I dont have to wear make up because my skin looks good because its healthy. My eyes are bright because i eat my fruits and veggies, and real ass homemade food, organic goodness, lots of walking and easy exercise like cleaning my home and having hobbies and walking to the store etc. Veggies are cheaper than chips and im sick of hearing otherwise. Most women have the potential to be a 8 or above they just need to change their lifestyles.. its their choice everyday, whether they realize or not, that they can be that person everyone secretly wants to be but they dont do it. Healthy diet, excercise when you can, dont eat if you dont burn the calories..go to the dentist. 

 For both men and women... Thats literally the only things people are attracted to, soft glowing clear skin, rosy cheeks/ good complexion, bright colourful deep eyes, soft lips, tight stomach/ abs, good muscle tone, tight jawline, white straight teeth. For sexual features its a matter of preference and now things like boob size are not as important. All.of this is achieved from effort if you dont come by it naturally. 
EXCESSIVE make up is for teenagers and lazy girls."
