I personally am just really disappointed with how he carried his protest out, it could’ve been something good but his poor execution really scuffed it."

There were many options he had, and he just chose the wrong one."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff4ijfp,t3_erlcv8,1579564449.0,Honestly I’d probably be more supportive of crapernick if he wasn’t a 49er. What he did was dumb but he got way worse than he deserved
