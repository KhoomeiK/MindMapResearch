It's hard to not try and lift more than you should, specially if you have lifted in the past, but the risk of injury and being in a lot of pain for a few days is not worth it.



I got back into it a fee weeks ago, after years of not lifting, started very light and doing a 5x5 program. It's encouraging being able to consistently increase the weight every week.


It's all about keeping your ego in check, see a fit girl deadlifting double what you are? Good for her and no worries, I'll get there soon."
