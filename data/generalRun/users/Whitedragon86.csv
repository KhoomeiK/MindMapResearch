AskReddit,fg44po5,t3_ewlx4w,1580496110.0,"Mine was getting into a healthy relationship for the first time. He was pretty much perfect in every way (figuratively) and it made me want to run. I eventually dug a little deeper and realized that it was because all my past relationships were very emotionally up and down and that was my standard due to how my parents treated me and eachother my whole life.

Turns out that love means not secretly resenting your partner."
ADHD,fg0vd63,t1_fg0rgtx,1580415759.0,"A lot of people dont but i believe there only needs to be something like an 80% match for a medication to be considered a generic. These differences may be minimal to some but i felt like the constant change really made it difficult for me and my psychiatrist to get a good dosage down. I remember having difficulty with determining how long i had coverage for. I rember the white square ones being the easiest to get ahold of and i guess the best but that could be due to consistancy.

Im sorry if thats not enough info but i certainly believe there is a difference, my psych even backed it up but unfortunately it can really be difficult to find a steady supply of the right manufacturer's pills."

I hypothesize that guys may feel like they have a harder time because its hard enough to find professional help, let alone know when to walk away from a bad one and call down the local list again. Maybe women are more used to the process or are more okay with asking about the process.

The whole process sucks."

Some people will never change when they are happily in a position of power like that. The breakup will suck but life is SO MUCH BETTER after working through the grief that comes from getting out of an abusive relationship.

I had to teach a doctor of mine that fact and she was pleasently suprised to see that i was right when she looked it up. So dont get mad at your doctor for not knowing if they initially dont believe you at first, get them to look it up."

AskReddit,ffsbenj,t1_ffs1miv,1580177706.0,If you dont have health insurance i suggest calling local psychiatrists offices and letting them know the spot you are in. Some will do a sliding scale discount and some will be super helpful and point you in the direction towards someone who may be able to do it for free. But you cant give up. Make sure to leave voicemails. Its hard but you can do this!
AskReddit,ffsb69d,t1_ffs19ky,1580177552.0,"Im sorry, the truth is that I have ADD and a lot of people who dont know enough about the disorder still make me feel like im a drug seeker and at times i really feel like im walking on eggshells in order to make sure i can get the medication i need. Im still in the stage where im trying different medications to get my dose right though.

Just dont get discouraged (us with ADD often do and thats okay). You will have to go see a psychiatrist to get formally diagnosed though so you will need to start by calling your insurance and getting a list of local psychs to try and schedule an appointment with."

ADHD,fevvxj0,t3_eqmwm2,1579402107.0,"I promise my story is going somewhere:

A few years ago I got an appointment with a gyno  for a reoccurring (semi-rare) issue after failed attempts to fix it with other doctors in her field (the last resort was a surgery but I was seen as too young to be a comfortable candidate). 

This woman had been awarded best in her field in Seattle that year, but even so she dismissed all of my concerns and quickly told me the issue was due to wearing tight pants. On one occasion she actually proceeded to try and end the appointment as soon as she got in the room by basically telling me the issue had not returned and it was all in my head. The only thing that got her to help me was my partner at the time turning to her as she began walking out the door and quickly yelled ""YOUR NOT EVEN GOING TO LOOK AT HER?""

Happy story at the end, I finally found a wonderful doctor who was very patient and compassionate with me and approved a surgery I ended up needing to fix my medical issue but the interactions leading up to that absolutely sucked.

My point is that sometimes you really will have to kind of shop around for doctors and some doctors you come across will just dismiss you because they know your shopping around but your health and wellbeing is more important than their misguided judgmental opinions.

Doctors are people and it's impossible for them to know everything, just try not to interpret their dismissal of you as a fault of yours.

Also personally I think it's hard to talk about but sometimes our condition can lead us to appear a little intense when we are distraught. Keep that in mind when approaching doctors, sometimes coming into a doctors office from a place of fear can be misinterpreted. State clearly how this condition is making life difficult for you with examples such as: 

- I have a lot of difficulty keeping my space clean and organized which affects getting to work on time
- I have difficulties with getting to work on time and I worry it's affecting my ability to hold down a job
- when I am medicated I notice I become a better driver
Etc."

It will extend upwards past the o ring but as soon as I try to lower it, it will stop not too far above the second screw on the other side of the red line resulting in only about an inch of movement.

Could one of you please measure for me the lowest your pole will adjust in inches from the bottom of the base to the the red line? I want to make sure my pole will adjust down further before I try anymore troubleshooting.

The picture above is the lowest my pole will adjust measured. 

I love my pole. The issue looks like it's not with the threading further up, but with the bottom of the first part of the top adjuster rod right where the red line is."

I doubt most women are paranoid about being hit on at the gym (I'm not). 

I certainly do however, remember the time a dude came up and interrupted my workout by adjusting the level on my machine for me while I was already confidently using it with headphones in.

I stopped him only to have to navigate through an awkward protest from him insisting on giving me tips (that I had not asked for).

That's the kind of stuff that can happen at a gym and honestly no level of  attractiveness would have changed how pissed off I was by the interaction."
