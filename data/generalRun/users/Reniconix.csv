Any higher above the $10m example I gave and the taxes paid are the same (by overall percentage not cash amounts) in either instance. 

US lottery jackpots advertise the 30-year payout after interest but before taxes. For example, the second-largest largest Mega Millions jackpot was advertised at $640 million, but in the fine print the actual jackpot was $462 million."
todayilearned,fein97v,t1_feib63t,1579142500.0,"Lottery winnings in the US are taxed. Gambling and game show winnings too. Winnings above $600 are automatically reported to the IRS. Payouts are considered income and taxed accordingly. For winnings above $5000, 25% of the total is automatically withheld by the IRS, prior to any payouts, but this does count towards your winnings-as-income tax (so if your payout total would come to require less than that initial 25% withholding, you owe nothing more, and may receive the difference on your federal returns, but you are on the hook for everything over that 25%)

For example, a $10 million jackpot would have $2.5 million automatically withheld. If you took the full cash payout up front, you would be taxed at the highest level for that year (for simplification, we'll say a flat tax of the US max 37% for earning over $510,301/yr across the board instead of the US incremental tax system). 25% has already been withheld, so you still owe the remaining 12% ($1.2 million) and your total payout after taxes is $6.3 million. 

If you took the standard 30-year equal-payout annuity, with yearly total payouts of $333,333.333333333 (I picked a bad number), that $2.5 million will still be withheld, but for the first 7.5 years, your income would not be taxed until you used up that pool of withheld money (or, more likely, when you file your federal returns, you will be refunded those taxes taken on income already taxed). After you have used up your withholdings, you will then be on the hook for those taxes again, however at a lower 35% rate since you have not met the $510,301/yr cutoff.

Edit: I was tired and accidentally said monthly payouts of an endless supply of 3s."

camaro,fdm04vi,t3_em0axa,1578536652.0,"Personal opinion, but I think it depends on the engine. The turbo and v6 have the same version of each transmission, which is different from the ss versions and the zl1 versions. The version of the 8-speed auto the turbo and v6 have isnt that great a pairing for the engine, and the manual outclasses them. Not to say that they are inherently bad, but not as good of a driving experience. The opposite is true in the SS, the 8-speed (2016-18) and 10-speed (19-20) outclasses the manual, and the 10-speed in the ZL1 is even better.

On paper, the autos are marginally faster in 0-60 and top speed across the board, and get better gas mileage due to the gearing scheme (and cylinder deactivation in the v6 and v8s), have super fast shifts, and can be really smooth but sometimes the 8-speeds have issues. Paddle shifters are a bit slow to react but when they do the shift is quick, and in manual mode you can hold the downshift paddle to immediately select the lowest possible gear for your engine speed. Each drive mode (Snow/Tour/Sport in the turbo and v6, +Track in the ss and zl1) has it's own unique shift algorithm for auto mode, and the SS/ZL1 have performance shift mode that you can activate in Sport and Track mode that holds you in a lower gear to keep you in the power.

The manuals have a ""no lift shift"" feature (except on 2016 turbo/v6) where you can leave the pedal on the floor while you upshift which works wonderfully to make your shifts quicker when you're really putting it down, a ""skip shift"" feature that forces you from 1st to 4th under light throttle to save fuel economy which is rather annoying, and as mentioned, rev matching (on the SS/ZL1 only) which just...works. It's just magic."

It all stems from making assumptions and opinions instead of getting clear cut guidance on ATF letterhead like most fringe case items (braces, binary trigger systems, AFGs on pistols, etc.) have done, but the systems that necessitate these things shouldn't be a thing on the first place. 

My personal opinion on the matter is that I will never pay an SBR/SBS tax stamp as long as current, official pistol brace rules apply. They are functionally identical to stocks, with the only limitation being they must be less than M16A2 length of pull (13.5"") to be shouldered. On my pistol, my brace (as with most collapsible versions that use milspec buffer tubes) extends to A1 length (12.875""). That is a difference of 5/8"". A VFG is a non issue for me, I prefer angled (which is a whole different can of worms right now).

Adding a VFG to a pistol creates an NFA-controlled ""any other weapon"" that must be registered the same as an SBR, which the dealer had not done nor was he making buyers do. 

If the guns would have been over the 26"" cutoff in their shortest configuration, they could have been equipped with a brace and vfg, and sold unrestricted as simple ""firearms"" instead of ""aow""."

Most of it, like British rationing, was designed to prevent price gouging more than actually conserve resources. It did help conserve, of course, but it was more about making people feel like they're helping and to keep people from buying up all the stock, claiming a shortage, and selling it extremely high."

Borderlands,fde0gpd,t3_ekuo6z,1578328376.0,"These guns are absolutely insane. My brother has a 17Kx2 non-elemental ion cannon on his clone/ drone Zane build, in no way optimized for anything but his personal play style, and his clone shooting the cannon is enough to one-shot most trash on M4, bar the 3-health bar badasses and anointed enemies. Clone fires with the bare minimum charge time and rarely makes critical hits. 

Mayhem was a slog for us before the dlc, struggling with m1 and m2 circles of slaughter, but now we lay waste to everything just by the addition of those guns and Zane's new mod."
