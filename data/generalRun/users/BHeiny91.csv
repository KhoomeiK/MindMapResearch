TheBullWins,ffn0yz8,t1_ffk4jph,1580060870.0,I’ve worked with horses and cows my entire life and let me tell you with a bull that size most helmets would have crumbled with a full weight step.  Most rodeo helmets are meant to protect from glancing blows and hitting the ground too hard when you fall off. When you have an animal going berserk that weighs as much as a sedan there aren’t many helmets that are going to help.  Granted I couldn’t tell exactly where on his head he was hit but it looked like the bull landed on his head.

BeAmazed,ffk2wdc,t1_ffk2i1n,1580014141.0,"It’s actually interesting to think that dogs think more like we do than chimps. When a dog has done something wrong and is punished they realize I’m being punished for doing this thing it must be bad I shouldn’t do it so I don’t get punished.  A chimp and other apes/monkeys don’t think that way. Famously Jane Goodall had 3 young chimps she kept in her hut in Africa. When one pooped on the floor or did something bad she would punish it to train it like a dog. She would show it the poo, slap it’s butt, and throw it out the window. The chimps didn’t understand this was a punishment but was able to recognize the pattern of behavior. So the next time the chimp pooped on the floor in the hut it smacked its own butt and jumped out the window.  In its mind that was simply the procedure."

I am a staunch atheist but my wife and all of her family are Jewish. She wants to teach our children Judaism as part of their upbringing and at first I was against it. However after viewing the cultural side of Judaism it struck me that it is more than simply a faith, it is about remember the history and teaching the traditions of the Jewish people even for those among the diaspora. I think it can be all too easy for the people of the Jewish diaspora to loose their history and culture to the dominant cultural of Christianity here in the states and so I have come to support her in her decision to raise our children in the Jewish tradition and faith."

I have known that chronic despair of pain that feels like it will never go away so I cannot chastise anyone for wanting to simply put an end to the pain.
