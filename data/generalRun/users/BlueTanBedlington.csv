Wrangler JL received 1-star crash test due to insufficient crumple zones, poor side-impact, and the likelihood of serious injury to rear passengers, especially children. Wranglers with metal front/rear bumpers also appear less damaged in accidents, but this only translates to more force being delivered to the occupants vs crumple zones reducing much of that force. 

As for build quality and reliability; from what I read about Land Rovers, they're just as unreliable as what I have experienced in our JL. But JL's currently in court for pisspoor welding jobs and the infamous death-wobble. Not to mention all the rusting in the undercarriage on every single Wrangler going back to the JKs. 

New Defender by no means is as attractive as its predecessors, but I think they hit it out the park in capability and aftermarket parts. It's definitely not a rock climber, but I would say it's the most capable non-truck overlander straight out of the factory: Payload 1984lbs, towing 8201lbs, dynamic roof 370lbs, static roof 661lbs."
