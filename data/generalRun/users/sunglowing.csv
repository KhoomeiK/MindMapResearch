offmychest,fcpk2kj,t3_eiarwd,1577866096.0,"I feel you absolutely. My parents donâ€™t talk to each other at all but live under the same roof. I fought with my mom one day and I told her why hasnâ€™t she divorced if sheâ€™s so unhappy. She told me that theyâ€™re still married solely because of me. Both my parents are cheaters and I feel so devastated(?) because Iâ€™m the reason why they truly canâ€™t be happy and Iâ€™m honestly really ashamed to tell my friends about them. I look at my friendsâ€™ parents and they look so happy???? They go out to eat dinners, travel overseas as a family but I canâ€™t have any of that anymore."
