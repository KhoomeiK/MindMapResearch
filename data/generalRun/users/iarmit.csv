directsupport,ff4rhab,t3_ermszj,1579570677.0,"Have you thought about getting into Supported  Employment and getting your [CESP](https://apse.org/cesp-central/)?

I started as a DSP within my company's employment department. Basically I did the same thing community support would do, but I was on site with people at their job (so in many ways, an ""easier"" job). But, because it wasn't day/community hours (9-3 or so) no one at my company likes being a Job Coach. That made it very easy for me to get promoted to Vocational Specialist (which is basically 1 part Job Coaching, 1 part Vocational Assessments for my state VR office). I now make the same pay as a Site/Field Supervisor (in my company, YMMV).

But, having the CESP means I can go anywhere in the country (as it's a national certification)."
