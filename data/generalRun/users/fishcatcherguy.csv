You are patently incorrect in regards to the Obama administration ignoring poverty. From https://www.epi.org/blog/the-obama-legacy-on-wages/ : 

> The two most important of these institutions are legislated minimum wages and unions. **The federal minimum wage last saw an increase in 2009, but by 2010, Congress was controlled by Republicans, so proposals that the administration backed that would have increased the federal minimum wage were not passed.** The administration did, however, use its regulatory power over federal contractors to mandate that these employers pay at least $10.10 an hour. The administration also mandated that these employers provide paid sick leave, refrain from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and offer pay transparency as a measure to combat discrimination in wage-setting.

Also:

> Early in the administration’s tenure, Congress failed to pass the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA), a reform to labor law that aimed to re-level the playing field between workers who want to organize a union and employers that want to stop this. **EFCA had the backing of the administration and almost surely the majority of Congress before 2010 when Democrats controlled both chambers. It did not, however, have a filibuster-proof 60 votes in the Senate, so it did not become law.**

You can argue that more work needs to be done to combat poverty, and I would agree. I don’t understand why you would argue *against* healthcare for all because enough has not been done to increase the income of those in poverty. That is *your* black and white stance, not the lefts.
