atheism,ffaqqib,t1_ff9wsu7,1579742275.0,"He kind of is. If the situation really boiled down to one or a handful of citizens calling their senators, it wouldn't exist. The inclusion of religious language and practice in our government is more complex than that and is supported by a large number of constituents. 

While it's wrong and unconstitutional, it's politically difficult to fight against because the citizens on your side don't really care about it that much (there are much bigger problems at hand) and the minority of citizens in favor of it are still very vocal group and this would be amongst their core issues. In other words, any politician thinking about taking on religious language in government would gain very little support and recognition from his base and would be unrelentingly vilified by his opposition. It just doesn't make sense to spend political capital on something that would be nice to change, but could potentially ruin your career.

TL;DR Oversimplification is stupid (lmao). This is a very small issue for those who are against it, but it means the world to the people who support it making it something no one wants to touch."
