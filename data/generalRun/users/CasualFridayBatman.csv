That scene is so fucking good, especially since Ethan goes on a rampage right after. I could watch him run forever."

>I say this from the perspective of someone who is mentally ill, everyone is wholly responsible for their own actions and well-being. It's okay to help, and it's okay to _want_ help, but it's not okay to continue acting in a harmful way and excusing it with mental illness. That's just not fair to anyone.

>If you realize that you're acting in a way that is hurting those around you because of your illness, that means it's time to seek help, not to demand that your surroundings deal with it.
