Onision,ffdged8,t1_ffdf0vg,1579820317.0,"**"" You don't think his tweets to Kai about knowing any toddlers they could date is suspicious and weird as fuck? Greg makes a lot of outlandish/vulgar/inflammatory statements just to be inflammatory but as we have found out, a lot of them he actually means. He also has sex in front of his kids, and treats them in the same type of grooming behavior he does towards his victims. There's reason to be suspicious of him doing something of that nature to his own children. Being suspicious =/= 100% fact. But it should be treated as a legitimate concern. ""**

I never said those things, did I? Of course the things he has done are extremely suspect. Your not listening very well either, I said THERE IS NO PROOF THAT HE IS MOLESTING HIS CHILDREN, OR PUSHED THEM OUT OF THE WINDOW, SO WE SHOULD NOT MAKE THOSE CALIMS AS IF THEY ARE FACTUAL....

Again not listening...

**"" You can't tell me to go away on a reddit thread after responding to me lol. You made generalized accusations in your post towards people who have concerns about him possibly molesting his children and, based on your way of talking with that all or nothing 'I'm right/your wrong' attitude, I made random accusations at you right back. ""**

Yes I can tell you to go away, BC your first thought was to accuse me of being Trumpian and a MAGA  hat wearing nut. SOmething that had 0 to do with the thread or discussion. Since you seem to be brain dead I never said you cannot suspect he is harming his daughter in any way, I said you cannot claim he is doing os factually BC there is 0 evidence to corroborate that. Suspicion is not proof. 

I can sit here all day and say I think he is molesting his kid and there is plenty of reason to be suspicious, but I cannot with fact say he is. I have seen others do this and all I am saying is, ensure your thoughts are being expressed as an opinion and not as a fact..."

Onision,ffcsz4o,t1_ffcrmcl,1579806632.0,I was only giving a TLDR of what I meant in such a long winded post. I only put out that many act like they are experts and make claims that are mostly opinions or allegations based off nothing. These things breed the spread of bad information. Being a lil aggressive in my approach is part of me trying to catch attention to the issue. It got you to respond did it not?
Onision,ffcstnv,t1_ffcrdem,1579806544.0,"Read much?

I never claimed to be an expert and all the assessments made in the post are based off my experience from past careers and my current career path.  I am not here making crazy assumptions that had 0 basis of evidence and research backing it up."
Onision,ffcsmja,t1_ffcryz4,1579806428.0,Its a massive reach and sorry if you cannot prove it then you shouldn't make such claims. Now go away your 1st response told me all I need to know about you.
RightwingLGBT,ffcs38b,t3_edxwo7,1579806108.0,"IDK how I managed to miss this news as I was actually pretty cool with Prince of Queens. He has been on multiple streams of mine in the past few years and it saddens me that last I was able to speak with him was last Halloween where he randomly popped up in my chat and decided to join me and just chat about nonsense. I wish I would have known about this last month and I feel like a real jack ass now. 

Anyway guess I will say a few things now. Prince was a very kind hearted guy who greatly cared about the topics he discussed. He never threw hate at anyone for disagreeing with him. There are times I would think he would get a lil out there in some things he discussed, but he never cared, he voiced his thoughts and stood by what he believed, something I truly respected. 

He was an inspiration for many of his following, he did what he did BC he cared for the LGBT community. 

He was a good man and though I'm late to the news, I wish him nothing but peace where ever he may be now and my condolences to his family.

It was an honor to know him...

He once gave his opinion on Queer Kid Stuff a long time ago when I made the below video:

Onision,ffcgm0v,t1_ffcdzvl,1579799024.0,"Did I say he doesn't make mistakes,no I didn't. I said all too many of folks here are acting like they know better and as if they are the experts. In the span of a 40 years a professional will make mistakes, I get that. everyone wants to act like they know better than he and that he has no credibility to him. Sorry, far too many times has he shined than he has messed up. 

""affair, bounced checks"", These aren't even relevant within the investigation. The others ok I can see your points there, but it also asks the question, how many time has he been right compared to any times he messed up?

""Due to Chris Hansen's approach to ""catching a predator"" back in 2006""
What going to approach the suspect as he has done in all his previous cases. Was he suppose to know the man will do what he did?

""has been known to broadcast suspects and testimonies to the media to entice a story.""- Please point to me a journalist that will not do something like this. Testimonies in court cases are often public to begin with, unless it is by request of court order to not have them publicly available. 

 ""coerced false statements"" - if this is true please cite the sources, also the next question is how often has this been done. Was it habitual of him, or was it a small amount of cases? 

These are questions to ask..."
Onision,ffcap6o,t1_ffc61fk,1579795352.0,"I get that, thing is he is only saying what he knows and he will be told exactly the same amount of information that we would be told by the authorities.

Onision,ffc4kww,t1_ffbyush,1579791378.0,None of this is strange at all. Police will not reveal details like that to civilians or the public in any way.

Something everyone forgets is that even though Greg was a washed moron in the military and couldn't cut it, he still served and even went to SERE school as well. Having served in the Navy I can tell you one thing they teach all the time to service members is how to handle a medical emergency and how to handle the victim. They teach you right away never move the victim until proper professionals arrive. They teach how to stabilize and what nit, but never move them.

Thing is telling others to deal with it and get over it, isn't about victim blaming in any way. Its about the fact that you cannot expect the players or the devs to change things to fit specifically you and  few others that have an issue with something. The issue is people mis-use that phrase of victim blaming. Now IM not excusing that behavior, but in this case you still do have full control on having to hear or read their BS. 

Everyone who plays this game gets the BS too, we just learn to move on and ignore it. As you said Shit talk is part of it all and yes some do just cross the line.

I can fully agree that NRS could and should have included a mute button in game, BC its a simple fix and almost every game does this. I suppose they saw the Party Chat as a solution and decided it wasn't worth the extra time and money to implement (although doesn't seem like a huge issue to develop).

Thing is , something can be done when you get hate mail or a-holes  on voice chat. You are able to report these people and get them banned and punished. I always see things like how Online Gaming needs more ways to be more friendlier online. Though the tools exist already.

You are fully in control of your own online experience. If you don't want DMs you can set that. If you don't want messages from some a-hole, you can block them. If you hate their voice BC they are talking shit, you can use a method to mute them depending on the game and report them. If someone is sending you threats and hate you can report them and get them banned. The options are there you just have to use them. No one should ever expect that people will behave online and not use shitty behavior. You can't make people change, but you can use the tools you have to avoid dealing with people like that."

The outrage stuff is growing out of style more and more lately. People are starting to get drained from hearing it all the time and its even more apparent when you see sites are writing crazier and crazier headlines lately with even more hot takes than usual.  The outrage culture is drying up and for these bloggers and ""Journos"" will have to learn to evolve and change their style to survive in that world, or seek employment elsewhere in another field. 

There is nothing wrong with working in a grocery store, or as a server. Those jobs may suck, but its income and to many out there its all they got. She can better herself and push to make something more of herself, but it all depends on her and her alone. As someone said below maybe it will teach some humility, esp seeing her fellow co-workers talk about their struggles with paying the bills and taking care of the kids. Imagine her being told by some co-worker that they had to go without that xmas just so they could buy their kid some game they really wanted and it turns out to be one of those games her and her ilk tried to ruin with their BS. Working a menial job is something these people need to do at least a 1 year of their lives to understand the shit people go through. 

In the end though she could just Learn To Code!!!"

As far as exposing shitty people being shitty on voice or in DMs, yeh IDC I'm gonna expose them. I see some will black out their User Names, naaa I want everyone to see the shitty behavior so everyone knows who to avoid online. I don't condone them being harassed by others, something I tend to point out when I stream, but if enough see them as what they are then they will have trouble getting games in. 

I look at it like this, You don't know who is on the other side of the screen. It could be a guy or woman streaming live to a large audience, then you just made a fool of yourself on air. It could be a young child (yes I know a kid shouldn't play MK but doesn't mean it don't happen). If you put yourself out there like that to a stranger online, you should know that those messages aren't likely to remain private and your not even entitled to that."

He is fulfilling his ethical requiremnets to how his job works. I know most journalists today have 0 ethcs and just make shit up, but Hansen is old school. 

Thsi si no different than the police knocking on your door to ask you questions about a  crime that was commited. He respected boundaries by not busting down the door or snakeing around his house. WHen police were called he stepped away. 

Damn you  thick headed"

Onision,feeduif,t1_fee0wnb,1579031716.0,"""When were you smart about thinking it’s okay to visit people when they did not ask? Greg refuses to speak with Chris and should’ve left him alone.""

Again, you should prolly stop talking BC I see intelligence is not your strong suit. No one has to ask permission visit anyone's home. Anyone can legaly walk up and knock on your door to speak with you. Its not illegal, nor is it even morallly wrong. By your rediculous logic then the mail person should ask persmission to drop off a package at your door. 

So to humor and answer your quite idiotic question, yes its ok to visit someone unasked. You have the right to not answer your door, but you don't get to say someone cannot knock on your front door. Its as if you never had an unannounced visitor knock on your door before. 

So to further go on, let jsut address allthat you said so far.

You claimed he Doxxed Greg, that is false. His address is public information and Hansen did publicly post that address or any other information with the intention of causing harm, or inciting others to cause harm to him. 

for your seccond part, well its been adressed already in this post. 

I know logic is a hard for one of your IQ. Good day and thanks for playing."
