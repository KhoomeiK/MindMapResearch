Strava,fcwmvy3,t3_ef9oua,1578030158.0,"Completely possible he’s weight doping, for one, OP. 

You manually enter your weight and height, so if you’re 75 kg in real life, enter 70 on Zwift, and ride at 150 watts in-game, your power to weight ratio is much improved, and thus your speed far greater. 

I’d also be curious to know what power source he’s using. I started on a cheap mag wheel trainer and a cyclops hub power meter. My numbers were way off compared to my Tacx Neo. I wasn’t intentionally trying to pad my numbers; I just didn’t have an accurate power source to know any better. 

There’s also the possibility of turning down the resistance on the trainer. You still have to put out the same power to go the same speed, but the feedback on your legs from say a 5% grade isn’t there. You could hold a certain power with no fluctuations if you’d like. Say what you will: but 200 watts with 0 resistance feels different than 200 Watts up a 9% grade to me. My brain, legs, and cadence would also agree. 

Tl;dr

There are those who do it right, and those who pad the numbers. Not sure the type of person your buddy is, or if it’s just an equipment gift of extra watts. 

If you’re curious. GCN did a video comparing a climb up Alpe D’Huez on Zwift and then in real life. The times were only minutes apart, but of course, wind, temperature, etc does give Zwift the slight time advantage. Same sustained effort. Same “course.” Shockingly near identical times. 

And to those who say Zwift is a toy: you get out of it what you put in. Your imagination and effort are the limit. I’d much rather ride during -20 temps than not at all; Zwift is the best way for me to do that without going insane. 

Ride on."

My favourite was always Lugia. 

I’m the oldest child of three, and the only girl. My brothers and I hadn’t ever connected as friends . . . until Gold and Silver came out. 

We’d all played Red, Blue, and Yellow, , but had somehow instantly understood the epic journey that would be Gold and Silver. 

For the months leading up to the game’s release, we’d cram ourselves onto the bottom bunk of my brother’s bed, and plan who was going to get what starter, and what Pokémon we thought were from previews. 

I was 12, and my brothers 9 and 7. 

We’d draw them under the bed frame of the top bed, with our names under it, like a bad wall of Pokémon graffiti. 

I chose Lugia, and adorned my name underneath, along with the other Pokémon I hoped to catch. 

In the end, Gold and Silver brought my brothers and I together—the whole franchise did, really. It’d become our Rosetta Stone for communicating, and we’ve been close, since. 

Fast forward 20 years. 

I recently helped my brother move from our hometown; I’d moved from the country, but flew down to see him off. All packed up, and ready to leave, he grabbed my hand, and put something in it.

There was Lugia, with his arms outstretched, looking up at me: my childhood copy of Silver. 

Say what you will about GF, and the corners they’ve cut over the years, but if any kid has even an ounce of the love and connection to others as I did in 1999 and again this year, they’re doing it right.

I could easily get a Pokémon to 100 in two days, sans candy, by hitting all the high XP mon in the Wild Area over and over. 

The Pokémon you haven’t isn’t within the realm of impossibility. If you’re worried, don’t battle competitively with it.

It’s also possible the OG trainer bred this, levelled it up, kept trying for their shiny boy/girl, got the shiny they wanted, had this one that would go unused, and traded it as a nice gesture.
