psychedelicsupport,fettsbg,t3_eqlngd,1579379988.0,"It sounds more like you need to take a break from smoking weed.

I blazed pretty much every day for about 10 years. My anxiety reached a level that was just unbearable but I didn’t attribute it to smoking herb. An old therapist of mine suggested I take a break. In October I stopped for a couple of months and my overall anxiety went WAY down. 

Since then I’ve smoked maybe 5 times and those times it was only like one hit. It didn’t make me too anxious but I also wasn’t that into it.

I have however taken mushrooms, DMT, and ketamine since then. Those were all fine. Was supposed to take LSD yesterday but I called it off cuz I have a cold.

Also, unless you have serious mental health issues, I seriously doubt you’ll permanently “lose your mind.”"

raisedbynarcissists,feg10ym,t1_feg0qgr,1579072339.0,I told all my friends at school I wanted to die. One of them told his mother and she came over to my house late at night after I’d gone to bed. I knew they were talking about me. It went on for hours. Then they came in my room and made a big hysterical thing about it where I was basically apologizing the whole time. Then there were psychiatric evaluations and therapy and all that but I was basically made to feel like I did something to my parents by being depressed. After a year it was decided I was done with therapy and I was made the scapegoat and treated as the cause of all family dysfunction thereafter. I went NC for a while then went back and recently decided to go VLC but moving toward NC again.

DMT,fdudc30,t1_fdu5xmy,1578731392.0,"I’m with you on that, u/mrpoopybutth0le.

When I see jesters, I see them as representations of distracting thoughts. Like a challenge to my focus. More often than jesters, I see beings that are like cosmic yogis that tell me I should just relax, that I’m doing just fine, and that I’m “starting to get it.”

I feel that much of the psychedelic experience in general is like a little taste of meditation made perfect. As I continue to work with DMT, I feel like what it’s trying to teach me is HOW to be on DMT; how to be present and fully appreciate the enormity of such a bewildering experience. Extrapolating that lesson out a level, I feel like what those experiences are telling me is that the whole point of LIFE is learning how to live every moment of that bewildering enormous experience genuinely, appreciatively, consciously."

My parents sent me to therapy for a year to save face but it didn’t really get better from there. They designated me as the cause of my family’s dysfunction and used me as a scapegoat for the rest of my life.

tripreport,fdpfi6g,t3_emj3nw,1578627283.0,"Sounds like a good time.

You should know that there is a big difference between  N,N DMT (DMT) and 5-MeO-DMT.

100mg of DMT is a HUGE dose. I’ve smoked DMT over 30 times and never went above 55mg.

100mg of 5-MeO-DMT is enough for TEN PEOPLE to take a HUGE dose. I’ve never done 5-MeO but from my friends’ accounts, this kind of dose would have shattered you to the edge of screaming insanity. Like you’d probably have PTSD afterward.

Reading your report and considering the method you used, I think you smoked DMT (not 5-MeO-DMT) and - if you indeed packed 100mg - you maybe got about half of that dose actually into your body."

There’s this DMT idiom of, “take the third hit!” With the Yocan that’s unnecessary. One long, slow, deep hit while repeatedly pulsing the coil (3 seconds on, 1 second off) and and before I know it I’m gone. The reminder that I’ve just smoked DMT comes when the vaporizer lands in my lap after I drop it.

Some people swear by the dual quartz coil. One of these days I’ll try it I guess. The ceramic just works really well for me."

EstrangedAdultChild,fcte8vg,t1_fct21pz,1577940471.0,"There are two things about this post and comment thread that totally triggered me.

The title of the original post and it’s use in the post itself: “You’ll always be my baby” is one. This was a phrase used by my narcissistic mother to infantilize me my entire life. I was emotionally manipulated into thinking that I was not capable of living without my mother’s “love” and “help” well into adulthood. I (46/m) didn’t move out of my parents’ home until I was 27 and my younger brother didn’t get out until he was 28. Even after I got out, my mother used the idea that I’ll “always be her little baby” to make me feel inadequate and interfere in my affairs well into my mid-30s when I went NC for the first time. When I hear the words “you’ll always be my baby” the only thing I can think is, “No. Someday I’ll be a bitter, broken, middle-aged man who resents your mistreatment and wants you out of his life forever.” I can’t be the only one in this group who’s experienced this.

The other thing that bothered me is the idea of shielding your children from your bad history with your abusive parents. While I don’t have kids and probably never will, I’m pretty sure that covering up history is always a bad move. Both my parents (especially my father) hid or fictionalized some, if not all, of their family history from my brother and I. My mother’s family history has been whitewashed and idealized (the fact that there were closet alcoholics all over it was lost on me until only recently). I know next to nothing about my father’s side of my family (especially my grandfather, who died when my father was 5. I have no idea what my grandfather was like or even how he died). It’s always made me feel incomplete and alien from friends of mine who, for better or worse, actually knew their families. At this point, knowing any of the actual truth in the narrative about either side of my family history would give me very valuable context for understanding the behavior of my parents. Our histories are big pieces of the puzzle that we all need to feel whole whether we have good childhoods or not.

Just some food for thought."
PsychedelicTherapy,fcoydfi,t1_fcohbqn,1577845000.0,"I hear everything you’re saying!

For me I kind of stumbled drunk into my spiritual awakening with shrooms. I chanced into a connection and hadn’t taken psychedelics since high school and I was having an “everything old is new again” moment. I was eating piles of shrooms willy-nilly and having a pretty fun time with them. So, in a sense, I hedonistically worked up to taking therapeutic doses without really understanding what I was doing. The night I had my spiritual awakening, I was trying to take a break from drinking. I made a tea with 5.5 grams and sat down to watch Fantasia because I thought that would be fun. I quickly got lost in the music and closed my eyes and stopped watching the movie and it just happened. Without getting into too much detail, I was brought to a magical place and a voice spoke to me and I wept. I realized that I was not separate from god and I knew that things would never be the same. That was in early March of 2018. I followed that up with a 4 more trips that year ranging from 4 to 7.5 grams. Two of those were completely terrifying but very useful. I hear about people having guides and trip-sitters but I’ve never used them aside from friends who were tripping with me. I figure I’ll need one when I finally use ayahuasca or 5-Meo-DMT or iboga. 

Bill W.’s spiritual awakening happened during a belladonna treatment. He also took part in LSD experiments in the 50s where he had deep spiritual experiences and advocated strongly for its use despite strong opposition from the fellowship he founded. It always struck me as odd that AA could claim that their program alone could provide the spiritual awakening required to end addiction when that was not the experience of its founder. Also, I never met anyone in a 12-step fellowship that properly meditated at all and I didn’t come to any understanding of meditation until after my “post-relapse” adult experiences with psychedelics. 

When I left the program I had a total philosophical break from them and could tell you all the ways the 12 steps were just a fucked up cult indoctrination tool. Since having multiple intense spiritual experiences on mushrooms, LSD, and DMT, I kind of think the steps are pretty right on and find myself practicing the principles naturally. But I know for sure I’d have never arrived at this place without the experiences I’ve had. Also, I don’t measure the success of how I improve my life by anyone else’s metrics anymore. “Sobriety” is not measured by a duration of time. It’s a state of mind. In the last 18 months I’ve got off my anti-depressant medication, I’ve stopped overworking myself to exhaustion at my job (I’m a bartender, by the way), I stopped drinking entirely (today is one year), I stopped habitually smoking pot every day (I’ve smoked three times in the last 3 months), I stopped smoking cigarettes. I eat better. I meditate every day. Yeah, I’ll probably take LSD tomorrow to celebrate the new year but I’ll still be more sober than I’ve ever been in my life.

Don’t get me wrong. I’m still pretty screwed up and I’ve got a lot of work to do, both with and without psychedelics. I think in 2020 I’ll definitely be going back to therapy to deal with childhood trauma. Fuck that “fuck your feelings” bullshit. And also fuck “character defects.” We are not broken machines that need to be fixed. We are complete but wounded humans that need to be healed. Traumatized people have a hard time seeing a future with them in it and have trouble seeing themselves outside of the trauma they are locked in. You don’t look at a hurt, terrified child and think, “See that egomaniac cowering in the corner? That kid needs to get over himself.” I think there’s a lot that 12-step fellowships claim to understand that is way beyond the scope of their expertise.

I think if you trust in yourself you’re gonna find what you’re looking for! Best of luck!"
PsychedelicTherapy,fcob1n2,t3_ei87d1,1577827873.0,"I spent 15 years in recovery and then another 10 years on a bender before high doses of mushrooms brought me the spiritual awakening that the 12-steps were never able to. After that I just couldn’t enjoy drinking anymore and eventually stopped (today is one year without a drink for me). For me they were exactly what I needed to get where I needed to go.

That said, I don’t think mushrooms are necessarily the answer for everyone. Your anxieties, both about the trip going wrong and about potential fallout with your family/peer group, seem to point to this being not such a great idea at the moment. 

Trips don’t “go wrong.” They go the way they go. Sometimes it’s beautiful and sometimes it’s really ugly. Either way, if you anxiously fight it, it’s total agony. Some of the most terrifying, miserable, I-think-I’m-dying, I-wish-I-was-dead trips I’ve had were the most important trips of my life. I learned some really intense stuff about myself in them. You need to remember that therapy of any kind, whether it’s psychological or physical or rehabilitative or psychedelic, isn’t of itself supposed to be fun or beautiful. It’s about HARD WORK. 

Also, for me 1.5 grams is what I’d call a recreational dose, not a therapeutic dose. You might wanna ask yourself what your real motivations are for doing this. If you have to sneak around with your family and AA group to do this and you’re not planning to do some deep work with this substance then is there really a point?"
Petioles,fclmwv9,t3_ehrzrq,1577751548.0,"After 10 years of daily use, I took October and November off from smoking. It wasn’t so much a T-break as it was an experiment to see how I felt without it. After the reflexive habit of reaching for my bong went away I didn’t really miss it. Also my anxiety went way down and I started sleeping a lot better.

I smoked 3 times this December, each time just like 1 or 2 hits off a joint or a one-hitter. Each time it was ok but it certainly wasn’t like reuniting with an old friend or anything. It was just like ok yeah now I’m high. Sure. I actually kind of think I was fooling myself all those years that I loved getting high so much.

TripSit,fcl2p86,t3_ehosjk,1577738509.0,"The reason you haven’t experienced anxiety on shrooms is because you’re barely taking trip level doses. 10g fresh is equal to about 1g dried. That’s like a get-high-and-groove-at-a-concert dose. Totally fun but hardly a trip let alone therapeutic.

EstrangedAdultChild,fckvzj9,t3_ehlzqg,1577734384.0,"I went VLC with my whole family (again) after a violent incident at my birthday dinner over the summer. I’m only allowing engagement via the mail for birthdays and pertinent holidays. I’ve broken my own boundary a few times - texting when I sent birthday cards late - because I didn’t want to appear flaky or uncaring. Despite it allowing my mother room to bait me with some emotionally manipulative bullshit, it hasn’t seemed to open the door too much and I’ve managed to not take any of the bait. 

I have disownment fears but I also think worrying about getting cut from their will is a continuation of buying into a long-standing economic manipulation anyway. I’ve made grandiose statements when I’ve cut contact in the past and they never satisfied anything for me. I’ve also thought about having individual face-to-face meetings with all the members of my family to discuss the issues but decided against that realizing I’d be just setting traps for myself to get ensnared in. 

For now I’m just gonna keep VLC, put all communication in writing, keep my end of our communication kind, control my own narrative, and let the chips fall where they may. If they wanna disown me for that, then so be it. The fact that they think they own me in the first place is kind of at the heart of the matter anyway.

Mushrooms talk to me every time I take over 4 grams or so on an empty stomach.   It’s become the main reason I take them. It’s like a direct telepathic communication with some entity that knows me better than I do. Sometimes it’s very gentle and supportive. Sometimes it’s really harsh. Every time it tells me something I need to hear. I don’t attempt to rationalize it because I feel that would cheapen what I get out of it.

The most significant thing that ever happened to me on mushrooms was on a night where my intent was to just “have fun.” I closed my eyes and was brought to a science fiction looking place and a voice told me, “you don’t need to do the shit that sucks anymore.” Seems so simple and almost silly but it changed my life. Over the next 2 years I’ve been dumping shit that sucks from my life and making it better. I got off my antidepressants, quit drinking, changed my work schedule so I wasn’t overworking myself, quit habitually smoking pot every day, and quit smoking cigarettes."
