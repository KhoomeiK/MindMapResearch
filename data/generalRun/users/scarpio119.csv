trashy,fd9weqb,t3_ek28oi,1578238814.0,"I read that Carnival's fleet of cruise ships pollute 10 times more each year than all of the cars in Europe combined. It's disgusting and I would encourage everyone who reads this to reconsider ever going on a cruise in their lifetime. I will never step foot on one for the rest of my life.

I never sugar coat that shit to anyone because it's the honest truth, but let me reassure you that it's worth the effort and it *does* get better. You're already headed in the right direction and taking a stand to get your life back, don't let one new year's throw you for a loop. There's a whole new life waiting for you on the other side of all this shit, and it's fucking beautiful man. You just have to make it thru the next few months (for me easily the first 3 months were most difficult), and you *will* find yourself again. Be strong my dude, you're in a battle for your life and you're going to make it because this isn't the way your story ends. You've got a purpose in life beyond being an alcoholic. Best of luck to you on your journey..."
