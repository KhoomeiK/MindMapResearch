Saw one a few days ago and decided if it was still there it was mine. It wasn’t. Of course, I wasn’t leaving without a rescue. This mini phal “ice cube” caught my eye.

Politics in restaurants is reality. I’m assuming she’s been there longer than you and you have no idea what her relationship with management is. It’s called seniority. So yea, the rules are different for her than you. Welcome to the business. Kill her with kindness. More flies with honey and all that... Seriously. Walk in every day with a big smile and make sure you say hello. If you marry catsups your way and she tells you to do it another way... do it her way. Better yet ask her advice, like how would she do something... End of it. And never double dip. And, yes, we lifers do believe in cooties. (Give yourself enough time and you will too.) Get a plate and scoop a couple of spoonfuls. Everyone’s happy. And if you’re new in the place, everyone’s paying attention including management. And believe me, she’s running to them bitching. And management hates that. (Don’t let anyone fool ya on that.) 

So, killer kindness. Everything’s done their way, not yours. Just say OK. Consider others. No tattling. (And don’t bitch to your co-workers, they’re all talking.) Oh, and let shit roll off your back. Thick skin. You’ll be just fine. Make$$"

If my only choice was Democrat trump or sane republican, I probably wouldn’t be happy but I would vote republican. (As long as the GOP got back to normal.) I did like Kasich. Couldn’t vote for McCain with Palin. But might without her. And would be a strong maybe with Romney. There are some Republicans I do like.

In 2020 these things shouldn’t even be a debate. Any Republican who works for all the people, not just a base, would get my consideration. I can deal with some conservative issues.

Because we are bewildered how he was elected in the first place. And the fact that 30% of the population thinks he was chosen from God, the greatest president in history, doing a great job, and are ready for a civil war (NOT A JOKE) if he loses. (WTF) Mind boggling! 

He is “the Manchurian Candidate “. (Please look it up if you don’t know what that means. Not trying to be disrespectful it’s just I know a lot of young people are here and it is to long to explain.) The republicans have been chipping away at our democracy for 30-40 yrs. The republicans hated Clinton. (Say what you will, he was a great President. And the republicans hated him. Tried from day one to remove him. And his downfall was lying about a blow job. True.) Then 8 yrs. of Bush (who won by a stolen election) We know how that went. Then the republicans had a half black man in the White House. They’re heads exploded.(Again say what you will Obama was a great President in spite of 8 yrs of grid-lock by republicans.) They were brutal to this man and he always acted with grace and dignity. Oh, and no scandals. And In spite of the republicans he accomplished some great things. 

trump grew up in an environment with a father who was a card carrying member of the Klu Klux Clan. He’s a white nationalist . He proudly said this at one of his rallies. (I watch them all on C-SPAN) He’s not a self made millionaire. He’s an atrocious business man and refused renting to minorities in the 70s. American banks refused to lend him money years ago. Why he turned to Germany, Russia, Saudi Arabia, China... basically any one who would lend him money. And he’s been laundering money for them for yrs. They own him. That’s why they wanted him elected. Hell, he bankrupted a fucking casino! He’s a pedophile, rapist. Jeffrey Epstein was a very close friend and he use to go to his parties. There is a rape case pending from a victim from 15 yrs ago. He’s a tax fraud. (I mean “I don’t pay my taxes that makes me a genius.”) NY is still investigating his taxes. Compulsive liar. Excellent at gaslighting. And everyone else has used all the other words. Also a really bad actor.

The republicans, lead by McConnell, who is the most dangerous man in politics (Kentucky please do your job in November) he’s using his puppet expertly. It’s McConnell’s goal to erase the black mans accomplishments. They want to erase Obama’s legacy. BTW they can’t. Most of the old men in politics are racists. Pure and simple. They must go. We can’t wait for them to die. And they know that by dividing the country they will be able to get away with anything. And we are letting them. 

One good thing he has done. He woke us up. He showed us how divided this country is. My question to you, all of you? What do we do to fix this? Really curious what you think."

YangForPresidentHQ,fekoc52,t1_fejkjxg,1579204225.0,"Ha. Jinnyjuice, I have to tell you... I’m sitting here watching the beginning of the impeachment trial. I am so disheartened, disgusted, and exhausted by the last 3 yrs of this administration. The whole country is. The evil, cruel, dangerous dealings of this government is like nothing I’ve seen in my life. I watched when JFK, RFK, MLK were assassinated. And I’ve watched the Vietnam war on TV while eating dinner. And protested. (And wore copper bracelets with soldiers names on them.) I saw Nixon resign. This is so much worse. I (we) fought for clean air, water, and food. Protested for women’s rights, children’s rights, workers rights, wildlife, and environment. And won. It sickens me to see everything that we fought for (and won) be destroyed by these criminals for the sake of a buck. We are an embarrassment around the world. The thought of having to fight again is exhausting. But, I will. Again. 

We are so divided in this country, families don’t speak to each other. Extremists are ready for another civil war! People are being murdered because of hate. Babies are existing in conditions that we get outraged when we find out animals are kept that way. (Anti-abortion voices? Yea. Right.) And we, the people, are responsible for allowing this to become normal. Silence is compliance. Where is our voice America? Is this who we’ve become?

That being said... Andrew Yang represents everything that’s good in a human being. #HumanityFirst. He lives it. Everything he says is with the people of the US in mind first. He’s young, extremely intelligent, (dare I say a real actual “stable genius”) thoughtful, and kind. You can physically see it. He’s also funny and a little goofy at times. So charming. So up-lifting. When he speaks you are compelled to listen. And you can see, when he’s asked a question, he thinks then answers. Thoughtful, coherent responses, always with the American people in mind. And he has really great, workable plans. He understands what the future will be. He’s a visionary. He explains his plans in a way regular “Joe Schmo’s” like me can understand. Never beats around the bush. NEVER not answering questions with deflection. He’s honest. He’s NOT a politician. One of the reasons why people voted for trump. I could gush on...

It’s obvious he can unite this country. Just note who’s following him here. People from around the world are excited about this man. There’s a reason for that. He was missed at the last debate. Why is that? The people of the US are mostly good, compassionate, caring patriots. We love this country and want it to remain the Greatest country in the world. The track that we’re on is just plain wrong. Andrew Yang, in my opinion, is the only person that can unite us, actually beat trump, and actually lead us into the future. The future that works for all of us. I will be able to die knowing future generations will have a good life not just exist, if at all. (That’s why we fight.) 

Now, the DNC and establishment media have basically dismissed Andrew. But we have so many ways to get Andrew to the people today. This has to be our #1 goal. I have seen some pretty surprising things over the years. President Andrew Yang is not impossible. Andrew Yang has lit a fire. (You know how fire spreads?) He’s introduced passion to some for the first time in their lives. Do you know how exciting this is for me? We can move mountains. Send people into space. People! We can get Andrew Yang elected President! Anything is possible. 

So, Jinnyjuice, I know all you needed was a yes or no. (The answer is of course, yes.) But this had to be said. I would do anything (Meatloaf playing) to help fan the flames. This is the only fire that should be burning in the world. The fire of passion for a bright, truly Great America that leads the world. Includes all people. Allowing us to live happy, healthy, prosperous lives. Andrew lit the fire. It’s up to us to unite and let it “Burn, baby, burn”!

Andrew Yang 46th President of the United States! Anything is possible."
