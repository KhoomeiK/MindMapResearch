UnresolvedMysteries,fc9joqw,t3_egqmn4,1577553665.0,"I was just in Nikko over the summer-- her poster is everywhere around town. It's *very very very* rural there. I get a very bad vibe from locals, like they resent the many foreign tourists passing through. One of them even yelled at me 'go away' when I stopped to look at his shop. It's possible someone hurt her and disposed of her in a wooded area.

Edit: Japan is not as safe as everyone says... I was robbed at my one hostel and another time a random man followed me back to my share house and tried to grab me."
