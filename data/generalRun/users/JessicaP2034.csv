Last night I consisted of the gym, the pub, dinner at 9.30 and home made cocktails for no reason other than it was friday night and we wanted then. Then I had an early night and boyfriend stayed up playing online until about 2am.

At least once a week we will be halfway though doing something and one of us will say ""can you imagine how shit this would be if we had kids"""

Rant: I had to stop running after 20 minutes, take a 1 minute break then run for the last 10 minutes. I couldn't do the usual 30 minutes non stop. But I'm a little out of practice now, and I'm getting over a bad chest cough, so trying not to be too hard on myself.

Further rant: I saved 600 calories today for a huge dinner of spicy noodle vegetable stir fry. It was delicious and worth waiting for, but I do now feel  bit sick."

vegetarian,fdaaa1h,t3_ekfgr4,1578243599.0,"You might find it easier to start off with meals that are naturally veggie rather than lots of fake meat products, for example baked potatoes, curries, stir fries, mac and cheese etc are all super easy to do vegetarian and you dont have to include any meat replacements if you dont want to. I think they have their place but personally if I rely to heavily on fake meats, I also feel sluggish and tired. And they do get expensive if you eat them every day."

vegan,fcsm9b6,t3_eiimmr,1577919550.0,"Me too! I'm already vegetarian and my boyfriend has a milk allergy so we barely have dairy as it is, thought veganuary wouldn't be too hard.

Breakfast was oats with maple syrup and a chopped banana; lunch was a bowl of watermelon, half an apple cinnamon larabar and two oat milk coffes; dinner was a grilled cheese sandwich with a red pepper dip I made followed by two small oranges and some vegan chocolate ice cream. I definitely could have had a healthier day, but I found it so easy to do.

Tomorrow I've got more oats, coffee, a tomato basil soup, a spinach smoothie, a banana, oranges and pasta. 

I'm trying to find lots of naturally vegan things to eat so I dont rely too heavily on pre packaged stuff.  Hopefully this has given you some ideas!"

I've never heard of it, but this was the first time I've used the nail dehydrator and the first time I've had gels last longer than a week, so I guess it must be a thing?"
childfree,fcnlr5i,t1_fcmvcej,1577813925.0,"I have the same problem, I never get my nails done. I get maybe a week at max because the gel just grows off. But my sister did my gel nails a few weeks ago and used a nail dehydrator because apparently my ""oily nail beds"" cause the gel to slide off. I've had the same gels on for nearly three weeks now and barely a small chip on then, so maybe there is something to it?"

Take it from someone who is a product of one parent having kids despite not wanting them, in order to make their partner happy. I'm 26 and I don't think there has ever been a point where I don't feel like a total burden to one parent. Please, please don't do it."

She did look quite hurt but like....I told you many times I dont want to feel it? Up until that point, I didnt tell her it grossed me out because I didnt want to hurt her feelings, but come on. On what planet is it acceptable to do that?"

childfree,fchzzuy,t1_fchqat9,1577656127.0,"Luckily the UK doesn't seem to be particularly religious so I don't think people are as militantly anti abortion here- far fewer people use religious beliefs to justify their stupid opinions, as far as I can tell.  It's almost like they have no real basis for their opinions and just hate women!"
childfree,fcg0dq8,t1_fccdafx,1577635366.0,"That's crazy- I take it for granted being in the UK. abortions and birth control are mostly free on the NHS (some people have to pay £9ish a month for prescriptions, but that doesn't seem bad compared to some of the horror stories about medication I've seen from the US.)

Edit: sorry I meant £9 per prescription, not per month. I think you get a few months supply with one prescription of the pill. I got the implant a few years ago, replaced 3 years later and will be replaced again next year I think - no charge on the NHS"
childfree,fcarpjj,t3_egwl81,1577575312.0,"""No one wants to get pregnant just to get an abortion."" This is exactly right yet so many people dont agree. I've lost count of the amount of times I've seen ""women use abortions as a form of birth control"" like.....no women do that. 
Genuinely there are people out there who think that we dont use any contraception, get pregnant, ""oh whoops time for an abortion lol"" rinse and repeat. Blows my mind that anyone believes this.

Luckily these people seem to be online only, I've 
 never encountered one in real life."

Additional rave: I threw away a box of cakes! It was a pack of 5 fruitcake slices with icing, 160 cals per slice. I took a bite from one and it was awful, so dry and flavourless. Boyfriend agreed so we just threw them out, instead of eating them anyway like I usually do. (I didnt have anyone to give them to and they were open so couldn't put into the food bank.)

Rant: I posted a few weeks ago that I hadn't lost a single pound in a month. It has now been 2 months (since I started couch to 5k) and still, not a single pound. I've been stuck at 165 for months!
