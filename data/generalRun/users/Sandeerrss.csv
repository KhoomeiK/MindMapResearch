educationalgifs,ffz5y0a,t3_evc3x9,1580365046.0,"Lots of horror stories out here. I had a root canal with a post build-up today. Always had bad teeth so I've been in and out of the dentist for a few years. Todays experience was by far the most nervous I've been, nothing crazy just always nervous and the endodontist was fantastic. I'm trying to take better care of my teeth but bad habits are bad habits. I encourage you to at least brush before before bed, so that the bad stuff on your teeth doesn't sit around on them at night. I will be going back for a crown as soon as I can afford anything that isn't the root canal. You've got this!"
