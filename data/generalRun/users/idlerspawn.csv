todayilearned,ffasrpx,t1_ffaso7n,1579743642.0,Ah his trainer used a time stone to evolve him into a grandpa.
todayilearned,ffaqurs,t1_ffam0rn,1579742355.0,"Not a Catholic- My interpretation of that is different though. It wasn't holy and legal because I like it, it was him resisting fanaticism by actually looking at the merits of something instead of rejecting it for being alien. It was him saying that God loves more than just the things that are familiar to you. 

Also it wasn't just the church that has done some historically pretty awful things. The world is better today than at any other time in history. If we are all only our worst and not our best that doesn't give us much hope."

pics,fe43nmm,t1_fe42hcq,1578855496.0,"So in Manbij the entire bomb squad was Arab, they worked indirectly for the Kurdish ypg, but it was a civil police force there. We captured a bunch of people with ties to ISIS, not with the bomb squad that was a civil force, but it was after the fall of the caliphate and most of the hardliners had already pushed out to other areas. They were really good at using gear in novel ways to overcome some of their short comings. It's hard for me to go deeper than that without putting them at risk. Jan 16th attacks happened while I was there and the city really rallied around us to let us know they appreciated us. Pictures of US forces went up next to their martyrs. Was really cool to see they thought of us as one of them. Made seeing us abandon the area to Russia really heartbreaking."

todayilearned,fcxf5xm,t1_fcxepza,1578061322.0,Great minds think alike. Posted my comment and went to new and found the competing studios movie that releases within two weeks of mine.
todayilearned,fcxf0lx,t3_ejbczw,1578061205.0,Idea for a movie the gay son of a terrorist moves to Paris so he can be with his gay lover but still make his Dad proud by poisoning the French president during his adventure he falls in love with baking and abandons his terrorist goal. Al Baguette coming Fall of 2020.
