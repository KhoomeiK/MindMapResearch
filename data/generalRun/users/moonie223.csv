That fits with the soft top up, the depth and height exactly match the space available with the seats all the way back, and it's about as wide as the seat is, so you could easily fit two. If you turn it 90 degrees you can lower the top still. 

It's also either the exact same or a direct replica of the alpine SBR-S8-4. If you buy a 8"" alpine sub it fits perfect and sounds great and is tuned for about 30hz. The bare sub can be found for ~$60 on sale every now and then, but all day long for $100. Not a bad deal for $165 bucks.

Shallow subs always sound like ass. A small full sized ported 8"" is the only real way to get good sound in a miata, and this is the cheapest way I've found."

Miata,fd6b4s2,t3_ek4tpo,1578188280.0,"Why?

It depends, anything can be made to run. 

But from what little I know, 95 was a changeover year, there are early 95's wired completely different than late 95's. If you have a late ECU, I think you need a crank position sensor as well as a coil pack. You would then need to swap connectors over and splice into the wiring to adapt the late model stuff to work. 

So I'd go back to why, because it's probably easier to fix whatever else you are dealing with instead."

Regardless if you think it's necessary or not, it's clearly required by your buyers for your clearly premium asking price. 

Finally, just so you know, the factory service manual recommends timing belt at 60K miles. The only place it is higher is California, and that is because of bullshit laws. Arguing that people on the internet made it longer is completely and totally irrelevant. You are closer to double the recommended service interval. 

If you think you'll break the thing doing maintenance that just confirms my suspicion that you're way out your league. Probably don't want to mention that shit to buyers.

The remote thermostat reroute kits are terrible. I don't even think anyone makes that style anymore, so they all function pretty much exactly the same. 

I have the q-max setup this go-around. I only have one complaint, and that's the bleed notch near the thermostat is too large. My car used to be fully warm in no time at all. After q-max, I often don't even reach operating temp before I get to work, fucking frustrating. 

https://revlimiter.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/DSC_3399.jpg

With that oversized cutout that bypasses the thermostat it will take 30+ minutes of idling to actually reach operating temperature. 

I've found if you've got a street driven car (IE: Winter!) you must have a 1/8"" or smaller air bleed port and preferably with a jiggler like a stock thermostat. Here soon I am going to remove and seal the notch with RTV, then drill a small 1/8 or 1/16"" hole in the thermostat flange."
