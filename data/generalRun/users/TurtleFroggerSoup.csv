JUSTNOMIL,ffwl93m,t1_ffwgxv3,1580304524.0,"Oh, stop being nitpicky. It's ok to misunderstand people but don't just blame everyone but yourself cause you misunderstood. There is no need to be rude about it."
Offensivejokes,ffwendn,t3_evbe66,1580298100.0,This is the offensive version of a minion meme.
JUSTNOMIL,ffwdd2k,t1_ffwd6rf,1580296487.0,"Not the way I see it.
In this instance it's basically a ""beware"".
Didn't even seem to be directed exclusively at you the way I read it."
JUSTNOMIL,ffwczip,t3_ev9j8x,1580295981.0,"Your SO sounds like a catch.
No FOG detected, only husband material."
JUSTNOMIL,ffvrkwu,t1_ffuxo59,1580271269.0,I second this. No animal should be subjected to living with her. Not even a goldfish.
ADHD,ffvlqgt,t1_ffur6yh,1580267092.0,"That missing people thing... wow. I just thought I was an asshole or somewhat of a loner.
I was abroad for half a year and despite being close to my family and loving the heck out of them... I didn't miss anyone, I found calls with family somewhat annoying.
I love spending time with family but it's like I feel no need to see them on a regular basis.
I love my boyfriend but I can't say I really miss him if he's away for a week or something even though I know he misses me. I feel the time rushes by so quickly that only at night when I'm struggling to fall asleep would I miss his presence."
ADHD,ffvk0sh,t3_ev9loh,1580265933.0,"Being almost impossible to wake up, commonly turning into rage (my mom stopped waking me up for school by the time I was 11 or 12 because sleepy me would cuss her out for disrupting my sleep and not even remember it). Also requiring more hours of sleep than the average person to feel rested and taking forever to fall asleep unless I am absolutely exhausted.
Crying easily out of anger or being upset, now as an adult I feel like I cannot act professional even though I have somewhat mastered hiding some of it when it happens and acting like I didn't cry in the bathroom just now."
JUSTNOMIL,ffvhzel,t1_ffu4syn,1580264558.0,I guess those boomers had to make it themselves
JUSTNOMIL,ffvguhk,t1_ffvez5y,1580263801.0,"I'm sure it wasn't meant in the way you took it.
The person, assumming a large part (bigger than any other) of the people here are American, which is true, made a statement relevant to the US.
Now, of course this is US-centric and sometimes gets annoying to those of us who are not American but there is no need for aggression."
facepalm,fftkbzy,t1_fftf5aq,1580222789.0,"Because comments could be deleted by then.
If you meant screenshots, I think this is more professional tbh."
