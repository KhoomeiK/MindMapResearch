Stellaris,ffel3d9,t1_ffe16en,1579852595.0,Can you remember the names of any of those mods you mentioned.
Stellaris,ffcvrj0,t1_ffcu67h,1579808281.0,"No it’s a generic insult towards machine empires.. The diplo dialogue accounts for certain civics (like police state) and for having a colossus, probably some other stuff, but this is just emergent storytelling"
transformation,ff4djv8,t1_ff430x8,1579561068.0,"Because it’s hot. 

If you don’t have a specific fetish you’ll probably never understand the appeal. I love stuff like hypnosis, and identity death, but I have no idea how people can enjoy feet. To be fair I don’t even know why I like it so much, I just... do."
truetf2,fej8kr5,t1_feiol7g,1579161549.0,"That’s where the ambush part comes in, isn’t it?"
truetf2,feihi8i,t1_feiex93,1579138657.0,"Honestly the fact that afterburn exists negates your ability to run away from him.

As long as he can get a solid burst on you, you still have a pretty good chance of taking severe damage or dying even if you escape."
unpopularopinion,fei2cho,t1_fehruan,1579128749.0,You’re disgusting
streetsofrogue,feermx5,t1_feeevfy,1579039737.0,Total times you have died across all your runs I believe
greentext,fe6spsi,t1_fe6sevb,1578903605.0,"Well its a very good read, thank you for making your comment, it took a long time, I can tell."
greentext,fe6saa0,t1_fe6ojvq,1578903022.0,Lmao he’s never going to respond to you. Well done on showing him the real facts!
streetsofrogue,fe53xud,t1_fe4yyea,1578865452.0,Innocents? You mean acceptable casualties right?
streetsofrogue,fe4pog8,t1_fe4p1eo,1578861645.0,"It's just what I heard, so I made sure to go above 5 just in case."
streetsofrogue,fe4on15,t1_fe4o5q9,1578861423.0,"One more thing, I've heard that if you want a guaranteed win electability needs to be +5 otherwise you only get a chance of winning."
streetsofrogue,fe4nqyy,t1_fe4jr35,1578861200.0,"I've found that the best way to raise electability is to follow these steps:

* When you're in the park you should kill cannibals to raise electability as NPCs who start hostile raise electability when you kill them even though they don't detract from the base -5 electability.
* You only need to raise electability to +1 for each floor which will then add +1 to the city electability, doing anymore after that is a waste of time and may end up making other people mad.
* Take Friend of the Common Folk as it can give you a handy boost to your electability as the start of a floor
* Characters of your same class give you better votes so try not to kill your brothers-in-arms
* Try to bribe bouncers, offer motivation to office drones, buy rounds for people in bars and free prisoners and slaves as each improvement raises electability on the floor.
* Mobsters can be paid off to raise city electability by 2 for 500$ or if you're aligned with them through playing mobster or taking Friend of the Family only 350$

Don't forget to kill anyone who you make hostile or annoyed as they lower electability: taking disturbing facial expressions is a poor choice if you want to win the election."
HighQualityReloads,fdui4qk,t1_fdu8sb5,1578733374.0,"No thanks. ARMA is an extremely slow paced game, and not every game can have ARMA like gunplay if you want it to be fast."
transformation,fdu7owd,t3_emttm4,1578729021.0,"Inkling, for sure"
todayilearned,fdnlmmm,t1_fdnhi04,1578588372.0,"He said in 80 years time, then you say you’d rather live to 90"
todayilearned,fdmngch,t1_fdmnc45,1578556765.0,So you’re 10 years old right now?
casualiama,fdlh0v0,t3_elzkal,1578523836.0,"So would you say you look more feminine or that you look more male? Or is it a mix of both, like a butch woman or a effeminate man?

It’s certainly very interesting. I’m guess you identify as a girl, so would you ever want surgery to remove your penis? And how would you feel about dating? Would you ever consider dating anyone or would you feel weird about dating due to the dual wield you have going on?

Sorry for the load of questions, like I said it’s very interesting to hear about."
todayilearned,fdg7ww2,t1_fdg6er9,1578383761.0,TF2?
tifu,fde0b3y,t3_ekuxcs,1578328272.0,"this story is based off a classic greentext, so its probably fake"
SovietWomble,fcin68c,t1_fchyyh3,1577665374.0,"It’s good, I appreciate the more traditional format compared to some of your newer stuff. Personally I believe this format is a little more re-watchable compared to the others. I find I tend to rewatch a CS:GO video over something like the We Were Here video."
CallMeCarson,fc0lmvg,t3_efh6u6,1577293892.0,That’s really gross.
AccidentalRacism,fbxfn3z,t1_fbxe7wg,1577184938.0,Read the username people
