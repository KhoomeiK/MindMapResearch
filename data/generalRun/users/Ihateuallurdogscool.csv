VanLife,ff63szk,t3_erupkr,1579618428.0,I tore everything out and used it in n trade for an RV. But that was a few years ago now
VanLife,ff638au,t1_ff5ig0t,1579618016.0,"Ive seen those toilets and I'd still rather drive to a gas station than use one of those in a van. As far as wiping people off the planet, but I'm game! Maybe this time something that will take more people out."
VanLife,ff4vzuj,t3_erigun,1579573776.0,When I first read this I was disgusted thinking you were going to talk about how to shit properly in your van. Really glad you're against it. That's nasty. I'm not getting shit particles all over my van cause I'm too lady to go inside somewhere or dig a hole. Just sayin

dogs,few1kco,t3_eqohkm,1579404167.0,"You know those cheese crackers packs that come 6 to a package? My dog ate most of a box of them. She threw up an entire package unopened. Shit packages for a couple days. All was well. In her defense, she just got diagnosed with Cushing's for sure. So she will do whatever it takes to get to anything food like. I have lost backpacks that she saw me put a snack in one time a month ago."

AskReddit,felvsin,t3_epp36x,1579232175.0,Its too sad to think about. I highly doubt I'll ever have $1500 to spend on my arts and crafts. I'm using my birthday to make adult coloring books as is

vagabond,fegvnqr,t3_eozv1z,1579103562.0,I am in the same spot. Only settled down to take care of my dog. She's old and can't even travel rv style anymore. But I hate it. I hate where my life is. How it feels. Where I see myself in 5 years if it stays this way. I can't take it
Showerthoughts,fe62szs,t3_enmvre,1578880506.0,"Maybe. I was born in 1989 and ended up with measles really bad. I have it to my grandma so she took care of me. I apparently almost died, but I have no memory of it"

AskReddit,fdqgqyh,t3_emri7p,1578666260.0,"I would give them Williams Syndrome. It's why dogs love so much. Williams syndrome—a condition in which there’s a surplus of oxytocin, a.k.a. the love hormone. As a result, some humans with Williams syndrome can’t help but love everyone."

Showerthoughts,fdmep0a,t3_em1hhi,1578547442.0,"I think it's because there is a conclusion at the end of episodes. So you're not having to wait 3 hours for it to resolve. Yes some things are on going, but there is always something that gets fixed/solved/figured out/ended at the end of an episode. (Just guessing)"

offmychest,fdeg02n,t3_ekuf7y,1578338210.0,I completely agree. What can we do to help? I don't have much but have been tracking what's going on. It's breaking my heart and I feel powerless. So what is something you know I could do to help?

Dreadlocks,fcwf5zq,t3_ej87np,1578024053.0,"Embrace the wild. This is my favorite stage. It's so beautiful. Once they lock and and are fully formed you will look back and miss it sometimes. Don't get embarrassed, you look fantastic"
gaming,fcwesox,t3_ej3ulk,1578023791.0,"When I started dating my boyfriend, he would leave me to play magic with his friends. So I had him teach me so I could be involved. (I now am the proud owner of 3 decks). Recently a friend decided we needed to play a dnd type game. It's been so much fun. I am not the nerdiest but I'm enjoying the adventure."

offmychest,fcpaddv,t1_fcoiy5g,1577856045.0,Thank you so much. I got her at the roughest point in my life. Then we backpacked and traveled all over the country. She is my soulmate. I even tell my boyfriend she comes before him and always will. I have thousands of pictures of her. I can't imagine my life without her. I've been working so much to pay to have her longer. I'll go into debt to have her an extra minute

dogs,fc6iudq,t3_egbn40,1577481615.0,My dog means the world to me. She has a bunch of issues going on that at costing an arm and a leg. I'm looking into loans and even moving so I can use my deposit. Just because she is old doesn't mean I should give up. She is the best. I will live in a cardboard box if it means my dog stays healthy.
HumansBeingBros,fc5ioti,t1_fc5i583,1577458673.0,Thank you. It's been over a decade. It still hurts but at least I can breath now
HumansBeingBros,fc5il74,t1_fc5i25e,1577458594.0,It's been 12 years. It's easier but movies or clips with soldiers in it tear my apart. Doesn't help his picture is hanging at Walmart in my hometown so anytime I have to go there I see him. It hurts.
HumansBeingBros,fc5hoz7,t1_fc5doeu,1577457894.0,It wasn't a parent but my high school sweetheart died over seas. It hurt so good to see videos of people coming back to their loved ones

TwoXChromosomes,fbz459e,t3_eezw0g,1577234516.0,I agree. I had a hysterectomy at 28. After 4 miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy. I can't stand being told I'm broken. I'm not broken. I am actually fixed and healthier than I was beforehand.
