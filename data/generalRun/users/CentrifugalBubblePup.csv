Especially helps after a workout to clear your mind and just physically feel better. Worth trying to see if it helps you, good luck!"

From what others have said it can take a few months (like up to 6) before they calm down. It’s actually been the hardest part of quitting for me because mine are mostly nightmare type stuff and it’s made sleeping difficult. I’m hoping I start having some positive or at least neutral dreams soon. Hang in there!"
Eugene,ffdpkmr,t1_ffcm627,1579825921.0,"I don’t think teachers are hated at all, quite the opposite. They aren’t paid enough, but most people are very supportive and speak highly of those who choose teaching as a profession. Thank you for your efforts!"

leaves,ff7i4ye,t3_es318x,1579650094.0,"I quit 3 weeks ago and I live with a SO who still smokes regularly. All I can say is that when YOU are ready it won’t matter. I knew for myself I needed to quit and that was enough. I have asked that they don’t smoke around me and that hasn’t been an issue, but for me even though I know it’s there I haven’t wanted to do it. It’s different for everyone, but even after a few days you will (hopefully) feel an improvement and want to maintain that. I guess the flip side is I tried to quit several times before but always gave in after a day or so. I really believe it’s more of a mindset than anything else. I also live in a fully legal state, so even if my SO didn’t smoke I could still get it anytime I wanted. When you’re ready it doesn’t matter if it’s there, for me I just don’t want to anymore, but that was a place I had to come to on my own. Good luck!"
EstrangedAdultChild,ff7fqo6,t3_es10fs,1579648512.0,"Get a cheap pay-as-you-go phone and cancel the one they have the number for. Insurance is tricker, I’m assuming it’s heath coverage, but you can get something on your own or go without if they cut it off. You’re an adult and don’t owe them anything, the sooner you start an independent life the better. It’s been over 15 years for me and it gets easier with time, but don’t answer his call and cut contact for the time being. If you want to reconnect later that’s up to you, but don’t let them make you feel bad for being your own person. Good luck!"
