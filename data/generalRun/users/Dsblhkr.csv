happycowgifs,ffcwkby,t1_ffcablq,1579808765.0,"I learned after eating at a ranchers house that I ate Buster a beloved hippy cow as I called them. I just thought it was regular hamburger. 
So I would say there’s no difference in taste. 

I also had “Kentucky fried chicken” with feathers in it. Asked my friend where all the chickens were the next day because there suddenly weren’t any. Still didn’t eat Kentucky fried chicken for years because I thought they had feathers in their food. 

Grew up in a small town with a lot of ranchers. It was normal to eat their animals for dinner. Didn’t realize the chicken one until I was a teenager and my brain put it together, they just laughed at how long it took me."

Handicapped,ff9iqmr,t3_es0je5,1579713877.0,Not fun at all. I always try to go before I am desperate because I know I will always have to wait for my stall. Most seem to use it for pooping so it takes even longer. It’s really frustrating but it’s not something that’s going to change unfortunately.
Kitting,ff9g6j0,t3_es90aj,1579712321.0,I’m so sorry for your loss.

PCTClassof2020,ff57kzq,t3_d489ji,1579582555.0,"I want to do Oregon only but I want to do it so I end up ending that section in cascade locks for hiker days. August 14-16. 

I’m disabled and want to do the whole trail, but I don’t know that I will ever be a thru hiker. 

I would love to try to meetup once you start. 

You already have to have been signed up to do the full trail right?"
