It'll just be foreplay/dirty talk etc. Takes all the pressure off your dick and allows y'all to explore your developing dynamic to see if you wanna add your dick next time, if there is a next time. 

Added Benny's: experienced couples should totally understand and newer couples may appreciate the 'dipping the toes in the water' approach as they discover how this works for them when it's IRL rather than just a hot fantasy."

Veterinary,ffp2uyj,t1_ffol8h0,1580085116.0,"I worked with one assistant who was amazing!  so much of getting our job done hinges on the holder and their restraint technique. 

Amazing girl could hold anything *(that didn't require sedation, we didn't hold down dogs like that)* and often to the point that I felt chill doin IVC in front of owners for euthanasia's. 

Worst girl literally let the dog knock her over-despite being in a corner with him- three times while I was just trying to get a HWT or something equally benign. (And this was NOT the first time it happened, it was after about three months of her ignoring folks trying to teach her better methods of restraint.)"
Veterinary,ffp2f3s,t3_eudl53,1580084808.0,"Assistants are awesome and such an important part of the team! Without them I couldn't do my job efficiently (tech) which then frees the doctors up to do their specific stuff (paperwork). A good assistant is a god send, and too many people (assistants included) really don't value them and their role enough! 

For me, good assistants are ones who are able to work efficiently, communicate honestly, and predict needs. You'll pick up the skills the clinic needs as you go, don't be afraid to ask questions, and try not to take technical feedback personally. 

Also, good thoughts for everyone: we all get stressed and not everyone handles that gracefully all the time, if we all try to be nice and cut each other some slack, and not be afraid to admit when we fail and apologize, we could have a slightly better workspace."

Although I suppose it's a super fair statement since most likely an astronomical amount of adult women have been abused or harassed by the time they reach adulthood."
AskReddit,ffj7jlk,t1_ffi8arg,1579992353.0,This is the best comment in the thread. Thank you for sharing. I love it.
truechildfree,ffgkyhx,t1_ffefwy6,1579908631.0,"Exactly! Present me is super OK with fucking over future me if that's the case. 

Past me has been awesome enough to future me, I got some karma in the bank lol"
childfree,ffff4wo,t1_fffdejj,1579882607.0,"My one cat LOVES walks. The main difference though is he walks us so we kinda just meander. I've heard of cats who do walk like traditional dogs or follow their people around like that. 

My cats also always want to be in my lap or arms. They're so snuggly and in my business. It's sweet, but at the same time, I kinda wanted cats who were a little more cat ...

So it really depends. If you adopt an adult cat then you can find one with the personality you're looking for (family cat, snuggle bug, aloof, mouser, etc). Kittens are a crapshoot."
