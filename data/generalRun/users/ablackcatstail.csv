It's unfortunate that some folks choose to be derisive to others wanting support, especially because we don't know what that person's circumstances are.

I am a guy that's long decided to be childfree but more for reasons that it would be irresponsible for me to do so because I suffer from mental illness. Despite a degree, I live in poverty. Raising a child in poverty is no way for a child to be raised. A child needs to be raised in a stable, low stress, relatively well-to-do home where its needs can be looked after for 25+ years. Living in poverty is living in constant state of instability and stress."

I put under wanting children maybe and sometimes even put yes and it was because I was thinking more along the lines of wanting a relationship and being sick of the single life. I put the lines that I thought were most likely to catch the eye of a single woman. Lesson learned: Don't start out a potential relationship with a lie.

But I did this in my younger years, 20s. In my 30s and now 40s I am simply honest and adamant. I don't want children and I don't want a partner with young children. If they have grown, adult children that's fine."
