SuicideWatch,ffiqsb7,t3_etuzcf,1579980388.0,Hey. What's going on?
depression,ffiqozt,t3_etuv8t,1579980323.0,"You're not faking it. You have the right to feel, and the way you feel is valid to you. If you're struggling, then you're struggling, no matter what others say.

Just because she doesn't understand it doesn't mean you're faking it. If she doesn't get it or wouldn't try to understand don't share it with her, especially if she's threatening to kick you out."
SuicideWatch,ffipj85,t3_etuvgd,1579979510.0,"Hey.

I'm very very sorry to hear how your mom is behaving. It's not normal and not proper at all.

I'd say don't try to talk to her or bring stuff to her, it might put you in uncomfortable situations, just leave her be. Try to focus on your relationship with your grandma instead.

Maybe try and get closer to your friends and spend some more time with them rather than at home with your mom.

What she says to you isn't true, you're not stupid, not ungrateful, and not disgusting. She has a problem and it's really sad she's taking it out on you instead.

If you're really close with your grandma you should tell her too to try not to get in fights with your mom and not let her take it out on you two like that. When she tries to argue you both should just give her a bunch of ""ok"" and ""yeah"" and not give her a chance to pick a fight.

I know it's rough because she's your own mother, but if that's how she's treating you, you should avoid talking to her when you can.

In a few years when you're an adult you wouldn't have to deal with it so hang in there a little more, you'll have a lot to look forward to. You deserve to and will have a peaceful life later on."
SuicideWatch,feis7ee,t3_epdkzy,1579145862.0,"They already took enough energy and caused you enough pain, don't give them more. 

YOU know how stupid they are. You know and that matters. Instead of picturing their faces, picture how proud you'll be of yourself if regardless of all the struggle you're going to push through, show them all you're better and mainly show yourself.

Don't be harsh on yourself, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with your genes. Don't let how other people treat you or what other people say effect how you feel about yourself. 

Anything that's going on in your life, as long as you're still around there's always a chance for things to improve."
SuicideWatch,feioc3p,t1_feiml8g,1579143215.0,"You're not denying help. I know, it's very complicated. 

I really wish there was a way I could actually help out and not just give small advice. 

I know others might say get child protection services involved but I have no idea how that would work or if that would help you, it might make things more complicated. Also not sure why the therapist you went to didn't mention or think of that, or at least tried to help you with what to do.

This is all very unfair on you. I know you just want to be well and happy, I'm really really sorry. It might not be possible right now, but in the future you might have more chances."
SuicideWatch,feim55z,t3_epcpjr,1579141757.0,"Hey.

You have no reason to be scared, you're talking to your psychiatrist about these things to try and find solutions and ways to make things work out better for you. It's okay. 

You're not a bad person, and I'm sure you've never done anything to hurt anyone on purpose even if you were a little self-centered sometimes. 

The fact you actually listen to them and consider all this and feel sort of bad about it, shows you have a lot of hope and that you might not be as bad as you might think. 

You should do as they told you and try to accept yourself more. I'm sure a few more talks and advice from them will help you figure things out, and help you make things better for you. Don't worry."
SuicideWatch,feile45,t1_feijxb9,1579141245.0,"You don't see that therapist anymore? Or any other therapist? What did he do when you told him about your parents? 

That's really bad of them :/ I'm really sorry.

Try not to show any reaction when they yell at you. It might make them feel like it's not working on you and make them stop a little.

You should really try to see if there's any other family member you can at least hang out more at so you don't have to deal with them as much."
SuicideWatch,feijb5y,t3_epc82d,1579139843.0,"Hey.

Online friends still count as friends. They are real people behind the screen.

Though if you want more face-to-face friends, I'm sure you can make some slowly.

I'm really sorry to hear your parents are treating you that way. It's not right. Do you have any other family members that can help you? An aunt or a grandparent that might let you stay a little while with them?

If not, please try to minimize whatever contact you have with your parents. Stay physically away from them when possible. Don't talk to them unless you have to.

I know it sounds like bad advice and it's hard to do because they're your own parents, but if they are hurting you and threatening you, you should try to stay away.

Are you getting any help with the issues you've been having? You really need to find someone who can give you some support. Maybe through a school counselor or so.

Please don't try anything with pills. They usually don't work. You might cause more damage to yourself, and you're already in pain..

I know it's been really bad for you, and I'm really sorry things are like this. Don't let the way your parents treat you effect how you see yourself, they are not right and they have a problem, not you."
SuicideWatch,feiia1i,t3_epbkc4,1579139164.0,"Hey.

I know it can be very rough. I'm very sorry that you've gone through so much, it's really sad to hear.

You've already suffered and gone through so much, please don't put yourself through more and take a risk of getting hurt.

It might be a little tiring sometimes for your partner to deal with all this, but I'm sure he does love you and wants to help. It might make him feel a little tired because he might feel like he can't really help you when he sees you still struggling.

I'm sure that if you tell him and make sure he realizes he means a lot to you and how you feel about him, and how helpful it is for you that he's there, it would make him feel a lot better and might help you both out.

I'm sure you'll make an impact on a new friend sometime. It's just hard sometimes to find people that we get along with. It doesn't mean it won't happen. Don't let that discourage you yet.

You're not a burden. You're not disturbing anyone. You're doing your best and it's okay. You shouldn't bottle things in, letting it out helps, even if by venting here.

I might not be able to answer your question about life, because I'm still a little unsure myself, but I do know that as long as you're around you have a chance to at least find comfort in things (your partner's company for example) and a chance to have things improve little by little.

I know it's really hard, and I know you're been through so much, so I'm sorry for being a little rude, but I believe you deserve to give yourself a chance to stick around and one day get a little better or at least more comfortable. And maybe do a few things you always wanted to do and never had the chance to yet in life."
SuicideWatch,feign3x,t3_epbk9j,1579138081.0,"The fact that she called you to tell you how she feels, shows she trusts you and feels close to you. 

So I'm sure that even if you ask her all these questions that seem annoying, it helps her see that you care about her. 

I'd say bring up professional help again sometime and tell her she can't know if it'll help or not until she tries, telling someone what's wrong that might be able to help might be worth a shot. 

Spending time with her doing anything is a good idea too. It's good that you keep her busy with games and activities she does with you.

Though checking up on her often is really nice of you, and does help even if it doesn't seem so, she'll need to get some help so she doesn't end up hurting herself, and that you don't get to carry all the burden on you."
SuicideWatch,fehq9r0,t3_ep7gzo,1579121724.0,"Hey.

Your friends don't actually sound much like friends. You're not exaggerating and you're not faking. What you're feeling is what you're feeling, and if they won't hear you out, the problem is them and not you.

About your crush, her mom being mean about it isn't something you should mind. If she wants to be around you - that's all that should matter. You should tell her how you feel and see what she says, if you two are close.

You might regret if you don't. Worst case she'll reject you, but at least then you can move on and try to find someone who would feel the same about you.

You're not bothering anyone, and you should tell people close to you how you feel. It what they should be there for, and I'm sure you'd do the same for them. If your friends don't act like friends though, you should not waste energy on them and find others.

I know making new friends or talking to new people can be scary and overwhelming but it usually goes away after you first try to. 

As long as you're around, you still have a chance to have what you want. I'm not really one to believe in happiness, but you might get close to that someday too."

depression,fdynbkz,t3_ene8a9,1578781654.0,"Hey.

Depression is really hard to deal with, if venting helps you it's okay to do. It doesn't count as whining and it's okay for you to type it out. 

I know it's hard to find motivation when depression gets you feeling down like this, but try not to give up on yourself easily. Let yourself have a shower and you'll feel much better. Try and take some time for yourself to relax and maybe do something you like.

You don't have to have a 'normal' or a 'usual' kind of life, but do try and make yourself more comfy or at least do more of things that you know would make you feel a bit better. 

It really is exhausting sometimes, but you're not hopeless, and I hope you do get a little better really soon."
lonely,fdkazbt,t3_elpetb,1578500046.0,"Different people have different tastes, and different ideas about what counts as good looking. Some might be attracted to you, while others won't be.

Sure you'll be treated better by people who are attracted to you, but if you let negative emotions and negative ways of thinking effect you too much, it might show and it might even drive these people away. Some parts of behavior can effect attractiveness too, not just looks.

Rejection does hurt, and when people don't like you that does give a hit. I know it's easy to say but you should try not to let that discourage you. It's rough and it takes some time but I'm sure every person has a type of people they can get along with, and you might even find one (or a bunch) that like your looks and your personality.

You shouldn't compare yourself to others in any case. Each person is different, and has different things to deal with."
lonely,fdevfuz,t3_el07m0,1578347425.0,"I know, it's tough.

I'm sure one day you'll meet someone who will make you feel cared for, and it might feel natural for you to say it and feel it towards them."
depression,fdesdp9,t3_el0dpa,1578345610.0,"Hey.

Your parents are being very unfair, and cruel, in the way they're using all this against you. It's a very low tactic to get control over you, and it sounds like they got your sister effected as well.

What you need to do is ignore them when they say these things. You know very well that you can't possibly cause their health to get worse simply because you're struggling as well or just because you left the house for a moment. So don't let them convince you of that anymore.

Doesn't sound like you can go to them with anything anyway, so I would suggest you find a few friends that you can trust, and would understand you, to talk to about any issue you struggle with. Or even better if you can get a school counselor to help out a little bit.

I know it's easier said than done, but you should practice from now letting the things they say go over your head. Don't take it to heart. When they try to guilt you, just say a simple ""ok"" and go on like nothing has been said.

I know it's your parents so it's rough, but what they are doing is not fair at all, and they are not right. You will NOT cause them any health problems no matter what you do, these are there because of their body issues not because of you, and you shouldn't feel like you would effect that if you do something they simply don't agree with.

Also try not to lash out on them. They will probably use that against you as well. Just try your best not to listen to their guilt trips and they'll see it's not working anymore."
lonely,fdeq98z,t3_eky2be,1578344351.0,"Comparing to others is never fair or proper. Different people deal with things differently, have different things they want or need, and are in different positions. 

Just because others have it worse (and some have it better too) doesn't mean you should be feeling bad or get called selfish, because you're not. 

I'm very sorry to hear your own family is treating you that way. It's not fair of them. They are not right, you are not selfish, and you don't deserve them being aggressive towards you for speaking your mind. 

Being sad and lonely is completely okay to feel, though you should try and find people you can actually interact with better and who wouldn't treat you unfairly. 

I'm sure you'll find your purpose somehow, someday, but you shouldn't pressure yourself so much about it. I'm sure you have time to decide what to do, for now you can focus on your mental well being."
depression,fdepdi8,t3_ekzyhw,1578343833.0,"Hey.

You really shouldn't feel guilty no matter how you feel, your feelings are your own and you have the right to feel whatever it is that you're feeling.

Doesn't sound like you're dramatizing anything, but it does sound like you have some inner pain you're not sure how to process. Hurting yourself usually only helps a little bit and very shortly, but in the long run it can make you feel a lot of negative things and cause damage to your body.

You shouldn't be so hard on yourself. You're not a bad person. I'm sure you don't have a reason to think that way about yourself.

If you're drawn to suicidal people and feel like you need help too, that might be because you are suffering as well, and you should talk to someone about it and find out what has been bothering you regardless of others.

By talking to someone I mean so that they can actually try to help. Not by being locked up or by you being gone. But by getting you help for your own personal issues and needs.

You shouldn't compare yourself to anyone in any case, every person is different, and every person goes through different things in different ways. Just because someone acts or feels a certain way about something, doesn't mean that you're wrong or not really in pain if you don't go through that the same way as they do.

Sorry if some of the things I said came out wrong or rude. I didn't mean to."
lonely,fd5882t,t3_ek2pss,1578175105.0,"Hey. 

In my opinion what you should be doing is let yourself feel what you're feeling, go through the whole thing one last time, cry about it and then slowly let yourself move on. She's gone and you can't really do anything other than move forward. 

I don't know exactly what happened between you two, but I'm sure that she wasn't as perfect as you try to remember her. 

Regardless though, you will find someone who will actually stick around and will probably be better for you. Don't let something that's already over hold you down."
SuicideWatch,fcwaa8d,t3_ej8wx2,1578020759.0,"Bullies are ugly types of people, they only bully others to feel better about themselves. Nothing they say to you is true, and the problem is them and never you.

I know having aspergers can make things challenging, but it's still very much possible to make friends and connect with the right kind of people.

I don't think you should be using drugs as a way to cope. They usually cause more harm than good in the long run, and being dependent on those makes things difficult. But that's just my personal view.

Being attractive is subjective, and a lot of different people like different things in looks. Girls can be also attracted to different kind of personality and behaviors. You just haven't found someone who is a good match for you yet, it doesn't mean you're unattractive.

Your dad saying these kind of things to you is cruel. I know it's rough, and it's probably hard to ignore since he's your dad after all, but if he admits to trying to annoy you on purpose, try and pay less attention to what he says.

As long as you're around there's always a chance for things to change. I don't mean to sound cliche but you never know what might happen. But it does take some time, and some effort from you.

I'm sure you can stop using drugs slowly, but eventually completely, if you try. It's also very possible for you to meet and make new friends, maybe people who will appreciate you better.

And I might just be a hopeless romantic saying this, but there are so many kinds of people out there, I'm sure there's a girl out there you'd get along well with. You just have to stick around until you find her.

Sorry if you weren't really asking for advice, or if I said anything that came out a little rude."
SuicideWatch,fcw93bz,t3_ej8xvh,1578019968.0,"Hey.

I know this is a very hard situation, for both of you, and I'm sure you tried to convince your friend to stick with you. But I personally think you should keep trying to get through to them until they get back to talking to you.

You two understand each other's struggles and need each other, it won't be selfish of you to try and get them back. They would need you too, to feel better.

Try your best in convincing them to not kick you out, and if possible convince them to not attempt hurting themselves. Sounds like they're already going through a lot, and they might end up causing themselves just more pain.

Recovering does take some time and effort and it can be very tiring, but it is possible."
SuicideWatch,fcw8nrj,t3_ej8p1t,1578019675.0,"Hey.

How does his aunt treat him? What about his parents, are they not in the picture?

You should advise him to try an minimize contact with his aunt, as hard as it may be, so that he doesn't get targeted so often by her. Tell him not to talk to her unless in cases he has to.

I'm not sure how abusive she is, so I'm assuming it's bad and advising these things.

The other important things that you can do are letting him know you care about him and that you're there for him. Tell him he can count and you and if possible try and get him to open up to you.

It means a lot to a person who struggles, having someone to talk to. If he tells you how he feels bad about himself try and reassure him, if he says he's planning to hurt himself try and tell him that it would only cause him more pain and that it'll be better for him if he doesn't.

If he really is suicidal and depressed, try and see if he can ask anyone for help, anyone else not his aunt. If no other family member is around for him, maybe the school counselor."
SuicideWatch,fctkjwe,t1_fctk9bq,1577946617.0,"I used to get that feeling a lot with friends I had before. I felt lonely without them, but then with them I felt really annoyed and couldn't wait to get away. Figured it would be best to use the effort in making new friends that I'll get along better with. 

Sure that might take some effort and some time, but it will be worth it at the end. Don't stay with friends who make you feel bad. Even if you're lonely. 

Try not to replace them with bad habits, rather, replace them with new people. I'm sure you can make new friends on your own, it'll take some effort but you can do it."
SuicideWatch,fcthyqb,t3_eitt7l,1577943897.0,"Hey.

You've seen what drinking problems can cause. I know it's tempting to try and use it to try and distract yourself, but in the long run and even soon after, it'll just make things more difficult and worse for you, and will just add another problem for you to suffer with. May even cause your body damage and that will make it more difficult.

Self harm is pretty much the same. It will just make you feel worse at the end, and will leave scars on you. It helps maybe for a very very short while, but in the end just adds more suffering and you're already going through enough. Try not to put more on yourself to deal with.

Your feelings DO matter, and you're allowed to have and show them. Just like anybody and everybody else.

If your current friends get annoyed at you or ignore you, they might not truly be friends. You'll find better people to hang around with, and ones that would really care for you."
depression,fcqxh61,t1_fcqlvkg,1577893693.0,"Yeah some people are cruel and it's a disadvantage while dealing with them. But with friends and close people who actually care it's a great thing, especially if the other person is too.

Most things are curable or at least manageable, it does take some work and time though. 

The fact that they're getting paid to talk to you doesn't mean it can't work. It might not work with a few types of therapists, they're just human, you might need to keep searching for one who would actually work better with you. 

I'm not sure what happened between you and that person who lied to you, but you shouldn't let that bring you down. If they've treated you badly before, you should forget them, and find other people to hang around with. I'm sure you can find someone better.

You have no reason to feel guilty. You have every right to feel any way you do. Your feelings are yours and you're allowed to feel anything, even if it's a negative feeling. 

It's understandable you'd start hating her if she has been treating you badly. 

I might not know the whole situation, or about her, but when someone abusive plays nice for a while it's mostly to try and keep you guessing and to get back closer to them so they can keep the cycle going and hurt you again. 

It's also very understandable that even though what she's done to you, you still try to have faith in her, because she's your own mother after all. It really makes me sad she treats you badly, I don't get parents who treat their own children bad and even more when they abuse them.

I wouldn't blame you for staying away and not believing her, and if she's still abusive to you, I'd even suggest you keep back from her as much as you can, for the sake of your mental health. You didn't mention your age but I'm assuming you're 'stuck' with her for now so I'm not sure how possible it is, but try and keep interactions with her to the minimum. Don't stay around her physically when you don't have to.

Don't worry so much about her, and don't try to understand her logic. Think about and focus more on yourself, because it doesn't seem like she's doing well in worrying for you."
SuicideWatch,fca6njr,t1_fca67zy,1577563841.0,"Telling you that he doesn't have feelings for you anymore after what seems to be an argument between you two. Implying that he had feelings for you before and just because you made him unhappy they are gone.

I think that's mean of him to say like that, even if I don't know the full details."
SuicideWatch,fca42e1,t1_fca1yeq,1577562771.0,"That's a bit mean of him to say it like that.

It's rough but give yourself some break for now. Move on slowly. You'll eventually find someone who will have true feelings for you and care for you properly.

Try not to spend more energy worrying about that guy."
depression,fca1lzc,t1_fca11hz,1577561616.0,"Ah, I'm sorry. On a second look I worded things a bit weird. I meant about divorcing, not about you doing anything wrong. 

I wasn't sure if you two officially divorced yet or not, so I was saying you should if you haven't already, so you can put the whole thing with her behind you.

I didn't mean to imply you did anything bad, it just seems you two didn't fit together. 

I know after 6 years it's really rough but I think it's important to do so you can fully move on. Because she seems to already emotionally move on, which I don't want to be rude and comment about."
SuicideWatch,fca14wp,t1_fca0hpq,1577561334.0,"You're not crazy. You have feelings and it's okay. 

You probably should have made sure how he feels about you before you allowed yourself to get too attached, so it wouldn't have hurt you that much. I know it's easier said than done, so sorry, but still.

Though if he didn't feel the same about you maybe it's for the best. You deserve someone who will care for you and feel the same about you."
SuicideWatch,fca097o,t1_fc9ziro,1577560867.0,"Why would you say that? I'm sure you haven't done anything that would be that bad. What happened? 

Even after really bad stuff though, which I'm sure it wasn't that bad still, people can forgive later as a bit of time passes.

And I'm sure he doesn't hate you. You being together with him, he probably developed strong feelings for you. That's hard to just shake off like that, even if he's hurt for a little while."
SuicideWatch,fc9zxnf,t3_egu54b,1577560730.0,"She was probably just trying to remind you about things that you might still want to stick around for. Even if it was a weird attempt, I'm sure she didn't mean anything wrong. 

You can always try to speak to someone else when you call later. But you can stick around and chat here. 

Don't just think of your loved ones, think about yourself too. You might end up hurting yourself and suffering more if you do something like that. 

You deserve to give yourself a chance to feel better. Give yourself a little more of a break. Some time to breathe. 

Sorry if it came out a little silly from me, but I don't know what you've been through. Want to tell us here?"
SuicideWatch,fc9z1c9,t3_egujft,1577560336.0,"Pretty bad way to go, if it ever works, and it usually doesn't. You'll just cause yourself damage. 

Probably not what you'd want to hear but feels like I should also add, as someone who researched these for a long long while almost all my teen years;

There isn't a painless or an easy way. There's always a big, annoying chance, that you'll cause yourself more suffering or damage and that will make life harder for you. 

You're already through a lot, please try not to put yourself through more."
SuicideWatch,fc9ymts,t3_egudm0,1577560165.0,"Hey. 

You're not a bad person. 

I know breakups are hard, especially after a long time of being alone, but if you're gone you lose any chance of getting back together or ever finding someone else.  

What happened between you two? Maybe venting or talking about it will make you feel a tiny bit better?"
depression,fc9tuiv,t3_egu9ek,1577558137.0,It's very good advice. Slow steps. It works great for me too.
depression,fc9tp63,t3_egu49e,1577558077.0,"You shouldn't stop caring. It's humane to care. But what you should do is choose better who you care for. If you keep getting hurt by the same person maybe they're not worth your energy. 

You're not dumb for having faith in them, but you did give them chances, and they showed you what they're worth. Now you could choose to spend less energy and emotions on them and move on to people who will actually appreciate it and do the same for you."
SuicideWatch,fc9t4fk,t3_egtsqk,1577557822.0,"People who insult or look down on you because of your age are people with problems themselves. You're not the problem and there's nothing wrong with being 14. They have an issue.

I'm sure you haven't done anything wrong at all. Don't be so hard on yourself.

People of that type, always look for a way to insult or get to you regardless and will always find something to bug you about. Don't mind them, stay back from them, and focus on yourself.

It's only a matter of a few years anyway, until you're an actual, legal adult. So you're okay don't worry."
SuicideWatch,fc9smuz,t1_fc9seft,1577557611.0,"If your friends told you that they're not friends. People who only stick around when you're 'fun' or good to them aren't friends and just use you. 

I'm sure you can make better friends and meet people who will actually care for you. Don't stick with people who just use you. You're worth much more than that."
depression,fc9s5st,t3_egtkah,1577557404.0,"Hey.

I'm very very sorry for your loss, and I'm sorry to hear you've been through so much. 

You're not a burden on your mother, I'm sure she's happy to have your around again and since you mentioned she also divorced she must have been a little lonely as well. So don't worry much about that. 

About friends, I play mostly on PC, so it might be different. But I'm sure there's some online games or games where you usually team up with others where you can maybe find a new group to play with or new friends to at least interact with for a bit to keep busy.

Sounds like your relationship with your wife wasn't the best and she put you through a lot of trouble. So it might be for the best for you that you finally separated. You deserve someone who will care for you better. 

If she's already falling for somebody else maybe it's best you two divorce and fully go separate ways, so you can move on from her, if you haven't already. (I've never been married though, so I might not have a valid or proper opinion about this).

Therapy can help out, it's nice having someone to talk to about everything. It takes some time so don't give up on that yet."
SuicideWatch,fc9er1q,t3_egsq3s,1577551568.0,"You shouldn't be worried, that's what friends are for. I'm sure you'd do the same for them and listen to them when they're in need."
SuicideWatch,fc9eb3c,t3_egskqj,1577551364.0,"It could be from the ibuprofen, it can cause stomach problems I think, from what I've checked and read before (I don't know for sure though) and it could also be because of all the throwing up. 

Drinking a bit of water every once in a while is good (don't drink too much at once now though). When you were at the hospital did you tell them what you took? 

If your pain gets worse you should go to the hospital again, but I think you would be fine, because you probably threw up most of it. 

I only tried with paracetamol before, and I threw up most of it after a few hours too and I was fine. But still pay attention to how you're feeling over time and if it doesn't get better go get checked again. 

And please, pills usually don't work, and only cause damage and more pain. Don't do that to yourself, you're already suffering enough. You deserve some break."
