1 Intense feeling of fear, shock, or disgust.
2 A bad or mischievous person especially a child.

It's about a guy going crazy and murdering people. I'd say it's way more horror than Jurassic sequels/ World anyway.

The100,fem03jr,t3_emm2sa,1579235504.0,"I've watched the first season and 5 episodes of the second. Spoilers ahead. My impression is the people on this are all crazy and the writer's are crazier. First thing Lincoln definitely looks way to old to be going after Octavia. Not sure who decided that was a good idea.

Pretty much anything can happen whenever it's convenient. People need to go to earth sure put all the important ones in the same ship that might just explode. Matter fact Sure he can ride a missile on down no problem. Surgery to remove a bullet from a spine sure she can walk in a day maybe. People seem to just turn their morals on a dime. Oh Finn's the good guy nah just kidding he's a cold blooded murderer and Murphy who was the murderer is suddenly cool. They're falling in deep love in like a day of knowing someone and willing to go to the end of the earth murdering everyone for that person. I guess it's kind of accurate to kids.

Dracula,fe9genx,t1_fe8rv8q,1578937292.0,Yeah the Harker was cool too. Taking out interesting people for him to play off of was the biggest problem on the last ep. They tried to throw Renfield in but didn't really do anything with him and the club girl didn't have a good dynamic with him.
Dracula,fe6mp80,t3_enyozu,1578896189.0,"I mean dude was 500+ they could do a story from the past but it'd probably just be more of what went on on the ship. Dracula killing a bunch of people who have no hope considering they made it a point that Agatha was the only one who was any match for him.

I guess they adapted his old behaviour to the modern world appropriately but the transition to him having an apartment wasn't written well."
Dracula,fe6lzeu,t3_ely9qw,1578895413.0,"I watched this with my brother and the big draw for us was the dialogue. The back and forth with Agatha and Dracula and the banter in ep 2 was pretty good. My brother had to leave when they got Dracula in the box. Later I told him he pretty much saw the good end no rush to watch the rest.

Dracula shooting the random swat member was a weird arbitrary choice. How could he be let go a free man when he shot her? Zoe wasn't as fun as Agatha and they pushed her out of the spotlight pretty quickly. Seemed like they were setting up for something interesting with the Harker foundation but then Dracula used Skype.

Him interacting with the random woman in her house was interesting and I would have liked more of him learning. Instead he immediately knows everything and decides to spend his time exercising and eating tinder dates. It was interesting to have him be in the current world but he was turned into a teenage boy.

I had a hard time staying focused when it was just the club kids. The boy was completely boring and Dracula and the girl gave me Twilight vibes briefly. The idea of people being able to feel cremation was cool because I've thought about that myself. I was pretty much out of it though during the final scene but them laying on a bed of flames seemed random and nonsensical. I'm willing to go back and watch that part though to see if there was some subtext I missed.

Overall it's like they had the beginnings of something but lost it. Maybe modern Dracula was supposed to be funny but it didn't land well as far as I'm concerned."
tifu,fe5mknk,t1_fe3yk2h,1578871436.0,"Right I kind of hope he was playing up how much he was ignoring her share things with him so that he could get people in the comments to say ""you're not weird you were just watching the game"" but in the end it just makes him look like a bad husband who can't even be hassled to go down memory lane with a grieving wife because fooooootbaaawl."

ItTheMovie,fdmc0vp,t3_eloe1i,1578545149.0,"I'd say Curry does better at messing with the losers and him taunting them was some of the best parts. He comes across more as a person who's just really unhinged but was fun to watch doing his thing. The creepy carnival music is forever implanted in my brain when I see a picture of him. New IT music is completely forgettable. One thing that took me out of it was being able to see Curry put his fangs in, though new Pennywise has some bad CG at times.

Used to Skarsgard now but Initially I didn't like him because it just seemed like they were trying too hard and went a completely different direction from the one I knew. He looks like something some one designed to be evil, acts too weird and the voice is off-putting. Someone described him as something imitating a person and in that regard he does well playing the part."
