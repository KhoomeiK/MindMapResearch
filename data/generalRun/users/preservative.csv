velvethippos,ff4c832,t3_ere491,1579560195.0,Probably listed as that to avoid any prejudice directed against pits. She looks like such a love!
KidsAreFuckingStupid,feylen5,t1_feykz7v,1579447153.0,This is some enlightened centrist nonsense.
dontyouknowwhoiam,feygrja,t1_fexkyze,1579445317.0,"If the dude had been like “oh I worked on that film, hi, my name is blah blah” then yeah, that’s a normal way to join a conversation. Being rude or dismissive to a person who is like “let me tell you what a thing is” without explaining why you’re interrupting or joining is perfectly reasonable. I hate when people who respond to rudeness are derided for being rude, completely ignoring the inappropriateness of the original comment."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,feyepn6,t1_fex7soy,1579444475.0,I disagree. It’s not okay to “hate” a group of people.
ukvisa,fes3b1v,t3_ep3q4l,1579360962.0,"My partner (UK) and i (US) got married in Denmark. We didn’t need a visa, we booked the time a couple weeks in advance, we went for the weekend and it was lovely."
worldpolitics,fengq6p,t1_fen881z,1579284323.0,Thank you
worldpolitics,fengohz,t1_femyg3p,1579284294.0,Sure but the person I was responding to was projecting their idea of a scab onto the immigrant in the comic. Not the idea at all.
politics,femwx2x,t3_epzjzw,1579271747.0,“Beginning.”  We’ve always had a corruption problem and to act like Donald Trump and his administration is the cause and not an effect is fucking frustrating.
worldpolitics,femws2i,t1_femqaxf,1579271644.0,You’ve still missed the point. The cartoon is illustrating xenophobic fearmongering. It has nothing to do with being in a union or not.
worldpolitics,femkk94,t1_fem1emc,1579260216.0,"That’s not the point. The point is the middle guy is protecting his horde by playing on the fear of the guy on the right, not the empathy."
worldpolitics,femkezj,t1_fem77yl,1579260023.0,I think you missed the point of the illustration
worldpolitics,femkaut,t1_femj9ni,1579259869.0,That doesn’t address the points the person you’re replying to made. How are you justifying the exploitation of labor? By making a non sequitur about taxes and charity?
UpliftingNews,fem5rul,t1_fem1041,1579240742.0,I definitely don’t mean to be a dick but did you mean clique?
wholesomebpt,fejv5xg,t1_fejuvve,1579186582.0,I think that’s twisting what she’s saying. She’s not saying that she’s immune from wrongdoing as a result of being a mother. She saying that she uses being a mother as motivation to do right.
wholesomebpt,fejuind,t1_fejqcjy,1579186155.0,"She gets so much shit. People on Reddit talk about how she shouldn’t be lauded at all, but if you look at John McEnroe, it’s played for laughs. Same sport, some might argue more of a temper, yet he gets endorsement deals and acting roles playing on his “bad boy/poor sport” persona. That coupled with the “angry black woman” stereotype make it pretty clear it’s racism/sexism."
wholesomebpt,fejtvy5,t1_fejslaz,1579185740.0,What?

creepy,fehl820,t1_fegwhg2,1579118810.0,"I mean we all know that it doesn’t actually smell like a vagina, right? It was a joke. It smells like regular candle scent. It sounds like a cheeky joke women make but of course everyone on Reddit has to shit on something they aren’t even trying to understand."
politics,fehdh09,t1_fehbg1m,1579114293.0,“Would crash the markets” says the commenter complaining about oversimplification
TheAdventureZone,feh2uo3,t1_fdwv613,1579107992.0,Have you seen this? Cemented how terrible Sherlock was for me - https://youtu.be/LkoGBOs5ecM
TheAdventureZone,feh25u4,t1_feg5bko,1579107576.0,"I’ve been feeling this in the mbmbam show recently too. Maybe he’s stressed and overcompensating but someone needs to tell him to let the other boys have space in the shows. 

I haven’t finished the last three or four mbmbams because it gets on my nerves so much."
aww,fedg8gi,t3_eoigua,1579010690.0,Why would someone think a post of stressed out birds in captivity with a caption talking about “gang war” belongs in r/aww? This is not adorable.
aww,fedfz8z,t1_fedcsdf,1579010488.0,Do you always take your justifications for being a racist from the bird world?
aww,fedfwqf,t1_fed8ej4,1579010431.0,It really is. I can feel the tension and hate the idea of someone being amused enough to film this.

PoliticalHumor,fdo4b93,t1_fdnt1tf,1578598645.0,Thank you. I’m still hesitant to buy into a source from 17 years ago but I appreciate the source.
PoliticalHumor,fdnmapy,t1_fdnkdh7,1578588764.0,What. Is. The. Source. The section you quoted didn’t give numbers or even fully back up your statement. I know (admittedly anecdotally) people who homeschool because of school shootings. They still organize a homeschool sports league and are involved in social activities. You’re cherry picking.

Children’s sleepwear has more strict regulations on what it can be made of, for safety reasons. That’s why non-sleepwear is so bright and garish, and sleepwear is clearly coded as sleepwear - so the manufacturers don’t have to uphold the sleepwear standards across the board. Compare the feel and the look of pajamas with everyday clothes the next time you’re in the children’s section. 

Or listen to the first episode of the podcast Articles of Interest - they go into detail about the history and retail implications of the requirements."
MadeMeSmile,fda4l3o,t1_fda392b,1578241570.0,"... yes? There are very strict regulations governing what can be marketed as sleepwear for children. Why would you risk it, for some internet attention?"
MadeMeSmile,fda0alz,t1_fd9pj7m,1578240229.0,It’s so weird though; the children aren’t saying or reacting positively at all.
MadeMeSmile,fda045g,t1_fd97hc6,1578240148.0,"Yeah I don’t really buy this post in general. It’s weird the parent didn’t have the kid explain what they’re doing, if they were so insistent about it. They look shoehorned in."
MadeMeSmile,fd9iic0,t1_fd960aj,1578233858.0,Not just the smothering but children’s pajamas are required to be flame resistant and self-extinguish if exposed to fire; this post is dangerous on multiple fronts.
AskReddit,fcuoj1g,t3_eixc75,1577985351.0,I posted on r/r4r as a solidarity thing with a friend who was trying and I ended up meeting my now-husband; we live in different countries so I wouldn’t have met him if I’d stuck with the local apps. It’s the best thing I’ve ever done.
LifeProTips,fcsnryn,t1_fcsmxt0,1577920611.0,Me too. The idea of him craving physical interactions broke my heart.
LifeProTips,fcsnp0w,t1_fcsjeyv,1577920552.0,That’s an odd thing for a stranger to guarantee
HumansBeingBros,fcndf5l,t3_ei3nmk,1577809353.0,That crib is super dangerous
knitting,fckr5bk,t1_fckpqcu,1577731401.0,"Ok. I disagree. I think that’s a weak argument and ignores the fact that in theory this post could’ve started a conversation on colonialism and instead people piled on saying it was a waste of time and effort. Plus, this is a knitting term. Trying to have a conversation on colonialism and everyday, tacit, historical allusions to it in this subreddit is tied directly to this subreddit and the stitch in question. I don’t understand why this post spurred such negativity towards this suggestion but I’ve learned my lesson and unsubscribed from r/knitting. Imagine blaming me and this post, trying to raise awareness and be more careful of language, for alienating people and enabling neo Nazis. What a world."

Watching the show, I didn’t expect that song to be so loved and memed and posted about. Fuck me for saying that, though, I guess, since now everyone feels the need to explain pop music to me."
Music,fc2zs4w,t1_fc2z8nz,1577378206.0,"I don’t personally see why it’s so popular and in a fandom as fucking ridiculous as this one, yeah, I’m surprised people are unironically expressing delight at a dumb song."

Music,fc2xz4l,t1_fc2xjq5,1577377003.0,Right. That doesn’t explain why it’s got such a big following though.

menwritingwomen,fbsw39o,t1_fbs4jqj,1577061780.0,What is strawmanning about this? It’s very much the character arc of Black Widow.
