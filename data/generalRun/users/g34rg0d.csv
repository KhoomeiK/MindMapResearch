todayilearned,fgkkwxu,t1_fgkkl14,1580867951.0,Solid response.
todayilearned,fgkjycz,t1_fgkjiq4,1580867310.0,I'd ask you to qualify that statement but it'd be a waste of my time and you'd end up with a headache.

Nice attempt, except I was right and you're not."

todayilearned,fgkfadz,t1_fgkf066,1580864204.0,I rest my case.
todayilearned,fgkevpe,t1_fgkdej4,1580863931.0,Yup and you're full of shit. The ass backward Southern mentality is pervasive throughout.
todayilearned,fgkdazl,t1_fgkd6ue,1580862901.0,Virginia is considered a Southern state on East Coast. You're so full of shit. The Southern mentality is pervasive there. I wouldn't expect you to understand that though.
todayilearned,fgkd271,t1_fgkbm3x,1580862741.0,"I was right! Ahahahaha ""Virginian"". Nailed it. You are indeed a liar."
todayilearned,fgkbbbt,t1_fgk9q9k,1580861593.0,You're actually retarded. That's par the course with you though.

todayilearned,fgk9664,t1_fgk8if0,1580860203.0,"Yup. That's what I thought. Used up euphemisms, a general lack of diversity within your vocabulary, taking offense at being called a liar, considering whore a curse word, and not knowing information most people generally do (which I still don't believe).

You're from the South."
todayilearned,fgk8abt,t1_fgk8475,1580859636.0,"""Cursing at you"", certainly you don't mean calling you a karma whore. I think I'm starting to put together just exactly where you're from."

Just checked your profile. Now I know I'm right about you being a re posting karma whore. ""TIL something everyone knows if they've used Reddit for a year, gimme mah points"".

That or you truly did originate under a rock, which would explain everything."
todayilearned,fgk5fw6,t1_fgk3y9e,1580857882.0,"""Where you come from"", and I'm being ""silently laughed at"". What ass backward place do you originate?"
todayilearned,fgk3978,t1_fgk2xoa,1580856568.0,"And you must live under a rock. That dominated news cycles 5 or so years ago and gets posted regularly. Not to mention you got pretty defensive, rather quickly for someone who isn't lying. 

When I smell a karma whore, I call out said whore."
