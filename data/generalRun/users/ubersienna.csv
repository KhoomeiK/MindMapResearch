What I am curious to know (and expected an outlet like Gizmodo to touch more on instead of being a buzzfeed of tech news), is if there’s a lower threshold to how grainy of a video can the algorithm upscale without destroying its fidelity. 

Thanks for the answers in advance!"

CasualConversation,fgcgpd3,t1_fgcf31r,1580672530.0,"I’m learning things along the way, same as you. One trick that helps me stay sorted is to always remember your SO as an individual in their own right. They’re not stuck with you- they CHOSE to. Takes off a lot of pressure from your head. Then, you don’t have to feel guilty because you didn’t force them into sticking around. But you WILL feel the responsibility for self improvement- same as they chose to stick with you, they can choose to leave you. How do you prevent it? What can you bring to the table that will flourish this relationship? Start with basics- love, honor, respect and trust. Then build it up with good, mature communication. Establish a safe space with your SO where no conversation is judged. But most importantly, and finally, figure out your life ahead- but make sure your plans include your SO being in the picture. A lot of young adults lose sight of what they want to achieve because they don’t have an emotional anchor in their life to pivot to. You do.
