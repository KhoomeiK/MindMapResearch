They pop unbidden into my eyes. As I walk passed a knife, as I'm in the garage and see the beams overhead, when I pass that welding supply place that sells gasses. I have seen myself dead in so many places. Sometimes I'm not even feeling depressive. They come as flashes. I only broke down and attempted once. Luckily my survival brain kicked in and called for help.
Now they're always there, when I drive over a bridge, climb up a ladder, hold something sharp.
They're just kinda a background loop that sometimes gets a little too loud."
depression,fdylwz0,t3_en2qbu,1578781242.0,"I understand. I feel like I'm done. There's just really nothing for me here. But I keep pushing. I keep looking for the light around the bend. It's hard a lot of times and I just want to stay in bed. You can do it. It can be better. I have caught that ray of sunshine on my face occasionally. It was so warm, so clean feeling. You can do it. I might not be able to believe in myself right now but I can believe in you."
depression,fcxvd4u,t3_ejamne,1578071014.0,I usually put on sad music when I feel like this. Then I cry for as long as I need to. Then I put on something else. Silly I know but it works when I need it to
depression,fc5l0cj,t1_fc5c5bb,1577460420.0,"I understand your and other comments thoughts. What good is life if you're your just surviving.
 What's good is getting another opportunity to try. Getting another day to see if anything changes. They'll be long stretches that feel like torture, until you notice, yes somethings changed. You need to put in the work though. I have suffered with depression for near 45 years. I wake up everyday ready to fight to survive. Not just to survive but to effing live. 
I know sometimes it feels like you're just surviving and what's the point. I get that. But you can't give that up. Get up to prove the world wrong. Get up to prove yourself wrong. You're not worthless, you're not a fraud. Do it everyday. Everyday try to learn. Become those things you want. Don't let the monkeys in your head that throw poop around mess up you trying to become more.
I promise, if gets better. It never goes away but it gets better."
depression,fbr6rf6,t3_ee58qm,1577039830.0,"I'm 45 my mother has told lies about me my entire life. Her latest are that she hired a private investigator to find me and that I'm living in a homeless camp in the woods. Which is not true, I live with my wife and kids in a house less then 15 miles from her. What I guess I'm saying is that you can escape it, you can move on from her. You have to be strong just to prove them wrong, then you can do what I did and just walk away from them and never talk to them again if you don't want to. I used that thought  when I was younger too just make it through the days. 
Be strong. We are all stronger then we might think, and while this moment hurts you can do it. I did. I'm still here and I'm thriving. You might not feel it but you got this."
