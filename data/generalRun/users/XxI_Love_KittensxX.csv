abusiveparents,ferv9gz,t3_eqfi0f,1579358665.0,"I have no idea what to say but one things for sure, don't end it. Your cat is going to be left with the bitch of a egg donor so don't end it. You're going with the cat, get someone to talk to or figure out a way to destress like drawing (just a pencil and paper),or writing a book or something. Get the cat uder your name (try to because I don't know legal things and how law works) and get the hell outta there.

 Try to get a small job or do favours for your neighbours every now and then for an extra pound. If you have a friend, ask them to help your cat. Friends are important and have your back unless they're not friends. Take a deep breath.

It's alot trying to juggle all of this, I know but I won't say things I'm not sure are going to happen but give it your best shot. If she's been neglecting/abusing you when you were a kid reach out for help! Friends, like I said before, are the absolute best to come for advice. Good friends will have your back.

 Maybe you could go on r/legaladvice or that one subreddit that helps legal things (I'm unsure if it's that one). The app Calmhalm helps and the app 'Loop' is really destressing and relaxing. 

Take care of yourself since I'm only a online stranger and this is the best of what I can do but I really want to help. Focus on yourslef first before others. I know, sounds selfish but you gotta take care of yourself before trying to handle the weight of others.

Do things that make you happy! Try new things within what you can do and most impotantly, don't give up.

Plan things out and if one day it's too much, take a deep breath and assess everything. You have a lovely cat, you've reached out to the internet (a big step!) and most importantly, you are here!

It's not your fault since things seem to be very stressful for you but alarms help. Calming music soothes my nerves alot so try that. The alarms might help you remember things if you forget so do those alot. You can write a 'To do list' for tomorrow and start ticking it off. Once you've ticked it all off (with breaks inbetween) reward yourself. You've done really good today by going onto the internet and reaching out a bit.

I hope things get better for you and wish I could do more but I suck at doing stuff like this. I hope I managed to get my point across though. De-stressing is very important."

cats,fdz8i7j,t1_fdvbeku,1578787704.0,"This depends. Though 'filling the void' helps, don't do it too quickly. You might have expectations for the oet to be like the old one and it'll hurt you more that they're their own personality. It might also hurt the pet because of the expectations set down for them. It all depends on the person you are though."
cats,fdz843h,t3_en69wh,1578787567.0,"Don't get another pet to 'fill in the void' to quickly. Make sure you've gotten over him if you do because sone people expect the pet to act like the old one and it hurts yourself and the pet. I don't know how to move on but don't bottle the feelings up, they'll just cause a bigger problem in the future. He's not in pain anymore so live your life to the fullest, for him! Life is tough and things like this happen but moving on feels like a weight off your shoulders. Things happen for a reason and he was suffering enough. He's had a good 11 years and a good person taking care of him."

Vent,fdsdm7l,t3_empzse,1578700241.0,I've felt probably a fraction of that feeling and it's not nice. Be safe and don't stress too much over it. Chew some gum or something to distract yourself in the meantime.
