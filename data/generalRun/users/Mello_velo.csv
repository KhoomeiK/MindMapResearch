BabyBumps,fem9fkd,t1_fekw547,1579244682.0,"Honestly, I've had a spinal headache and it fucking sucked. That said I'm still getting an epidural. It's a few days of an excruciating headache if you stand up and don't get a blood patch, but in hospital you're much more likely to get a blood patch asap. Mine I tried to wait out for days until I went in. It sucked, but the chances of me being in a ton of pain during labor are much higher than me needing another blood patch."

BabyBumps,fem8zk7,t1_fek2d7j,1579244171.0,"I understand where you're coming from, but pharmacology that's not really true.

Epidurals are great because other than a short-term drop in hr from the increased ICP there are very few systemic effects. It's a local drug.

Inhaled anesthesia, on the other hand, works because it often is causing systemic effects. Some gases are safer than others and cause less overall changes, but they're still a drug that is being distributed throughout the body. We allow things like NO because it quickly wears off so it basically reverses itself in a small amount of time if something isn't going well."

fitpregnancy,fej9oi8,t3_epd4fi,1579163034.0,"Honestly for me the first trimester was just about survival. Ask your OB if you can start unisom b6, to see if that takes the edge off. 

Pickle juice some folks swear by for nausea. Sour fruits can be helpful. Hard-boiled eggs with salt was a prey easy way for me to get protein. Don't be too hard on yourself if you're diet goes to shit, you'll do better later."
fitpregnancy,fegkbir,t3_enusy7,1579095365.0,"I haven't sailed during my pregnancy, but I did when I was younger. I think there are a few things to be aware of.

First there is the obvious slip and fall potential. This can of course be mitigated by either less aggressive sailing and/or proper footwear. If you don't have a pair of good boat shoes, get some.

I am not sure but when you get further on hiking out might cause some coning. Just pay attention to your stomach and make sure you don't notice anything when you're engaging your core.

If you are on a dinghy and use a trapeze the harness might fit a little weird due to the belly. If it's uncomfortable don't do it.

Those are the main things I can wrack my brain to come up with. My biggest personal concern would be the ocean triggering morning sickness. That's mostly because I had such bad morning sickness that driving in a car was torture. Be aware of your body and don't be afraid to sit things out until your second trimester if it makes you feel ill.

If it doesn't trigger morning sickness though, there's very little you can do the first trimester to physically injure an embryo. If you're not worried about rupturing your bladder, you're gonna be fine."

TrollXChromosomes,fefsw3n,t1_fefs1zn,1579064200.0,I would suggest looking into proheart injections after this is all done. Even one day we're finding can leave a dog open to heartworm infections. It can be hard to keep up on so the injection takes that guesswork out of it.
