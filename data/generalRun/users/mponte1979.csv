On the trip back, after several beers, we found ourselves sitting on the outer deck next to one of those New England “Colonial” bands.  Old timey clothes and everything. They taught us several Sea Shantys, including this one. We sang our hearts out as the sun went down over the water, the ship swaying with the waves. That was a good day."
