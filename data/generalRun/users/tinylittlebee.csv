ADHD,feszg3d,t3_eqf4vr,1579370452.0,"Some people just explain things like this to everyone because they don't know better. I had teachers and also my psychiatrist who do that. I don't know if yours are doing that in a  condescending way because I wasn't there but maybe that was the case and it's not them thinking you are stupid.

I still suggest that if you feel uncomfortable by it you should try to switch psychiatrists, chemistry with a doctor who is treating you is very important because we have to be comfortable enough to tell them symptoms or how we feel about a certain medication or treatment."

raisedbynarcissists,fe6kmwh,t3_enpe96,1578894030.0,"Yes, I feel that what affects me the most is the constant feeling of guilt and thinking that maybe I was actually the one who was ""broken"" to begin with. Also trying to learn what normal is like and fighting with your own mind rejecting it because it's not what you were taught your whole life. 

There is days where I'm hopeless and some where I feel good though, it's hard to put in words. 

I think that we have to be patient with ourselves, it took a long time to build these negative mindsets so it makes sense that it takes a long time to try to undo them."
