When you punch, rotate your hips (this is where the power comes from) and mark your target *through* your opponents face. You don't want to punch their face, your want to punch it through the back of their head. Don't think this will end with one hit. When you get a good one in it'll put them off balance...then you keep hitting until they stop swinging. Hit again and again until they fall, then run. Don't try ANYTHING fancy, you will fail. It's either shit you only see on TV or stuff it takes training to do. **DO NOT BE AFRAID TO RUN IF YOU HAVE TO.** Shit, run to avoid the fight at all if you can. Better to be called a pussy to your back than a dead man. Most fights last a minute at most, so put everything you have into the beginning. This isn't UFC, there are no refs there to save you, if you're going to fight you need to put the other man down and either get out of there or end his ability to fight.  
Edit: Oh, and you're probably going to break your hand or hands. I'd say punch with the two knuckles closer to your body because your wrist and arm structure support them, whereas the bones in the hand supporting the outer two are curved and snap easily, but you won't remember or be able to control your punches well enough anyway. That takes training, and ""out with broken hands"" is a very common MMA injury. Better than being dead, though. And if you're not going to be dead...why the fuck are you fighting?"

There's no evidence he advocated for ethnic cleansing or anything, he ""just"" talked about the inferiority of other races a lot. And I think the benchmark for early twentieth century racists was set around the same time by another guy (side note Lovecraft sort of dug Hitler when he firstt heard about him but became increasingly disillusioned with him later in life even as Madisom Square Gardens was filling up with fascist rallies)

I want to make it clear that I'm not defending Lovecraft here, his views were abominable, but they weren't more extreme than the views of a large segment of the country at the time. We just have a large record of them, combined with a thankfully diversifying SFF fandom who are looking more closely at the lives and views of the group of mostly white dudes who defined the early canon. He did talk about it a lot, though, that's for sure. And for which he should rightfully be judged.

I'm in Florida where it's been very slow going in terms of rolling out a useable medical program so I still go through my friendly neighborhood weed dealer. I get 8ths for $40 (whereas the universal standard is 50 - I have a good relationship with this guy). Nuts that I pay less than some folk who get it legally. This is dispensary-quality shit, too."

He'd basically decide he was gonna get laid, scroll through that app for maybe ten or fifteen minutes discussing the dudes he like was browsing a menu, then head off and get some dick. As a straight dude who had to put in the usual effort even to get a girl's number it was amazing, like watching a billionaire shop on Amazon. Whenever he brought one of the dudes back to the suite he'd still ask for some of my beer, though. On the other hand he'd come back with his gaggle of girlfriends from the club and find a reason to excuse himself while leaving them with me, so in that sense he was the best wingman I ever had."
