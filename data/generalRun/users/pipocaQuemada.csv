In some languages, you can make new semantically incompatible types that are just an int or a long under the hood. 

In F#, you could have `500<population>` that says that the unit is population.  In Scala, you can use a library to say something like `val pop: Int @@ Population = 500`.

In C, you can make something like

Not all ranked methods require a total ordering of the candidates.

Many, like Schulze, admit ties.  So you can vote A > B = C = D > E.  This allows you to bury the hated candidate under all the merely unknown candidates.


> \- Range/Score (no value):  
> It has no point limits so it doesn't respect the value of the voter (which should be the same for everyone).  

Why should everyone have to use the same number of points?  Using more points can make your vote more expressive, but it doesn't make your vote worth more.

For example, you could give A 10 votes, and everyone else 0.  Or you could give A 10 votes, and B, C, & D 3 votes.  Either way, A only gets 10 votes.

This scales really well to wide fields.  You can simultaneously vote 10 Warren, 10 Sanders, 5 Yang, 3 Buttigeig, 0 Biden.  You don't have to hurt Warren to support Sanders, or vice versa.

With your method, you could easily cause Warren or Sanders to lose by flooding the field with similar progressive candidates, splitting the progressive vote.

> Not respecting the value, it generates directly or indirectly tactical votes, especially if the winners are more than 1; you could also give more points to little-known candidates to favor them over hated ones, so there is also a negative vote.

What's wrong with negative votes?

> The tactical vote occurs only if changing the form of the vote, this allows the vote to better represent its true interests, when calculating the results.  

Tactical voting happens when someone can *get a better result* by voting tactically.  For example, a Warren supporter might tactically bury Sanders if it looks like Sanders is going to win.

If it looks like the race is between Warren and Sanders with Sanders winning, why wouldn't a Warren supporter vote Warren 100 with DV?  That would maximize the chance of Warren winning, albeit at the cost of an increased chance of, say, Biden winning instead.

Why is DV less susceptible to tactical voting than, say, STAR?

> **Mathematical criteria**  
> They aren't important in this speech because they only serve to describe a voting method in a more rigorous way but they don't establish in any way the optimality of the vote.  

They show ways that voting systems fail to be good, which is why they're important.  Many systems sound good at first glance, but break in interesting ways when prodded.

> What is your definition of optimal vote?  
Without this definition it's difficult to understand which method is really better than another.

An optimal voting method is one that minimizes the total unhappiness of the result, while scaling well to many viable candidates (for example, it should be able to easily handle a field containing every 2016 Republican primary candidate and every 2020 Democratic primary candidate), and minimizing/eliminating the chance of failures like nonmonotonic results."
