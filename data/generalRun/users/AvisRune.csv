getting_over_it,fejhjxb,t3_epfbuk,1579174550.0,"Timers help me like mentioned above. I am also hopelessly messy and live like a tornado. I’ve been setting 15 minute timers and just pick up the first dish, and keep going from there. Getting started is the hardest part. At the end of the 15 minutes I had a relatively clean kitchen despite feeling overwhelmed at its state before I got started. 

I also hired a cleaning lady last month. It was a HUGE help. For her to do her job, I had to get stuff off the floor. So it was motivation."

mentalhealth,fegem2d,t1_fege7nn,1579090088.0,"There’s no right or wrong way to journal. I struggled with it at first because I had it in my mind that I had to complete at least a full page or two for it to count. It doesn’t work that way. Sometimes my entries are a sentence, sometimes they’re a paragraph, and sometimes they’re three pages long. Anything goes! Any kind of pen goes. You don’t need to doodle (I’m an artist and I don’t doodle in my journal). The beautiful thing about journals is you can make it into what you need it to be. :)"
