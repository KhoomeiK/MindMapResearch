cats,fdwhkpj,t3_en94x0,1578758775.0,"Example of things seen: he was reported at times to be traveling alongside a large wildcat who had befriended him. Before he arrived on our doorstep, he lived in a mountainous, rural area with a less-than-respectable ""owner"", strictly outdoors, after having spent the first 6 years of his life under different ownership: an elderly woman who raised him strictly indoors before passing away. He was worse for the wear after his outdoor years, but we're pretty sure that his wildcat friend kept him safe. He's a very timid and gentle cat. A very special boy.

The 8 year old is mellowing out now, the 7 year old is dealing with teen angst, and our two 2 year old littermates still have all of their kitten energy. I especially can't wait for my 7 year old to get old with me. He's my OG baby, so having brought in the additional 4 under his scrutinizing watch, he's got some jealousies.
