I'm sure there's a lot of fabricated bullshit out there on both sides of any race/gender/sexuality discussion, and there are assholes on both sides too."
facepalm,fexdv24,t1_fexcdhw,1579429365.0,"I don't think anyone was questioning that it happens, just that we already have a word for being condescending. A condescending asshole is a condescending asshole, a sexist asshole is a sexist asshole, and there is a point where these two assholes intersect to create an asshole squared.

Words like mansplain get thrown out at the slightest of things and it diminishes the intended impact. It also doesn't really work against the intended 'target', as it often gets turned around so it's about the woman being emotional, looking for sexism etc. which isn't right but it's the type of people you are dealing with. Calling them out for their actual bullshit and taking age, race, gender out of it lays it squarely at their feet and makes it harder for them to turn around. 

That's my view anyway."
EggsInc,feaft0y,t3_envr3c,1578948170.0,"I think in liue of communication tools in game you should have a status, need, don't need or neutral to indicate if you want tokens. And also an indicator of how many they have, and maybe even what boost they're going for. 

In the waterballon contract I was miles ahead of the rest of my group, but I'd hit an impasse with upgrades and having the most SE I had basically hit the limit of growth. But people kept gifting me tokens, I'd wind up gifting them back or to the rest of the team but an indication of who wanted them would be useful."
EggsInc,feaf1ej,t3_eo9g3v,1578947858.0,"Every SE you earn makes the next one a teeny tiny bit harder, but that resets when you prestige. With each prestige you will earn more money, and the money you earn nets you more SE. So there is no harm in prestiging early and often. Once you get to the later eggs the earning rate skyrockets so making the journey easier is no bad thing."

I can call security/the police and ask them to remove you from the premises. Or you can leave of your own volition with the drink you bought."

worldwarzthegame,fbwmkp7,t1_fbukqc2,1577153873.0,"I agree with you for the most part, having played L4D2 recently it does feel (and look) dated. And while the L4D series has a special place in my heart unless Valve releases a new game, WWZ is my go to. That said there are two areas where L4D still surpasses WWZ.

First is art direction, WWZ has pretty good graphics, but it goes for quite a middle of the road photo realism, L4D on the other hand had a a slightly off realistic style with film grain and other effects to reinforce the movie motif, that created an immediately recognisable look and also informed gameplay. For a start the more night time focused gameplay created a more suspenseful experience, not being sure what was ahead, having to turn off your torch to sneak past the witch, fantastic. WWZ on the other hand is for the most part brightly lit, which is great for spectacle, not so great for suspense, for my money the best level is NY2, the darker environments are more intimidating, and then the big open area is brightly lit for the swarm battles. I will now contradict myself when I talk about the visibility of the specials, Valve made a point of giving them distinctive silhouettes which made them easier to spot and had audible hints too, little musical stings plus the sounds the special themselves made, this all combined to give you a better awareness. WWZ has both distinct designs and sounds for the specials, but they just don't stand out so much, making it sometimes feel unfair when they catch you out.

The second thing is the AI Director which gave L4D a much more dynamic feel, changing weapon spawns, enemies, picking on weakened team members and even altering the level layout slightly in response to how the players were doing added to the aforementioned tension. WWZ is great, but you start to learn the item placements, allowing you to min/max things like breaching charges, and item/weapon placement does feel like a pretty clear progression through the tiers with a bit of RNG thrown in. And while I love the stealth elements that have been added, it would be fun if every now and then the game would trigger something to fuck up my day if I was doing too well.

All this said I still agree WWZ is the best game of it's kind at the moment, I absolutely love the way the zombies literally flow like water with no regard for themselves or those around them, and the increased verticality with the zombies towering up or falling out of the sky really captures the mindless terror of the zombies in a unique way and is possibly the best addition to the zombie genre as a whole. I think the stealth mechanic is a great addition (though with room for improvement), I like having the classes and progression systems for replay and reward."
