Each to their own, it wouldn't be for me, but that's why people have preferences. I never shamed her for it, no one should be. You're right, it's sexist.

relationship_advice,ff6l3y9,t1_ff66y45,1579629509.0,"My SO thinks the same. I'll spare the details but while we were on a few days away I had to borrow a pair from him to sleep in. He acted like Christmas had come early. Its also a really big trope in movies too, and that has to come from somewhere? I mean don't get me wrong everyone has preferences so I understand not everyone will like it.. But OP's boyfriend is being over the top, passive aggressive and manipulative in how he's acting. What an ass."
relationship_advice,ff6k9pf,t1_ff6ilrh,1579628998.0,"I agree. It's more, 'I want it this way, and it doesn't matter that you want x, y, z', so the control would eventually bleed into other areas of the relationship beyond the aspect of 'sexy'. It could be (obviously just providing an example here) that he doesn't want her to hang out with certain friends, go certain places etc in the future.


Also, unrelated, but what you said about your wife was so sweet. You sound like a lovely guy."
