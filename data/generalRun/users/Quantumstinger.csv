The fact is that even the most pessimistic reports, evaluated responsibly, don’t suggest climate change will end human civilization, much less within our lifetimes.

IdiotsNearlyDying,ff2ib3h,t1_fezyxlz,1579507370.0,"That’s not what they’re getting at. Using any illegal drug and just possessing guns is a crime. 
I think it’s a federal one, meant to target crack dealers who shoot people that try to rob them, or cops. 

That’s why people who apply for medical marijuana cards can’t buy guns anymore."

unpopularopinion,ff1xzsv,t3_er1syq,1579488756.0,"Personally, I love it when people say shit like that, or that animals only kill for food.

Loons(the waterfowl) kill their babies if they beg for food too much. 

Male lions kill rivals cubs after taking over a pride. 

Storks and pelicans will drop the weakest baby out of a nest. 

Ducks basically evolved to rape other ducks. 

Even hamsters will kill each other and take the dead ones babies if you put two mothers in a cage together. 

I think it’s meerkats that will eat their young if they get too frightened. 

Animals will eat their dead babies all the time."
