Cows, sheeps, dogs, pigs, chickens,  oranges, peppers, onions, eggplants, thyme, cannabis, yeast... All those species are sure to outlive every other because humans will farm, breed & grow them. They'll exist as long as we do, because we are the new nature, and ""natural selection"" today means ""human selection"".

Lions used to live in Greece, and possibly south France/Italy. But as they were dangerous to cattle and humans, ""nature"" pushed them back, and now there aren't even lions in north Africa.

Avocados evolved to be eaten by giant sloths to poop their seeds elsewhere. When they disappeared, there wasn't any species that would eat the fruit without either leaving the seed under the tree, or destroying the seed. But humans like them, so they took the seeds with them and grew them. Avocados aren't natural, if they were, they would be extinct."

Seriously, constructed decks made from draft chaff and the cards you opened in 10~15 boosters are the most fun you'll have. There are no disparity between power levels, the game is less expensive, you can do 1v1, 2hg, 5 players FFA, even 3-way with teams of 2, and still play with the same decks.

(IMO the amount of refugees comes from the instability and poverty in African countries that isn't getting better as time goes on)

For me, the rise of right wing is a cultural issue. What I see where I'm from is, the children of immigrants will show a strong feeling of nationalism and cultural bond with their ""native"" country (actually the native country of their parents) and will refuse the local culture, despising anything that would associate them with the ""white people"", staying in like minded communities, feeding the cultural clash, further hindering any effort for cultural exchange, as they have a feeling they don't belong in ""the white people's world"", and getting refused because ""they don't want to integrate"".

And the right wing rising is because people see those ""local 'estranged' communities"", are afraid and angered by them and make a link with the recent, over mediatized, waves of refugees, and conclude that those people come here to crush their culture."

But if you're on a refugee ship, get rescued by a European ship, and say ""I don't have papers I try to escape the war in my country"" the ship have no solution but to get you in Europe, as the law states that you can't leave someone in another country if he's not a citizen of it. (Dura lex sed lex)

He's like a cat, that can sleep all the time, eat the same food every day, lazily walk around the house, and still be happy. Except even a home cat has an instinctive need to hunt and kill small animals to be really happy and healthy, even if you don't see it doing it.

Kira says he don't need great joys to be healthy because, as the cat owner don't see his cat killing birds and mouses, Kira don't see his murders when looking at his everyday life, even though they bring him joy, and he needs them more than the rest.

Now that I think about it, he's full of a narcissism that make him think his life is different from everyone else, justifying him killings other people for his well being, like (Jojolion spoilers) >!Jojolion's Kira, who has the same kind of narcissism, with a disdain for the life of others, but instead of seeing other people as his toys, he sees himself as perfect.!<"

facepalm,fgk8i05,t3_eyxu7c,1580859772.0,"I try to grasp the concept, but it's hard. I will go slowly:

I start by defining as ""mature"" someone that can understand the consequence of their actions.

Let's admit someone that isn't conscious of the consequences of what they do shouldn't be let to decide of such a choice. It's stupid, but it's logical.

But the other side is, you should be mature and rational to decide to abort. That means, people that abort, are able to deeply consider the consequences.

Those people, that abort, decided to abort *by themselves*, because if they were not able to decide by themselves, it would mean they are not mature enough, so they should not abort, by the first point.

Now, it's not stupid to say, if someone can have a mature reasoning, they can consider the act of aborting. Or else nobody would abort.

So that means, someone that would **never** abort, on any condition, is just not capable of seeing the logical following of what they do.

Those people, that want to vote this law, are convinced that an abortion is an awful act, and should be performed in no way. So, they are not capable of mature thought.

In conclusion, people not capable of mature thought, want to take a decision for other people, saying ""they're not capable of mature thought""

It needs a great degree of stupidity to avoid the contradiction here."
