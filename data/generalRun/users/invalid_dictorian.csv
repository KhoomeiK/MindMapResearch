taiwan,fffs1zl,t1_ffelsuw,1579890560.0,"Is this the bridge that takes you from Taipei shi to Yonghe?

I think in the mid-80's they added a second bridge next to the older bridge to double the number of lanes crossing the river. I remember thinking to myself (as a kid back then) that that's a lot iron and steel and wondered how they were able to get so much of it to build the bridge.

Also near that area on the river front there's like a large park with a track, and there was bicycle rentals there. I remember my dad taking me there and rented a tandem bike and we rode around the track the whole afternoon. It was the first time on a tandem bike and also was a rare outing since my dad was always working back then. So it was really memorable."

That will cut down on some of the driving, if possible.

- Do you have kids or other responsibilities where you need to be at a certain place at a certain time?

That locks you into a certain schedule (and usually rush hour because others may have similar schedules, especially when it involves kids), which having to commute longer will make it more stressful. But if your schedule is free, then its not an issue.

- Also need a bit of clarification. Is it 20 mile round trip currently and moving to 50 mile round trip. Or is it a 100 mile round trip?

- A higher pay rate can set you up for even higher pay rates for future jobs. Some employers will only pay you a certain amount if you can show them that you already make some other certain amount. (That's illegal in some states though.)"

This is why U.S. Senate and Representatives also needs a term limit. Even Supreme Court judges should have a term limit. Like 18 years, enough time for a career. That will curb corruption and also makes it predictable and fair when presidents can appoint new judges."

YangForPresidentHQ,fecu3j9,t1_feabhvt,1578984668.0,I don't agree. The people at DNC aren't dummies.

YangForPresidentHQ,fecty0z,t1_febffen,1578984494.0,"I very much would like to see DNC split into two parties.

Landlord,fecsnno,t1_fecott7,1578983089.0,"Landlording is a business. If you don't treat it as a business, then you're not doing it correctly. Yes, it totally sucked to have to put money into it for everyone including OP, I'm not gatekeeping on suffering, whatever that even means. ""Suffering"" in this case is measured by the monetary loss and time loss.

And I am speaking from experience. The reason my property got to that state was because I wasn't on top of it at the time. It was my first property. Tenant had kids and asked to stay despite only paying partial rent. I let them stay even though I should've evicted. And issues in the home wasn't raised to me and I didn't check either. So I suffered financially for it.

So I say let this be a lesson on landlording. As others here have mentioned, always be on top of your properties, set up your rules and follow them strictly. Evict on non-payment, following the rules set out in your lease agreement."
