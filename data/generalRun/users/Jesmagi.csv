WTF,ffi57we,t1_ffi0o3k,1579965406.0,What would you suggest him do? If he doesn’t have a yard. What he did was wrong obviously. Does he have a drive way? Where did he get those shrubs from if he doesn’t have a yard? Where does he leave his trash for pick up? I have so many questions lol.
WTF,ffhazn8,t3_etliuc,1579928379.0,God. These always break my heart. It’s almost always a young girl being attacked with acid by her “boyfriend” “fiancé” or “husband”.

Sometimes parents choose to teach their teens, then they just go to the DMV to take the written test and get the license. (From what I remember. It’s been a long time)"

WatchPeopleDieInside,ff60kc6,t3_eru2yh,1579616021.0,Reminds me when I scraped the shit out of my dad’s car while he was teaching me to parallel park. Learning to drive for the first time is intimidating. Take your kids to a big HUGE vacant parking lot. Lol

GetMotivated,ff3uu26,t1_ff3syck,1579549338.0,"I think an employer would rather hire a committed person than someone who got their degree quick and couldn’t keep a steady job. My husband took 7 years to get his, but that’s because he took the job he had very seriously. He would take semesters off, and was offered a high ranking position at his work. He ended up declining, to focus on finishing school, no matter how long it took. On his resume it shows how many years he worked at that place, most employers would see that as a hard working, committed individual."
MadeMeSmile,ff3kwu3,t1_ff3k47m,1579543232.0,I do. I tend to mock her when she starts whining. I make the same sounds she makes and it sounds like a siren. So I go whee woo weeee woo are you a fire truck? And she laughs then gets over it. Lol

iamatotalpieceofshit,ff0sfv1,t1_ff07slr,1579471860.0,I remember watching a video about what happened to him. He started getting into drugs and got his sister into drugs. She overdosed and died. His family basically blamed him for her death. Since then he’s been a huge wreck.

Honestly what pissed me off the most is that driving while crying is extremely dangerous. She could have actually killed YOU in a car accident. I’ve driven while crying, your vision gets very distorted and you can’t focus. 

You are in no way over reacting. I almost cried reading this story thinking about my child possibly dying. She’s soulless. I’m glad your son quickly realized how wrong that was."
