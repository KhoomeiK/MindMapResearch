television,ff82zit,t1_ff7y15f,1579664623.0,">You're not destructively copied into  a stack though. It's a constant ongoing backup of your ego.   


By destructively, I mean that when stack data is transfered, the old media is erased.  All the data on the old stack is destroyed.   

Or should be.     




>It's consistent enough that you would remember the moment of your own death.  

They almost always do.

>Feasibility of this aside. Assuming this could be done as it's described who's to say it isn't your consciousness that's being transfered if you hop into a simulation, and then pop back into your body afterward is your original consciousness gone? 


It is a *copy* of your consciousness.  

You are born with your mind occupying your brain.   
Some time thereafter, your cortical stack is installed.   

Until your first transfer out, your brain is essential to how you experience the inner and outer worlds.     

The slightest change in neurochemistry or structure alters that.  
If you had a neurological disorder (ADHD, Autism Spectrum... whatever), and suddenly the biological basis for it vanished, a very significant part of what makes you *you*, you would not be the same person.   

If you suddenly incurred neurological trauma, and were subject to mood swings, or sensory issues (pain, sensitivity, synaesthesia), or changes in spacial perception, or language ability....  You would have to come to terms with a new definition of *you*.  

If, after resleeving, you reside solely in the stack, the substrate upon which your mind exists is vastly different (unless its software somehow perfectly simulates your old wetware, like some kind of virtual machine/brain).    
How would *my* ADHD change?  My learned behaviour vs. my now ""neurotypical"" stack/brain.





>Or does that even matter.  I physically my body has been replaced several times over.  

Like the ship of Theseus.   
As a child, were you aware of your physical growth as it occured?  Or were you made aware of those changes by external factors?   

Your flow of consciousness changes much more quickly than your brain does (although hormones, neurotransmitters and ""stuff"" us also constantly in flux).   
Although, perhaps your consciousness is not always changing in ways that would seem significant to an outside observer.


>I lose consciousness every night so continuity is not maintained.  

Continuity of consciousness is interrupted by unconsciousness, which also includes neurological activity.  
Whether or not you need to be aware of what occurs under the hood for it to still be ""you"" isn't a question I've heard spoken of, but most people tend to wake up believing they're the same person.    



>Technically all that exists of my consciousness from 5 seconds ago is memory. Would that be different if that memory was backed up then restored into a new body?    

So much of your consciousness, experience of the world, and identity is inextricably tied up with the means through which you experience it and yourself (your body, sensory organs, CNS, brain).   
If you removed your brain from the equation, all future experience and perception would be different from your previous consciousness.  

Memories are a funny business.
Think of an old sharp memory.   You didn't just recall the event.  You recalled the memory as it was the last time you recalled it.   It slowly erodes or changes over time.   

Let's try a less mutable memory, maybe something that still causes a visceral reaction (a trauma, a dangerous event, the worst night of your life...), how much of that physical reaction to that recollection is dependent on *your* particular CNS and brain chemistry?  
If you changed bodies and brains, certain parts of your recall would be altered.   

You start out as a brain.   
Transferring to another stack, and therefore deleting the contents of your old brain, should be death, creating a new... ""life.""   
This new electronic entity that resides on stacks and operates sleeves is something new.   

Resleeving is creating a kind of post human from what you were."
television,ff7mqma,t1_ff7lsoq,1579653254.0,"If I resleeved into an unmodified clone of myself, I *might* be me.   

Even then, my understanding of neuroscience is that it's unlikely.   

Once I'm destructively copied to a stack, the digital human is not me.  
However, going onward, that digital human might continue to exist regardless of resleeving.   

As for the Catholic idea, I'm not sure I agree with them.   
You don't have a soul.  You *are* a soul, what you have is a body.
