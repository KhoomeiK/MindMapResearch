fernie,fgrw2fu,t3_f06f45,1581059769.0,"The information centre on the highway is very useful.  Head for a walk along the river. From Canadian tire to James White is a super nice spot. Snowshoes, fairy creek falls. Same with the provincial park. Or head to the golf course area along the river for different views.  Expect restaurants to be busy, especially the usual places like Nevados, or yamagoya, but since it's the start of the week it may not be too crazy. Himalayan spice bistro does great take out or delivery. I hardy hardly reccomend the vegetarian dishes, better bang fr your money.  I hear the food at the Indian kitchen at Stanford inn is great, service quite atrocious.  The Blue Toque does evening service on the weekend and is fantastic, quiet and not super busy. The pizzas at Loaf are great as is their breakfast.  Big Bang bagels are okay, call and order them before getting there. Best chocolate is at bean pod. Best coffee, hard toss up, blue toque or mugshots. Breakfast at mugshots is basic, but well worth it.  I'd go there for lunch too. Head to the northern on Tuesday for burger and pint. Stay for bingo, trust me. The Fernie is great for pub food as is park place lodge. The legion is great for a quick cheap drink and a game of pool.  The distillery is amazing and their cocktails whilst a bit pricey, they're are so good.  Second Avenue has all the shops, check out the arts co-OP. Polar peek is an amazing bookstore, the libray is super cool inside too. Try to check out the courthouse. The museum is small but it's got some pretty neat stuff.  Coal town goods has some great stuff. Go for a drive down Cokato road, you'll see the valley from a different perspective.  The ski resort also has great snowshoeing trails. Elk chair to boom. Everyone goes to Rusty Edge on the resort. The Griz bar stinks of sweat and beer. And legeds is shit as is the day lodge. Better grab a sixer from the mountain pantry and tail gate it at the parking lot.  Have fun, hopefully there's tons of snow for you."
