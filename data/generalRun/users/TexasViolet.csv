SuicideWatch,ffj5sym,t3_etwy6d,1579991126.0,"Since you said you just started college, I'm assuming you're in your late teens or early 20s. You're young. Just because you haven't found a girlfriend yet doesn't mean you won't. Don't know if you follow tennis, but look at Serena Williams. Incredibly accomplished, rich, intelligent, beautiful--and she didn't find ""the one"" until her mid-30s. Same for her husband. Now they're deliriously happy. They've both said if they'd met 10 years earlier, they would have ignored each other. Give it time. You'll find your significant other, and you'll find what you want to do in life."
work,ff7oaxt,t1_ff7mvgd,1579654350.0,"Depending on where you live, they don't need a valid reason. Texas, for example, is an at-will state, which means you can be fired for any reason. Most companies won't do that because it can cause legal problems, but your company may be petty enough to do it. Check your state to see what legal protections you have.

It sounds like you've decided there's nothing you can do to appease your boss. Again, I don't think a couple of weeks is too long for leave. But you were out over the holidays, when others may have had to miss events to do work you'd normally do. 

Your boss may have also had employees in the past who were out a lot due to child-related issues and may wonder if you're going to start missing a lot of work. As a childless person, I've definitely spent way too much time over the years taking business trips, covering meetings, and working nights and weekends for co-workers who take off often for school activities, sporting events and other things involving their kids. And honestly, they seldom return the favor when I need to be off for a doctor's appointment or family emergency. Maybe you could reassure your boss that you intend to carry your load--but it kind of sounds like you don't want to."
depression,ff7kwf1,t3_es3hgv,1579651981.0,"Um, your friend is plagiarizing by posting blogs already published elsewhere without citing the original source. For example, their first entry was published last year on Very Well MInd. If the website or original author finds out, your friend could get sued.

Your friend is also collecting personal information on an unsecured site without the proper legal context, which could get your friend in serious trouble, depending on what they do with the information. 

FYI, I'm not making this up. I've been a digital writer and editor for more than 20 years."
work,ff7k1w7,t3_erxhs0,1579651391.0,"A perspective from someone who's been on the other end of parental leave: It sucks. I've had to stay late, come in early, give up my plans and increase my stress (and workload) so someone else can take an extended leave. And in my case, when my colleagues returned, they spent a lot of time wandering around showing people pictures of their kid instead of working.

But ... you were entitled to the leave, and good for you for taking it. It was your boss' responsibility, not yours, to make sure your workload was covered while you were out. And to be honest, three weeks is not that long. Unless it was a really busy time of year, it shouldn't have cause that many problems. 

I'd definitely look for a new job, for several reasons. In the meantime, consider going to your boss and ask what you can do to help the team get caught up from your leave. Yeah, I know you don't want to, but if you really want to stay with the company, you need to at least appear to be a team player. You don't want your current boss to sabotage a possible transfer, which it sounds like he could easily do."
SuicideWatch,ff4rd70,t1_ff4ls4x,1579570599.0,"Depends on several factors. If your insurance has to approve your treatment, start working with them now, because it can take a while. See if your employer has an Employee Assistance Program that can help you get in to see a counselor. Try a service like Brightside to see a psychiatrist and get on meds. (I think there's a new one called Cerebral that's free or really inexpensive for the first month.) Check in to online counseling; their wait is usually a couple of days rather than a few weeks. Not sure if any of those options will work for you, just some thoughts ..."

It seems like in the U.S., if your problems can't be solved by meditation or watching a funny movie, you're out of luck.

One of my friends tried to overdose this past summer. Even after an attempt, he was told he had to wait a month to see a counselor and 4-5 months to see a psychiatrist. He has dual citizenship, so he packed up and moved back to his home country, where he got in to see both a counselor and a doctor within a couple of days and is getting better. And I'm jealous."
depression,ff063aj,t3_er1561,1579465609.0,"I hate it when mental health professionals tell me that taking a walk around the block will help my depression. It doesn't. I'm not just sad. I'm not just mad at a friend for not texting me back promptly. I have severe, chronic depression. It's a disease, a chemical imbalance in my brain. I can't pull myself out of it. It sounds like it could be the same for you. Talk to a doctor about antidepressants. Tell them what you've been doing and that none of the activities is helping."

That may help if you've had a fight with your partner over leaving dirty laundry in the bathroom, but for those of us with chronic, debilitating depression, those things are worthless. Stop trivializing depression as something that can be helped by eating a pint of ice cream. Do something to make people take mental illness more seriously. And start with yourself."

I wish women were raised the same way boys are. They don't get the message that their worth lies in getting married and having kids. A single man with a good job is considered successful. A single woman with a good job is considered pathetic. And we women buy in to that. Stop it! No one wants to be alone, but you also shouldn't settle."

If you want to take a semester off, do it. You can always go back. I had to take some time off to work and save money, but I went back and it didn't affect my career. A lot of people take a break. Do whatever is best for you, and to heck with everyone else. Take care of yourself."

My family is that way. I didn't get married at 16 because I had two very strong female high school teachers who encouraged me to go to college. But even now, in my 50s, my relatives still tell me ""it's not too late,"" that I can still get married, and that there's probably an agency somewhere that will give me a baby."

We donate to charities. We have wonderful relationships with others who do see us as humans. (We ignore the ones who don't.) We have fulfilling careers. If we want kids, we can adopt. But we are not defined by how many babies we pop out. An you are not useless. Far from it. You're just beginning.

He said I could tell him anything, good or bad, and he'd be there to listen. He said he'd never tell me what to do (unless I asked him to), but that he'd always help me talk things through. Most importantly, he promised I'd never, ever have to face my depression alone. And I haven't. I've had some very, very bad times, but he's always been there, whether to run errands that I can't make myself do, make me eat, run interference with friends and family when I don't feel like being social, or just holding my hand.

Your family may continue to pressure you, especially if all your relatives are married. I still get hounded to get married and adopt. Stick to your guns. You know what's best for you. Get married when/if you want. Have kids when/if you want. The only way your life will be meaningless is if you don't live it on your terms."

By living at home, he could have done anything he wanted. He didn't have to take a mind-numbing job just to pay the bills. He could have held out for his dream job, or taken a lower-paying job that was more fulfilling than sitting in an office. At the very least, he could help around the house. 

If he and my mother are OK with him living at home not working, not helping, that's their business. It doesn't affect the way I live my life.

If you're afraid you're going to waste your life, do something about it. If you're depressed, get help while you have support.

They threatened to ""beat some sense"" into me because I didn't vote for Trump. I could go on. Personally, I don't care how they live their lives.
