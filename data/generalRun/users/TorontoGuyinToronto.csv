What's your point other than hate, bitch?"
worldnews,ffcmena,t1_ffcl9qu,1579802541.0,"Yeah, that's what they do.

They understand the nuances of their own culture, and understand the heterogeneous nature of the society, and are able to view them as individuals.

Just looking at objective facts, they know that the country has a billion people, and the country is as large as the european continent. Yet, despite this knowledge, they are both unable and unwilling to see and understand that this society is by basis of its size and history, possibly (and is) even more heterogeneous than their own.

But they don't. You know why? Because they take one look at ""these people"",  they see them as aliens. As threats. As alarming. They look at these exotic foreign cultures , especially asian, they dehumanize them. They only see them as copy and pate grey borgs that they can hate. Because that's what their gut feelings tell them.

Everything else is just justifying their own feelings.

It doesn't matter to them. If you understand this about the average white person (I'm not saying everyone, a lot of my family and friends are white, but the average shmuck?), then you will stop trying to convince them. It literally doesn't matter. They'll believe whatever the fuck they want to believe."
worldnews,ffcmcb1,t1_ffclpqs,1579802501.0,"Yeah, exactly. But do you really expect redditors (white edgy teenagers) to actually know what foreign cultures are about before screaming their hate-filled sarcastic rants on reddit?

I don't think so. There's literally nothing you can do to change their minds, because their emotions speak first before their mind does. All their talking points are just verbal justifications of their feelings. They've already made up their minds. It's pretty much the same phenomenon as political bipartisanship. You have to realize humans are not rational beings, and you shouldn't expect them to be.

So frankly, I've given up on them. And you should too for your own sake. It's futile."
worldnews,ffclrby,t1_ffc6v12,1579802152.0,"Nobody cares. White people have their hate boner going on. And nothing can stop it. You can debunk all of their talking points, but they're just going to find some other talking point they're going to hold onto and parrot. 

You have to realize they're not basing these rants off of objective analysis, but based on their emotional feelings towards an entire people. All the other talking points they parrot afterwards is just so they can justify that feeling in a broader society without sounding like some satirical KKK dingbat."
