Cringetopia,fewdfek,t1_few99zu,1579408748.0,"> I can see how pedophilia’s negative connotation down to a certain age  is something modern society made up. 

Society just ""made it up."" Has nothing to do with the fact that we know young children don't yet have the necessary reasoning skills to make a decision on something like wanting to have sex with a 50 year old man.

You think we just ""made up"" that children are too young to gamble, smoke, vote, drink, enter into contracts, etc? Or is it because we understand things better in our modern society than we did hundreds and thousands of years ago?

Also your dumb ass argument that ""Well there are still some countries where kids can get married!"", there are still some parts of the world where slavery is normal, does this mean slavery is okay too?

And finally your argument about what's wrong with normalizing pedophilia? Are you even being serious right now? Some people get sexual gratification out of eating shit, does this mean we should ""normalize"" it? Maybe see it play out in a movie sometimes? Learn about it in school? Shut the fuck up."

If you are covered via your employer then your pre-existing conditions were already covered.

Most states already had laws in place that dealt with pre-existing conditions.

The idea that no one had pre-existing conditions covered is absolute bullshit and the insurance companies don't give a shit because most people had insurance through their employer which again covered pre-existing conditions.

Why do you people continue to lie about this?"

Bullshit. First of all they are doing this because if things keep going at the rate they are going then the Japanese people will cease to exist. Of course trends could change at some point in the future to avert the collapse of the Japanese people, but that's why they are saying IF CURRENT TRENDS CONTINUE.

Secondly capitalism can survive a stagnant or even shrinking economy, what are you even talking about? Do you mean like an economy that forever shrinks? Well, yeah, I can't think of anything off the top of my head that can survive if it is continuously shrinking."

If there was a virus that caused people to eat so much they became a 1000 pound lard ass then I would say that's an apt analogy.

Am I saying NO ONE who is a fat ass suffers from a mental illness? No, I never said that. What I am arguing against is this piss poor excuse that EVERYONE who eats themselves to 800 pounds of fat just suffers from a mental illness.
