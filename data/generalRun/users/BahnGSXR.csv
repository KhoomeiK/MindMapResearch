cycling,ffewrlj,t3_elw8v8,1579868694.0,"UPDATE:

I've changed gear cables and sleeves, brake cables, chain, cassette, tyres and inner tubes, and the bike feels amazingly sharp now. Also the new tyres  (Continental DoubleFighter III) are much smoother and softer (bouncy?) than the old ones. The only problem I was not able to solve was the wheel truing. I think the original rim tape (looks like recycled inner tube) is riding up onto the tyre bead seat and blocking the bead from sitting where it would, so the tyre is wobbling about like mad. Also I didn't know how to adjust spokes, so I just tried to straighten the tyres as much as I could and just left it like that.

Maybe I'll have to take the tyres off in the future and then I'll install new tape & true the wheel.
Is it okay to inflate the rear tyre past the maximum of 65psi? It bugles under my heft.

Also is there a name for [these frame clips](http://blob:https://imgur.com/a77691a6-d527-43f9-b767-d19ac5abe023) so that I may buy a pack of spares? I understand it's something cyclists lose often. There's no hole for me to loop a zip tie through, and my temporary fix [looks very inelegant](http://blob:https://imgur.com/96d3e552-2dd1-4f4a-b63d-884ec3b77d4f).

Thank you all again!"
