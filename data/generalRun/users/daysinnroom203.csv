Right now my son is in college, and my daughter will start in two years- I really want to help them get situated before I take out loans for myself- plus- I work 9-5 . I am so tired when I am home - and work is super busy. But I am definitely considering this."
aspergers,ffb2zl0,t1_ffb2rb6,1579750481.0,"I don’t think it is for archives- and it may not be everywhere for library science everywhere either- I live in NY state- and both the schools nearby that offer it, do require that. I’ve looked into a few out of state that also require it. I found some in North Carolina that do not- but I’m far from there. Anyway- good luck- pursue your dreams- but do your homework ahead of time too- make sure you’re on the right path."
aspergers,ffb211t,t3_es0zyt,1579749811.0,Sorry. Be kind to yourself. Ask your wife for some help putting together a resume. Maybe contact a temp agency. So sorry.
aspergers,ffb1uj3,t1_ff81pvj,1579749688.0,You sound - exactly like me. No tech- like the idea of night/ being alone work- but as a small woman- not a great fit. Looking into a masters in library science- but I’m pretty sure you are required to have an undergraduate in education. Mine is not education- and since Im older- my kids are in college- I don’t see how I have the money to do all that. A masters is 50k where I live.

TheCircleUS,ff7l0w0,t3_es14c6,1579652067.0,"Same- about pretty much everything. I knew Shub would play it cool because he’s a politician and he knows it’s going to be on tv. Also he had to maintain that never had more than sister feeling for Rebecca, because otherwise it would feel..... humiliating. So he, they all, played it cool for cameras. He was bummed though- more than he wanted to show. Loved Chris- loved Joey- loved Sammie- I liked Marissa too and was bummed when she got booted over frickin Adam. That.... made me like shooby a little less. It made no sense at all. 
I wanted more wrap up and honesty in the final episode. It felt like it wrapped up too quickly. I needed a few more episodes too."

relationship_advice,ff7cqpr,t3_ertsws,1579646522.0,Is your job to be attractive to him at all times? Is this what it means to be a woman? Depressing. Controlling. I’m sorry. I really hate this. He’s allowed his opinions- he’s allowed to express them- but that whole passive aggressive controlling thing. My ex did the same thing. I exhausted so much time trying to be “ right” for him. Wear your boxers please. Be comfortable.

confession,ff4q24l,t1_ff40veu,1579569701.0,I don’t know- even an apology and a “ nothing actually happened” would make some people get very suspicious. Did he make her write that? In case it came out? Did he coerce her? Did she actually write that or did he? I think it’s best to walk away and not look back.
confession,ff4pvow,t3_erc2dd,1579569576.0,This relationship is over. Sorry. You were a kid then and didn’t realize the implications- but even the whiff of being a child molester is a death sentence- even total fabrication. It is in his best interest to never go near you. The risk could destroy him- even an apology would send questions into people minds. You can’t do it. Drop  it an sleeve this one alone.

memes,feu0lmu,t1_fetoy59,1579381949.0,"You have no idea what is going on in these peoples lives and what they are struggling with that they cannot come forward. Culturally it’s never been acceptable- and on a personal level- you literally have no idea what’s been going on- how many times they spoke to officials that hushed them, clergy that hushed AND threatened them, lawyers that’s said there wasn’t sufficient evidence to file a case. Just because you’re seeing them now, doesn’t mean there haven’t been year and / or decades of attempts being made. Aside of that, shame and fear are mighty motivators, as is lack of funds and support."

memes,fetbfnp,t1_fet1xl8,1579373623.0,"Not sure why that got down voted. Worked in schools/ social services/ foster care for two decades. Women and girls do NOT get support they need, and men are rarely- if ever - brought to any sort of justice. I’ve seen it go that way for decades. You can down vote what
I see on a daily basis- but it remains the truth.  It goes back to when I was 8 and my friend admitted her dad had been molesting her for her whole conscious life, but her mother couldn’t afford the divorce and asked her keep quiet."

Anxietyhelp,fele41o,t3_eps0sq,1579220028.0,There are also therapists on apps- I’ve considered- but never used one. Some mental health clinics will talk to you over the phone- or you can look in the community- perhaps even a social service specifically geared towards pregnant women? Sometimes talking it out helps so much
Anxietyhelp,feldu9h,t3_eps0sq,1579219846.0,"It’s seems like your fear of situation getting out of control is triggering you - I think anxiety is cyclical- it starts as a thought you yourself produced, and then mushrooms into your body producing these hormones and chemicals - and then it becomes a monster you can’t control. You are “ what if- ing” right in this post. You need to stop this thinking. What if you manage this? What if you make it through okay? What if you keep your job?  Calm music- calm thinking- cold water! Seriously- make yourself cold. It will lower your heart rate. If you can’t get in a shower- put your wrists under cold water, put a rag on your neck. If you can - pray or meditate when you get a moment. Breath. 
Wish you the best."
