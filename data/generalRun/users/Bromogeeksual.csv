insaneparents,fh9dcci,t1_fh9cuwc,1581378651.0,"Totally. I did not write my comment clearly. I wasn't trying to add to bi erasure, merely share how my ""bi"" experience was different/opposite as I was always gay but in denial. I edited my comment for clarity and less erasure."
AmItheAsshole,fh9cpkm,t1_fh9bfvv,1581378226.0,Totally forgot what thread I was responding in. Sorry for the overshare and uncomfortable comment. I know that is not the case for the majority of bi people and I don't expect that. On the internet it's easier to share odd thoughts on a whim. Sorry for the fetish-ization of your sexuality!
insaneparents,fh9cccg,t1_fh97c51,1581377985.0,"Lol, no way. Poor guy. I can admit a girl is attractive, but I've always been gay and never had sexual thoughts about women. It wasn't until puberty that it became much more clear to me and I realized I was never bi. All my crushes were popular guys and hot teachers. Somehow it still took a while to admit I was gay though."

AmItheAsshole,fh8xwdw,t1_fh8xl71,1581369624.0,"Not all, but I wonder if there are people in that experience. If they are choosing to be straight, they assume everyone else makes the same choice."

AmItheAsshole,fh8wa2o,t1_fh8joh5,1581368677.0,"Yeah, the logic is super spotty.

I didn't choose to be gay, and sadly when I was younger I would have chosen to be straight to avoid the conflict and heartache I feel daily due to my conservative family. It's not a choice!"

AskMen,fgmyj3j,t1_fgmvh6m,1580934394.0,"Totally agree on the lazy from a comedic perspective too. I just prefer friendships that are more supportive and chill. I don't tease my friends or joke at their expense. Doesn't mean that we can't joke or tease each other like when we do something ridiculous in a board/video game, but I think making fun teasing people for personal things, especially things beyond their control is pretty tasteless and I think it affects people more than they would admit in a group setting. Maybe it's me being gay, because I notice it a ton more with my straight buddies, but not much, if at all with my gay friends.

If I hung with a dude all night and thought they were hot enough to make out with, and we didn't have sex, and I found out later they were trans and were born a female it wouldn't make me less gay and I wouldn't even be upset.

I'm willing to bet, as men often are, he was just as interested in her looks as she was his. He continued to hang and make out with her and only seemed to have an issue when his friends started making fun of him. It's easy to see how an insecure person might back peddle and paint the other non represented party as the sole blame when it was probably mutual if not a non issue. I'm not saying trans people should never disclose their status, but to me that would be in the circumstances where you plan to have full intercourse or pursue a relationship. If it's a casual fling and you both found each other attractive I don't think they are under any obligation to out themselves and potentially put themselves in danger. If he really found her hitting on him a turn off, or two aggressive, he didn't have to make out with her. I've had dudes hit on me that I don't find attractive and end up at the same after party, and guess what. I don't make out or hook up with them there. You guys are trying to put this all on her when he could have just not engaged. Clearly he found her hot enough to make out with."
AmItheAsshole,ffanr06,t1_ffakd5m,1579740268.0,"Of course we have enough information to assume the intention of the trans girl based off a one sided story from a guy who has been peer pressured to feel ashamed and would never embellish the story to make him seem like the victim. So many people out here assuming all trans people are a,bush predators or something. For all we know she de-escalated the sexy times to not put him in an awkward situation. If you were part of one of the most brutalized and murdered demographics in the world you may not be so forthcoming with information, especially when a drunk dude is hitting on you. Obviously he found her attractive and they had a good time. The didn't do it and we only have one side of the story. Trans people are not some super predator trying to get one over on you. They are people trying to live their life and navigate the dangers of a world where many feel they shouldn't exist or should be punished for their mere existence.
