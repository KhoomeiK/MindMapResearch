newzealand,fej4b2j,t1_feiafuy,1579156375.0,I hope she is arrested. I also know people like this and it pisses me off. I know at least 3 people with loans over 100k who've left and plan to never return. My loan is huge and I've been painstakingly working on it for years and will continue until I can no longer work. It's different if you can't repay due illness or inability to work but to have the blatant attitude of well the country owes me this or fuck everyone else I'm out... grrrr
newzealand,fej40qr,t1_feic5x9,1579156068.0,"I can confirm this, having been an overseas borrower for a few years, a few years ago. My loan is very high so I had to pay 5k annually but it could be broken up into 2.5 due in sep and the other 2.5 due in march to make up the 5k. Considering how high my loan is 5k didn't really cover anything but I thought it was very fair of them considering how much I owed back then"

A book 4 would be nice or even a prequel with information on the wars fought prior to book 1. Just don't mess with my book1-book3. They are perfection (bar a couple of eps, but now they have nostalgic value as well)"

aww,fe5l8vx,t1_fe3zqeo,1578870904.0,The frustrating part is that climate change is just a fact and a major factor in these fires. The overwhelming lack of containment well that's 100% on the government. They have whittled the firefighting and fire prevention budgets down to nothing in a country that is prone to fires. I'm not 100% on these facts but as far as I know the government took the job of fire management officers ( a skilled job for someone to come up with plans for containment and planned burning amongst other important things ) from a number of 36 to 10 officers for the entire country- in a country prone to fires- does this make sense? It does not
