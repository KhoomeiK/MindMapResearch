AskReddit,ffg1qac,t1_fffql31,1579896566.0,"Roger Pielke Jr. is not a climate denier. If you actually read the links I provided you, you would find that he is one of the names included as one of the scientists who have gone against the RCP8.5 model. He is an example of a scientist who has gone against the consensus and used actual evidence to show why the RCP6 model is the more likely scenario. This means that future models (the ones being used by the IPCC in the AR6) are now more accurate thanks to scientists like him. 

Richard Lindzen also isn't a climate denier. He agrees that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, calling people who dispute that point ""nutty."" He agrees that the level of it is rising because of human activity and that this should warm the climate. 

https://www.carbonbrief.org/what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-know

His problem is that he believes that uncertainties in models (meaning we don't have the exact numbers but instead ranges) mean that the models can't be trusted overall. Just because we are uncertain about certain numbers, doesn't mean we have to be ignorant about the science overall. 

His main research is that clouds are dampening the impact of climate change so we won't have to worry about it for a while. He has been disproven time

The fact that you listed Patrick Michaels shows that you didn't look into the Baliunas controversy. You know, to get an understanding of what we are even talking about. Unlike Willie Soon who at least tries to use (faulty) science for his claims, Patrick Michaels just outright lies. He's been betting since 1999 that ""the trends will start to get cooler!"", and he's been doing this for a while, despite actual evidence showing why he's wrong. You seem to think he's credible, so I want you to find a study of his that disproves climate change, that isn't disputed for being shitty of course.

You just pulled these names and didn't do any research on them as to why they were listed in the article. None of these scientists fit the criteria that you said was so common and widespread which is: reputable, climate denying, uses actual science to back up their claims. 

> I predict that you will have some reason to dismiss each of these credible people but, as is my point, that kind of disqualification/ cancellation is what happens to dissenters/""heretics"".

You are acting like the people you listed are being dismissed because they have reputable evidence against climate change. Roger Pielke Jr. is the only one name you listed that uses actual science, and his research is being used by the IPCC and he doesn't deny climate change. The other ones aren't being disputed because they are climate deniers, they are being disputed because they have nothing substantial to back their beliefs up."
Futurology,fff64lc,t1_ffew9jn,1579876680.0,Do you have evidence-based journal articles disproving our current understanding on climate change?
AskReddit,ffdxzxw,t1_ffdvq4h,1579831731.0,"> He has been cancelled which is my point exactly.

Because he made shitty papers with severe methodology flaws, so why should he be hired. The scientists that Willie Soon uses as references in his own papers literally say that they were misrepresenting their data. The papers he made are so incredibly shitty that when the Baliunas controversy happened, the review process of the journal was called into question because the paper had somehow bypassed their peer review. It's as embarrassing as a zoology journal publishing an article of a child's story about unicorns and treating it as if it was serious in their latest volume.

AskReddit,ffdpnei,t1_ffci1b1,1579825969.0,"It's really surprising how many links provided by climate deniers include Willie Soon. I'm surprised he was even hired after the Soon and Baliunas controversy which you should read up on. His main supporter in the article Myron Ebell isn't even a scientist or a researcher. 

What is the second article even saying? That funding in climate science has increased from before? Same thing with literally any new technology and fields that we want more understanding of. 

I was hoping for examples of scientists that have *reputable* papers on climate change and actual research. You know how when people cite studies on vaccines you probably don't want to cite Wakefield who falsified data saying that the MMR vaccine caused autism just to sell his own version of the MMR vaccine? Kinda like that. 

Here's an example. Since AR5's release and the subsequent meltdowns surrounding the drastic RCP8.5 model being called ""business as casual"", an unintentional effect occurred which skewed many studies shortly after because they would use the RCP8.5 model as the base model. This would affect many debates because this model acted as the consensus even though it was an unlikely scenario. We now know that we are actually closer on a closer path to the RCP6 model due to the evidence from actual climate researchers. This change has been noted in the AR6 being released in a couple years, and thanks to the scientists who published trustworthy studies, the AR6 is now being more clear with the addition of SSP's. So there is an example of climate scientists opposing the 'consensus' being opposed by actual evidence.

facepalm,fehh2un,t1_feh37my,1579116392.0,"The 2013 climate models in the IPCC show ranges of warming and impacts depending on different emission scenarios. The ""worst case scenario"" model you are talking about is the RCP8.5 which is the most drastic model shown in the AR5, but the AR5 also references 3 other RCP models with lower emissions. The most current evidence points out that we are on a closer path to RCP6 than to RCP8.5 which is of course good news, but it's kind of flippant to just ignore the negative effects of how 3C above pre-industrial levels by 2100 will affect the world, especially poorer nations. While it's not apocalyptic, it should still be taken seriously. I agree with what you said here.

The special reports reference thousands of publications, with new models and information that have been published after AR5. They do not rely solely on the RCP8.5 model, it only offers what would happen if it does among other models as it cannot be ruled out. The reports are not solely on predictions but studies and results on what has actually happened since AR5. 

Overall, I agree with your points regarding that we need to change the mainstream idea from apocalypse to what the actual science reflects, but it's still not pretty and should be taken very seriously.

I'm unsure what you are saying in the second link you provided. As a Canadian, I think Joe Oliver is a piece of shit. His selfish mindset is how he kept pushing selling asbestos to poorer nations who didn't have environmental and health regulations that existed here in Canada. He suggests that Canada doesn't need to act against climate change because some areas will benefit from the increase in arable land and a longer growing season. That's ignoring the negative effects of climate change on the country as if the severe weather already happening will not be a factor. The incidence of diseases that normally thrive in hot environments are already increasing as climate change occurs, and new vectors will keep popping up as the climate warms. 

""Over the last 20 years, the incidence of most of these endemic mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) has increased approximately 10% in Canada, due in large part to climate change.""

Pine beetles sure are loving the warmer weather here which has resulted in millions of dead trees across the west coast. I guess it's cool that a few provinces may benefit overall from climate change, but I'm not sure if people would be too happy knowing that it's at the cost of other nations being negatively affected. It also ignores the major refugee crisis that will happen as extreme weather affects developing nations. He keeps referring to an economic benefit (which the study assumes has a fixed relationship to the climate) as if it outweighs the suffering that will happen."

Would love to read the journal articles that said these things if you have them. Kind of strange how these predictions seem to be about specific events seeing as how that's not how climate models work, climate models predict trends and not specific events. People can try and predict what events may occur if certain trends happen, but that's not what climate models do. 

Take a look at this model, specifically AR4 models.

AskReddit,fdrzdso,t1_fdpzvwl,1578691966.0,"I agree with you that the world won't suddenly explode in 10 years. The evidence I'm using is the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C published by the IPCC that says it is possible through extreme intervention to restrict climate change to 1.5°C by 2030 (and to be net-zero in 2050) because our current path to 2°C (and higher) will greatly exacerbate the effects of climate change. I believe it's where the original ""12 years"" number, now 10 years, comes from. Anyone who claims that there is some cataclysm that will end the world in 10 years is bogus and isn't looking at the literature, I agree with you there. 

Was kind of hoping for peer-reviewed journal articles and not online blogs and news articles.

The first article you posted doesn't really provide any evidence. I agree when it said

> What's less settled is how humans and the rest of biodiversity on the planet will fare in the decades and centuries to come. 

as the important focus of what scientists mean with the 12 year figure. I don't agree with the nonchalant, lack of urgency tone regarding the need for action. 

The second article you posted has some weird paragraphs.
 
> However, some experts argue that carbon dioxide is only a minor player in this atmospheric hothouse effect. Ice cores from Antarctica show that at the end of recent ice ages, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise only after temperatures began to climb.

This is really misleading. We've known that after an ice-age, the initial increase in global temperature is due to the changes in the planet's orbit since it is what caused the initial ice-age anyway. What CO2 does it amplify that warming. It's something we've known since 1990. It is also implying that 30%-40% of the total warming (the part caused by CO2) is somehow 'minor'.

Maybe I just couldn't find it but the article doesn't talk about the 12 year prediction. Overall, an interesting read on the history of climate science!

I'm unsure about what you are trying to say with your last source because it's saying the opposite of your claim.
