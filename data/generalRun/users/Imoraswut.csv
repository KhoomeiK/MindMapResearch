That's completely beside the point. I'm saying Sanchez and Vecino are included in the squad because they're can be called up to play, whereas someone like Pirola is more likely to be included just for the experience.

Sanchez or Esposito instead of Politano and Lukaku out instead of Lautaro - Politano hasn't worked out well once in Conte's system, whereas the other two have adapted better. While both Lukaku and Lautaro had a shit second half, Lautaro is more dangerous and more likely to produce, particularly against a top side like Atalanta.
