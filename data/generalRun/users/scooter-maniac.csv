trashy,ffa3xof,t1_ffa2x3l,1579727398.0,"I don't think bike racks are near plentiful enough to meet the demand for these scooters. Here in Denver we have 5 companies, all of which are allowed 300 scooters on the streets at a time. Large convention areas have dedicated spots for them like Invesco field and the Pepsi Center. The problem areas are near apartments. Most apartments don't have bike racks out front because anybody with a bike brings it inside with them.

&#x200B;

The problem with geofencing is accuracy. GPS is only accurate to 3 meters in perfect conditions. You put a tall building in the way and that drops significantly. Every place these scooters thrive are among giant buildings.

All these scooters have bluetooth, so maybe the best way to go about it would be to put a permanent bluetooth hotspot or whatever at these spots and then make it so the scooters can't lock without being within range of that hotspot."
trashy,ffa2gia,t1_ffa1las,1579726552.0,"Yes they are scattered everywhere, but that's because we don't have the infrastructure yet. Cars were scattered everywhere before dedicated roads and parking spots, this is the same thing."

There are 50 assholes who don't  like scooters and kick them over whenever they get a chance. I have probably 100 recording of it happening in front my my apartment. I pick up all the scooters in front of my house probably 5-10 times a week. It's super frustrating. It happens mostly on Sunday/Mondays oddly enough.

Value is what we should be looking for in an immigrant, and their value can't easily be determined. It's much harder to show you have value when you come from a place without a lot of opportunities. You can't discriminate against people because they came from a less advantageous place."

* 75%+ homeless people do not want jobs, so why the hell are they receiving all these freebies? 
* Too fat to work? Then you gotta lose weight or starve.
* No health insurance? Pay for it the rest of your life.

I am also not entirely on the liberal side of abortion. Yes, if you want an abortion in the first trimester you should be able to get one without being questioned. 2nd/3rd trimester abortions for healthy fetuses shouldn't be allowed. I am not a female so I don't know how bad your health has to be to miss the signs of pregnancy for 3 months, so that's a grey area I shouldn't have an opinion on."
