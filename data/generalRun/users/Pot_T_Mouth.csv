if you can drag yourself out of bed do a couple exercises(push ups or something) or listen to some good uptempo music and take a shower to get you out of that morning fog(or coffee and a nice sativa =)) .  it helps me break through that feeling where you can hear the bed calling you back.  i have 3 sweet pups who love to cuddle so it makes it even harder to resist.




one problem ive found (because ive been in that exact scenario you describe) is just dont beat yourself up about it! it kinda snowballs.  you probably need the sleep and its ok to just not do anything sometimes. ive learned in my later years due to my own personal circumstances depression is a nasty nasty beast and often tries to take me down that road."

His ultimate is busted as fuck, his speed is in my top 10 for most oppressive and bullshit abilities in the game— at least give his cross fade a cooldown, and he just gets free kills for pressing m2 near cliffs. Lucio has been the most slept on overpowered hero for literally years now, and now that I will be able to ban heroes I’ll pretty much always vote to ban lucio. If it’s not lucio then I’m either banning zenyatta or Baptiste because those two are almost as retarded as lucio.

1. turn off windows setting thats something like ""reboot on critical error"" 
this does a couple things because if its a power issue that wont have any effect and it will still reboot most likely, also youll be able to see the blue screen error if it does which might lead you in another direction

2. new power cord
3. different outlet
4. new/different surge protector
5. this part can be tricky but basically if your current PSU is modular or has extra cables try to switch out your main power cables(the main power for your MOBO and the one for your GPU) *Edit* also check for loose cables here

you could get lucky and it be an internal cable issue

after that id probably go ahead and replace the PSU
