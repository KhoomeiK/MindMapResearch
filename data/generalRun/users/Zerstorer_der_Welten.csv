I do have plans to make a mod which will add something to that area, northwest of that big mountain but it's such an in depth mod it may take me a long time to build with limited free time and the fact I have to learn as I go. Just as a taster I want to create a proper Merchants Guild under the East Empire Trading Company, I'm hoping to involve the Khajiit Caravans as well and work it in with existing EETC. I've got a lot of ideas for it, at the moment I'm just working out the CK so I can build the main assets and work out what I'll need to support it.

For other mod developers:  I would encourage other house builders to consider looking at the unpopulated areas to place things, putting everything in one area also makes it so users will only use one mod at a time because of worldspace conflicts, you're not only doing the game a favor by populating boring areas, you are doing yourself a favor in making sure more people will use the mod. :)"

Cool, might try, but honestly think about doing something with that massive empty area right next to Whiterun that takes up a massive chunk of the map. There's over a dozen Riverwood homes, plenty of Reach homes, and a bundle of homes along that massively over-crowded mountain range, there are currently maybe 4, yes only 4 player homes in that massive open area where there is nothing and it's really boring and annoying to run around, it'd be a prime place for a mountainside castle, a large estate, even a quest based shack, but no, we just get more player homes for the same areas everyone else does...Maybe I'll make one for just outside Whiterun, you know, squashed in that little strip of land near Honningbrew, because having 6 locations crammed in there clearly isn't enough, at least that's what some player home builders think... :)"

Stellaris,ffd3rtk,t1_ffc21ul,1579812851.0,"Then you misunderstood me, it's not that I dislike hyperlanes at all, they are a different form of strategy that I call ""dumb strategy"" but that doesn't mean I dislike them, they create an alternative dynamic and by removing other options they create a restricted playing field with only one tactical option, bottlenecks, there is then only one counter-strategy repetitive or overwhelming assault to break the bottleneck, that's the essence of dumb strategy.

When it comes to ""chasing fleets around"" that was a symptom of the horrible AI, which couldn't decide to attack, retreat, move, run around with it's skirts in a bunch, or just do nothing at all.  Improve the AI and it will know not to just go in circles and will do things like lead you to ambush, actually defend it's weaker points and not sit fleets in systems with no strategic value just to be obtuse.  The AI doesn't use strategy at all, anyone who thinks it does is sorely mistaken, what it does is weigh ""Enemy has 100000 fleet power, I have 100000, now attack!"" it doesn't calculate the difference between a 100K Corvette fleet and 100K of Battleships, it doesn't try to calculate the easiest method of approach, it doesn't even think about bottlenecks on a strategic system that only contains bottlenecks.

When there were three types of FTL there were also placeable defences, you could build defence platforms in specific places in solar systems, you could place them around the edge of the system, right next to your resource stations or all around your habitable planets, you actually had to think about distributing your defensive emplacements, instead of just clicking an upgrade button on a space station only to have it not defend your outer structures and anything a decent distance away. That is how you defend, like in real life, we build defences around assets to keep people out, not defences in arbitrary places to maybe engage anything that comes in range."

That could all change if they would only take the time to investigate a better AI system and implement it, that's most of the problem, the AI is crap, always has been and as long as they persist with this non-specific overloaded weighting system which only works in small-scale variable environments with the conditional control they've implemented, well the AI is not going to get any better, it can't get better because it isn't smart enough to do what it already does.

A better AI means they can re-implement the multiple FTL methods again because the AI will know how to cope with it, unlike before. They can also have working sector management because the AI will know how to manage it properly, all they have to do is develop an actual AI system which thinks more than ""10 is highest, I have 10 10's, I'll do the first 10 over and over because I can't decide what's more important, because everywhere else is 10's too!!!"""

Could be an entire horror themed thing too, fade out and come back to dead bodies grotesquely murdered everywhere. You go to a city, black out, dead bodies, you go to a town but manage to stay a day, then black out, dead bodies. The trauma to the player would be awesome, especially with closer NPC character deaths, maybe it all starts from looting that one shiny little ring with seemingly awesome stats but when you put it on the stats vanish and the ring won't come off, the curse begins and only by deciphering the very small writing on the ring which you don't notice until later, can you find the identity of the one who cursed it and the possibly Daedra who empowered them. Or you can put off getting that curse broken and just keep randomly slaughtering entire settlements, could be there all week and suddenly, black out, dead bodies, that in itself would make for a really interesting playthrough. :)

Essentially you'd have to check quest involvement for each NPC at Winterhold to ensure they won't utterly break the game if they die, make any modifications necessary, make the NPC's non-essential, modify dialog that refers to Winterhold in certain aspects and them maybe create a quest so you have a reason beyond a head-cannon RP."

Btw this concept scares me in real life, because multi-shot crossbows are inherently unsafe and dangerous to the user, there's a lot of recoil in releasing a string tight enough to launch a single bolt, let alone multiple bolts and the chances of bad trajectory, bolt flipping and such are just crazy.

It seems one thing Skyrim isn't great at is limiting things, there's ways to restrict weapons to ammo and ammo to weapons but they are incredibly clunky because one of the principles of Skyrim is no restrictions, you can do magic in heavy armor, or use a claymore as a mage, you can use any arrow type regardless of level and any weapon regardless of class. It's great to appeal to wider player bases but sucks when trying to mod in specialised functions like crossbows with spread.

That's your options there, write a clunky script for the crossbow to restrict ammunition, then try to find a workaround for the shout mechanics to let them be applied to a projectile instead. If the core code for the Shotgun was still there you could potentially use that but as far as I know those projectile types don't actually have any methods attached and therefore don't do anything."

writers,feuvqi1,t3_eqld1i,1579390414.0,"TBH it probably has to do with their development procedure, judging by limited licensing it would mean they have actually developed separate application for each platform, instead of using .NET cross-platform technology to create a single product they can deploy on multiple operating systems.

Essentially they are paying twice or more to develop a dedicated program instead of a core release that gets ported.  There are good reasons to do this, the first and foremost is that an application developed for a single environment can be more stable, more powerful and easier to maintain within its environment.

In conclusion they are not charging for the same license, the license isn't interchangeable and there are serious financial burdens associated with the development of each product.  As you said life happens, that isn't really the problem of a developer, they didn't buy your computer nor cause you to select an entirely different platform, if anything their program and license should have influenced you to buy another Mac, so it shouldn't be up to them to eat the development cost of their program because life happened to you.

Edit: For an example of a Moustache Pete that was clean shaven then I give you Joe Masseria, just to show it wasn't so much the facial hair but the standards they wanted to get away from, the closed Italian only thing was holding Italian-American mobsters back and Masseria was one of the ring leaders of that old game."

fo4,fe6lynq,t1_fe6gigl,1578895391.0,"Most people just don't understand Game Engines at all, they think it's like a sequel to a game and when that sequel is used up you start a new iteration, that is definitely not the case as most popular game engines found their beginnings in the 90's and were only adapted to new hardware standards. They don't understand that a Game Engine is only a framework and not an entire product, it is the core packages required to process and render programmed information. They also don't seem to realize that building a Game Engine from scratch is a project that takes years with the scope of games these days.

My soul died a little inside when I saw the first ""Abandon this old engine"" comment, if you couldn't tell.  I just wish gamers would at least *try* to understand the systems they're using, but they really don't, they might as well pick up a knife by the blade and try to cut a steak with it, that's effectively what playing games without understanding game engines amounts to, and that's from a competitive perspective, back in my true gamer days I had to know the engine to know it's limits and how to get an edge within that engine, simple stuff like knowing that a rocket fired at a particular angle at a particular thing will only kill that thing and not yourself because of collision meshes which break the area of effect programming, an exploit to be sure, but one within the bounds of the engine and which could give me an edge in the right situation, especially if I create the right situation. 

The Engine does need a fair overhaul, but the biggest thing is Bethesda developers need to learn how to use it properly, instead of bootstrapping and band-aiding they should be looking at integration and rectification, integrate the bootstrapped features, rectify the problems covered by band-aid fixes, thoroughly test, then start again, and repeat, until polished product is produced. I've often thought they must have a lack of high-end programmers who know how to work with engines and instead have a majority of coders who only have a basic idea of the back end (And they're not alone, Paradox are much the same, can't bug fix properly or optimize effectively), and I know plenty of programmers like that, they can build a basic app on a framework but they have no idea where to start with building that framework.

All that said I do have to say it's always easier when on the outside looking in, than being in the shit and trying to keep your head above it. ;)"

television,fe6jonf,t3_edjag7,1578893094.0,"Could have been a great Monster of the Week show, ended up an abortion of bad directing practices, sensationalism and pointlessness. 

I watched the entire first season...Actually I ""forced myself through"" the first season, and I didn't find redemption in any of it, the bad just keeps on coming, the cheap just keeps being displayed, the awkward is prevalent throughout the entire show. Fuck I'd prefer to watch Season 6 of The Walking Dead with that fuckwit Neegen than this crap, and that is a profound statement on it's own because Neegen was the worst fucking villian of any show.

If they made it just about the witcher and the mage and had them chasing actual monsters instead of trying to fabricate some kind of hollow court intrigue to try and capture viewers then it might actually be something worthwhile, instead I've watched a dozen conversations which make no sense because there is no actual government to have intrigue for, just a bunch of factions, the kings and queens are essentially just warlords and they don't have an entourage, they have a company of warriors, how can you pretend there's a story there?  It's just people causing reasons to fight so they can have scene's with pointless violence and inconsequential killing, just like the nudity they've injected in there, it serves no purpose, unlike Game of Thrones when Nudity was used as a pointed exclamation, why do we have to see the mage with her tits out when she changes?  Because nudity draws viewers, it added absolutely nothing at all whatsoever to the scene, just tits for the sake of tits. 

I think you were generous, my rating was 2/10, they lost marks for ripping off an already existing story in a really bad way, not true to the books, not true to the first TV series, not true to the Games, just a spin on the Witcher theme as a cash grab, but can I say I'm surprised?  Welcome to Netflix and it's poor quality serialized vomit, which is funny considering how much money they pump into these abortions, yet actual good shows get let go, like The Expanse.  As of this moment I am cancelling my Netflix subscription, so sick of their shit service, I get better viewing on Stan with better quality content, even the Stan Originals are about 1000% better than Netflix's mass produced diarrhea.
