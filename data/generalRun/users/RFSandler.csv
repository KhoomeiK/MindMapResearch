Futurology,ffu7erp,t1_fftn9o1,1580236063.0,I think it depends on how stable the nutrients are and how resilient a given species is to flux. Dunno if fish waste would be too rich in nitrogen for trees.
Futurology,fftkuh8,t1_fftib5t,1580223155.0,"Hydroponics have a huge upfront material input to build the system. So far it's not practical for any staple good, however good it might be for fruits and greens. The productivity gains just aren't there for grains and fiber crops, which have a long growth time and relatively low yield per acre.

Technically we can also do hydroponic fruit trees, I've seen a blog from a guy in Australia who has something like a 10 meter lemon tree in a really big bucket. Does it as a cool thing, not for practicality."
Futurology,fftktl5,t1_ffthhe6,1580223138.0,Point is that there are sylviculture/forestry practices where we can extract large amounts of wood AND preserve habitats.
todayilearned,fflmw4p,t1_fflge06,1580041575.0,Speaking to human nature - we're selfish and bad at logic when it cuts near to the heart.

worldnews,ff2v7py,t1_ff2ugh5,1579525452.0,That's how we know Trump wasn't READ IN on aliens at Area 51. I'm sure they would have a sanitized briefing for Presidents that don't need to know.

CALexicon,ff2qduu,t1_ff2nj5h,1579519255.0,"I know AA is chronologically before DD, but given its side story nature and deeper dive into the mechanics of the world I think it's perfectly alright to put DD before AA in reading order. Especially since it's been completed already rather than salivating for months/years for more books."

Cosmere,fel32vk,t1_fekzjpv,1579213001.0,"I'm not sure how I feel about him doing it by himself, given that he has no previous screen play experience that I know of. Hopefully he has some TV/movie writing friends who can help and review."

worldnews,fdkgrz1,t1_fdkegt0,1578503548.0,The betrayal was in timing and pacing. An unannounced pull out in the face of an incoming enemy action is a betrayal. A scheduled pull out with an ally approved plan of action is not.
RobinHood,fdh69f4,t3_elc3l6,1578416278.0,"I just wish the app provided any sort of notification that had happened, or a reminder that the pay out for partial shares was pending. I know it's not in their control what happens but they can still put any indicator at all in the system."
