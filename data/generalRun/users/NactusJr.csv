Did I object your way of thinking? of course. not to mention your chocolate theory also has a big flaw. earth is not a ball it is true, it is round with slight ellipse. there are data and information everywhere about it unlike the chocolate wannabe. differentiate between facts, opinion, and common sense. when it is backed up with data and numbers its called fact. when you think its right but no data to back it up its called opinion, when someone tells you to eat chocolate which smells like crap its common sense.

the template used in my university usually has 5-6 chapters and the 4th chapter is always showing the process on how to get results which are written in 5th chapter

`If someone makes a claim, and then says i cant see the proof because its too big, or too far, or too expensive, then i have no good reason to believe what they say.`

what can't you see? that the earth is too big? there's literally an exact number telling you how big the earth is and it is explained how they get the number. too far? have you ever been in a plane? have you ever gone to faraway country? the time to get there compared to the speed of your transportation alone should be common sense. too expensive? do you know how costly a research is? have you ever done actual research outside google and youtube?

 `If all those people are actually getting the same results, then it should be no problem for me to get those results, right here, where i can see them personally, as they happen` 

those people are scientist. professors. people who are experts in the field with experience probably longer than you've been alive. those results you keep asking for is free on the internet if you actually search for it and read it unless you're in the middle of some amazonian jungle.

`right here, where i can see them personally, as they happen` 

how small can your point of view and mind be? its 2020, knowledge is everywhere but so does false or outdated theories. the world doesn't revolve on a knowledge from few centuries ago. 

in a few years, when SpaceX's commercial program launched you should hop in the rocket and enjoy the not perfectly round earth before realizing how insignificant and small you are compared to a planet"
flatearth,ffgyhhw,t1_fffksif,1579918321.0,"then let me ask. 

prove gravity isn't real, prove how small the earth is, prove the earth stays still.  that's right. you can't. By the way, pointing to something that someone else says or does, isn't proof. That is you trusting them.  And you can, if you wish. However, only an idiot, or an ignorant person, or someone who is both, would believe something because some person, somewhere, did something, and they say its so.

arguing how flat the earth is without knowing how small earth is a baseless claim.  for all I know I can claim that the earth is cylinder or a triangle or even an abstract.

flat earth was a fact until modern science proved it otherwise. it is now merely a theory with too many flaws."

so hate them. be angry at them. use your anger to fuel you. be so angry and pissed at them that it drives you to work hard for your own life. be so driven by your anger and hatred at them that reach your goals and prove them wrong to not want you. make them beg for your mercy and love.

tips for low bracket players who knows they are better than their bracket instead of assuming they're better:

1. pick heroes that can clear waves and tower quickly. low bracket players love kills much more than winning. something like prophet, visage.
2. pick heroes that can jungle effectively. you wont be punished in this bracket. but dont pick something like LC since she push slow. a hero like lycan would be really good as you can jungle push and solo kill enemy that is overextending.
3. dont buy midas. most of the time players in low brackets farm really ineffectively. taking objectives would further trash their farming and you will win quick and easy.
4. make the enemy tilt. this is legit strat that I used to win many games. tilting = bad mood = bad plays.
5. don't jump roles and heroes. you'll just get confused and won't be able to fully understand your heroes' maximum limits.
6. use the mute feature. dota2 players are toxic. as soon as you see a toxic chat or hear toxic voice just mute and play your game. if you reply to them you'll just get in bad mood and thus you play bad.

heroes that I used to boost my rank and still viable in this patch :

1. NP. go offlane, buy a ward and put it between tower 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. don't be cheap to use your W kill all the courirs and join all the fight unless you can get an obj
2. puck and weaver. low bracket players are trash at buying detection/disable items. get in, kill, get out rinse and repeat.
3. lycan. extremely god tier in low bracket. people dont know how to deal with this guy. get bkb and bam suddenly you're getting 2 sets of barracks
4. treant protector. really good early even in high tier. people just cant trade with you. get the meme hammer and you can get all the tower 2 before enemy carry get items.
5. bounty hunter. you wouldn't believe this but people dont care about tracks in lower bracket. I spammed like 500ish game with him and its unbelievable how enemy would just ignore bh tracks. 5-10 track kills at 12 mins almost guarantee you to win the game. just dont be an ass and build deso first item."
