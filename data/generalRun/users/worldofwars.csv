Have faith. It's all care your mind gives you at the end of the day."

My question is thus then this - being a poet requires emotion after emotion. How do you decompress and recover from such obvious trauma after receiving backlash and insult? And do you ever take out your anger in your poetry? I am not talking about reddit, I am talking about pouty PUAs and insecure males. You must be affected after having written over 10,000 poems. Do your emotions just never run out or feel drained? And if so, do you force yourself to just keep writing anyway? Does that in anyway hurt you?

Therapy? I mean that sincerely, it isn't shameful or something insulting. It is out of a sense of care that I ask. 

I have only had positive experiences with you as have very fine folk who I have associated with. You're doing just fine, keep it up, I will see you again soon and maybe you will have bought yourself a paper cutter by then. 

Take care man. Salaam."
IAmA,fdlunvj,t3_elv6qa,1578532903.0,"Whoa...this almost made me want to shit something awful. I am going to quit reddit after seeing how awful everyone was. Looks like the old adage is true after all. Birds of a feather flock together and Reddit seems to be the nesting spot for these poor folk. 

My dude, you aren't exactly a superherosport, but you are an actual poet. I am probably not the first to tell you this, but you have inspired some very good feelings in very good people. Feelings of love, of laughter, of joy. And of course, of touristy novelty, but whatever. 

I think you should stick to the park and leave this shithole. I enjoy seeing you out there. You dont ever recognize me, but we probably have jumped each other's throats a few times with poem/rap battles. I obviously win everytime, but you are so much drained I dont blame you for losing to me once every so often. I like you there bro, keep doing what you're doing. 

To all the folks claiming a white knight, go free a tarantula and get bitten by the scrotum. This fella is actually a polite breeze in the park. Too bad your insecurities with women have gotten in the way of appreciating his charm. 

I have never tipped you money before, only ever rewarded you with a poem of my own. Let's see you win next time and I will buy you a paper cutter myself friend. 

Keep at it, you're doing fine."
