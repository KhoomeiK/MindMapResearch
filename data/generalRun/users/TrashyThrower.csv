Sanders and maybe, MAYBE warren would. Biden would to trump specifically because he finally went beyond the pale. I think presidents get to office and see war crimes invasions etc as a necessary evil to prevent the greater evil (Russia and China being in charge of earth), and while they might take different tacts, Obama probably got there and said “Jesus Christ what a moron”, but frankly, bush didn’t do anything Clinton or Obama or bush 1 wouldn’t have done if compelled. Just think about what Obama would be responsible for if he had no drones to murder people with....
Trump is an actual honest to God traitor to our country. It’s not just him and his friends getting rich off war for profit and resources (sadly, as old a war type as mankind), Trump is trying to cover his ass from whatever Russia has on him and protect from being hung for treason.

And they were doing the exact same predatory shit, but their size, value, and tech kept them above. WF was the least offensive in way of that behavior. So he’s almost worse. He knowingly allowed predatory lending, paid off everyone and their mom to get legislation he wanted, and THEN threatens to let the economy crash if the Fed doesn’t give them money and take the bad assets.

And also, if anyone tells you that the Fed is not considered taxpayer money because it operates at a profit, you can let them know the bill allowed the Fed to borrow directly from treasury through 2009. So, yes it was.
And when you get told they paid it back? Remind them that BY infusing that money into an already stable bank, allowing them to shed bad assets of the banks they were eating up, their stock rose 10% in a single day. They made money on their own fucked behavior."

LibertarianFreeState,fcyfxup,t1_fcyfac3,1578079556.0,"I'm aware of who the Supreme Leader is.
You realize he came to power because of the destabilization of the middle east, and his use of us and england as the boogey man is what spurred the revolution? 
This ""supreme god on earth"" thing is all well and good, except he'd have no followers (he was, in fact, talking like this for a long time before he came to power, with no ears to listen) if we hadn't taken their economy into the shitter.

For real, I can't tell if you're being devil's advocate or intentionally obtuse. You think we're just out here passionately and nonviolently spreading democracy to people who want it?

We're not. They don't want us. We don't want us."
LibertarianFreeState,fcyfp3k,t1_fcyf2vt,1578079432.0,"Were you aware the people of Venezuela democratically elected a socialist who we didn't like because (just like iran in the 50s) he wanted to nationalize oil so the people would stop being dirt poor, and that would mean we'd have to pay more for oil, so we put a siege on Venezuela and then blamed the person they elected for the starvation of the people?
The UN said their election integrity was higher than ours in 2016.
We don't have to LIKE that venezuela is socialist or want to nationalize oil to get out of poverty, but it's not our place to just decide to change who's running a country, is it?"
LibertarianFreeState,fcyfis5,t1_fcyf2vt,1578079324.0,"Ugh....
There's a zero percent chance you were able to watch the video of a top general during the bush admin discussing the 6 nation toppling plan that ends with iran.

Right? 

You don't have to hate America to know that your country is not doing the right things or the wrong things for the right reasons.

My dad cheated on my mom as a kid. I hated that he did it, and held him accountable, but did not hate my father.

Would you say your opinion is if we do it it's the right thing to do? 

We can tit for tat passive aggressively act like the other person is the moron, or we can ask where you or I draw the line."
LibertarianFreeState,fcyeb7j,t1_fcyb62h,1578078839.0,"So your opinion is this guy would be born a fundamentalist in Iran if Iran was still this...when there....were no fundamentalists in Iran?:
We were close with Palahvi, kept reassuring him, while we continued to impoverish his nation, which half the people (non religious) were aware of, and knew. This is why, while the revolution was happening, the non-religious people did jack shit about it, because they hated him too, because he was our puppet.

Let's say, hypothetically, NOBODY ever invaded those places. You believe that guy's going to attack America, who he's never had a bomb dropped by, never seen a soldier for, and never had friends and family (some innocent) killed by as a teenager?

It's not a chicken and egg situation. It's been a 50+ year conscious military decision.

I'm no 9/11 truther, but this is a top general, wesley clark, talking about how the plan was clear during the bush admin.

For fuck's sake, if you can't even realize we fuck other countries so we can have cheap gas and tvs, you're 100% no libertarian at all.

We can be the better guy (than Russia or China), but we are not the good guy either.
If we were, why would most countries in the world believe we're the greatest threat to world peace?
Because of some big misunderstanding? Because they hate us cuz they ain't us?

No dude. Sorry. We literally made Bin Laden. Actually and literally. We create power vacuums constantly and let them get filled by worse people than before. Half of them we fund until they take over (see also castro, see also what's his name from afghanistan, see also Venezuela)

Come. On. Sheeple.

If we can't start the conversation about who's the bad guy here, when we created: 

Hussein, Bin Laden, and the entire fundamentalist region starting with fucking the president of Iran in 1956 for trying to nationalize oil....

is kind of silly.

""he's a bad guy he killed all these Americans!""

""We've essentially been the empire from star wars since these guys were born, and killing their families and friends ""by accident"" for 50 years""

""BUT THEY'RE MONSTERS""

NO, he's very simply doing what he accused Obama of, creating a military issue during an election because people are afraid to vote for new presidents when we're in a war.

Also, the strong likelihood is Iran's gonna get a dirty bomb into the US and set it off. They can't fight us on a military front, but they can definitely send 1 dude with a briefcase."
LibertarianFreeState,fcy326z,t1_fcxyhg5,1578074058.0,"This dude EXISTS because of us.

My point was, Saudi Arabia is ALSO regularly funding terrorism targeted at the US. The difference is Ivanka's autobot husband can't open a TGIFridays in Iran.

Or do we forget that for the last 20 years Trump himself has been saying 9/11 was 100% perpetrated by Saudi Arabia?

Then suddenly crown prince gives Kushner's company 50million in liquid cash and we're pals?
Fucking please dude.

He's the bad guy. We're also the bad guy.

There's a reason literally every non-partisan military official we have said to stay in the Iran deal. What's not to get? They let us in to their facilities, we make them unable to enrich uranium to the point of nuclear fuel for warheads, it's that simple. 

If you think this problem starts with the day this guy started planning attacks on our invasion forces in the middle east....you'er...not a Libertarian at all."
LibertarianFreeState,fcxu5wj,t1_fcx44t9,1578070540.0,"Yeah, 

How about the actual Libertarian response: What the fuck, stop doing this, bring every troop home and let them point their guns OUT.

You can't have the opinion that we shouldn't have done something with Saudi Arabia for killing Kashoggi and then think this unprovoked, unwarned, and very...not-suggested by anyone in the intel or military community, nor either side of the aisle.

Every think tank on the planet says Iran war is endless and likely ends with a dirty bomb going off in the US so. great.

&#x200B;

hence why we gave them money to let us destroy their nuclear facilities."
