I mean, we won’t... but I can tell you that continuing to pretend like there’s some kind of irrationally behind the fascist mindset is not helping and continuing to humanize them when they deserve no such thing.

They aren’t irrational, they are hateful, racist, psychopathic fascists and they are getting exactly what they want, which doesn’t require validation from anyone that the rhetoric they spout is factual or rational."

Absolute worst case scenario in the rare rare rare times I’ve faced the challenge I just grab another charger and plug it in, or use the one that I kept in the same place, maybe for other things. Conversely, they provide a lot of convenience and time saving every day. 

There is absolutely no downside to having them around to use, other than the cost. You can always plug in if you have to."
