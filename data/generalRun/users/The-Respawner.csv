He has been corrected by a seemingly aggressive or dog reactive dog at a park (owners let their dogs run loose and up to our dog), and he backed off after the smaller dog snapped at him twice."

puppy101,fexdahu,t1_fevcbmf,1579429068.0,"Thank you for the long and detailed reply!

Interesting to hear you have a similar experience, what breed did you have? 

About the leash thing, I have seen some people say that keeping him on leash while other dogs play may make him leash reactive, but I don't really know what else to really do, because he is already almost 20 lbs and bigger than most at a similar age. 

Good idea to train a good ""call off"", I haven't seen that suggestion before and it seems like a good to deal. 

We are going to meet a 1.5 year old golden afterwards for a playdate with some friends. This golden can be a bit unsure about bigger dogs (probably because of insecurity), but is appearently nice with smaller/younger dogs. At what point should we intervene if Bark (our dog) is getting a bit too rough or annoying for the golden? Should we let the golden correct him, or intervene before?

Also, out of curiosity, are you a trainer or just a big dog enthusiast?"

She only told me to interrupt play and ""break open"" his mouth once when he latched on to a puppies clothes for too long, the other times I removed him before she had to comment. A bit embarrassing towards the other owners, also having to keep him on leash while the other dogs run around playing nicely, I got to admit!"

They are pretty much like a hunting husky, but more loyal/people/family oriented and they aren't typically sled dogs, though they of course *can* be.  It's a confident, brave and smart breed that I hope will work well for us.

AskVet,fc8b32r,t1_fb4hwux,1577530908.0,"So the vet did some neurological tests 10 days ago, but found nothing wrong. She prescribed pain meds, her theory was that Spirit has pain in his shoulders/neck, and that we should try and see if his behaviors changes on the pain meds. We are not sure if it did, he did seem to be a bit quicker, but still only walking in left circles. 

Weird thing is that today, he suddenly started walking to the right. And he just doesn't really stop.  He just circles, and circles, and circles. When we pick him up he is trying to climb us to look to the right, if we have him on our lap he will try to turn and look to the right and keep his eye to the right as much as he can without moving when we hold him. His pupils are also wide open, but that might just be the lighting. His head is not tilted. 

He does have an inflamed tooth (which will be removed), but the vet didn't think that had anything to do with it. 

When he stops circling, he will stand still and look very confused, looking forwards and to the right before continuing circling. He will walk forwards sometimes after circling x amount of times to the right, but then find another place to circle around. 

Our vet doesn't know, but we will be taking Spirit for another vet visit. Do you have any clue?
