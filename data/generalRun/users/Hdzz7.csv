depression,fefqemh,t3_eotd1i,1579062243.0,I’ve been taking medication for my anxiety at the age of 8 I’m 20 now and at 15 my psychiatrist diagnosed me with severe depression I taken almost every medication for both some worked some didnt and the ones that worked usually had side affects all I can say is that I’m tired of taking medications it’s like I feel that’s the only thing that’s gonna keep me going that day so I am taking a different route and told myself that this year I will find another method to help with my depression and I found a mental health group that meets weekly  in my city and plan to join and see if that could be something new that could help with my depression where I don’t have to rely on medications to keep me going

lonely,fefoq85,t3_eov9ev,1579061037.0,I experienced the same feeling before but in my case I got into a relationship..I had the perfect girl she was always there for me and we had a fine relationship nothing wrong at all. but unfortunately I made the decision to break up with her because of my mental state I was and still am depressed  I thought it would fill the void but I still felt that loneliness a relationship unfortunately won’t really fix anything I took a hard step and ultimately went to see a doctor and although it still hurts me that we aren’t together just remember that your mental health always comes first take that step and try to seek some help because if you get into a relationship now unfortunately you might end  up in the same boat I was in learn from me take your time with it I know it’s hard I still feel lonely but I know I can not get into a relationship at this time Because my health I’m working towards getting better .. I hope you figure everything out and find happiness remember there’s others just like you you’re not alone keep your head up better days will come
