depression,ffgnryf,t3_etd5c4,1579910553.0,"Those horrible thoughts are all lies.  I once spent the night with a suicidal friend.  She could have still taken those pills when I wasn't looking, but I like to think that my presence deterred her.  She is still alive today, many years later, and enjoying her grandchildren.  She's glad she didn't give in to the darkness.  You may feel that no one cares, but you are probably wrong about family and friends, and even if they don't, God does.  So often what seems hopeless today becomes a better future.  That was true for me at a time when I thought everything was over.  I hung onto the Lord, kept plodding on, and within two years everything turned around.  I am so glad I didn't give up.  To all of you here, please don't give up either.  God loves you, and you have no idea what beautiful things are just around the corner.  If you don't have a local resource to turn to, you could call 855-382-5433 for free help.  I pray for peace and joy for you all."
TrueChristian,ffeezy0,t3_es682k,1579845511.0,"I see many good suggestions here already.  Perhaps it would also be a blessing to focus on the Gospels just to become better acquainted with Jesus and see His power at work.  Also, are you part of a church fellowship?  We all need support and encouragement.   A small group Bible study could be very supportive in your struggles--it has been for me.  Please don't carry these burdens alone.  God means for us to be part of His body, the Church.  I pray that you will find the support you need to stay strong, grow in your faith, and continue to become the man God wants you to be.  God bless you."
TrueChristian,ffeb4tg,t3_est02d,1579841834.0,"How does a bride feel when she looks into the eyes of her groom on their wedding day?  She is thrilled to be with him and wants only to please him.  That's how our relationship with Jesus is meant to be--the New Testament compares Him to our bridegroom.   So just learn to love Him better each day and the rest will follow.  When you love Him, you want to hear His Word, you want to talk to Him, you want to please Him by forsaking sin and being obedient.  It's good to have a regular time every day to read the Bible and pray.  But you can also pray throughout the day when things come up.  You think about someone in need, and breathe a little prayer for them.  Something nice happens, or you see something beautiful, and you say thank you.  And so on.  God has not given us rigid rules about our devotional life, but as you put Him first in your heart, the details will fall into place.  Also don't just read the Bible, study it.  Here's an article to help you get started with that:  [https://bit.ly/2RnsTbt](https://bit.ly/2RnsTbt).  God will bless you as you stay the course and get to know Him more and more."
relationship_advice,ffagpsz,t3_esiss1,1579735345.0,"One more thought:  your families will get over surprise in time.  My daughter's friend's mom urged the abortion to begin with, but I think she also regretted it later.  I recall how she went overboard with a baby shower for that next baby."
relationship_advice,ffafzk4,t3_esiss1,1579734862.0,"My daughter's best friend had an abortion, and it broke her heart.  She still regrets it.  Later she had 2 other unplanned pregnancies, but kept those children.  Although finances are tight, they are doing ok and she loves those delightful kids.  Two of my own 4 kids were also unplanned, the last at a difficult time in our lives.  But God provided, and I don't know what I would do without either of them.  That youngest daughter is the one I'm closest to, who will take care of me when I'm old.  God knew I needed her!  Another consideration is that having a baby is easier when you're young.  Getting up in the night was tough when I was 40!   Furthermore,  taking care of a child doesn't have to cost a fortune.  I found all sorts of ways to save money.  You don't need all the fancy stuff, and thrift stores are good too.  Also, crisis pregnancy centers like the one in my city offer all kinds of baby supplies, and while you are pregnant, free ultrasounds.  I hope you choose to have this child--it is already a child, with your DNA.  If you really can't care for a baby now, adoption is a great choice.  So many lovely people are longing for a baby.  May God guide you and provide for you, as He did for me."
TrueChristian,ff4kxcg,t3_erlh3g,1579566106.0,"I agree that the easiest way to share is your own personal stories.  It's natural to talk about what is important to you so when you are chatting with a friend, often something you just read in your Bible, some answered prayer, something that struck you in Sunday's message, etc., will fit in the conversation.  Who you are and what is important to you will shine through your  words and actions and attitudes.  Don't worry about this or try to force opportunities.  God will give them to you, and when you are in tune with Him, the words will just flow from your mouth.  Don't forget to pray for the people God lays on your heart too.  Congratulations  on your new life in Christ.  You are embarking on the greatest adventure.  God will surely bless your desire to share it."

For physical causes, go to [mercola.com](https://mercola.com) and put depression in the search bar.  For emotional causes, seek counseling.  For guilt or other spiritual aspects, see a pastor.

Christianmarriage,feuaw74,t3_ep0o3e,1579384844.0,"Congratulations on your desire to honor God and handle your life in the best way.  There's a lot of good advice here already, and this list of articles offers more:   [https://list.ly/list/1xay-planning-for-marriage-not-just-the-wedding](https://list.ly/list/1xay-planning-for-marriage-not-just-the-wedding).  But I suggest that you not overthink this.  Life is full of challenges, married or single, and I found it was wonderful to have a partner to face them with.  The main thing is to be sure God is leading you.  When I knew my husband was about to propose I spent a long time in prayer, telling the Lord I would give him up if  that's what God wanted.  Instead I felt a great peace.  We had 38 happy years together before he died--obviously the Lord was leading.  Perhaps the one greatest key to a good marriage is unselfishness.  Read I Corinthians 13.  When you each are putting the other first ahead of your own desires, you will both be filled with joy.  Set aside your fears and trust the Lord to lead you.  He wants only good for you.  God bless you both."
Marriage,fetqhm9,t3_epa8qe,1579378405.0,"There's some good advice already here.  I'd like to add something I learned pretty early in my marriage.  My husband was a nice guy and he loved me, but he wasn't perfect and he couldn't meet every one of my needs.  Only God could do that.  Once I accepted him as he was and loved him with no strings attached, our relationship was easier.  We still had to talk over issues as we lived together, but we made a good team.  And here are some articles with lots of insight that  will help:   [https://list.ly/list/1CDy-is-your-marriage-built-on-a-solid-foundation](https://list.ly/list/1CDy-is-your-marriage-built-on-a-solid-foundation).

God bless your marriage."
Marriage,feiztcs,t3_ep5i2r,1579151935.0,"Do you have any religious faith?  I found that God was the  biggest factor in making my marriage a success.  When I put my life in His  hands, I had His power to help me.  And often following God means you do something that seems totally opposite to the usual approach, but it turns out to be more effective  than you imagined.  Here's a list of articles that may be of help to you:  [https://bit.ly/38hiAeJ](https://bit.ly/38hiAeJ)And here are some more thoughts, based on my own experience.  First, I let go of expectations.  My husband wasn't perfect.  He  had some issues related to a difficult childhood, etc. and he was just a man.  Second, I needed to focus on just being the best I could be, with God's help.  I couldn't change him, although in time, in response to my own changes, he did change for the better too.  I tried to be unselfish and think of his needs instead of my own.  That didn't mean I became a patsy or a pushover.  Sometimes I needed to just draw a line and kindly insist on what was good for the children or me.  But unconditional love is the first basis for a happy marriage.  Self-respect, courage, but unselfish kindness are amazingly effective.  And be patient.  It takes time.   Pray and love and also find outside support for your emotional health. Friends at church were a great help to me during some rough spots.   I hope that eventually  you and your husband will both be working together, communicating, and loving unselfishly.  God bless you."
Marriage,fefltze,t3_eokqur,1579059089.0,Lots of good ideas here.  How about playing a board game together?  The Ungame also offers opportunities for deep conversation.
TrueChristian,feebld7,t3_eoij7g,1579030397.0,"I commend you for your desire to understand this book.  Many people shy away from it because of the symbolism and the many interpretations out there.  But Revelation 1:3 promises a blessing to those who heed its message.  I currently belong to a Bible study group using David Jeremiah's book Escape the Coming Night.  There is a study guide and video available with it.  He gives a very clear explanation of the most literal approach to the book, the pre-tribulation, pre-millennial view.  That is also my view, after having also studied this in theological seminary.  Another good study is The Coming World Leader by David Hocking.  For in-depth studies of Bible prophecy including Revelation, see Things to Come by J. Dwight Pentecost and The Interpretation of Prophecy by Paul Lee Tan.  A few more thoughts:  chapters 2 and 3 are a fascinating study of different types of churches.  I believe there are 3 layers of meaning here.  First, they were actual first-century congregations in modern Turkey.  Second, they represent the different types of churches prevalent in different eras of church history.  Third, there are churches today like each of those groups.  It behooves us to be aware of where we fit into this, and listen to the warnings.  It's also important to remember that when John wrote this down, the church was being persecuted.  He had to employ a code, as it were, because of the government's hostility.  So a knowledge of Old Testament prophecy is necessary to understand the significance of many references.  I do believe that most of the events are yet future.  But no matter which interpretation you subscribe to, some main points are clear.  There is evil power in the world which hates God, opposes Jesus, and also hates His chosen people, the Jews.  But God is sovereign.  Although He is very patient with us, allowing time for repentance, the time for judgment is coming and will be horrible for all unbelievers.  Yet even in the midst of horrible punishments on the earth, God in His mercy will save multitudes from eternal hell.  And for all of us whose sins are forgiven, Heaven is waiting, where God will wipe away all tears.  So we who know Jesus have hope and can be strong even when we are persecuted, as John's audience at that time was, and also we must be energized to get the message of grace to everyone we can, because it is absolutely vital.  May God anoint your study and give you insight from the Holy Spirit as you read, and may you experience the promised blessing."
Christian,feckqxn,t3_eo5tuw,1578976313.0,"I commend you for choosing to follow God rather than your own desires.  All of us have inclinations that go against God's standards, whether a tendency to anger, lying, etc.   We all need to access the power of the Holy Spirit to restrain the unholy flesh.  When we get to Heaven we will be free of these desires, free to experience total joy in communion with God.  May God bless you with a foretaste of that joy now as you follow Him."
depression,fe6mvzj,t3_eno7v3,1578896395.0,"I'm sorry you're finding this lack of understanding.  As a serious Christian myself, who also had a bout of depression at one time, I realize this is not a simple issue.  There are so many causes of depression, not all of them related to spiritual issues.  If depression has a physical cause, a physical solution is needed.  That's not necessarily medication, either.  Nutrition and exercise are both important.  See [mercola.com](https://mercola.com) for many articles about depression.  No matter the cause, while God does sometimes perform a miraculous healing, we can't count on that; it's not always His plan.  There might also be multiple causes.  For me, the physical catalyst was a traumatic childbirth with unnecessary surgery.  But added to that was anger.  I needed physical healing, but I also had to address the anger.  So there was a spiritual component, but just praying wasn't enough even for that.  Please try to be patient with people who just don't know the whole score and think they are being helpful.  I hope that you  will find the answers and healing that you need."
depression,fdzfbyi,t3_en2qbu,1578789657.0,"I remember when I also felt like there was no future to look forward to.  You seem to have no purpose in life, no goals.  I'm sorry.  I hope you will come out on the other side of this as I did, and find worthwhile goals and joy in seeking them.  What helped me was a personal relationship with God, and realizing that He has good plans for my life.  Giving Him my heart and obedience and worship made all the difference, and I've had a fulfilling life as a result.  There are many roots of depression, but lots of help available.  These articles--[https://bit.ly/2TgaVc0](https://bit.ly/2TgaVc0)\--offer encouraging options.

Marriage,fdt5iwn,t3_emuzu1,1578712185.0,"One of your issues results from the fact that women just naturally talk more than men.  We like to chat about details, with many more words than men use.  Maybe if your wife has someone else to talk to during the day, it would give her the release that she needs so that she doesn't have to talk as much to you.  And if you could make sure that the conversation you do have is on a deep and meaningful level, not just idle chatter, that should help too.  You do need to communicate enough to stay in tune with each others' needs and interests.  Does your job also include lots of noise and conversation?  If  you are able to get some quiet time at work, that might help too.  I find that praying for help also brings me peace.  I hope things get easier for you."
Marriage,fdpsobw,t3_emasrd,1578638953.0,"I'm sorry about this struggle.  You are certainly doing the right thing by getting help for yourself and trying to work on your marriage.  You can't ""fix"" him, but you can love him unconditionally and be as supportive as possible.  Sounds like he has given up, maybe has low self-esteem too.  It's very important to men to feel respected, so can you look for at least one thing each day to praise him for?  What are things you admired about him in the beginning?  He surely has some good qualities that you can mention, or when he does something you appreciate, thank him for it.  No need to be effusive or go overboard, just quietly mention something positive about him.  There are also physical aspects to depression--here are  some articles about that:   [https://search.mercola.com/results.aspx?q=depression#stq=depression](https://search.mercola.com/results.aspx?q=depression#stq=depression).  One thing that helps is exercise.  If your husband does not get regular exercise, maybe you could invite him to take a walk with you.  Even just getting outdoors can help.  Depression has a spiritual side too.  Do you attend a church or read the Bible?  God has the power to change our lives when we connect with Him.  This article offers some great suggestions both practical and spiritual:  [https://bit.ly/36FPPI9](https://bit.ly/36FPPI9).

depression,fdi1798,t3_el9a4b,1578433921.0,"Here's another way to look at this.  Only God has a right to decide when your life is over.  If you are still here, it means that He still has plans for you, most likely things you can't even imagine.  And suffering is not the worst thing in life.  Suffering can actually have value, when you look at it the right way and learn from it.  I know--I've been through a good deal of suffering, a couple of years when it seemed I had nothing to live for, and some very painful postpartum depression.  But God was always there, and because I held on and trusted Him, I came out into the sunshine, and along with the struggles, have had some great joy in my life.  The one major overriding purpose of life is to know God and bring Him honor.  That alone can bring joy and peace even in the middle of horrible suffering.  I can say that from experience.  Please don't give up.  Seek out physical and emotional support for your trauma and put your life in God's hands.  He loves you.  Free help is available at 855-382-5433 if you are willing to talk to someone.  I am praying for you."

depression,fdfulz8,t3_ekxc8k,1578370631.0,"I'm so sorry to hear all the hopeless comments here.  But it brings back memories of a very tough 2 years in my life, many years ago.  I could see no good future ahead, and the man I loved had dumped me.  My job and family life were both very difficult.  But I prayed a lot and did the best I could, and eventually God answered my prayers.  New doors opened and there was happiness ahead.  Please promise, all of you, that you will stick it out and look for solutions.  They are out there!  And time brings changes you haven't imagined.

Marriage,fdftsyv,t3_ekxs5q,1578370031.0,"With so many comments you may not even see this, but I will speak anyway.  I see no reason to wait.  My husband and I were much older than you, and spending so many years in longing and unfulfillment was very hard.  On the other hand, my brother and his wife got married about your age, to our mom's dismay, and they were wonderfully happy for 36 years until she died.  When you are in love and there are no red flags, why on earth would you want to wait?  If you are financially stable (don't need to be rich), then go for it!  You will grow together.  Marriage always takes work no matter your age, and compatibility is something you make happen, not something magically already there.  (Although you two sound very compatible to me!)  Put God in the center of your marriage, and you can't go wrong.  I wish you great happiness."
Marriage,fdb88sl,t3_ejettr,1578254826.0,"Who controls the spending money and budget in your home?  I hope she has no access to cash unless you give her some, and her name is not on  bank accounts or home ownership or car title.  She is not acting like a true partner.   Is she able to read English?  If so, you could ask her to read books or articles about the meaning of marriage and how it is supposed to work. You may also need to seek marriage counseling.   Perhaps, maybe as part of marriage counseling, you could write out a list of your hopes and expectations for the relationship.  What kind of person did you expect  she would be?  How did you picture your relationship?  While no one is perfect or totally measures up to their partner's hopes, we all should strive for that.  My husband and I had some counseling during a stressful time in our lives, and we did some of that list-making.  It was helpful.   Maybe she would be willing to formulate her own expectations too.  Does either of you have any religious faith?  What does she believe about the nature of marriage or what role God may have in that?   Talk about this too.  My husband and I were greatly helped by giving God first place in our relationship and looking to Him for guidance and strength.  We were able to get past our tough time.  I hope you can too."
depression,fctd6wv,t3_eikk9a,1577939558.0,"Wow, I'm sad to see all the hopeless replies here.  Why pain exists is a theological question that has been debated for centuries.  My view is expressed in Where Is God When It Hurts by Philip Yancy and The Problem of Pain by C.S. Lewis.  Sin has corrupted the world, all people, and my own heart.  That's where the hurt comes from.  But God can bring good out of anything, even that.  I would not say that getting stronger is the greatest purpose.  Rather, suffering can purify and bring wisdom (1 Peter 4:1-2).  Then we are able to comfort others who are suffering (2 Corinthians 1:3-7).  And for those who know God through Jesus, there is an eternity of joy waiting beyond this life.  The pain I have been through in my life has not crushed me, because God was always there to help, and I look forward to Heaven with Him when all pain will be past.  I wish that for everyone."
depression,fctao7i,t3_eim9l0,1577937441.0,"My sister died in an accident at the age of 4.  I was 5 at the time, and I believe God spared me from also being hurt or killed.  Something told me not to go with her.  So she, a happy child who loved Jesus, went suddenly to be with Him.  I, on the other hand, have now lived to be 73.  I've been through some tough times, some sorrows, including the initial one of losing my sister.  But I've also experienced great joy.  I was able to be married to the love of my life and have 4 children.  Now I also have grandchildren.  I love them all.  I have had the satisfaction of some accomplishments that I feel good about, and most of all, I've been able to share the love of Jesus with a good many people.  Those who learned to know Him as I do will also enjoy eternity in Heaven.  So I believe those joys outweigh the sorrows, and I am glad God chose to give me this life, despite the painful things that were also part of it.  God knows what is best for us, we don't.  I don't know why He chose to take my sister so young, but I trust that He knew what is best for both of us.  So I accept His plan for my life and try to live according to His wishes.  That's the only path to true happiness no matter what else is going on.  God's love has blessed me tremendously.  He wants to do that for everyone who is willing to say yes to Him.  I'm sorry you are feeling so sad and discouraged.  But please take heart.  Look to God and His love, read the Bible (start with the gospel of John), find a church with friendly people who will encourage and love you, and life will become much brighter.

Sometimes we're too wrapped up in day-to-day chores to pay attention and notice things, and then when something happens we didn't expect, we don't know what to do.   I eventually did find out and get some counseling for my daughter, which helped.  Later she became a counselor herself, and now she helps other people with their problems.

One more:  please be sure that you have come to God realizing your utter unworthiness, feeling sorry for all the ways you have failed to be holy and pure, and begging His forgiveness on the basis of Jesus' sacrifice.  Without that step, you cannot be cleansed of your guilt and you cannot be close to Him.  But once you are forgiven, you belong to Him and have begun your journey of growing to be like Jesus.  I pray that you will truly know Him and grow in grace every day.  There's no better way to live!"

When the Holy Spirit convicts, He leads to repentance, forgiveness, and the joy and relief of knowing you are cleansed and now free of guilt.  When the devil attacks, he drags you down with constant condemnation, spiraling deeper and deeper into despair.  Don't listen to him!  The book was The Fight, by John White.  May you experience the freedom of knowing you are now clean, and may each new day bring you more strength and guidance from the Holy Spirit as you live for Jesus.  God bless you."
