fatlogic,ffgdhg9,t3_etbmyx,1579903806.0,"Rant: Still mad I let myself gain almost 10lbs or whatever the last 5 months. What is worse I’m frustrated and impatient and want to just lose it NOW. However, I know in the long run that’s a terrible idea. I’m trying to not let it get to me. I’m trying to focus on the good I’ve been doing. 

Rave: got to the gym three times this week! I’ve also been eating better and making sure I’m eating more nutrient foods and actually having a meal. I’m trying to break the habit of skipping meals instead of snacking."
fatlogic,ffcwyc3,t1_ffcn04n,1579808996.0,Because a lot of places don’t have great dairy and gluten free items that are worth the calories or price. He’s just upset cause I used to eat it and now I wanna be healthy and not eat it.
fatlogic,ffar613,t1_ffan3ip,1579742568.0,"Thank you :)
Yeah I didn’t think of it till my friend mentioned it. It’s great when it’s not busy but sucks when the mall is packed."
fatlogic,ff9tql4,t3_esd9hw,1579721075.0,"Woke up still at my highest weight in a few years. No more excuses, life is back to a normal. Time to get back on it. I noticed I’ve replaced my good habits with bad ones over the last few months. Time to readjust. 

Went to the gym the last two days in a row and feel really good about. I didn’t want to go this morning and yet I did! Also the mall I work at is less crowded now that holidays are over and that means I can walk around the mall on my lunch without getting MORE stressed from the walk. (If it’s crowded and I walk around it drives me crazy and makes me aggravated.)"
fatlogic,ff71sfn,t3_ervuu1,1579639419.0,"Rant: I am so mad at myself. I keep eating foods I KNOW are bad for me. Then I wake up and wonder ""why do I feel like shit?"" So I really need to stop doing this to my poor body. I already eat pretty healthy and workout so why do I eat foods I know that cause me pain? (Real reason is they're good and I'm not in pain for about a week...) Anyway, that means I have to give up dairy and be 100% gluten free. My boyfriend is upset I'm giving up dairy. He knows I'm lactose intolerant but I just haven't been feeling good and so he's upset cause he feels like this means he can't eat dairy. For example, if he wants a milkshake I'm going to say no now and he's upset because even though he can get one he doesn't want to feel like a fat ass being the only one getting one. 

Rave: got back on track yesterday and today. Went back to the gym, finally got my membership back, and going grocery shopping to get healthy food. Also I have decided to change my goals around with fitness. I've always wanted to get to 125lbs. No reason than it just seems like a nice number. Well....while I plan to lose my holiday weight/vacation weight I think I will shift my goal to just getting stronger, being more consistent, and toning up despite the scale. 

Rant 2: WHY DOES LIFTING WEIGHTS MAKE ME SO HUNGRY OMG. I ate a meal just now with 50g of protein and yet I still want some more food."
