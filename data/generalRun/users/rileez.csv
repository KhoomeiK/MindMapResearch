I was more on the page as if they were able to do something similar without actually pulling the organ from something that's remotely alive. But alive enough to grow the organs. But them working on a way to grow just the organs sounds much more ethical like you said but how they can do that without an actual brain to ""mother"" it will make that pretty fascinating.

NoContract,ffbcwn3,t1_ffa5zlu,1579760062.0,I've been looking into Visible myself and that unlimited 5mbit capped hotspot is looking mighty tasty to me being I'm going to be on the road a lot as a digital nomad. MVNO or not it's still Verizon and Verizon has always been good to me. And not really worried about customer support on my part being that I can usually resolve my own issues unless it's on the networks side obviously. So hopefully Visible will be a company that is here to stay their unlimited hotspot plan without getting crazy expensive.

But in all honesty I'd rather smell that over the bad B.O. that some of the inmates had. Some of them I don't think liked the idea of having to shower in jail. This is funny because I came across my little stick of ""deodorant"" they gave me in jail when I was going thru stuff the other day."
