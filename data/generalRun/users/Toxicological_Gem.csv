SeasonalAffective,ffp8lmw,t3_eu9255,1580088923.0,"The sentence ""other people have it worse than you"" is so dismissive and I've found it making me feel worse about myself/situation than if someone had said nothing. A coworker of mine made the comment on veterans day that some of the vets had lost arms/legs and they where still happy. He said that you can't really be sad about your own life because you have all your limbs and that other people have it worse than you. This was during a meeting, I had been having a shit week and started to cry on the spot. How dare I be depressed when my body is fine and I have a job. It's not like mental health is a thing at all to some people. It's fucking crazy to me"

EmKay,ffp7icv,t1_ffn9aob,1580088173.0,"Billie has revealed that she did actually struggle with her mental health and still does but her music helps her (js). Not all of her music is sad but people listen to music that has energy similar to what they're feeling. When I was a teen I listed to Pierce the Veil, Bring me the Horizon and lots of Breaking Benjamin. I was also really in a downward spiral then. It's not the music that makes people feel that way, they may already feel that way and the music makes them feel like someone else gets it.

I'm not a science or anything, but it's well researched and you can find a lot more about it online."
EmKay,ffp6sw1,t3_eu6l0p,1580087676.0,"Actually I wasn't depressed until I hit puberty at 11. Long crazy ride since then. Still a sad sack but I work on it when I've got the energy. I really do think depression is more common in the youth, but there is also lots of people who say ""I'm depressed/anxious/bipolar"" without having ever talked to a therapist or GP.

Mental health struggles are normalized and wildly accepted which is great, but I wish it wasn't. Being actually depressed/anxious/bipolar isn't normal, it's hell to live with, it's been romanticized by everyone from children to adults that I think people tend to forget that it can destroy someone's life. I wish saying ""I'm so depressed"" would be phased out. 

Poor mental health isn't something you want. Poor mental health isn't cute.

I know this post is a joke to highlight on people who say that they're depressed but I just have been wanting to say this for a while."

forbiddensnacks,ffp5gdu,t1_ffnd2w0,1580086716.0,I feel the same. I hate feet with a passion I ALWAYS have socks on. I don't go swimming because I hate feet so much (also I can't swim too well but having a stranger's feet touch you is disgusting)
Catswithjobs,ffnieq7,t3_etfomr,1580066335.0,"I watch a YT channel of a woman who owns 4 cats that will beg to be let into the dryer. She will put in some clothes, run it so it's toasty then let them hang out for a bit. She had mentioned that she ALWAYS checks the dryer and I imagine does a head count before starting it up. Just be careful :)"

Stadia,ffincyg,t1_ffin9xh,1579978020.0,I usually watch at 1080 at 60 frames but usually I have to drop to 720 or 480 when that happens. I don't know what the speed is specifically though
Stadia,ffimrk8,t1_ffimmcz,1579977607.0,In internet is.. okay? If my mom is streaming HBO and my sister is using Nexflix and I'm watching a Twitch stream I have to lower quality significantly for the stream to come through. Would that be a problem?
Stadia,ffik9hj,t1_ffijzu2,1579975880.0,"Don't worry, I've looked into it on my own as well but hearing from those who actually own the darn thing seems like a solid bet. With that 4K thing though I've found stuff on both sides saying Google didn't say it and that Google did. Tbh I don't care about 4K but getting a straight answer would be great because if they did lie I'd be less inclined to purchase."
juul,ffd9xy3,t1_ffd9gcb,1579816324.0,"Good good, I can understand the want to pull stuff apart to clean and do maintenance but Juul has a great customer service, if your device isn't working at 100% they'll replace it for you. Maybe contact them with some pics and your story and let them know that it's a common practice. Hopefully they'll let out a psa or something to let more people know that they're good with replacing the device."

trichotillomania,ffblnmm,t3_eropcl,1579771420.0,"When I was a teen I read a book with a girl who pulled out her eyelashes. Towards the end of the book she had escalated to burning her eyelashes off and the main character of the book was describing how beautiful she looked without eyelashes because her eyes seemed so bright and big without dark eyelashes. They then went on to describe the way tears rolled down her face and it was crazy romanticized. I don't pull my eyelashes, but I imagine if I did reading this would drive me to do it more."
trichotillomania,ffblbb7,t3_epi5x6,1579770898.0,I would pull the hair off my fingers and thinking more now when I was young my sister would pick on me because some of my nose hair stuck out of my nose and I had peach fuzz on my upper lip. I don't pull nose hairs/peach fuzz as often anymore but if I've picked my prime areas clean I'll go to my nose/upper lip when I'm really distressed.
juul,ffbg53r,t3_er5ac4,1579763808.0,"Hun. Can I first say, I'm glad you're okay. Secondly, you're right, that was really fucking stupid of you. Don't EVER take apart batteries they can, and in your case will explode. They can be testy little bitches for no reason other than like the temperature in the room. Stop taking juuls apart. Stop taking juuls apart, stop taking juuls apart.

Edit: originally I ended my comment with ""please be more careful,"" but after reading your replies - JUST BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE DO IT DOESN'T MEAN ITS A GOOD IDEA. You're lucky you didn't burn yourself and your house down."
juul,ffbftwm,t1_ff4vmmc,1579763422.0,"Just saying. I bought a pack of these and they tasted how spray paint smells. Leaked all over the place, the plastic seemed flimsy, it oxidized in like a day and something I've never experienced in an on brand pod, the coil burned. Gave off that classic burnt marshmallow taste of an over heated coil/burnt cotton. Be weary, I wouldn't recommend for long term use."
juul,ffberyg,t3_es804q,1579762165.0,"Honestly you're better just stopping cold. Throw away your juul/break it. Toss any and all pods, full or empty and just go for it. If you're athletic every time you feel the need just go jog, do some push ups. Nicotine is very hard to quit and weaning yourself off is going to lead to just as much frustration as just stopping. I wish you the best of luck dude!"
juul,ffbemtd,t3_es2doy,1579761997.0,"Tbh I switched from mint to menthol after the ban and it literally took me one pod to adjust to the taste. Now those tobacco flavors, no. I cannot."
juul,ffbeitu,t1_ff9p9ll,1579761869.0,"Those are 100% unregulated meaning they could have any kind of stuff inside. Look up some videos on YT or even check out this subreddit, there are videos and pics of people taking those apart. They have loads of cotton soaked in 'eliquid' I recommend doing some research all over the web before buying/using one. If you're really desperate get a cheap mod at a smoke shop and they can explain to you easy peasy how to use/maintain it. Only buy juices from a smoke shop or a legit/well know site and or brand. You don't want to fuck around with what you're putting into your lungs"
juul,ffbe6si,t3_es90rd,1579761490.0,"They're mad at juul for making pod systems mainstream really. Kids definitely vape, I had a whole smok mod at 17 with a wide array of juices, no peep from the FDA. Suddenly Juul pops up and makes vaping more easy, more discreet and way more tasty without having to fuck with batteries, leaking liquid and glass tanks. That convince is more what got kids/younger teens into vaping. Personally I blame the parents to an extent but at the same time you gotta put some blame on the kids.

Kids use to smoke packs a day but you didnt see cigs getting pulled from the shelf, but now kids are vaping and everyone is throwing a fucking fit. Shits wild to be honest and really doesn't add up in my mind. Kids will do whatever they think will make them seem cool or more grown up that be driving under age, drinking under age smoking/vaping/dippin' underage. 

I say let the adults pick their poison, if a 21 year old wants to waste money (myself included) on cigs/vape/dip, let them, but if a shop worker is even under the impression that they're pawing their shit off it underagers they should be allowed to flat say no sale and kick them out. Kind if a rant/tangent but I've been wanting to say all this for a while."

starterpacks,ff9riaa,t1_ff92vpf,1579719523.0,"Hey I never said it was a good idea, my grandmother is stupid religious and doesn't believe in birth control. My grandmother and grandfather had 9 kids before my grandpa got a vasectomy without telling her. My dad is the oldest of the 9 and the youngest is a few months older than me, I'm 21.

I'd also like to note that of the 9, 3 where girls and 2 of those girls had kids before they finished highschool- because my grandma doesn't believe teens should be on birth control. Don't get me wrong I love my grandma, but she's a little old-fashioned."
