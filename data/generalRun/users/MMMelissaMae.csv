Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,feit4jy,t3_epdcvl,1579146522.0,"Bad luck - I was fired from a job that I had for 6 years for a completely BS reason. 

Good luck- I took a year off from working to decide what I really wanted to do with my life.  Now I am enrolled in school again and 1 year away from getting my masters.  My new employer is actually encouraging of me getting a higher degree and I am able to complete a lot of my school work while on the clock.  Yes I make 30K less than I used to, but once I graduate I will command a steady 6 figure salary. 

I also recently found out that my old coworkers who lied to HR and got me fired, were fired less than a month after me for “tardiness”. ( I used to cover for them). And my positive coworkers who helped me through my transition are now leaving the company because corporate will no longer promote from within.  Sales is fun but working 11+ hr shifts every weekend every holiday gets old fast. 

So it has to be said that sometimes bad luck can lead to good luck. It’s all about your outlook and what you make of it."
KarmaCourt,feira68,t1_feilgxr,1579145220.0,"I agree.  People that are kind enough to give money to complete strangers in the hope that they will be paid back should have a way to weed out fake scam accounts.   1K karma + a 90 day account seems quite lenient to me tbh. 

And if everyone has to abide by the same rules... how is the policy discriminatory? 

This isn’t a case worthy of karma court."

We met after about a month and then become official the following February.   It will be a year together this coming feb, and my best advice is to be in an LDR with someone that you have lot in common with.  So whether you gaming, watching movies, or on the phone, you always have something to talk about.   Oh and always plan out the next time you will see each other while you are still hanging out."
