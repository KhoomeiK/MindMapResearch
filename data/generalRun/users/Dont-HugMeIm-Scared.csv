For example in dollars would not even be theoretically possible since there are other currencies worth far less than dollar which would make for much smaller steps again.

MonsterHunterWorld,ff4qo51,t1_ff4q8pv,1579570124.0,What I would like would be some kind of challenge mode in which you have to kill monsters in the arena in a certain amount of time. If you cart maybe once or twice it‚Äòs over and you can not go to the tend and get new potions etc. But maybe you could carve items from monsters. The longer you last the stronger monsters come and the better the rewards at the end. This way everyone could enjoy the challenge.
MonsterHunterWorld,ff4pwre,t3_ern3h7,1579569597.0,"I think it‚Äòs still too easy in the endgame and actually was harder through mid master rank. The fact alone that you can cart as often as you want in guiding lands I really dislike. So I don‚Äòt really know what difficulty you are speaking of. Especially with skills like fortify (what where they thinking) and vitality +3 (this skill is so overpowered and makes any other defensive skill look like a joke) it really is not difficult once you learn how to play the game, which most people should have learned considering they played through low high and master rank.

Making it harder would also not be good for the reason of casuals etc who are important to the game just like veterans and tryhards, but it would have been nice to have some sort of system to hbe the really really proficient players challenged while giving them more rewards for it. Right now if you are a veteran and really want a challenge you need to create it yourself with trying to be as fast as possible. But I would like quests that are so difficult you would have to actually bring all of the utility the game offers, which would include specific skills and strategies. 

Mhfu was a lot better in that regard - for me at least."
MonsterHunterWorld,ff3e92c,t1_ff3aw9j,1579539306.0,Same. And not just a guiding lands monster. I don‚Äòt know why but guiding lands does not build the same hype as a quest for me. Maybe that‚Äòs just me though..

MonsterHunterWorld,fen6hkf,t1_fen5yiu,1579278036.0,Thanks but I know these sets. All I was saying that I think it‚Äòs very unbalanced how bow got treated with these sets.

MonsterHunterWorld,fejf78b,t3_epgsyx,1579171251.0,"If you play charge blade do not go for a 5 piece set. Get a mixed set. CB loses on too many great damage skills in my opinion. To play cb to it‚Äòs full potential you should really have a few core skills besides the classics WEX and Crit eye.
Those are artillery +3, focus +3, guard +1 and offensive guard (at best +3)."

MonsterHunterWorld,fejdvty,t1_fejda50,1579169256.0,Don‚Äôt blame him . He might be new to mh series and never looked at speedrunners or meta.
MonsterHunterWorld,fejdlbd,t3_epgu0t,1579168818.0,"Well I mean, you probably know what‚Äòs gonna come, no? First of all, it‚Äòs obviously not a bad set. But it‚Äòs very much not optimized. It‚Äòs lacking many of the big core skills. 
You have critical boost +3 but no tenderizer (which is kind of painful). Then you are lacking in the artillery department and also have no guard +1, which is the minimum and considered a must in order to play charge blade to its full potential.
By the set you made I expect you aren‚Äòt hustling to get cracy kill times and the survivability is nice so if you think u do enough damage my only recommendation is to get maybe guard +3 and guard up (for some matchups) and really get down with deez guard points my man. Also no focus is sad. 

And sure, the CB itself and the fact it‚Äòs not a mixed set is kinda meh, but if it brings you joy, go at it!

Oh and offensive guard... that one is almost a must at least 1 level if not for the damage then for the joy of that rewarding feeling."

MonsterHunterWorld,feemf6l,t1_feem3am,1579036709.0,You dont get it. Your argumentation contradicts itself. You think if you burn through 20 mega you need to learn the monster better. That‚Äòs what I think aswel. But that‚Äòs why it was better to fail a quest if you used to many heals instead of being able to restock.
MonsterHunterWorld,feelw4o,t1_feekpkv,1579036402.0,It‚Äòs not about the mega potions. It‚Äòs especially about max potions. Back then you needed to save your two max potions for possible faints. Now you can use two max potions and even an ancient potion with every life (or even more if you go back to the tent but nobody does that lol)
MonsterHunterWorld,feelm2s,t1_feeksv4,1579036240.0,Which is exactly my point. In mhfu you often had to fail a quest several times before you finally made it. In iceborne I would have surely failed a few quests if I couldnt have restocked evwry time I fainted (+ fortify). Winning a hunt with fortify * 2 and two restocks feels not really rewarding. I think it was nicer when you had to admit on new monsters that it just won‚Äòt happen this time and you needed to go at it again until you really learned the monster.
MonsterHunterWorld,feek1kk,t1_feejx0p,1579035327.0,Yes guard up is a must on some matches. That‚Äòs true.
MonsterHunterWorld,feejwfi,t1_feejeqd,1579035244.0,Uff that sucks dude. You should google it. Maybe there is a way?
MonsterHunterWorld,feejodz,t1_feej1md,1579035115.0,Yes on some fights I go for guard +3 charm instead of handicraft charm ( only on a few monsters). Other than that fortify is enough. I play mostly solo and if I ever happen to faint twice it boosts defence and attack so much that it‚Äòs hard to actually fail a quest. But I guess it varies with experience.

MonsterHunterWorld,febp3ig,t1_fea91xf,1578961199.0,For example slinger against wall. If you are experienced also openings in which you know you will be able to trip the monster from the attacks of a initially smaller opening like exhaustion.

MonsterHunterWorld,fea8jmj,t1_fea7uex,1578945628.0,Well if you go savage axe you have high consistent damage. If you SAED you have one massive wave of damage but then have to recharge phials/reposition. That‚Äòs why a opening long enough for a4-6 phial savage axe spam then beats saed.
MonsterHunterWorld,fea7ps9,t3_eo8x2t,1578945340.0,There are some very insightful speedrun by Akantorex in YouTube. Watch them. He mostly uses SAED but when the opening is very big he goes for savage axe.
