ABA,ff4dh4g,t3_erh81y,1579561020.0,Be honest with your supervisors about any concerns you have with a case or if you feel you need more supervision. You are not effective as a tech if you are not confident in the procedures and interventions being used.
BehaviorAnalysis,fezzjkb,t1_f90jjvf,1579463572.0,Which company is this?
aww,fem01yb,t1_felfku4,1579235466.0,Same!
tippytaps,felmrha,t1_fekrvdh,1579225900.0,So adorable!
IllegallySmolDogs,fek3yhi,t3_epl9a3,1579192103.0,"Is this an alternative to the cone? If it is, I love it!"
GreatBritishBakeOff,fejxdvj,t1_fejwt4l,1579188029.0,"Maybe they focused on it because she was relatively shorter than the Paul, Prue, and Noel. I agree with you though... she doesn’t seem all that short."
ABA,fe6i6rg,t1_fe6cbbw,1578891676.0,Great advice!! I will remember this when that time comes! And I can’t imagine driving in huge city traffic. Do you ever supervise RBTs via videoconference? Could that cut out some of that travel time?
ABA,fe6i10o,t1_fe6erpf,1578891530.0,"Ugh, I’m sorry! That sounds awful! It also sounds like the way they are running things will surely impact the care the client receives. I’m glad you are getting the opportunity to work in a clinic-based company."
ABA,fe69wdt,t1_fe66q2s,1578885049.0,Thank you so much for the encouragement! I cannot say how relieving that is. I see a lot of discouraging posts on here so this is exactly what I needed to hear.
ABA,fe66neg,t1_fe6377i,1578882977.0,That’s relieving. I can’t imagine how much overall work time that would look like.
ABA,fe65yu5,t1_fe63aps,1578882543.0,Good to know!
ABA,fe65xeo,t1_fe61kww,1578882517.0,I am quickly realizing this! I am working my first school case as a tech and the last group left a bad taste in the teachers' mouths so they are very wary of me.
ABA,fe65tg5,t1_fe613ct,1578882446.0,Good to know!
ABA,fe622x7,t1_fe60ewb,1578880046.0,"Good information! I appreciate it. For BCBAs billing 30 hours a week, how many cases does that usually average out to be? It seems like it would be tough to hit 30 hours for contractors."
ABA,fe5vlz6,t1_fe5uhm2,1578875939.0,"Thank you so much for such a thoughtful reply! I appreciate that more than you know! BCBAs seem to wear many hats. What you do actually sounds so interesting to me. I have always loved training people and I think that is why being a BCBA appealed to me so much. I love behavior analysis and I love teaching. How did you find your way into this position? Did you reach out to the school district or was it through a company who has BCBAs in schools? This sounds a bit like PBIS. 

I appreciate your ""if I could go back"" advice. I am actually participating in some research right now and I find it fascinating. I think in the future I would love to focus on research."
Professors,fe5smjb,t1_fdpfw8k,1578874051.0,"Exactly. One of the first questions I have when I see a paper is due is how many pages it has to be. If I don’t see it in the syllabus or assumed appropriate folder, I contact the professor. A hard-working student would know this and would have also written this email. His mom should not have had to make this effort. However... all of this could have been avoided by contacting you beforehand."
ABA,fe58oq0,t1_fb4w78o,1578866605.0,Congrats! Did you pass??
ABA,fdolg76,t3_eme5cd,1578607537.0,"I’ve been in this situation. The main problem was that appropriate transitions were never reinforced because they weren’t happening. This client loved water play so we got a spray bottle of water to reinforce approximations of the transition. We started with colored circles placed every 3-ish feet and state “first circle, then water”. We would spray the client’s hands and legs to allow the client to experience a form of water play. After three consecutive days of meeting 80% or more independent transitions we would spread the circles further apart. To differentially reinforce a full appropriate transition, the client would get to actually play with the spray bottle if all approximations were independent. 

Also... a visual time and transition warning worked well."
MadeMeSmile,fdn6494,t1_fdmxsr5,1578578330.0,"Yes! I even do this over time. It could be two years later, but I might send a text to someone to remind them how much I appreciate their gift."
bernesemountaindogs,fdjvt2r,t1_fdjurun,1578489145.0,So adorable!!!

bernesemountaindogs,fdioez8,t1_fdhh6ru,1578447432.0,I need to see these knee high socks!!
ABA,fdgsdsr,t3_el68zn,1578407102.0,Someone told me they copied the task list to a word document and under each task item they included the Cooper definition.
ABA,fdgs4wr,t3_el4p2t,1578406917.0,"Are you RBT or BCaBA/BCBA? If the latter, maybe switch to contract work. Work fewer days per week or fewer hours per day."
FitnessMotivation,fdekzuy,t3_ekv0my,1578341254.0,Good luck! Don’t let anything deter you!
goldenretrievers,fdei2ko,t1_fde73el,1578339485.0,Am golden.
ABA,fd98jk2,t3_ek4i0t,1578229958.0,"Teaching a child to stay close to their guardian while crossing the street may be taught by providing a first-then statement with the end goal being a fun toy. Who cares? We need to teach the child to stay close because it is for their safety. We are not providing electric shocks to our clients. 

Part of the BCBA task list goes over client dignity and allowing them to make decisions about their own treatment. Even if it is as small as allowing them to choose which item they’d like to earn or choosing when they’d like to work on the “stay close” task. We are not focusing on silly stuff. If ABA was anything like what this video is stating I would not want to be a part of it. 

I hate that ABA’s ugly start has left such a bad taste in people’s mouths. I’m not saying I don’t get it. If I was not invested in this field I might be opposed to ABA too. I just hope that this field’s reputation turns around."
FitnessMotivation,fd5rj27,t3_ek3h44,1578180681.0,What is OMAD? Great work!
toptalent,fcvc5fk,t1_fcv8u73,1577999010.0,Thanks for pointing that out. I see what you mean now. I’m not sure any amount of springboard would get me up that high and on my feet. Ha!!
MadeMeSmile,fcuks6k,t1_fch66ou,1577983206.0,Yes! This! Google translate is my enemy for this reason. Haha!
toptalent,fcu1q1k,t1_fctkenl,1577969646.0,Look in the glass behind him. There’s no springboard. And right before he jumps his feet  are on the ground.

MadeMeSmile,fciw4v5,t1_fcip1ea,1577671238.0,So true. Hind sight is 20/20 and they have a lot of hind sight.
AnimalsBeingDerps,fcivtdi,t3_ehd2d8,1577671019.0,Reminds me of that toy always in the front of the toy store. That weasel attached to the ball.
MadeMeSmile,fcivm3s,t1_fciut62,1577670884.0,That’s so awesome!
BehaviorAnalysis,fcivazb,t3_ehebna,1577670673.0,"I don’t have an answer for you (sorry), but I actually have a question for you. When you went part time, how many direct hours were you able to bill for?"
MadeMeSmile,fcfusxi,t1_fcdqmp5,1577633934.0,"I used to work with the sweetest girl! She did this a lot, but I honestly thought it was so adorable! I did help her with phrases when I could because she wanted to get better at her English phrases. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have because I knew what she was trying to say. I am trying to learn Spanish and I am quickly realizing that so many phrases to not directly translate into the phrase you intend. I’m trying though!"

MadeMeSmile,fc32cp0,t1_fc2ougp,1577379843.0,I can’t think about it very long before getting emotional. Thank you so much for loving your sweet boys. I wish more people were open to adoption. Congrats on your boys and your nephews ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️

MadeMeSmile,fc1qtxv,t1_fc1nv9n,1577326808.0,"Did you go through the US? I am in the US and have heard that our process is so difficult that many choose to go through international adoption. While I believe any adoption is good, I feel like we have so many children in US foster care that need a good home. It seems like such an overwhelming process, but it’s beautiful. Thank you for sharing your beautiful family ♥️"
HumansBeingBros,fby3x24,t3_ef35cv,1577207486.0,I love the idea of animal daycare! So many of us work so many hours and the animals are just at home alone :(
