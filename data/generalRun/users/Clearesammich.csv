CFB,fehrdwl,t1_fedmfmh,1579122362.0,"Doubt it. We've still got Trevor and alot of our key pieces coming back next year. (Yes I know Trevor had a really bad game Monday. Terrible time to have a bad game, but him and fields are clearly the two most skilled QBs going into next year.) Now what happens after Trev leaves is anyone's guess."

AskReddit,fdrbvvj,t1_fdqji34,1578682288.0,"Ryobi knows how to make an electric tool, be that either battery powered or corded. Ive seen so many mixed reviews for their gas powered line that I'll stay away from that. But I'm still using a drill my parents got me for Christmas in 2000. They still use the exact same battery design as they did in the 90s. Its been the best tool I would recommend for a DIY homeowner. If you are going to be using the tools professionally I would probably go with Milwaukee or one of the other Pro grade brands. But for homeowners Ryobi is great."
