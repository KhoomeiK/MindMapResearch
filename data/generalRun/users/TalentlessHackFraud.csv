Australian humour is the same set up but the context is just ""people are pathetic and it's just funny, you can have a good laugh about it and move on""

1. Backburning: This is during an actual fire to burn out tracts of forest before the main fire hits it. The conditions in Australia this summer would have made that an extremely foolish thing to do as the fire would immediately burn out of control, and all resources were in the main fires

2. Hazard reduction: Burning or otherwise removing fuel during winter. Similar to 1, this wasn't an option in Australia this year as the winter was too short and hot, and a hazard reduction burn could have easily turned into a fully blown fire

Also on top of this conditions were very dry and Eucalyptus explode with burning oil. Fire Service leadership have said all evidence points to climate change being responsible for longer fire seasons, shorter windows for hazard reduction  and dangerously dry conditions"

 I don't agree with much Germaine Greer says these days, but she started to get her feminist academic chops by drinking in Sydney bars where women were banned, that's cool and takes courage. It wasn't her scheme to become a billionaire, she did it because it was nonsense and had both women and men friends who thought it was nonsense and supported her taking a stand. Now women can drink in bars. However the people that thought women shouldn't drink in bars are still around, have taught followers, and their followers have access to well funded media networks that their predecessors could only have dreamed of.

Social construct isn't a synonym for ""fake"" or ""forced"", it means a way of behaviour learned or taught for a purpose, basically everything you do in your life.

suggestmeabook,fe6v9jv,t1_fe6n3l6,1578906032.0,"The book is cool pulp fiction about Hannibal getting one more chance at survival and through convoluted plot machinations Starling becomes his life partner.

The movie somehow had the same plot skeleton but stripped out literally everything good about the book.

Also the Margot subplot in the book involves her friendship with Hannibal/Mason's nurse Barney, a massive powerlifter just like Margot (they meet by working out together), who otherwise in the book has a few ""butch"" traits like into sports cars etc. Barney tries to fuck her in the shower but she relatively diplomatically knocks him back. It's a fun subplot and kind of hot,and ultimately Barney completely capitulates to Margot's demand for Hannibal's mask because he's almost the reader surrogate and a relatively sane person in a world of dangerous psychopaths. The very last scene of the book is Barney accidentally seeing Hannibal and Starling (heavily altered by plastic surgery) at an opera, they stare straight back at him and he gets the fuck out of there and never looks back. It's kind of a hack ending but it's cool,fits with the pulp feel of the book.
