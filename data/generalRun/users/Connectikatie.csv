ChildrenFallingOver,ff399ru,t1_ff37zu2,1579536699.0,"Well, to give you more information than you would ever ask for, there’s a theory that comedy comes from people losing control of themselves. The idea is that in society we’re supposed to behave in certain socially acceptable ways and keep our bodily functions under control. When someone loses that control and can’t help falling, farting, hiccuping, etc, we find it funny because it’s a release from the rigidity of what we expect. That’s why slapstick has always been so popular. And children don’t have control over their bodies or know what it’s socially acceptable to say, so they are goldmines for this kind of comedy. Hence children falling over and “kids say the darndest things.” 

But as E.B. White said, “Explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog. You understand it better but the frog dies in the process.”"
