OP isn't wrong to want to NOT rug sweep the behavior enough to have him walk her down the aisle.  But it will cause a permanent alteration in her relationship with her mother.

LDH died end of January 5 years ago.  My health insurance covered his hospital stay, but I got a bill for $350,000.  (oh shit, oh shit, oh shit)  Insurance directly paid about 1/3.  Hospital wrote off a chunk more.  I was left with around $15,000 to pay, on my puny hourly income.  Because he'd been on long term disability, I got a 3 month check from them, and that nearly covered that $15,000.  

But THEN, I went to the tax guy in March, and he hadn't even filed for the tax year 2 years prior, so 'we' owed $11,000.  I sat at his table and howled, ugly cried, snot running, etc.  I could figure out how to pay it, plus the current year due, or file separately but have the IRS put a lien on the house.  I rage cried all the way home and threw my wedding band in the far corner of my bedroom.  I have never put it back on.

He also left 17 guitars.  List price quite a bit more than my tax debt, but of course selling second hand netted quite a bit less.  I got the tax debt paid.

5 years later, I'm still pissed that he left me with nothing but debt.  Many varied kinds of debt.  No savings, no life insurance, no nothing.  I'm barely above poverty level, and I'm sharing an apartment with my youngest daughter and her husband, and she's expecting, so it's going to get loud and crowded in a few months.
