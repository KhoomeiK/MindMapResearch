AskReddit,felvxtz,t3_epp36x,1579232282.0,"Log bar, 4 45lb Olympic weight plates, glute ham developer/reverse hyper, pulley system, and a dip belt.

The log bar for practicing the log press, which is in like, at least 60% of strongman competitions.  The extra weights because my max deadlift is heavier than what I have in my home gym, so new plates would allow me to max out at home.  Glute ham developer/reverse hyper because it's a wonderful tool for building, well, the glutes and the hamstrings.  The pulley system for cable rows and pulldowns, building up my lats, mixing it up from the usual pullups/DB rows/barbell rows.  The dip belt would allow me to add weight to my dips and pullups."
