AdviceAnimals,ff7bkmh,t3_eqmdxb,1579645625.0,"Anti Bribery and Corruption policies are bullshit. All it does is keeps you from making more than your paycheck. I mean honestly, a policy like that would make me MORE likely to disclose information to my companies competitors for bribes. Js"
worldnews,ff7atnu,t1_ff73l76,1579644933.0,Seems like it would benefit us to make our countries green and do away with the need for Saudi Arabian oil. Although i think we all know that wont happen any time soon. Greed is one of the biggest hindrances to progress.
worldnews,ff7an4e,t1_ff70d14,1579644772.0,"You almost have to feel bad for Iraq. The US government basically used them as a scapegoat so they could get at their oil after 9/11, then theyve had attacks from both the US and Iran carried out on their soil. Iraqs like that guy in a bar fight who wants no part in it but keeps getting punched anyway"
worldnews,ff7a6ao,t1_ff73vj3,1579644387.0,"Curious question, please dont downvote. I am admitting ignorance and asking for information.

With SA and the USA out of the UN, two of the largest countries in the world, does that jeapordize the UNs ability to prevent a World War?

Edit: no, please, dont productively answer the question. Just go ahead and keep downvoting you fucking morons."
worldnews,ff79y4z,t1_ff6wtg0,1579644200.0,"The title is misleading, if you read the article, it states that the USA as well as several European leaders are giving SA cover because its financially healthy for them to do so."
worldnews,ff79toa,t1_ff6u07j,1579644103.0,"This policy should apply to all nations honestly. I mean, how would we feel if we were kicked out of our homes because some other country hated us? We didnt do shit to them, but they hate our government and somehow thats enough. Thats ridiculous."

worldnews,ff2v300,t1_ff2tmai,1579525313.0,"Haha i love this comment string. Reminds me of Anti-Vaxxers. ""We have 50,000 experiments that show vaccines dont cause autism"" ""Well yeah, but wheres the proof? I read in this one article where a researcher in the 1950s said it did""

worldnews,ff2uqc3,t1_ff2tb5k,1579524928.0,"It amuses me how often the subject of other politicians vs Trump comes up, and its almost always when there is no viable defense for Trumps actions. Im a piece of shit, Hilary Clinton was a piece of shit, Mary Fallin (Oklahomas ex-Governor) was a piece of shit. The difference is, while Trump is ALSO a piece of shit, hes the piece of shit that represents the entirety of America to the world. So while i could sit here comparing Trump to all these other pieces of shit, it doesnt change the fact that Trump is the king of the pile of shit right now."

A) Does donating one of your kidneys put a lot of strain on your other kidney?

B) what causes so many kidney failures?"
worldnews,fep2a69,t1_fep1ieb,1579310531.0,"By that same logic, we shouldve been nuked for committing genocide on ourselves in the Civil War. Every country has an ugly history. Were just having to face ours in the here and now."

todayilearned,feimhe9,t1_feilwl0,1579141982.0,"Aww, was it that obvious? Clearly not since you literally spent the span of like, 3 hours going back and forth with me about it. I thank you though, you gave me a lot to think about and a lot to look forward to while i was working on my homework. Ill be honest. Im not gonna think about it, im probably going to move (i will absolutely send you a message when it happens ;*), but who knows. Could be in a year, could be in 5 years, assuming we all live that long. At any rate, this was enjoyable and it honestly made me feel at home in my new hometown (not overseas, i just moved to a different city for college). So thank you, and i honestly, no bullshit, hope you have a great night and a great day tomorrow."
todayilearned,feil6ir,t1_feiiwxn,1579141102.0,"Lol why are you so mad? Im gone. Fuck america. Id say id hope you enjoy your inevitable nukes under your cheeto president, but your imbreeding has already caused more genetic mutation than a nuke could ever cause. But hey, bet the fishing will be good. Maybe you can take your sister-wife down to the lake and do some rad-fishing. Also, just for the fun of it, im gonna need you to come up with more creative material if youre gonna keep trying to come at me. This schpiel is practically textbook right wing trumpist defense and its boring. Give me something new to work with. Tell me about how ""America will rise again"" and ""we are the greatest military nation"" etc etc. And anyone who doesnt believe you is a libtard snowflake blah blah blah. You and i can throw words at eachother all day, but its not doing us any good. Get more creative content or please stop boring me with your redneck drivel.

Also, sorry you had to wait so long. I got caught up watching youtube videos, and then i was like ""Oh yeah i was supposed to go see if that guy on reddit replied back"" and now here we are <3"
todayilearned,feiawbi,t1_feia5oc,1579134222.0,"Lol i blame hot water and thicker thumbs for that one. Although i will admit my spelling isnt what youd call 100% accurate. You can call me whatever you want lol. Its no skin off my bones. Dont like it? Too bad. I am just a bit curious though. Why are you so focused on me doing my damnedest (may be spelled right, may not be, whatever) to get out of the country? What does it matter to you? And so help me god if you say its because its ""your country"" and ""you dont want anybody who doesnt support patriotism here"", im gonna be a little disappointed. Cmon, there must be a reason. Talk to me. Ive got German homework but i can keep my phone on here if you want to talk about it.

Edited for obscenity. I shouldnt tell someone to go commit a major crime that would affect hundreds if not thousands of other people."
todayilearned,fei8fn9,t1_fei7io0,1579132601.0,"Ok, yeah, so i did say america was dangerous. Thats the only other thing youve proven. Other than you might be one of those tobacco chewing cousin fuckers. Thats still anyones game. Anyway whats your point? All youve proven is you can read, and youre having a fit because i dont want to live in your trashy country, but im also not gonna just leave illegally. So where are we at with this? You wanna keep trying to prove something? Are you gonna be that pathetic that you have to try and dig up dirt? Or are you gonna accept that i think americas party system and everything about the way its run is trash and we go on about our day? Cause honestly. Im having a good time with this. Im kicked back right now in a hot bath just waiting for your replies."
todayilearned,fei70s2,t1_fei5x9k,1579131699.0,"I havent made any claims, except that America is full of r-tards, your the one whose putting words in my mouth and throwing a tantrum, something you accuse your liberal counterparts of all the time. But please, continue, i am here to listen <3"
todayilearned,fei4omp,t1_fei42xz,1579130212.0,Lol youre pathetic. But in an amusing way. Like listening to politicians talk.

As far as the youtubers and panels, that stuffs free iirc. I used to go with my online friends every year up until 2018 so not sure if anything changed since then but i cant imagine it would change that much. If you have any other particular questions, please feel free to ask! I remember my first PAX, its hard to forget."

You just want what you want, even if it hurts everyone else, and you shit all over everyone who tries to talk down to you. Well guess what? Youre not hot shit. Youre just like me, a nobody from nowhere who wastes his time browsing reddit. The only difference between you and I is Im not a complete piece of shit. Im like 90% shit. You my friend are the whole fucking pile."
AdviceAnimals,fdv7bg3,t1_fdroz4j,1578744153.0,"Republicans?

I mean, im not a republican myself, but i honestly dont think the mans political affiliation has anything to do with not instating a holiday for elections. Now i could be completely wrong, probably am, and also half asleep. But its times like these i have to remember theres assholes on both sides of the party line, and the best thing we can do is put aside our political bias (Democrats vs Republicans is gonna be just as bad as North vs South) and remember that the government is buns."
worldnews,fdt4npl,t1_fdsjcma,1578711867.0,"This brings to mind an interesting question.
