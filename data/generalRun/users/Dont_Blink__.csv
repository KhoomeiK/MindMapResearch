BackToCollege,ffrbo4s,t3_eurneo,1580154708.0,"It depends on what kind of college you plan on transferring to. I know my college doesn't really care how many schools you went to previously, as long as your GPA is in line with their requirements. I, personally, wouldn't mention it unless they ask. But, if you're planning on going to a Big 10 or ivy league school, they may care.

college,ff3vhz0,t1_ff37uka,1579549752.0,"Ok, I’m going to throw in my two cents and bit of experience here. I didn’t go to college. I worked shit jobs until I was about 30 and then got laid off. I went to community college and got my associates. I then got another job that didn’t have anything to do with what I got my degree in. I then got a job through a temp agency that was somewhat related, but the degree wasn’t really necessary...that job lead to a much better job that was related to my degree. I’m now in the position that I had to go back to school to get my bachelors in order to advance. My current position is “Associate Engineer”, basically an engineer without the degree. I am back in school and working full time to get my degree in engineering. 

My point is, you aren’t going to get your dream job, or even something totally related to your field out of the gate. It’s like you take baby steps and then you gradually make it up to where you want to be. It took me 2 years to get to the sort of related job then another year to get the job I wanted, then another 4 at that company to get where I am now. Just be patient and look for something that requires related skills."

TalesFromYourServer,feymg1v,t1_fev1r88,1579447570.0,"First, I would argue you don’t pay they tips, you more pass them on. And second, $9000 a year is like $750 a month. If a business can’t cover that (and I’m assuming it’s also a tax deductible expense) then the business isn’t sustainable. I understand no one likes paying out extra money for anything, but a good business owner would chalk it up to an extra business expense and add it into their budget. If you put into perspective what the restaurant makes vs. what the server makes it’s a dick move for the owner to put it on the server to pay."

MiddleClassFinance,fck4wuh,t3_e8yc2y,1577716690.0,"I bought my house at the rock bottom of the market in late 2014/early 2015. I had $5000 saved for a down payment and opted for a 203K FHA mortgage. This allows for repairs and improvements to be rolled into your loan if needed, but also loosens the typically ridiculous inspection requirements that usually go along with a normal FHA. The house I picked had been on the market as a forclosure for about 4 years. Three other people had tried to buy it before me, but their loans fell through. The list price was $68,000 and it needed a new furnace, A/C, and water heater (quoted for $6800, which was rolled into the loan), but it appraised for $105,000. The main appeal of the house was that it was in the city and area of the city I wanted to be in. 

The next year I refinanced with a conventional loan and had enough equity that it got rid of the PMI. It currently appraises for about $170,000 and I haven't really made any improvements, that's just from the market rebound. 

At the time I bought I was working as a long term contract employee making about $37K a year. I didn't have any credit card debt, but did have about $20K in student loan debt. My mortgage, including taxes and insurance, is about $740/month."
