bipolar2,ff95py1,t3_es28d1,1579705467.0,I want nothing more in life than a stabilized mood chart. Amazing mate!
DoesAnybodyElse,ff1buq8,t3_eqxx2g,1579477276.0,Well I’m bipolar so yes I attend these sessions often depending on what my brain has in store for me that week/month/year - really keeps me on my toes and in my bed lmao
bipolar2,feefdes,t3_eopi2z,1579032617.0,"That is all so hard and your breakdown is totally understandable. You do matter!!! As does your baby, but it is best to keep you stable enough to connect and love him when he is born. I am not a mom and panic about making that decision and what comes with it often, but it is admirable how you are still surviving and doing your best for you and your baby. Your fears of not connecting with your baby are totally valid, but from what you’ve shared is that you want that and care very much about him already. So even if that is a struggle you are capable of acknowledging it and taking the steps you need to keep you both healthy! 

Also allow yourself to think about the possibility that you don’t experience a severe depression after birth. Or maybe that once he is born you know what meds work for you and can be the kind of parent you want to be. These situations are probable too so try your best not to get stuck in the mindset that it will all be bad! You can get through this shitty time, and I’ll be thinking of you."
bipolar,fe4z2r9,t3_entduc,1578864169.0,"I’ve made the same changes, although I will drink occasionally but not much. The sleep schedule is very helpful for me and making sure I wind down before bed and do something relaxing for at least 30 mins rather than be on my phone or laptop has really helped me fall asleep. When I’m in a severe depression it is so hard for me to sleep (aka pure torture lol) but keeping this routine will at least help me a bit during those rough patches. Keep doing what your doing! It’s hard to make these changes, but worth it!"
bipolar,fdwm3bv,t3_en1nb9,1578760102.0,I LOVE this. Amazing work.
bipolar,fc12urm,t1_fc0rf19,1577306674.0,Quitting caffeine has helped me so much too!
bipolar,fc12rx5,t3_efhnhh,1577306610.0,That’s fantastic!!! It can be really hard over the holidays. Luckily (or not so luckily) I have a cousin with schizophrenia so we are sober buddies. I only drink a glass of wine about twice a month and being sober most of the time has helped me so much!
bipolar,fbzo3bv,t1_fbz6qb7,1577253543.0,"That sounds terrible. My parents live in denial and will even kinda admit it, but the fact that yours verbalize those things to you is horrible. It’s sucks not having the support you need from your parents and really hurts. I hope that when you do go back that you can take care of yourself despite their lack of understanding/empathy."
