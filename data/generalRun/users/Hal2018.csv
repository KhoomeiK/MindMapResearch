This is not messing up. You are on the right track. You are noticing your how easily it is to get caught up in thought. If you are getting frustrated, then you are not practicing nonjudgement and nonreactivity during your meditation. Here is what should be happening in mindfulness meditation: TheÂ five facetsÂ are observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience.

The point? 1)To develop insight into how your mind works and how suffering arises. 2) To reduce emotional avoidance of inner experience (i.e, cultivate acceptance of what is) 3) To cognitively defuse from absorbtion in thought (i.e, gain skilful distance between awareness and thought). These skills will help you overcome barriers that prevent you from living a full life because a lot of the barriers are simply an unwillingness to experience whatever is in the mind.

The point is not thought suppression (your reference to not thinking about cats), The point is to accept whatever is."

I am not sure what meditation you are practicing, but here is a pointer. Attempts to calm your mind are simply attempts to control your mind. Mindfulness meditation, if that is what you are practicing, is not about controlling your thoughts and feelings.  It's about accepting whatever arises. This undermines emotional avoidance. At the same time, acceptance isn't getting absorbed and lost in thought. When you focus on the breath, you will notice your mind will wander. Noticing this is meditation. When you notice this, go back to the breath. You will do this continually  throughout your session.  This is cognitive defusion. When you do not emotionally avoid and defuse, one day you will become aware of your true self. :)

I like Alan Watts. I love listening to him. However, listening to him is not really meditation. It is more like contemplation and often contemplation can make us feel good. However, as with all things, contemplating what Alan Watts says will feel good for a while, but it will wear out and pleasure will no longer be derived. This is why meditation in the pursuit of pleasure isn't very useful. Meditation that is focused on  acceptance of whatever there is, insight,and learning how your mind works will have greater benefits.  However, you may want to consider loving-kindness meditation. Practice mindfulness some days and loving-kindness meditation other days."

Causation is pragmatically true to a point, but it's not entirely true from the standpoint of correspondence truth.

Water comes from the interaction of hydrogen and oxygen, yet water has qualitative properties that are quite different from both hydrogen and oxygen.

See that is the trick. Mindfulness is not absorbtion in negative inner experience. Acceptance is observing from some distance, with nonjudgement, and nonreactivity no matter what is present. It is making room and being willing to live with some discomfort. Avoidance and escape toward inner experience maintains anxiety.

However, mindfulness alone will not relieve you from anxiety. Behavioral exposure therapy/work is also required because it is avoidance and escape behavior that reinforces and regards reinforces and maintains anxiety.

A system is required to address anxiety, not just mediation. See Acceptance & Commitment Therapy for Anxiety disorders by Eifert and Forsyth. No one is going to get you out of anxiety but you.

Were there not, O monks, this unborn, unoriginated, uncreated, unformed, there would be no escape from the world of the born, originated, created, formed.

In problem solving, there is more emphasis on attention. Attention focuses strongly on an object and gets absorbed. In mindfulness, you do not want to get absorbed. Absorbtion is fusion. You want more awareness and less attention. Scan your field of consciousness and do the following: 1) observe, 2) describe (that's a thought, that's a feeling, that's a memory, that's an imagination)) This is going meta, 3) observe non judgementally, 4) Do not react (do not try to suppress, avoid or escape what is present), 5) act with awareness (when you get entangled and absorbed in the content of thought, pull yourself out and note it). Focus in the breathe for 5-10 breathes to defuse and untangle yourself.

Let your mind think what it wants. Do not suppress. Just watch it like you are watching a babbling brook it stream.

A word about contemplating motivation. You think you cannot move on because you are no longer getting admiration. I must tell you, this is just one story among many. The mind is good at creating stories about why we are where we are. Your mind has BOUGHT INTO this particular story, whether it be true or false. The reality is, whether it is true or false, IT does not matter. What matters is what always matters in our spiritual practice. How are you relating to this story? Have you forgotten the practice of mindfulness? Have you forgotten the practice of acceptance? What I mean by acceptance is not buying into your story, but simply making room for the story and the discomfort associated with it. Do not try to escape or avoid your inner experience, but keep relating to it in a mindful way, which is with nonreactivity and nonjudgment. Do not believe the story, but let it exist. 

The negative emotions and feelings you are experiencing now is a result of karma. I do not mean cosmic karma, but psychological and behavioral karma. Romantic relationships include a strong degree of attachment. Cravings are satiated over and over; there is continuous reinforcement with pleasure. Think of a romantic relationship being like a drug, albeit a much more healthy drug. When the relationship is removed there is suffering. Parts of your brain, which are outside your control seek satiation. This pining and craving will continue for a while. How long, I am not sure. A brain does not rewire in a day, especially when the attachment is strong and has been built up over a long time. It will take time. 

While your brain rewires, keep practicing mindfulness to help it along. Also, keep pursuing the things in life you value. The pursuit of value is the life blood of hope. It requires action and movement of the body. 

Rachel Collis states that values are: 

1. Values are â€˜desired qualities of behaviorâ€™. They are about who we want to be in the world. What sort of employee, manager, co-worker, friend, partner etc.

2. Values are not goals. Goals can be achieved whereas values are moment to moment choices. In this moment now, I can be curious but I can never achieve â€˜curiousâ€™.

3. Values are not rules.  They are qualities we choose freely. As soon as we start to feel we have to follow a value, it loses all itâ€™s vitality. It stops being a value and starts to be a rule. In vital workplaces, people are happy to sign up for the organizational values. In workplaces lacking vitality, staff members follow the organizational â€˜valuesâ€™ because they will get into trouble if they donâ€™t.

4. Values are about my behavior not what I want to get from others.  In a recent moving post, Rob gave an example of a â€˜valueâ€™ that lacked vitality:

Values are found within the following domains: Family relations, physical well-being, citizenship, spirituality, recreation, education/personal growth/, marriage/couple/intimate relations, parenting, friendships/social relationships, employment. 

You can make room for the discomfort you are feeling and the pursuit of values. Don't give up and wallow in your misery. You will find another relationship, perhaps even a better one.

Mindfulness meditation is just the beginning in discovering your true nature, however, it is not enough. You need a system to develop insight, an existential or spiritual system.

So long as mediation coincides with practicing within a system like Buddhism, the differences would be quite stark.

In order to experience the benefits of meditation, willingness and acceptance of some discomfort is necessary. There is very little benefit in a 5 minute mediation. 20 minutes should be the minimum. However, if you are really this avoidant of discomfort, working your way up to 20 minutes may be necessary, but don't expect much.

You must go through a process of trial and error. You have to find your ""guru,"" a gateway through the veil of ignorance, which prevents you seeing God in all things. 

There are two general paths: 1) Devotion and worship with regard to the Otherness of God, or 2) Contemplation and meditation on the Self. Both lead to realization and union and union leads to radical acceptance of the way things are (i.e, there is annihilation of mind and body) and the extinguishing of craving for greater meaning and purpose. For me personally, I have chosen the latter. For background, I was once a Nihilist. 

Remember, religious beliefs are just symbols pointing to an experience of God. They are not the experience themselves. For an example of what I am talking about watch the bag in the wind scene in American Beauty. It conveys what the experience is like.

>Has anyone been able to use meditation for finding answers to what makes you happy? 

First, happiness is a goal, a state of mind. It is a consequence of skilful action in the world or luck.  

Second, meditation can produce happiness on its own, but meditation must serve a larger life direction to be truly effective. Discovering your life direction cannot be found in mediation. 

Last, it is found through contemplation, reflection, seeking guidance from those who know how to uncover values. 

Values are the compass for life and values can be found in the following domains:

1) Couples/intimate relationships
2) Family relations
3) Social relations
4) Employment
5) Education and training
6) Recreation
7) Spirituality
8) Citizenship
9) Health/physical well-being

Values cannot be attained; they simply provide general direction. They allow you to figure out goals and what concrete steps you need to take to attain goals within each domain. For more on this, see values work within Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. There are a ton of books and resources on it. Through values work, you can see what will likely bring mental state of happiness."

Well, in this case it kind of is the same thing, because I am talking from the psychological perspective of ACT, which has adopted many tenets of Buddhism. 

Would you agree that Ill-will is an unhealthy, dysfunctional behavior? Would you agree that ill-will is (i.e., emotional avoidance) and behavioral (i.e., avoidance and escape)?   

Craving is not a reinforcement in Buddhist psychology or ACT. Craving, is a deprivation, a drive seeking satiation. Craving manifests itself in behavior such as ill-will. When craving gets what it wants, it is satiated. In this case satiation involves a feeling, a relief or removal of negative feeling associated with deprivation. It is the act of satiation, the feeling, which reinforces ill-will. 

>So your goal is liberation and deeper connections with others. Is 'unconditional love' what you mean by liberation?

Buddhism,fdw91rc,t1_fdtd0an,1578756318.0,"> but I don't understand what continues if there is no soul, what is reincarnated, what collects karma?

I will assume you are aware of the five aggregates. Within the five aggregates there is consciousness. Think of consciousness like an onion with layers. Consciousness discussed within the five aggregates arises and ceases. It is a peripheral and a superficial layer of consciousness. It gets entangled with the other aggregates and produces suffering when the conditions are right. However, this isn't the only layer of consciousness. There are deeper layers. The deeper layers are more pure and there is no end to the depth (considered to be infinite). If you look into the practice of samadhi meditation, you will see that one of the jhanas is contemplating infinite consciousness. Karma is collected and stored in consciousness. When you think about it, consciousness is the final stop for all experience. Reincarnation/Rebirth: Infinite consciousness extends into and incarnates form. Below infinite consciousness is mystery that cannot be named."
Meditation,fdw3eqh,t1_fdvied3,1578754682.0,"\> because the only reason I practice is to help with my social anxiety. 

I had social phobia a long long time ago, when I was in high school. Fortunately, I intuitively worked myself out of it. Living away from my parents was probably helped the most. Anyway, it's great that you are studying and trying to use Buddhism to free yourself from social anxiety, however, you may want to consider using the book Acceptance & Commitment Therapy for Anxiety Disorders by Eifert, Forsyth, and Hayes as a supplement. ACT has adopted many of the Buddhist tenets and it explains that dysfunction anxiety in a very simple and understable way. The treatment is simple as well; reduce emotional and behavioral avoidance through acceptance and behavioral exposure. 

\>I have paranoia with anatta because of what it would imply if we had no self. 

I  understand what you are saying and it is a common misunderstanding of annata or no self. Again, the teaching of no self is not saying a self doesn't exist. It is telling you that identity and control does not exist in things that are impermanent. The five aggregates are impermanent so they serve as a poor identity and do not yield control. The Buddha says, ""the self is not this and not that to get you to realize and intuit this: 

 ""It is hard to realize the essential, the truth is not easily perceived; desire is mastered by him who knows, and to him who sees aright all things are naught. There is, O monks, an unborn, unoriginated, uncreated, unformed. Were there not, O monks, this unborn, unoriginated, uncreated, unformed, there would be no escape from the world of the born, originated, created, formed. Since, O monks, there is an unborn, unoriginated, uncreated and unformed, therefore is there an escape from the born, originated, created, formed."" 

What do you think he means here? :) Sure sounds like he is talking about something in you, something you overlooked and it gives you control. It's much deeper than the five aggregates. Keep looking. 

\> And then they tell me, oh by the way, you don't actually exist. 

You are right to question these people. The wording they use doesn't make sense. Annata or no self is not about what exists. We know the mind and body exist. What they should be saying is there is too much identification with the aggregates and this does not yield control. I imagine they use the extreme language to jolt your awareness into realizing what lies below annata. However, it isn't working, so they should lighten up the language a little."

>No, because ill-will doesn't come from a feeling, it comes from your attitude towards a feeling.
>""why do you want to uproot ill-will?"" 

Hmm...I would have to respectfully disagree, because my study of psychology tells me that, even though ill-will may not originate from feeling, feeling reinforces and maintains ill-will. 

>""why do you want to uproot ill-will?""

I want to uproot ill-will because it is one of the ten fetters and cessation of the ten fetters leads to total liberation. At the same time, the uprooting of ill-will will allow clear obstacles to deeper connections with others. This isn't an imagination, it is simply removing the impact of negative story on perception of people.  It's a way to show others unconditional love, no matter who they are. This all has to do with me and the mental state I would like to develop within 7 lifetimes. 

>Great, however if you remove your own craving for feelings, then helping people will be more effective.

The thing is, the craving is weak. You have to realize, I recently had a powerful experience with loving-kindness mediation. It was my first experience. It last for months. Very powerful at first, blissful, and then a of less intense love for all things and warmth from there after. Now, I am sliding into and maintaining equanimity. I can live without the feeling, but wow, what a high! 

With respect to the last mediation and waves of feeling, I just didn't understand if there was a unknown function to attending to the feeling that I may have been missing. I appreciate your engagement and  the reminder about not clinging to things that arise and cease. Fabrications generate them all and one should not cling to feeling states, no matter if they are jhanas or brahmavaras.  

Thank you. ðŸ™‚"
Buddhism,fdse17s,t1_fdsb9zv,1578700530.0,"Yes, I understand that. However, my question was related to the mechanical aspect of it. Would attention, not just awareness, on the feeling aid in the process of uprooting ill-will or focusing attention on the object and then feeling and then back to the object be the correct course of action? In other words, would attention on the feeling snowball the whole function of loving-kindness mediation or not? Or would just focus on the object do this? 

When I search my mind, I do not have any strong feelings of ill-will toward people classified as enemies. There is only slightly negative evaluation, in a cognitive sense. Anger is never uncovered in the process of contemplation or meditation of these people. I seek to bring them into a positive light. My worst enemy is probably Donald Trump, but even he doesn't bring me to anger over the last few months given my practice of Buddhism.

Anyway, I really like this meditation. It is much different than mindfulness or samadhi (jhanas focus). I think it will aid me in cultivating compassionate behavior toward others,  especially those who are in need."

I know what you saying about therapy. I was a therapist once. I counseled people using CBT and ACT. CBT is primarily about using a control strategy to attenuate suffering and dysfunction. It works within the self. There is a new therapy that has taken therapy beyond the self. It's Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and it is an acceptance strategy much like Buddhism. Really, it is Buddhism without the religious (relinking with the Source) focus. If you are interested in ACT, I wouldn't do therapy, but I would buy and read books and understand ACT in and out. Know it better than an ACT therapist and then relate what you discovered to meditation. You will find great benefit and growth in this. 

Also, take a tour of existential philosophy. You will find many Western philosophers diagnosed the human condition, however, it was only the Buddha who really knew how to deal with it. Knowing what is it there is good in that it gives you perspective and let's you know where you are at on the Path."
Meditation,fds9vtf,t1_fdrtavi,1578697706.0,"Your motivations are great! You are a very motivated for a youngster. ðŸ™‚ 

Do you think mediation alone will produce insight? I ask because, typically,  you need a system of wisdom to help give birth to insight. For example, deep insights into human nature are found within Buddhism, a psychological, ethical, and cosmological framework. Insight can also be found in psychotheraputic theories of mind and behavior. 

It is my view you aren't seeing the results you want because you do not have a system of wisdom to help you unlock insight. Once you have a system, you will progress.

Meditation,fds8lx9,t1_fdrl6um,1578696832.0,">In ""real world"" practice, or at least, when interacting with Western society, it seems that the doctrine of anatta as meaning ""no self"" is unhelpful, which leads me to question if it's true.

Hmm... Why do think the function of anatta is to be helpful when interacting with Western society? This is strange because the function of Anatta is not to be an aid with respect to interaction. The function of Anatta is to help individuals find the lever of control which allows them to extinguish clinging and attenuate unsatisfactoriness. 
Anatta has helped many Westerners find the lever, including myself. Anatta is mysterious and hard to understand from an intellectual perspective, but once you understand it phenomenologically, it is profound and really life changing. So, overall, I don't think Anatta should ever be ignored. It should be respected and discussed with those on the Path.

However, talking about it it trying to explain to those who have no understanding of the Path isn't very fruitful and you probably will sound crazy. 

Can you give more description of your paranoia. I am interested why you are experiencing paranoia with anatta.

What are theÂ Four Foundations of Mindfulness?

mindfulnessÂ of the body,

mindfulnessÂ of feelings,

mindfulnessÂ of mind, and,

mindfulnessÂ of Dhamma.

Mindfulness of the dhamma is the highest level and heightened awareness is more important than focus and absorbtion and there are big insights to be gained once you become aware the Dhamma in daily life. The transition to this level usually includes some powerful and blissful experiences. When you settle in to the higher level, you have a great deal of equanimity. 

Focus and absorbtion as you described it is definitely an exercise in attention and the more you do it the stronger you attention will become. However, within the spiritual context, focus and absorbtion become a means to experiencing the jhanas and brahmaviharas.

Describe this in more detail because it doesn't sound like anhedonia. Anhedonia is the inability to feel pleasure. 

You said you don't want to do things. That is an issue of motivation, not anhedonia. There is a component of motivation that may have been significant weakened. It's clinging. Clinging is a strong craving for something to be present or not be present. For a deeper understanding see Buddhism. 

With your mindfulness practice, you have seen a reduction in clinging. This is a good thing because now you are less reactive. However, you didn't realize you have grown and reached a higher level of awareness, one where you no are no longer driven by craving. When you think of craving, think of animal nature.
