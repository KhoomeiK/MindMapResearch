PixelCarRacer,fdickga,t1_fdi1ugm,1578439838.0,"In a sense it kinda is trial and error, what you don’t want too much is mess with any of the gears. Just kinda focus on the final drive, cause if you move up gear 1 by 0.10, you then have to move all other gears up by 0.10, the way the FR9 works is really weird. Usually if you’re going for 1/4 miles, put in like the 3.90-4.00 range, half miles put it around the 3.70-3.85. But if you’re going for top speed go around the 3.30-3.00 range. And if you’re trying to get really specific, then go ahead and tune the gears. Keep in mind that there is like a 0.20 or 0.30 tolerance to the gearing, but don’t try to push it or else the gearing will mess up. Those are my tips, but feel free to go look up some PCR experts on YouTube or on some wikis cause they will go way more into depth than me."
