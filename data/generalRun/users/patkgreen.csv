nfl,ff6g5f9,t1_ff4767h,1579626474.0,"i mean, the people killing others intentionally generally are pretty well trained with a weapon. handling the gun isn't the issue, it's that the people who are intentionally killing several people are fucked in the head."
nfl,ff6dosg,t1_ff5vlf7,1579624945.0,"> It’s an ideological argument at this stage, rather than a cold factual one. I think the debate would be a lot more honest if the pro-gun side we’re happy to admit “we like guns, we don’t like people telling us what to do and I want to reserve the right to kill somebody if I have to”.

that's an important thing. I think it's a major crux similar to the electoral college. in a popular vote, a few cities tell everyone in the country what to do, without any respect or understanding of the culture and feelings of those in different situations. so the electoral kind of means that if the vast majority of all of the interior states agree, the coasts can't change things to their benefit. i know there's more to it and i am not trying to be ugly with this but cultural identity and being told what to do by others who won't be impacted is a very, very difficult thing. it's easy to say ""shooting guns is not a hobby, you trogolodyte - they're gone, too bad"" if that's not part of your life. it's not easy to say if it's something fun for you to do. It's not like we're talking about 1% of people here that have to move for the betterment of society. we're talking about changing 30+% of people and a massive % of landholders' way of life to solve a problem that probably wouldn't be solved by executing a lot of these ideas. plus, in the scheme of data, the deaths and violence prevented is a very very very small percent of the problems. there's a lot of false narratives parroted and thrown around on both sides, but IMO the main question is ""is this action going to solve that problem, and is this solution worth changing the constitution and telling other people what to do?"". it's not an easy, or right, answer.

as far as the other countries you've cited, very few places in the world have the kind of cultural difference that the US has at the coasts and in between."

In fact, octopus genes suggest they fit into the generally understood theory of the evolution of life on Earth, and require no alien invasion. They are thought to have split from the squid lineage around 135 million years ago.
