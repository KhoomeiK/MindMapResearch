borussiadortmund,ffqnyuy,t1_ffqncn5,1580139561.0,"honestly, every source nowadays is basically 50/50."
borussiadortmund,ffqnpkr,t1_ffqke86,1580139381.0,"okay, I am prolly gonna get lynched for this, but:

you have watched maximum 5 games of him *ever.* hot take, but this is what I think reading your reasoning. you look at this [transfermarkt.com](https://transfermarkt.com) statistics and think 'boy, no goal participation over the years - he bad'.

>He was once a promising midfielder.

I literally wrote you down what happened. back injury, transfer to juve, starting position there, sarri came in and nobody gets why he is benched.

>yeah his passing skills are superb

well it doesnt have to be. we have a shit ton of good passers. sometimes the team needs something else entirely, which brings me to the next point (and btw his passing is totally fine - just because he is more a physical player doesnt mean he is not technically skilled)

>he brings something we lack in our current midfield.

he brings verticality. and he brings something, this sub (including me!) has been crying for a long time: body language and fighting mentality. I usually dont like buying players for their sheer physicality, but over the last months we ceraintly missed exactly that. just look at fucking haaland and how he came onto the pitch. he takes everyone with him.

>Not gonna do errors that cost you the game defensively

but this is **has been** exactly our biggest problem for over the last couple seasons! someone HAS a fuck up in almost every game once. and unfortunately it has been akanji over the last games. how can you underrate not making errors?!

anyways, this discussion is pretty pointless, because he is apparently planned for the RCB (+ RB) position. he is so to speak an upgrade over Akanji/Piszu.

don't get me wrong btw, I am not entirely sold on the deal - but I would 100% get behind Zagadou-Hummels-Can in a 3atb. I just don't like the whole 'Can sucks. average player. dont buy.' attitude. after all those years Zorc & Friends haven't made any severe mistakes."
borussiadortmund,ffqhvgr,t1_ffqbngp,1580135040.0,">Gotta be honest with you guys, don’t want to be toxic and I don’t know  how to put this lightly. Maldito\_maduro is trash. Plain average analyst at  best, he doesn’t excel at any specific trait, I really hope that he  shuts my mount cause I’m not one to trash talk other redditors but I really  don’t see this as a wise investment

okay joke aside, what the hell is this comment? this is the epitome of 'I am not a nazi, BUT..'. You call out a player to be trash and give ONE single reason: 'he doesn't excel at anything specific'. I mean, he plays for the national team, he had a starting position at Juve until Sarri came in. He played under Klopp and was only stopped because of a back injury. He clearly MUST excel at something, dont you think? I guess it's the type of player that will always be overlooked: Henderson, Khedira, SMS, Casemiro etc. Unless you are one shiny ass diva like Pogba or a well known game changer like Lampard or Vieria you're under the radar."

30m are *maybe* okayish, but the wage is definitely way too high. Considering his wages around 5m, he would earn double. Why would someone earn double the money he earns at fucking Juventus.

But honestly, also the 30m should be saved for a bigger transfer such as Camavinga or Klostermann or the direct Sancho replacement."

surely if PSG comes around and offers 80m, we're doomed, but the player also has a word in transfers. if we can manage to keep the fee around 40-50m I'd say we should take the risk. this kid is an incredible talent.


also our prestige when it comes to young players is maybe even the best in Europe. where would you rather go? plus the French connection we already have, the connection to rennes, the puma connection, us getting haaland - there's a lot in our favour and MAYBE rennes even allows us to talk to him first."

you don't keep a player who desperately wants to leave. you can keep him on the stands and let him rot there, but NEVER let him play. like honestly, imagine he doesn't train well and then gets subbed in before another player that works his ass of!? that is just ridiculous.

good tackling timing, his interceptions are really smart, good work rate, good positioning, good passing and small dribblings to outplay pressing situations. very agile. vision is also good already. can play a safe pass but also a explode with a small dribbling to move the ball forward. he's very calm for a 17 year old, hence the nickname Calmavinga. overall you wouldn't think a 17 year old is playing there. 

he's probably playstyle wise a mix between GÃ¼ndogan and Busquets"
borussiadortmund,ff8u7ct,t1_ff8rwn3,1579696232.0,"true. but I think we can keep up with the amount of clubs that actually offer him playtime. as long as he isn't stupid enough to think he'll get as much playtime as he would get in Dortmund in Madrid, PSG, Man City, Bayern, Juventus, we have a chance.


surely if PSG comes around and offers 80m, we're doomed, but the player also has a word in transfers. if we can manage to keep the fee around 40-50m I'd say we should take the risk. this kid is an incredible talent.


also our prestige when it comes to young players is maybe even the best in Europe. where would you rather go? plus the French connection we already have, the connection to rennes, the puma connection, us getting haaland - there's a lot in our favour and MAYBE rennes even allows us to talk to him first."

stop blaming favre for EVERYTHING jesus christ. reus has been in a slump from the beginning of this season. he has been wasting attacks and chances no matter what position. 


as I said, GÃ¶tze is underrated as a 9, but who do I keep telling that lol


you don't keep a player who desperately wants to leave. you can keep him on the stands and let him rot there, but NEVER let him play. like honestly, imagine he doesn't train well and then gets subbed in before another player that works his ass of!? that is just ridiculous.

I am by no means defending his actions or whatever it is he's doing or wants. I certainly agree **IF it is all true** that his behaviour is suboptimal and not very professional.
