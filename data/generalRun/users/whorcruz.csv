IncelTears,ff1e8ho,t1_ff0ksa7,1579478074.0,"I think we all just want to fit reasonably well with our partner. Women who are 5' tall might not even be able to kiss you without you guys working to reach each other's lips. 

I'm 5'9 and I've dated guys from 5'7 to 6'4. It just depends. Luckily, there's plenty of people out there at all heights (and not all of them are looking for a 6'7 ""Chad"" ðŸ™„)"

Instagramreality,fe62dy5,t1_fe5dpkh,1578880245.0,Wow. That asshole must have a pretty shitty life to feel the need to show such malice to complete strangers. Anyone who talks like that doesn't deserve to have an opinion in your (or anyone's) self worth. I hope you know you are beautiful.
GuineaPigifs,fe5w763,t3_ennkzd,1578876318.0,"It seems you know the biggest issue is the cage, but I cannot stress this enough, it needs to change ASAP. You have experience with lady piggies, which it great, but a large difference between girls/boys is aggression. Females may fight, but boars are almost expected too without the proper environment. Wishing you luck!"
thesims,fdp29n9,t1_fdo5h2j,1578618284.0,"I'm just sick of Pokemon thinking they can make the same shitty game 100 times and sell 2 versions (OF THE SAME GAME), while maintaining their fan base. It looks like they can, bc sales aren't dropping. I just refuse to support it anymore. They are not up to par with other switch games, and I'm disappointed. 

Sorry, rant over. I just miss enjoying a Pokemon game, and being actually challenged by it."
