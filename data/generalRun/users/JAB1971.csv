Reno,ffvnpya,t3_eva0pf,1580268452.0, Virginia City is fun and inexpensive.
hatemyjob,ffvh45p,t3_evfi0y,1580263977.0,I used to manage 30 people ( they loved me).  I took a job with a medical school and my micromanaging boss just put me in charge of cleaning classrooms.  I have a Masters degree.  I feel your pain.
gastricsleeve,fftgu9w,t3_ev5gap,1580220156.0,"I took Topomax about 10 years ago for migraines.  I dropped 15 lbs. quickly.  I was probably st a 29 BMI at the time.  It worked great at preventing migraines, but I had terrible side effects like a metallic taste in my mouth and episodes of tingling in my fingers and toes.  I stayed on it about 3 years.  Once I went off it, the weight came back quickly.  I’m surprised he’s offering it as I thought it wasn’t being used as much."
Fosterparents,ffpirol,t3_euhrbj,1580096035.0,"That sounds really rough.  I’ve heard that once they get children in your home, you don’t always get the support you need.  My husband also travels and I work full time so I understand your stress.  I wish I had advice for you, but I just wanted you to know someone else understands what you’re going through."
Fosterparents,ffpbkbh,t3_euecsb,1580090962.0,"I wanted a fourth child, my husband negotiated that we would foster/adopt a fourth at some point.  Bio kids are now 20, 17 & 15.  We’ve been in the process of licensing/providing respite for a year.  The first child was a teen and not a good fit so it didn’t work out.  Since November, we’ve been spending time with a 10 year old boy.  I was so nervous about whether we were doing the right thing.  Having spent a lot of time with him, we’ve been fortunate to get to know him first.  I’m not going to say it will be easy, but I really like him, I know his bad behaviors and how to address them, and I see so much potential which has gotten me over the hump.  He moves in on 2/14 permanently."

GetMotivated,ffmcqpf,t3_eu5nbb,1580052486.0,There’s a fine line between excellence and obsessive compulsive disorder which can create hell for some people and those around you.
hatemyjob,ffmbldg,t3_eu4nif,1580051924.0,Are there any government programs that could help you?  I know in our state they prioritize hiring people with disabilities (that don’t prevent work from being done) or maybe help you learn new skill like office tasks.  Have you tried a temp agency?

nevadapolitics,ffgf3tk,t3_etbi1f,1579904822.0,"I’m not gonna say Nevada doesn’t need work in this area, but some of the criteria is questionable such as parents’ levels of education.  I’m sure it can be helpful in some cases to have a parent who has a higher education, but does it really affect our ability now to prepare a child?  That would have occurred in the past and is not really something that can currently be worked on in most cases."
serialkillers,ffg9c22,t3_etfu0m,1579901256.0,"I tend not to keep things like birthday cards to keep clutter down, but maybe I should hang onto them in case I know a serial killer, but don’t know it yet."
hatemyjob,ffg83y2,t3_etb2za,1579900504.0,Take care of yourself.  I have felt the way you do.  It gets better.
gastricsleeve,ffg7pl2,t3_etdlxy,1579900255.0,You look 20 years younger.  Congrats!
hatemyjob,fff0h8e,t3_etabn2,1579872249.0,Enjoy your day off!
GreenBayPackers,ff79zms,t3_eru2rx,1579644235.0,"I really enjoyed this season.  It was very different than the last several.  We were far from perfect, but those come-from-begins wins are exciting.  We didn’t deserve to go to the Super Bowl this year, but now we can be excited for next year’s potential.  I love my Packers."
Fosterparents,ff56vhh,t1_ff56apx,1579581940.0,Thank you!  I’ll check it out.
Fosterparents,ff45y81,t1_ff3zixk,1579556267.0,Thanks.  I will look into it.
halloween,ff2e7ip,t3_er5jhm,1579502491.0,I was there in January several years ago.  It was mesmerizing.  Icy and magical.  Would love to go back.
Fosterparents,ff1tor1,t1_ff1syri,1579485947.0,That’s amazing that he lost that much.  I think picking out healthy snacks is a great idea.  Reading the food labels is very educational for kids.
Fosterparents,ff1rv4m,t1_ff1r8w1,1579484794.0,"Yes, that’s great advice.  I’ve taken him to the grocery store after CrossFit to pick out a piece of fruit as his reward.  He said usually he gets Hershey bars, but seemed happy with the fruit."
Fosterparents,ff1mpp7,t1_ff1m8kg,1579481730.0,"It sounds you’re taking a similar approach that we’d like to take.  It’s good for everyone to only have healthy food around.  

Did you ever have a conversation with him regarding his weight?"
Fosterparents,ff1mgwn,t1_ff1lw88,1579481619.0,That’s good advice.  We have a team meeting this week and will request professional help in how to deal with it.  I really want to know if it’s something we should discuss with him or not.  I know it’s a sensitive subject.
GreenBayPackers,fewl1om,t1_fewkwr2,1579413188.0,He looks like a muppet.....but I still like him.
NatureIsFuckingLit,fepa8np,t3_eq2nsr,1579315636.0,This kinda grossed me out.
glasscutting,fepa6lq,t3_eq2hn2,1579315599.0,I would like to know as well.  Beautiful.
hatemyjob,fepa4cm,t3_eq3p7s,1579315558.0,"Stick with what you love.  You are probably being too hard on yourself.  You will only get better.  Some people find pleasure in making others feel incompetent because of their own insecurities.  If you are not hearing from those that matter that there’s a problem, then there isn’t one.  Keep working hard and ignore the others."
GreenBayPackers,feoocm1,t3_eq4799,1579302985.0,Bet those are some proud cheeseheads.

gastricsleeve,fekc9jw,t1_fek9p4i,1579197037.0,That is awesome!  How much have you lost in 4 months?
BadBoss,fejkpuy,t1_fejk3ze,1579178159.0,"Yes, we have HR, but they are ineffective.  I witnessed a fight between my boss and another employee and had to give HR my version of things.  They twisted what I told them (I was unbiased and told the truth).  Nothing effective came out of it.  It’s a very protected place.  I may need to go to them anyways ."
