Cringetopia,feistxf,t1_fei1gh9,1579146307.0,I ordered fried green tea ice cream once and it came with chocolate AND strawberry sauce on top. Was not in the description. You bet I sent that back.
Frugal,feiody1,t1_feimquf,1579143250.0,Ah ok that makes sense to do the math like that. Thanks! I will definitely try a simple cash flow comparison.
Frugal,feio4rt,t1_fein932,1579143080.0,Cool thanks. That sounds like a decent guideline!
Frugal,feil5o8,t1_feiivr3,1579141086.0,Very true! Any advice on at what point you’d stop getting it fixed? I’m leaning towards repair at this point but if it keeps resulting in #2 at what point does the money not make sense?
Frugal,feikz24,t1_feiiwiw,1579140961.0,"That’s very good to think about, thanks. So far it’s been extremely reliable so I’m not worried about that yet. More trying to think about just the financial costs and benefits of repair vs replace."
CabinPorn,fei5l4f,t1_fei35yf,1579130782.0,For resident artists. I think they do 2-week programs where artists can come and stay for free and be inspired by nature.
BeAmazed,fe6d1yx,t1_fe63jfc,1578887370.0,"That one looked like a subadult male to me, it’s got some scruff coming in. But beautiful coat. Heard white ones are pretty rare but are more common in parts of Africa with white sands."
Awwducational,fdyzft5,t1_fdy3wwk,1578785148.0,Interesting! My experience is in Kenya where I took the photo and where I’m mostly around animal behaviorists. A lot of them use Estes field guide to behavior of African mammals. I think Estes calls all the juveniles of all Bovidae species “calves” so the community I’m in is probably biased towards the scientific community’s lingo.
Awwducational,fdxy9sc,t1_fdtyiye,1578774157.0,I’ve always herd bucks for males and calves for the offspring in most antelope. Can you share a source for lambs?
Awwducational,fdvrpcy,t1_fdu6f0m,1578750774.0,"Where did you hear about tame impalas? I’d love to meet them! These guys were wild in the Maasai Mara, Kenya."
Awwducational,fdtn3tx,t1_fdtmzio,1578719165.0,Only the adults are fast food.
Awwducational,fdtfmx5,t1_fdt84xh,1578716071.0,"Hm yeah, I didn’t think about that- when I looked up the source for the title they called them calves so I just went with it!"
Awwducational,fdt2woo,t1_fdsv5zb,1578711216.0,"I wish! In Maasai Mara, Kenya. :)"

birdpics,fdrqumd,t1_fdrphxy,1578688239.0,Thanks!
dogs,fdaf54a,t1_fda9w5n,1578245381.0,"Oh, that's a really good idea! I didn't even think of that. Thanks."
dogs,fdaf2uk,t1_fdabgmf,1578245355.0,"Thanks, that's really interesting that their personalities grew up so different! And I think I may be attributing what's just my dog's more independent personality to her size then! She'll join us on the bed for belly rubs for a bit but usually prefers to sleep somewhere she can stretch out."
dogs,fdael0o,t1_fdaa293,1578245207.0,"Now that she's five she definitely cuddles more, but she's big for a Belgian and enventually wants more space to stretch out whether it's the sofa or the bed (and she overheats even though we keep our apt pretty cool). Her preferred sleeping spot is by the patio door. But, maybe I'm attributing to her size what's really more just an independent personality trait! She's very affectionate, i.e. seeks belly rubs, but isn't really a snuggle per se."
AdviceAnimals,fcncb8z,t1_fcmvd3l,1577808622.0,In the US most of the time you can pay at the pump.
AdviceAnimals,fclved0,t1_fclus6m,1577757403.0,Not if you’re out shortly after the pump stops. We can see when the pump is still attached to the car. :)
AdviceAnimals,fclse77,t3_ehvhvl,1577755311.0,"Unless you’re paying inside, we understand in that case. BUT, I know you’re not ALL paying inside!"
rarepuppers,fciz0nf,t3_ehfpxu,1577673233.0,"Just like my dog, the wrapping paper is almost as good (or better?) than the toy itself."
travel,fciwydy,t3_ehfd49,1577671802.0,"Also, Tsavo East and West are absolutely stunning parks that are on the way to Mombasa. Incredible views of wildlife with Mt Kilimanjaro in the background."
travel,fciwvj5,t3_ehfd49,1577671748.0,I’ve only been to Lamu out of those places but the cultural heritage in Lamu is amazing. Been twice and brought my family there. The dhow sailboats are wonderful and the snorkeling is fantastic (some times of the year).
AskReddit,fcinf0g,t3_ehduyn,1577665498.0,"So that you can show them how big it is, of course."
StarWars,fcaucbo,t3_egl8ci,1577576776.0,"Let’s be real. Those three movies were a giant cock tease and all we got was one measily little kiss. 

We can all say we wanted more of Adam Driver acting Ben but really we just needed Ben and Rey to bang."
aww,fc24f0u,t3_efroqc,1577339980.0,First time watching Guardians of the Galaxy 2 guys and I can’t handle how cute baby groot is.
Eyebleach,faj39no,t3_e9bm0m,1576123253.0,"Looks more like a mule to me. But, it’s a tough angle."
