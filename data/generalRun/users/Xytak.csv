They believe society is shaped like a pyramid and those at the top are fundamentally more deserving than those at the bottom.

Thus, if a slave complains that life isn't fair, well... it's not supposed to be.  You're a slave, you're not entitled to fair treatment.

However, if a King complains that life isn't fair, now we have a real problem.  Whatever his issue is, it needs to be addressed right away, because society exists to please the King and it is through the King that all other power is derived.

* The Romulan homeworld is destroyed as part of the backstory for Star Trek 2009.  Even though this is a JJ-verse movie and I have my own opinion about how seriously to take it, the franchise owners consider it ""prime universe canon.""  For better or worse, we're stuck with it.

* The Cardassians are less ""attractive"" and relatable for audiences.  They are more expensive in terms of makeup, and share an unfortunate name with certain mid-2000's celebrities.  This is a problem if the producers are trying to make the show accessible for general audiences.

* DS9 explored the Cardassians pretty thoroughly in a 7-year story arc.  I happen to think DS9 is the best Star Trek show of them all, but it struggled to find an audience when it aired.  It's a lot of canon for the writers to keep track of and expand upon.  The Romulans, by contrast, do not already have a whole series about them, so it's more of a blank slate to work with."

Now consider They Are Billions.  In some missions, you don't get feedback for hours, and then something wipes you out.  (Some maps don't even have enemies until the final wave!)

At that point, maybe you might restore from a previous save and try a different type of defense, learning the strengths and weaknesses of units?  Nope.

You speak like this is obvious, but it seems far from intuitive to me.  If two cars are honking at eachother a block away, does it make much difference if they're next to eachother or 100 ft apart?  Does sound actually work that way?  If so, I've never noticed it.

Nevertheless, it's a game mechanic so we have to accept it.  In fact, it's probably THE most important game mechanic.

If you get spotted, the other DD will certainly outgun you.  You can bet the entire enemy team will drop what they're doing and focus you, and then light you up Russian 12km radar to boot.  Still, you can usually break contact with skillful WASD and a bit of luck.  It just requires going through 55 seconds of hell.

The sequence usually goes like this:   I venture a bit too close to the cap and get spotted by the other DD.  I dodge his torpedoes and come under concentrated fire from the entire enemy team, but I manage to get away, perhaps missing a chunk of health.  Then comes the long range Soviet Radar and another round of concentrated fire for what seems like an eternity, but like a fox escaping the hounds I manage to make it through.  

At that point, I pretty much feel like I've done what I needed to do.  The enemy has won the cap and I'm off to lick my wounds.  If I get spotted again by a surface ship who cut off my escape, then OK I got outplayed.  I accept that.
