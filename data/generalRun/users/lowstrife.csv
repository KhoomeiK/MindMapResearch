Technically there is, it involves stitching multiple exposures together to form one image. Night sight on Google Pixel, and basically every HDR mode on every camera ever. It doesn't increase the resolution persay, but it will decrease image noise\grain and improve contrast - especially in low light situations.

But functionally, you're correct. You can't actually increase the resolution of a digital camera. And even film is limited to the granular size of the tiny pellets on the exposed film. More resolution = more bigger optics. You can't cheat physics. 

I would imagine a lot of work is being done on other spectrums of light (infrared) along with AI-learning for image processing of multiple exposures like I said above. And perhaps even infraterometry as well, where you take multiple pictures from different locations and then ""stitch"" them together to give some 3D data to the 2D picture.

How was your tire stance? Matt Farah, and many of the Mustang guys he's had on, always say those cars are better if you're on a square stance instead of a staggered one.

A Hellcat... is a modern muscle car man. It's a 700 horsepower couch on wheels, and I'd kill to have one. I think they're extremely good at what they're designed to do - demolish continents. And rear tires. But trust me, that is not a controllable or ""agile"" car. 

I'm going to refrence the c63 here because while it doesn't have as much power as the Hellkitty, it is ""broadly"" the same thing (RWD muscle car with too much power for the rear wheels). And I have a shitload of seat time in the car and really got to know how it drives extremely well. When you turn the traction control semi-off, it allows the rear wheels to spin up. But it doesn't upset the chassis. It still drives perfectly straight. If you floor it on the exit of a corner at the right time, it will perfectly spin the tires up to about 10-20mph more than your actual speed and you'll just power straight out of it. No drama. No upset. No chassis weirdness. No sketchy feeling at all. It just steps out... in a beautiful way. Maybe 5-10 degrees of slip, but nothing major. I had to INTENTIONALLY chuck the car into the slide, left foot brake and floor it to upset the car to get the ECS system to engage and save me. I needed to find where the limits of the car were. You do this in a controlled situation so that it doesn't surprise you on the open road. So I got into an empty industrial area in the middle of the night with roads designed for semi trucks and did this. I've never driven such a powerful car with so much control. I've been in a 2003 Terminator (a shitbox handling wise, I know), and that thing felt like it wanted to walk sideways whenever it broke traction. That is not the case with modern performance RWD cars. And a Hellcat, while better than the Terminator, behaves very similarly to the Mustangs when the rear wheels start spinning.

But I think this is where our perspectives diverge: I don't think driving with TC off is inherently dangerous. There is a big difference from getting an extra +10mph wheelspin on the corner exit vs intentionally upsetting the car and doing a drifto-burnout on the public road.

IMO stability control (I.E the car using the brakes to control yaw) is the real electronic saver, not traction control. 

And I've driven about 6 cars I'd consider to be in the ""class"" where this applies, all of them on roads exactly like this. I know as well :)"
cars,fdnmbya,t1_fdnfket,1578588784.0,"Traction control and stability control are two different systems. 

You can turn traction off and it will just be detrimental to the treadwear of your rear tires. It allows wheelspin, but the electronics will still step in if you get too much yaw in exactly the same way as with all the systems on. This is how most modern systems in performance cars work. They'll let you have a little bit of slip, but the systems are still ""there"" to prevent you from getting out of line.

According to some forums on google, the only way to actually disable the nannies is to start pulling fuses under the hood. And considering this guy's dashboard isn't lit up like a christmas tree, the systems are still on. At the beginning of the video, you can see these systems are on as he still gets a traction light when doing the first pull."

This doesn't actually matter. You just have to understand that if you have a base crypto as collateral, your effective leverage is already 1x. Where if you have cash, your effective leverage is 0x.

BitcoinMarkets,fdm21et,t3_em279s,1578537937.0,"So, listen, I'm going to be honest with you.

If it's a struggle to understand how this very VERY basic level of margin plays, this game isn't for you my friend. This isn't options, which do have a steep learning curve before you ""get it"". Basic spot margin doesn't even have the extra details and complexities that true futures entail. There really are only like two mechanisms at play. And realistically, at the end of the day, you buy, you sell. If the price moves too far against you, you get liquidated. That's it.

If this is a hurdle to understand beyond the support documentation and random youtube videos; then I say again, this game isn't for you.

This allowed me to get my utilization down and further increase my score. Having higher credit limits also helps, further increasing your score... It's designed to be self reenforcing. 

Raising credit is weird and varies per company. At one point, I had 50k line of credit across all my cards with <5% utilization... But one card only had a 2k limit. I had a 750 credit score and they refused to raise the limit for 2 years until randomly they emailed me it had been raised to $7000. I never understood the rhyme or reason.

I don't know of one ""brand"" who's better than the others. It varies on a model-to-model basis. 

Except on one thing. Power supplies. Do not fucking cheap out here. I would not spend less than $60, regardless of how low power it is. Buy from big OEM brands (Corsair, EVGA, Seasonic, Antec are the top 4 at the moment IMO). Do not buy Great Wall or cheap knockoff stuff. I'd stay away from Rosewell too.

That being said; if you're using a tool to accomplish a job (computer, power tool, whatever), paying more for more performance does payoff. You spend less time waiting, less things breaking, etc, etc. The math on how much things ""cost"" completely changes when it's a tool you use to make a living vs. a toy.

I've spent about $8000 on my computer, but that's because I use it to make a living. About $2500 of it was extraneous stuff (extra harddrive redundancy, fast SSD's, good audio equipment); but the majority of it is necessary for me to accomplish my job.

Whether I gave it 25% throttle or 100% throttle, the car still jumped off the line in first gear the same way once boost kicked in.
