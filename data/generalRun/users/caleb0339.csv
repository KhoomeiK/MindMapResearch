pens,fcz6mxm,t1_fcum5d1,1578094736.0,I own the 001 and 002 but am desperate for the 003 and 004. Where can I buy them stateside? I won’t be going to Japan for another year.

aww,fcxwods,t1_fcxvxn1,1578071565.0,"I feel a bit bad now. Every time it had happened before it was when my gf was home alone.  She said it made her anxious that a man knocked on the door and then held it shut, so when it happened while I was at home I ripped the door open and told him to not do it anymore. No packages since so I’m not sure what will happen next time. I may owe him an apology."
aww,fcxsejp,t1_fcxc2du,1578069759.0,"I wish my postman felt the same. If a package has to be signed for he will knock, then hold the door closed until he has verbal confirmation the dogs are secured. Only then will he release the door to be opened. I feel it crosses a line and it scares my girlfriend."
