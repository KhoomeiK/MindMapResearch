Games,ff4bfu2,t1_ff4anh7,1579559696.0,"I did wish it too. Game companies are penny wise pound foolish. Or maybe it's the market that makes them that way. Because as the saying goes ""you can't make a baby in one month with 9 women"" applies to software development, you're dis incentivized from hiring more people. They just squeeze what they can out of what they got. And why wouldn't they? Devs get no OT pay. And because it's a passion field a lot of people won't leave.

At the same time this 24/7 crunch makes the really smart and capable *but unwilling to endure the awful conditions* programmers out of the industry. My background is EE and I'm only a recent graduate but I know people close to me who do take software jobs and none of them want to go into video games.

I'm hoping that the devs can organize meaningfully to stop this awful industry."

The other possible interpretation is that it's Department of Homeland Security. ICE is a part of Homeland Security. ICE oversaw and implemented the Family Separation Policy, which tore migrant kids from their parents and put the kids into private prisons with inadequate provisions.

Either the person is a POS parent or they're politically active about family separation policy."

TwoXChromosomes,feo3ctl,t1_fenoz1a,1579294596.0,"Ultimately Congress gets the ultimate trump card by way of Constitutional amendment, but that's a very drawn out process and requires 4/5 of states to ratify."
TwoXChromosomes,feng2jd,t1_fendu3n,1579283918.0,"It's not an explicit right. You won't find it in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, or any further constitutional amendments. The Right to Privacy was made common law by the interpretation of the Ninth amendment.

> The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

This has been interpreted to mean that the people still retain rights not explicitly mentioned by the Constitution and its amendments. The Supreme Court decided that while the Constitution did not explicitly contain a right to privacy, the Fourth, Fifth, and 14th amendments speak to the spirit of such a right to privacy in *Griswold v. Connecticut (1965)*. Which ultimately was about a married couple's access to contraception. In *Roe v. Wade (1973)* that ""right to privacy"" was extended to pregnant women in their right to an abortion. Then in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992)* while still upholding the right to an abortion, the Supreme Court lowered the strictness of review for laws restricting access to abortion.

Because the Supreme Court made these protections the only ones who can overrule these protections are the Supreme Court, and they can. While typically the Supreme Court will refer to its own precedent, it can and will overrule itself. Which is why Trump stacking the Court is so troublesome. If Roe v. Wade is overturned it'll be down to individual states to protect women. And I assume Kansas is trying to get ready for a Roe v. Wade free Constitution. In addition the Kansas Supreme Court decision may include more proctetions than *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* ."
