The best medical way to deal with it is transitioning. Which they 
are. [Long story short, it's a complex matter but brain studies suggest that mtf and ftm have parts of the brain that match the gender they percieve themselves as, not as the one they were assumed to be].

For most people what happens is:

- The gender you are and the way your brain is wired matches up to what your body develops into.

For trans people, a very small part of the population.

- The gender you are and the way your brain is wired does not match up into what your body developed into.

Thus they change the body to fit.

The issues are that a large number of people [TERFS and others] claim that they aren't the gender they transition into and that it's just a 'male plot to rape women in the bathrooms'.

You don't just find the items, take them out then that is that.

Where the items are, how they are layed out, the condition they are in, how they are stored, how they are placed together are all *vital information* which is destroyed when collections are broken up to be sold off piece meal.
