If you've ever held a cat and it gets really scared like a dog barking or fire alarm going off, you may have noticed a rather disgusting smell. This is a discharge from the feline anal gland.

However, active marking is usually done through urine. Passive marking is the equivalent of saying ""I'm here"" versus active marking, or ""This is mine"".

I was able to quit with the help of Chantix. It's a pill that blocks your brain's ability to absorb nicotine. And man, it works!

Well, you need to ween yourself off it Chantix and not just stop it cold turkey. Dummy me quit smoking and decided to quit Chantix too since I no longer needed it.

Well, I went insane.

Literally.

I had a 3 day long panic attack. I had never had panic attacks before. I had absolutely no idea what was happening. There was a sphere of nothingness in my bedroom. If I got too close or looked at it too long, it would start to absorb me. I slept in the living room. I had to keep my bedroom door shut in case I accidentally looked inside.

I had the world's worst existential crisis. I was convinced that the worst possible thing people could do was procreate. I felt like life itself was a massive mistake and should cease to exist for the rest of time. I didn't want to die, I wanted life to never have happened in the first place.

This went on for 3 days until there was a piece of me that finally screamed out, ""THIS IS NOT FUCKING NORMAL!!!"" I went that day to see a doctor and got a prescription for Clonopin. 40 minutes after taking one, my brain cleared out and I remember screaming ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!?!?!?""

It's been over two years, and I'm still trying to recover mentally. I will guarantee one thing though. I will NEVER have a cigarette ever again. No fucking way am I ever going through that again.

xbox,fcmu411,t3_ehwobm,1577792350.0,"The issue is re-orgs, or reorganizations. Many groups in Microsoft are reorganized often. Xbox is reorganized constantly.

Someone once had an idea for a second screen experience for the 360 and created a prototype. It eventually got funded, and it turned into a way to create web blended experiences on phones and tablets. Controller and keyboard input was added. This turned into SmartGlass and a small team owned it.

Re-org.

Durango was coming, otherwise known as Xbox One. Don Mattrick said stupid shit and Major Nelson ripped the microphone out of someone's hand talking about mythical switches. Everything got defunded and it was all hands on deck for Durango.

Re-org.

Everything got dumped, and Steven Sinofsky convinced Balmer that Xbox must be written on top of Windows 8. Those of us in Xbox bitched very loudly. Deaf ears.

Re-org.

Mattrick, Sinofsky, and Balmer either retire, resign, or get shoved out the door. Marc Whitten steps in gets Xbox One out the door. Oops. We totally forgot about Xbox.com, Avatars, and SmartGlass. Xbox.com folks got shoved into things like game and system help, sign up, and account stuff on the console. The avatar team in Eastern Europe were all laid off.

Re-org.

Smartglass eventually gets re-funded and turns into the Xbox app. We've got dedicated teams for core functionality, iOS, Android, Windows, and Windows Phone. Features are added regularly. It is tested on hundreds of devices. Bugs are squashed quickly. It's a well oiled machine.

Re-org.

All Xbox app teams are squashed, and people are moved elsewhere. The Xbox app is mostly abandoned. Skeleton crew addresses security bugs only. No new features, no releases, no bug fixes.

Re-org.

Bullshit with Playfab. Most Xbox Live heads abandon ship. New dev lead in Xbox Live (let's call him Z) is hated by Satan himself. Mass exodus ensues. My team went from 17 people down to 4 before I finally got fed up and quit after 9 years. Management is in complete shambles and everyone hates everything.

(This next part is now 2nd hand info as I am no longer there).

XCloud, which has been re-orged like 4 times already (was originally Rio) is finally gaining traction and support from upper management. Unfortunately, it becomes super fucking political. Head of XCloud gets so fed up, he quits the company after 20+ years.

No one knows what to do with Playfab. Half their people are dumped into XCloud. Wrong experience set!

Someone realizes that the Xbox app needs people working on it! It gets somewhat funded, and there are slow updates coming out.

Now, I may sound like a disgruntled former employee. I am not. Microsoft was by far the best job I have ever had in my entire life, and I am truly honored to have been given the opportunity to work there, and contribute to so many great products and services over the years. It was the greatest highlight of my life.

Frequent reorganizations hurt more than they helped. When the right management was in place, we were unstoppable. Phil Spencer is a fantastic head for the brand overall, and I am honored to have worked for him. It's a very large organization, and some places need much better management and stability to thrive.
