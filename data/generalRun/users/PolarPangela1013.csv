Simply believing that because these things are attainable because they can be purchased does not mean the average American has the ability to purchase them.

JoeRogan,ffg1p2w,t1_fffzo5t,1579896545.0,"You're right those were the highs during the Great Depression. Even still there are roughly 329 million Americans, 39.7 million report below the poverty line, 18.5 million report living in deep poverty (together that's roughly 20%), as well as an uncountable number of homeless citizens and veterans nationwide (which the plight of homeless veterans makes the point here that the US is no great, successful country) as well as undocumented immigrants who aren't able to go through the immigration process.

Oh and these US Census statistics are from 3 years ago"
JoeRogan,fffzqyn,t1_fffzjev,1579895348.0,"Uhhh because that's not medical innovation... It's simply a ploy for profit margins, not some altruistic heroic act to save the people by wide net distribution.

If it were people in the US wouldn't be rationing insulin to pay bills (which if you research there's been a spike in recent years of diabetic deaths due to this that directly correlates with spikes on insulin prices)"

But the US IS number one in some categories; number of citizens incarcerated per capitalist, number of adults who believe angels are real, and defense spending (where we spend more than the next 26 countries COMBINED, 25of which are allies)"
JoeRogan,fffz0rj,t1_fffxrq2,1579894899.0,"No one is attacking innovation, just the corporate greed that has diluted our vision for their profits so you think these things are unobtainable. Also these patents are largely held by the American medical system because the patents of their creators ran out and corporations tweaked the recipe and obtained said patents in order to monopolize their stranglehold on modern medicine to keep profits flowing. None of these are marks of medical innovations only capitalist innovations."
