It just sounds like you’re conflating two different things. *womens hands can hold tattoos better. So that means that specifically it works better on women’s hands.* that’s not how it works. Neutrally it works the exact same on both hands. It just depends on who has the better skin that day. It has nothing to do with it specifically being the palm."
todayilearned,ffq79hx,t1_ffpzrhx,1580124233.0,"Actually they can definitely hold. Maybe not for you whole life, but long enough that you’ll always know what it is. But you have to go to an artist who specialises in them otherwise you’re wasting your money as it’ll be gone within a few weeks."
todayilearned,ffq77r5,t1_ffq30zm,1580124162.0,"It has nothing to do with men’s/women’s hands. It depends on the artist. Some can get it to stay, some can’t. That’s all."
badwomensanatomy,ffogfa4,t1_ffo6wkl,1580077347.0,I think some people on this sub don’t realise how toxic they act. Just because someone isn’t knowledgable on different things lol.
SequelMemes,ffnvoq2,t1_ffnt7ya,1580071443.0,"It was one complete sentence. Not two different sentences. It’s not two hamfisted lines. 

Now you’ll die like him, okay boomer?"
HongKong,ffgqhx5,t1_ffgpvo9,1579912481.0,It’s wild some people latch on to old definitions (not necessarily in this case but I always think some people do that just to try and flex about how smart they are because they read that fact somewhere. Forgetting that no one has used it like that in 50 years.) do they not get that words change definitions?
ExpectationVsReality,ffgqasr,t1_ffgplkd,1579912336.0,"I’ve always been annoyed when people don’t get kicked out. I understand not wanting to pay someone to do that. And it’s hard to get the employees to care enough (can relate). But I wish there was like an app or something to get an ushers attention and have them do something. 

Mainly because I’m too much of a bitch to say something myself of course..."
ExpectationVsReality,ffgo1b9,t1_ffgbiv0,1579910737.0,I don’t live in America but I often hear about how Alamo do it right. One of my biggest concerns about it was the food. With people being near you chomping away and smelling up the place (that part I’m not overly concerned about because it doesn’t stink like shot in a restaurant so I don’t see why the smell would be gross in this case) like the other commenter mentioned. How does Alamo do it right?
modernwarfare,ffgnthd,t1_ffgnoxq,1579910583.0,As in the one in the pic lol
modernwarfare,ffgnndv,t1_ffg136b,1579910466.0,"Credibility lol, like the dudes running for office."
modernwarfare,ffgnlt4,t1_fffqyw1,1579910434.0,Or NATO phonetic alphabet if you’re feeling real fancy.
modernwarfare,ffgnghi,t1_fffykzz,1579910331.0,Yeh. But what’s the stupidity that could be involved here? Kinda feel like this is giving them too much wiggle room. They’re intentionally not fixing something that in no way is an inherent negative.
modernwarfare,ffgnaok,t3_etc8ul,1579910221.0,Perks counting is fine. The one thing I hate about gunsmith is that you simply can’t quantify how much an attachment to will help for a certain thing. It’s just displayed on some arbitrary bar. Just give me actual numbers ffs.
modernwarfare,ffgn70q,t1_ffgeza0,1579910152.0,"Yeh this is still giving them too much slack tbh. Stuff like that is just embarrassing lol. Same with the scars vertical recoil being changed, instead of the horizontal recoil like it said in the patch notes."
dogpictures,ffffug8,t3_etaju9,1579883047.0,My goodness. He had a head like a t-rex! Rest in peace to the little bruiser!
awfuleverything,ffet1sp,t1_ffeljud,1579864178.0,Most artists use those reds by default these days. Because the red inks of the past we’re pretty terribly made and would often fall out or cause reactions for most people.
pussypassdenied,ffesuxo,t1_ffemzep,1579863914.0,Because it’s typically young white mean who spew this kind of rhetoric. Not really hard to figure out...
quityourbullshit,fferm1k,t1_ffer8al,1579862111.0,Right... this ain’t very layered but you’re making it out to be. The person was just making a joke. Chill.
PrequelMemes,fferg4n,t3_et3lwp,1579861865.0,I’m glad they destroyed the Expanded Universe. That shit was way too studios to be kept alive.
modernwarfare,ffdpqxj,t1_ffdd1kx,1579826031.0,They also have a patch notes tab IN THE GAME Where they don’t even list all the changes...
science,ffdguqu,t1_ffdgap4,1579820584.0,"That does logically work lol. What are you talking about?  

I have to have killed someone to have a say on this? So you’re telling me you’ve killed someone then?

I’m not sure how you can’t connect the two dots. It’s the same way that if a suicidal person isn’t around ways they can easily kill themselves, they’re less likely to do it."
science,ffdfoh3,t1_ffctgov,1579819896.0,Yeh that’s cool but for a lot of people a car is a necessity. While a gun isn’t is it.
science,ffdfmfw,t1_ffdf3z9,1579819862.0,"Prevention... not having such easy access to certain things can dissuade people from ever commuting that act. 

Killing with a gun is a whole lot easier and more effective than using a knife. It’s not a hard connection."
science,ffden2j,t1_ffdaret,1579819269.0,"It’s called prevention. 

You will never know truly how many you prevent but you can be sure you stopped someone from doing because of ease of access."
modernwarfare,ffdclke,t1_ffdc3bo,1579818029.0,It.. is all black. What you’re seeing a reflection on the non matte part of the guns.
modernwarfare,ffd82m2,t1_ffd1mq5,1579815240.0,I sent u my deeg. Pls respond
modernwarfare,ffd6a0m,t1_ffd1mq5,1579814245.0,...k? https://imgur.com/a/gmt1rpy you are aware of what monochromatic means right? Would be a bit weird if they fucked up the name.
modernwarfare,ffctswn,t1_ffctd40,1579807115.0,.... no it doesn’t?
xboxone,ffchze2,t1_ffaye4r,1579799866.0,If you just bought a game on game pass or very shortly coming to game pass. You can contact support and they’ll refund you if you want it.
Eminem,ffcgcrn,t1_ffbqlfy,1579798866.0,Definition of the word “that”. It’s just a joke lol.
Eminem,ffcg7qz,t3_esspje,1579798780.0,She’s a good rapper. But she gave a fuckin terrible representation of that on this album. Shame really :/ it’s your one chance to probably do what ever you want and flex as hard as you can. And then you come back with this? Eughh
Eminem,ffcfx59,t1_ffcd9lb,1579798602.0,It’s nothing special. There’s just some spliced footage of people running away after the shooting starts. They’re just on screen for a few frames.
modernwarfare,ffcda8s,t1_ffcd09n,1579796974.0,"It’s not complaining about just one, they all work like this. That’s kinda the point of the post. They all do this. 

Monochromatic deagle? Change the trigger to one that’s actually useful and now half the gun is silver...

I understand it would take a lot of work, my point is that the implementation of it is pretty terrible. I’m glad they exist, they’re obviously not an inherent negative. It’s just done in a weird way."
modernwarfare,ffccrai,t1_ffbz1ue,1579796646.0,How is even relevant at all lol? I get you’re enjoying your circle jerk that people should never complain. But the whole execution of blueprints is terrible. Change one attachment and then for the most part you lose the skin that makes the blueprint alluring.
modernwarfare,ffcclsf,t3_esrf70,1579796551.0,"I don’t mean to sound SO dramatic here. But, blueprints are some of the worst implementations I have ever seen in the game lol. They make no fuckin sense. 

*ooo, purist m4! Finally, all black. There’s no point in the extended mag so I’ll just change that for a useful attachment. Oh, it’s back to the normal tan colour -_-*

Most of them come with terrible attachments that you can’t change otherwise it ruins the entire draw for these blueprints. 

Take the monochromatic deagle. Amazing! Matte black deagle! Change the trigger it comes with and now half the gun is silver again... same deal with the deagle you got from winning the tournament. Great looking skin but I don’t like any of those attachments so it’s a waste really."
nonononoyes,ffcamzb,t1_ffc2uva,1579795313.0,"I mean, dogs ain’t no pussies. They’re not wasting their time pumping over speed humps."
nonononoyes,ffc1132,t1_ffc02t1,1579788799.0,"That’s a bit of a stretch on the whole circle jerk that dogs don’t emote in ways we think. 

There are plenty of dogs that love doing stuff like this. It’s not really a controversial take. It’s obviously mostly because they like just being involved with their human."
gifsthatkeepongiving,ffc0tzg,t3_esr4u0,1579788649.0,Somewhat unrelated and a total overreaction. But fuck bread being rolled in a napkin. I don’t want to eat some bread then while my hands on a crumb filled napkin.
modernwarfare,ffbtp5g,t1_ffaevz9,1579782379.0,"It’s obvious why it was downvoted, let’s not act so coy. 

I don’t really care, but whether you meant it or not. Saying “you sure?” In response to a claim comes off confrontational. That’s all."
modernwarfare,ffbmniw,t1_ffbml85,1579772949.0,"Ikr, for shame."
agedlikemilk,ffbmd80,t1_ffaz9c1,1579772507.0,"Yeh that’s the most surprising part right? If you’re going to be on a song with em. You obviously know you’re probably going to be outshined, but why not still give it literally everything you’ve got? It’s the best platform to show off and not make another radio hook."
modernwarfare,ffbmab1,t1_ffbi726,1579772381.0,Woah super sleuth
CasualUK,ffbm9zc,t1_ffbkh9d,1579772367.0,"That’s the thing lol, everywhere I try and do this it’s nowhere near a rough area. Dominos just hates my cash :("
