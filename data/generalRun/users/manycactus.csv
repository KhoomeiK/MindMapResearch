You then responded with your idiotic [""but language evolves""]( https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/et2ew3/a_block_of_wood_thats_been_electrocuted/ffeg3bj) comment.

That, of course, doesn't make the change good. It doesn't make the change non-frustrating. And it sure as fuck doesn't address the underlying ambiguity concern.

What that comment did do was undermine appeals to etymology (which neither he nor I was making).

But now you're trying to make etymology relevant!

God damn, you're stupid."
mildlyinteresting,fffxpw4,t1_fffx2yx,1579894090.0,There's nothing to add. You still can't link your general descriptive claim about change to his specific claim about quality. Etymology has nothing to do with it.
mildlyinteresting,fffwu8l,t1_fffwbwp,1579893545.0,You're doing great work here. Keep it up.
mildlyinteresting,fffwmys,t1_fffwhda,1579893417.0,"And you think that's about etymology?

Your going to need to explain that to me."
mildlyinteresting,fffvu8e,t1_fffv9bq,1579892913.0,"No. You're just a fucking moron because you think identifying the general existence of change says something about the desirability of change in this specific context.

And your attempted language-love pivot is a failure for much the same reason. The idea that there are supposedly beloved changes in language elsewhere doesn't compel love, approval, or anything else here."
mildlyinteresting,fffv2qt,t1_fffaavh,1579892430.0,"Why are you talking about etymology?

I'm not.

The link isn't."
mildlyinteresting,fffuxr5,t1_fffrtev,1579892345.0,"Him: Fact is frustrating.

You: Fact exists!

Me: Yeah, that doesn't say shit about whether it's frustrating, good, bad, or much of anything else.

How is that not obvious to you?

You committed an is-ought fallacy and think it's some killer argument.

No. Wrong."
mildlyinteresting,ffepn58,t1_ffeg3bj,1579859156.0,"Descriptively noting that language changes says ***nothing*** about the desirability or quality of the change, which means your response is damn near irrelevant."

The bottom line is that ""electrocute"" used in the non-fatal sense risks portraying the user as informal or unsophisticated."
