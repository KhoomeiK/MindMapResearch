Right, ""supposedly"", from what Christians claim. Again it may be a case of the authors not really caring about the details and simply establishing an apologetic. 

>If Jesus had been made ""under the law"", then Joseph and Mary were married and fucked. Impregnation by a deity would have been outside of the law, including Jewish Law.

That sounds like a loose interpretation. Galatians 4:4-5 says ""God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, To redeem them that were under the law,"". Paul doesn't mention Joseph or any human father here, so I don't know how you can conclude Paul means Jesus's mother was married under the law. A plain and consistent (with Galatians anti-law rhetoric) reading would be that Jesus was born a Jew to save the Jews."

Matthew uses the Septuagint which says ‘Parthenos’; that does apply to a virgin.

Edit: I don’t think the Romans passage is talking about the process of conception. Remember Mary is also supposedly of the line of David and it’s not a leap to think Paul may be referring to this as in Galatians 4:4, Paul does say Jesus was made of a woman. I don’t think this proves there was or wasn’t a virgin birth, rather Paul isn’t addressing it here, likely because it wasn’t a belief yet."

However submission may be in the form of submission to the law and it's punishments, even if such a punishment is death. 

In the early centuries of Christianity martydom was seen as a virtue that allowed Christians to (sometimes literally) take up their own cross. Accepting punishment was not seen as rebellion, rather as an act of obedience to the Law and the courts.
