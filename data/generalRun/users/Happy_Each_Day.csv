Trump:  Where is my uniform design guy?  He designs the best uniforms.  All the other countries space forces are jealous, they wish they had this guy, believe me.

(minutes later)

Designer: Uh, you asked for me, Mr. President?

Trump: There you are!  Listen, you did such a great job on the space force uniforms. Everybody is saying what a great uniform it is.  Aren't they tremendous?  They're tremendous. I think that if Time magazine doesn't put me on the cover next time, and believe me, they will, because they know they were wrong - but if they don't, I think they should put your uniform on there, because everybody loves it so much.

Designer: Thank you, Mr. President.  I really can't take credit for that design - you rejected my first 30 proposals, and the forest theme was your idea. I really don't want any credit for that design at all, really.

Trump: Well thank you, that's very generous, and if you ask my daughter - she's very big in the design world - very, very big - she would tell you - and I know this - she'll say that I'm a very good designer.  Not as good as her, maybe, but almost.  Almost! Number two, but I'm very proud of her. Extremely proud.  She's very big in the industry. Very big.

Designer: Yes, Mr. President.  Will that be all?

Trump: Actually, I have one more favor to ask, and I ask this because it is very important to our great country, and everybody says you're the right guy to do it.

Designer: Yes, Mr. President?

Trump: I need a Space Force logo, and I need it to be the greatest Space Force logo the world has ever seen.  You're the best, and I need this to be the best.  Do you think you can do that for me, as a favor?

Designer: It's actually my job, sir.  You don't have to ask me to do it as a favor, I get paid to provide visual designs.

Trump: Yeah, I know that. But as a favor to me, would you provide a really amazing design? Not like the normal stuff anyone would get, but a special one, something that when people say it, they say ""Oh wow, look at that design! Is that the greatest?"" Could you make me a design so great like that, for me, as a favor?

Designer: Uh... okay.

Trump: Fantastic.  Beautiful.  I have a really good feeling about this one.  I've been a business man for a very long time, and I know when something is going to be great, and believe me, this is going to be so great... so great.

Designer: Do you have any specs or requirements for the logo?

Trump: Excuse me, what was that you just said?  Firemen?

Designer: Requirements, sir.  Do you have a list of things that you want to see in the logo, or not see in the logo... or a color palette, or any language you want on there, or... well, anything?

Trump: Oh, no.  No, I don't believe in requirements.  I believe in hiring the best people, and letting them do the best work, because when people work for me, for some reason, they just want to do their best.  Maybe it's because I'm a great leader, I don't know. I don't know.  But I want it to be a beautiful logo - a really great brand.  And it should be a beautiful, lovely, deep blue, like the ocean.

Designer: The ocean, sir?

Trump: Yes, like the deep, vastness of the ocean with all of its depths and mysteries.  I just finished watching Finding Nemo.  Have you seen it?  It's an amazing film.  Amazing.  And I think most Americans, if anyone asked them, would agree that it's probably the best film.  Maybe Casablanca, but I think Finding Nemo.  And I think when people see how beautiful and depthy and blue our Space Force logo is, they will be able to relate to it.

Designer: Yes, Mr. President.  So... you want a sea-themed logo to go on the forest cammo uniform for Space Force, is that correct?  Are you sure you don't want anything... more space-themed?

Trump: Oh the theme, absolutely.  Of course the theme.  There should be space things on the theme, absolutely.  But put something on there that people will recognize, like I was just saying about Finding Nemo.  Everyone loves Nemo, and still to this day, people ask me ""where is he?"", because that's what a powerful brand can do, it can stay in your head for weeks and years at a time. I've been asked by people not to share this, but we have people who are looking, and I can promise you that we'll get him, and we'll bring him back.  Trust me, we will bring him home.

Designer: You were mentioning space themes, sir?

Trump: Yes, but listen to me, what I am telling you is that it has to resonate with people.  When they see this logo, they need to remember it, and it needs to make them know that we are totally #1 in space.  Not just the moon, because everyone knows the moon, but all of it.  Like Star Trek.  They didn't just go to the moon, they were everywhere, and people knew it and respected it.  Even the aliens.  When General Shatner would show up in his rocket and tell some alien to stand down, do you know what they did?  They stood down, because they already knew that Star Trek was #1.  It was huge.

Designer: Ummm... ok, Star Trek?

Trump: Yes, put a Star Trek on there.  And it should have the vastitude of the ocean, because if people think of Star Trek and Finding Nemo, they will know right away that we mean business.

Designer: Yes, sir.  A Star Trek and Finding Nemo.  Any other requirements?  Maybe some things people might associate with space, like planets or galaxies or something?

Trump:  Not planets, stars.  Everyone, at one time, has looked up and seen stars.  Not in New York, but in other places, they have some stars at night sometimes when you look up.   Sometimes they don't, but often they do, if it's an important evening. And people love stars.  They love me, because I'm a star!  So put some stars on there.

Designer: Okay.  Is that it, sir?  Anything else that comes to mind when you think of Space Force?

Trump: Legos!

Designer: Excuse me, sir?

Trump: You know, Legos.  They have the space ones.  That's a great logo, the space Lego one.  Put that on there, maybe put it in with the Star Trek, I don't know, but Legos are a great brand, and everyone loves them, too. Many people don't know this, but all of our buildings - and believe me, I have many, many buildings - and all of hem started out as Legos, right in my office.

Designer: Space Legos?

Trump: Not always space Legos, but but all kinds of Legos.  All of our buildings start off with Legos.  And don't tell anyone this, because I've been told people get all upset when they know, but even right now, Eric is designing our next building on the floor of the Oval.  He's got Legos spread out everywhere.  Sometimes we find him chewing on them, and have to take them away, but Kanye once told me that every great artist has to have their own approach if they want to make great art, and Eric is well known for being one of the greatest architects in the world.  That's what everyone tells me, and so if he chews, he chews?  Right?

Designer: Space Legos, ""a Star Trek"" and some stars.

Trump: And don't forget, we're gonna get Nemo.

Designer: And Nemo.

And I think most Americans, if anyone asked them, would agree that it's probably the best film.  Maybe Casablanca, but I think Finding Nemo.  And I think when people see how beautiful and depthy and blue our Space Force logo is, they will be able to relate to it.

Designer: Yes, Mr. President.  So... you want a sea-themed logo to go on the forest cammo uniform for Space Force, is that correct?  Are you sure you don't want anything... more space-themed?

Trump: Oh the theme, absolutely.  Of course the theme.  There should be space things on the theme, absolutely.  But put something on there that people will recognize, like I was just saying about Finding Nemo.  Everyone loves Nemo, and still to this day, people ask me ""where is he?"", because that's what a powerful brand can do, it can stay in your head for weeks and years at a time. I've been asked by people not to share this, but we have people who are looking, and I can promise you that we'll get him, and we'll bring him back.  Trust me, we will bring him home.

Designer: You were mentioning space themes, sir?

Trump: Yes, but listen to me, what I am telling you is that it has to resonate with people.  When they see this logo, they need to remember it, and it needs to make them know that we are totally #1 in space.  Not just the moon, because everyone knows the moon, but all of it.  Like Star Trek.  They didn't just go to the moon, they were everywhere, and people knew it and respected it.  Even the aliens.  When General Shatner would show up in his rocket and tell some alien to stand down, do you know what they did?  They stood down, because they already knew that Star Trek was #1.  It was huge.

Designer: Ummm... ok, Star Trek?

Trump: Yes, put a Star Trek on there.  And it should have the vastitude of the ocean, because if people think of Star Trek and Finding Nemo, they will know right away that we mean business.

Designer: Yes, sir.  A Star Trek and Finding Nemo.  Any other requirements?  Maybe some things people might associate with space, like planets or galaxies or something?

Trump:  Not planets, stars.  Everyone, at one time, has looked up and seen stars.  Not in New York, but in other places, they have some stars at night sometimes when you look up.   Sometimes they don't, but often they do, if it's an important evening. And people love stars.  They love me, because I'm a star!  So put some stars on there.

Designer: Okay.  Is that it, sir?  Anything else that comes to mind when you think of Space Force?

Trump: Legos!

Designer: Excuse me, sir?

Trump: You know, Legos.  They have the space ones.  That's a great logo, the space Lego one.  Put that on there, maybe put it in with the Star Trek, I don't know, but Legos are a great brand, and everyone loves them, too. Many people don't know this, but all of our buildings - and believe me, I have many, many buildings - and all of hem started out as Legos, right in my office.

Designer: Space Legos?

Trump: Not always space Legos, but but all kinds of Legos.  All of our buildings start off with space Legos.  And don't tell anyone this, because I've been told people get all upset when they know, but even right now, Eric is designing our next building on the floor of the Oval.  He's got Legos spread out everywhere.  Sometimes we find him chewing on them, and have to take them away, but Kanye once told me that every great artist has to have their own approach if they want to make great art, and Eric is well known for being one of the greatest architects in the world.  That's what everyone tells me, and so if he chews, he chews?  Right?  

Designer: Space Legos, ""a Star Trek"" and some stars.

Trump: And don't forget, we're gonna get Nemo.

Designer: And Nemo.

Trump: Go make me proud."

Dude was straight clowning the whole game.  I actually felt bad for him.  He would be swinging at absolute garbage pitches - never gave me a reason to find the zone.  When he did make contact, he would dance around the basepaths like an 8 year old and get caught.  I was surprised he didn't quit.

I was up 5-0 heading into the 9th.  He didn't start laying off pitches - he started smashing stuff he had no business connecting with.  I lost 8-5 after he put up five homers and sprinkled some hits in with them.  I changed pitchers three times that inning - it didn't matter who was throwing what, he crushed it.

This post is the first time I've heard the term ""Demisexual"".  I'm saying that to help show that I'm not coming at this question from any particular perspective.

This is the definition of being closed-minded.  One should never pour cement around their feet and declare themselves intractable.  This is possibly why your friends are not happy with you.  

I think that it's sad that when one friend tried to express that you'd hurt her feelings, you chose to view that as an attack (she ""guilt-tripped"" you) rather than a cause to reconsider your own behavior.

Again - I have no familiarity with Demisexuality as a concept - I actually agree with you that it seems silly on the surface.
