videos,ffsytdf,t1_ffsb9cs,1580198257.0,"I'm with you, I've been in one fight ever, in school I had a bully, he followed me home all the time. One day he swung at my head, I retaliated with a violin case to his face. He left me alone for the following 5-6 years of school, I never saw him again.

I've never been in a bar fight, at least no further than being in a bar where a fight happened, and making sure I was near the kitchen exit in case it moved this direction. 

But I've had it instilled in me, if I can run away from the conflict, I MUST do so. Stand your ground is only an option if not doing so would likely result in my (or a loved one's) death or immediate injury. But if it's my only option then I MUST give my attacker 2 options: deescalate via debilitating injury, or run away from me.

It's like people with CCWs. If you're not threatened enough to kill the person, then you don't touch that gun. If you are threatened enough to kill the person, then you draw and fire with the goal of killing the person. There is no in-between, drawing and playing for intimidation is only going to escalate the situation, and if the situation can be deescalated it MUST be, otherwise shot until they stop, and if they live or not is down to luck. 

This is exactly why I never got my CCW. I'm not confident enough in my conviction that, should I feel the need to use lethal force, I'm not sure I could do so without hesitation. In my own home, sure, if you've come this far, past the doors, the dogs, and the signs of occupancy then you're either crazy or aggressive enough that I have nowhere left to retreat to, but in public I couldn't live with the over application of force based purely on the snap reaction of an adrenaline filled brain in a stressful scenario."

If you're ever in a situation where you must fight your way out of the situation then you should be doing so with the goal of debilitating or killing the other person. If you're not in a position where that's necessary, then your option should be fleeing the situation."
Ohio,fflhc22,t1_ffksswp,1580039637.0,"I do agree that the hybrid tax is largely out of step with the others. Though I think the issue there is the wide range of effective mileages they get. You can find cars up into the mid 60s, but you can also find some in the high 20s, which would be paying as much as I do in gas tax anyway.

Side point, the electrics really aren't paying extra in electric tax, both because the taxes on utility use are less than 10% in almost all cases (and don't go toward road maintenance) while the gas tax is almost half the price per gallon in most of the US. And the cost of electricity per charge is so much lower. (Paying 7% of $15 a month vs paying 40% of $90.)

Or do I just budget in a $6000 battery swap every few years, cus that destroys the car payment real fast.

We're close. A little better infrastructure in charging, a little better technology in both energy storage and drive power on the cheaper motors, and a little more falling on the manufacture and repair costs, and I'm in...

Now technically there's a difference between 5.56x45(5.56 NATO) and .223, in that the specs for the 5.56NATO allow for a higher pressure than the .223, so technically a .223 in a 5.56 rifle is fine, but a 5.56 in .223 rifle is potentially exceeding the limits of what the rifle was designed for.

Ohio,fco0gcr,t1_fcn9ync,1577821855.0,"To add on, to point 1. That $100 fee change is effectively only the tax increase on gas this year. When the gas tax change was proposed the estimated impact was $100 per driver per year on average. 

So it's not even an excess tax on EVs, it's still really skewed in their favor overall (since they're only paying the new tax, not the original tax + the new tax like the petrol drivers are.)

I do really appreciate you sticking to your guns with this guy."
Ohio,fcnzvf3,t1_fcn1io9,1577821562.0,"Gas taxes just went up because they specifically hadn't been raised in several years, gas prices have remained flat despite inflation, and cars are more efficient now than they were 10 years ago.

I think this makes perfect sense. If we want roads to be maintained then we tax, if there are users that definitionally avoid said tax, we apply that tax in other ways.


Sure there are tax inequalities, and income issues... But that's all whataboutism. The thing that matters in this case is road use results in road damage, which requires road maintenance, and there's no argument to be made that those roads should be solely maintained by petrol drivers only."

I'm a bum. I'll jog, occasionally some yoga or pilates, but that's it. I joined her at the gym one day and after almost 2 years of strength training she worked up to what I can lift without thought.

3Dprinting,fcav1go,t1_fcaq4op,1577577171.0,"2gal Ziploc bags with desiccant works better than a hard box. The slight pressure changes day to day in the atmosphere will force enough flex to allow air in and out of the box. The bag can shrink/expand a little instead of applying the force to the seal. Plus, no seal is perfect, at least the bag is a shorter distance to seal and is a tighter seal than most storage bins.


I don't bother with my PLA, but my PETG and TPU have done fine with a couple large desiccants in 2gal bags. Every couple months I throw the desiccants in the oven to dry them, and swap them out of the bags, just because I know they're not perfect."
