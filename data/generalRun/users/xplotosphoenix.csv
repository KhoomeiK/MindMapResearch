CasualConversation,fdzeltd,t1_fdx73p9,1578789490.0,I have tried and reached out. Several times over the years to no avail. We lived in different states (AZ/TX) and wouldnt have seen each other much and now I live in DC. My cousins didnt go to their dads funeral and I was hoping to see/meet them there. Lots of dysfunction there- it's sad.  I just hope that our friend who wrote this post had a better result.
CasualConversation,fdweffj,t1_fdvphdi,1578757854.0,I hate hearing these kind of things. When I was little (9-10 yo) my father and my uncle (his brother) got in an arguement and cut ties. Fast forward to when I was 26 and my uncle came to my wedding and I got to see him for the first time. Never spoke to him again as he passed last year and 20 years after my wedding. I have 3 cousins that I've never met.  Please try to have her in your life. You two shouldn't be punished for your parents mistakes. You have time.
dogpictures,fdily61,t1_fd2yg44,1578445853.0,Hi guys. Recap- Alice had her surgery yesterday and it went well but hasn't moved much since she got home. She should be just fine aside from the cone of shame....Thanks for your wishes.

dogpictures,fd4xcw9,t3_ek1msc,1578171998.0,I'm sorry brother. Mine is getting up ther in years.
dogpictures,fd2zobp,t3_ejxoao,1578153362.0,What's her name? I cant tell what else she is other than sweet little pup.
