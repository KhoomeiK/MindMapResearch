LearnUselessTalents,fdk143e,t3_els9n1,1578493447.0,"I used to do a card trick for friends that uses that same basic idea. I would lay out 25 cards face down in a rectangle. I secretly knew only what the last card was and where I put it. 

I would say something cheesy like “for this trick, you’re going to do the magic” then ask them to concentrate and point to where they think <last card> is. Odds are they would be wrong but I would pick up the card they pointed to and without letting them see it, say “nice l, now I want you to find <card they pointed to>.” 

Odds are they would be wrong again but I would pick up that card as well without letting them see it. Finally I would say “okay this time I’ll see if I can find a card, say <second card they pointed to>.”

The card I would pick up would be the last card I put down, the one I asked them to find earlier. Again without showing them, I would put that third card in my hand, then ask if they remembered the three cards. We’d say what the three cards were as I lay them down in the same order. 

I know it sounds obvious from this side of the trick but of the handful of people I tried it on, nobody figured it out the first time. 

The best part is that if they ever beat the odds and pointed to the last card, I could end the trick early and still have the one or two cards I asked them for."

But I was wrong. 

Now I’m really disappointed and have only myself to blame. 

Upvoting anyway because it looks delicious and you should be proud."
