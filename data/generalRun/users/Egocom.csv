When the stronghold gains a level it gives more powers, and for every player you add the power the party gains from the stronghold is multiplied. Instead encourage them to turn their keep into a compound/castle. That way characters who choose to spend the money to incorporate their own stronghold into the compound are responsible for raising the funds. Don't forget though, for every stronghold added to a compound you add the total price becomes (Stronghold Price+Stronghold Price)\*((1(+.1 per additional stronghold))"

Information on the commanders, their titles and troop strength

The fact that there is an unholy scepter the high priest needs for the ritual 

Rumors of a bitter rivalry between 2 of the 3 lieutenants 

Rumors that the arcanists have been working day and night on a secret project (they're drawing the materialization circle that will utilize the sacrificed souls of their child hostages to create a new arcane heart to power the failing spore grove they're occupying)

The patrol movements of the enemies martial forces

The location where the children are believed to be held (false lead planted by Drow infiltrator, may lead to ambush if party is too clumsy)

The drow are using deep gnomes as a slave work force. The deep gnomes are not enthusiastic about the arraignment.

The location of the chamber where the arcanists go every day (the ritual chamber)

DnB,fell515,t1_felcqks,1579224789.0,"I would call it an important step in the development of dance music, but one that's tangentially related to jungle. Disco>House>Acid>Breakbeat HC>Jungle is a thing certainly, but Funk can go right before Disco and no one would bat an eye. 

Hell, hip hop was born around the same time as disco, and is much more relevant to the evolution of jungle imo. Looping a funk break, proper MCs, Funk and Sound Culture roots, it's all there. 

Acid House led to Breakbeat Hardcore of course, but it wouldn't have if it weren't for the Electrofunk influence. Electro is a direct outgrowth of old school hip hop, only vaguely related to disco. 

 As I see it Funk and Pop led to Disco, Funk and Sound System culture led to Hop Hop (while both of them influenced each other). 
Synthpop  and Old School Hip Hop led to Electro, Synthpop and Disco led to House/Acid House. Acid House and Electro led to BBHC. 
BBHC and Italo Disco led to HHC,
BBHC and Sound System culture led to Jungle!"

mattcolville,fel2o0x,t1_fejg3k9,1579212746.0,"I'm not telling them what to do, and even if I was the time limitations would force the party to pick and choose 1 or 2 targets. I'm not even telling them objectives, I'm giving the party the rundown on what the situation is with the enemies troops, their size, their resources, and their leaders. Any target they choose is optional, and they don't have to choose any. There's no discrete missions like sabotage this, assassinate that, they know the pieces on the board and it's up to them to influence the situation as they see fit. The party asked for info on the enemy and decided to split into ones and twos so they could have as big an impact as possible. I'm not sure what even makes you think a killing spree is something that I've suggested to them to weaken the enemy forces??? The Drow have over 100 warriors, and can easily take down a detected PC who has no plan.

Alternately, why SHOULDN'T I let my party choose how to soften up the enemy as a run up to the main assault? What agency do I take away by giving them a sitrep of what their allies have learned? How does letting them decide how to approach the situation make the game less fun? It seems you're under the impression that I have a handful of missions planned, when that's not the case at all. They have the generals battle map. They have the spies reports. They know time is limited and decided by splitting up they can both more easily avoid being detected by this larger force. There are no rails, and I have no expectations about what they will and won't prioritize. Hell, they can skip it all together and use the time to cast spells, give a speech to the soldiers, whatever they want. They expressed interest in commando raids so I'm asking for situations and targets that would be in line with that."

mattcolville,fei46iw,t1_fed821l,1579129896.0,"Other than 1 character none of these PCs have even met the soldiers before, and there's a time limit of 3 days until the Drow sacrifice the children. They already have a diviner wizard in the party and intel from the elven leaders. They're pretty much hired guns at this point.

Plus the Drow are occupying the elves abandoned home, meaning the elves dont have any manufacturing capacity at the moment and it's a 6 day round trip to Talbot to buy any more supplies so that's out. At this point the elves are as ready as they're going to be. Hell, the elves are traveling to a new homeland and would have just dipped already had the Drow not taken their kids, so they don't have any motivation to invest themselves in the local area (which they're in only as a favor to the druid)

Also it's pretty much exactly like what Matt did with his ghoul PC, except the players have a number of targets they can attack or sabotage, and it's up to them to decide what sounds interesting to them and important to their character."

mattcolville,febdcpt,t1_feb4uci,1578957647.0,That's the lead in to our next sesh. Last game ended with the good guy npc leader asking for their help and about to show them the intel that he'd gathered so far. We play in 2 weeks and the players will each have a solo quest to pick their own approaches to harrying the Drow to soften them up before the full scale assault. They also have a handful of elven warriors they can direct and use as reinforcements
mattcolville,fe9zoos,t1_fe9nf96,1578942893.0,"These are all great, thanks! I'm particularly stoked about your idea of disrupting supply lines. The arcane casters maintain a portal to the city for supplies and reinforcements, so cutting that off would be crucial. 

The main baddie is the equivalent of a captain, and his forces are split into 3 platoons of 30 people each. One group of martial martials, one group of casters, and one group of support personnel. Further each platoon is divided into 2 squads, each with their own sergeant. arcanist & clergy squads, sharpshooter & infantry squads, and scout & engineer squads

Though there is competetion between the squads and platoons, they're absolutely loyal to the lieutenant that commands them. The lieutenants of the martial and support platoons would give their lives without a second thought if the captain ordered it. 

The caster lieutenant only cares about the ritual being completed, and would sacrifice the entire rest of the force to ensure it succeeds. 
I think I'll position one of the enemy scouts as an infiltrator, and if the PCs are glib they'll potentially spoil one of their plans. This will also give them the opportunity to capture said scout and interrogate them, leading to some potential for a moral conumdrum.

Thank you so much!"

 ""A  spell is a fairly standardized effect that has been repeatedly created by many Magic-Users. While every Magic-User must use a spellbook to store his magical knowledge—mortal brains are not structurally designed to hold this information—there is no set “formula” for any particular spell.

 Take the spell Magic Missile, for instance. It is a very common spell, especially for traveling and adventuring Magic-Users, but if you looked at the spellbooks of one hundred Magic-Users which all contain Magic Missile, no notation of the spell would look the same. 

Each spell notation is a combination of reference notes, philosophical debate against the universe, and gibberish, scribbling, all of which serves one purpose: To trigger a dream-state understanding within the Magic-User’s mind. Nothing contained in a spellbook is a “how to” guide so much as an
