AmItheAsshole,fd09qvw,t1_fcyxnp4,1578115729.0,"Sorry I used 2018, it was the most recent year I found with numbers. Even 61,000 deaths is still a substantial number, 45,000 is a substantial number. Those are real dead people, it is still not a marketing ploy."

AmItheAsshole,fcyi51s,t1_fcycuaz,1578080565.0,"It’s a little ESH, if he is truly giving her shit for getting a weekend job or threatening to break up if she does. If he is that guy, she might be better off with job and finding a more compatible partner.

She should get the job one way or the other."

AmItheAsshole,fcyeegw,t1_fcy7309,1578078888.0,"That is a risky maneuver, they could be deployed post maternity leave and now have to leave SO home with a baby. I’ve heard people say this and I can’t help but think it’s not a well thought out plan. My sister has been full time Air Guard for over 20 years, she deployed every year from 2-6 weeks. My family and in-laws always tried to find a way to help with her kids while she was gone. We were happy to help and she never used her kids as a get out jail free card."

AmItheAsshole,fcyaxza,t1_fcxu57p,1578077391.0,"I don’t think not meeting the friend is super weird, 8 months is not that long when she is only in town 8 days a month. A lot of new couples are in a bit of a bubble early in the relationship, where they are all about each other.

The moving with them is certainly unorthodox, but I could see it of the friend is trying to escape an abusive relationship or other terrible situation but it would need a ton of discussion beforehand."

AmItheAsshole,fcy4njy,t1_fcxqt2v,1578074712.0,That is a great “would you rather”question. People’s reasoning could be really off the wall. I guess the incestuous sociopath?
AmItheAsshole,fcy3pnr,t1_fcxegzl,1578074382.0,"I don’t think the different spellings based on language are wrong, I’m from a French speaking area and we have a lot of Marc vs Mark. Alexander probably has at least a few different forms worldwide but having both the x and z is a bit odd."

AmItheAsshole,fcy0oox,t1_fcx08en,1578073125.0,"There were 79,000 flu related deaths in 2018 in the US. The flu is not a marketing scam."
AmItheAsshole,fcy09h6,t1_fcx1tav,1578072873.0,"I don’t live or work in Europe so I can’t speak to what is practiced but it might be helpful for you to look into the number of flu cases/deaths in your country, the number I found with a limited search was approximately 40,000 flu related deaths in Europe each year. Most of the deaths will be infants and the elderly but young people that don’t die from flu are a source for spreading the virus to the vulnerable population. If you can do something easy and inexpensive to help stop the spread of a deadly disease, perhaps it’s worth it."
MtvChallenge,fcxtx5j,t1_fcxsimj,1578070406.0,"My post didn’t mention Joss or that daily. What I typed and deleted out of that comment was that your very aggressive tone is not helping your cause at all, you won’t convince anyone that way."
MtvChallenge,fcxrllo,t1_fcxps0w,1578069487.0,"Defensive strategy is employed in almost every competitive event and is a valid strategy. The football discussion is “does good offense beat good defense”, baseball has “pitching vs hitting” both continuously try to mess with the timing of the other, cycling and skating having drafting to save energy, people ITT have already mentioned boxing.  Things like bowling and darts would be more offense, those types of games might be more to your liking.

Yes, you keep repeating the same thing. People understand it perfectly, they just disagree."
MtvChallenge,fcxp556,t1_fcxmy4f,1578068195.0,"I disagreed but was following your logic until now. If a basketball team get bored on defense and put their hands on their hips or starts talking to the audience, they 100% deserve to be scored on."

Outlander,fcxjgbu,t1_fcx8ocz,1578064433.0,"Yes, but he is in America, in the South and there is a pretty well documented connection from Scottish settlers to the formation of the KKK. I can’t take the time to link sources right now, a quick google search will lead you to articles and documentaries galore.

I am not saying anything disparaging about Jamie, I am saying that I hope the show runners are able to work with such a sensitive topic."
Outlander,fcvcqjg,t3_ej2j4e,1577999362.0,I hope they can pull this off. I have read and love the books but that trailer just screams KKK to me. I don’t know if they can get around the imagery of a white man holding a torch in front of a burning cross.
interestingasfuck,fcva694,t1_fcv8sbg,1577997847.0,"I’m not sure inner city kids, the elderly, or people working multiple jobs would agree with the very easy to grow their own food. Even if you can, you still need to compensate for growing seasons which brings us all the way back to shelf life. Canning, pickling, smoking, salting and other forms of food storage have been around for centuries, efficient food growth and storage will become even more important as climate change advances."

AmItheAsshole,fcun4ls,t1_fcu3pkz,1577984551.0,You fall back to sleep quickly but if she has to wake you up 2/3 times a night then she is not getting much sleep. That won’t be a good long term solution for both of you.
AmItheAsshole,fcumuip,t1_fcu15ys,1577984394.0,"That will not help this issue, the noise is keeping her awake. Two beds, same room doesn’t change the noise level."
AmItheAsshole,fcumduz,t1_fcu4zoe,1577984122.0,"I work in health care with many patients that have obesity, AFib and sleep apnea. Many people are very reluctant to try CPAP due to the noise, inconvenience or just the thought of sleeping with something on their face but it is life changing when it helps. People often say they wished they had tried it years earlier.

I encourage you to push for the sleep study, it may improve your own life not just hers. The information will be helpful either way."

AmItheAsshole,fcuefmb,t1_fcubmsa,1577979001.0,"The general rule is return it better than you got it, when borrowing (Rentals, leases, purchases are different). If some one lets you borrow their car, filling it and even washing it are pretty standard. If OP couldn’t borrow it, he would have needed to rent a vehicle, Uber or make other arrangements costing him more time and money than borrowing."
AmItheAsshole,fcubc7g,t3_eittsu,1577976996.0,"NTA - I have Crohn’s and have had to restrict my diet, I would never expect other people to only eat what I can. Hell, I am happy if restaurants have anything I can eat without special ordering.

 Change shellfish to chocolate, should OP never get dessert? Change it to dairy, should OP never eat cheese?

In the specific instance of only soup on the menu is one she can’t eat, OP could have been more sensitive. It also would make more sense to go to restaurants that have choices for both of them."

The last couple of years have put a big black eye on women’s gymnastics in the US. Of course, not all gyms, coaches and physicians are monsters but not all cheerleading squads are derelict in their safety standards."
AmItheAsshole,fcsob4h,t1_fcs00g6,1577920985.0,"She is 11, she wants to do what her friends are doing. This is the exact time to try various activities to see where her interests are, it would be odd for her to worry about her social networking."
AmItheAsshole,fcsnfvi,t1_fcrzdcb,1577920367.0,"Cheering can be very competitive, and is a sport in its own right. It is not just sideline cheering for others “on the field of play”."

AmItheAsshole,fcrad6m,t1_fcr9x37,1577899081.0,"That is actually really relevant to the story, the way you told it sounds like friends lightly teasing each other. Cursing or nastiness takes it to a different level."

If everybody sounds blindsided this might be a sign of dementia or others geriatric issues, especially with a history of alcoholism.
