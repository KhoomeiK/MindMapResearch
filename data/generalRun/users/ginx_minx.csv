AskWomen,ffhxpud,t3_etn8am,1579958454.0,"They view me this way because when I don't agree with something I do not beat around the bush. I say it as it is and people describe me as 'way to direct'. I can take a lot and often forget that most other people can't. I forget to sugarcoat things and people take things very personal and see me as a 'not nice' person. I almost never intend something to be personal, people just take it that way by nature. So I come across as a 'bitch' to people that do not know me very well. Someone that does not go along with everything and that will take her own path if yours does not please her. Most people don't like this. I don't blame them, everybody just wants to get their way in the end.

It impacts me in different ways. Some people actually love being around me, because even though I can come across like a bitch at first glance when you get to know me they see I am really not. I am very caring and also like to be called out on my bullshit. No lying and deceiving, if you do not want to meet up it is okay to just tell me you're too tired or lazy to hang out today. Most people are taught to be 'nice' and tell a sweet little white lie. I do not and I hate it. I am honest and sincere and I expect other people to be the same to me. But it also means some people avoid me, and I understand. They are most likely the people that I would avoid as well."

Agoraphobia,ff6911u,t3_err86l,1579621973.0,"I eventually came to a point I had to, after a while your friends and family want to know why you always cancel and never ask to meet. In the beginning I didn't even understand what was going on so I told them 'I just can't, I don't know why but I am scared.' Ofcourse nobody understood and they were very confused but also caring. That was something I didn't expect. They knew I wouldn't just bail on them for nothing and wanted to be there for me. So nowadays I am just more honest. I tell them I am too scared or I can't yet. I talk about therapy.

Granted, they will never understand and honestly I don't even know if I ever will. They let me do it at my own pace. They know it is the worst for me, not them. So luckily they are patient and caring."

Agoraphobia,fegw8fl,t3_eoskre,1579103925.0,"\- Do you self harm and does it relate to your agoraphobia?

No, never felt the need to either.

\- When did your disorder develop? Do you know the possible cause?

3 years ago. I do not know the possible cause. It might have something to do with my father developing a severe depression that year that made living at home very hard but I am not sure.

\- What type of therapy/ medicine were you prescribed?

None. I have been offered, but I would rather try on my own since I am scared I might not be able to do it without medicine. I might however, if it does not get better. 

\- What is it like living with it?

Sad. My favorite things used to be going to festivals and restaurants. 3 months before I developed agoraphobia I went on a plane with my best friend to a party island for 2 weeks and just winged everything. It feels like I am a completely different person right now, which makes me sad. I can't enjoy the things I used to live for and that makes me feel like I lost part of myself and my happiness. Also, I don't really understand it myself which makes it even harder. I know that my fear is illogical and makes no sense, it's a shame it doesn't vanish after realizing this. 

\- How does it differ from social anxiety?

I for a long time believed I had social anxiety instead of agoraphobia. Because I was scared of going to social things, like restaurants or parties. But when I arrived there I was always very loud and talkative so I never quite understood. Weren't people with social anxiety supposed to be shy and silent? I couldn't care less if someone thought I was stupid. I like who I am, I am a funny person. HEAR MY JOKES! No, not social anxiety for sure. Just wish every party I go to had a special emergency room for me to fall back to if I felt like panicking and I would be fine. I also dream about the day teleportation becomes a thing. If something went wrong \*bleep\* I'd be home in a sec. I'd have zero fear, I am sure of it. It is not a people thing, it is a place thing."

I don't think there is anything in a relationship screaming i love you more then that you listenen to what the other people is saying. That you care and are interested. Sometimes that means giving a massage because you've heard them complain about backpain for a few days. Or maybe you run an errand for them because they've said they are stressed or plain tired. Goes for either male or female. Everybody likes being listened to.

Going to parties, dinner, the movies, group hangouts etc. I think after 3 years of pushing myself I have grown tired of it? 

Now I just don't really want to hangout anymore because I know the anxiety is so bad and it never really got less if I went. I've actually convinced myself I don't really need to be social ever since it is never a positive experience. Really hope this state of mind will change once I get the anxiety to reduce. I've given up on hanging out physically because it just terrifies the shit out of me and after so many times I just don't think its worth it. Really wish I would enjoy it again. I do miss it."

socialanxiety,fcmyt5i,t1_fcmxqj7,1577798000.0,"I think I get you. You can't really start a topic, if I got that right? Maybe if you talk a bit more about yourself it might also make the other person do the same? It is hard for people to reply to just comments. Like for example the conversation 'Nice weather huh?' 'Yes, it is a nice weather"". It is a shitty convo if it is even a convo at all.

But if you give more details there will be more 'follow ups'. 'It is such a nice weather today, I wish I had known earlier so I could have gone to the park. I love spending sunny days in nature.' This actually gives someone the chance to also talk about themselves. Which surprise, most people love. 'Oh really you like that? I don't actually but I LOVE going out to the sea. When I was younger my dad and me would....' 

Just my 2 cents."
