unpopularopinion,fg6japa,t3_ex60p6,1580569486.0,"I agree with what you say for the most part. When my dad and stepmom were together my little sister, step brother, and I were just fine. When we were younger we got equal stuff and attention. But as I got older my brother who had got to do certain stuff at that age (3 year difference between each) and even when I reached that age I couldn't, him and my sister got more attention because he was the oldest and she was the youngest. I was just the weird middle child. Me and my brother were really close and I hold no resentment towards him or my sister. When they split though, she still gets more attention and even if I waited years for my dad to let me do something she gets it as I do most of the time. She actually thinks that she should be able to go to concerts when I have just gotten old enough to and my dad is holding firm on that one. When she was told that she wasn't going to a Falling in Reverse concert 4 hours away, she pouted and whined. And she failed to notice that maybe thats why she couldn't go other than how far away it was. If you know about this band you know that the concerts can get crazy. I am even going to have to wait some more to go to one of their concerts. When my dad said that he was going to try and get tickets for me to go to an MCR concert with my best friend and they are our all time favorite band she got upset cause she can't go to it (even for us we couldn't get tickets in the end)  I know I am focusing on concerts but thats because it is the most recent of her being entitled. With 2 kids you can still accidentally give one more attention it is just less common."

The black parade is really just his best friends, his little brother who dies on the battlefield with a medal for that reason, and a reflection of himself  leading him to death.

 This would explain why his family cut contact, they did it because he couldn't save his little brother.

 In mama we here WWII sirens and guess what time the ghost of you takes place. After he got back he ended up doing drugs and drinking to cope the sharpest lives. Sleep was the nightmares and ptsd from seeing the horrors of war and due to his depression he belives he isn't worthy of sympathy and is very apathetic. 

House of wolves which was described as a seedy underworld bar is a reflection of one of the bars that he used to frequent. Disenchanted was him looking back on his dreams and the good times he had with his friends. Famous last words was his reflection, brother, and friends telling him he has the choice to keep on fighting and living.

 I think that in the end (not the song) he choose to keep on living to honour his brother.

Men can be slapped and abused by their girlfriend and the first thing everyone thinks is ""What did he do to deserve that?"" Not something closer to thats wrong but no its that he deserved it. If a man hits their girlfriend though even in self defense he gets in trouble. If we keep on seperating each other by our differences then there will only be more problems.

If a dude leaves you a note and flowers and isn't attractive he is deemed as creepy and stalker-ish. If a dude is popular, they're probably attractive. I will not say that there aren't shitty people who do dehumanize and disrespect women but it is the same for men at times.
