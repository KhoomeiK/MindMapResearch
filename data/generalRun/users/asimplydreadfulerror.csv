You have absolutely no way of knowing if that's correct.  You're speculating and we will never know if it's true because the guy decided to lie about his identity.

Also, there are plenty of reasons people choose not to date people who are decades older than them.  Perhaps they want to have a family and the prospect of having child with someone who will be a senior citizens before their child graduates high school isn't appealing.  Perhaps they want to date someone with a similar amount of life experience as them.  And yes, perhaps they don't want to date someone who is decades older than them because they are not attracted to them.  Secondly, having *some* standards and preferences for the age and appearance of your partner does not make someone shallow.

The vast majority of people would likely not be sexually attracted to someone 20 years older than them.  I have no idea how old you are, but do you find yourself as attracted to the average 50 year old as you are to the average 30 year?  How about the average 70 year old?  Where do you draw the line?  I would never date an 80 year old woman at least in part because I have absolutely no sexual attraction to 80 year old women.  Does this make me shallow?
