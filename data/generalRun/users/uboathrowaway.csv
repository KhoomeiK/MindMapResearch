depression,fd5kkuh,t1_fd5k6qz,1578178548.0,"I'm sorry. At least we can know we're not alone in this pain. I just watched this video and it made me cry bc it is so true. Depression isn't a malfunction, it's a signal that we have unmet needs as people. I think I need to find a group of people that understand me and spend time with them. It's just a lot easier said than done. I feel so alone.

I'm 19 too, and I dread the future and I dread waking up every morning bc I'd rather die than live to make money to survive just to keep living to make more money and hate every minute of my existence."
