SigSauer,fepnhhg,t1_fenm3li,1579325243.0,"Sig would probably tell you they have something special. I have an old, well loved and very reliable TA01 on my Virtus, and a Delta Point Pro on my Rattler. I really like micro dots on compact PDW style firearms. Personal preference.

The Rattler is very short, but remarkably consistent. Sig has been making great barrels for these. I put a high magnification optic on it one time to bench for testing, and depending on the ammo it was a .9 to 1.5 MOA gun. Serious drop past 150 because the barrel is so short. But the groups were tight.

The Virtus does have a longer op rod than the Rattler. FWIW."

SigSauer,fenla0j,t1_fenkky8,1579287105.0,"In legal terms, a pistol brace is designed to strap to your forearm, and allow you to shoot with one hand. A defining characteristic of pistols according to the ATF. In practice, many people shoulder the brace making it effectively a slightly less comfortable stock.

A stock is designed to go into your shoulder and is a characteristic of rifles. So, a Rattler with a brace is a pistol. The exact same gun with a stock is an SBR and requires a form 1 (if you're turning it from a pistol to a rifle yourself) or a form 4 (if you're buying it in SBR configuration already) and a wait of somewhere between a month and a year (mostly) for approval of the form."
SigSauer,fenjdeq,t3_eq459d,1579285949.0,"The pistols are pistols because they have braces, not stocks. The same gun with a stock is an SBR. The Canebrake is a Rattler with a fake can. So that when your can is approved you just swap the fake for the real and go.

FWIW I bought the Rattler pistol and submitted for the stamp to SBR it. I shot the crap out of it as a pistol, and loved it. When I got the stamp it became an SBR and it's absolutely brilliant. I run it suppressed with a Midwest Industries 10.5 in forend. Basically, I built a Canebrake before they did. I also have a Virtus rifle. The current gen MCX is really reeeeaaaalllllyyyyy good."

NFA,fenhg3x,t3_eq3shi,1579284765.0,"Yes. You're going to fill it out, and instead of running the form he's going to check box 20 in section B indicating that this transaction only involved NFA items which were approved for transfer.

This is simply to give them a form that showed when you actually took possession of your NFA items. This is nothing shady."
EDC,fendui5,t1_fen4i1s,1579282563.0,I will do that. Thanks!
guns,fen1i9z,t3_eq1one,1579274876.0,"Without a lot more detail there is no answer, and even then, this it's the internet not reality. What it's said on Reddit may or may not actually fly.

Contact a lawyer and ask for a consultation. Ask if they have done any work on gun rights or if they can recommend someone who has.

There are many kinds of commitment, and not all of them cause you to become a prohibited person. But you definitely want to talk to a lawyer about this."
news,femwwyg,t1_femr4s1,1579271745.0,The neighbors could call the jail and ask. It's public record.
news,femwt3b,t1_femr6qd,1579271665.0,"Depends on jurisdiction. In much of the United States, your charges are public information as soon as you're booked in. Most jails have websites where you can see custody and charge info.

For good or ill, it's to keep the secret state police scenario from becoming easy. If all arrests are public record, it's harder to make people just vanish. There are arguments for and against this system as it stands, but that's the way it is for the moment."
