dogs,ffqtatg,t3_euodr1,1580143152.0,"My pup has a bladder infection and was put on antibiotics last week. Wednesday night before our vet visit, it was pouring outside and he wasn't comfortable peeing in the only semi-covered area around. I sat with him for about 10mins hoping he'd pee. He peed all over the apartment that night. Just felt bad for him. He seems to be responding well to the medication. His urinations are longer and he hasn't had an accident inside since."

I live in a fairly small apartment community and see the same dogs every day.
