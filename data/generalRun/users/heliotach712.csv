The Shah was hated so much by the Iranians they decided to have an Islamic theocracy instead (Iran/Persia being historically one of the least Islamised countries of the ME and being resistant to a religion not native to them but brought by Arab invasions).

> expecting your loved ones to accept poor treatment and behavior 

Which is portrayed..where, in this post? Someone grieving a certain way when you wish they'd grieve the way *you* want or to not grieve at all b/c that's less work for you as their partner is a form of abuse, to you?

..I know it doesn't. The point was implicit. About how people expect OP to act or what kind of treatment he's supposed to accept.

> how does that change what I'm saying?

It doesn't. It's a hypothetical. The point is that you would be saying something different, if not necessarily you as an individual then the consensus here that you echo. The aggregate response (as reflected in a system like upvoting/downvoting) would be inverted if a female Op made an identical post about her partner not loving her anymore after she gained weight during a period of grieving a parent - the response would be *strongly* to the effect of, well, what I said it would be, which you seem to recognise. So having recognised that, which one is right? They can't both be, right? Or is OP expected to accept they can't have a partner who supports them even when it isn't easy to b/c they have a dick? If that's what you and the amorphous consensus of reddit idiots believe, I wish you'd at least be clear and honest about it. My message to OP is, you're not *obligated* to accept that this is all you can have or all you're worth b/c these are the upvoted responses when you post your problems to be assessed by strangers on the internet, or bc you've been conditioned by a person into a state of fearing losing them - b/c the person who conditioned you that way doesn't actually love you or have your best interests at heart."
DecidingToBeBetter,fe8t6xx,t1_fe8k27n,1578930552.0,"> You're claiming that OP's wife is withholding love from OP when she tells him she is unhappy with his current behavior and is contemplating divorce if things don't change.

Yes, as a method of control. That may work out good or bad in the short term, but in the long run that's precisely the dynamic it establishes: her controlling him by threatening to not love him anymore. If the current issue if resolved, that dynamic remains established for the future and will resurface again the moment she wants him to be act different or look different from how he is - why wouldn't she do it? If it's been shown to work - it's only rational from her perspective. I ask OP, is this a life you truly want, do you feel this is all you deserve? 

>  long-term relationships and romantic love, both of which are not actually unconditional nor should they be

Well literally the very idea of commitment is that you stick with your partner even when times are tough, not just when things go smoothly (such as when they experience loss and grief and aren't necessarily fun to be around). To reiterate, that's literally the very concept of commitment, as symbolised in the marriage ceremony which OP and his wife underwent. It doesn't mean it's always possible or that it always succeeds, but that is the promise that is made. 

I think you can admit, if you're honest, that a woman in OP's position making this post would face an overwhelming consensus of 'you deserve a man who loves who for you who are unconditionally kween, you can do better than someone who only thinks of themselves in YOUR time of need.' I know this hypothetical to be the case, I'm sure you do too if you're honest with yourself. YOUR comment would be downvoted like mine was if the genders were flipped.

You're telling me that a standard of expecting someone who professes to love someone to love *when they need it most* is too high, is tantamount to an adolescent fantasy? Sucks to be you, I guess.

They're also high in regulation, taxation (and consequent state spending on government services like healthcare), that kind of thing. 

So the U.S, *un*like these countries has church and state explicitly separated in its constitution. And unlike those countries, is ideologically founded in the explicitly secular Enlightenment/liberal philosophy from contemporary Europe that its founders believed in. And yet you have there very high levels of religiosity, religious conservatism, whatever. Think of how culturally anti-government America is since its inception. After all, the government is 'Uncle Sam', the same entity to which you pay your taxes when you draw up your budget - whereas people go to church hoping to experience something less..mundane. If the church was connected to the state somehow like in the U.K or Denmark, it would be seen pretty differently.
