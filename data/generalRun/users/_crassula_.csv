I love karma, lom, junk, smuggler's soul, cardamom coffee because they are just fascinating and calming.  Deep, dark, woodsy, incense scents really make me swoon.

A long narrow room where you can see the corners with you in it would work (maybe there is a cool hall/ballroom near you), a straight road or path with you standing in the middle (just be careful to not get hit), or maybe a cool alley?
