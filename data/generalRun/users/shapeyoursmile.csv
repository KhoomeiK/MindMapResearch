I wasn't even fully awake yet and nothing had really happened that could warrant a breakup, but yup, after class he called. It was such a clear, certain thought.

Also, as a medical doctor that has written a few of those requests you say ""wouldn't be stopped by ethical concern"".. It took me 30 weeks to get a test device that isn't even used on *humans* approved. Medical ethics committees are mandatory. There are no trials without them.

TwoXChromosomes,fdmj25q,t1_fdmhywu,1578551709.0,"In theory, you would be right. But two base elements of the path (nil nocere, do no harm, and respecting your patient) prevent you from taking religion into your job. A part of the revised oath was even specifically added to prevent religious interpretation: ""In the 1960s, the Hippocratic Oath was changed to require ""utmost respect for human life from its beginning"", making it a more secular obligation, not to be taken in the presence of God or any gods, but before only other people.""

As a doctor, you are to *care* for your patient. You're allowed to refuse an abortion, of course. That's not what I mean with breaking the oath on multiple levels. But refusing further care? Belittling and literally cussing out your patient? That's breaking your oath. It's also just being a very shitty human in general.

And lastly, let's be very clear about one thing - this is not about religious belief, it's about control. If that woman got through medical school with 0 problems with most of our current-day teachings; if her own desk assistants still call in a woman asking for one, not knowing their own boss *refuses* to do them - it's not religion, it's power. And it's disgusting.

(last edit - also, if one would be such a crazed believer, being a doctor in general would mean meddling with the path of God. It's horribly ironic to prevent death and calling it your job, but when the opposite happens, you're suddenly condemned to hell? No thanks.)"
