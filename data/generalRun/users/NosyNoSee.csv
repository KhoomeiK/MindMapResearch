wholesomememes,fendmgb,t3_eq0vt7,1579282428.0,"I have albinism. Suffice to say most people’s toddlers or small children tend to stare at me probably because they haven’t seen somebody who looks so odd(?). 

So I tend to straighten my back put my hands to my side. Then I’ll make some funny gesture. Toddlers seem to get a kick out of weird man funny face"

vegan,fedutcx,t1_fed1b5m,1579020358.0,Yeah I’ve been doing this for about four days now. After a few days I went and at some tacos close by and felt that usual feeling. My stomach is a little pot and I’m sleepy. So I’m really digging smoothies right now.
vegan,fed114d,t1_fed0rnw,1578993294.0,"So far I know one smoothie recipe. I make it with half banana and 60 g frozen mango chunks. Throughout this week, I’ve been switching out the mango for strawberry.

Apparently, if smoothies are made in this way, they’re still considered a solid food because the fiber wasn’t taken out.

I def wanna make different smoothies, but I’m a bit cautious of not getting the right nutrients since I’m not to familiar with this stuff yet."
vegan,fed0ksr,t1_fed07y8,1578992649.0,"Yeah I’m not using any store bought juice for my meals. Just oats, seeds, some veggies, one fruit’s worth and almond milk unsweetened and water.

I’m not even trying to lose weight. I’ve just noticed my body feels really good after a meal in a way I don’t think I’ve felt before even though my smoothies are 500 cal per meal: I’m not bloated, I’m not sleepy.

But I’m asking here because I can’t find any solid info on this stuff other that weird diets for losing weight with smoothies that have a bunch of added sugar and whatnot

Edit: thanks for your response. Forgot to type that lol"
