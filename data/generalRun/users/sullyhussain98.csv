WWE,ffab6d5,t3_esj6du,1579731469.0,"In terms of rumble that meant a lot it was probably the Rumble of 2008. Loved it, was and still is a huge Cena fan so I was devastated when he got injured before it. 

I liked the men’s Rumble of 2018, the winner was perfect imo, the final 6 blew me away."
SquaredCircle,ffa1pco,t3_eshkvb,1579726113.0,"The same way people still listen to R Kelly or MJ. No matter what you think of him, Benoit was talented. Now that doesn’t excuse what he did, some people, some wrestlers looked up to Chris. As a wrestler he may have been people’s hero. They saw how he took the news of his friend passing away and felt sorry for him. I can’t really excuse what happened though personally."

SquaredCircle,ff46dpu,t1_ff45zeq,1579556533.0,I think it comes from a place of trying to be unique and pushing the boat out there. I’ve not heard that before about JBL that’s fucked up. I fully agree with you it’s getting ridiculous. There’s better ways of being a heel
SquaredCircle,ff454qa,t3_erjxyc,1579555751.0,"Let’s put it like this, does it get heat? Yeah it does however to be an effective heel you don’t have to do shit like that. Also a wrestler should never lay hands on someone who isn’t in on it."
