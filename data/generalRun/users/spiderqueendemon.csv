He played Agustin Magaldi, got to do some singing and generally furthered the plot. So this is a common enough misunderstanding to have occurred before.

AskReddit,ffieff8,t1_ffgrjr6,1579971899.0,"I remember reading a book about Maradona as a kid and the book described how his playing style changed and became even more amazing when he finally got his first pair of running shoes, because when you're barefoot, you can't kick the ball with your toe, just the side of your foot. 

So little nine-year-old me went and stared at my shoes for a while, feeling horribly uncomfortable about being bad at soccer in gym class, because I *had* shoes.

But then I tried some of the ball drills the book described at home and got much better. The teasing stopped, and that whole 'use the side of your foot,' insight, which my gym teachers had never mentioned (I'm from the US,) wound up giving me enough ball control to make up for some other deficiencies. So I was able to keep up and be of use to a side.

AskReddit,ffhwfag,t1_ffh6yms,1579956946.0,"My favorite part of her story is how she had actually decent male allies in her life. Like when she and Pierre won the first Nobel Prize for physics, they were going to give it to just her husband at first, because they didn't think women were people, but a Swedish mathematician named Gösta Mittag-Leffler (who was an ardent believer in women's rights, added his mom's maiden name, Mittag, to his dad's, and was instrumental in getting Sofia Kovalevskaya a professorship in Stockholm,) let Pierre Curie know that the committee was only offering it to him. Pierre understandably complained and the prize was awarded to both Curies. 

After all, Marie had begun the work and Pierre only joined her after it proved intensely fascinating. They worked closely together, a passionate marriage of equals, and though their lab notes aren't exactly in a library, forensic analysis of their published papers and records of their teaching schedules indicate that the work was a very close collaboration, with Pierre doing less on the research side mainly because, well, he was teaching more. Professor couples are like that. (Ask me how I know.)

Then, the second Nobel Prize, for chemistry, a lot of people like to say ""well, Pierre Curie did a lot of the work on the awards she won,"" yeah, well, Pierre was frickin' dead, and had been since a carriage accident in 1906. Marie's 1911 Nobel Prize in chemistry came after she, a lonely widow who apparently needed a bit of a break from a life that by all accounts included work, work, raising her daughters, and more work, had been caught having an affair with a fellow scientist who had told her he was separated from his wife. You know, the kind of tawdry little sex scandal that today would hardly merit any more reaction besides some pearl-clutching in the flyovers, some paparazzi static for the celebrity in question and the rest of the world going 'get it, girl.' (Especially since Paul Langevin was a younger man and, well, France. Get it, girl!) Well, in 1911, it was a big ol' deal. Huge. And the French, despite being really hecking *French* about affairs generally to the *men* involved, yeah, women not so much in 1911. So that was a right little shitstorm.

The Nobel Committee couldn't *not* give Marie Curie the prize for chemistry, the work was just too damn good, but they didn't actually want her to show up to the ceremony or anything because *gasp* scandal.

Albert Einstein, among others, sent her letters of support and encouragement, she went to the ceremony, and the scandal was ultimately forgotten, especially after, when war broke out in 1914, she poured her Nobel winnings into war bonds, tried to hand over the medals too (remember that she wasn't even *born* French, but Polish, so this was some Immigrant Patriotism from someone who loved both countries,) and then spent even more money designing and kitting out little trucks with portable X-ray machines, which she and her daughters *personally drove into World War I combat* to help wounded troops. The men called these trucks *la petit Curies,* and thousands of troops were helped. After all that abuse, being dragged in the press and basically slut-shaming, she rolled into combat zones to help her adopted country in a war. I mean...dude. There's 'extra' and then, about three notches past that, we have Marie Curie, glowing slightly and settin' off Geiger counters.

The saddest parts of Marie Curie's story were losing her husband so young to such a stupid accident and then the slow realization of what radiation would do to people, but never being quite able to admit that her life's work could both save and kill. She died at 66 in 1934 from aplastic anemia as a direct result of exposure to radiation. She had lived to see the beginnings of the Radium Girls case in New Jersey and her friends had begun to die. Her papers from the 1890s are still too radioactive to handle; even the cookbook she used to prepare meals at home gives off more than enough to set a Geiger counter screaming.

(note bend, different instrument voices, cool techno synth tricks, etc.)

I mean, some of the greats of techno and prog rock, the people who did the best work with Mellotrons, Moogs and DX-10s, they did it because they just had smallish hands and the new instruments let them do the good shit comfortably. And also fancy shit. Like, watch Mike Pinder demo a Mellotron sometime. For a guy who has been famous since the Sixties for compositions for keyboard instruments, he does not have that big of hands. There's a lot of that. 

I've got huge hands (and the approximate sight-reading of Helen Keller,) but my sister, who reads sheet music like Lord Vetinari, her hands are positively dainty. Like a little girl's, good for detailed sewing, not so hot for the piano. Synths and electro keyboards solved her problem.

'Tangled', movie and especially TV series -Mother Gothel is a classic JustNo and another character is a fellow JustNo victim who later develops JustNo tendencies

'She-Ra and The Princesses of Power' -pay special attention to Shadow Weaver and the way Catra talks to, yet ultimately treats Entrapta and Scorpia

She sets up a rant at me about how she didn't have car seats this elaborate in her day, her boys were fine and if we think she's going to learn how to do all these buckles and clips, we've got another thing coming and-

DH just pops up like a six-foot-two gopher from behind her and goes ""Good,"" cutting her off right in the middle of the rant.

""So you agree with me?"" she exclaims happily.

""No, we're just never going to let you transport the kid anywhere. I was worried you wouldn't be able to manage the rules, so since you just admitted you won't, you simply won't be driving her anywhere. The safety rules for car seats are absolute. They're also the law. If an adult is caught transporting a child without that seat, without those straps, the police take the child to the precinct and the adult to jail, do not pass Go, do not collect two hundred dollars. That's the law. You take our kid without permission, you so much as miss a buckle? We will pick the kid up at the police station and you can just call your lawyer to make your bail, because you would have to have kidnapped the baby to have her in your car after an ignorant little tantrum like that.""

MIL looked like she'd been slapped. I looked pretty stunned. DH picked up DD, who weighed about ten pounds. ""Besides, she likes her car seat, yes she does, doesn't she? Who likes her astronaut baby seat? Are you the space baby? Are you going to outer space?"" And DD cooed and giggled as her Daddy made faces and MIL looked stupid.

I didn't know what to say to that, so I just went into the house. FIL was as close to giggling his six-foot-six head off as he ever got, slapped DH on the back as he came inside and said ""That seat does look awfully NASA, doesn't it?"" and then they proceeded to talk very seriously about the Mercury and Apollo missions to the very puzzled baby in elaborate detail while I made dinner.

It's never easy with JustNos. Not even dead ones. Keeping a straight face is often the hardest part.

It may actually be a little easier if you *don't* know anyone, weirdly enough. You can frame conversations in terms of ""Oh, I'm so sorry we haven't met, I'm [name,] SO has mentioned you often,"" and just act so subdued-yet-happy to meet everyone, so interested in everything they have to say, so solicitous of every possible emotion that they catch themselves wondering...why the hell *didn't* they meet you before?

Some of the out-of-town cousins from Mom and the aunts n' uncles' generation, we had to ease them in slowly like this, because Grandma had basically kept them to herself for years. Mom hadn't seen her one cousin since I was a six-month-old, with Grandma's connivance, and I was fully 30 the year she died. It all shook out in the end, but it took some work.

The choice you have here, and it isn't an easy one, is whether you want to be the one to do any work on it. 

What I would do is talk to the twins before the funeral, feel them out about their feelings on their extended family, and if they want to mend the fences, then yeah, helping them out would be a kindness and a mitzvah. You will probably need advice from somebody actually competent, like a therapist, Dear Abby, Judith Martin...I dunno. Not me for fuckin' sure.

But if they don't give even half a heck, then you are under no obligation to, either, in which case something that'll help with keeping a straight face is thinking up bitchy things the family *could* say, writing them into a 5x5 grid on an index card or in a little notepad, and keeping the resulting bingo card in your purse so you can quietly mark it with a golf pencil. If you get five in a row, four corners or any bingo conditions of winning, really, treat yourself to something you've wanted for a cat's age, and the nastier they are, the more radiant your smile will be.

It's like they haven't even lived through recessions and epidemics before, like anyone alive since the mid-Eighties has. They've forgotten AIDS, forgotten what the flu does to old people, they're ignoring the opioids. It's like they haven't been paying attention on purpose. Do they forget parents just die sometimes? Or get horribly sick, physically or mentally? Have they just spaced on the reality that sometimes extended family are not up to taking in kids when something goes wrong? That awful little statistic about how something like seven in ten Americans was three misfortunes or less away from living on the street? Nine out of ten American kids or less are three misfortunes or less away from foster care. Car wreck that takes out your parents, cancer that takes out an aunt, heart disease or dementia that makes your surviving grandparent unable to care for you, it could be that simple.

JUSTNOMIL,ff9fq45,t3_es7l6r,1579712042.0,"I empathize with the feelings of relief and frustration when an abuser dies.

That said, don't underestimate the potential for positives at the funeral or, especially, the visitation at the funeral home, if they have one. When my toxic-AF Grandma died, a lot of the family and even the friends wound up sort of sidling around one another, like we thought there was bad blood, then we'd start talking, realize there wasn't, not except for What Grandma Said You Said. 

""I never said that."" 

""What? But she said you..."" 

""Nope.""

*Long silence*

*the lied-to party glares at the corpse*

*the lied-on party decides to be generous*

""She must have been...confused, near the end.""

""Confused. Right."" *gritted teeth.*

""Anyway, I've missed hearing from you so much! How are the-""

And most of the whole abusive web just...collapsed. It's like the long, horrible slog in hospice where she was in and out of the coma was because she realized when she finally corked it, everyone she'd worked so hard to separate was going to be in a room, talking about her *and comparing notes.* So Grandma's was a lingering, chest-rattly, awful death in a lot of ways.

But her funeral? Still one of the best family and friend reunions in history. We keep getting together around the anniversary because it's such a convenient date, and last two years, it took until people were boxing up the leftovers to remember that oh, yes, Grandma died around this time in '16, didn't she...and we had a small toast for form's sake.

So that's kind of how I hope it goes for you. 

Oh, and if any of the sisters repeat something awful the deceased said about you, practice a horrified, stunned expression in the mirror and say something like:

""She said *what?* But where would she get that idea? Was she...you know...*declining,* towards the end?"" 

""The poor confused dear, that sounds like something off of a TV show. No, no, we've never had anything like that against any of you at all. Did her doctors have her on some new meds or something, because *that* sounds like malpractice."" 

""We'd been concerned that she didn't seem right for a while... No, I'm here to support SO and his brother...""

That way, you shift from villain to benefactress in one simple conversation. If the old lady died suddenly, her family may be asking why and experiencing complicated grief with a need for closure. Your adding in the experience of the old lady being 'confused' and some spitballing about why, that gives them enough material to change the mental picture from 'she was fine and then she died, why?!!' to 'you know, she did get worse after that rotten new doctor put her on those awful new meds, I blame that guy and Big Pharma!' then to 
 'yeah, but she was confused about a lot of things for a while, and she forgot a lot, maybe it *was* her time.' Adding in detail to form a more complete picture of the deceased, especially a really charitable one, is often the kindest thing you can do for the bereaved, and if being charitable makes you the bigger person, well, the happy side effect is that it also weakens the dead abuser's case that you were anything but nice. 

After all, you can afford to damn her with faint praise now. You're alive and she's not. The idea that, at the bitter end, our abusers are so worthless and pitiable that we found ways to say things that sounded nice in the surface to outsiders at their funerals as a party game would, I think, be the unkindest cut of all. ""She tried so hard, all her life, to be everyone's favorite."" ""Who could forget her jell-o salad?"" ""I remember how much she loved seeing all the family together.""

There are also 'bottle locks' with either three-digit combination locks or keys that fit over the tops of liquor and wine bottles you need to keep an addict or just an inconsiderate person out of. Parents in the foster system like them because all alcohol must be under lock and key and if the only booze in the house ever is the wine you're taking as a hostess gift, having one or two bottle-top locks satisfies the letter of the law without needing a whole locking cabinet.

I mean, supposing you got a lovely neighbor who felt protective of you, didn't like what she saw of MIL and called the tow truck on a non-resident while MIL was walking her dog with her truck left outside your house? It happens. Sometimes family friends and even kind strangers are more protective of our boundaries than we are. I especially wouldn't give good odds for the relationship if she tried to boundary-stomp over your objections and a neighbor who liked you and saw how frustrated you were reported an attempted home invasion in progress while she was banging on your door.

Put most of the money into index funds and money market accounts, one 529 for his college stuff, and he did buy a sensible five-year-old car for cash so he could stay in the same house and save on-campus apartment costs.

It's like your brain gets locked in travel mode or how reasonable a distance is reasonable, the relativity becomes totally subjective. 

I ran into this a lot with my parents before they moved close to me. We got into a horrific fight once after my DH and I drove up with LO to see them (7hrs,) and one day of said trip when we wanted something fun to do, we took a little side trip out to a small, children's amusement park LO was just the right age for (2hrs further,) and *oh my God,* you would have thought this was the most insane thing ever, just such an absurd amount of driving in the opinion of my parents whose commute was 10 minutes each. (Of course, they had invited us up for a patch of time including some days they both worked in the hope we would stay home and clean their house for them, so there was a lot to unpack there.)

Possibly, after the flight to Hawaii from the UK, a little hop over to the California amusement parks maybe didn't feel any more unreasonable to MIL than the two-hour amusement park run for my kid after 7hrs' drive did for me. Travel is weird like that.

...Another possibility that just occurred to me is that amusement park enthusiasts, especially those who enjoy taking children to parks and seek out parks when they're upset, don't tend to always think like other humans in terms of distance or appropriateness. It is a known cognitive irregularity, like...some devout rollercoaster people or flat-ride folks will have bad stuff happen and literally go to our happy place. I've been upset or grieving, gotten in a car and turned up at a park with my kid to just ride our brain chemistry imbalance out until life feels better. My DH knows after all this time with me, if something bad happens and I'm not personally in charge of planning the funeral, I'm gonna be at the nearest amusement park more often than not, making endorphins to burn off the sadness until I sort my emotions out. (Hell, I *did* once plan a funeral in a series of long rollercoaster lines.) He renews our season passes at one, if not two parks a year purely because of the mental health benefits, and it's actually approved by my therapist.

So MIL might potentially be one of *these* people, and in her combined grief and enthusiasm to share something that works well to make sadness feel better with her grieving grandkids, just absolutely crit-failed her 'is this what a sane adult would do' check, yeah, that's a legit possibility.

Which does *not* make what she did okay, *at* all, not in the slightest and your feelings are completely valid, but I would way rather see the two of you talk this out, maybe with a therapist as a mediator, than each have even more reason to hurt than the horrible loss you've both just been through."

Every mandatory reporter in that child's life will be spoken to, his behavior at daycare will be scrutinized, the way SIL and MIL keep their home will be subject to surprise inspections and the kid himself will be tested by experts, SIL may have parenting classes and support groups offered to her and, if his behavior is anything like you describe, yeah, there's fifty-fifty odds they'll diagnose him with *something.* Even a weaksocks diagnosis like 'developmental delay' that basically means 'give us our Federal money please and we shall give this kid some services until they're 6 or start acting right, whichever comes first,' can mean occupational therapists (nice people who come over to play games and teach him that we don't steal toys/SIL has to keep the house mandatory-reporter nice at all times,) speech therapists (nice people who play fun word games and sing songs/SIL and MIL will have assigned homework to do with him,) and even free local all-day preschool (money saved from daycare, anyway, plus a lot of municipalities cover the schoolbus for kids in that program.)

You basically need to step to the side while pulling them into the crosshairs, let them feel really happy about a choice they're delighted with, and *bam,* the JustNo attacks it. 

*Then* they can start to realize what you're talking about. What you do is simply shift them from the sidelines to the line of fire, via a decision they really like, so that it's their choices, their values and something *they* care about that the JustNo attacks.

It's dirty. It's not really a nice person's tactic, by any means. But if you have talked and talked and talked and a FOGlight *still* doesn't get it, sometimes an object lesson can work. God knows my DH had to snap my dumb ass out of FOGlight behaviors before.

So. Given that MIL's primary motivation for seeing her graaaandbabies is to harvest bragging-rights pictures, well...how do grandmas generally like kids to be dressed, vs. how do *dads,* especially dads who have just lately been shown popular screen-printing websites that do kids' shirts and onesies with fandom designs for sports franchises, movies and shows they love, but MIL is known to look more than somewhat askance at, tend to dress children? Especially if an excited dad is encouraged to place a big order of new shirts and things for his kids (maybe you, the mom, got sent a giftcard, so you have him place the order with your account at the t-shirt site,) the parcel arrives and is set aside, then sprung on him the morning MIL is due to arrive, so he can happily dress his babies in exactly the clothes he chose...and that's *not* what she *wanted* in *pictures!*

But they're clothes he loves.

And the penny drops.

It might or might not be an option that works for you. But this style of ""give him some choices about the kids, let her attack you for them, then calmly point out she's attacking him,"" that works like snap.

To cut through the FOG, just got to power your FOGlight on."

Advice,fembab8,t3_ept8lg,1579246993.0,"I would talk to someone at your school about counseling, see if therapy is available, and look into local resources for grief support groups. Local library websites will often have a link to, or Google can help you find, a special search engine called AuntBertha, which is a search engine just for finding local help. You put in your ZIP code and what kind of help you need and AuntBertha finds it. So that's one place you can try, either for low-cost, sliding scale, insurance-covered or Medicaid-friendly counseling or for free support groups where people who've had a traumatic loss, people with PTSD and people affected by suicide can talk and support one another. If you have a faith, grief counseling is typically free through houses of worship, though it pays to look up just how calm and rational your faith tradition is about the suicide issue before you even mention it. In my experience, the more progressive the sect and congregation, the better the care and support a parishioner grieving a loss to suicide will get from pastoral care. I don't know you well enough to make a specific recommendation except not Scientology.

Also, Reddit does have subreddits for exactly this sort of thing, I believe, though I strongly suspect IRL support would help more.

One thing I can say that may help to reframe things is that suicide, painful as it is to those left behind, is really not much different than any other terminal illness, like cancer or end-stage heart failure. People can get PTSD when their dads die of a terminal physical illness and nobody is horrible to them about it, so anyone being dreadful to you? Yeah, feel free to disregard their opinion as simply wrong. 

Just because an illness is a mental illness rather than a physical one, why should we take it any less seriously? I mean, if you came to me and said ""my blood sugar has been horribly out of whack, I get night sweats, I have constant fatigue, I have trouble eating and my dad died of acute hypoglycemic shock,"" I would be feeding you my last protein bar on our way to the best doctors you could afford. So why is PTSD in the surviving child of a terminal mental illness sufferer who recently lost their battle *any* different whatsoever? 

Spoiler alert. It isn't. 

People just like to say stupid shit like ""it's all in your head,"" and ""you just need to try harder,"" because they think that if they say that often enough, maybe it'll magically come true. Maybe, if they're just big enough dicks to people who are hurting, the people who are hurting will be quiet, and then they can pretend that person isn't suffering anymore, because, hey, they stopped making noise! It's a fundamentally selfish, childish and immature way to look at the world, based on two principles: 1. If I act like it's not there, it's not happening. Denial. And 2. If I deny that it can happen to anyone, it can't happen to me. Not listening, la la la, fingers in my ears now!

A person who says ""it's all in your head,"" or ""you just need to try harder,"" to a person with a mental illness is like a little kid, walking with another little kid, through a dark, haunted forest, with sounds of monsters all arouns them. The first kid says something sniffed me. The second kid denies it. The first kid says something is licking my neck. The second kid says there's no such thing as monsters. The first kid stops talking to them and walks quietly. The second kid is satisfied, thinking they convinced their friend there are no monsters.

Which kid is lunch?

Seriously. To say that sort of thing *is* mental illness, just a different flavor. It tastes like fear.

And as Sister Julienne tells us, people only ever do anything for one of two reasons: love or fear.

So you're in a metaphorical haunted wood of mental illness. There are monsters. They're sniffing you. A fellow kid in a grownup suit who keeps insisting there's nothing wrong, yeah, not gonna help.

An adult with some nibble marks, a flashlight and some stories of monsters they beat up before, though? Yeah. That's the person you need to find.

I just wish I lived close and could fix you some soup and a sandwich, tell you it's all gonna be okay. I mean, sure, it's gonna take a lot of time and a hell of a lot of effort, you are definitely going to need, at the *very* least, some sessions with a school guidance counselor and some supportive people who have also been through traumatic loss to talk to. It will be a few months before things start to feel anything like normal and then it will hurt again when you realize it does. It will be years, and part of you will always hurt for your dad's being gone.

But eventually, in the long run, it does get better. PTSD is like some kinds of arthritis, Crohn's disease or chronic migraine. It's utterly debilitating when you're having a flare, but with the right therapy, the rest of the time, your life is normal and the incidents where something sets it off and you vanish into the dark past, they grow shorter, less intense, less frequent, and eventually your incidence rate is so low, you're essentially asymptomatic and past the worst of it. There will always be the risk of a bad PTSD day, but with some time, some help and possibly some reasonable accommodation, there will be so many normal days and many more good than you can imagine from right here in the haunted wood.

So don't worry. There are others who have been where you are now. We know how to get out. Just come towards the sounds of our voices. It will eventually be okay. None of this is your fault."

Check your time logs from gaming and just try to go hour-for-hour, for one week, replacing that game with the class. It'll be a refreshing change, compared to your usual school where you have to go at the class's pace, and if, as I suspect, you choose a subject you like, apply yourself and take to it as well as you have your games, you'll be able to take and easily pass a College Level Examination Protocol exam in that subject, which, guess what, gives you the college credit equivalent to taking and passing a three-credit-hour class in it. So there's a bite of your college, done. If it's a subject you were dreading having to take next year with a teacher you dislike, you can present your CLEP certificate and your school, under Federal FAPE guidelines (Free Appropriate Public Education,) legally has to put you in something else.

A student of mine cut back their video games by merely half, swapping to Modern States, the MIT OpenCourseware and OpenStax dot org, and not only did they test out of two-thirds of their freshman year of college by the end of their sophomore year of high school, this progress caused their school to admit them to dual-enrollment, on the public school district's dollar, at a local state college, so they had their first two and a half years of college done on purely public money. Just dual-enrollment funds and Pell grants covered their entire undergraduate. They got their bachelor's degree without a lick of loans, and all it cost was half their gaming habit, then something like three-quarters of it during practicum.

Thing is, if these relatives and friends are willing to prioritize their convenience of not wanting to listen to Artsy whine over your well-being of not being horrifically abused by Artsy, WTF kind of humans are they being? That isn't empathy. That isn't logic. That's just 'the crazy woman is being crazy at us, come back and be her chew toy so we don't have to take her noise anymore!'

And you're a human being. It was never your job to be a crazy woman's chew toy. So those Flying Monkeys, yeah, there's a phrase we use for such as them that rhymes with 'duck' and 'cough.'

You have a perfect right, if you feel like it, to respond in kind and block them, prioritizing your own mental health, peace and privacy over their desire for a convenient human shield between them and the crazy woman. Hell, you could even make a schedule out of it: every pro-Artsy call or text gets another three weeks or one month of timeout for the sender. 

I empathize with your struggle in dealing with an abuser like your mother. People like her live to isolate prey, to turn family against one another, but the effects can't last forever. Sooner or later, narcissists always trip up. Either they fail to keep their egotistical little stories straight, they get older and lose track of which Golden Child vs. which Scapegoat is actually in front of them at a given moment, or else they simply start to slip and say just enough in one of their histrionic little tantrums that lets a target start reconsidering their whole narrative. So Artsy should enjoy her Flying Monkeys while they last, but she can't control them the way she did you once upon a time, and with the way this blindsided her and you got out ahead of the narrative and stayed out, the more she flails and cries and tries to make the whole thing about her, she may whip up some sympathy short-term, yeah, but the human attention span's simply not that long. If you stay out of it and let her flail around, making her unreasonable demands on others to get her her chew toy back, the better you'll look, the crazier she'll look, and if you can just ride it out from a distance without saying a word, she genuinely does sound bonkers enough to alienate at least some of the rest of the family. 

The phrase we always used was ""leave her enough rope to hang herself,"" though a less gory one was ""never interrupt your enemy when they're making a mistake.""

There's a beautiful old movie, 'Now, Voyager,' with Bette Davis, that was, ironically, my own JustNo Grandma's favorite, for all it depicted the story of an abusive mom and a mentally ill daughter who suffered terribly from her abuse. It might be a good one for you to watch if you can find it somewhere; it might be online, though the JNMom in that story does end as too many of us in this sub sadly wish ours would. Grandma lost her power over us when my generation realized she was doing it, that people didn't deserve to be treated that way and we decided we weren't going to let her. So we started to hold meetings on managing her and made working around her manipulations a team sport, rather than a potential source of family drama. Artsy lost her power over you not a few days ago when you left, but the moment you realized you *deserved* to leave and had a *right* to a better life. Every subsequent victory, from our retraining Grandma out of trying to make us compete by texting one another achievements so she never got any news first, to your capture of your documents and closure of the safe-deposit box on your glorious Liberation Day, it's all been gravy. 

The moment you say ""I am a human being and I will not be treated this way,"" that is the victory. Everything else is glitter, spangles, gravy and cranberry sauce to go with it. And chips on the side. Wonderful, awesome chips on the side, especially your Liberation Day, but simply declaring your independence, that's the spark of revolution. That's the independence of the soul. Everything starts with that.

So when people call and try to make you undo that glorious declaration of your independence, well, does America belong to Queen Elizabeth the Second yet?

(It doesn't count if they just decide they like you and you're still a human, cats are forever adopting people, especially if you act profoundly uninterested in them, which is perfect manners in cat society.)

In short, how awash in avian bacon would your area have to be before you *ever* considered taking them up on that nonsense? Pigs would fly? By the squadrons?

Yeah, so why *not* block them? You're a person and you will not be treated that way. They want you to act like you're not a person and be treated any-old-how your abuser likes. So don't even entertain the request. It is not at all unreasonable not to be at home to preposterous demands or to harassment. If door-to-door evangelists I know I don't agree with come to my door, I don't open the door. Nothing, not in etiquette, law or convention, obliges me to listen to crazy people demanding I do insane stuff to make them happy. Why are Flying Monkeys any different?

I am so excited for the new life you have made for yourself. Don't give Flying Monkeys a second thought. You have so much more to offer the world, so many new adventures to experience, so many new friends to make, and so many better things to do with your time, it was downright generous of you to give them even this much space in your consciousness. Shuffle them straight off the docket and go have fun, even if it's just a library book and your favorite tea. You deserve so much more than this, and have for so long, it's time you got to enjoy life a bit!"

Trixie's cut from the designs has been financing her clothes, the Keep Fit curriculum and her Sobranie cigarettes for like four seasons now, Peter is actually retired from the Metropolitan police to promote the brand to better London department stores and Chummy isn't entirely certain how it all happened, but is a little disturbed at how girls who pretended she didn't exist all four times she was a debutante can't invite her to enough parties now that she's running a successful fashion house. Trixie tells her this is normal. Chummy doesn't entirely believe it. Little Freddie makes her a mug of Horlicks."

The way they're writing her as ever-so-subtly insensitive to things longtime viewers are precious about, referring to Fred as 'the handyman' when she first got there, for instance, then slowly becoming just as attached to people and places as the rest of us in the audience are, it's endearing and reminds me a lot of the way they added Jane and Barbara (RIP) into the cast. And that dear little monologue on her first day about her time in the uniformed services where she was promised stockings at enlistment, but never got them and is now in the same awful knit things all nuns wear, with a cute little sigh, and then in S0901, when the box of tights arrive for Trixie and the nurses and she *can't help* but peer inside excitedly, that's just adorable."

Advice,fefexyg,t3_eoj7pv,1579054887.0,"Ask yourself, what would you be doing if she simply isn't straight? What if she's a bit Sapphic, or if she bats for the aces? The fact of the matter is, there's platonic feelings and there's romantic feelings, and due to factors completely beyond either of your control, sister suffragette is simply not wired to find you hot and hot though I am sure you are, you are simply not wired to appear hot, specifically, to your friend. This can happen regardless of whether a person has a remotely compatible orientation on the surface, simply because attraction is frickin' *complicated* for women. Guys hear ""oh, she's straight! I'm a cis dude, so I must be acceptable,"" as if they just heard that a woman liked warm colors and hey, they're red, when the actual specifics are more like a carefully defined range of Pantone colors, hex codes or brand-and-number chips for the custom paint rack at Home Depot. Guys think girl wants *red?* Oh, no no no. She wants a color value defined on the CMYK chart by not less than [intensely specific parameters requiring two pages and a color brochure to even *describe.*] And we can't help that. It's how we're wired, too.

So the very first thing you need to do is accept that this romantic incompatibility is *nothing personal.* It's not her rejecting you. It's not you somehow failing to be good enough for her. It's more like her having a port made for SVGA component video cables and your happy ass has HDMI. It's a cable conflict. Stuff happens. Your ego, whether you realize it or not, is taking a bruising from these feelings of rejection, and reframing the situation as a cable conflict, a hardware glitch or a similar ""well, crap, but these things do happen,"" that has nothing to do with you and nothing to do with her will help you to heal all the faster.

Second thing you need to notice is right in your title. You are 20 and she is 23. I know the last thing a person wants to hear when they're 20 is that life, which is already such a hard bugger of a thing and which has already become so different in two years is about to get so much worse, but if life were Dungeons and Dragons, a Level 23 character has so, SO damn much on a Level 20. The XP doesn't have a linear scale. Think of how much you've changed since you were 17, and then roughly triple it. 17-20 is what you've just been through, 20-23 is the experience gap between you and your friend by the dimension of age alone.

Now, there's almost certainly mitigating factors. If you've been playing life's dungeons on Brutal Mode and friend had a good, easy life set to Casual Mode, there may be some evening-out between you. But even if you are an orphan who survived being a refugee from a war and she's a poor little rich girl from a family of Hallmark Channel characters, the age gap is still going to be at least a little bit in the picture until the younger of you two is about 25. That's just neurology and there's not a lot a person can do about it.

So the fact that she's just not that into you?

It's not your fault.

The first, biggest thing you need to say and accept is that it is not your fault.

The second thing is that it is not her fault.

And the third thing is that this might not be a bad thing for either of you.

Let's face it, romance is distracting. You both are college students, about to graduate into a world with a rapidly-contracting pool of living-wage jobs, serious climate issues, a dangerously unstable global economy built on a state of fundamental income and information inequality not seen since the Gilded Age and parts of it are literally on fire.

A friend is going to be handy for survival purposes. A girlfriend-in-waiting, a girl you are crushing on or a girl you hope will someday see you as the exact shade of fuckable red her brain is wired to find hot (and who knows, in a couple of years, you might be,) is not helpful.

You're at a small college. There's not a lot of people, but at the same time, there will never be a better opportunity to meet people than in college.

If it were me, I would take the friendship long-distance and look into study-abroad, semester-at-sea and out-of-state internships, whatever best suits your career plans. Work on your future survival first, meeting lots of new people second, and keep your best friend as someone you text and write to. Just writing, not so much the calls and the video chats. If you two are destined to wind up together, the best way for that to happen will be for you to each grow, separately, become your best selves, and see how you match a few levels of XP down the line. It may be that you come back from your adventures and she rips the jeans right off of you. It may be that you come back and realize you've outgrown her as anything but a friend. Life experience is weird.

But you do need to get some. That, and distance.

You can do this."

And if they only find out with a birth announcement, well, maybe they shouldn't have been that way to you in the first place. Serves them right.""

The odd thing is that this wasn't my ob-gyn who said this, it was the grizzled old company doctor at my husband's work who was patchin' up my hand after a bit of an avocado-related guac accident. I explained that I had been craving guacamole and really stressed because any day now we'd be at the point where I'd have to tell people about being pregnant, then the darn knife slipped and he completely understood. Told me some choice stories of moms and MILs he'd seen in his family, too, good and bad. Doctors generally have no patience for that nonsense. Kept me so interested in the stories, I barely felt the needle, let alone the stitches and my hand works fine nowadays. You can't even hardly see the scar.

AskReddit,fe5rg98,t1_f9k8owh,1578873542.0,"It's even better than hormones, luckily. The accepted standard is to have a young, suspected-trans person go on what's called 'puberty blockers' starting in the nine to eleven range until they are of a sufficiently mature age for them, their parents and doctors to start them on a hormone regimen for their identified gender. A good endocrinologist does regular bloodwork to make sure their growth and development in every aspect save sex is coming along nicely, possibly tweaking a little of this and that here and there to offset the missing estrogen or testosterone as-needed, maybe having their nutritionist add extra protein or calcium just to be safe, and they develop normally in every way, except no secondary sex characteristics, not until they're ready.

And instead of going through puberty at 9-14, on their body's schedule, to turn into a being of a sex that they feel is 'wrong,' they go through puberty into exactly the person they want to be, in the 17-20 range, with that much smarter a brain, that much more of an education, that much more accepting a social milieu and, arguably, better conditions all around. But you don't get that need to 'undo and redo' puberty the way trans people who did it the old way did, because with understanding parents, puberty got set on the back burner until the young person knew exactly what they wanted and could, after years and years of intensive therapy, confirm that yes, this was definitely what they preferred.  


Plus, if they change their minds? There is no penalty, beyond the cost of the meds that far, for stopping puberty blockers. You stop taking them and puberty kicks in as-normally for your assigned sex at birth.   


It's okay for us cis types to be a little jealous. I mean, sure, I don't mind my assigned sex from birth, but puberty? Wouldn't take a do-over on that for a million dollars. Of course, there is that whole 'trans women being so likely to be murdered that 34 is 'an elder' in the trans female community' thing, so...yeah..."
JUSTNOMIL,fe5f8ez,t3_enmlp1,1578868767.0,"I thoroughly approve of all of this!

Sometimes hospitals have a 'grandparent boot camp' class sort of thing, which tends to be taught by an impressive nurse or Doctor of Nursing Practice. These classes are amazing. They go over everything from the latest car seat safety to why the shots are so important to just what can go wrong if modern safety precautions and parents' choices aren't respected and they have no patience for JustNo bullshit. The people they get to teach these classes are the strongest, most experienced baby-handling professionals in the business, they are the travel agents for guilt trips the likes of which no JNMIL can ever hope to withstand and they are there to buff new parents' shiny spines and put the fear of God into JustNos.

If your hospital has such a thing, and you feel comfortable contacting the instructor and discussing your concerns about your JNs respecting your parenting choices before the baby comes and being safe people to have in your LO's life, I just about guarantee that instructor will have heard it a hundred times before, know exactly what to say, and if you send your old people to her class, she will whip them into shape for you like it's her job to do it for your baby's sake.

insaneparents,fe4v01q,t1_fe3yqye,1578863061.0,"The money for the treatment costs. If Mom wants kid to go without the vaccines because of her beliefs, then she needs to front the cost of treating any and all of the illnesses her kid might get. It's like how, in the state of Virginia, a driver who chooses to opt out of car insurance has to pay a $500 penalty to the state annually to help defray the cost of uninsured/underinsured drivers purely to get their car registration done and drive legally. You take the risk, you shoulder the price of that risk.

And, sadly, not all vaccines are free in all parts of the US on all insurance. With good insurance in a good area, yes, many of them are, thankfully, but this has not always been the case and there are still people who struggle for even this most basic of healthcare access. I had to save up for some of the shots that were mandatory to attend college because my parents' shitty insurance didn't cover them when I was 17 and at the eleventh hour, a friend figured out that the health department of the state I was going away to school in had the meningitis jab for cheaper than the state I was coming from. So I went and got that with my new student ID and saved $127, which was enough for almost half a textbook.

A button springing bodily off of a button-down shirt like the tits have developed their own little Frederick's of Hollywood NASA and sent a little four-hole plastic capsule off to freedom and adventure is probably a sign you might need to check your band size and potentially look into having your shirts altered. It's not expensive, a good menswear shop can help you with getting work blouses and buttondowns basically reseamed at the sides to flatter your figure and also reinforced down the front in case The Power Of Breasts Compels Them. I basically buy secondhand men's shirts and remake them to fit myself, because thanks to these, I could dress as butch as I like and still come out looking like one of Bette Midler's Harlettes on the way to the tax accountant. It is a curse and a blessing, especially since it means I have figured out how to get pants with real pockets.

It sounds to me like the big problem here is not your ability to work out compromises with a fellow adult, but the fact that your MIL, instead of being able to laugh at bodily insecurities, such as our shit-in-a-boot society won't really let women of a certain age not have, instead immedately reaches for backup and demands everyone around her start catering to *her* insecurity, pandering to *her* emotional needs, and needing a complete hard reboot before she remembers 'oh, right, other people are people, too.'

That is...not optimal.

The reason why I am able to speak so frankly about my sweater accessories, which are both asset and liability given that I work as a teacher and yeah, you cannot imagine the awkwardness the last time Boob NASA launched a Button Lander to the back of the room, is because my mother, also an amply-bosomed lady, and my grandmother, who was the victim of 1920s fashions that so damaged her chest that she ultimately had to have breast reduction surgery as a reconstructive measure because the binders popular with flappers when she was a young girl were so bigod awful for the Cooper's ligaments and yeah, throwing the kind of genetics we have on top of a wrecked foundation? The phrase 'bowling ball in a sock' is how Mom described it. Grandma used to buy her foundation garments custom made and costing into the hundreds of dollars in 1960s money, to hear Mom tell it. She insisted her younger sisters have the best, most supportive bras money could buy, took Mom and the aunts for proper fittings and had them taught at the boutiques to *do* proper fittings in case their circumstances were ever reduced to buying off the rack, and considering what a raving JustNo she was, in this department, she wasn't bad.

So Mom, who had this kind of a family background breathing down her neck and the literal 1980s and 90s in front of her, well, she decided her daughters would take it a step further. We would not be ashamed of our bodies, we would not be made to feel lesser for being women, and we would have female role models of all body types.

Since you have a SD in the picture, I'll share some of Mom's greatest hits:

'Designing Women' is a show you can currently find on Hulu. It is the story of four white women and one Black man who run an interior decorating firm, are friends, and cope with various life struggles starting in about 1988. Like 'The Golden Girls,' which is also great, it was shockingly progressive for its' day, though some episodes have definitely aged better than others. One episode in particular deals with a small-chested member of the group contemplating breast implants for herself, taking increasingly over-the-top pairs of falsies for test drives and discussing the ways women's bodies are treated by society with the friends. Another episode deals with fatphobia and whether an objectively gorgeous former beauty queen was suddenly ugly simply because she had hit her forties and gained some weight. It's interesting, both for the content and as a period piece.

'9 to 5' starring Dolly Parton. Lord, my Mom had this movie on often enough for us to just about memorize it. Actually, scratch that, you put on anything with our girl Dolly, from '9 to 5' to 'Best Little Whorehouse in Texas' to 'Steel Magnolias' to her new 'Heartstrings' series on Netflix and it'll help SD. Dolly is her own woman. She looks how she wants to look, sings how she wants to sing, writes what she wants to write and nobody can say thing one about how she looks that she hasn't said first, funnier and louder. Any time I feel insecure because the dryer done shrunk my jeans or my stupid uterus is throwing a menstruation bloat code and my knit T-shirts have gone from 'housewife' to 'Playmate' again, I just think to myself, ""what would Dolly do?"" and next thing you know, I'm dressed, I'm happy, I'm singing along with the Lady of Tennessee and my husband is adding 'pick up chocolate' to the Google Keep list, 'cause after fourteen years together, the boy is trained.

You don't need any advice from me or anybody on how to manage. You're secure in your own womanhood, you know who you are, you know what you're about and you're either happy or on the way to being happy in your own clothes. Any changes to your clothes that you make for MIL's sake, that's an act of kind generosity to an insecure old biddy who's been through a loss lately, whom the Littlest Angel chose not to bless as much as some of the rest of us ('Designing Women,' season 3, episode 5,) and whom you can still see the good in, despite her crossing a line most women of our generation consider a hard hell-no boundary.

That takes a lot of heart, and a lot of kindness. You're a very good person to do something that nice for someone who asked something that wildly out of line.

If it were me, I would consider whether, given she's been through a loss recently and has some insecurity issues generally as well as body image specifically, she might enjoy some stories of female friendship such as the movies and TV shows I mentioned above, and if said media happens to contain positive messages that inspire her to greater self-confidence and ultimately make her easier for you to deal with, well...is it your fault if a wholesome bowl of breakfast cereal also has raisins to help make the poop come out the person? No. It just comes out of the box that way. And lots of people recommend shows to their moms and MILs, or remind them of a show they liked long ago and set them up with a streaming service to watch it on. Not your fault if a show she watches helps her rethink some things and gain some much-needed self-confidence. Especially since she'd have to like it and watch lots of it for any lesson raisins to work their magic. 

My mom and I recommend shows to one another all the dang time and the other day my little one had me put on a cartoon she likes that had a princess being frustrated with her mom the queen not letting her do something. And my little five-year-old *stared* at me. ""Is this about the kitchen knives?"" ""Yes.""

So kid's subtlety needs sone work, and I've ordered some chainmail cutting gloves from the restaurant place. It's still a system.

But yeah, sharing media you like that you know a person you love will like, and which may or may not also be a balm on a wound you can tell they have? That's just how family does."
