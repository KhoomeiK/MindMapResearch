I normally like a super casual style, but for some reason I think you might look really good with a ""sharper"" style.

Nothing over the top, but maybe a brighter t-shirt and some better fitted clothes generally. You're quite good looking, the drab clothes kind of drown you out. 

Maybe something to think about."
YouShouldKnow,ffvaxgr,t1_ffv544k,1580259828.0,"I'm not saying this is some genius idea - I just think it's a good concept to be aware of. In an emergency, any attention is good attention, get the attention however feels safest. 

Overall the main benefit of this method is that it relieves the victim of some of the burden of reaching out. It puts the burden on the security people to initiate communication and figure out what's going on. 

And I don't think they'd take a minor away from the parents for a pat-down.

But an 18+ person being trafficked would at least be able to ask for help safely in private, like [this girl](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/flight-attendant-saves-girl-human-trafficking-note/) ended up doing.  

When your abuser is next to you, they've threatened you, and you've having a full on hands-shaking terror attack, it takes a pretty strong presence of mind to ask for help. More than I'd expect of most kids/young adults. Read about [Elizabeth Smart's near-rescue](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-utah-trial/elizabeth-smart-says-policeman-almost-found-her-idUSTRE6A84PE20101109)."
YouShouldKnow,ffv3agw,t1_ffuzsig,1580254680.0,"Serious question, have you - or anyone you've ever been close to - been in an abusive, controlling relationship? 

Why didn't [this girl](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/flight-attendant-saves-girl-human-trafficking-note/) just ask for help? Why didn't Elizabeth Smart simply remove her veil [when asked by a police officer](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-utah-trial/elizabeth-smart-says-policeman-almost-found-her-idUSTRE6A84PE20101109)? 

""Salt Lake City homicide detective approached Smart, saying he was “looking for Elizabeth Smart,” and asked her to remove her veil.

Mitchell (her captor) told the detective that the veil was part of their religion and could not be removed. Ultimately, Smart said, the detective was convinced and left the library.""

Look, this is a terrifying situation to be in. The victims are not thinking rationally. 

Especially if the people involved are you family, and they've conditioned you your whole life to just do as your told, ""or else"". What if you've been told your whole life, ""no one will believe you.""

Obviously if a panicked, trafficked child/YA has the confidence, and presence of mind, to assert their needs to a random security guard, in a noisy, distracted environment, over the protests and threats of their abusers, that's *fantastic*. Just great. They should totally do that, 100%. 

I just don't think that's realistic to treat that as an expected default. That's just not realistic. 

I think that kid would be much more willing/able to take the *very simple step* of getting themselves flagged in security and attracting a LOT of attention in a tightly controlled situation where their abusers have less power, proportionately. 

The more options they have, the better."
YouShouldKnow,ffuybo4,t1_ffussth,1580251674.0,"Well, a few things, just IMO - 

It probably wouldn't be in private, they're going to have a parent present if they pat down a minor, so that part's unrealistic. 

That said, the parent can't just drag the kid away - security is there, and they are directly accountable in a way a random security person is not. No one's going anywhere until they have *some* plausible story.

More eyes will be on the situation, so more likely someone will realize what's going on and step up. As opposed to a single random security person. I believe TSA ppl are also trained to watch for trafficking. 

Intentionally getting caught up in security is a really *weird* thing to do, and suggests the kid is really desperate and scared - it's more likely to get attention than a random outburst. It would get my attention."

LateStageCapitalism,fdxrye8,t1_fdxo8l3,1578772298.0,"I get it - again, I pretty much agree with all your points and complaints. 

As for ""the fee system being capitalism"" - yeah, we're making the same point. 

I'm just taking it one step further, and saying that existing capitalist structures (which we can't do anything about) *already* prohibit ownership for the most vulnerable, *even apart from* the fee system. 

And the *costs* of the additional cars would be borne almost exclusively by the poorest. Guess who's going to live next to those disgusting roads? Guess who is still going to be stuck on shitty public transport?

So it doesn't really increase ""fairness"" to allow the next-wealthiest group the freedom to poo more freely on the poor. IMO."
LateStageCapitalism,fdxnzt5,t1_fdxks7d,1578771080.0,"I guess I'm just not very sympathetic to people who want to pollute for fun/status complaining about ""fairness"". 

What I hear is in this argument is, ""Well *I* could own a car if the permits weren't around, so *that* would be a fairer system. Forget about the people who still can't afford a car, *that's their fault for being poor*."" 

Never mind that capitalism is just as arbitrary as the fee system, it's 95% based on parentage and zip code. The limitations imposed by the market are just as meaningless as the government ones. 

So IMO the one that makes sense is the one that results in better outcomes for all. Less pollution, congestion, and better public transit for all based on usage. 

And added tax revenue for public goods.

climatechange,fdxh8j8,t3_ena4zw,1578768694.0,"Their point doesn't really make sense. The risk posed by Chernobyl wasn't [species collapse](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/report-million-extinctions-and-ecological-collapse-are-way), it was cancer from long-term exposure in a small geographic area. 

That's like saying ""my friend recovered after a stomach flu, so car accidents can't kill you, the human body heals itself!""

To the bigger point of ""nature will bounce back"", yeah, it will. It only took a few million years after each of the previous extinctions.

The issue isn't whether life on earth will survive - it will, in some form. 

The issue is how climate change is going to impact *life as we know it.* 

For example, check out the [history of the dust bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl), and how poor farming methods caused it. 

And that was before we has access to full modern industry/scale. We can do so much more than just erode topsoil now.

At *worst*, we're looking at [the end of life in the oceans](https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/ocean-coasts-education-resources/ocean-acidification), which produce our oxygen. Already 30% more acidic than 200 years ago! It's literally dissolving sealife.

LateStageCapitalism,fdx086p,t1_fdwtndm,1578764004.0,"I agree that public spaces being reserved *exclusively* for the rich (not public at that point) would be terrible. I'm not clear on what's happening with the boats. It makes me think of this [episode from NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/01/25/688385893/episode-890-the-division-problem). Dividing things fairly is really hard. 

But that's not what I understand is happening in Singapore. Buses, taxis, and trucks/commerce still all use the roads. A more accurate comparison might be charging more for car passes than day passes in public parks.... which is exactly how it usually works.

Frankly if it was (1) free to bus to national parks, vs $1,000/day to drive in, (2) public transit was good, and (3) the fees were used for good nature/conservation efforts - AND (4) the number of drivers weren't impacting the quality of the experience (crowding, pollution), I would be 100% in favor of such a system. 

I want a free park,  more people accessing the park, fewer cars, and more money flowing into the park's budget. 

I never used to understand Republicans' criticism that leftists (I consider myself one) thought with their feelings. But this knee-jerk ""but it's not *fair""* response has me really examining a lot. Fair to WHOM? The upper middle class? The poor that you want to live in their cars??

Anyway, I appreciate the convo, even if we'll never agree."
LateStageCapitalism,fdwtcqe,t1_fdt8t6b,1578762142.0,"I kind of resent it getting personal. At my poorest, I was splitting a $500 room in the Bronx, and I grew up in poverty in a car-only area in the deep south. My FAFSA freshman year was $16k for a family of 3. I'm not ""imagining"" anything, I lived it for many years, in several different geographies. Just FYI.  

I think people demanding unrealistic solutions is worse than the actual predator class - they pretend to seek solutions, but don't actually deliver any help to the people who need it most. It's so much easier to find fault and complain than deal with reality as we find it. 

Car ownership isn't free either. Maybe you lucked out with your car, but most $700 cars (I've driven plenty of them) require frequent expensive maintenance/repairs, not to mention insurance, registration, gas, and parking fees. 

I still haven't heard an actual *reasoned* response to any of my points, just a bunch of complaints that I don't even disagree with. Yeah, that's all shitty, obviously. 

I'm not even defending Singapore, I just don't think it's unreasonable per se. A lot depends on stuff I don't know, like exactly how the tax money is spent, and how the density is distributed. 

Overall, I think renting public spaces to the rich at exorbitant prices is a pretty easy way to make money."
LateStageCapitalism,fdsvqe2,t1_fdsg2ze,1578708560.0,"I think I see what you mean, and still mostly disagree. I would be on board with need-based-only car permits though, that'd be great.  

I guess the thing I'm really unclear on with your view is why the poor are a part of your argument at all. The car tax is irrelevant for poor people. Existing market forces  (parking, repairs, tolls, hard driving) already discourage the poor from cars in cities. The high car tax doesn't ever come into play for them. This isn't about the poor. 

If *anything*, the tax causes public services to be of higher quality than if more people owned cars, because EVERYONE is forced to take them. Have you ever tried public transport in a car-heavy city like ATL or LA? It's a nightmare/joke. 

Class warfare is letting public services degrade because only poor people use them. Force the middle-class into public transit, and everything gets better.

If we accept the view, that (1) the poor aren't getting cars regardless of the tax, and (2)  more people on public transit is good for the poor, then the objection to the high car tax is basically:

""This makes it too hard for middle-class people to own unnecessary cars."" 

So... now we're trying to defend upper-middle class people's right to conspicuous consumption and pollution? Is that the outcome we want? I don't believe it is. 

IMO this tax issue is basically middle-class people wanting the rights of the upper class. They're painting themselves as the victims, and aligning themselves with the poor whom they don't hesitate to exploit whenever it's convenient. It's pathological.

LateStageCapitalism,fds53rq,t1_fdrzi4r,1578694553.0,"It takes a lot of gall (or maybe ignorance) to advocate for a policy that bould benefit the upper middle class, while claiming it's for ""the poor"". Pure whitewashing.

Please explain to me - how are ""the poor"" bearing 100% of the rationing burden when the rich are (apparently) being taxed $10'sk per car, and public transit is dirt cheap?

IMO the ""poor"" aren't bearing any ""burden"" at all - a decision has been made for them that results in a pretty good result for everyone, including non-car-owners. That's just good public policy. I've been poor, I was *thankful* for good public transit, not resentful of it. That's how urban settings work.

But really, this isn't about ""the poor"" at all. Not about ""muh victimizashun"", one might say.

Car ownership in Singapore could double (from 12% to 24%) and ""the poor"" probably wouldn't see any of it.  Safe to say if 75% of people can't afford a car, the poor will be among that 75%.

So IMO this isn't about poor people. It's about middle-class people wanting to spend more on status. ""We also want the freedom to pollute, we want the freedom to be as big a jerk as the rich people - it's the principle of the matter!"" is all I'm hearing.

Also, I don't give a hoot about ""muh markets"".

I care about policies that result in better quality of life for those involved, particularly the more vulnerable.

Edit: 

It's also worth pointing out that the poor are the most vulnerable to urban pollution. More cars on the road = more asthma/etc for people living near traffic, etc. 

Rich people will just buy houses further away from the pollution.
