Hundreds of people gathered by the lake, in winter coats, drinking coffee to stay warm.  Spencer got up on a ladder with a megaphone and told us to disrobe and it was SO COLD!  He shot a couple of different poses and that was it.  But I will say...it was totally bizarre being naked with that many people...you didn’t quite know where to look!"
