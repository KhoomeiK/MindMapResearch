miamidolphins,ffhaf1p,t1_ffggjtf,1579927846.0,He's also not any more valuable just because he was decent in college. Matt Leinart anyone? Every year one QB gets hyped to the max and then the best QB of the draft ends up being some random one that wasn't in the spotlight.
miamidolphins,ffha5ik,t3_et9xmc,1579927606.0,The Catch is so overrated.
miamidolphins,ffha1la,t1_ffh6959,1579927506.0,"Ballage and Drake were mediocre at best. You need talent at RB just like you do any other position. Watch sponsored-by-Butterfingers Drake drop crucial passes and fumble for no reason and watch Ballage the first legally blind RB. I agree we need to fix the line but I believe we might be better off going through FA for them given our weak history of drafting O linemen. 

At 26 the best O linemen are probably going to be off the board, leaving second round talent to be drafted. It won't make second round talent better if you draft them in the first. It doesn't really make sense to not draft a good RB if he's available just because it's the first round. CMC was drafted 8th overall and I'd be ecstatic to have him.  Mark Ingram was a first round pick and I'd take him too. Conventional wisdom says don't draft a RB but our first round isn't conventional and that pick is near enough to a second round pick anyway."

miamidolphins,ffh0g8s,t1_ffgtw6s,1579919792.0,"A possibility but RBs definitely impact the game at a high level. I don't know if you watched the Titans or 49ers this offseason. We currently have a stable of nobodies and our leading rusher was our QB with 250 yards. RB is a pretty big need for us. We haven't had a dominant rusher since what, Ronnie Brown? Maybe Lamar Miller?"
miamidolphins,ffgpqhc,t1_ffgkreo,1579911935.0,But if there's no good O linemen available at 26 then we can take an RB. It's bad to take an RB if you have one first rounder but we have 3.

USMC,ff5tmcc,t1_ff5m5vn,1579609781.0,"It can but for example the Stryker and Bradley are used for different purposes. The CV is more comparable to a Brad than a Stryker. Similar to Russia's mixed use of BTRs and BMPs. The CV can have double the armored protection the Stryker has. Stryker armor protects up to 14.5mm whereas the CV protects up to 30mm APFSDS. So the CV can take a BMP-2 head on while the Stryker cant. 

The Stryker is good if you want to drop the boys off and leave but the CV is a better option to stay and fight. I guess it depends on your doctrine."
