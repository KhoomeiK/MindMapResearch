AskReddit,ffq03bi,t3_eujx69,1580113166.0,"Back when I used to bite my arms as ""punishment"" for myself whenever I did something bad, I hung out with a group of disabled kids (most were middle schoolers or freshmen in high school). One day we went to a park nearby that also had a small beach, and we were sitting at a picnic table, eating snacks.

This girl sitting next to me notices my bitten arm and asks, loudly, ""What happened to your arm? Did a boy bite you?""

I felt my face go red in that moment. I uttered out a small ""um, uh, yeah, uh, a boy bit me there"" as a lie. Luckily no one really cared enough to listen at the time.

Buy those and keep them with you at *all times.* The way the alarm in particular works is that if you're being attacked, you can pull the chain out of the alarm, which causes a deafening beeping noise that usually scares off criminals and may attract the attention of some passerby.

And how am I supposed to know you're telling the truth? I usually remain skeptical about these things. I could say I got a diploma in animal care too, but that's not true.

>  I find it interesting that the only people who think it’s okay are people who have put their own cats through it. There is no need for cats to declawed. 

Yes, there is a need. You seem to miss the exception to my opinion: if they are outdoor cats, don't declaw them. If they are indoor, then sure, you are welcome to declaw at your own discretion. Don't stick your nose into other people's business.

> If you are worried about their claws you shouldn’t have one in the first place. 

That's an unhealthy, extremist opinion and I'm gonna kindly suggest you reconsider. There are plenty of things far worse than declawing a cat. I've seen cats washed in dryers, cooked in microwaves, kicked, beaten, abused. *All* of those things are *far* worse, and *that* is the stuff I have a problem with. People who do *that* stuff should not have cats. People who declaw their cats should not be subject to such a punishment as taking what could possibly be a support animal for them, official or non, away.

> Of course you will justify it if you have done it to your own animals. There is tons of research why declawing is bad and puts your cats at major risk. Cats having claws is natural for them and does not bring any health risks

There are people who have done so that regret it strongly; just look at this post's comments and you'll find one or two.

I had a cat, declawed, who lived until she was 17. You know what she died from? Kidney failure. And *that* was *not* caused by declawing. Another cat I had died from seizures, and that was *also* not caused by declawing. 

I only declaw them in the front, not the back; as such, my current cats can land perfectly fine and none of them have had balance issues. Likewise, my mother has owned over 20 cats over the course of her lifetime, and none of her cats have had any issues related to declawing. That isn't luck and it certainly isn't coincidence.

> Also the -15 downvotes seem to disagree with you saying you don’t need educating. And the only other person who has agreed with you is a child who has been messaging people to kill themselves.

Do you think I care about worthless Internet points? Downvotes are like pebbles thrown at me. Small, tiny pebbles that don't even cause me any pain. I'm firmly set in my ways. As long as my state allows declawing, we will continue to do so in the front claws only. I can just as easily go hunting for articles that prove my own point, but as they say, you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped. That includes you.

The ""child"" you speak of is messaging people with KYS threats because while he is correct in saying words hurt (in a response to me that was either removed or deleted), he doesn't realize this is Reddit, where you have to toughen up. Not everyone is nice here. Rest assured I'm not defending what he's doing; KYS threats aren't okay regardless.

> Declawing cats is selfish. You are cruel for having it done to your cats. Educate yourself on the risks you have put your beloved pet at. I’ve said all the facts about it and have seemed to ignore them all.

It's not selfish at all. I've read up on the proof, and I'm dead-set in my ways. I'm definitely not cruel, and the only time I would be is if I did the aforementioned things to a cat--cooking it, putting it in the dryer, etc. Luckily, I have, and never will, do that, and all of those things are *far* worse than a declawing. And fuck the people who do those things too, they can go to hell.

Pick your battles. You can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped. And with that I bid adieu."
iamatotalpieceofshit,ff221ys,t1_feyxsbh,1579491690.0,"That's not the same thing. A child--a human, I should be more vague--is different than a cat. We don't scratch on trees or use our nails in the same way a cat does. Our nails aren't as much of a necessity, either. We declaw ourselves, actually, by cutting toenails and fingernails. Think about that.

Indoor cats do not need their claws. For outdoor cats, by all means, don't declaw them. But for indoor cats, they don't need their claws because they do not need to hunt, climb trees, or do anything that nails are an essential survival tool for. The ""dEcLaWiNg BaD"" hivemind of Reddit is annoying, but it's definitely not as annoying as other hiveminds I've come across.

I'm not the one that needs to be educated here, bud-bud. My cats are fine, healthy, and declawed, unlike cats who *are* clawed who may face the opposite problems."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fewk6s1,t1_feveuuw,1579412405.0,"Just ignore them. It's the Reddit ""dEcLaWiNg BaD"" hivemind at it again. 

My cats, indoor cats, are declawed as well. They're perfectly fine, they're well-fed, healthy, and have barely caused any issues. The only time cats need claws is if they're outdoor cats, for hunting and surviving in the wild, a la instinct. Indoor cats don't need their claws because they survive on pet food, so there is no need to hunt, or climb trees, or do most anything claws can do outside.

My mother is a landlord, had to deal with a couple who had *far* more assholery than late rent (it's a long story).
