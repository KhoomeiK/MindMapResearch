bipolar2,fed52je,t1_fed2blb,1578999255.0,"I'm sorry for your loss. All of them.

This shit is hard. Every damn day.

You are not other people's actions and anyone's vision of you is not your truth.

That' being said, eat something healthy, read, and/or write. OR do none of those things because you're in charge. 

Either way, I believe in your survival because everything you're talking about shows me that you do want things to be better.

Help yourself in making things better :)"
bipolar,fed4pwo,t3_eohifr,1578998748.0,"In the past year, I've been opening up to my friends about how my brain works. It usually stems from an event though. I may not show up for something or not text back for days. In my experience, my friends have taken it personally which I correct and explain. The ones who really care about you will attempt to understand even if they can't.

It's ok to tell your friends to look out for you, even if it is just ""keep inviting me"". I like being remembered.

Some will never understand or will choose not to. That's a good way of knowing who your good friends (or family) really are too."
bipolar,fed3za5,t3_eocl2d,1578997664.0,"It's a funny thing to hold a job while you are either up or down. Your performance comes into question all the time (i.e., being late, no call/no show, general attitude) which becomes a real problem. I've had managers ask me straight out what the hell is going on because it's like im a different person from one day or week to another. I started to safely open up about how my brain works for them to have context.

Due to the ADA (if American) workplaces need to give you ""reasonable accommodation"" if you request it. Your manager doesn't even have to know what's going on if you have an HR department to deal with. I asked for a quiet and solo working space which I had to fight for. Many workplaces are different and there are different rules everywhere, but its something to look into.

Simply, if you ask and its ""reasonable"" it could make the job thing a little easier. If they say no, well, that's a whole other post. 

Context: I work at a bank"
bipolar,fed3ihg,t1_feafiwg,1578996983.0,"I'm at 300mg and its affecting my sleep as well. I'm supposed to take it as early as possible as I take Adderall as well (10mg). But if I can't sleep anyway...do I take it whenever? 

Seriously tho, what time are you taking it?"
AboveandBeyond,e2dj1m3,t3_8xcdwp,1531576558.0,I'm prepping to be there all day/all night. I intend to get home when the sun comes up!
