Dogtraining,fesio1w,t1_fes8fuv,1579365618.0,"I suggest starting with #3. I think your pup is past the point of #1 helping. I adopted a dog a little over a year who would get over aroused easily and start nipping, and ending our interaction and seperating myself from him for a few minutes taught him he got the opposite of what he wanted if he nipped. If you can sign him up for puppy classes and play dates, I also agree it may help to have him play with other pups, although he may be too much for them, and play needs to be monitored closely."

Tell him to make the arrangements he wants by himself through an attorney and you will do your best to honor them, and then do what you need to do for yourself. So if he has his head removed and a skull sent to you, put it in the attic with a note and forget about it. Yes, I'm basically telling you to lie. But, again, he's going to be dead, so you know. Oh well."
relationships,feseh60,t3_eqgltz,1579364365.0,"Instead of focusing on what he might be doing when you talK to him focus on this: 

""... ever since getting this job he has changed. Hes angry alot. Sometimes he goes outside when on the phone with coworkers and I can hear him yelling at whoever he is talking to. He seems bitter, and tired now. He snaps alot. He snaps at me sometimes which he has never, ever done. He never seems happy to see me, or relaxed at home. Hes always keyed up about something. I dont like it, and I dont like who he is right now. ""

this is what you need to talk about. Be supportive - ""hey you want to save money, and go back to college - that's great, but we need to find a way to do it that doesn't make you this angry, bitter, tired person, because that's not who I married, and I'm not fond of him"" Change your approach. Let go of not knowing what he is up to, he's protecting you. Just focus on making a change, and try to come up with some solutions that will help. He probably is not happy about what he is doing either and when you are accusatory, it just makes him feel worse."
sex,fedtrfj,t1_fed2h0s,1579019716.0,"never ask someone to compare you to a previous lover. Instead ask if there is something he likes that you can do for him (or her). That way, they can think about what they enjoy, not who they enjoyed."
sex,fedsqa2,t3_eol8vc,1579019086.0,"This is a difficult issue for both of you, and it's really important that you both learn to communicate well with each other and talk about things. First, she needs to see a GYN. There could be a physical issue, and if you keep trying without resolving that it will lead to mental blocks that make everything worse. So for the moment, take a step back from penis-in-vagina sex. Sit down and talk. Reassure her that you love her and don't want to cause her physical pain. Ask her to make an appointment, and ask her if she wants you to go with her, or if she'd rather go alone. Tell her you want to help her resolve the issue if you can. Make sex something she will enjoy - use a vibrator or whatever, but make sure she reaches orgasm, and find other ways for you to enjoy it while you figure out the root of the problem. You've help on this long, just be supportive, hold her hand, go to a sex therapist if you need to and try really hard not to let your frustration out on her, because believe me, she is also frustrated, sad and upset, and doesn't like disappointing you. She probably feels guilty for not being able to have sex, even though it's not her fault her body isn't cooperating.  She may need to do stretching exercises and other things. Offer to help, but don't be upset if she'd rather do it alone."

If you will be okay with your dog sleeping in bed with you as an adult, then by all means, let the puppy sleep with you. But if you won't want the full grown dog to sleep with you, don't start the habit now, as the puppy won't understand why on earth the rule changed. Consistency is key with dogs."

Dogtraining,fe2uuz3,t3_ennza0,1578843069.0,"First off google ""Littermate syndrome"" Raising two puppies simultaneously is more than twice as difficult than raising one.  And sometimes 2 dogs just do not get along, much like people. I'm sure you know someone who grew up hating their sibling. Plus, you have 2 females, which is the most likely gender combination to have aggression issues in a two dog home. Don't leave anything of value out while they are together so that there isn't anything to fight over, and don't leave them alone together. Honestly, I'd rehome 1 if you can."

reactivedogs,fdk3ggu,t3_elpqfc,1578495129.0,"depends. will you be living close enough to take your dog for frequent play dates with your Mom's dog? Can you consider adding a playmate when you do get a house? Maybe don't worry about it right now since it is so far off anyway. By the time you get to that point the answer may be more obvious. If not, you will find out when you move. Take him with you if he seems depressed or the reactivity returns, then you let him go back to your Mom."

sex,fdeoe9x,t3_ekx76l,1578343268.0,"I think it all comes down to individual preference. Different people see sex differently. Only you can decide if you are comfortable in a relationship with someone who clearly doesn't require a lot of commitment before enjoying a roll in the hay, so to speak. It's ok for you to not be ok with having that type of partner if it makes you uncomfortable in any way. It's ok for her to enjoy casual sex, too, but you can choose not to get involved as a result."
