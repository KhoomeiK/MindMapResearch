eagles,fgukbtn,t1_fgtzsuj,1581122949.0,I really want that too but I'm afraid if I post an episode 2 post people will think I'm spamming for karma lol when really I just like episode specific discussions
eagles,fgud2ci,t1_fgu0o3z,1581117862.0,"I was all in on ruggs but I don't know he catches with his body a lot, will likely have to trade up for, and has limited routes ran. I really want Jalen reagor in the 2nd. Better value, still extremely fast, and is stronger/goes up for contested catches."
eagles,fgucxuu,t1_fgu99kx,1581117780.0,Yea but being down your 4 starting cbs by week 4 did not help either...
eagles,fgu5dq3,t1_fgu153o,1581113588.0,It's so crazy I never thought he'd be with us longer then any other team he's been with.
eagles,fgttequ,t1_fgt9xk0,1581109035.0,I think you are looking into it a little much because outside info. I agree I don't trust alshon but nothing from episode 1 stood out to me
eagles,fgtt400,t1_fgsxfz7,1581108977.0,If anything it made it cuter. I respect the effort
eagles,fgtszsh,t1_fgsyqzj,1581108959.0,Woah woah woah this is an episode 1 discussion. I trust Amazon writers so I'm assuming we have a super happy ending winning it all like how it started w our super bowl win. No spoilers bro
eagles,fgtst97,t1_fgsz9ak,1581108903.0,And then he says it's for DeSean alshon and Nelson basically spelling DAN lmao
eagles,fgtsqg7,t1_fgt4sb5,1581108859.0,Goals!
eagles,fgtspxu,t1_fgt6eme,1581108852.0,Creates drama which then makes people complain/comment about it which then makes some morbidly curious so they watch just to see / confirm lol
eagles,fgts171,t1_fgto1ef,1581108553.0,Old so need a 2nd option just in case...
eagles,fgtrzd9,t1_fgtfjem,1581108522.0,Jalen is totally one of the reasons scandrick is so salty and it makes me love mills even more
PS4,fgsokgy,t1_fgsljcm,1581089279.0,I assume reddit compressed the image. At least it doesn't look 4k to me
eagles,fgsodk3,t1_fgrl2ze,1581089156.0,Because he creates drama which people then comment about which makes others watch out of morbid curiosity
eagles,fgsobnt,t1_fgrr2p6,1581089122.0,Dude that made him my favorite corner instantly. Dude couldn't feel his feet but playing was what was most important to him. Like that was so badass since he knew we were hurt at cb already.
eagles,fgso8i9,t1_fgsnanv,1581089065.0,Even watching alshon score early on was hard...
eagles,fgso72g,t1_fgsk2f8,1581089040.0,His daughter saying E A G L E S EAGLES is goals man
