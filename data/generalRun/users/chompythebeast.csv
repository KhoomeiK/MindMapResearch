todayilearned,ff7tsia,t1_ff7rg9j,1579658184.0,">So you CHOOSE to sacrifice innocent lives to offenders who escape.

Sort of an outrageous accusation to lead with. I prefer the path that I could best control: Kill no man I cannot be literally 100% certain deserves it, where life is not in jeopardy. It is useless to kill a man you've already beaten, tied up, and declawed, anyway.  But where life *is* in jeopardy, action must be taken, even killing, if it means the protection of the innocent. As for violent offenders, I am certainly *not* for their release while they remain dangerous. A failure that leads to the murder of another innocent by a man who should not have been let go is horrifying in the way that killing an innocent man is horrifying, but there is one extreme difference between these two failures: In one example, I have not made *myself* a murderer of the innocent. 

We must admit failures of this kind exist and do our best to minimize them, but it is better to be mistaken and *not* kill someone than it is to be mistaken and to kill someone. We cannot murder all the murderers away, we simply can't. We *can*, however, reasonably hope to remove the worst elements of society from our midst once they've shown themselves to be as such."
todayilearned,ff7paxl,t1_ff7oa0w,1579655051.0,"No man is innocent, you're right, but the idea that the law determines who is deserving of life, even when the law is so obviously capable of being wrong, disgusts me.

The blood on our hands isn't washed away with more blood. And ""compensating the estate of the victim"" is probably most clinical and gross defense of wrongful state murder anyone could conjure. ""Sorry we put you through hell for the last several years and eventually murdered your dad who was completely innocent, turning his existence into an absolute protracted nightmare before snuffing it out—would a cool mil make it all better?""

Imprison violent criminals. Never release anyone who would commit the deed again. Seek to repair the failed person who committed the violent acts in order to actually make redemption possible. 

But do not murder someone over something you cannot be 100% sure they did, and the courts don't operate under 100% tolerances, or even close.

If you catch someone committing a lethal act, by all means, do what must be done. But caging them for years before snuffing them out he way the system does is abhorrent and beneath our society.

Besides, it's a waste of money—people often mistakenly believe that it's cheaper to kill people than to incarcerate them, yet death row inmates cost orders of magnitude more yo the state than general population prisoners do.

I am not some sort of purist who denies that there is such a thing as a time to kill, nor do I hate the death penalty because I wring my wrists over the very idea of killing. But that time expires some years later, when a prisoner is already laid low and powerless. At that point it's pure savagery.

NintendoSwitch,ff7c5l6,t1_ff73coz,1579646107.0,"BOTW, Odyssey, and Mario Kary 8 Deluxe all have over 50% attachment rates (that's the number of console owners who also have those games) back in late 2018, so it seems true that most Switch owners do have those games.

Meanwhile, I'm not immediately seeing data on Ultimate's attachment rate, but Smash for the Wii U had somewhere around 40%, and Smash Wii had 13%. These numbers are of course affected by the amount of consoles the Wii and Wii U sold (many more Wii sales made a higher attachment rate that much less likely). Yet it is *also* being reported that the Switch has much higher relative attachment rates than the Wii did, especially amongst first party games.

**Edit:** Ahh, and as I post this, I just found the smoking gun: Nintendo's sales figures, accurate up to Sept 30 of last year, for both [hardware](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/) and [software](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html). Going by those numbers, *no game* now has 50% attachment, thanks to huge Switch sales. The Top 4 are:

**1.** Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (46%)

**2.** Smash Bros. Ultimate (38%)

**3.** Super Mario Odyssey (37%)

**4.** The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (35%)

**Bonus 5.** Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!/Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! (28%)

Again, this is from the end of September, so these numbers have definitely changed some. It's unlikely any of this list would be re-ranked, but the new Pokémon games stand some chance of usurping the Let's Go games before too long.

Anyway, Smash is the second biggest game on the Switch, beaten only by a launch-window title that had a 589 day head start on it (and beating #3 by a whole percent despite being released 407 days after it), and well over one in three Switch owners has it."

In some ways, honestly, it deepens a sense of disgust and dread in the reader—there's an argument that's been made that his obvious contempt for humanity sort of harmonizes with the themes and feelings he's trying to evoke in his literature. We are often meant to be repulsed by his words, and it's fairly easy to ascribe the bitter language being used to Lovecraft's regularly unreliable narrators. But of course, the man really *did* harbor those thoughts—he wasn't just mimicking them for the page. So even meta-readings of his work should still fall short of *apologizing* for the way he thought. 

Lovecraft is a fairly interesting figure in the whole ""separating the art from the artist"" conundrum, really."

Games,ff6v54p,t1_ff6uslm,1579635524.0,"He has some pretty questionable descriptions of deranged cultists in swamps and stuff which are often charged with racial language. I can't remember a line outright stating racist ideology, but there is a pervasive sense of ""less-than"" that he uses to describe a lot of characters that we don't tend to ""see"" very often, but who are usually only described.

I haven't read his entire body of work, but even reading the popular stuff, I definitely got some uncomfortable (and not in the good way) vibes from some of his descriptions of people"

Still that's a lot of cash even in GTAO"
reddeadmysteries,ff6tt7v,t3_erz4u8,1579634738.0,">Btw...Did you know that the Reutlinger watch is in GTAO? It’s just called the rare pocket watch, and it’s worth $150,000!!!

150... Wow, has anyone ever gotten it? How do we know it exists? Data mining? That's a king's damn ransom, that is! 

Personally I subscribe to the theory that Rockstar puts lots of interesting tweaks like this in their games just to make the world seem deeper—the vast majority of the time, there is no further discovery to be made, but the very fact that you believed there was one was the entire point of the flourish by the devs. I don't think that's being cheap or misleading, I think it's the same thing as a throwaway line in a fantasy novel that has you going ""Wait... What?? I wanna see *that!*"", when that reaction was the entire goal of the author, nothing more. Call it ""world building"", maybe, but if you were being less generous, you could say that Rockstar deliberately fills its games with red herrings and Chekhov's guns that never fire. 

This one is pretty egregious, of course—how could anyone *not* be intrigued by a clock replacing one of its numbers with the spicy triskaideka? Why 8 and not 12, or any other number? I am skeptical that there is anything in the game that you can *do* with this mystery, but it's fun to contemplate, and again, I think that's usually the extent of Rockstar's goal with these sort of things.

But seriously, what's the story with that insanely priced watch Online? Is is obtainable? Are there other wildly priced artifacts like that?"

FragileWhiteRedditor,ff6o87s,t1_ff6ktux,1579631404.0,"His post title is accurate. It's a technique he's using to lure you in with reasonable ideas, then he ramps up the rhetoric in the body of the post.

Did you read the post? ""racism isn't a big deal nowadays""? You find that *agreeable*? Because dude is 100% speaking from privilege to say that nobody is ever deprived anything at all because of their race in 2020, that's just patently and obviously untrue.

So yeah, his title is completely correct. But his post (ie his conclusions based upon that first idea) are complete bullshit.

Furthermore, as the top comment here points out, this same asshole has a post like this in his history:

>Another post from that same OP - “We should call black females N**gettes”.

This is of course some major bullshit, MLK wouldn't have been as successful as he was without the Black Panthers carrying rifles around capital buildings and making white folks shit their pants.

The NRA supported gun control laws in the 60s beause of Malcom X. That's how terrified white America was of him"
