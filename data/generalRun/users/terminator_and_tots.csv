If they choose to pay out for deaths rather than recall an item, the corporation is executed. Deliberate murder incurs the death penalty. The CEO and everyone who knew are banned from holding similar positions for life, and the business itself is sold for parts."

We need to talk about incomptency in order to eradicate it. Our lives are not worth the silence to ""protect"" those who don't always make good decisions. This is how we lose our ability to make our own decisions - by enforcing blind obedience to anyone with any kind of doctorate. 

Research, ask questions, and ALWAYS get a second opinion. 

And don't be afraid to fire your doctor. Some of them (more than you'd think) are absolute idiots."

BookbindingResource,fc4ckt6,t3_efxpvr,1577412759.0,"If you're still learning (and seriously, don't wait as long as I did to make sure the long grain runs along the spine), try Goodwill! 

Okay, you said ""quality"". Sorry. I'm on book 15 and only just now thinking I've learned enough for quality paper!"
BookbindingResource,fc4c4wr,t3_eg18g4,1577412399.0,"I did! And I made so many books and learned so many things!

And then I moved up to chipboard, and oh, that was fun!

And then I started gluing my chipboard crossways, which was a delight, and made a wondrously thick cover -

Until wheat paste and I got into a fight, and then I met PVA. (We're now inseparable.)

And then I finally bought real bookboard. I hoarded it for MONTHS until the right project came along, and oh -

Oh. Oh my. The texture, the strength, the feel in my hands - you don't know. You won't know until you're finally ready to finally admit your utter obsession with paper and leather and bindings and glue and bone folders and the feel of it all in your hands - in bits and pieces or a finished book, though perhaps it doesn't matter, because the pieces mean a book is being made, and a finished book means a new one is about to begin -

Welcome. Enjoy your new addiction!"
