I also would like to know what conditions led to her son even wanting this shirt.  It could be a consequence of piss-poor parenting, but some people are just stupid despite competent parenting (I speak from experience, as my parents were quite competent and I am an idiot)."

I have gained some strength and muscle mass but I would never be confused for a bodybuilder nor even a professional athlete, nor have I ever expected such an outcome.  This despite being on the ""edge of failure"" or even at total failure.  I would even say that I have been a failure for years before getting into weightlifting.
