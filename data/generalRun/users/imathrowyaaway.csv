wholesomememes,ffakx7m,t1_ffa8jli,1579738328.0,"same! started 3 years back and my life has turned around. I used to suffer from GAD, insomnia, obsessive thoughts... but talking to myself nicely, treating myself with love and respect, plus some other mental health exercises/practices have changed my life. 

I barely remember what it was like to be depressed atm. my whole “aura” (or whatever you wanna call it) has changed - people don’t even wanna believe that it’s me when I show them pictures from a few years back."
FreeCompliments,ffahxyx,t3_esh3ky,1579736153.0,"I’m not exaggerating: based on the pic, had you put that you are 20 and haven’t had kids yet, I would not have questioned it! you look stunning!

I don’t know what postpartum depression is like but I do know depression...

over anything else, please don’t put pressure on yourself for feeling low, and give yourself all the love that you can.

it’s hard to keep this in mind when the night is darkest but the sun WILL rise again, and better days are ahead!

you will make it through this and days will come, when the memory of these hardships will seem hazy and no longer even of great importance. 

take care :)"

GlobalOffensive,femxn6r,t1_femw13o,1579272269.0,"the awp situation is definitely interesting. even MSL had an MVP as the primary awp. 

I think awpers are still in demand but it has to be those standout, aggresive playmaker awpers like s1mple, cerq, or woxic. dev1ce being the one passive exception but he’s a freak and used to rifle primarily before, so a hybrid basically."
GlobalOffensive,fempgut,t1_femjjmc,1579265689.0,"F3 was a pretty weird project overall. I mean, they barely played games, somehow almost always qualified for the major, brought up some talented players, and gave veterans a place to finish their careers. 

I don't think any conventional logic applies to them. still, gotta respect what they accomplished with what little they had."

WatchPeopleDieInside,fe53c8b,t1_fe4yzef,1578865293.0,"thanks! I was aware that this would be the reaction I would likely get, I‘m OK with it. 

many of us know that contraceptives can fail, some women’s bodies tolerate birth control poorly, a condom is only 98% effective, a condom can have a barely noticeable break, it is possible to get pregnant from precum in a tiny number of cases, etc. 

but some people just LOVE to assume, hate and/or lecture. it is what it is."

I was in 2 LTRs, both with women who were victims of rape. I know that the way you feel isn‘t something that my words can take away just like that. Still, I would like you to know that in my eyes, I never saw them as anything lesser. On the contrary, I started admiring them for their strength to move forward, to learn to trust again, and even to build an intimate relationship, in time. 

I‘m glad you reached out for help and for encouragement now. You are beautiful and strong."

AskMen,fdqi5lb,t3_emrdbd,1578667262.0,"everything is in motion, we change over the course of our lives. we fall, we grow, we gain new perspectives, and we always keep on learning about ourselves. first of all, allow yourself to feel what you feel, appreciate it, observe it, and don't judge it.

as for the change... how much have you changed already that you went from an abusive home, to never wanting kids, to even feeling the first glimpses of a desire to have a family of your own, perhaps?

you already know that we don't grow, or change at once. it comes in steps. mostly it happens when there is a need or stimuli. over everything else, trust yourself that you are not a copy of your parents. you are better. you don't need to be perfect. you'll fail. you'll succeed. but you've grow this far, you always found a way, why would it be any different when it comes to having a family?

for me specifically, it was important to avoid contact with my biological family and to always try to find real ""solutions"" to my feelings and to deal with them with a lot of love towards myself."

todayilearned,fdgp58n,t1_fdgimjx,1578404579.0,"the tone is different to me, personally. the german tone is more informal and joking than the English translation. so I can see how the redditor I replied to could have misunderstood the context."
todayilearned,fdgffir,t1_fdg0355,1578394313.0,"I read the original in German, the translation really doesn't convey his message at all. the poems is written in a lighthearted tone and even slightly pokes fun at the bird and in the end, Mozart sarcastically writes about himself being able to ""rhyme so nicely"". that's it, the tone above was added by the translator."
GlobalOffensive,fdf7i9u,t1_fdemxu4,1578355101.0,"this was exactly my experience. only I was also told to just quit CS, how awful I am, and other stuff by toxic teammates. 

my hands were shaking for my first 20 games or so, because I was super scared of being told how awful I am again if I fail.

I started playing CS at the lowest point in my life, had to start taking antidepressants back then because I had thoughts of hurting myself, since my life was in shambles. 

I have forgiven those toxic teammates but people really should think twice before they say hurtful things. you never know what playing CS might mean to somebody and what they might be going through."

OldSchoolCool,fdemrpo,t1_fde8cwz,1578342310.0,"My best friend and his brother are like this. Both ripped, had six-packs since they were like 18, incredibly resilient when it came to injuries and recovering with ease.

Yet, they never had a workout routine, all they did was sports on a casual, amateur level. My best friend didn't even know how to properly use gym equipment until he was almost 30. For their whole 20s, they rarely cared about getting lots of sleep, or what proteins even are, or what they should eat in general. 

Their parents are both athletic though and great at sports. Maybe genetic, I suppose."

BedBros,fciv0ls,t3_eheewc,1577670473.0,"above everything else, stay calm and don’t sweat it. sleeping when you’re ill is okay. screwing up your sleep schedule while you’re sick is okay as well. 

the deed is done now, not much you can do. so just lie down and enjoy knowing that things will sort themselves out and that you can relax for the remaining hours, instead of stressing out. 

also, people with insomnia (like myself) can get by on 2-3h of sleep at times, multiple days in a row. it’s not a death sentence, just not very good long-term. 

cut yourself some slack and buy some melatonin and some natural herbal supplements to calm down, if it becomes too much of an issue. 

good night."
