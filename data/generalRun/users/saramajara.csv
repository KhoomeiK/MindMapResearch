Legit dosing off while sitting up, texting, ect. So tired but can’t sleep for more than a few minutes at a time at night, my neck and shoulders are killing me and it feels like I have a really bad deep bruise on the right side of my chest under my clavicle. Migraines and dizzy spells.

amiugly,ffl3qmf,t3_eu0mvr,1580034259.0,"OP you are NOT fat, and you KNOW the flaws you see in the mirror are not real. Asking for the opinion of a bunch of strangers is going to kill your self esteem, BDD or not. I refuse to post my picture here for ratings despite earning my living off of my appearance, and knowing I’m pretty. I don’t need some troll telling me my jawline is poor and not as defined as a Kylie Jenner and risk knocking the self esteem I’ve cultivated. Neither do you. It must be really hard to not be able to trust a mirror, but I would trust most of these negative remarks even less. 

100% - you are not ugly. You have nothing to worry about. There is not a single feature of yours that stands out as different, strange, or warrants extra negative attention.. you’re handsome guy. Period. The only thing that would make you more attractive would be confidence."

OP has deleted this post, and I find argument lacks any constructive outcome. Our conversations are an utter waste of my time. Although I do find humor in your “know it all” approach to everything and in your vague handpicked statistics, and especially the way you rationalized reversing nearly 20% of the data you chose to cite! Ultimately I find banging my head against a brick wall to be much more pleasant.

depression,ffbkryc,t1_ffbid70,1579770067.0,"I didn’t downvote you, but I flat out disagree.

Depression is thought to be cause by a combination of several of the following: faulty mood regulation by the brain, genetic vulnerability, stressful life events, medications, medical problems, chemical imbalances, and probably a lot more. 

I do not, and will never believe curing mental illness as simple as willing yourself to change your outlook on life. Sure, maybe changing your whole life could do it, but not just your outlook.

Joy is found everywhere. It’s a normal human emotional. People in prison sometimes find serenity and joy, the poorest people in the world find moments of happiness. Humans can find love during a tragedy. Money just has no place in dictating who suffers from depression. 

Depression is an illness. People with money in their pocket, just have better access to treatment of that illness. They have access to better doctors, better therapy, and better medication without having to give up their standard of life, and without the added stress of juggling bills or working longer hours to pay for it. And I’m not talking about just the 1%, I’m talking about the upper-middle class on upwards. People with savings, good insurance, people with padding. 

I would have to spend $20 more than I make in a week, for a 1 hr session with my therapist of choice."
depression,ffbj50x,t1_ffbcbv5,1579767732.0,"Because seeing a therapist or psychologist weekly for few years while you have the privilege to do so, can teach you super valuable and healthy coping skills for when you’re on your own. 

And because you don’t know you even needs meds. A physiatrist working in concert with your therapist may Rx an SSRI for a few months or years, and likely you’ll feel well enough to not need it anymore.

People don’t get Rxed antidepressants for the rest of their lives! I mean, some do.. but if you’ve yet to even try how can you know.

I would Kill for the opportunity to see a good therapist, even just for a few months. I would freaking claw for the opportunity you’re throwing away."

I sat on the phone with Medicaid for hours while they called every psychiatrist on their list within 25 miles. I live in a major city. And exactly 0 doctors were alive, taking new patients, and had an appt available within 6 months. 

I now see a psych. that charges me a reduced fee for my bi-monthly visits, but does not have an assistant, computer, or telephone."

depression,ffbh2ik,t1_ffb7sar,1579764973.0,"It sounds like you have “depressed” about being poor, and a depressed poor person confused. 

I have been a wealthy depressed person and a poor depressed person. Both suck. But I have to say I got much more out of my therapy with Dr. Adhrita Par on my BCBS ppo, than 20 year old Courtney the “so you feel like..” parrot who’s a credit or 2 shy of her associates and takes Medicaid.

There IS something to be said for practicing gratitude, Although I think it’s easier after you’ve been through a worse level of hell. I still have to walk out of the grocery store with my items unpaid if I want to eat, but I get to lay in a bed on a mattress under a roof every night. With 10 pillows. And I consciously enjoy it every single night. I think the only reason I’m able to feel that gratitude is because for a long time those were thing I didn’t have.

Everyone’s bottom is the worst they have ever known. It is respectively, the worse hell. It’s really hard to be grateful for things you’ve always had. And NO ONE has EVER felt better by being told other people have it worse.

The advice I’ve found helpful is, “just hang on - it can only get better. And if it doesn’t - you’ll only be standing where you are right now”"

For your butterfly where you talk about your ankle.. are you meaning it was meant to be an extended butterfly? If you’re tired I don’t think there’s anything wrong with hooking your knee, just really try to straighten your arms and push your chest away from the pole.

ptsd,ff75wtr,t1_ff6vim6,1579641755.0,"If you do decide you want to strip, just be aware it’s a whole separate entity than pole dance. I’d definitely go to a few clubs you’d be interested in working at on a fri/sat night and watch the girls on stage, interacting with patrons, and giving lap dances (if you can). See what the level of touch is like if you’re comfortable with it. Also consider guying a gal a drink and see what she has to say about working there.

FYI lap dances are super hard on your quads and glutes, and you’ve gotta be able to throw on some unique shit. Also, starts working on your splits (both fronts and middle) now."

Coincidentally I am trying to sell my pole at the moment. It’s a competition standard, static / spin, pressure mounted X-Pole bought in 2016/2017 with carrying case. I never really got in the habit of using it at home, so it’s very lightly used - if you are anyone else are interested in buying it, please DM me.

It’s great to hear someone else found pole as healing as I did"
ptsd,ff6n008,t3_erxkee,1579630661.0,"Yep. 

I was gang raped when I was 14. (My first sexual experience) I grew up to be pretty attractive, and would literally pick a guy ( usually a threatening one) and decide to get him date me. This was really unhealthy behavior, but I understand what you’re talking about. 

When I started stripping it gave me back this immense about of confidence, the ability to set firm boundaries, and any anger I was holding onto was just gone. I got to use my body, by my rules, to get those same faceless bros, that raped and humiliated me, to throw money at me. The best way I describe my first time on stage, is that it felt like stealing with my boobs.

One time during a private $300 dance this man slapped my ass maybe 5 minutes in. I had already told him that was absolutely unacceptable when he asked previously. I ended his dance and security escorted him out of the club. I kept my $300 dollars.

Don’t get me wrong, I have absolutely no ill feeling towards strip club patrons or my clients. I love them! They look at me like a goddess, and pay for my company as well as my dances.

That was EXACTLY what I needed to overcome my trauma. Although I will say, stripping is definitely not for everyone. I would guess that it’s pretty rare to find a victim of sexual abuse or assault that finds stripping cathartic. It’s competitive, physically hard work, and emotionally draining and sometimes it’s slow and the money sucks. Not to mention you need to feel 100% morally good about what you’re doing and have healthy self-esteem... people can be really cruel. But for me, the second I put on those 7” heels I feel like I own the world.

I also found the sport of pole dance incredibly healing, and got in the best shape of my life. Classes take place in a safe space with other women. Pole dance alone made me feel so strong and whole. I would and do recommend pole classes to everyone."
