Who goes to a doctor for help and thinks they know better than the trained, certified professional? If you know so much better, why go there in the first place? If your doctor says you need to take your shirt of for a mammogram, it means you need to take your shirt of for the mammogram. Because mammos work with x-ray and guess what? Having something over the surface you're trying to xray can result in a wrong result, even if it's thin clothing and when you try and diagnose cancer, that's a deadly mistake.

That's also the reason why hospitals usually try to get the are they xray undressed, I.e. if you come in with a broken arm they want you to take of your hoodie for a more accurate reading. And taking an xray of your chest to try to see ""weird"" spots that could be cancerous is a lot more delicate than checking if your bone is broken or not.

This is what I found out with a quick 5 minute research. All these HAES claim to have done their research and don't know shit about the procedure they're doing."

The risk you run with both of these is not giving your child the proper nutrition they need to grow and live.

What makes this so dangerous is that these are also the types of parents who either don't go to the doctor if their kid is sick or don't take the doctors advice. On one hand you have the extreme vegans who think that veganism is a cure all, that their cats / dogs should be vegan as well and are the type of mother who believes that the fact that they gave birth to this child means that they could evaluate their health better then any doctor could.
