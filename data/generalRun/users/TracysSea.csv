aww,ff5ku3j,t3_ermxtz,1579597719.0,My dog watched your video and loved it. I played it half a dozen times for her. :)
CPTSD,ff2unp1,t3_er9s24,1579524847.0,"LOL. I turn 60 this year, and no, not so much. I am very appreciative of learning so much here and understanding what has been wrong with me and my family all these years. Without that understanding, I do not believe emotional peace would even be possible for me. I owe you people a lot!

I do not have the pressure to socialize the way young people do. I feel bad for you young folk because that pressure, internal and external, really sucks! My finances are tenuous but I'm OK today. To be brutally honest, I pretty much see human extinction coming in a decade, so that also changed what matters to me now. Stuff is what ends humanity, so materialism kinda died in me, and I know that later is a lie. In my better moments, I see myself as my own hero for realizing all that stuff. 

That means that the opportunity is now. I am not trying to catch up because I am the only one in the race. But I am not waiting for happiness anymore. If happy happens, even for a moment, I have a little party in my head and make it memorable. Having a happy dog gives me many such moments. :)

I dunno. In American terms, I am a complete loser in life, no career, no retirement, no prospects, estranged from my ex and kids, etc. But I know my story, and this is my happy ending. :)"
CPTSD,ff2qb1u,t3_er66bo,1579519141.0,"""Stop being a victim,"" is a thing victimizers say. Was someone here in this group talking like that? 

To say ""thank you sir"" for harm done is pure lunacy, IMO, but there are a lot of bat-shit crazy people in the world. There are a lot of people who get off on harming others too. They are low-lifes and idiots. :(

You are not too weak for life. You made it through everything that got you here. Stick with us here, on this group. You are gonna be OK. Hugs if you want them."

CPTSD,fexss0a,t3_equc8n,1579435560.0,"I have been pretty shocked by law enforcement over the last few years. Maybe I was floating in the ether before that, but it seems to me that it has gotten dark. From the officer's POV, that child is likely to wind up in foster care. He probably knows better than most what the foster care system where you live is like. He may actually have been right to be concerned that the child would be in more danger in the system. That is sad and dark. 

But child abuse is damn near impossible to talk about because people are impossible!

I worked for an attorney, who was formerly a magistrate (who had heard hundreds of domestic cases) and married to the DA. One of her small daughters dislocated her arm, and the doctors were all over my attorney, talking to social services, etc. She was livid and said, ""If they only knew who I am . . . "" BUT THAT IS WHAT SHE SHOULD WANT -Every parent is suspect if injury is apparent. Of all people, she should have been applauding! But she was all ego. 

When I worked child abuse prevention, our organization name was flowery, ""Building Families."" We had news coverage of our Mommy & Me class, and the participants were livid that they appeared in a feature that mentioned the words ""child abuse prevention,"" which was my agency's sole mission!

And then there's the whole political angle, so money and power enter the societal ugliness. Fuck the GOP and religion and any horseshit that suggests traumatizing a child is a good idea. 

How can we begin to solve a problem that we cannot even reasonably discuss as a society?"

My point was that you can have a whole lot of good things in childhood, but trauma is trauma. We tend to argue our own suffering as ""not that bad"" or ""not enough to make me like this."" There is a fuzzy idea that good stuff can negate bad stuff. Good stuff is good, but bad is still bad, and trauma is trauma. 

I absolutely agree on American exceptionalism, but it was kinda cool as a kid to feel part of superheroes. The badness of the US hit me like freight train, and there are a lot of Americans who still need to be tied to the tracks."

CPTSD,fe80aay,t3_eo1zsr,1578921000.0,"The most common symptom of CPTSD is denial that it could have been bad. ""It must be me that is organically screwed up because it could not have been THAT bad."" I used to go to AA and they had a saying there, ""No one walks into the rooms by mistake. If you are here, you have a drinking problem."" It's not circular reasoning. It's an accurate depiction of reality.

Self-compassion is strangely difficult for us. What seems like the simplest, happiest thing we could do, have compassion for self, requires rewiring our brains. In that sense, we are our own worst enemies. Whatever you went through was sufficient to get you here in this group, so you belong here. And don't let your bitch of an inner critic tell you otherwise!

I believe that you have CPTSD, but you do not need anyone else's judgment to conclude that.  You, of everyone on Earth, are the most qualified to make that call. Hugs to you. :)"

According to the pic, it makes you a racist. The post certainly argued that lack of faith is a BAD thing. Perhaps their problem is that they cannot find a way to promote faith without in some way denigrating the lack of it. I am very glad that is their problem and not mine.
