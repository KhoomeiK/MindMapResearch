AskGaybrosOver30,fgk31s5,t3_exkjy7,1580856448.0,"My 20s were a turbulent time. I will say since then, while life’s not perfect, I have gained a some zen about my life.  I generally am more confident, more at peace, more secure in my self image and my personal definition of success than I was in my 20s. My 20s were about worrying how my life would turn out.  I’m 40 now, and enjoy the day to day without worrying quite so much as I used to."
AskGaybrosOver30,fgk2ir7,t3_exqzuy,1580856143.0,"You do such great storytelling and writing, this was a great read thank you. 

I’m an atheist so I don’t personally experience these sorts of quandaries but I like to hear others perspectives on it,  it’s an interesting sort of self reflection and  philosophical struggle I don’t have access to. I hope you find the answers you’re looking for or at least enjoy the quest."
AntifascistsofReddit,fgjhpog,t3_eyanlz,1580844280.0,Thanks for posting this. I’ve always found the story of the white rose so inspiring. The courage of these people in the face of what was happening.  Always makes me want to do more.
askgaybros,fgjh0tl,t3_eyrhud,1580843869.0,"I say go for it. I dated a bi guy and it was a great experience for me.  I had all the bigoted concerns going into it- he’ll want a woman eventually, it’s just a phase for him, blah blah blah.  None of that happened. We weren’t suited to a long term thing, but had nothing to do with him being bi.  And I learned a lot about myself and what I enjoy sexually as a result of dating him."
askgaybros,fgjglry,t3_eyqvjb,1580843619.0,"40 year old prior Grindr user here. I didn’t find Grindr to be an amazing experience, it was alright. Definitely not a place I’d want to bring great expectations to.  Just be yourself and open to things and see what happens.  You’re definitely not ancient my dude."
AskGaybrosOver30,fgjg6c5,t3_exqhqk,1580843362.0,Since I’ve been bottoming I have gotten slightly bigoted “joking” comments from a few friends.  Nothing blatantly hateful but the bottom shaming sentiment’s there.  It’s shitty but don’t let it get you down. And don’t accept that type of behavior either you don’t deserve it.
AskGaybrosOver30,fgjfowy,t3_eydzv6,1580843065.0,"I am pretty good friends with an ex. Some time had to go by between the breakup and a friendship to emerge, definitely.  I had to fully break up with him, accept the reasons why we weren’t good as boyfriends.  But after some time and both of us moving on we kept up the communication and doing things together that we like doing. He’s a good bud now."
askgaybros,fgjdwnq,t1_fgjd4dt,1580842006.0,"Oh, sure well it started off with meeting a guy who happened to be a top.  I decided to try bottoming. I found myself attracted to him in that specific way, which was new for me.  We dated for a bit, then it ended. I went on to date, hook up with others and because of that experience, decided I wanted to continue bottoming, because of how much I enjoyed it.  

No idea if one day I’ll wake up and decide to want to top my current boyfriend, who knows.  I do know I’m getting what I need sexually for now."
askgaybros,fgjcrim,t1_fgjc79y,1580841327.0,"That’s interesting. I don’t feel like my gender had something to do with it, I don’t feel like I’ve taken on a new gender role or anything like that. 

I didn’t specifically ignore versatility, I just happened to meet a guy I found very attractive, and he happened to be a top. I decided to try bottoming and felt comfortable doing it with him specifically. I ended up enjoying it very much.  I’m sure if I had wanted versatility I’d have asked for it and then gone from there."
askgaybros,fgiviij,t3_eym9ii,1580831815.0,"Nice ted talk. I was a top for the majority of my life and never had a problem finding bottoms. This notion of a “top shortage” didn’t really register with me. 

Started bottoming about a year ago, didn’t experience any shortage of tops.  It was definitely a different experience, dating as a bottom and dating tops. I will say it was a bit different... crowd? Of guys being exclusive tops.  But I never felt like there was only one top around town and his calendar was full."

askgaybros,fghv986,t3_eyaz0l,1580794888.0,Don’t feel ashamed. I love riding my dildo and getting fucked by my boyfriend. Nothing wrong with it at all!
askgaybros,fghv580,t3_eyk676,1580794792.0,"He has a higher need for communication maybe, or feels a little insecure about things. My boyfriend doesn’t give me the cold shoulder but he does get annoyed with me if I don’t text him back within an hour or two of him texting me. Just talk to him and work out a consistent communication flow you can both live with."
askgaybros,fghuoz8,t3_ey920h,1580794403.0,"Play it safe. You are very young. I’m 40 and I immediately would suspect predatory creepy behavior from anyone my age lurking for 18 year olds on apps.  Not everyone of course,  but those are certainly out there. Be aware of your surroundings and what’s going on, don’t let yourself be put in a situation you aren’t comfortable in."

askgaybros,fgfibu9,t3_ey42pd,1580739539.0,I wasn’t horny yesterday but my boyfriend was. I gave him a nice lubed up handy on the couch while we watched tv. You just learn to make compromises in a relationship.

Might have been less confusing if I’d known what gay was and wasn’t made to feel like something was wrong with me as a kid."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fg2q8cn,t3_ewcdvs,1580451643.0,He’s unironically doing the “white mans burden” bit in real time. Amazing.
FragileWhiteRedditor,fg2pk1h,t3_ewbun7,1580450946.0,I guess I’m an outlier? I’m a white dude and I have yet for a Democrat to demand a personal apology from me for slavery that happened in the 17th century.

askgaybros,fg2n5vo,t3_ew20mc,1580448695.0,In what way specifically have you been described as rude? Do you curse a lot? Are you very candid or curt or boorish in your speech? Interrupt others? Talk with your mouth full? Look at your phone while you’re at dinner? Use the oyster fork instead of the salad fork? I need specifics.
