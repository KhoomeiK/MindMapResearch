painting,ferrw9o,t1_ferqvw7,1579357652.0,Practice makes better!!! These minis are much better for my patience (I’m an impatient person) because I get them done quicker than larger paintings and therefore I can create more pieces.

painting,fei8tfl,t3_eowbk1,1579132845.0,"I noticed a Wisdom of Balance and A Second Chance on this subreddit. When I saw Wisdom of Balance I loved it! I saw A Second Chance and I thought, “hmmm I wonder if that’s the same artist from before” and it was!! And then I saw this and thought the same thing so I just had to comment that your paintings are very beautiful and your techniques make your works very unified and recognizable!! Keep it up I love your paintings. Might I say I’m...blown away"

dogpictures,fdlm8p1,t1_fdllx53,1578527205.0,"Shiba inu was DEFINITELY on my radar cause of her tail, fur, size, coloring, and some aspects of her face. I’ll never know for sure unless we get a DNA test but I’m glad someone else supports my shiba claim!"
dogpictures,fdliwph,t1_fdlhvat,1578525016.0,"I wanna say 8ish months! She’s pretty small, around 40 pounds. Height...Like a bit taller than the height of the part you sit on a chair?? He mother I believe is some type of beagle mix but I’m not sure about anything else! 

Her personality is kind of...stuck up? Very sweet dog but she carries herself like a princess and loves to beg for food."
dogpictures,fdliehx,t1_fdlgzzx,1578524694.0,"For more personality info on Peanut, she’s very protective of our family and our smaller dog Buttercup. But with the family she’s very submissive (especially with me and my father) and affectionate. She follows my mother around like...a lost puppy. 

She likes to pick play-fights with the smaller dog by bringing a toy/stick/object over to her and instigating mischief. Her favorite game is “soccer” where we kick the ball, she chases after it, and then carries it around while we chase her for it and/or throw her another one to confuse her."
dogpictures,fdli0pj,t1_fdlgzzx,1578524452.0,"Here’s a link with a better view of her face! The face is what makes me think Dane but I’m not expert. She DOES punch and paw a bit but I’m not sure if that’s cause I taught her “paw” for treats and now it’s her go-to for treats and attention lol!

If you wanna guess more dog ingredients take a look at my other mystery rescue!! I believe the mother of this one is lab/beagle but I’m curious what else is in the mix.

dogpictures,fdlgzxi,t1_fdlgxl1,1578523821.0,Thank you! We agree
blop,fdlcs6r,t1_fdl9opg,1578521259.0,Omg! Just looked up that dog and it’s Soosoooooo pretty. I have a picture of her mother who kinda looks like she may be a lab/beagle mix. She has a bunch of siblings but they all look different and the rescuer said that it’s possible for there to be different dads??? I want to post another photo of her with her body to see what other people may think. She’s got a curly fluffy tail!!
dogpictures,fdlchcy,t1_fdivkyb,1578521077.0,"My thoughts have been shepherd mixed with either boxer or Great Dane but honestly I have no clue. Good idea about looking at videos of Great Danes. I feel like there are similarities. I like to compare Peanut (that’s her name) to a mountain lion the way she walks and runs. 

Red fox Labrador is very pretty but I’m not sure!!"
dogpictures,fdlc9c9,t1_fdim4ei,1578520943.0,I definitely agree shepherd mixed with something.
dogpictures,fdlc88l,t1_fdinzs5,1578520924.0,True that! I think my mother is interested in getting a DNA test for both our pups! Every day we wonder what they are!!

painting,fdet7id,t1_fddi02a,1578346101.0,Not sure if it’s the same thing but I do something similar by upping the saturation on the reference! It’s a good strategy for seeing color
painting,fdel6sq,t3_ekz2de,1578341371.0,Omg!!! Nooo she’s a cutie! And your painting definitely captures a gentle sweetness.
painting,fde5c56,t3_ekx4y7,1578331520.0,Recently posted one of these and people asked where I got the mini canvases and the answer is Walmart!! They have lots of different kinds from mini stretched canvases to mini canvas board and both types you can also buy with a magnetic backing. I’ve also seen them at Michael’s and I’m sure you can find them online.
