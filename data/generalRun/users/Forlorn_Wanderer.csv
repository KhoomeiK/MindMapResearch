AskReddit,fecz84i,t3_eoemhc,1578990811.0,"Is a guy with a an abnormally large penis morally obligated to their potential sex partner? Well no, and I will tell you why; First, it's hard to define a ""potential"" sex partner, secondo, just because someone has a micropenis does not mean they would suck (no puns intended) in bed.

And come on, gotta let a brother try and get his dick wet, even if it's of the 'micro' variety.

Oh, and as a lot of ladies said and will say; size actually doesn't matter, it's how you use it."

Besides, Molten-wow's cata back then was a mess before 4.3"

FoodPorn,fcmtpj5,t3_ehx1z1,1577791788.0,"So I made this last Thursday, second time making it, I used crème fraiche instead of heavy cream (or like Chef John suggested; Cashews Cream) and it came out kind of grainy, the pan I chose didn't create enough fond either, so the flavors weren't as prominent.

No fret, though. It's an amazing dish, definitely gonna try it again and I will use the cashews method (Food Wishes on YT, if curious).

Good job on your tikka, it looks absolutely perfect."
