TrueOffMyChest,fe2i3nw,t3_enim3i,1578838562.0,"> Neurodiversity’s main concepts is that autistic and otherwise disabled people aren’t burdens who need to be “cured”...

If there were a safe way to revert autism, would you chose it and why (or why not)?

If there were a vaccine to prevent autism from ever developing in foeti, how would you feel about that?

You go on to say that ""Autism Parents... often portray us as monsters who need to be “cured”..."", so I'm a bit confused. Or surprised. 

I could understand two viewpoints -- 1. Autism grants special and extraordinary abilities that are worth keeping despite its costs in other areas of life, or 2. Autism causes problems and has no net benefit, so we should strive to cure it. 

Do you subscribe to 1?

> [they] say our self harming stims, meltdowns, ect are cause by our autism rather than lack of accommodations.

Not to be harsh, but when a group of people who are statistical outliers blames their problems on the failure of the 99.99% to give them permanent special treatment, I think they're fooling themselves. It might be nice if things worked that way, but there are 1000 other conditions with a prevalence around that of autism, most of which would benefit from special accommodations, and that's just impossible. For example, should all buildings have a padded room in case an epileptic has a grand mal seizure? Should all buildings and public transport have an oxygen machine in case someone who needs one's fails? Should all green stoplights and signs be changed to blue to accomodate the colorblind? Should all buildings have tinted windows and dim lighting for the photosensitive? Should all office chairs be rated for 400+ lbs for the morbidly obese? Should all buildings and vehicles be sterilized twice a day for the immune compromised?

These thing might all be nice, but society would go bankrupt long before the first 100 of the thousands of accomodations were implemented. 

Unfortunately, everyone must adapt to society to a large extent because the common denominator is the only viable thing to shoot for."
