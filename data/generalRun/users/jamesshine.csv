Renaming was popular in the 1960’s and later when setting up for 911 discovered redundant street names that caused confusion. Remember, John F.Kennedy and Martin Luther King streets didn’t exist prior to the 60’s. 

I have seen areas where the developers of the neighborhood used themes. Neighborhoods with streets all first names. Or a neighborhood with state names for all the streets. 

I had an aunt that lived on a street with her last name. Apparently the family originally owned all the property and developed it. The town let them name the new street whatever they wanted. Years passed, land was further broken up and sold, more houses built, and very few of the family that built it still lived on it."

I asked my grandmother about it before she passed.

So the logged info was two things, the best info provided by whoever was surveyed, and as accurate as written down by that particular census taker. 

Luckily, my family all around owned houses, so they had consistent addresses. My Italian side, the names are always botched terribly. To the point they are hard to find by name.  Had to use the address. Ages are all over the map. Adults a good 6-10 years off, kids 2."

Genealogy,ffzrppb,t1_ffzfsqm,1580390965.0,"Basically, if you have any New England roots, you could be one of the estimated 30 million that have some sort of relation to Mayflower passengers, direct (grandparent)  or indirectly (cousin). Most of the Mayflower main lines stuck to the area and those colonials were really good at procreation. You could have had an ancestor tap into that existing line in later years, or if you had family that lived in that region for any length of time, you might have multiple ancestors in that group."
Genealogy,ffyirah,t1_ffyftim,1580347402.0,"I totally agree. And that is the weird thing going on with these DNA tests. It is a powerful tool when used in conjunction with traditional genealogy. What was once a side feature, the ethnicity estimates, has become the primary reason many have done it. They put the most interest and faith into the least scientific component of the package."
Genealogy,ffxy4eq,t1_ffr3zsa,1580334704.0,"Yeah, same here. My great-grandparents lived in the same place for the final few decades of their life, and they never listed the same year twice. It ranged like 12 years. My great-grandmothers DOB was finally established via her baptism record, which fell in the dead middle of the rages shown."
Genealogy,ffxxe24,t3_evjz8j,1580334290.0,"My Colonial line has tons of intermarrying of families. First cousins was not unusual. I am fortunate in that so much of that line has been hammered out when there was a strong interest in documenting the colonials during the late 19th century. 

It also has sort of helped me figure out some loose ends. You can take advantage of the very clear trends to figure out who an unknown spouse was with just a birth date and a first name."
Genealogy,ffxvf7b,t3_evtatp,1580333188.0,"I wouldn’t look at the results as being iron clad proof. They use their database to try and estimate what your ancestry is. Estimation is just that. And as the database grows, it will evolve. But only as a reflection of the present. 

Also keep in mind that it wasn’t like Italians were  on an isolated island where they genetically were pure until a few hundred years ago. They constantly had people coming up from other countries, mixing in. That is why there are dark skinned Italians in the first place. They mixed in the Spanish, Greek, Arabs, etc. The farther north you travel, the more Northern European the people still look. Fare skinned, blue eyes, light hair.. etc."
madmen,ffxdkhe,t1_ffuriwp,1580322961.0,"Yes I do. They can do some amazing things. Often their biggest hurdle is matching materials. They pull off some real magic in that regard. Another thing that happens is they often bought multiples back when these items were new and have them in their inventory. That is a big reason you will see same outfits in multiple productions. They can not only choose a design they like, but have instant access to backups. Usually when they liquidate excess inventory, it is plain, somewhat generic items. But you can still find unusual stuff even in plain items. Like I have had backup shirts that were modified for stunt work that had internal reinforcements of seams so the clothing didn’t split apart during filming."
madmen,ffujan3,t1_ffu354y,1580243148.0,"Typically there are multiple on hand for any major production. They cannot risk a shoot if it gets damaged  or stained. If they find something they like and only have one, duplicates are made as backups."

It is interesting to note, the standardized version of my surname progressed about 50-75 years faster here in the US by by the first weave of Irish that came over in the 18th century than their families back in Ireland."

He never got over it. There was this trust issue that developed. People are not all the same.. but if you find it taking up a lot of your thoughts, seek some counseling. It isn’t weakness. It is a real challenge you might need some guidance to get through."

What I find myself doing is coming up with a list of potential people.. then I rough out a tree for each one. You start seeing little trends, maybe names, maybe places, or dates, associated with each. Before you know it, you know pretty quickly which documents go to which person. 

Within the past few months I had a really complex one. 3 guys, all cousins, same full name, all married women with the same first name, all roughly the same age living in the same town. All had tons of kids and used the same family names on them. I while I am certain I got it 80% sorted, I know there might be a couple items misplaced. All you can do is the best with what is available."

thesopranos,ffj9dev,t3_ett05y,1579993513.0,"I think he was looking for details so they could justify Vito getting a BJ from a guy. They could say “Well, maybe he is fat and ugly, his wife ain’t giving him anything, he did what we would do in jail.” By clarifying the detail it was Vito that went down, there was no way to justify it. And keep in mind, even with straight guys that is an issue. We saw their mindset of a man going down as weak. Add in the homosexual factor and it is just way too much to excuse."
AskReddit,ffj8tje,t3_etohsu,1579993171.0,"Just about everything when a vehicle is the focus of a scene. Screeching to a stop breaking, cars exploding, the ability to crash into things and keep driving (cars since the 80’s are so fragile in the nose, a hit over 20 miles an hour is going to wipe out the radiator), cars jumping and driving away, the list goes on and on. Anytime you see one car on screen doing anything beyond regular driving, they have a fleet of duplicates on hand to film that scene."
Genealogy,ffiwu34,t1_fficrhl,1579984643.0,"I just don’t understand their thought process. This isn’t a product that people need to buy more than once. To top it off, most people know someone that has done it.. they can get a first hand report of the experience, whereas before it was mysterious in a way. And I know plenty of people that if they have only marginal interest, they ask a sibling that has done it and scratches that itch. 

The troubling part is going to be when these companies really start feeling the hit after they sold kits to everybody that had an interest, the only valuable asset they have is that database. What will we see happen when executives who want to continue their big salaries start making decisions on how to exploit that database as it is the only asset left?"
