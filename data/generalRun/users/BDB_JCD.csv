Keep in mind algae is a very broad term that refers to wide variety of fresh and salt water organisms.

OP likely meant phytoplankton, which are an algae, and are negatively impacted by acidification.

Phytoplankton have calcium shells, which break down as acidity goes up, as well as produce a large portion (approx 50%) of oxygen on the planet through photosynthesis.

Phytoplankton are at the very base of the food web and preventing a collapse is crucial for the survival of humanity.

>The term ""algal bloom"" is defined inconsistently depending on the scientific field and can range between a ""minibloom"" of harmless algae to a large, harmful bloom event.[4] Since 'algae' is a broad term including organisms of widely varying sizes, growth rates, and nutrient requirements, there is no officially recognized threshold level as to what is defined as a bloom. 

>Blooms are the result of a nutrient that the particular algae need being introduced to the local aquatic system. This growth-limiting nutrient is typically nitrogen or phosphorus, but can also be iron, vitamins, or amino acids.[3] There are several mechanisms for the addition of these nutrients in water. In the open ocean and along coastlines, upwelling from both winds and topographical ocean floor features can draw nutrients to the photic, or sunlit zone of the ocean.[10] Along coastal regions and in freshwater systems, agricultural, city, and sewage runoff can cause algal blooms.[11] Two examples of anthropogenic algal blooms in the United States are in Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico.[12]

> Phytoplankton absorb energy from the Sun and nutrients from the water to produce their own nourishment or energy. In the process of photosynthesis, phytoplankton release molecular oxygen (O
2) into the water as a waste byproduct. It is estimated that about 50% of the world's oxygen is produced via phytoplankton photosynthesis.[30] The rest is produced via photosynthesis on land by plants.[30] Furthermore, phytoplankton photosynthesis has controlled the atmospheric CO
2/O2 balance since the early Precambrian Eon.[31]

>The effects of anthropogenic ocean acidification on phytoplankton growth and community structure has also received considerable attention. Phytoplankton such as coccolithophores contain calcium carbonate cell walls that are sensitive to ocean acidification. Because of their short generation times, evidence suggests some phytoplankton can adapt to changes in pH induced by increased carbon dioxide on rapid time-scales (months to years)"

You would have the line ready for a west side terminal at ORD, significantly improve connectivity between Pace and the CTA, give people living west of ORD an excellent non driving option to get to the airport, and get a lot of commuters off the Kennedy where even a fractional drop in cars at peak times would significantly improve congestion.

Jesus how short sighted do you have to be to not see the benefits of more effective policing and lower crime rates even if you don’t live in the city/neighborhood.

“Sure that guy is a murder, but he didn’t murder anyone I know so why am II paying for his prosecution?”

“If that family wants justice for their murdered loved one they should pay for the prosecution themselves.”

It’s mind boggling.

A safer neighborhood means residents going out more and spending in the local community, which means more jobs, and it also means higher property values.

Which in turn means more revenue from sales tax, payroll taxes, and property taxes.

Neighborhoods with lower crime rates also have greater physical and mental health which means lower disability, even less crime, and even improves educational outcomes for kids who live there all of which accrues to a better society and quality of life for everyone.
