facepalm,ffh70i6,t1_ffh074s,1579924886.0,"I had some friends who’s kids went through this therapy. They were epipen level allergic to all nuts (one so much so that the dust off a bag of peanuts would set him off). Doctor started them on really tiny slivers of cashews and peanuts — like microgram sizes, mixed with water — and basically kept increasing the dosage slowly until they were eventually up to a whole nut. If they had a reaction he’d back up and start all over.

To my understanding the goal wasn’t to get them able to eat nuts normally, so much it was just to make the accidental ingestion of one or two non-lethal."
Anarcho_Capitalism,ffegpab,t3_esx6pm,1579847322.0,"Cuz more laws makes all the mean trolli bois go away. Isn’t that right, mommy?

I really don’t know if I should laugh or cry anymore."
earrumblersassemble,ffbeqbb,t1_ffba7u3,1579762111.0,They are normal. Just not everyone can do it on command. I’m apparently one of the rare breed who can rumble and click both. Judging by the reaction I’m assuming you are as well.
earrumblersassemble,ffaw5dy,t3_esm7dm,1579745877.0,"It could be the same. Crackling while rumbling is usually a sign of a problem though (not *usually* serious — like swimmers ear).

If it’s a short popping/crackling sensation that you can only sustain for a split second at a time, you are actually opening and closing your Eustachian tubes. It’s a similar sensation to relieving pressure with altitude changes."
AskReddit,ffao95e,t1_ffamqz9,1579740607.0,"I used to get blamed for this stuff all the time too! Stopped doing friendly work and no more blaming. 

Sorry grandma, you did it to yourself."

Good to know they keep expanding though."
nashville,fevgkqg,t1_feu2muj,1579397132.0,TIL there is a McKay’s in the Nashville metro.
Chattanooga,fevg93f,t1_femg4jo,1579396991.0,I’d argue Bradley Square isn’t really dead. It’s just a small private mall. Eastgate literally has nothing interesting in it.
Chattanooga,fen6pbw,t3_eq0ro3,1579278171.0,[Holder Roofing](https://www.chattanoogaroofer.com/)  did a good job on my stuff.
kotor,felpcjf,t1_felanvy,1579227670.0,"There is a tie-in novel called “Revan” also, that deals with the story leading into TOR. I think it’s set a good deal beforehand timeline wise, iirc. Immediately after KOTOR2."

Chattanooga,fehbbab,t1_fedtmwo,1579113029.0,"I’m 30. It was probably closer to 25 or more. I remember going with my dad to get a car stereo installed at CC off of Gunbarrel, this was probably mid/late-90s, so it was definitely before then.

The building I always remember being McKay is the Spanish Church you refer to."
boomershumor,fegpyix,t1_fegko3d,1579099774.0,"I made this same argument years ago, along with nearly all of my classmates about the class requirements. The line I got fed from faculty was “we want you to have a well rounded education”. I got so frustrated with it, I eventually dropped out of college."
boomershumor,fegpg0f,t1_fegm0cn,1579099420.0,"Even then the financial aid is a sham that is partly to blame for the increase in college costs to begin with, especially the programs that everyone qualifies for. Say the government gives you $1800 a semester for assistance, sounds like a good thing... but instead of using it to foot the bill, universities just see that they can charge $1800 *more* per semester now."
Chattanooga,fedly9i,t1_fedigg5,1579014780.0,"Circuit City? I remember when it was on Lee Hwy. 

To my knowledge CC was always off of Gunbarrel where Academy is, but McKay wasn’t there. Was this before my time?"

Liberty_Memes,fdsnaqz,t3_emzof8,1578705447.0,They went to IG last time. I imagine that will happen again. The constant banning and unbanning on FB is getting old.
boomershumor,fdrydb5,t1_fdqy8ng,1578691554.0,The scary thing is wondering if we are going to be doing this to the future generation in ~30 years.

memes,fdo90mr,t1_fdo86tt,1578600972.0,I think they were referring to the meme. The order the prints happened is “FAILEDPASSED”. Yours would be reversed.
StarWars,fdnxs57,t1_fdnwss4,1578595012.0,Well Yoda said he would be a Jedi Knight when he faced Vader. So it wasn’t totally his own say-so.
Anarcho_Capitalism,fdmco45,t1_fdm8r9h,1578545684.0,What’s the difference tho? All signs point to the motherland.
earrumblersassemble,fdax9s7,t1_fd8oeb7,1578251470.0,Can confirm the confirmation. I used to be able to do the ringing as well (but apparently I grew out of it as it doesn’t seem to work for me anymore)... but I’ve always been able to rumble.
Chattanooga,fd3kunw,t3_ejz0w0,1578159246.0,I feel like I’ve been hearing more about these than normal lately.

earrumblersassemble,fcn60pl,t3_ehs9xw,1577804193.0,"I can pop my ears on command like you, as far as I know I’ve always been able to. I wouldn’t say my ears feel permanently blocked though. I’d be curious if you have a minor deformity in your Eustachian tubes, or maybe some scarring as a result of a bad sinus infection."
starwarsmemes,fcn23f4,t3_ei2pmu,1577801086.0,I was pleasantly surprised. It felt like a Star Wars movie to me. I personally like it more than RO (that obviously being my personal taste). It stands as the only Disney Star Wars movie I’ve watched more than 3 times.
StarWarsArmada,fcka83f,t3_ehmvd1,1577720694.0,"The FFG website has an [upcoming page](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/upcoming/). You can filter by reprint and such there.

xboxone,fc9f5vm,t1_fc9c2rk,1577551769.0,Bots can read codes from pictures. That’s why captcha images are so obscure and hard to read. It’s basically the same tech that allows you to scan a gift card and pick up the numbers.
