And while I'm glad to hear of your success, I'd say that entirely training out separation anxiety in a couple of days is not a typical result. Most major behavioral issues take significantly longer than that and can require professional help. All I'm saying is that if you see a dog misbehaving, it doesn't automatically mean that the owner is lazy or uninformed or doesn't care. Sometimes they are trying damn hard and progress just takes a while."
aww,ffkaawy,t1_ffk0e21,1580019520.0,"Agreed. When we first brought our heeler home, he would go from quiet to biting in the blink of an eye. It was scary. Took a lot of work and a lot of time, but now he will growl when he's uncomfortable and we know to immediately remove him from that situation. People think I'm crazy when I don't get upset about his growl, but its actually a good thing compared to the alternative."
BeAmazed,ffk5mo9,t1_ffjzp9n,1580016640.0,"While I agree that positive reinforcement is certainly the best way to train a dog, this is a wild over simplification. Sure, training a dog to sit or stay generally isn't too difficult, with practice, patience and lots of treats.

But how do you train a dog that is reactive or aggressive? They don't give a shit if you tell them to sit when they are over threshold and hyper focused on their stimulant. Or how about resource guarding or separation anxiety? These things take *years* to overcome. I'm definitely not saying that hurting/correcting a dog is the answer here. In almost all cases that only makes the problem worse. I'm just pointing out that dog training isnt always as simple as you are making it out to be. 

Also, 'correcting' a dog by yelling/hitting/whatever is actually positive punishment, not negative reinforcement."
