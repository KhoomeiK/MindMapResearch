Your ears absolutely stand-out and take away from your face. Your face is really adorable, and you have great facial features-- but your ears distract from that, a lot, when visible. That doesn't make you ugly, though.


Having minor surgery on your ears to shrink them a bit and/or tack them back more would benefit your entire look greatly. That, or just wear your hair over both of your ears instead of off to one side, only covering one. I only say these things as suggestions based on the assumption that your ears weigh on your own self-image, and when you feel better about the way you look, you're more confident and happy in general.

Yeah, the dirty doctor issue needs to be addressed more seriously, but helping people with anxiety with education/alt treatments, and even addressing the fact that some patients need benzo treatment, as well as doing proper research on the growing prevalence of anxiety disorders (the number of cases are rising due to x, y, & z-- and even because, not that there are that many more cases alone, but self-reporting is increasing due to less stigma/taboo being attached to admitting there's a problem and that professional intervention is needed) should be of equal import."

AskReddit,fcz1xz7,t1_fcxdqeq,1578092031.0,"This is my mom. She has had so many animals, usually 5-6 at a time. It has just been a thing ever since I can remember. When I was little, everyone in the neighborhood came to know her as the local animal shelter alternative- if they found stray or injured animals (including baby birds or squirrels, whatever random wildlife, fallen out of nests or whose parents had been killed by another animal; a guy even brought her a baby deer once after accidentally hitting the pregnant mother deer with his truck and then cutting the baby out before it died, too [he was a hunter]). What they didn't know is that she is the most irresponsible pet owner I have ever personally known.


I can't even count how very, very many animals died horrible and slow and painful deaths under her ""care"". Deaths usually related to absolute neglect or just carelessness; a few have made it to old age, but had zero quality of life for months or even years due to untreated illness, injury, or just some type of condition which could have been better managed through care or should have been a sign that the animal deserved the mercy of being put to sleep.


I have so many disgusting stories of her maltreatment which amounted to torture for these poor souls, but there is a current issue that has me taking action today. 


She has this dog, and he was pretty old when she got him (he was her MIL's; MIL passed away; mom demanded the dog be put under her care instead of going to another family member). As I said, he was pretty old, but had aged really well because he was well cared for at home and taken to vet for check ups.


In the 2 years since she has had this dog, I have watched him go from  happy and loving and playful, to always filthy and skinny and only able to walk with front 2 legs (dragging the back legs behind him) and whimpering, sometimes screaming out in pain when he gets into a position that hurts and can't get himself out of on his own. My mom and I have an awful relationship for myriad reasons, but this kind of thing is the #1 problem. I refuse to be silent now that I am older and understand how fucked up it is to be an irresponsible pet owner. I check on the dog often and we fight on a regular basis about taking him to the vet. It has now gotten to the point where the dog just absolutely needs to be put to sleep. She just says, ""I know. I will make an appointment. I just don't want to deal with that today."" but nothing ever happens, and so we fight horribly about this constantly bc I refuse to let it go. I was really hoping she would come to her senses and have the vet come to the house and let the dog die in the ""comfort"" of familiar surroundings and with familiar people around, opposed to on a steel table with strangers.


Either way, I am done. I have an interview today, and will be snatching the dog after. If I had the money, I would help the dog in any way I could, but I am absolutely flat broke and have no money coming in anytime in the foreseeable future. So, I am going to take the dog and go to the local animal shelter and tell them I found him on the side of the road (his appearance will not contest this story) and that I just couldn't leave him there. I know that they will make him as comfortable as possible and allow him to pass in peace, ending his suffering. I say I know they will take great care of him because over the years I have done a lot of volunteer work for the specific place I am going to take him to.



I just hate myself for not doing this sooner. I just couldn't think of a way around the issues of money and the fact that he is not my dog. I have reported her in the past for things like this and nothing is ever done about it. All that has ever happened is someone, usually a police officer and a person from animal control, comes out and talks to her and suggests some things and she gives her innocent old lady with good intentions and love for her pets act, either severely downplaying or outright lying about their conditions. The officers are usually won over by and completely fall for her bullshit and story about how I exaggerate or only called out of personal spite for some unrelated issue, because, you know, ""she's always been a vindictive child..."" and all.


There was once a situation that they could not miss, regarding open wounds on one of her past dogs, and when they brought it up, she assured them that she had been treating them and keeping them clean, and that he had an appointment at the vet for that afternoon (none of which was true). For clarification: she did not create the wounds, the dog developed a sort of anxiety disorder due to negligence and isolation and also was old, with very bad hips that caused considerable pain, and he started obsessively chewing/biting & pulling/licking himself in the same couple of spots. The result was very nasty open wounds that never healed.


I hate, with a passion, people who do not take care of their pets, no matter what type, in the way that they need and deserve to be taken care of. These are sentient beings who have been domesticated and brought home for our amusement, and they are 100% helpless, at the mercy of whoever owns them. 



There are a lot more details about this entire situation, but I have already written a novel here.
Some people should not be allowed to have pets, and my mother is one of them. Reports of neglect should be investigated thoroughly, without the bar being set so low that an animal has to basically be beyond medical intervention to help, with severe punishments for those who fail to care for them properly."
