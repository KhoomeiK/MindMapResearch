AskMen,fcu816q,t3_eimia6,1577974750.0,"Honestly there are a TON of body weight exercises that should be more then enough to start you off. 

Do a good mix of cardio and strength to start, and then tailor your workouts to what you need! 

For cardio you can do stuff as simple as running up and down the stairs, jumping jacks, jump rope, running, jogging, biking, even a brisk walk if you aren’t up for a run! 

For strength exercises, squats, lunges, pushups, sit-ups, planks, tons of core exercises, and much more that you can look up online with “body weight strength exercise”. A lot of these you can ramp up the intensity by adding weights (and honestly, you don’t always need to pay for dumbbells, a gallon of water can help you with squats etc until you build up your strength!) 

Don’t feel like you need to spend a ton of money to start- if you are out of shape, doing the above should challenge you enough to start!"

casualiama,fcbwpre,t1_fcbrgyv,1577591814.0,"Hi! I stayed in student-housing-in-the-school-year-hostel-in-the-summer type of situation as sort of a â€œBaseâ€ for a few weeks. They charged a flat rate for a certain number of nights that was very affordable (I roomed with two other people). It was in a cheaper part of Austria that was pretty central to travel from. 

Before I went, I had planned a lot of my travel trips with a few friends to different cities. We did this by using google flights and choosing â€œflexibleâ€ dates, and then finding the dirt-cheapest housing possible. Usually this was either a hostel or surprisingly, small Airbnbâ€™s. 

I walked a LOT. Took a lot of trains. 

Biggest thing I learned was DO NOT BE AFRAID TO WALK. As long as you are with friends and in a generally safe location, you can walk considerable distances and not be tired, especially if the weather is good. So book your rooms away from city centers, and walk in to a train station or bus station and get to the city center of wherever you are going that way. 


Way too much for one post but 

TLDR: google flights, walking, Airbnb, book stuff WAY in advance"
