TwoXChromosomes,fe6fyda,t1_fe6fbjn,1578889719.0,Huh? He’s just a man that’s comfortable with himself and knows kindness has more power than anything. He absolutely stands up for himself. And has been open with me if I hurt him. Sounds like you don’t have a clue what a healthy and happy marriage should look like and you’re probably single.
fatlogic,fe6ft28,t3_enqy84,1578889597.0,"My trans friend recently got her confirmation surgery. She got the consultation a year before. The doctor told her she had to lost 85lbs before she could get approved for surgery.

So you know what she did? She lost 85lbs. And got the surgery. And healed quite well.

Crazy, huh? That she trusted the doctor knew what he was saying and applied the advice? That she knew she wanted this surgery and had to take responsibility and get in shape for it?"
TwoXChromosomes,fe0a15f,t1_fe09hs4,1578807338.0,"Oh, trust me, I do. 24/7. We are absolute soulmates and I tell him every single day how much he means to me.

I just wanted to share with others. I’m sorry if my intention seemed different."

offmychest,fe07krf,t3_enbtrx,1578805173.0,"It’s very brave of you to admit your truth. I know it’s hard, but you have such a wonderful life to look forward to now that you understand yourself better. I hope you can find a wonderful woman who makes you truly happy."
Advice,fdohttd,t3_embukr,1578605436.0,"Yep! Do what makes you comfortable! If it helps, I’m a woman and I wouldn’t think anything of it if I saw a man wearing one. As others have stated, if you’re self conscious you could always wear a baggy shirt or a hoodie over."
fatlogic,fdohnvp,t1_fdnhcpn,1578605343.0,Right? I run half marathons and play roller derby. I’m good.
offmychest,fcbhw7i,t3_egx238,1577587066.0,"I’m so sorry for your loss. Remember that there’s no one correct way to grieve, so allow yourself to grieve however feels best for you. Big hugs."
offmychest,fc06smu,t3_efbuqt,1577281041.0,That’s adorable.
