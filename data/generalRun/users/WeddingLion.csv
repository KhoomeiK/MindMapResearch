At first, I thought some of their points were okay, like you paying for gas etc. But you shouldn't be responsible for gas and tolls for picking up your siblings or family errands.

movies,fdfh8bz,t1_fdfgjbj,1578361633.0,"That's fair. 

I think this is a minority of people, but I watch everything in subtitles. I had a friend that was hearing impaired, so he used them. I found them annoying at first, but I realized that I started picking up on subtle jokes, references, puns, etc in movies I thought I knew inside and out.

So that's why I do that, but if I didn't already watch movies in English wish English subtitles, I'm sure I would never have noticed otherwise."
movies,fdfg7we,t1_fdff2l7,1578360966.0,"That's somewhat reasonable, and I made another comment about that, but I personally would rather that they match.

But I'm not in charge. Oh, well. Still like foreign movies, sometimes."
movies,fdffk95,t1_fdfeqhl,1578360524.0,"That is fair. Phrases take a different number of syllables in different languages. 

But they definitely try to fit a dubbed phrase that LOOKS the way their mouth moves into a shot. Would it not be equally or even more easily done to use a different camera perspective instead of changing the dialogue?

Ie if ""it's raining cats and dogs"" were to be translated into a different language, and that language needed a different amount of time to express, could they not use a regional colloquialism, and change the shot to the person they're speaking to, or a landscape or something?

Cost, I guess."
movies,fdfei0r,t1_fdfdrx4,1578359809.0,"Because they consistently conflict, and the whole post is about subtitled movies. 

I do like foreign films, but I have to be in the right mood to watch one that I have to read at the same time. If the dialogue matched the subtitles, it would engage me differently. 

Language is not x = y. Things are always lost in translation. We've all seen examples where the literal translation doesn't express a metaphor correctly. So some things have to be restated. But that restatement is irrelevant pertaining to verbal vs subtitles. 

They should match. I can't think of an argument why they shouldn't.

Edit: I suppose that doesn't answer your question exactly of why one is more accurate, but I think it's pretty obvious that they should match, and I'm asking why they don't/can't/won't."
