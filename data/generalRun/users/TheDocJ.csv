I have been dealing with repeated iterations of NHS IT, which once again is more likely to make my job harder, if only to fight againt the distortions it introduces to clinical priorities. Have newer versions, made possible by newer computer technology, improved that? No, because those in charge have specified more and more largely superfluous bells and whistles which may keep the bureaucrats in data, but at best do nothing to make front-line patient care any easier.

Yes, that is rather my point. If you are happy to pay higher prices because the technology makes it easier for the dishonest to cheat, then fine. Perhaps you would be happy to subsidise me a small amount every time *I* do a shop?

I used to challenge NHS management like this: If you want me to use new technological innovations, then provide me with ones that either make it possible for me to do my job of caring for patients better, or make it easier for me to do my job.

Where does it say that? Romans again:

""What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?""

Professing with no serious intent to follow is precisely the point of the ""Not all who say to me 'Lord, Lord'..."" I mentioned above. In full, Matthew 7:21:

""“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."" The saying ""Lord, Lord"" is (part of) the professing, the doing the will is the following. Bible makes it clear that both are needed.

Again, I will point out that it is not the doing the will that *earns* the place in heaven, it is the evidence that they *mean* what they profess.

MurderedByWords,fedzizg,t1_fedp5dt,1579023182.0,"> In one version one person finds the tomb. In another there are a dozen. In one version there is a mighty earthquake not mentioned in the others. Some versions have the tomb still closed and others open. 

At least report what the Bible says accurately. Matthew mentioned Mary Magdalene and another Mary, and although not clear, seems to suggest that the stne was rolled back while they were on their way. Mark doesn't mention going to the tomb at all. Luke says ""the women"", and John says Mary Magdalene first (doesn't say whether she was alone or not) then Peter and John once she had told them. All the accounts than mention it say Mary was the first person to meet Jesus. 

Goodness knows where you get *a dozen* from.

More like one person saying they saw the butler in the parlour, another saying in the dining room."

I once went for an interview where the female interviewer - who I knew a bit already - was wearing a very short skirt - and she sat partly sideways on her chair with her knees pointing towards me. She was an attractive women, ten years older than me, and I was happily married, but it was difficult not to at least feel that I kept looking at her thighs - mostly because I found I was trying to look absolutely anywhere else.

I didn't get the job! But I was assured afterwards by one of the other interviewers that he hadn't noticed anything amiss, but I think it did affect my concentration a bit.

I am sure that *some* people would say that I was being a disgusting mcp fr even thinking that her clothing was perhaps inappropriate, but would they be just as supportive of a man interviewing a younger woman wearing a shirt open to the waist or a pair of tight lycra shorts with a prominent bulge?
