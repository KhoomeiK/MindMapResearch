BodyDysmorphia,fepur3n,t3_eqbeqr,1579332009.0,"Yeah, I hate my side profile, and it's so frustrating to see pretty much everyone else having almost perfect side profiles.  
And my face when I smile with teeth, oof. I don't even know why, but it looks awful."
SSRIs,fdronja,t3_emw4p2,1578687447.0,"I've been on lexapro for about 4.5 months. I don't remember how long it lasted for me, but I was more tired for at least a couple of weeks after starting it. You should talk to your doctor, maybe you can get a lower dose or switch to something else, but I suppose it's not uncommon for side effects to last up to 3 months... I think... but you should still talk to your doctor about it since it bothers you."
depression,fdo8btg,t3_emet3q,1578600640.0,"That's great! And you should be proud!  
Going to your doctor to get help is a huge step, and a difficult one (for me, it was probably the hardest thing I'd ever done)."
depression,fdo7p5i,t3_emc5hh,1578600332.0,"That warning sounds a bit too extreme, my meds just say that it's not recommended to drink while on antidepressants, but I do, and for me it has been mostly fine, although after getting to 15 mg of cipralex, I can go from 30% drunk to 100% very fast, and I black out more than normal, so I've decided to pretty much stop drinking for now.  
I don't think the occational glass of wine or beer should be a problem, but everyone's different, so you don't know how you'll react."
socialanxiety,fdo6s7f,t3_emd5hw,1578599881.0,"I can completely relate. I'm 26F, in college, and haven't been able to make a single new friend in 2.5 years. I just don't know how to talk to people, and it makes me feel really shitty about myself. Like you, I can see that everyone's found their group of people while I'm just all alone all the time. I guess it's for the best though, cause it's easier that way..."
BodyDysmorphia,fdo54ct,t3_emelcm,1578599059.0,"Yeah, my friends say that as well, and others I've known, but it doesn't help at all. I think it's made things worse by making me feel like I have to live up to a standard that I feel I can't meet."
DysmorphicDisorder,fdnhu9b,t3_embdo8,1578586119.0,"I understand how you feel, and that it feels impossible to accept your height. It's far too common to hear about girls not wanting to date guys that are below a certain height (which is such effing absurd).  
I'm 26F, and sure, I've always liked the idea of being with a tall dude, (largely because I for some reason feel big (I'm 168 cm, and have always been skinny lol)), but I would never dismiss someone because of their height. Both my sisters are dating guys that are definitely around your height (my sisters are around 164-165 cm). Knowing how bdd is, I know this probably won't help you much, especially in the long run... but I hope it can make you feel at least a little bit better."
depression,fdn4eyl,t3_em9f5k,1578576967.0,"Yeah, kinda. I can barely bring myself to study even though I know it's important and that I'll just hate myself more if I don't. But at the same time it feels pointless, both because it feels awful to try and fail, but also because I don't believe I'll get anywhere no matter what I do. But also, maybe I'm just lazy and am just coming up with excuses."
depression,fdjl1p6,t3_elm8bm,1578475930.0,"Damn, I feel the exact same way about all of it.  
Uni has been a bit easier after I got meds, but I've still failed two classes even though I actually studied for one of them and it really just made me spiral. It really feels as though I'm not cut out for life.

Like someone before me said, therapy could be helpful. Also, would it be possible for you to reduce the workload in uni? I know it might delay finishing your degree, but that's not the end of the world (even though it totally sucks when it seems like everyone else are managing to do what they're ""supposed"" to)"
SSRIs,fdjjo7s,t3_ellfsi,1578473954.0,"I stopped getting too overwhelmed when trying to study for exams, and made me more able to actually stick to the study plan I made. I'm still failing classes though, but I've only been on meds since august so hopefully I'll see some more improvements this coming semester."
depression,fdgaf7j,t3_el7p7n,1578387088.0,"I've been thinking that a lot more lately. But as kind of a way to make myself feel better, or not care as much about what people thing about me cause no one can hate me more than I can."
BodyDysmorphia,fd4mrbq,t1_fd4hm77,1578168993.0,"I guess it depends a bit, but it probably wouldn't bother me."
BodyDysmorphia,fd4hc0y,t3_ejzi9a,1578167429.0,"26f here, I have a receded chin as well, and I hate it. And my nose and forehead along with it makes my side profile look kinda like a half circle with a nose sticking out."
SSRIs,f95wq33,t3_e3zhtp,1575136447.0,"Hmm, I'm not sure about this. But I know that for escitalopram, nausea is a side effect, but maybe that's not what you've described. I did notice on escitalopram that I started getting some acid reflux which can feel like there's something kinda stuck in your throat (and it made me feel like I was gonna throw up), not sure it that sounds familiar?"
