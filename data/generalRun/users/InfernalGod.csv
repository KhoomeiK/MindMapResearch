Honestly, I’m a super nice person irl and online.

Sometimes rage is the most delicious thing in the world and I think it adds and element of control into our lives. It’s like vigilante justice and the more you doll it out the better you feel knowing you’re knocking the bastard down a peg or two. It’s probably not the healthiest thing ever but honestly, I feel like you don’t have to cut it out of your life. 


Sometimes I just love being a complete cunt. Usually when playing video games. I love doing dumb shit that makes the enemy rage and I shit you not when I say it fuels my soul. 

“Who the fuck qued us up for easy bots?”

“How do I turn up the bot difficulty?”

“Man terrorist hunt is easy.”

Sometimes the best troll is just making people rage and not even saying anything. You can tell if people are mad by how they play and you steamroll them so hard and say nothing because your dominance speaks for itself.

Anyway, my point is that it’s not necessarily something that you need to hate about yourself or feel uncomfortable with. You can tone it down, and find your inner trolling finesse to become the ultimate master of your emotions and the emotions of those you deem worthy of your righteous judgment.

offmychest,feiej1s,t1_feidpuf,1579136659.0,"I think one thing you have to understand is that people used to have to live that way. I’m not saying they should be hunting at age ten, but you need to know that people who hunt actually respect the animals a lot more than people who work at and eat from factory farms. The conditions in which the animals are kept in and slaughtered in are downright cruel and horrific. At least when someone goes hunting that animal had a good life for the most part and the hunter will use almost every thing from that animal for the next few months."

I honestly felt trapped and near suicidal before I decided to give up. Sometimes giving up is the healthiest solution. I think social pressures to be with someone are bullshit.

Now obviously I still feel lonely but I try to cancel that feeling out with reading romance fics or novels. If I empathize with the characters enough I feel those feelings of adoration and love and I don’t feel so lonely anymore. I think reading these things has helped me overcome a lot of loneliness but I don’t know if it’s for everyone. It also helps that I made some great friends along the way."

offmychest,fehs0ry,t1_fehqz92,1579122724.0,"Hmm I think you should try to find groups of people that share your interests or if you have time join some kind of sport. Honestly Reddit is amazing for finding people to talk to. Even if it’s not that personal you can find some great people, maybe become good friends. Heck maybe even go on the Reddit for that subject that you enjoy and ask about meeting people up near the area you live. Maybe take your husband along for safety but I feel like you can find people if you really branch out.

One of the good things about living in the US is that there will always be someone with common interests around unless you live out in the boonies. I for one like writing and reading and so I branch out over the internet and find communities that also love writing. I have a lot of close friends irl but I also have people that mean a great deal to me over the net. One of my best friends in real life is someone I met over Xbox live 11 years ago.
