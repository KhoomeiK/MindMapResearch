bipolar,feoiqoy,t1_feo5cit,1579300747.0,And I dont want to feel this overwhelming hostility.
bipolar,fenszlf,t3_eq27y8,1579290312.0,"I struggle with this exact thing. I do a lot of weird shit when manic, and then feel embarrassed enough to want to kill myself over it later. But look at it this way, its in the past now. 

Look around at where you are now, and focus on the good things here and now. Don’t panic about the future and don’t drown in the past. 

Stay here and now."
bipolar,fenrt89,t3_eq1taz,1579289844.0,This is one of my favorite songs of all time.
bipolar,femr0uh,t3_epz1jz,1579267103.0,"I feel kind of the opposite. Its very hard for me to make friends. I don’t let people into my life very often. But when I do, i struggle with idea of maybe my friends genuinely don’t like me, because of the weird shit i might have done while manic, or shutting them out when I’m depressed."
bipolar,fekwzy4,t3_epnkfw,1579209342.0,"I thought my female friend at work, who i confessed my love for early last year, was sleeping with another one of my male friends afterwards just to get back at me and show how much of a loser i am. This was all based on their timing of coming into work at the same time every now and then. That is simply the gist of it. What was really happening in my brain i will never find the proper words for."
bipolar,fekwhai,t3_epoic0,1579209034.0,"I got in so much credit card debt because of amazon. Its too easy to buy shit, especially with our conditions."
bipolar,fekw6bx,t3_eppk4h,1579208856.0,At least it looks cool.
bipolar,fehtk4m,t3_ep8alj,1579123590.0,"I read three Stephen Kings books then decided I was going to read everything he wrote, so now i have an entire bookshelf of unread books. Was going to get into retro video games because new games suck, so i bought an old CRT television and a bunch of old consoles and games. Only played a few. Was going to mine bitcoin so I built an entirely new gaming PC and havent turned it on or even connected to the internet with it. Kayak fishing was a thing for a while, bought a kayak and poles. Was going to get back into guitar (ive played for about 20 years off and on) so i ran out and bought a $3000 gibson les paul with barely even thinking it through. I got a piano. A mountain bike because trails are cool. A ton of expensive Warhammer 40k shit, played three games. Comic book collecting. Nintendo Amiibo collecting. A brand new TRD Off Road 4Runner because now im going to be an “overlander” and travel the U.S. on trails and national forests. I signed up for jiu jitsu for a year and only did six months at most. Man, i think i can just keep going."
bipolar,fehgxlf,t3_ep5vu8,1579116309.0,"Thats neat. 

My most recent one was an air fryer. But my best one was a brand new $42,000 TRD Off Road 4Runner."
bipolar,fegylx5,t1_feguhtk,1579105418.0,"Yea so i got tired of generic ass depression, because i knew there was something else wrong. I did alot of my own research, asked my mom about her mental health and bipolar and remembered that her brother was schizophrenic. Its genetic. Then i finally made a psych appointment. She asked “so what brings you in” i didn’t hesitate “i think i have bipolar.  And explained everything from there on. First she was thinking i was bipolar type 2 until i told her about my psychotic paranoia episodes.  

I was on zoloft before, i couldnt take it for more than three days though. It felt weird. 

If you feel like you have mania, please tell your psych. Mine told me that everyone knows what depression is, but most never realize they have manic episodes because they feel great and arent depressed."
bipolar,fegtph7,t3_ep1s9y,1579102310.0,"I was just diagnosed with type 1 yesterday. Have experienced EVERYTHING you mentioned except the hallucinations. Even the bike thing, but mine was a CRT TV so i could hook up old video game consoles. I only played one game on it, 8 months ago. 

So it might be type 1."
bipolar,fegenel,t1_fegee2l,1579090128.0,"Thanks for sharing. Im most worried about akathisia. Did the start-up side effects go away, and if so how long did they last?"
bipolar,fege78b,t3_ep16ba,1579089627.0,I do that with retro video games. Are you watching on a CRT tv as well?
bipolar,fdq8t41,t1_fdpch0f,1578659533.0,"I read three Stephen King books. After Misery, all of a sudden i had to read everything he’s ever written. Bought a ton of shit i havent read two years later. Then I had to had all first editions for some reason. Still havent read them. My new project is the entire Dark Tower series. On book 2 of 8. Wish me luck i actually finish."
classicwow,fdh0opx,t3_elaba7,1578412820.0,"Every time im in a Garr fight, i like to banish nipple. So when it breaks i can say “condom broke!” Childish i know, but its the little things."
bipolar,fczvlc7,t1_fcziw9p,1578109361.0,"Good to read that you’ve had a good run. Im not looking forward to meds and the side effects, but it might be worth it. 

I have already asked a close friend to hold my firearms in his safe for a while. I have five of them and it might be for the best until i find stable ground. 

Thanks for your comment."

bipolar,fcovj8c,t3_ei8a0t,1577842730.0,"I am 33. After the shit show of a rollercoaster that 2019 was, i realize i most likely have bipolar disorder, not just general depression. I just made my very first psychiatrist appointment today. 

If only i had realized what mania really was before i got $21,000 in credit card debt and had to refinance my house. If only i realized what mania really was before i ruined my closest friendships. If only i realized what mania really was before i had so much sex it literally caused permanent injury.

I finally realized it is time to get help after putting a loaded 9mm under my chin. 

At least i finally took the first step to getting help. We shall see what the verdict is soon. Looking back at all the tunnel-visioned highs and life threatening lows, i may have been dealing with this for about 8 years and never noticed."
bipolar,fcorwq8,t1_ey068fr,1577839902.0,I was just thinking the same.
classicwow,fc5appk,t3_eg1f8d,1577451324.0,"On Grobbulus there is a troll, multiple trolls, that path from the bank, mailbox, AH with their guild name as a gold website advertisement. Its an auto bot path. I report it everyday, and everyday hes still there. Or has a new character doing the same thing."
classicwow,fbp7b5u,t3_dzx812,1577018243.0,This isnt acceptable. It still needs to be removed.
