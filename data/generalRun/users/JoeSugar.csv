Check out what Druid City Brewery has to offer. Lots of cool music there. (Near Hackberry and 15th Street)
Check out the usual spots on The Strip and Temerson Square (Downtown). Avenue Pub there has a good rotation of beers and a damn good burger. 
Check out Alcove (Downtown) for cocktails, Loosa Brews for craft beers.

Nicks in the Sticks. Great, cheap filet. Order a Nicodemus to drink. 
Archibald’s (the original off MLK in Northport) for barbecue. Then go to the original Dreamland (off Jug Factory Road in Jerusalem Heights). Decide for yourself if you agree with most locals that Dreamland is most famous but Archibald’s is better. 
Oasis in Cottondale. It’s a smoke-filled dive that smells like an ashtray, but get a cheeseburger and a beer and fall in love. BTW, the double combo is cheaper than a single. 
Lake Nicole and other nearby areas are great for outdoor hiking.
If you like fishing, this is paradise. Holt Lake and the river south of town is great for boating and fishing. Lake Tuscaloosa is wonderful for boating but not great fishing.

We don’t use it much for trim but it is great for cabinets. But you’ve got to know what you’re doing with it. It dries super fast and you cannot overwork it. It is self-leveling but if you over work it, you’ll start seeing brush strokes. 
I would definitely recommend practicing with it  before trying it out on cabinets. 
That said, they turn out beautifully and once it cures, it has a very durable finish. 
And the spread rate is insane. It goes a very long way. 
The only problem is it is expensive as hell. Like $90 a gallon, which is why I’m interested in your Behr paint. We don’t use it for trim work because of the cost, only cabinets.

slaying occurred in Baldwin County not far from Foley High School,

Cost of living is good compared to many college towns. Birmingham is close by for anything you don’t find here. The campus is beautiful, particularly in the Spring and Fall, both of which last about two weeks. Summer makes up about 70 percent of the year and most of it is oppressively hot. In late July through most of September, it is combined with humidity, the likes of which you cannot begin to imagine until you experience it. 
But what I like most is there’s just a good vibe through most of the university. There is a rich, and abiding, diversity of people. There is a good, positive energy here despite the fact that the university has been increasingly successful over the past decade in rapid growth fueled by more than half of its student body coming from out of state. There is a strong contingent from the Midwest, but also many from California, Texas and the Northeast. You’d think with the campus evolving the past 10 years there would be a good chance for a culture clash. Instead you’ve got a funky melting pot with a strong Southern undercurrent. 
It’s been a few years but the tornado that destroyed much of the town in 2011, did a great deal to unite the community.

“The secret massacre of over 30,000 supporters of the People's Mojahedin of Iran/Mojahedin e-Khalq (PMOI/MEK) in the latter half of 1988, stands out as one of the worst crimes against humanity of the late 20th century. Startling as these figures are, they are only a fraction of the estimated 120,000 political prisoners executed so far during the clerical dictatorship in Iran, often with the direct involvement of Soleimani.”

Soleimani wasn’t just directly and indirectly responsible for the deaths of Americans, but thousands around the world.

He was “one of the most notorious criminals in Iranian history, who had the blood of hundreds of thousands of the people in Iran and the region,” according to Alireza Jafarzadeh, deputy director of the US office of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI-US).

Soleimani’s legacy will include his kill record from the Middle East to South America.

In Lebanon, Soleimani was suspected of being involved in the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, according to a 2013 article in the New Yorker, which reported that the senior investigator for the UN-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon suspected Iranian involvement in the murder."

Soleimani helped save Assad from his inevitable downfall with no less than 80,000 fighting forces under Quds force’s command and by using brutal tactics and destroying the towns and villages and massacring the civilians.

During the 2019 unrest in Iraq, Soleimani visited Baghdad several times and led the repressive forces in that country to suppress the protests. The repressive forces adopted a new deadly tactic: snipers targeting protest leaders from rooftops during demonstrations. These snipers shot most of the 450 protesters killed during the protests. 

Hell, that’s just his work in the past year or so.

news,fe4ymzx,t1_fe4xdmm,1578864046.0,Soleimani was as much a terrorist as bin Laden. He doesn’t deserve the title “general”.  At least half of Iran is happy he’s no longer there to terrorize his own countrymen. He’s done more to destabilize the region than any other person. His list of atrocities are incredible and well documented.

Can’t stand Trump. I pray every night that he is removed from office and will work hard in my little corner to see it happen but on this he gets a pass. Soleimani did enough to warrant it. It should have happened decades ago."

I’m also not a Republican, but I don’t give a damn if there were one or 20 threats and I don’t care how imminent they were. Soleimani wasn’t I. Iraq meeting with bad actors because he was working for peace in the region. 
I am glad Trump called for the strike. My question is why didn’t six administrations do it before he had the chance. Soleimani did enough over the past four decades to warrant such a strike and Iraq, Iran, the rest of Middle East and the world are a better place without him in it. 
And while Trump’s inabilities to handle the aftermath might just lead to more war and bloodshed, that strike alone won’t cause it."

CFB,fdoin2n,t1_fdofui1,1578605908.0,"WTF? You really expect a journalist to withhold news from the public because of the timing of a player transferring? 
First, if the journalist just learned of the lawsuit, no matter how he/she discovered it, the journalist has a job to do and an obligation to report it. Not only that, now would be the perfect time because the player is already in the news. 
Do you think journalists should decide to withhold pertinent information from the public for the convenience of the subjects in a news story?"
