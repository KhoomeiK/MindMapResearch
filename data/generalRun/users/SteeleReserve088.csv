Showerthoughts,femhns6,t3_epqwlf,1579256050.0,"This is a continuation of the shower thought from the other day that stated that adulthood is saying, ""fuck this"" but doing it anyway. You do that enough that you eventually do say, ""fuck it"" and decide not go to work because you're mentally exhausted from the bullshit. Then when you're ACTUALLY sick...can't take off. Either you have no leave or you have an important task to complete or your boss is a bitch and it will, ""look bad"" if you don't come in even if you have leave and your boss's FACEBOOK FRIEND who works with her gets to take off whenever the fuck she wants....

Fuck, I'm glad it's Friday."
Cooking,fedx4ef,t1_fedvdti,1579021745.0,A+ on the follow-through. Love a good food experiment.
Cooking,fed2niu,t3_eoejoa,1578995704.0,"Be the change you want to see in the world. Try that shit and report on the results por favor. Sounds heinous, but intriguing..."
Cooking,fed2iqv,t1_fed2djc,1578995504.0,Duke's ftw.
Cooking,fed2gm4,t1_feczu2n,1578995414.0,"For most I agree that those pre-cut/pre-packaged fruits/veggies are a waste, but I recall reading in one thread how a woman with a physical disability enjoyed getting to buy them because it allowed her to cook when she otherwise wouldn't have been able to (her movements were often very unsteady I believe).

That's really the only true purpose I can see them having."
videos,fe89hv4,t3_eo1vom,1578923959.0,Thanks to this woman I know that AIDS denialism exists. She's a fucking idiot.
norfolk,fdx9gny,t1_fdlp8sd,1578766614.0,Gonna 2nd that recommendation. I've been going to this practice for a couple of years. They almost always run on time and I never feel pressured to spend money on items/procedures I don't need.
Cooking,fdqrsrk,t3_emqvi6,1578673499.0,"I use 3 methods:

-ventilation (which you've already done)

-a small electric HEPA filter (bought on amazon) that I run for awhile in any room that happens to smell off

-Febreze plug-in in the kitchen

Works pretty well for me. Good luck!"
aww,fdngehx,t1_fdn24wc,1578585249.0,Relax. I'm just happy for someone. The post was wholesome.
aww,fdmv6m9,t1_fdms1kp,1578567327.0,"Hey, it isn't bragging if you're spitting FACTS. Lol Good for you. It's nice to hear when someone's life is going well."
gardening,fdkwrr6,t1_fdkvqa6,1578512759.0,Ok. Good to know.

Cooking,fdgczr1,t1_fdg33s8,1578390822.0,The manufactured drama is why I can't stand most American cooking competition shows though. I'll take a show like Great British Bake-Off over a show like Cake Wars any day.
aww,fd66lpm,t1_fd5vl49,1578186269.0,"I can see that. I have a shiba but we lucked out. She's independent like the one in the vid but not whiny (in public). She got 4 shots and a temperature check at her last vet visit and barely flinched.

Made me borderline irritated because she's a brat at home lol"
aww,fd3716j,t3_ejw2qj,1578155291.0,"Typical shiba. Clearly excited to see its owner but not totally going spastic and when the pup decides to actually approach the owner, the pup wants to get in HER face while recoiling when she tries to pet it. Love, on the shiba's terms.

Adorable brats, all of them."
xxfitness,fcttxa9,t3_einwk9,1577959335.0,"I'm doing it! Many people choose to do, ""sober October"" but dry January makes more sense to me (just coming from all of the heavy holiday food/drinking). Good to get a fresh start."
AmItheAsshole,fclvv4r,t3_ehnz5p,1577757726.0,NTA! I work for the government in a blue collar field and we have no less than FOUR grown adults who stink badly and make others miserable. It's better that he finds out from someone that loves him instead of via an intervention with HR at a job.
xxfitness,fclvekm,t3_ehsekf,1577757406.0,"Ok. I have zero fitness advice. Just wanted to say that I read your post and expected an American football linebacker. You are not that, and you in fact have an amazing shape! Best of luck to you."
EatCheapAndHealthy,fc9zusl,t3_egkfw8,1577560697.0,"Here's a general rundown:

Don't buy:

-meats (overpriced)

-most produce (iffy quality/often overpriced)

-dairy, excluding cheese (can usually find milk, eggs, etc. cheaper elsewhere)

-toiletries/paper products

Buy:

-spices/dried herbs (surprisingly cheap-staples and interesting blends such as Everything Bagel and Umami seasoning)

-frozen foods/meal shortcuts (the infamous cauliflower gnocchi among other things are good quality)

-condiments/sauces (hummus, garlic dip and spread, zhoug, various hot sauces, tomato-less corn salsa, etc).

-cheeses! (Some aren't the cheapest for what they are but they have a great selection)"
AmItheAsshole,fc5k2yl,t1_fc523wy,1577459733.0,"One related note: the UC system is currently looking to do away with SAT/ACT score acceptance entirely, the main reason being that it isn't necessarily an accurate measure of intellect as it is of wealth. People that are able to pay more for intensive prep tend to do much better. The UC system is a powerful one and if they do away with these scores I can definitely see it having a ripple effect."
norfolk,fc2wsbx,t1_fc18byv,1577376112.0,Third. And because it isn't in downtown it isn't ridiculously expensive.
food,fc0li6r,t3_efgdm9,1577293786.0,Very good. Are those pistachios? I love pistachios in baklava.

TrueOffMyChest,fbvjpqi,t3_eekq7s,1577131787.0,"Racism against whites and sexism against men are unfortunately minimized at times. I think the minimization stems from the fact that minorities and women sometimes don't feel heard when we bring up issues that have and continue to happen to us though.

 It's getting better, but we're still sometimes met with, ""whataboutism"" or a statement that boils down to, ""Things have improved some so you can't complain"" when we speak up about being denied an opportunity and/or the respect that whites and white men often receive by default. It's wrong whenever anyone faces racism or sexism. ANYONE. These things happen to women and minorities far more often though. These prejudices are deeply ingrained in our social and economic system. In an ideal world we would eliminate all sexism and racism right now but there are too many angles to tackle at once. For that reason, the focus has been on handling the instances that are the most prevalent. Eliminating racism against minorities and sexism against women would reduce the instances of racism and sexism against whites and white men as well. Less bitterness from women and minorities because we finally feel equal and heard means less ill-will overall toward white men. It's a cycle.

If you can, try to resist the urge to be defensive when a woman or person of color brings up obstacles they face due to their sex or race and just LISTEN. Not to sound like Yoda here, but interactions like this are what will end inequality."
