AskReddit,feqavel,t1_feq3t6n,1579339576.0,"how very open-minded of you.  A father is never honored with parental rights and they are only ever imposed because they are supposed to ""be a man"".  The last I checked, she has to open her legs for it to happen too.

So what choice does a man have when the woman bearing his child wants an abortion and he want's the child?

This shouldn't be such a hotly debated topic IMO.  If a woman has a choice, a man should have a choice as well; **this** is equality.  If you want to impose 18 years of support on a man, then it should be legal for a man to impose 9 months of pregnancy wanted or not.  Alternatively if a woman can abort, a man can abandon.  It's one or the other, not both though."
AskReddit,fepvzkx,t1_feptd9w,1579333290.0,"I see what you're saying, but to revoke the option from millions of others who are victimized and abused I feel is wrong.  Doubly so when you have done it multiple times regardless of the reasons.

I love my mother and we have a good relationship, but I don't agree with her on this stance.

On the other side of the abortion coin, I also think that if a father wants nothing to do with their child *before birth* and the mother does then he should have the opportunity to declare himself as persona non grata and thus remove any and all social and financial obligations.  I personally wouldn't ever do that, but there are times when the man is a victim and want's nothing to do with the mother/child."

I just don't get it as a man, if you are so stricken with guilt over it why did you do it so many times??
