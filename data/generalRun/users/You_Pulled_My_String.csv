TwoXChromosomes,fe1v7q3,t3_engvr7,1578831200.0,"I'm sorry.  My ex was the exact same.  He would mentally and emotionally abuse me, and gaslight me as well.  The silent treatment, the physical abuse, the sexual abuse... then acting like nothing happened, and didn't understand why I was upset.  His friends didn't know him to be ""that guy"".  He was a different person with them.  His family knew he was abusive, but were too scared to stand up to him, or report it.  His kids (teens) lived their lives walking on eggshells, afraid to piss off their Dad.  It was horrible.  I was sick of pretending everything was good, and sick of kissing his ass to keep the peace.  First opportunity I got, I got my daughter and I out of there.  I felt bad for leaving his kids, as I was there for 2 yrs.  They knew how their Dad was because he had been like that their whole lives.  I just didn't see it until I was in too deep.  Haven't had contact with him since I left this past Thanksgiving.  I've checked on the kids, though.  They're staying with their Mom.  Please ... Just go no contact.  My ex has sold a lie to his friends and family that I was just a POS and left them alone on Thanksgiving.  He left out the real story.  I figure they'll all see the truth on their own.  Leave your ex alone.  Don't even give him a second thought.  Let him lie.  Those that believe him will see the truth for themselves one day."

Assistance,fdxh3ip,t3_enbb3s,1578768649.0,I would love to receive them!  I left most of my clothes behind when my daughter and I fled my abusive relationship around Thanksgiving.  I only brought what would fit in a small rolling case.
sanantonio,fdxeo0l,t1_fdxatce,1578768025.0,I'll have to check that out!  Thanks!  I was hoping others would post their own stories of visiting those places.

relationship_advice,fd35mbh,t3_ejrb64,1578154948.0,"Hi.  I'm just jumping on here to say that you're doing an awesome job!  I have a 12 yr old daughter, and her Dad is estranged (his choice).  As Moms, we want to make it better.  We want to take away the pain.  That's how we're wired.  I've learned that I can't make up for her dad's missteps.  We can't fix everything.  In my case, she knows Mom is always here, and always has her back.  It sucks, and breaks my heart, but sometimes I just have to be there to pick up the pieces.  Slowly but surely her eyes are opening.  My advice to you is just BE THERE.  Be consistent.  Be the shoulder she can cry on.  Don't sugarcoat shit.  Kids are smart.  She will see the BS sooner or later.  ðŸ’–"
