relationship_advice,ffc9rwn,t3_esp9p1,1579794775.0,"It's not nescessarily ""normal"" (I mean that in terms of the definition of normal being what the majority of the population do) but I wouldn't go as far as to say its weird or unhealthy, humans are naturally social creatures who can become unwell without social interaction but you are having social interaction with your dog so your covered in that aspect. 

My concern with that is that unfortunately our furry friends have significantly shorter lifespans than us meaning at some point you will have to deal with their passing and at that point without a basic support network you may find yourself spiralling into unhealthy behaviour, particularly if you find it difficult to bring yourself to buy another furry friend which many of us do for a time following a loss. Have you considered making friends online? If you find direct social interaction difficult having online friends can give you some time to consider your answers and your responses in interactions, as immediate responses in things such as threads like these arnt nescessarily required. Perhaps search out rooms for people with similar hobbies to yourself?"

I've had countless cases where at fault drivers have had heart attacks at the wheel, a couple of aneurisms, even a few where the driver had a coughing/sneezing fit and veered off course.... These are all things that can happen to anyone so by your reasoning nobody should be on the road.

AmItheAsshole,fcnh6xl,t1_fcne35f,1577811630.0,"I have a full fridge, freezer and cupboards in the house, they have requested a treat supplementary to the standard once a week takeaway I already allow them, I can afford treats and they have them frequently but as I already had a preplanned meal but they have requested a change to something different and more expensive I asked if he should contribute. Get off your high horse and read the full thing as I have already stated I am buying it. They get £50 a month pocket money off me and have numerous treats frequently so don't assume I cannot afford a child. If anything they are extremely well off and spoilt expecially in comparison to many of their peers and that was partially my thinking in that they should learn some of the value of money. I have however had it pointed out to me that their meals are not the way to go about this and in the future I will not ask them to contribute to meals, I will however ask them to contribute to things such as name brand clothes if they want them (whatever is surplus to the generic brands I buy them, don't go assuming I'm not clothing them now either as they both have 5 draws full of clothes plus a wardrobe each) or if they want a particularly expensive toy"

I think as most people have said your wife is clearly exhibiting symptoms of ppd, the uber controlling behaviour she is showing is a classic symptom. You arnt helping though enabling her and with regards to ur shower and laundry why don't u just put the baby in a bouncer or a playpen in the bathroom/laundry room?
