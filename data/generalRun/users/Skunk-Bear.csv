Yes, because society gives them money for merely existing where in the US you would be expected to work. I imagine many who choose to be homeless would just be welfare recipients in Norway.

That said here giving someone a government paid for house they can live in while still being mentally ill and out of treatment, or still being a drug addict isn't really seen as a solution.

Taking a drug addict and giving them a place to live does result in less homelessness, but it doesn't do -anything- to help with the addiction, and it doesn't help the person get to a place where they can take care of themselves. 

Its like saying my program to mail hungry people sandwiches was a great success in solving hunger. Well it might have, for the moment, but it didn't do anything to solve the root problems. 

Also lots of people abandon that kind of housing because as you can imaging nobody wants to live in a place full of addicts and the mentally ill who don't take care of the place they live.

>How do you help someone step out of their comfort zone if you never push them out of their comfort zone? Genuinely wondering.

Generally pushing someone doesn't really do anything but make them resent you, you have to try to get them to push themselves more but with a carrot and not a stick. Plus if someone decides to do something themselves they usually have more determination to follow through then when forced into a situation. 

Sometimes you have to accept that someones issue is an issue of self and as a parent you can't really do a lot to help. Maturing tends to be one of those things, some people just take longer to do it regardless of what the parents do. 

If I was in your situation I would give your kid more time to be close to home, like I said he is still really young and has a long time to go spread his wings yet. Plus kids have never been more mature then they are now, I wouldn't say being on your own at 18 -is- normal anymore, most people I know stayed home well into their early twenties and it didn't stifle them at all."
