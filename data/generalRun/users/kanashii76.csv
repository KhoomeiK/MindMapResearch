If you are that interested in an end...well, just end it."
SandersForPresident,ffaoyxj,t3_esatd2,1579741090.0,"Where do these polls come from? I'm for Bernie, but I mean, I've never once in my life seen a poll, on anything related to politics. Like, where do I go to take part?

Edit for spelling"
politics,ff9xlpm,t1_ff9rjii,1579723707.0,"I liked the first half. I don't trust our govt. To A. Honor the ""present"" check. Or B. Not have actors paid to be there to swing those present voters.

Edit: not to mention the whole district system would have to go. Or have them created and measured by the people in them. Otherwise our representation would always be skewed."
politics,ff9r271,t1_ff9d6f6,1579719174.0,"More parties sounds great. The two big parties would continue to use them like they currently do the independent sadly. But still, you'd run into a major roadblock: ""I just don't know/bother/understand politics. I won't vote, or I'll vote for the big red/blue"" and the minority parties wouldn't last long. Gotta fix the American voting apathy first."
politics,ff9bist,t1_ff8s5qu,1579709195.0,"Nope. I want the documentaries. Sadly, they are like to be in his favor though."
politics,ff9bd2n,t1_ff98bzk,1579709093.0,"Yet that's what we're all doing. ""Don't care, just vote Dem"". Don't get me wrong, I'm all for removing Rep as a whole, but there's bad apples in every bunch, and voting blue/red blindly causes this exact situation."
MovieDetails,ff3kc9d,t1_ff3hd52,1579542885.0,"Well thinking on it further, I guess A. They would follow maybe because money, but mostly Anarchy. B. This movie is likely not part of DC, and that MAY....not be ""The Joker"" anyway.

Anyway, I like to take things at face value. Mentally ill guy was in the right place (wrong?) Right time to spark a riot, and he's the catalyst. Beloved? Maybe not. Respected by the crowd in the moment? Absolutely."
MovieDetails,ff36rhz,t1_ff32bo5,1579535027.0,"Yeah but... isn't he ""The Joker""...isn't he supposed to have a following, joker's goons, how does he gather them? Anonymously? I like to think they explain (read: fake girlfriend) the inconsistencies."
YouShouldKnow,feph4j5,t1_fep4or8,1579320356.0,That's what I kinda thought. Thanks!

YouShouldKnow,fep3pw0,t1_fep2ctr,1579311449.0,That...doesn't affect this collection in any way.
YouShouldKnow,fep3n09,t1_feoyfok,1579311397.0,"I've always wondered though. How often do ads actually work? Personally, I never, ever click them. Also, I'm mostly targeted with things I already own, or recently bought. Sometimes it's like, a G-Star ad. I buy clothes from them. Expensive, so rarely. What gets me back to their store is not ad, but a paycheck where I have plenty of free money, and old beat up jeans that need replacing. Am I just not a preferred target, or are they supposed to work in some other subliminal way?"

Advice,feekntx,t1_fedbvyj,1579035683.0,"I was in that boat, and gave up my romantic interest. We're still great friends. It hurts and takes time, but it's for sure possible. Less hurt than trying and failing I'd say."
Advice,feekgl3,t3_eoj7pv,1579035566.0,"I was with mine for years. Both guys. I gave it up, because I'd rather not risk losing such a great friendship. Best case: be with each other, hopefully long term/forever. Worst case: lose friendship. I didn't want to risk it. Besides, he doesn't know I'm bi, and I never got vibes from him."
AskMen,fee6g00,t1_fee1ubt,1579027373.0,"You can be outspoken, party, talk, engage without confidence. At younger ages, people are generally not looking for their life partner. I'm not terribly confident, and I got laid plenty. Just being in the right places, looking clean, well dressed, and chatting. People are horny. All genders."
pokemon,fe9lkfi,t1_fe6qy1z,1578939161.0,"I also liked them. 

I think it was more widely accepted, but those who ""lost"" it, aren't as vocal as the people who are glad it's gone. I miss them. I much prefer those gates to ""Oh noes, this random cow is in the road, guess no one can come this way!"""

politics,fdfagiq,t1_fddsgeh,1578357092.0,"I mean....he kinda does have seemingly Ultimate power right now. Does he represent? No. Did he get it legally? No. Does he have the power? Absolutely. Can the repubs pass/do anything they want right now? Yes. 

Like it or not, he's our president. And the world is going to hate us probably for many years. More than usual."
politics,fdfa52n,t1_fde8nr0,1578356877.0,"There we go pointing fingers at the past. Make sure to follow those fingers, and don't look at what's going on now. 

Seriously. The past 6 months has been nothing but repubs going ""BUT YOU DEMONCRATS DID SUCH BAD THINGSNEVERMINDWHATWE'REDOINGNOW"" It's not a free pass."
politics,fdf9lur,t1_fdeotvb,1578356516.0,"While I agree that the leadership is most likely directly co trolled by the US, I do t think it's accurate to say we want to torture everyone. Basically Iraq is a staging ground, and a proving ground for our chest thumping idiot orangutan president. America seems to be in a silent civil war, and trust me, 50%+ of Americans are pretty appalled at what has happened recently."

StardewValley,fcnty24,t1_fcnmwk5,1577818353.0,"You can do three rows of that setup, with a scarecrow on the right and left of the center sprinkler line, and cover all the crops there. They cover 8 across, and 4 in either direction up and down from that center line. Save vertically."
