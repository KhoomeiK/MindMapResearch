edmproduction,ffdooj5,t1_ffdify8,1579825361.0,"Just a quick correction - it's not that Girl Talk is transformative, it's just justified outside of court as transformative. Copyright law traditionally calls what he's doing as derivative work, which does require clearance. iTunes and other services quit selling his albums because of legal implications for distribution. 

I read that he hasn't been sued because it is so on the fence that there is a risk of a precedent-setting judgment, and a chance of bad publicity for the original rights holders. But it's a risk I wouldn't recommend anyone taking by thinking he's a good example of how to handle samples in commercial releases."
edmproduction,ffdnjfc,t3_et0mpz,1579824663.0,"While I'm not a lawyer, I did work with some for a national corp for years on copyright/fair use issues. In my experience, none of this could be successfully argued in court as fair use. 

A fair use argument is based on four factors: 

1. The purpose and character of your use. You are not fundamentally transforming the original samples - they are still recognizable as original. You aren't creating a parody, or anything for scholarship, research or education. This wouldn't work. 
2. The nature of the copyrighted work. There is no public benefit to dissemination of these samples, and they are not sourced from factual works - these are all proprietary sounds owned by their creator. Nothing here. 
3. Amount and substantiality taken. Sounds like you used full samples. Less is more when fair use is decided, and using the full sample pretty much negates this as an option.
4. Effect of use upon potential market. This one craps all over any hope of using a fair use defense. The samples are recognizable - you even named the track after a line from the series. It could be so easily argued that anyone hearing this could infer a relationship to the brand that it totally kills any chance of a fair use claim.

Spotify's rules say not to release a track on their service if samples haven't been cleared. Not sure about other platforms. The truth of it all is that you are not likely to get in serious trouble if you do release this, as most copyright-infringing releases happen under the radar. But you're dealing with a really big company with really good lawyers on their side, so if you do get caught it could cost you. If I were you I wouldn't take the risk, but I'm really conservative about stuff like this because I've seen what can happen to people who are busted."

The final map should be completely filled in by submissions, so the original paths wouldn't have room (unless one of the codes happens to align with them, which is possible). As these are slotted in, they are seeing a series of doorways that'll guide them through and believe the ones with empty centers will be ignored - only the ones with symbols will guide them. Based on their process, they're thinking this map will be complete tonight, so we should know where all this is leading pretty soon.
