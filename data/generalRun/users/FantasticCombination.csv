On the flip side I try to be extra accommodating for people doing free: offer to pick it up or meet at a public place convenient for them, let them know it's fine to give it to someone else if I can't get it in their timeline, ask if I need to bring a second person to help lifting heavy objects, etc. I almost always offer to be the back up person if someone else no-shows. I've gotten some great things that way."

I thought other foods were causing the issue, but when I heard from my brother about his avocado issue things started clicking. I can eat more than I had thought at that point. Corn was the other confounding food. So many replacements were with corn. Tortilla chips with guac used to be a favorite. So was popcorn with olive oil, spices, and nutritional yeast."

breastfeeding,fdzwl7d,t3_e99zd8,1578797547.0,"I was looking for better freezer storage options for number 2 and your post popped up in the search. I'm a dad, but mom sometimes travels for work. Like you, she usually works from home. With our first, I would travel to meet her on longer trips. Pumping never worked quite as well for her as a suckling little one would. After about 2 days things would start slowing down a bit for her. Three wasn't usually much of a problem. Four or more and I would hop on a plane with the little one. With a reasonably flexible schedule, I could grab cheap flights. She could sometimes step out between meetings otherwise nursing overnight was enough to help them both. For short trips she had a Yeti-like cooler with ice packs. 

She'd only book at hotels with freezers or refrigerators in the room. More than once she arrived and the refrigerator want moved in to the room yet. A couple times she had problems and needed to ask hotels to store milk elsewhere. She told her travel agent. They threatened to not book moms/her organization at those hotels again until the issues got resolved. She got upgraded to suites with refrigerators a few times. Her organization's travel agent was an awesome asset.

Know TSA regs: frozen is usually easier than fresh; though not required, keeping fresh to containers less than 100mls avoided issues; you can go over the total liquids limit. Check your airports for nursing mother's rooms. They were helpful when she pumped while traveling. If you haven't gotten a pump through insurance yet, check if your doctor can write a note that you travel in order to request a battery powered pump be covered. Many have a policy to make exceptions when asked. Then you're not beholden to an outlet. 

If you have a lot of supply, pump and dump can make sense. A business dinner with a couple glasses of wine-dump. Cooler is getting close to full-dump. Do what works for you and your little one. As a dad, I was always happy to be able to give bottles of breast milk. Mom usually leaned toward having more than enough and brought back the majority of it. She said she didn't feel bad when she did though."
breastfeeding,fdyylab,t3_el1rd1,1578784842.0,"I was searching for better freezer storage methods when I came across your post. Hopefully you are doing well a few days later. I'm a dad, but my partner had mastitis with our first. We dipped heavily into the freezer stash for that and for another time she got sick. Both times her supply came back. We speculated that it may have taken a little longer due to supplementing with the freezer stash. Mastitis was the quicker return to normal production. She usually produces a lot, so that may have affected her experience."
SAHP,fdnnjl6,t1_fdkuppi,1578589491.0,"My youngest is also two months old. I'm so ready for mom's maternity leave to end. I feel like there's an extra kid at home. She wants to do the things I normally do which is great in theory, but in practice the communication is lacking. This leads to things being horribly inefficient. For example this morning, I got to the next own on my to do list and spent a while trying to figure out why the password for an account was not working. She has changed it so she could do the task without telling me. She has forgotten the password because I normally do it. 

Our toddler knows mom will give in to crying more easily, so he's crying to mom quite often when she's around. The few times when mom hasn't been there, he's been fine and listens well for his age. She'll get so mad at him for things that could have been avoided. I have to separate them (gently-usually with a book for the toddler) once they get to a point. Hopefully my encouragement of outside support for what I suspect is PPD will lead to that. If not, that getting back to professional work will take the edge off things."

I apologized for giving her the wrong impression: oh, I'm sorry that I gave the wrong impression; this is my little one. Slightly passive aggressive.

Parenting,fd23r17,t1_fd0wioq,1578141218.0,"My parents straight up told me, as the oldest, that, 'We tried so hard to have you.' It didn't take much of a, if any, leap to know what that means. Not only that but apparently they tried everything they could for years.

One example is that I know I've left the coupons on the table to cut out, but they get tidied so things don't look cluttered. I just don't know where they go and we miss it on a minor amount of savings because I don't want to look all over for them. I want to let a pan soak so it's 20 seconds work now and 10 seconds when I'm cleaning something else at the sink later rather than 90 seconds scrubbing now. I usually say thank you and that I had planned to do it. It's not uncommon for me to look for something for a few minutes and then ask if it had been around only to be told, ""Oh, I threw that away."" I put my jacket on the back of the chair, because I know it's easier to grab one handed than trying to wrangle a toddler to the closet before going out. Talking about the minor things really can help."

Parenting,fcvu704,t1_fcvh5j6,1578010197.0,"My partner has been fortunate. She could probably feed half the village's kids with what she produces. Her dad left the freezer door cracked open last night and she lost about 40oz that she had captured (not pumped) since Sunday afternoon when we got here. The rest of it was below some frozen things in the back and is still safe. We talked about how fortunate she was and how a couple of our friends would have cried at losing that amount of milk. She was like, ""Eh, it's annoying, but I'll make more."" She won't pump for this one until she travels for work. With the first, she had well over 600oz at one point. It came in handy when she got sick and couldn't really nurse for a week and it took a little bit of time for her production to come back. Right now she's producing an extra 15-30oz a day and our freezer is about to burst. If it's like the first, ur will meet demand as number 2 gets to be a few months older. We just bought a deep freeze in part to keep the milk. I love being able to give a bottle and not worry about it too much about how much is left."

Mine also includes two hours/day if you stay on site. Two health clubs in my area have daycare option, but their membership is very high.

This will save you a lot of digging and makes this a relatively straight forward DIY project. Having the drain pipes underground helps the yard to look nicer and lets you direct where the water goes."
