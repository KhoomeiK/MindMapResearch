Until recently (last year) she still partially blamed herself thinking that if she wasn’t good enough for her own father to not kill himself how could she be good enough for anybody else. Don’t kill yourself your gonna miss out on so much of not only your life but of your own kid and even if the only reason to stay alive is for your kid that a pretty damn good reason.

You help bring him into this world you have a responsibility to raise and protect him. If you killed yourself you would end up leaving your kid in the same position your in if not wanting to be alive."

He said “some people are addicted to their emotions they feel the need to feel a certain way because that’s what their use to even if they know it’s not the best or the healthiest way, and sometimes the hardest part isn’t being happy it’s breaking your addiction to sadness”"

depression,fdtmwhj,t3_en2ppj,1578719082.0,"I know what that’s like my whole life has been that way to the point that my family doesn’t even want me around that much the thing is you gotta learn to be happy bye your self and that’s a lot easier said then done

I spend a lot of time alone and it can get to me but I’ve learned that being by yourself isn’t necessarily a bad thing because it’s about what you do with that time and how you choose to improve yourself I’m not saying don’t try to make friends but your never gonna truly be happy in any type of relationship if your not happy with yourself 

For me I work on cars and I started playing guitar I’m not to good with guitar but when I feel lonely it does help"
