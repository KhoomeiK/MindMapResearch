The US government sensibly decided to name different components of their armed forces (their army) different things. Confusingly they labelled one of the components of their armed forces as ""Army"". That doesn't change the fact that in the English language as commonly spoken ""Army"" is a valid label for the entire armed forces as a whole. It just means that it was a poor choice of name.

Here are some sources to back the claims in my first paragraph up:

Let's pretend it's the same as a 10% flat tax, it's close enough for the math below even though that's not quite right.

If I'm making $x per year, then I pay $x / 10 in taxes. Let's say the average person makes $y per year. Then the tax as a whole collects $y * number of people / 10, so the basic income can be set at a value of $y / 10 (minus a few dollars of administrative costs - but they're minimal since giving a fixed check to everyone is *much* easier than most of what we do with taxes).

If I make less than the average person, $x / 10 is less than $y / 10. So this tax isn't costing me anything, it's literally giving me money.

If I make the same (approximately) as the average person, $x / 10 is (approximately) equal to $y / 10, it's a wash, I lose as much as I gain.

A *borrow* is a noun used to label the information that you currently have a valid reference, the borrow disappears when `x` is allowed to act as if that reference no longer exists. For example, the comments in the following piece of code would be correct:

    let x = 3;
    let z = 4;
    {
        let mut y = &x; 
        // y is a reference to x.

            // there is now a borrow on z.
            // There is no live reference to x
            // The borrow on x *might* be temporarily gone, depending
            //      on whether or not the compilers control flow analysis
            //      understands that in this location in the control flow x can't
            //      be borrowed.

        // Let's assume condition was true, then:
        // y is a reference to z

        //       since the compiler can't be sure there
        //       isn't a reference to either of them
    }
    // There are no references or borrows left, they are all gone.

law,feudtzt,t1_fetxyz0,1579385614.0,"You need to distinguish ""damage the landing gear in a way that costs some money to repair"" and ""damage the landing gear in a way that impacts safety"".

Someone above posted [this pdf](https://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/articles/qtr_3_07/AERO_Q307_article3.pdf) from boeing, which states

> landing overweight and fuel jettisoning are both considered safe procedures

and goes into some detail. For instance, on the landing gear in particular, which you claim it could damage, they state

> overweight landings are safe because of the conservatism required in the design of transport category airplanes by Far part 25.Far criteria require that landing gear design be based on:
>
> - a sink rate of 10 feet per second at the maximum design landing weight; and
> - a sink rate of 6 feet per second at the maximum design takeoff weight.
>
> Typical sink rates at touchdown are on the order of 2 to 3 feet per second, and even a “hard” landing rarely exceeds 6 feet per second. additionally, the landing loads are based on the worst possible landing attitudes resulting in high loading on individual gear. the 747-400 provides an excellent example. The 747-400 body gear, which are the most aft main gear, are designed to a 12-degree nose-up body attitude condition. In essence, the body gear can absorb the entire landing load. The wing gear criteria are similarly stringent: 8 degrees roll at 0 degrees pitch. Other models are also capable of landing at maximum design takeoff weight, even in unfavorable attitudes at sink rates up to 6 feet per second. This is amply demonstrated during certification testing, when many landings are performed within 1 percent of maximum design takeoff weight. 

I would like to stress that this says not only should it work according to the design, but during certification testing they test landing at takeoff weight many times."

Now, foobar might be a *pointer* to something else. For example `let foobar = &x`. `foobar` is on the stack since it's a variable, `x` is *also* on the stack since it's a variable. So `foobar` is a pointer, that lives on the stack, and points to someting on the stack.

Another way to get a pointer would be `let foobar = std::alloc::alloc(...)`. `foobar` is still a variable, it still lives on the stack. But it's a pointer, and the thing it points to happens to be on the heap.

A more common way to get a pointer would be `let foobar = String::new(""stuff"")`, in this case `foobar`, like all variables, is on the stack, but it's a struct that looks something like `struct String { data: *mut u8, len: usize, capacity: usize }`. And that `data` pointer it contains points to something on the heap.

There is no hard rule as to what structures contain a pointer to something on the heap. You can look at their implementations to be sure, and often guess without looking. The biggest rule is thumb that things that contains a variable and unbounded amount of data (e.g. `Vec`, `HashMap`, etc) must store that data on the heap since you can only allocate a fixed amount of stack memory at a time."

Actix's speed wasn't due to unsoundness, no undefined behavior was being exploited in the benchmark.

I don't think Actix was actually fundamentally faster than any other framework either. It just happened to get some new optimizations first (mainly relating to async db requests if I understand it correctly), I would expect those to come to other frameworks, not just in the rust world but to all the fast languages.

Everything surrounding the rust project already lives in one country or another and has to obey that countries laws. The foundation would just be one more thing in some country or another and obeying that countries laws. For example, Mozilla today could presumably not hire Iranian coders to work on Rust, and the Rust Foundation tomorrow would also not be able to."

Starlink,fdiyl8n,t1_fdhph52,1578454019.0,"That's... not how latency works.

For every ms of latency, the data you are sending needs to live somewhere in the network for that ms. Travel time even in the initial constellation is going to be in the 10s of ms (up (2ms), down  (2ms) to a ground station at an internet exchange, into the traditional network (1 ms to your closest cloudlare POP)). No one wants to store your data on their device instead of re transmitting it. Storing data for any significant amount of time increases costs, increases latency, and turns out to not actually help much at all with throughput.

To get 150ms you'd have to do something truly amazing like ping back and forth between ground stations and satellites like 40 times instead of just entering the traditional terrestrial internet at one of the ground stations you hit."

I'm less confident that it won't sand blast the bottom and ruin any finish (or paint).
