sidequest,fgbpfpy,t1_ffrfp1s,1580664788.0,"I followed all the instructions, and it slightly worked. 

When I typed in ""adb devices,"" It popped up with ""list of devices attached,"" BUT, there wasn't anything following that. And also I didn't get a prompt on the Quest. 

So, maybe it is the connection. But, it isn't at the same time. I tried every port I have on my computer, ever USB-C cable I have, and nothing worked. 

I'm not sure what is happening, but I hope you know. 
Thank you."
