confidence,ffjgt4j,t3_etttjk,1579997933.0,I'm the same but just go out there... I have lived soo much regret not doing this and not doing that. Take every opportunity to go to a social event. Didn't talk to anyone? Get em' next time. Wow you said hi! next time take it a step further... It will take time and i'm still in the process myself.

depression,ffill5x,t1_ffgv6u2,1579976793.0,"I put my trust into someone and it fell apart. Back to being a loner with no one to express my true feelings to. Im occupied in learning languages and trying to get back into studying for classes. But other than that, i dont care about living. Crossing the street, commuting, crossing a bridge... thoughts of suicide linger and i get massive headaches from my depression and sadness.... wish i can sleep forever"

depression_help,ffgm7rt,t3_etgih2,1579909485.0,Bruh ive been breaking down lately... All i want to do at night is not go home. I want to go out and meet people or talk to someone one on one about everything that ive been feeling but it can be an emotional burden for someone. All i say is that im fine even when im not.

KindVoice,ffbtl0m,t3_esr65b,1579782261.0,"Ramble on... im in the same boat. Im far from family, spend most of the time studying, but also not getting the results that i expect.

socialskills,ff4t8du,t1_ff4qzey,1579571885.0,"If she ever thought you were creepy i would guess she would have changed her route unless that is the ONLY way to her destination.

Try to say it confidently and casually. Rooting for you bud!"
socialskills,ff2vq8o,t3_erbqes,1579525993.0,Idk.. have you smiled at her? if she smiles back i guess its a good sign that she doesnt find you creepy. But if she turns you down take that as a small victory since you tried talking to her.
socialskills,ff2vchn,t3_er9x8e,1579525595.0,my recent had the usual greetings but i never got a long message. it was very thoughtful from her and made me emotional that someone would go out of there way to do so. one day you will find someone that appreciates your birthday. ut for me right now i never loved my birthday.
