science,ffu5z6h,t1_fftq51z,1580235205.0,"Socialization alone bumps life expectancy. Depression is unhealthy. Petting a dog has apparently been linked to lowered blood pressure, decreasing the risk of stroke and heart attack. Also, the responsibility for another life motivates better life decisions. As a previous commentor said, ""have dog, can't die.""

More than walking, pet dogs give you a reason to wake up in the morning. Force you to get up and go outside. It's been incredible for my mental health, personally.

The study doesn't differentiate between people who walk their dogs and those who don't because it isn't the propose of the study, and arguably doesn't matter and and would be difficult to validate with false reporting etc because just owning a dog increases life expectancy - there are studies that show that taking a walk every day does that too, but owning a dog does it for a variety of reasons

Walking increases life expectancy more, actually:
