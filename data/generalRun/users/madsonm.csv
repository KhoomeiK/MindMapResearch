shield,ff6f6n5,t1_ff49w0b,1579625871.0,"> Is a baseball the fastest thing that can be thrown? Is a super soldier like Ruby bound by the existing limits of unenhanced pitchers?

First, Ruby was not a super soldier at the time.  Trained, yes.  Powered, no.  And speed differences between shaped items thrown by a human hand would be comparable.  Especially if we are talking sub-second measurements.  Quadruple it if you want, it makes little difference.

> superhuman who has deliberately been working to lower her heart rate

I was being generous.  Assuming the can maintain low adult heart rate in a battle situation is pretty giving.  She isn't meditating in a room all alone.  Especially because...

> knowing she'd be distracted by helping Mack

...she wasn't being cool and calm at the time.  You can't have it both ways.

>  poor awareness of her surroundings and/or poor reaction time is actually consistent with Yo-Yo's character as we have seen it

And again, back to my point.  That isn't consistent with Yo-Yo who sometimes has advanced awareness.  Can take out an entire cartel, can't stop a bat from entering someone's mouth.  Can disarm a squad of armed men, can't see a blade floating in the air.  In this particular instance she was so single minded in saving Mac she ignored every danger going on around her.  Inept.  

> She got shot during the use of her powers once

Speed of a bullet, around 2,500ft per second.  Speed of Ruby's throw: 1.5 feet per second.  Yeah, it is impossible."
shield,ff4409h,t1_ff3ed3b,1579555047.0,"The theory that she doesn't reverse her original path opens up a plethora of new problems to explain.  What happens if Yo-Yo circles wide around corners?  Will she snap back hitting the edge of the corner?  If she simply moves to the other side of a person?  Will her snap back obliterate their bodies?  Any number of situations could make your snap back theory result in her murdering herself by going to the wrong place.

Regardless, lets look at the math.  The fastest baseball ever thrown is around 105 mph.  The low end of a resting heartbeat is 60 bpm.  Using those very generous numbers the blade would move 1.5 feet in the time Yo-Yo uses her power.  So essentially, the argument that she got her arms cut off while in motion has no basis (learned something new).  Ignoring that glaring issue, Yo-Yo moves much farther than 1.5 feet.  So the speed differences mean Yo-Yo should have plenty of time to handle the blade while in motion as from her perspective it would be slowly floating through the air.

So if we ignore that it is impossible for Yo-Yo's arms to be cut off during the use of her powers (running to Mac or snapping back) it still can't be explained without calling her inept in the moment.  Going from a bullet dodging ghost taking down a cartel to rarely using her powers and mostly failing if she does.  So inconsistent."
