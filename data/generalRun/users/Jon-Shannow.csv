I look forward to 40k becoming more mainstream, as it's a universe which deserves the spotlight. I believe that it can and will be done in a way that attracts new fans and keep us older ones happy.

Happily, it's already begun, and its best to grow with it instead of being bitter about it. Don't gatekeep. If your greatest concern is that there will be an influx of new fans that will ""bitch and moan"" , you have probably been a part of very sheltered groups. Also calling inclusivety bullshit, subtly or otherwise, is not helping your case. Just because things are added and/or highlighted for a new group to join us, doesn't mean they are going to start taking things from you. The 40k universe is big enough for everyone."

ChoosingBeggars,ff80ops,t1_ff78usm,1579662939.0,"If they are incompetent, they are wilfully so. Most of our politicians are swindlers and fanatics, and they make sure that those who work under them are the same. It is easy to get a government job IF you have the right connections to the aforementioned vermin. I have known brilliant government employees but these were the ones who had to work for it, and go through rigorous interviews to get through. They mostly end up quitting pretty fast once they realise exactly what they are working for. The ones who stay do so because they have no choice, and need to feed their families. I even know some who are staying because they want to change the country for the better, but the obstacles they face seem truly impossible to surmount for me.

It's hard for me to speak for the entirety of India as we are a country only in name. In reality each state is divided by language, culture and in some cases outright hostility. But, I can say that the country is mainly held back by ""tradition"" and thugs who keep winning elections by pandering to the same."

ChoosingBeggars,ff2ig3f,t1_ff2h3uy,1579507549.0,"1. Indecent people, whether they are scammers or perverts, by definition do not care much about other people, let alone their country. So it's a given that these are the ones you are going to hear about, as they don't care how they look like and what it says about their country.

2. While I can believe you have seen a lot of said content, I am a bit more sceptical on whether all of them were actually by ""Indian people"". A lot of those are fake, and not actually Indians at all. I saw this first hand during college abroad and I've heard more of it from people I trust. Again, I am not saying all of it is fake, but some definitely are.

3. You know India as one country, but for those of us here it may as well be 28. Each state is completely different in terms of culture and even language. Hell, some states themselves have multiple languages. Don't get me started on dialects. It is weird for me when people make assumptions like you did, when you don't even realise the diversity we have. I am South Indian. I don't speak Hindi. I probably will be as out of place as you if I ever went north. In fact they might treat you better actually.

4. Honestly I could go on and on about this, and perhaps never make a difference. I'd like to try and explain the caste system, and how even the Indian film industry is to blame along with politicians that I wouldn't piss on if they were on fire, but I don't think it will ever matter when all it takes is one post like the above and another ""Bobs and vagene"" joke to dehumanize the lot of us.
 You know what's funny? I don't even like my country. I am not patriotic and I won't ever be. I don't even recognise collective responsibility. I behave according to my principles and would like to be judged as an individual instead of an ""Indian"". I just get angry when I realise these type of generalisations are not only aimed at me but also my family and friends who don't deserve this. Sorry for the rant. You do you."

The Sword of Sacrilege has never made an appearance since then, which could mean any number of things, beginning with the possibility that it was destroyed before reaching the warp. Also the Fists eventually defeated the fleet and only then found his hand, so are you telling me the hand was just floating in space? There IS a possibility that he is in the warp but it is by no means more valid than any other theory considering the information at hand (pun not intended). Everything after his fight on the bridge and the recovery of his hand is speculation by fans, unlike with the rest of the loyalists who were actually sighted, were heading to or lost at the locations (I say this loosely as the webway and warp are immense) we now believe them to be.
