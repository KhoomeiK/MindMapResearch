I tried to stop kratom first and couldnt so I figured if i could at least stop smoking itd be a start. Was trying to take cbd to help me sleep as I'd rather take cbd then thc. It's like a part of a sleep aid it has like some melatonin, cbd and  a couple of some leaf extracts to help sleep.
And when I'm not smoking everything is super gross so it's super hard to eat without feeling nausea, so I'm trying to drink protein shakes and light meals throughout the day instead of big meals."

I've literally imagined myself sneaking in there to read up on some ancient knowledge hah, #Goals
It's so frustrating when I hear news on ""Ancient artifacts uncovered were a hoax"" uhgggg! That just makes me question everything more hah.
I was thinking of a theory the other day about what if were just another Alien experiment that was left behind unsupervised and now that weve been rediscovered and they might just be seeing how it goes.
Like thinking about all the good humanity is capable of but also all the messed up things we do. Why are we capable of such amazing feats but also mess up so badly.
It just feels like this was suppose to be an ideal world but somehow it failed along the way and now were just trying to see where shit goes.
Isnt that what the bible basically says at the beginning? Adam and Eve messed up so now they're just seeing where shit goes right? Could literally be interpreted any way as long as it gets the point across.
Did you hear about stars that disappear randomly and scientists think aliens could be just using Dyson spheres. 
Its scary to think how much more advanced another being could be and what kind of control they have.
I just wish there was more access to findings without restriction out of fear of ""chaos"" of aliens were proven real or something. My dad is a Jehovas Witness and he believes in aliens.
Just let the damn public research as well dammit."

I was actually trying to scare you hah I was kind of intrigued by your question so I tried to find some of your comment history for clues,
Only saw 1 comment on what would be something scary aliens would tell us, 
So I just went based off your answer of ""they're already here"".

Damn! I had it pictured in my mind perfectly too, was hoping it was alien related for the ultimate scare hah.

About your theory tho I've been so obsessed before about previous history not recorded. History is super boring for me, unless it's something not previously found. That's why I really want a metal detector.
