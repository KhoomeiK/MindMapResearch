rccars,ffbzttl,t3_esms98,1579787862.0,"The simplest way to fix that sudden drop is to move the pivot point inward with a simple ramp between the ramps so weight starts shifting earlier. A separate winch for the vehicle would also help, but now I'm getting deeper into your wallet. Without spending a damned dime, you could just secure your load better and move it near the end of the ramp.

With a high power servo, some knowledge of levers, and some links and borrowed pivot points from a mini or full size Revo, you could get sued by Traxxas and have full control of the ramp. 

Edit for full tilt!"

 You could try a tank of high octane fuel to see if that helps. Keep in mind the high octane fuel isn't a fix, but a bandaid. If it goes away with high octane fuel, it's pinging, and the cause needs to be addressed."
MechanicAdvice,fel6hj9,t3_epol2g,1579215094.0,"Like WARGEAR said,  it sounds like pop corn is being popped in your engine. You would feel clutch charter in the pedal by riding the clutch fork and fucking the throw out bearing for a few seconds. 

Based on age alone, I would guess carbon build up, failing EGR, bad valve guide seals/rings (see carbon build up), wrong plugs. Could also be the timing chain/tensioner, or, a hydraulic lift/cam failure, but it's only happening under acceleration. 

I would inspect the plugs & check for a tune-up and go from there. An electric stethoscope is the best way to pinpoint noises."
