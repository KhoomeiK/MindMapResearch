GLOVE LADY. this woman would come into the store within an hour of us opening, and wander around. all. day. She would pull me away from  3 or 4 tasks I was trying to get done at the same time to ask 2 or 3 questions about a door, or a cabinet, and then hmm and haw for 15 to 20 goddamn minutes before asking another question and repeating the process. She never touched anything without gloves on (hence the nickname) and would meticulously clean anything she bought before putting it in her messy ass car. Again, nothing on the mentally nerfed, but this woman bought half a dozen cabinet doors. She finally decides to buy these 15 minutes after we close. THEN she proceeds to carry them out, one by one to her car. which takes a while, because she spends whole, actual minutes wiping down every aspect of these things before putting them in her car. ONE BY ONE. we were there over an hour after close, and I literally began answering all my adorable volunteer's casual questions with answers involving homicide and missing work because of jail time. (imagine a very soft-spoken boy asking his boss what he's doing after work, and getting the gruff reply ""Burying this woman's body."" then soft spoken boy nervously laughing and asking if he'll be needed the next day; ""yes, because I will be in jail for murder."" I got a kick out of it. She actually walked in with me mid-threat and I turned it into something about looking forward to mac n cheese mid-word. something like ""I'm gonna kill- *door opens* lllllllLOVE my dad's mac n cheese. He puts bacon in it with real cheese, and I am so looking forward to it."" Was a total blast. I think she might have heard me though, because we didnt see her in for about 6 months after that, yet she never mentioned anything or acted differently. 

GRANDMA GOD. This little old asian lady would always try to use her old lady sweetness to get discounts and such. Admittedly the store I worked was christian-based, but it was pretty much an afterthought at that point. Charity is Charity, and doesnt really need religious affiliation. but this woman was NUTS. she would call, ask for me specifically because I have a hard time being rude without some kind of justification. she meant well, i think, but this woman was painful to deal with. we are talking phone conversations about god, the longest of which lasted over an hour. There were times she admittedly did need help, but these were similarly long calls, and did i mention I was the manager, often trying to do literally 4 or 5 thing at once? I did not have time for these chats. especially when I don't hate religion, but I wouldn't say I'm a fan. I basically taught her how to renovate her kitchen over the phone. Perhaps she was lonely, but....i just couldn't spare the time. Eventually I had to actively hide from her when she came in, and screened her calls. When the store ultimately shut down (the landlord had a dispute with the companies prior CEO), Anne was still calling once or twice a month looking to preach to me, get a builder's education, or try and get discounts. 

now for some..POSITIVES!

TEA TIME. We had a customer that would bring in authentic tea of some sort. I can never remember what kind of tea it was, but I think he was indian, so if that helps? what kinda tea y'all drink? anyway, it was always amazing. He'd bring in this big thermos, and pour whoever wanted some a cup of tea in teacups he'd bring from home. Then He'd shop around for a while, and pour himelf a cup for the way out. that guy was a legend; I do hope he's doing well. 

THE SPECIAL. So our labour was quite literally an average of 40-70% of our workforce on a daily basis. Once a week, we'd get a lovely English volunteer in (accent and everything, very posh seeming but amusing and down to earth. early 60's, but this woman was north of 6 feet in height. (around 2 metres) and she looked after a gentleman with Down Syndrome that also volunteered who was an absolute delight. always cheerful, always down to give out one of the best hugs in town, and actually super helpful in the store. One day a guy made a nasty comment to the woman (I wasn't present on that day, so this is secondhand and im missing exact details) she would normally handle herself and rip into people that deserved it, but her ward went. OFF. on the guy. ""YOU DONT TALK TO DIANE THAT WAY! THATS RUDE!"" and though non-confrontational, after others stepped in and dealt with dickcheese, they had to leave for the day because the Ward just couldn't calm down after that. needless to say, they became even more popular :) little sad i missed it, but...also not. I am very protective, and giving the staff and volunteers free reign to clap-back when customers step out of line was mostly in an effort to keep it from escalating to the point where I would get involved. I never had to physically remove anyone, but I was more than willing to do so. Also, it's good for morale and customers loved it. 

this is a huge post....there are more stories, but everything stated is completely true, and as accurate as I can remember. y'know, just in case thats ever convinced anyone, ever. there were more fun things about the job, but being responsible for a lot of them tends to just seem like bragging, and that makes me uncomfortable at a certain point. for example, I requisitioned an office and furnished it with a couch, heater, fluffy carpet, and blackout curtains. We had an official Nap Room - frequently used. because god damn it, i wanted a nap room. My cashier used it more than I did, though...and now im uncomfortable, so I'll actually stop. people suck, but jobs can be pretty good, too."
AskReddit,ff5g46t,t3_ergjyj,1579591367.0,"I used to work at a charity retail store (items were donated to us, and we vetted and resold the donations for charity.) there were a few TYPES of people, I wasn't lucky enough to have solely individuals piss me off. some things to note:

-Every item was priced according to half the retail of the item, and scaled down from there with drops in quality or condition. 

-I used to do crazy deals when we were overloaded with stuff and people showed me good shopper qualities. I once held a sale day where Customers could pay $2 and I would flip their toonie; if they called it, they got an item for free.....well, ""free."" $2. three people walked out of our store that day with those swiss vanity mirrors that usually run hundreds of dollars for 2 bucks. so just to give you an idea of how flexible we were - we also really cared for our customers, and had a large number of regulars that often brought us snacks...and you'd think they were after discounts, but these customers often paid MORE. ""you're a charity!"" they'd say. 

SO, ONWARD:

-Customers asking for FURTHR discounts; usually with some garbage about ""only needing this one part"", or ""this isnt what i need but it will do"", or ""this didnt cost you anything anyway."" dude, I don't care if you're taking it to space, I would rather throw it out than sell it to you for the essentially nothing I'm asking for it. 
SPECIFICALLY: We got an african-made hand-carved elephant. One of our volunteers had experience in that area, and valued it at around $200 value; so we'd probably sk $100 since it was mint. Well, one of my inexperienced volunteers acidentally priced it for $20 and put it out. Dude comes sidling up to me at cash (I was a manager, but being in the office was boring) and places this elephant on the counter and my heart hits the floor as my volunteer tells me he priced it when i ask where the customer found it. Well....easy come, easy go, right? I would never stop a sale unless i had suspicion they sticker swapped, and he hadn't. NOPE. motherfucker goes ""would you take $4 for it?"" oh HELL yes. ""No."" right to his beady little eyes, and he shrugs and leaves. phew. I wound up buying it for $50 and giving it to a roomie as a gift. (they loved it) 

-The Price Swappers. We used generic stickers and sharpie tags, so occasionally some genius would try to pull a fast one. The biggest problem was that I knew the price of everything (and what everything did, which were the talents that landed me the gig in the first place) so when this woman approaches my cashier with an obvious sticker swap, I called her out on it. She was really angry about it until I informed her I had priced the actual item that tag came from not 10 minutes prior, and then proceeded to remove the tag to reveal the sticker underneath. cue excuses, and a hasty exit. every. time. now i gotta go back over and put the tag back on the dresser it's supposed to be on. this is a charity. 

-Thieves. Admittedly, the store layout had always been makeshift and security was often sparse. Our best defenses were our regulars and volunteers shopping on their days off. I will never forget the man I caught stuffing his backpack thinking no one could see him. I was working on a platform above him (installing a display and putting a fat unicorn on it because I got to design it, and I knew no one could remove it once the machine was returned) and friendo turned to ICE once I coughed and he looked up. dude SPRINTS out of the store without his backpack. We sold it for $4 to a regular, which they then filled with legitimate purchases. 

-The lack of customers that can read. I got to watch a man MOVE A SIGN OUT OF THE WAY to look through product that we had just received, had nowhere to store in the back, and had cordoned off with signs to that effect stating they were to be processed and were not yet for sale. I am standing at my counter, three feet away from this idiot watching in saddened disbelief. THEN he turns around to me and asks about the pricing, complaining that nothing was priced. I couldnt even speak, So i just pointed to the sign he had moved out of the way. after finally deciding that day was a reading day, he left out of embarrassment. 

-Rude Customers. No specific noteworthy person. people would whistle or clap their hands to get our attention if we were busy, and I instructed my staff and volunteers to absolutely ignore these people. being whistled at like a dog to get my attention is a 0-100 kinda thing for me. customers that would straight-up refuse to accept help from a female volunteer/staff member. (these people often didn't get served.)  (more below!)"

mildlyinfuriating,ff2cp37,t3_eq5tyt,1579500886.0,"when renting a house, bring a small toolkit that you can prepare pretty cheap thatll save you tons of time and perhaps a bit of headache:

-Bring a screwdriver; both flathead and other popular bits: if there are panels or other stuck bits like the electrical panel, you want to get in there and take a look. 

-Bring a small Building Square - i'd suggest a ""Speed square"", just an aluminium or plastic triangle with a 90 degree angle about the length of your hand that will be able to tell you how square and straight the walls are. this isnt terribly important, but sometimes a crooked wall is an illusion, and sometimes it;s a *really* crooked wall. You want to know the reasons behind this - old house? careless builders? sucks to move a shelf into a corner just to learn now you've gotta get something to fill this gap with. 

-A Socket Tester. especially relevant for this post; this little device is basically a plug with an led on it. plug it in, and if the led comes on, the outlet has power. 

-Ask to see the water heater and furnace; for the water heater you want to look for signs of leaks on the ground, and look over the pipe joins. you're just looking for general water damage here; or signs of leaks. they could be indicative of a poor water heater, or that there may be rot or mold problems hiding somewhere if there is lots of water staining present. at the very least, this is important to ask about if stains are present. 

Bring a Flashlight. you will be looking into some dark nooks and crannies. i wouldnt suggest relying on your phone, as in these areas that could be quite a risk. 

For the furnace, see if they can turn it on right whn you enter, just for a little, so you can check for smells. later. ask to see the filters and check the floor vents, if any, just to check how well the place has been maintained. Poor maintenance can bite you down the line, in more serious ways than just finance. 

-Take special care around kitchens and bathrooms, and use your flashlight to check under the sink and whatnot, as these are common mold hiding places. be especially wary if these areas are older material but have fresh paint. 

im really tired and getting distracted; my toolbox is turning into a checklist....  well, tools like that can help guarantee your safety, health, and whatever financial investment you may be making.

I also recommend you do this (and take pictures, specifically) even if you are renting. Especially if you are renting. The goal of rental properties is to bring new people in as quickly as possible once the old ones leave, and this means missed or purposefully omitted problems that already exist could be made your responsibility later."

a) that's a lot of effort, easily undone. 

b) roomie could walk in on her pouring from the jug, and the jig is up. 

c) if roomie is purposefully taking, and mom i still feeding milk to daughter, where is it coming from? then situation escalates unpredictably as she either now knows about it and nothing is solved, or she thinks mom is an awful parent and....well, the situation probably escalates. 

d) constantly incoming and outgoing milk jugs that are always expired in the fridge would be found out after a point. 

the short duration she needs to tolerate this is not worth any of the risk or effort. best bet is to make the milk less convenient to access (bonus pts for putting it behind roomies expired milk so shed have to move it), reinforce asking roomie not to consume food that isn't hers, or just saying nothing and enduring it."

wow,ff29z8o,t1_ferf3n3,1579498221.0,"ill treat it as a serious inquiry: the rest of the structure wouldn't need to change. you would in theory get a single quest per day/faction/whatever that you could turn in once you hit a minimum number of mobs, up to a cap of certain mobs wherein you just wouldnt get credit after that cap. 

It would play out like this: You get the daily. ""Slay Demons."" the required number is 5-200, and you get 1 rep per kill for example. You can turn the quest in once you hit 5 kills, or 6, or 75, or at 200 if you wanted. but you only get to hand it in once per day/week. if you have a little time, you can play a little now and a little later, and have the kills add up a bit till you run out of time in your schedule before handing it in, as quests currently work, and those with lots of time can sit down and minmax if they want...but everyone gets what they put into what would be a very flexible system. 

The only issue is the system would have to have a higher minimum threshold for fetch quests as opposed to kill quests, where the only real way to keep it under control would be to have the minimum be just about the current number of required items, so blizz wouldnt have to worry about further pacing adjustments in terms of how long a quest takes to complete minimum. perhaps a slight decrease even, to better allow for those with little time. (and even ""little time to play"" in this game is still an hour or two) 

It might not be a perfect solution, or even a good one, but it does give things to think about.

Additionally, there would be no reason to have to go back to the hub if you do a quest over two days because of RL, unless you intended to min/max, as you could still do half each day and hand it in on the second day for it's max points, and you've saved a little time."

explainlikeimfive,ff28xtp,t1_fesumtl,1579497282.0,"some gut problems really limit the kinds of food i can eat, and there's no way to know if something will cause me pain or discomfort than to just eat something and wait a while to see if i experience symptoms. there are basic guidelines, but they are not completely the same for everyone. it is called Irritable Bowel Syndrome - and giggles aside, it comes with some heavy consequences. what basically happens is that certain specific chemicals in specific foods cause my intestines to react like in an allergy and become inflamed. science currently does not know what causes IBS, and while there are some treatments that can help a bit, there is no cure. about 30% recover for some reason around year 7 or 8, but the rest usually do not. 

The biggest problems the foods to avoid have is that they inflict mind-shattering pain for days at their worst. Especially at the onset, figuring out what you are reacting to was at least for me, a very damaging high-risk mental game. I wound up losing around 30-35 lbs (around 15 kg)  within 3 months, because I would opt to not eat rather than risk the agony. The biggest offenders are Onion and Garlic. you read that right: two of the most common food ingredients throughout the entire world, and foods i personally loved. I cannot eat many foods from my childhood, which i am still coming to terms with as it is an aspect of who we are that one might not think of as being as important as it is. People and cultures center around food, and I get anxiety just from smelling garlic and onion. Christmas, thanksgiving, etc, are events i no longer attend. Outings with friends are tricky, and as you can see how long this explanation is, doing so on the spot is stressful and exasperating. I also became gluten intolerant as wheat and wheat products seem to have a 50/50 chance of going straight through me, and lactose intolerant as well. as a lover of ice cream, that one especially hurt, and sorbets are not an option as many of the fruits i used to love are off limits. lactose free dairy doesnt seem to work, and shaved ice isnt for me, as i am very sensitive to sugar now. on the upside, my skin has cleared up amazingly. Also meats, rice, and potatoes are completely safe, so life isn't all terrible for me. I can eat as much bacon as I want, so long as I don't let it be too greasy. anyway, among other things many people with IBS, as it is termed, are also able to eat cocoa/chocolate/dark chocolate, to some degree. i ate a piece of dark chocolate the size of my pinky finger nail, and that cost me 3 hours of pain before i was lucky enough to need to use the restroom....the next day. that's right - i had no ill effects from it for the first day, and then got hit the next.  

there's a ton more nuance, many more problems, and effects beyond those listed - and while some are worse than others, their omission is mostly because im tired of explaining and you likely havent made it this far, anyway. if you have, thanks! it's morbidly fascinating, i know. I had a coworker who had it (it is not contagious through any known means, just fyi), and i was interested in how such a curse could come about. of course, he was tired of explaining it and i could feel it, so I didn't get much opportunity to pester him about it. Unluckily, i now have all the answers i never knew i didn't want."

The comic goes on to warn that such legislation would be an entity of power; and as all such entities, would be subject to change and abuse over time as the governing bodies change. while it could be viewed as good at the outset, it could wind up catastrophic very easily if someone of the wrong mindset came into control of it. and as you can see by taking a casual glance at world politics, such an eventuality is not hard to imagine. the comic was very well expressed and I am in no way doing it justice, but it went something like:

""It starts with the ones that can't pass the competency tests. for the better, right? well, what about when things start going bad? suddenly, the competency tests are abstract, and approval or denial is subject to the whim of someone? What about when the competency tests become viewed as unnecessary, and you are viewed as unfit because of a missing limb? or a minor birth defect that has no impact on your life that can't be passed down? what about when THAT becomes being unfit because of your skin color, or where you were born? somehow, what started as a bid to reduce 'bad parenting' has turned into someone having complete control over your reproductive rights as a person (something women already have to deal with, i know) but on a massive, absolute scale. That's *dangerous*. 

Of course, it's hypothetical and again, the original comic did a much better job of explaining a much fuller picture of the very real risks involved. my version is just to get the point across, but i realize it also comes off as being very unlikely. The original was much more convincing and detailed about all the very realistic steps that would happen from eliminating 'bad parents' to becoming essentially god over a population. all in a bid to eliminate behaviours that just can't be prevented with any sort of test."

No, being homeschooled does not mean you will wind up socially awkward and with other social issues. However a large portion - at least the entire point of this sub as i understand it, and so it's population - will be predisposed to being negatively impacted by homeschooling when it comes to social interaction. 

the sub is a small sample size for the overall population that is/was homeschooled, but by definition it is extremely likely that the overwhelming majority of this sub will have negative experiences.
