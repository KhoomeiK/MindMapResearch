LogitechG,fefoeey,t1_fefnkmx,1579060804.0,"That's really really weird.. Seeing more people comment the same thing in this post as well. All of Logitech's advertising images for the keyboards all have the same yellow M keys and white connection + game mode keys. Really no idea what's the difference in boards that allows some people to customise those keys.

Diablo,fef5zsg,t1_feermej,1579048991.0,"You make some really good points, ones that I didn't even think to consider. Thank you for your well written and elaborate reply.

In all honesty, if D4 launches with endgame numbers being in the hundreds (that being damage), I would consider that a HUGE win. I've always felt, in WoW as well, that lower damage numbers were more meaningful, and really gave you a sense of power, over large numbers. When it's lower numbers I find myself focusing on the individual hits more than just an average DPS number."
Diablo,feeow6f,t1_fedwhh8,1579038141.0,"It's funny. Further above it was mentioned that smaller numbers are more difficult to scale, where with bigger numbers it's easier to do gradual increases (from 1 to 2 is a 100% increase, from 100 to 110 is a 10% increase, etc). It seems that the larger numbers have somehow done the exact opposite, and created HUGE gaps regardless."
