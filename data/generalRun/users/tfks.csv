Futurology,fe9fsrb,t1_fe983al,1578937186.0,"> first candidates for asteroid mining are the Near-earth Objects. 

I hadn't considered that, but I have my doubts about how much it improves large scale feasibility compared to conventional mining.   


> processing will happen autonomously 

It still has to happen and still requires energy and other resources.   


> you don't need sustained propulsion 

Yes you do. You need to move these objects. You also need to stop them once they've arrived. The only reason I said sustained is because it simplifies the numbers. If the power expenditure happens all at once at the beginning and end of the trip isn't relevant. The things we fired past the heliosphere had rockets on them. Moreover, I only talked about power requirements and completely ignored how you would convert that power into kinetic energy, because that's not simple either. Rockets are great, but limit you based on how massive you can make the vehicle."
Futurology,fe96kmb,t1_fe8rwhf,1578934836.0,"Using a baseline quantity of 10000kg of material and assuming we want to move it to Earth from the asteroid belt in 2 years,  


Distance to Earth = \~500m km (500x10^(9) m)

Mass = 10000kg

Time = 63x10^(6) s (doubled to account for deceleration)

Velocity = (500x10^(9) m)/(63x10^(6) s) = 7.9x10^(3) m/s

Kinetic energy = 1/2mv^(2) = (1/2)(10000kg)(7.9x10^(3) m/s)^(2) = 312x10^(9) J

1Wh=3600J, so (312x10^(9) J)x(1Wh/3600J) = 86.7x10^(6) Wh

2 years = 17520h, so 86.7x10^(6) Wh/17520h = 49.5x10^(3) W, or about 5kW  


  
So every 10000kg of material would consume a sustained 5kW of power solely for transport before you do any processing whatsoever. That's also ignoring any energy costs associated with other logistics required for an operation that has to move in and out of Earth's gravity.   


Wikipedia says that the world steel production in 2018 was about 1800 Mt. The above calculation was for 10t of material, so let's say 0.5kW per ton. So you're looking at 900 TW of power required for global steel production in terms of transport requirements and nothing else for asteroid belt mining. Even if you met global requirements for every mineral, you'd still be using many, many, *many* times the current global energy output to do it. It's not an infrastructure problem. Even if you increased travel time to 20 years (which would reduce power requirement by a factor of 100), you'd still need 9TW and you'd still be using more energy than total global output."

Even if the plan was to completely withdraw from the Middle East at that point, *something* had to happen to slow down the attacks. The militia that had been firing rockets at Iraqis and Americans all month were at the front door. Obviously something different is happening now, but Iran is looking to consolidate power in Iraq and based on Iranian actions over the past two decades, particularly refusing to cooperate with the IAEA with regards to their nuclear program, that's a bad thing.

To maintain capacity at acceptable levels, an industrial facility would have need 2-3 times their actual load installed, maybe more. They'd also have to manage their loads and generating levels at all times. It's obvious to everyone when the grid is overloaded-- you get brownouts/blackouts and that's bad, but it can be equally bad if there's too much energy available on the grid, with motors spinning too quickly and electrical lines melting. Both are managed constantly. Utilities are trading power all day every day to balance what they're generating with the actual loads. Excess is drawn elsewhere in the grid. An industrial facility could just disconnect their panels/turbines, but then they're sitting there doing nothing-- better to have them grid connected and sending that perfectly usable energy to something.
