Enemies are less bullet spongy and legendaries spawn less often (legendaries are stupid anyway). Makes the combat interesting again.

Infections are terrifying. I had one save where I had no antibiotics, and had to desperately grind for a levelup so I could pick the Chemist perk and craft them. Good shit!"

So if you have 100 armor you take almost the same damage from a 20 damage shot as if you have 1000 armor! This is why automatic weapons are so good. But if you have 1000 armor you can probably survive a rocket or two, which the 100 armor won't help against.

If you steal from someone and get caught they will attack, but if you don't fight back you can usually run to an exit grid and come back later, though if you have companions with you it will always end in genocide. It depends on the victim, some (children) don't get mad over it, and some never forget.

If you don't have lockpick skill, you can kick down or use a crowbar on most doors, as long as your Strength is high (about 7-8 will do). Molotovs also work.

AP ammo is entirely useless without Weapons Redone, avoid it.
