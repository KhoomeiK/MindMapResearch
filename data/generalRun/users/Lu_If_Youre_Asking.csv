aww,fdpltjg,t1_fdpjjji,1578632240.0,"I have a rescue munchkin and a foster fail and my munchkin runs as fast and jumps as high. I do agree though... I had to help rehome a “famous” munchkin (seriously - wtf 1 mil ig followers) ... her owner got bored. Poor girl was so short and hated people. Once she warmed up to you, the cuddliest creature. She found an amazing dad. 

Anyway, some munchkins can and yes some are so messed up from breeding they don’t walk well. :( 

I worry for my boy but “we” take care of him by exercising and making sure his joints are ok.

Hated dogs. H A T E D dogs. Also wasn’t fond of cats, but my foster kitten pushed her way into my girl’s heart & they were best friends."

FemaleDatingStrategy,fcsh2yf,t1_fcrv6bk,1577916441.0,"Not sure this will help at all, or if you'll remember in the moment.... BUT.... I've learned to instinctually ask myself ""how wrong was he?"" / ""what did I learn from that?"" then praise myself for the growth (even for just remembering to ask myself in triggering moments). It's second nature for me now. Now, I dont even ask myself the question, my brain automatically processes to get to the most positive outcome and I move on and it adds a healing point. 

Some things even make me laugh which is tough to explain but stems from memory, for example, the last time I tried to fight for the positive, it probably was either all wrong or just a plain funny positive..

Disclaimer: I never laugh about the abuse, other than the ridiculousness of telling me I'm fat, ugly, unloved, unworthy, crazy, lazy, and all the other lies he told to me that I'M NOT. I AM so confident in myself now that telling me those things are like lying to my face, which makes me laugh.  You're none of the negative things you were told, none of them. AND if you do have one of those qualities and you feel bad because it's TRUE, it's actually true and you want to fix it, FIX IT. Fix it FOR YOU and only you. Fix it because someone pointed out a characteristic you'd like to improve.  There are some positives - that's one of them! Don't change for anyone else, ever. Improve for you."
