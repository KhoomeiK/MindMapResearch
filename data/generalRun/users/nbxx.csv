Put 150 g of oats, 300 ml of water and 2 scoops of whey (whatever flavor works, but I prefer fruity flavors for this, even though I hate those for simple shakes) in a closable bowl, mix it up well, and put it in the fridge. Obviously you can use milk too, but you'll have to play around with the amount to reach the desired thickness. My current favorite combo is strawberry whey and a bunch of fresh blueberries on top, but I also like chocolate whey and roasted unsalted peanuts, or vanillan whey with half a can of pineapples. I didn't use cinnamon for a while, maybe I should pick some up next time I hit the store."
BarbellMedicine,ffc9dfx,t1_ffc7yn8,1579794520.0,"So it's been a while since I've read the article, and I'm not going to read it on my phone right now, but based on what I remember from it and Jordan's stuff in general, when he talks about protein per meal, he usually does not consider rice, oats, nuts, etc protein sources. He usually says if you eat enough protein from quality sources to hit your leucine target in 3-5 meals a day, then the trace proteins from all the other stuff you eat will add up to a higher total protein intake. So basically when he says you should hit let's say 20 g of protein a meal, he doesn't mean you should eat enough chicken and rice to hit 20g of protein, he means you should eat enough chicken to get 20g of protein, and have rice with it, which would end up being more total protein."

See HAES or other fat activism for example. If it's some random person I have a short interaction with asking, I might say something like ""just cut sugar"", but if someone goes out of their way and seek out information directly on a fitness forum, I'd rather give actually useful information that they can build on for the long run.

Fitness,ffbq70i,t1_ffbp8ml,1579778206.0,"Oh boy, there is a lot to unpack here.

First of all, toning is not really a thing. Or rather, it's literally the same as losing weight, which reveals your muscle mass.

If you don't have any appreciable muscle mass, then you'll never have that ""toned"" look.

You can build some muscle and lose weight when you are a complete beginner, but not a significant amount, and you can't keep up doing it for a long time.

If you want to lose weight, then your primary focus should be your diet. That's a whole lot more complex than cutting down sugar. First of all, there is nothing wrong with sugar in itself, if it's in the context of a healthy diet. Secondly, cutting sugar in itself is not necessarily enough to lose weight. If you cut sugar, but end up eating more calories from complex carbs or fats, you won't lose weight and you likely won't improve health markers either. You can increase your calorie needs by doing cardio, but it's a lot easier to not eat 200 calories, than to burn it.

To get a firm, ""toned"" look, you'll have to lose fat AND build muscle. That's when resistance training comes into the picture. One thing to keep in mind is that even while you are dieting, you want to do resistance training to prevent losing muscle mass while in a caloric deficit. That said, after the very early beginner stage, that's all resistance training in a caloric deficit is, preventing losing muscle mass. To build muscle, you'll have to eat at least at maintenance (body recomposition), or even eat more and gain some weight, some of which will be fat, that you can lose later.

As for the ab wheel, yes, it's a great tool to train abs, but it's not an either/or question when it comes to ab wheel and the exercises you mentioned. Do them all.

Honestly, the best thing you could do is to read through the wiki ( [https://thefitness.wiki/](https://thefitness.wiki/) ).

Get a basic understanding of losing fat, gaining muscle, weight fluctuation, nutrition, etc...

Since going to the gym is not an option, your best bet would be to get your nutrition in check and do the /r/bodyweightfitness recommended routine ( [https://old.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended\_routine](https://old.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) ) which is also mentioned in the /r/fitness wiki."

BarbellMedicine,ffbjl56,t1_ffaxlfc,1579768356.0,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure the 15 hours were thrown around here a day or two ago, but the discussion was about Powerlifting II, which is 4 days + 2 days of GPP to begin with, ramps up the volume (or rather, the number of sets) on the big lifts faster than the Hypertrophy and Powerbuilding templates, doesn't use myoreps, the recommended rest time during the third movements goes up from 2-3 minutes (like in the other templates) to 2-4 minutes, the GPP arm work is not supersetted and goes up to 5 sets of biceps and 5 sets of triceps, etc...

So yeah, that's a lot more time consuming template in general. Also, I think commuting to the gym was included in that 15 hours, so it could check out, as I'm doing Powerlifting II right now, and I do end up with 4 sessions that are 2.5-3 hours long each. I do my GPP at the end of my main work, split to 4 sessions and I'm not in a hurry with rest times.

If the former, then yeah, that's fine, but some people can train right after a meal without any issues, so if you didn't do it yet, you should try.

Also, a preworkout meal doesn't have to be something huge. If you can't handle a full meal, then just try eating a banana and a protein bar/shake.

If you absolutely can't eat anything and have a productive workout, then you can also try liquid calories. BCAAs are frequently shit on in this sub, and yes, they are certainly not what they were advertised to be some years ago, but if you can't eat, sipping on some BCAAs intra workout and having some sugary drink (nothing crazy, something like a can of coke) right before training could be fine.

So BMR is only relevant in the sense that you absolutely should not eat less than that (not for extended periods anyway), but it's largely irrelevant (assuming you are not entirely sedentary, literally sitting on the couch all day) when it comes to calculating how much you should eat. For example, as a 5'11, 220 lbs guy, who trains for powerlifting 4 times with 2 relatively short sessions of low impact cardio (30-40 min LISS once and 10-20 minutes of HIIT once) a week, and about 10 000 steps a day on average, my BMR should be somewhere right under 2000 calories, but I usually need to eat about 2500 to lose, 3000 to maintain, and 3500+ to gain weight."

As far as bodybuilding goes, AlphaDestiny was (probably still is, but I never really watched his stuff other than a video or two, so not sure) big on above the knee rack pulls for building huge traps. IIRC Mike Isratel's take on it was that it's not worth the systemic fatigue (since the point is to load more weight on the bar than you could deadlift).

For powerlifting, rack pulls (or block pulls, but the idea behind those is the same) are usually used as either an overload movement for the deadlift or it's used to work on specific weakpoints during the main movement.

Strongmen could use it for the same purpose as powerlifters, but also, elevated deadlifts can be one of the feats at competitions, so rack pulls can be even used as a main movement during a cycle leading up to a competition.

So... programming?

A bunch of movements thrown together are not programs.

Also, exercise and training are two very different things.

A quality template will give you a well thought out plan for 8-12 weeks or even more, manipulating volume, intensity and variation with the whole plan in mind.

The idea behind buying these is not to buy a program that you will run forever, but to get an idea about how an experienced coach would start with a new client of a given level. You run a few of these, pay attention to what works and what isn't specifically for you, and start messing around with them to make them fit you. The problem is, to make successful changes, you have to understand the basics. None of the programs from the wiki will teach you anything about programming, and when you get to the late-intermediate/advanced stage, you will HAVE to figure out what works for you to progress, and you won't be able to do that if you rely on the mostly beginner stuff for free from the wiki.

Would I buy an Athlean-X program? Fuck no, the man is a hack. That said, there are several companies out there who do provide quality templates with lots of free content to back it up. Renaissance Periodization, Reactive Training Systems, Barbell Medicine and Juggernaut Training Systems are all companies I'd gladly support with my money (and did so with some of them), knowing I'll get my money's worth (and you get a lot more if you consume their free content).

Getting some templates from these guys and messing around with them while learning the thoughtprocesses behind them is the same as hiring a coach, but you have to do a lot of the guesswork yourself. You pay a lot less, but it will take a lot more time. You'll learn a lot both about yourself and about programming in the process though. It also has the adventage of the stuff you're getting coming from a trusted source. I'd pay for a template by Mike Tuchscherer over hiring a random coach every single time. Yes, the random coach might be good (chances are they won't be though), but I know Mike T's stuff WILL be good.

Also, if you do long, high volume training sessions (think at least 1.5 hours or more of actually hard work, so not bullshitting with your mates in the gym for a long time), then supplementing BCAAs intra-workout seem to help with recovery. In general, you probably don't need them, but they are not absolutely worthless as many people here seems to think."

If you want to do both, then treat them as separate movements and when you are deloading, deload both accordingly.

If you usually lift with a belt, then you switch to beltess on a deload week, then you apply a different stress that your body is not used to. You might end up not actually helping your recovery to catch up, even though you limited volume for the week.

Also, I never search for anything that is not specific to Hungary in Hungarian. So basically, I use it daily. I make lots of mistakes (especially using he/him instead of she/her, since gendered pronouns are not a thing in Hungarian), but when I read/hear/write English, I don't translate to/from Hungarian in my head, I just think in English, and I achieved that point without formally studying it. I took a few classes in university (1.5-3 hours a week for about 30 weeks total through multiple semesters) to practice actually speaking a bit, because here in Hungary you must have an intermediate or higher level language exam to get your diploma (I think you need 2 now), but by then, I knew enough to don't actually learn anytihing new and just used the classes as practice.

German on the other hand... I studied it in elementary and highschool, for I believe a total of 9 years. In highschool I had something like 7-8 German classes a week. I even had to pass a German exam at the end of highschool (equivalent to the American SAT's I guess), which was marked just below an A, which in turn would have given me an intermediate language exam in German. That was about 10 years ago. Nowadays I don't speak a word in German. Granted, I hated it and I didn't put in any effort outside of sitting in on classes and studying for specific tests.

I don't know why, English just made sense to me and I learned it by trying to communicate in online games, then watching TV series with Hungarian subtitles. Then after a while I got good enough and impatient enough to not wait for Hungarian subtitles to be released and switched to English subtitles. Nowadays I still use english subtitles when watching series/movies, but honestly, I have no idea why, since I listen to plenty of podcasts and watch a fair amount of youtube without any trouble. It's just a habit at this point. I actually prefer English to Hungarian, which, if I didn't learn naturally due to being born here, I wouldn't even touch with a ten foot pole.

Whey frees up some of your calories, so even when you are home, you can probably eat higher amounts of fatty protein sources and still hit your calorie goals.

Also, 1 large egg contains about 6-7 gramms of protein. By eating 3 less eggs WEEKLY, you lose about 20 g of protein a week. Also, 9 eggs a week does not make a diet a high protein one.

Maybe even an entirely different squat variation to limit the absolute intensity. To give you an example of my past 2 days, I did heavy squats and heavy bench yesterday, followed by some high rep OHP, then I did heavy deads, heavy pin bench and high rep tempo (3-0-3) squats today. All of the work was done at at least RPE 7, with the last sets being at RPE 9ish.
