This is a tad misleading, but a complete summary of Occam's razor requires reference to the concept of parsimony and the notion of ""multiplying entities"".

This is true, but misleading. Most major cities around the world have such facilities. China has a ... complicated history with bioresearch, though. To say that they didn't have facilities like this makes it sound like they didn't have facilities to perform such bioresearch previously, and that's not actually true. They just didn't have facilities like this, which was bad. China has specialist hospitals that perform research, but in order to get samples from other nations for study, they needed to have the internationally recognized safety protocols and equipment. That's what this lab is for.

That's not the implication of putting this post here on /r/conspiracy. I get that it's a valid option, but it's not the implication I was responding to. It's also yet another unnecessary introduction of new requirements. For this existing virus to mutate in the animal or human population and then spread in humans is possible without any external agency, intended or not. So there is no reason to introduce this additional agency.

> Extremely weak and tenuous argument

It's not actually an argument. I'm just pointing out that the initial idea that a thing we expected to see playing out exactly as we expected to see it isn't evidence of a new phenomena or some unseen agency. To argue that it is is the weak argument. Saying, ""you haven't demonstrated the need for your claim,"" isn't a weak argument or a strong one, it's just a factual observation in this case.

> it is extremely suspicious that there was a high security biolab studying coronaviruses in the same city in which a coronavirus outbreak occurred

Not at all. We know that China has been a hot-bed of coronavirus mutation in the past because of the high density of people and livestock providing an opportunity for disease to leap back and forth. That the place where this occurs is investigating that phenomenon in that pathogen is obviously expected. It's similarly expected that a future outbreak starts in that nation. The two are correlated, but not (directly) causally linked."
conspiracy,ffbofgr,t1_ffapzjs,1579775649.0,"The existence of the lab does check out, but let's apply a bit of occam's razor, here, shall we?

TL;DR: there is every reason to assume that events as they are currently playing out are what we would expect if no one was orchestrating the current outbreak and researchers have been saying for decades that we'll keep having such pandemic waves, so we don't need to explain the current outbreak using some imagined nefarious plan.

First, some background:

Most major cities in the world have biolabs for studying the most dangerous pathogens. They need to. In the US, these are CDC facilities, and there is probably one not far from you if you are in a major city. They are there because it's essential that, in the case of an outbreak, there be facilities nearby that can isolate and study the pathogen.

Wuhan is the most populous city in central China, according to Wikipedia, so the existence of this facility is surprising only in that it was opened so recently.

It is also important to note the implication being made, here: that there is currently a disease spreading out of China centered on Wuhan and that these two facts are linked.

There is one last bit of background needed: the [coronavirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus) is one of many viruses responsible for what is colloquially called ""the common cold"". It's quite common around the world, but occasionally a new strain becomes problematic, such as the 2002 outbreak of [SARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome).

Okay, enough background: to occam's razor.

The implication requires the injection of an intent-based agency into the facts that we already know (that is, someone deliberately created and disseminated the pathogen). But without the insertion of this new presumption, the current scenario can still play out: like SARS, a new strain of one of the world's most common infectious viruses developed naturally and happens to be both somewhat life-threatening and highly contagious (the ingredients of a pandemic).

So we already need to introduce new assumptions to make the hypothesis work, but we don't need to introduce them: the law of parsimony is an easy guide, here.

But one might argue that it seems awfully suspicious that this disease developed so close to such a facility. It's not. Pathogens mutate frequently, but mutated strains usually die off before they can spread very far. The ones that are preserved tend to be the ones that develop in high population areas. Thus there is a correlation between population density and the origin point of most pandemics. As covered previously, these high containment facilities exist in most large cities, so the places where diseases will tend to originate also tends to be where such facilities will be.

I do think that a ""high value git"" would be useful for projects where it's worth an attacker's time and money to subvert SHA1 (or perhaps even more robust algorithms), but for the average user, the extra time spent validating currently cryptographically secure hashes is a fundamental waste of time, money and energy."

Error handling is always important. The ability to spend large sums of money to trigger an error isn't the important part of that concern.

Also, keep in mind that the specific issue with SHA1 would require that you craft BOTH images, not just one (it's not a brute force attack against an existing hash).

> It's definitely more reliable than whatever you hacked together misusing SHA-1

SHA-1 has been an international standard for decades. It's not a ""hacked together"" anything. Using it for hashing is not ""misusing"" a hashing algorithm, and trivial hashing algorithms that are intended to provide CONFLICTING HASHES are not appropriate for many purposes that more robust hashes are put to.

MD5 and SHA1 are perfectly reasonable hashing algorithms for cases where conflicts are not expected in routine operation. That doesn't mean you don't code defensively, but there's a world of difference between using a hash tree and using hashes for quasi-unique indexes.

There's a difference between ""not easy"" and ""orders of magnitude more work than a simpler attack that is a perquisite anyway.""

My point, which I think stands, is that this was not ""common"". That's what I was responding to. A small fraction of transfusion recipients got the disease, though the fraction went up as high as 50% for some populations (e.g. platelet transfusion recipients) by 1987.

> SHA-1 hardened with counter-cryptanalysis (see ‘how do I detect the attack’) will detect cryptanalytic collision attacks. In that case it adjusts the SHA-1 computation to result in a safe hash.

the internal state differences to a not-too-big subset (as done in [SLdW07, Ste13b]).

This sounds, to me, like they are still crafting a weak target that would be identified by counter-cryptanalysis as above. Am I correct, there? If so, then this is not, as the paper tries to suggest, ""SHA-1 is now fully and practically broken for use in digital signatures,"" just that there are models of signature usage that can no longer be trusted, and most of those involve social engineering that could have resulted in the compromise of private signature tokens at zero computational cost."

Understand that the entire point to introducing SHA1 *was collision resistance*! Just moving to another hash that has yet to be demonstrated to have similar issues doesn't actually address any of the needs of developers.

When I write a piece of code that hashes an image for database indexing, for example, I really do not care about whether an attacker could craft an image that would collide. I just want a good way to determine the right answer in any practical cases. Can you upload an image to my service that will cause problems? With a whole lot of compute and no upper limit on image size, probably, but then your account gets shut down and you're out whatever all that compute cost you and I'm out a button press.

Correct, nor should they have been. And developers who then used it for security purposes got what they should have expected to get: eventually the mismatch between their needs and the needs of a non-security tool diverged.

The US spends more than it has and that's a real problem, but most of its spending is in three areas:

* A military (by which I'm including the military proper and all other international offensive and defensive tools such as intelligence, military R&D, etc.) that is so much larger than any other nation that it could be reduced by an order of magnitude and still be the world's largest military
* Healthcare spending on the world's single least efficient health care system (Obamacare slightly improved the efficiency, but it's still like throwing money into a furnace)
* Debt servicing

If we cut those first two by an order of magnitude (e.g. by reducing military spending across the board and instituting an efficient health care system modeled on any one of the diverse array of proven solutions) then the debt servicing would be hard, but not impossible to deal with.

Radiation includes visible light, ultraviolet and infrared light as well as forms of radiation that we don't usually think of as ""light"" such as gamma-rays, x-rays, microwaves and radio-waves.

So yes, non-ionizing radiation can be harmful in the right amounts and the right wavelengths, but there is no evidence of frequencies being used by 5G have more or less impact than the frequencies being used by other spectrum consumers."

This is a tad misleading, but a complete summary of Occam's razor requires reference to the concept of parsimony and the notion of ""multiplying entities"".

A slightly better summary would be that parsimony should be the guide in evaluating competing hypotheses, given all other decisive factors are equal.

They just didn't have facilities like this, which was bad. China has specialist hospitals that perform research, but in order to get samples from other nations for study, they needed to have the internationally recognized safety protocols and equipment. That's what this lab is for.

> SARS has managed to escape from high security containment multiple times. It is possible that this new virus was created artificially, but that's what these labs do as part of their work.

That's not the implication of putting this post here on /r/conspiracy. I get that it's a valid option, but it's not the implication I was responding to. It's also yet another unnecessary introduction of new requirements. For this existing virus to mutate in the animal or human population and then spread in humans is possible without any external agency, intended or not. So there is no reason to introduce this additional agency.

> Extremely weak and tenuous argument

It's not actually an argument. I'm just pointing out that the initial idea that a thing we expected to see playing out exactly as we expected to see it isn't evidence of a new phenomena or some unseen agency. To argue that it is is the weak argument. Saying, ""you haven't demonstrated the need for your claim,"" isn't a weak argument or a strong one, it's just a factual observation in this case.

> it is extremely suspicious that there was a high security biolab studying coronaviruses in the same city in which a coronavirus outbreak occurred

Not at all. We know that China has been a hot-bed of coronavirus mutation in the past because of the high density of people and livestock providing an opportunity for disease to leap back and forth. That the place where this occurs is investigating that phenomenon in that pathogen is obviously expected. It's similarly expected that a future outbreak starts in that nation. The two are correlated, but not (directly) causally linked."
conspiracy,ffbofgr,t1_ffapzjs,1579775649.0,"The existence of the lab does check out, but let's apply a bit of occam's razor, here, shall we?

TL;DR: there is every reason to assume that events as they are currently playing out are what we would expect if no one was orchestrating the current outbreak and researchers have been saying for decades that we'll keep having such pandemic waves, so we don't need to explain the current outbreak using some imagined nefarious plan.

First, some background:

Most major cities in the world have biolabs for studying the most dangerous pathogens. They need to. In the US, these are CDC facilities, and there is probably one not far from you if you are in a major city. They are there because it's essential that, in the case of an outbreak, there be facilities nearby that can isolate and study the pathogen.

Wuhan is the most populous city in central China, according to Wikipedia, so the existence of this facility is surprising only in that it was opened so recently.

It is also important to note the implication being made, here: that there is currently a disease spreading out of China centered on Wuhan and that these two facts are linked.

There is one last bit of background needed: the [coronavirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus) is one of many viruses responsible for what is colloquially called ""the common cold"". It's quite common around the world, but occasionally a new strain becomes problematic, such as the 2002 outbreak of [SARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome).

Okay, enough background: to occam's razor.

The implication requires the injection of an intent-based agency into the facts that we already know (that is, someone deliberately created and disseminated the pathogen). But without the insertion of this new presumption, the current scenario can still play out: like SARS, a new strain of one of the world's most common infectious viruses developed naturally and happens to be both somewhat life-threatening and highly contagious (the ingredients of a pandemic).

So we already need to introduce new assumptions to make the hypothesis work, but we don't need to introduce them: the law of parsimony is an easy guide, here.

But one might argue that it seems awfully suspicious that this disease developed so close to such a facility. It's not. Pathogens mutate frequently, but mutated strains usually die off before they can spread very far. The ones that are preserved tend to be the ones that develop in high population areas. Thus there is a correlation between population density and the origin point of most pandemics. As covered previously, these high containment facilities exist in most large cities, so the places where diseases will tend to originate also tends to be where such facilities will be.

SHA-1 has been an international standard for decades. It's not a ""hacked together"" anything. Using it for hashing is not ""misusing"" a hashing algorithm, and trivial hashing algorithms that are intended to provide CONFLICTING HASHES are not appropriate for many purposes that more robust hashes are put to.

MD5 and SHA1 are perfectly reasonable hashing algorithms for cases where conflicts are not expected in routine operation. That doesn't mean you don't code defensively, but there's a world of difference between using a hash tree and using hashes for quasi-unique indexes.

* A military (by which I'm including the military proper and all other international offensive and defensive tools such as intelligence, military R&D, etc.) that is so much larger than any other nation that it could be reduced by an order of magnitude and still be the world's largest military
* Healthcare spending on the world's single least efficient health care system (Obamacare slightly improved the efficiency, but it's still like throwing money into a furnace)
* Debt servicing

If we cut those first two by an order of magnitude (e.g. by reducing military spending across the board and instituting an efficient health care system modeled on any one of the diverse array of proven solutions) then the debt servicing would be hard, but not impossible to deal with.

So, that aside, I still disagree with the statement.

If we take ""character"" to mean integrity (that is, the correlation between your aspirational sense of who you are and how you actually behave), then that's certainly a very good start to anything more profound, but on its own it's meaningless. You might view yourself as a deep thinker and sit around thinking deeply every day. But the person who has weaker character but works as an EMT is, I think, meeting a higher standard.

The highest aim is leave the world better than you found it, and that requires that you develop a value metric that is meaningful beyond your own context. That's really hard to get right. Having good character helps you in that process, but it's no more the highest aim than a good set of tires is a cross-country journey."

Right. And can you see the server logs that tell us when he died or are you just basing that assumption on when the UI caught up to the better part of a second lag between server state (shown by when the dialog pops up, give or take network latency) and UI state (shown by when health drops to 0)?

The fact of the matter is that we don't know exactly when the killing blow happened.

You and everyone else, but not everyone agrees, nor should they since it's not actually clear what the cause was (and cannot be, since we don't have server logs). For all we know he died to something that wasn't even rendered.

> People are blind and are somehow attributing it to the frost nova which goes off and he's fine for 1.5 seconds after

Again, you are assuming a sequence of events that may not be valid. His HP does not drop to zero until after some things and it is before some other things, but whether or not that's the correct ordering of those events depends on what the server was doing, what network sync mode he was in (looks like lockstep, and probably is, but impossible to be sure), what the rendering characteristics of those events are (e.g. do you take the nova damage at the start or end of the animation), etc.

> they attribute it to the bird slam which doesn't reach him until after he's dead

That's not really clear to me, even in what we actually see. The bird is in mid-teleport when he goes to zero HP (but the teleport and the change in HP all happen after the popup). I would have to single-frame through another case of that bird attack happening to be sure of when you take that damage, as I recall it happening somewhat early at least.

EDIT:  Note that even the above is an over-simplification. The real sequence of events is:

1. Killing event along with other events happens server-side
2. Killing event is added to lockstep processing queue
3. Death notification is sent asynchronously to client

Sure, but that's the opposite of what I was pointing out. Yes, good food makes you want more good food. Bad food can also make you want more bad food. But the wanting is not an indictment of the food. That clearly refutes your allegations that good sex making you want more good sex somehow makes the sex bad. Yes, you must control your urges for good sex if that good sex is homosexual ***just as you would if it were heterosexual***.

You have failed to make a point in favor of your thesis, however.

That's ... partially true, depending on your definitions and which sects you are referring to, but ***that was not your original claim***. You spoke of sexual liberation, not lack of moderation. One can be sexually liberated (which is to say unconstrained by outdated sexual morality) and still practice sexual moderation. Hell, you can be celibate and sexually liberated.

Please understand that I'm not taking, nor am I interested in a political team, here. I'm just pointing out what's important for humanity to come to terms with about its environment: that it is a massive and complex system with feedback loops and self-reinforcing systems that we simply do not yet understand.

The really difficult question is how many causes are there and what are their long-term systemic properties.

For example, we know that there are at least five major inputs (greenhouse gas concentrations, surface albedo, whatever the hell causes the cycles at order of millions of years, solar output (possibly many sub-cycles, but we know the 11-year one pretty well at this point) and Milankovitch cycles.

Each of these is difficult to measure as a component because the effects are not simple functions like adding up sinusoidal-waves. And the entire system has behaviors that range from well known to just coming to light to utterly mysterious.

For example, it could be that we are increasing greenhouse gas concentrations at precisely the right period of time to destabilize the feedback loop that is currently bringing the ice age to an end (yes, we are technically within an ice age right now), which could amplify the next natural swing to colder temperatures. A deeper ice age is a much more devastating outcome than warmer temperatures. But as soon as people hear that the time-frame for these larger systems is tens or hundreds of thousands of years at a minimum, they usually stop paying attention.

On the other hand, we might be reinforcing the current warming trend in such a way that we will fully exit the current ice age, which would be a good thing except for the potential to over-shoot and the disruption in the medium (thousands of years) term.

This is the difference between thinking about human climate politics and thinking about the climate as a system."
