Wellthatsucks,ff7gvjp,t3_es2hw6,1579649256.0,Qtips and rubbing alcohol.
PoliticalHumor,ff4raow,t1_ff4niyi,1579570552.0,I appreciate the healthy dialog.  I do not advocate gun confiscation and I don't have an issue with law abiding citizens owning firearms but I think stringent qualification should be placed on the ownership of assault weapons. How you define that is difficult. The ownership of a fifty Cal semi auto with a 40 round clip is a stretch of the protection argument for me. We see that a gun like that in the wrong hands can be devastating. Real life examples again and again. That indicates to me that action is required. I do hunt and own numerous firearms but I don't need an AK to feel safe. I think the brandishing of the weapons in the subject photo doesn't send the right message. Thanks again for the dialog.
awfuleverything,ff4mnkc,t1_ff4me7p,1579567311.0,Hell yes!
gratefuldead,ff4kmb3,t1_ff4iqos,1579565896.0,I rad that radness!
phish,ff4izwz,t1_ff4h64v,1579564764.0,Amen me too!!! Pull that witch!
PoliticalHumor,ff4dm58,t1_ff47vvx,1579561109.0,Gun violence in this country is an epidemic. When a group decides to exercise it's rights by touting military firearms designed to kill humans you should expect a visceral reaction. You'll say it's the person pulling the trigger. That requires me to put my faith in the notion that the people in that photo are stable. I will not take that leap.

facepalm,ff1oejk,t1_fev5o6c,1579482606.0,Nope you had to be an eyewitness.
ravens,ff1o1fj,t1_ff1awrd,1579482389.0,Solid anaysis
Tennesseetitans,ff18iuv,t1_ff16f4g,1579476301.0,Ravens fan. I appreciated the smashmouth Henry  machine and wished we would have had a game last week where we would have seen two teams try to run each other into the ground. I was pulling to see you all go the distance. Hats off Titans. Great season.
Tennesseetitans,ff15o87,t1_ff157vc,1579475496.0,For real...second post like that
ravens,ff14dme,t1_ff0wva4,1579475109.0,Shoot with 9 attempts we didn't abandon it we never tried but I hear you.
ravens,ff13ev2,t1_ff0bq9q,1579474800.0, Somebody on the Titans sub hoped that Hill would blow his ACL.  I saw some serious Trash at the game last week. Fuck the Titans.
ravens,ff12kx6,t1_ff0jvgg,1579474611.0,Bingo.
ravens,ff117b7,t1_ff0vikg,1579474238.0, Me neither.

facepalm,ferlj0g,t3_eqgbr4,1579355468.0,But you are still not an eyewitness therefore you are not in the club. Pastor Dumbass has spoken.

ravens,fe5zy8m,t1_fe0acpz,1578878691.0,I'd love to hear Harbs explain the gameplan.
ravens,fe5wvxi,t3_enwg5r,1578876753.0,Damn I didnt know Neal passed. Man this is a rough Sunday. Love Ravens and Rush.
ravens,fe5roby,t1_fe2qikz,1578873609.0,You knew that Harbs would go for the 4th Downs.  He demonstrated no game awareness. We weren't winning on the lines. The offense was struggling. It's the playoffs. Games turn on fewer key plays. I had posted that the 4th down attempts would bite us eventually. I was bummed that it was so dramatic and a big factor in the loss.
ravens,fe4tbbr,t3_enta9r,1578862605.0,Well it appears that we are that team.
ravens,fe0a9sb,t3_eniv4o,1578807561.0,Best run offense runs the ball 9 times. Come on.
ravens,fdxsudi,t3_en90iz,1578772522.0,Just take care of bizness. Bug Truss.

orioles,fdky981,t3_elxuqn,1578513631.0,I'd buy the cheapest and the sit wherever you want.
ravens,fdew3vb,t3_ekmxfk,1578347819.0,Shoot. Just learned that bout Ingram. My bad.
ravens,fdcp1b9,t1_fdcodj6,1578280430.0,Right on. Just gotta believe and enjoy the ride!
Hunting,fdcodhy,t1_fdcmxac,1578279944.0,It's a compliment! That is badass! Well done!
ravens,fdco314,t1_fdcke2g,1578279730.0,And Ingram ain't gunna be too keen on Henry getting more yards than him. I'm expecting straight fire outta Mark Ingram.
ravens,fdcnsc6,t3_ekmxfk,1578279511.0,"Love my Ravens. Big Truss but after watching these games I'm always struck by how mistakes, bad calls, and pressure have a magnified impact in the playoffs.  I mean the Clowney Hit changed the game. Josh Allen's lateral could have gone down as the dumbest play in playoff history. It's ashame that I'm as worried about the refs as I am the Titans. The answer is to smoke em so bad that the zebras can't f up the game. Let's rock this  weekend!"
Hunting,fdclz2u,t3_ekeibt,1578278213.0,Wow. Lifetime membership in the No Fucking Around Club awarded.
eagles,fdcljo9,t1_fdbxajs,1578277903.0,Exactly. Clowney would have been ejected if that were TB 12.
eagles,fdclb6k,t1_fdc3ivp,1578277736.0,No man. Ravens here. That Clowney hit was a penalty. One bad call can penalize a team for the entire game and that is what happened. I'm a football fan and knowing that can happen to any team on any play sucks. You are spot on.
Saints,fdck865,t1_fdcccnq,1578276963.0,Agree. Mistakes like missed field goals and turnovers are magnified in the playoffs.
WookStories,fd6ccbh,t3_e5n4pn,1578188802.0,That's too good!
buffalobills,fd69ngs,t1_fd68wgq,1578187643.0,Very very true
buffalobills,fd69f27,t1_fd695r4,1578187544.0,Agreed that blindside call was horseshit.
buffalobills,fd61m0r,t3_ek2ogw,1578184275.0,Josh has lost his fing mind
PoliticalHumor,fcvy7fb,t3_ej7bri,1578012804.0,I don't get it. Is this because TS and DT are both wealthy?
jambands,fcslq8n,t3_eiohcu,1577919205.0, Sorry about your experience. Sounds like you generally enjoyed most of it. Try to focus on the music. I do understand this was part of the show.
jambands,fcskokd,t3_eiohcu,1577918528.0,"Don't let it dissuade you. The scene generally is about warmth, acceptance, and good vibes. Mix up good music, drugs, booze, and thousands of people and you will get some bad behavior."
jambands,fcskgd9,t3_eiohcu,1577918379.0,Hmmmm....I guess that I'm having difficulty understanding the blurry line but I wasn't there so Im just sorry you find yourself distressed. If the band leader told a raunchy joke would you have been upset?  Serious question.
jambands,fcsiz6r,t3_eiohcu,1577917432.0,"Hard to be ""down"" with raunchy jokes but then get distressed about the subject attempt at humor. You didn't think it was funny but the person next to you thought it was hilarious. Sorry   that you are distressed but it seems that your recourse is to not see that band anymore."
ravens,fclqfv0,t1_fclan3t,1577753964.0,Totally agree!!! It was so remarkably similar. I had lost sight of the results a QB that inspires the team can do! Joe had talent but zero fire.
Hunting,fclo116,t3_ehum9n,1577752311.0,Aw man it happens but you saw some!
trashy,fclje3h,t3_ehteij,1577749166.0,Gotta keep the fur in his throat clean
phish,fclj4rc,t1_fclhjyw,1577748996.0,Nice catch. The Fuzz is among us.
steelers,fcl6cnr,t1_fcinfi1,1577740765.0,"He did. He just beat the Steelers. Nice on the ""fucking retards"" Stay classy Shittsburgh."
steelers,fcktgfn,t1_fcjobu5,1577732821.0,Agreed.  I love the way Steelers fans are upset about the Way they were curbstomped with a 4th ranked defense and the playoffs on the line. Complaining about 1 play. You could have stopped the Ravens and made it 28 to 17 and still lost......decisively.
steelers,fcjxnce,t3_ehe7uu,1577709537.0,"As weird as calling a team that just whipped your ass ""Douchey"". Now that's weird."
steelers,fcj0ddq,t1_fciyxn0,1577674148.0,Well played. Honestly you all did pretty well with a lot of shitty misfortune. I've enjoyed the rivalry over the years and actually survived the AFC Champ game a few years back. The most brutal games I've ever seen have been Ravens Steelers.
ravens,fcizv80,t1_fcinr6d,1577673801.0,"Did the same! Somebody said we ""were so Douchey"" ""Harbaugh was a piece of shit."" I reminded them that our second string douchebags just whipped their first and that Tomlin actually stepped into the field of play during a kickoff. Pretty salty in Pittsburgh land!"
steelers,fcizikk,t1_fcitpjm,1577673563.0,Yeah I think we remembered Tomlin stepping into the field during a kickoff run back. Our second string doucheys just beat your first string with your playoffs on the line.  Didn't like the fake punt? Then stop it.
steelers,fciytqk,t1_fcioyhc,1577673098.0,"Yeah he even stepped on to the field during a kickoff run back. Oh wait, that was Tomlin."
ravens,fcixgw4,t1_fcinxpn,1577672155.0,You should be proud of what you all did with such bad misfortune this season. I don't hate the Steelers as much as I did when Heinz Ward and Porter were there.....but the Patriots....F those guys.
ravens,fcin7tc,t3_eh8czi,1577665398.0,That was some bullshit
ravens,fcij56a,t1_fcihzr0,1577663414.0,I do! Was thinking that
ravens,fciicl1,t1_fcii4y0,1577663035.0,Somebody make a Gif! That was a stone cold Tucker groove.
nfl,fchs2he,t1_fchnisv,1577653542.0,I watched this dynamic for years. Not saying we ever had anybody remotely comparable to TB but any QB will be constrained or thrive depending on the talent around them.
nfl,fchjdf8,t1_fch4o8a,1577651018.0,Ravens fan. I'm not sure Tom has the weapons. I think there are simply more mistakes when a QB has limited options. Not hating just offering an outside opinion.
orioles,fchhrfu,t1_fche1zr,1577650604.0,No prob. They are around.

They are actually not a deer but an elk. They bugle like elk and it adds a whole new experience. Really spooky. Most fun I've had hunting in a long time. Grew up on Whitetail and love it as well.
