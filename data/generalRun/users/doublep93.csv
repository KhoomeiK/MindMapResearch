depression,fgnz5on,t1_fgnyw16,1580956119.0,I think it was about normal time for them to work less time. There was about a year gap inbetween them from last time till now.
Anxiety,fgnyrif,t1_fgny11v,1580955867.0,"Hey, thanks for the reply.

Ive been out of bed and got a glass of water so its a different place and doing something different for a minute or 2 so im not just lying thinking there...

Ive been doing some breathing techniques like that to try calm me down and talking my feelings out loud to myself so I can process them.
Its the main unknown of tomorrow,, its only been 2 weeks but its still stressing me out cus people will ask where ive been.
I have tried to plan tomorrow at work to be less stressful by letting my manager and team leader know ill be back and need work etc, but with this anxious mind im 2nd guessing myself about going back in earlier...

I really need to start therapy again..."
Anxiety,fgnxur8,t1_fgnwsvr,1580955277.0,"I've been talking to myself and saying my feelings out alot so I can try process them better.
What I cant figure out is why im so anxious about it. 2 days ago when I called my manager up to let him know I was coming back, i felt fine. Ive tried to get a job sorted out so i can go straight back to it and try fit back in. Hell, a couple hours ago I felt fine when i got my bike and bag sorted for work so i could have no hassle in the morning but as soon as ive gone to bed
 Boom... mind is racing"
