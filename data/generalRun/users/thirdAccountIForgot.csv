I’ve got a perfectly normal sex drive, but any time I take a minute to think a bit too much I’ve always wondered how evolution didn’t stumble into making genitalia at least a bit more... streamline? Less prone to poor hygiene?  I don’t know, they just seem out of place and gross unless carefully cared for.

Whether or not you want gun control changes, saying a constitutional right can be taken away or modified without due process is a terrifying precedent. If free speech could be limited due to “red flag” issues (and circumventing due process), it would be a massive hit to american democracy. 

The idea of keeping guns out of the hands of mentally ill, etc is great, but not at the cost of circumventing ingrained protections of Americans’ rights. 

The thing to remember is that any power given to the current government will be given to the next after each election, and though you might like the current people in office, they’ll be replaced by someone eventually who may or may not abuse the extra power."
