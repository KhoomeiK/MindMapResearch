I'm waiting for the person you answered to say something like this since it's about the only thing someone could lie to themselves with to justify all the racist shit he's said.3 Or you know, they could just be a racist too and agree with all of it. I'm guessing you'll get crickets for an answer though."

news,fglmekb,t1_fgl538g,1580904309.0,"Two weeks after the radiation levels were actually not bad. There was not much fallout created because it was an airburst, and must of what was created had a very short half life. It all depends on the bomb and the deployment. That is why it is completely safe to live in Hiroshima now yet there are still places in the pacific test grounds that are not. The main radiation that harmed people in the Hiroshima blast was the prompt radiation, the initial huge burst on detonation. This radiation is extremely harmful to people in a certain radius that are caught outside or in structures with thin walls. The prompt radiation does not turn buildings or anything radioactive"

ChoosingBeggars,fg49jf7,t1_fg47yt4,1580499031.0,"Opiate addiction is so much more complicated than that, and this is coming from someone who's been there before. It's hard to explain exactly, but even if you really want to quit there's almost this automated part of your brain that takes over and just keeps you going to get more. Nothing stands in your way. Small dosing does relieve the physical withdrawal symptoms, but it doesn't scratch the itch of the psychological withdrawal. You crave that good feeling, so much more than just a want to not feel sick. Every second you're on a small dose is still torment, even if you feel fine physically. You'll spend your whole day waiting to come across some way to get a larger dose and feel the warm fuzzies again. The small dose keeps this going because occasionally you'll still briefly touch on that feeling and it drives you. Unless you are extremely committed to it the ability to quit is still very far off. This is why people on methadone tend to not just rapidly taper off, even of they've been on it for years. You can overcome the physical symptoms with some fortitude and determination, but even once you've successfully quit you'll never lose that occasional twitch in your head when your brain wants to do it again. I haven't touched the stuff for 10 years and I still feel the draw of it sometimes, it's likely I always will. It's a hell of a bad drug to be addicted to"
