Irelands a wild ride at times, we had a dude in our version of parliament claim drunk driving was less dangerous than driving after eating a large meal. I shit you not."

AmItheAsshole,ffifjjb,t3_etidys,1579972660.0,"YTA. While this is reddit and you'll be told ""your wedding your rules"" in the real world you're gonna be rembered as the bridezilla who picked pretty pictures over her own flesh and blood. Children with ASD have abnormal behaviours and fixations, you knew this before asking him to be part of your wedding. He didn't ask for any of it, and neither did your sister.  You chose a kid with autism to be your ring bearer and now are excluding him because he's acting like a kid with autism. From your telling of it you didn't even try to meet them halfway (like a blazer over the costume) it was your way or the highway.
And for yourself do you want a few pictures of a kid in a cute costume or hundreds of pictures with your family doing fake smiles because they're mad you left josh out?"

AmItheAsshole,fff8v0g,t1_ffencr6,1579878597.0,"It's AITA on reddit, people get pretty polarized on things and the only options are upvote or downvote, so even if someone only partiality disagrees it's still a minus. That sucks man and it's such a normal reaction for ASD. There may not be as many of us as we'd like, but people who understand know you're not doing it on purpose. Hell, I bet no one would like to stop doing it more than you! You're doing your best to function in systems that weren't designed for you, that should earn leniency not annoyance."

We're the biggest consumers of MDMA per capita in Europe, and I think we're closing the gap on coke. Maybe 30% of my nights out at least one person in the group has a bag of white, and I don't even do coke or any hard drugs. Imagine it'd be much higher for other peeps"

Serna Williams has won charity games against men. I have never heard of a professional team getting beaten by teenagers so saying that happens on the regular requires a hell of a lot of proof. If your claim is men have the advantage in contact sports why were both examples non-contact, and who the fuck are you quoting?"

AmItheAsshole,ff2dbdy,t3_er6rqs,1579501532.0,"NTA, red flags a flyin' for your sister. It feels a lot like gas lighting when anyone's first response to ""why lie"" is ""are you fucking spying on me?!"". There's plenty of possible innocent explanations to this, and maybe he is telling the truth, either way you've done your sister a favour by making her see this side of him.

AmItheAsshole,ff29q95,t3_eqzw7z,1579497995.0,"NAH pregnancy is a heelova drug, ya can't predict how anyone will react ahead of time. However, if you are trying to pressure her into an abortion or getting rid of the kid in these arguments then YTA. This has to be her choice at the end of the day because its her who has to have the abortion or the baby, you don't want to be held responsible for any future regrets she may have."

AmItheAsshole,ff27rtz,t3_eqzf0e,1579496265.0,"NAH, Trevor noahs book ""born a crime"" deals with his own issues around accepting his biracial identity really well. He grew up forced into a racial role he felt he didn't fully identify with. He was too white for the black kids and too black for the white kids, eventually he learned to accept both parts of him but not in equal measures. I'd recommend it for your family, reading someone else's struggle may give y'all some perspective or ideas on how to tackle your own.
Good luck."
