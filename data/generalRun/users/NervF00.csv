AskReddit,fb9615y,t3_ebuquu,1576630263.0,"When are you going to grow up? 

I don't think anyone has ever asked me this, but it seems implied, or asked, I'm not really sure. Not really sure why, and I don't know how to grow up. Most of the time, I forget. I am fairly immature. It's this weird feeling I have of being worthless, and at the same time, weak, but no way of compensating, for, a lack of a better word, strength- I guess maturity would have worked. And to say ""I'm trying"" is just an excuse, so steering away from the problem just hoping things change for the better, seems to be the best answer to work with. ""But I'm in denial, I'm lying."""
