StardewValley,ffg862c,t1_fffgpfo,1579900540.0,"Maru works in a doctors office and is a scientist. I assume she’s already been to college. Sebastian implies that he could’ve went to college but chose not to, and he all around feels like an outsider in his town. I remember even Alex called Sebastian weird. Alex and Sam DEFINITELY give “mentally stuck in high school vibes” but I feel like Alex, who although doesn’t directly trash Pelican Town, would love to leave in order to “go pro” as he’s mentioned. 

Haley is a sweetheart when you get to know her better. She was never a city girl as far as I know but she hates the town at first because she aspires for a life that a very rural town can’t give her. But getting to know the farmer has subconsciously made an impression on her. So she appreciates nature and her surroundings more.

Also Harvey gives implications of not wanting to stay in the valley. Not major but like, he struggles to make a living there."

This was last month. I came in for the 7 am shift that same/following day and had to find out this happened through coworkers who read about it on the news. No mention of him by supervisors no RIP or memorial or ANYTHING. Not even one of those papers with his face on it remembering him to put on a cork board or anything. Work proceeded on as normal. It felt so weird working that day while knowing that happened."

And That literally NEVER happened. After Eddie died he was mentioned only a couple times or so max? When did she guilt anyone into giving her attention? That never happened on the show and even if it *did* somehow happen even once, people giving her sympathy over the loss of her fiancÃ© isnâ€™t guilt tripping.

FlashTV,ff3kz4e,t1_ff2lywn,1579543271.0,"I get what youâ€™re saying but tbh I think itâ€™s a mix of both. I remember Iris hate has existed *before* the show officially began and from episode 1, and it only progressed from there.

Now I donâ€™t think this is every haters reason for disliking her, but we canâ€™t pretend it has no part in it either. In this sub alone, and on Twitter, Iâ€™ve seen people admit that they think iris would be better if she was portrayed by someone who â€œlooksâ€ more the part. Iâ€™ve seen people say they wish the actress who played Patty shouldâ€™ve played Iris and vice versa (not talking about the people who still ship him with patty. I mean the people who were explicitly talking about the actors).

It sucks because Candace is great and I think she portrays Iris fine. I donâ€™t think Irisâ€™ writing was always good but I feel like sheâ€™s gotten better this season compared to the last couple and sheâ€™s really coming out with more depth. I feel like people in this sub donâ€™t just dislike, but refuse the idea of growing to like her too."

People can come around to liking all kinds of characters they once hated but yet they literally *look* for reasons to keep disliking her."

Supernatural,feivpk2,t3_epddj3,1579148503.0,"Were kind of in the same boat in that way. I watched the first 9 seasons when they aired. Stopped watching for like 2 or 3 years out of I guess a natural loss of interest (which was odd bc it was actually my favorite show even til the season 9 finale. Not sure what happened that summer between then and s10 but suddenly I just didnâ€™t care anymore) and just got back into it in mid 2018. I watched seasons 10 and 11. I have to pick it back up myself now.

I will say, I wasnâ€™t shocked that Chuck was God. Back in  some of my tumblr days, in about 2013-2014ish, I remember people were calling the shots that he was God and that was when he was known as a mere prophet. That was actually a very popular theory. So when I got back to the show and it was canon, it didnâ€™t surprise me as much.

I had mixed feelings about Mary being back but ya know. What can you do. I agree about s11 though itâ€™s good and Iâ€™d say my favorite Iâ€™ve seen in a while too."
BlackPeopleTwitter,feiu11l,t1_feitgsu,1579147196.0,"I literally just said I didnâ€™t have a phone in high school, which for the record, was a long time ago and Iâ€™m well beyond those teenage years. And with all budding technology there are pros and cons and I feel like the negative way you mean is the incorporation of social media in modern smart phone use. Weâ€™ve had cell phones even in the 90s and early 00s and we still had meaningful connections then too. Though granted, they werenâ€™t as commonly used. My point is that when people blame cellphones they are really blaming this deep engagement with apps and social media that you can carry with you everywhere now. Phones in and of themselves are not fundamentally negative and thatâ€™s why I said one can choose to have a phone without all the extra. At their core they are an extreme convenience no matter how you choose to look at all the rest. 

My comment was also based in how I observe modern teenagers. I donâ€™t know everything but from the outside it looks like they still engage with each other like I did when I was in school. But now thereâ€™s so many more factors added to the mix."

BlackPeopleTwitter,feiot5y,t1_feioif1,1579143532.0,"Iâ€™m a producer on the show. 

No jk. But like I kinda already answered that. I randomly went on your profile (it wasnâ€™t intentional at first but then I saw you used to post in the flash sub). I currently watch the Flash and saw the crossover. And then it resulted in me asking if you seen the crossover considering the cameo that just happened. And well, here we are now."
BlackPeopleTwitter,feioevv,t1_feimbxo,1579143267.0,"Damn. Well Iâ€™m gonna tell you this, the flash fandom agrees overall that this season is the best one since s3. S5 was trash but they got a new show runner for s6 named Eric Wallace and itâ€™s actually good again. and theyâ€™re done with big bads now after the Cicada shitshow. The bad for the first arc (Bloodwork) is already done now weâ€™re on the crisis crossover (tbh even if you donâ€™t get back into the Flash the crossover alone is worth it and the best one yet) then another bad. Theyâ€™re done dragging out big bads like they did with Cicada in s5. 

From first glance things might seem not terribly different but trust me things have improved. In writing, also Flashâ€™s s6 suit is the best looking one heâ€™s had. Itâ€™s not that ugly spandex looking shit he had in 5 but itâ€™s not that god awful leather of past seasons either. Itâ€™s a mesh that looks natural for a speedster. Iris is a legit journalist for her own paper now and sheâ€™s becoming better written. Ralph is also better written. 

The season has its flaws ofc, and the changes may not pop out immediately but once you notice them you notice. but I do think itâ€™s worth it considering the terrible last 2 seasons we were dealt. Iâ€™d say itâ€™s worth coming back to but if nothing else you should at least check out the crossover. Thereâ€™s a major cameo too nobody was anticipating and I love it."

In May 2018 a random guy followed me while asking me all these basic questions. I only answered to be nice. He followed me into a gas station. He asked for my number, I said I didnâ€™t have a phone. He noticed my phone in my back pocket and brought it up. From there he only continued to get creepier. Pressing his body close against me despite being out in public. It got to a point where on the sidewalk, he pulled my arm and started humping against me and jerking and pulling me around and even got me down on the ground at one point. It was horrifying and I kept screaming and crying and it didnâ€™t stop him and none of the cars driving past stopped to help. One guy getting into his car looked at us for a moment, I was hoping heâ€™d step in, but he proceeded on. It was heartbreaking. The guy only backed off because I managed to pull myself up just enough to bang loudly on a nearby store window. Why no one in there heard my screams to begin with, idk but if I hadnâ€™t done that he wouldâ€™ve done worse. He was turned in that same summer and charged with 2 felonies. 

Iâ€™ve said no to guys since then, but on a gamble and in any case itâ€™s ALWAYS scary and unnerving even more for me now, whether or not I do because I have no clue how theyâ€™ll react. I know it probably sucks for the guys who have honest intentions but honestly I donâ€™t feel bad for taking extra precautions now because of what happened and what more couldâ€™ve happened."
