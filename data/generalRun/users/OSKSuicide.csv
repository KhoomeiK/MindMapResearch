Refused to ever release dash cam footage and dropped the evasion charge as part of a plea. But I just had to sit there because I was wrongly jailed and couldn't just hand over $5000 to the courts to be out 3 days earlier. My vehicle was impounded for that whole time so it cost close to $600 to get it out. I also almost lost my job because I couldn't get ahold of anyone to tell them where I was because I didnt get access to a phone. It's all fucked. Meanwhile another guy in there was out in a few hours even though he hit someone in a DUI accident, his like 4th dui arrest, and his bail was only a few hundred which he could easily afford. It also negatively affects sentencing or the trial when you have to show up dirty in jail clothes, compared to bailing out and cleaning up before appearing before a judge, so another layer of unfair."
