todayilearned,fecpvwd,t1_fecm719,1578980341.0,"So true, but not just for ìthe trades.ì Itís interesting to look at the continuity of life and the sorts of benefits and problems that people get in various occupations. And with other life choices, like leisure activities, childbearing, and lifestyle. Some people manage to live their whole lives without physical problems, regardless of their job. But of course there are statistical likelihoods. 

Itís my conclusion that every one of us gives our body to what we do in life. Yes, physical work can result in injuries and repetitive use problems. But sedentary work leads obesity, heart disease, stroke, & high blood pressure. Working as a typist can hurt your hands. [Sidenote: if you have severe hand injuries, what can you do in life? Answer: not much] Even athletic jobs like dancing and playing sports lead to injuries and often permanent issues like headaches, arthritis, etc. Musicians get carpal tunnel and tinnitus.

todayilearned,fecpvwd,t1_fecm719,1578980341.0,"So true, but not just for ‚Äúthe trades.‚Äú It‚Äôs interesting to look at the continuity of life and the sorts of benefits and problems that people get in various occupations. And with other life choices, like leisure activities, childbearing, and lifestyle. Some people manage to live their whole lives without physical problems, regardless of their job. But of course there are statistical likelihoods. 

It‚Äôs my conclusion that every one of us gives our body to what we do in life. Yes, physical work can result in injuries and repetitive use problems. But sedentary work leads obesity, heart disease, stroke, & high blood pressure. Working as a typist can hurt your hands. [Sidenote: if you have severe hand injuries, what can you do in life? Answer: not much] Even athletic jobs like dancing and playing sports lead to injuries and often permanent issues like headaches, arthritis, etc. Musicians get carpal tunnel and tinnitus.

So choose your rut carefully."
