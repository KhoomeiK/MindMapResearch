For now, I'm just going to focus on knowing who I am in Christ and knowing my self-worth."

AskReddit,ffekl44,t1_ffdm0in,1579851943.0,"It was rough for a while. My mom was traumatized by it for obvious reasons and had a very difficult time adjusting to the changes. I was homeschooled by my mom before the accident and she homeschooled me again after being released from the hospital. 8th grade sucked because she was clearly not ready to teach me and I never made it any easier for her. We eventually pushed through and now I just got accepted into my top university after finishing community college last year. She's no longer homeschooling or anything like that, but despite her minor TBI, she's a sharp smart ass who really cares.  
My mom is basically my hero. I wouldn't be where I am today without her. If there was any way to rewrite history, I would, but its not healthy to constantly think about the what-ifs."

Also, does your school have high end computers you can use for sculpting and modeling? What kind of computer do you have?"
rit,ff6860j,t1_ff64qtp,1579621407.0,"My case is very different since I'm a transfer student, but hopefully it's somewhat helpful. 

For your portfolio, draw from life, keep a sketchbook for your ideas (reviewers love seeing what your interested in and how you're experimenting), and keep making models in whatever 3D software your using. Have some kind of goal in mind. Practice and experiment with the fundamentals (form, color, lines, value, etc).

I'm not sure about ACT scores or anything like that. I had a GPA of 3.9 from community college, but I'm not sure if that really played much of a role. 

Either way, I would check the website and email admissions any questions you have regarding scores and the art & design school regarding the portfolio. They have been super helpful to me during this time. 

Hope this helps! Good luck!

AskReddit,feuf6u4,t3_eqm5wm,1579385964.0,"Objectively, there are no god-awful, unwatchable MCU films... only disappointing ones.

With that said, for me, its Captain Marvel, Thor: Dark World, and (at first) Iron Man 3

Captain Marvel's character didn't really develop throughout the film. She only remembered her past throughout the film and that's it. Her cocky personality is still the same, just in a different emphasis. She basically has the personality of Tony Stark while being incredibly powerful without the humbleness (is that even a word) he develops throughout the films, making her the least interesting part of the entire film. Literally everyone else is more interesting that she is. I was really hoping more from a film with MCU's first female lead... and that's coming from someone who loves characters like Gamora and Jessica Jones.

Thor: Dark World is just forgettable.

At first, I was very pissed about the Mandarin twist in Iron Man 3, but looking back on the film, it's still a very enjoyable film to watch. I really love Tony's interactions with Harley. It's by far my favorite part of the film."

FMAB has an amazing story of characters who made mistakes and are trying their hardest to grow and learn from them. A lot of crap happens in the series, but it literally has one of the best endings I've ever seen for a series so bittersweet.

MHA is just, all around, a very motivational series. You literally follow a bullied kid who's following his dream to become a superhero in a world where that's an actual career. 

ATLA is just the best American kids show ever. It has the best balance of action, comedy, character development, and wisdom. Uncle Iroh is easily the best character and Zuko has, by far, the best redemption arc I've ever seen."
