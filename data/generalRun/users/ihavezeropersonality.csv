depression,fekzdup,t3_epm2ch,1579210771.0,What in the actual fuck is wrong with people?
ForeverAloneDating,feklxd3,t1_feiax5g,1579202789.0,Thank you. Someone who isn’t too serious lol
demisexuality,fekl4h1,t1_fek08za,1579202309.0,Wow a normal comment. Thanks.
demisexuality,fekkllt,t1_fejbso2,1579202003.0,"I wouldn’t even feel responsible or guilty.

You know what you’re right. It’s just my own apathy to small things like this. I forgot it’s not people’s own fault for their brain making them emotional. I’ll just delete my comment I guess idk. Sorry to the OP. I actually somewhat mean it. I tend to do these things when I myself am in a bad mood."
ForeverAloneDating,fej98hq,t1_fej8u8k,1579162430.0,"I’m not your buddy, pal. Go white knight in her dm’s."
demisexuality,fej97s7,t1_feiqukc,1579162402.0,I only make fun of people who deserve it. Getting that mad over a general comment is stupid.
ForeverAlone,fej93xr,t1_fei2tps,1579162258.0,"I think you’re too hard on yourself. Social anxiety is a pretty common thing and makes people do some silly stuff. And people just do silly things in general. We’re not perfect beings. I used to have a lot of moments that I’d replay in my head at night. I still do that occasionally. But the funny thing is that I’m probably the only one who actually cared about those moments. Most people just forget or focus on their own silliness. 

Also you can make new memories going forward. And mascara becomes less important as you get older. What really matters in the end is how you act. Are you a nice person? Compassionate? Caring? That’s a lot more important than if your lashes look natural."
ForeverAloneDating,fehwvon,t3_ep90qy,1579125471.0,Upvoted for the funny joke at the end.
ForeverAlone,fehwmsh,t3_ep7f3i,1579125329.0,Men are disposable and have been forever.
ForeverAlone,fehll6u,t3_eozys7,1579119018.0,What exactly about youth are you not getting a chance to enjoy?
demisexuality,fehkiyc,t3_ep4dm3,1579118407.0,I’ve never heard of a Demisexual who wants to have sex with a crush they recently met.
demisexuality,fehk75j,t3_ep6zpq,1579118220.0,Nothing. I’d just leave someone like that. Depends on the context tho.
ForeverAloneDating,fehjhfy,t3_ep6mww,1579117804.0,God I hope to find an autistic retarded gf someday. Everyone is way too boring.
FemaleDatingStrategy,fehiyrf,t3_ep4548,1579117499.0,Yea but it still hurts when you never find what you want.
ForeverAlone,fehip9t,t3_ep18t6,1579117345.0,You’re probably the dream girl of like 70% of forever alone males.
demisexuality,feg585g,t1_feg54qt,1579077493.0,Awful bot. Anyone suicidal knows that hotlines are horrible. I bet whatever dumbass who made this is patting himself on the back.
demisexuality,feg54ll,t3_eowq78,1579077358.0,I gave up before even trying. I’ll kill myself and die alone. I’ve never met someone irl who was like this.
demisexuality,fefasv0,t3_eop7ch,1579052211.0,Yea that’s exactly how it is for me. I can still get off to porn n shit tho.
depression,fefa82v,t1_fedrmvd,1579051831.0,Yea I’m like having a hard time too and I haven’t even attempted online dating because I figured it would be just like that. I hope you find someone dude.
depression,fedr7he,t3_eom9dq,1579018144.0,Yea it’s pretty hard. Have you tried online dating?
ForeverAloneDating,fedqz0v,t3_eojjzo,1579017997.0,Try gamer pals if this doesn’t work. Tho that sub is more for friendships. Unfortunately overwatch is mehhhhhh
SuicideWatch,fedqo2v,t3_eokrzu,1579017803.0,Depends on how sensitive you are and if you find someone else who makes you feel a certain way. Can take days. Can take months. Can take years. Usually it takes me years.
SuicideWatch,fedqiyw,t3_eom6lb,1579017713.0,You’ll prob be fine. It’s not a suicide attempt unless you tried to attempt suicide. This seems more of a fuck I just need some peace right now attempt with a side of apathy for death.
ForeverAloneDating,fedqe5r,t3_eoh99s,1579017630.0,You just got out of a relationship and you’re already looking for a rebound lol.
GamerPals,fedq53j,t1_fedhd0j,1579017472.0,I don’t play wow and even I know that’s a cardinal sin.
demisexuality,fedq07p,t3_eogj3d,1579017389.0,No because I don’t hook up or “try to figure myself out.”  Obviously it would feel meh to hook up with someone if you’re somebody who needs an emotional bond.
ForeverAlone,fea8p8d,t3_eo787v,1578945682.0,Lmao it sounds like you're in love with a hooker
ForeverAlone,fe9jin7,t1_fe9ftbc,1578938206.0,That’s disgusting. Especially from someone that ugly.
ForeverAlone,fe4oi2b,t3_enl77m,1578861379.0,First of all shit friend. Second of all low value female. To me this would just be a blessing as I could see their true colors.
demisexuality,fe0lzyc,t3_engwjf,1578815838.0,Not really. Everyone just moves on.
ForeverAlone,fdujoxy,t3_emzaux,1578734109.0,I do that but it’s more of just being lost in thought.
ForeverAlone,fdujex0,t3_en2zk5,1578733991.0,3 where one is insanely close
AskMen,fdsfql4,t3_emte0s,1578701746.0,Most of the time it's when I gym on a whim.

AskMen,fdsf1qu,t3_emzlvl,1578701247.0,What's up with people fucking people twice their age?
AskMen,fdseqxe,t1_fdsekoy,1578701033.0,It still really depends on the person. The reason you don't notice it more in men is because you're not trying to date them. I'm sure there are girls making the same posts about men.
AskMen,fdsefgc,t3_emyly1,1578700808.0,It's because it's a competitive sport and not a game like Mario where you go through levels. Dota is actually one of the most intricate games out there.
AskMen,fdse9wq,t1_fdsc061,1578700701.0,Depends on what you watch
AskMen,fdse5jl,t3_emzgq8,1578700616.0,It all depends on the person. Men do this too.
AskMen,fdse427,t3_emzh5n,1578700587.0,You're very welcome.
ForeverAlone,fdsdicl,t1_fds7dhe,1578700167.0,Oh nah. I was just adding on to the joke. Idk why you're getting downvoted lol
depression,fds5ewe,t1_fds0jbv,1578694752.0,"A polygamous person who told you he'd ""work on us for a little while"". You make it sound like it was a temporary relationship. Also who in their right minds even dates a polygamous person if they themselves are monogamous?  Anyways idc enough about this. Cya."
depression,fdrzerh,t1_fdruu4g,1578691983.0,I mean it’s straight from your own words in your previous posts. Your “daddy” was never yours to begin with lol. But yeah I’m sure if you keep trucking you’ll find someone eventually. Yw for the laugh. Gl.
depression,fdrsrfl,t1_fdrgqsd,1578689150.0,There usually is no answer for depression unless you get lucky with medication/therapy actually working. You can only ride the waves together. Personally it is easy to be there for someone I care about. I'd rather be caring for someone who needs it than anything else tbh. I just don't want this to be a case of you deluding yourself into thinking you don't deserve anyone because you're sad.
ForeverAlone,fdqynme,t1_fdqyf8z,1578676883.0,I don’t have to have a personality to be more personable than these hoes tbh.
depression,fdqyed6,t3_emptwq,1578676726.0,"I can’t even begin to empathize with this. I’d be absolutely destroyed. I’ve seen people bounce back from shit like this though. Maybe if you give it enough time, you’ll make it."
depression,fdqxd9p,t3_emouqq,1578676144.0,"Is this about that poly guy who told you he wasn’t interested in a relationship and you attached yourself to him anyways? Or is this a new one?

You seem to be hating yourself for something that was never going to work out to begin with."
depression,fdqwop5,t3_emr3tr,1578675943.0,"Idk some guy killed himself and people who didn’t even know him were crying and shit. Also my tennis coach killed himself, but he was kind of an ass so nobody cared."
SuicideWatch,fdqwebx,t3_emrmsc,1578675795.0,Overdosing on pills rarely works. Just makes you feel like complete shit for days.
depression,fdqw35q,t3_emjhiq,1578675636.0,I didn’t even start having feelings for girls until high school and people are upset about not dating in middle school. Times have changed.
SuicideWatch,fdqvm0e,t3_emtm35,1578675554.0,Good luck fam
SuicideWatch,fdqvl9x,t3_emm9bw,1578675541.0,"I gotta admit, I don’t think anything is as bad as hell would be if it existed."
ForeverAlone,fdqvf9e,t3_emt7m5,1578675451.0,"I kind of agree and kind of disagree. Personally I wouldn’t share my success story because I understand how it affects people, but I also like to support those who make it out."
SuicideWatch,fdqv40p,t3_emt5up,1578675271.0,"When you get older you can make a wholesome life for yourself. It feels like that’s a long time from now, but before you know it you’ll be old and doing your own thing."
depression,fdquehj,t3_ems507,1578675060.0,"Just talk to him ffs. So annoying when people sabotage themselves for no reason. If my partner was sad, I’d want to be there for them. Not them randomly break up with me because they think I can’t handle it."
SuicideWatch,fdqubxh,t3_emqve5,1578675021.0,Dumb advice
ForeverAlone,fdqtazo,t3_emn5ib,1578674421.0,I’d just be blunt. Playing games is for children.
ForeverAlone,fdqt7y5,t3_emma9a,1578674371.0,"It’s alright I guess. I feel like everything gets normalized over time tho. And if your normal is depressed, then there is no escape."
ForeverAlone,fdqsxjn,t3_ems96e,1578674194.0,"Browse internet, play games, sleep"
ForeverAlone,fdqsr38,t3_emmw04,1578674084.0,Probably just unlucky. It’s pretty normal for people’s crushes to not like them back regardless of gender.
ForeverAlone,fdqscbr,t3_empd0m,1578673832.0,If I were in your shoes I’d ignore her. Women like that are a huge turn off and usually have no personality/compassion.
depression,fdqr3jw,t3_emnbdm,1578673072.0,Cheaters are some of the most disgusting human beings on the planet.
SuicideWatch,fdpd6kw,t3_emkltr,1578625645.0,I don’t see how cute little fuzz balls couldn’t

ForeverAlone,fdp4qof,t1_fdp3kky,1578619959.0,I actually meant bizarre. Good catch tho.
ForeverAlone,fdp2gzn,t3_emj8bs,1578618424.0,Try being single for an extended period of time and then compare the upsides.
SuicideWatch,fdp0rfp,t3_emhpfr,1578617269.0,I’d rather go to community college instead of university for the first 2 years. There’s literally no point in wasting money for easy classes.
SuicideWatch,fdnq1rg,t1_fdnlku6,1578590693.0,"It really depends on the person. Some get over someone in 2 weeks. Others take years. Personally it takes me a long time to get over someone I cared about. It took years for my sister to get over her ex, but now she's happily married to a great guy. Just gotta be patient. Our biology sucks."
depression,fdmedx0,t1_fdmd45z,1578547168.0,Exercising is so hard when depressed. I continuously cycle between getting really in shape and losing everything I worked for. I recommend finding a gym buddy so you force each other into going.
depression,fdmb7v9,t3_elplvd,1578544498.0,I’d prob get stabbed
depression,fdmb5j4,t3_eloc1r,1578544445.0,"Just pray to god to heal your depression, bro."
SuicideWatch,fdmb1bb,t3_elp9zs,1578544353.0,The term is called ambiguous grief. It’s an awful feeling.
depression,fdmam3z,t3_elpqma,1578544021.0,A simple google search reveals depression dating sites exist. Not sure why nobody researches anything.
SuicideWatch,fdm9iyq,t3_elra1f,1578543190.0,It baffling to me why so many people in the world are straight up garbage.
depression,fdm913w,t1_fdltmsl,1578542819.0,"It only arrives unexpectedly for girls for the most part. If you’re a guy, you’re going to have to work for it."

depression,fdm78wd,t3_em3yjg,1578541519.0,Yea you’re getting depressive episodes. I’d see a doctor.
depression,fdm75x8,t3_em40kf,1578541461.0,I crave that from anyone
depression,fdm73xb,t3_em1t4l,1578541422.0,I’ve been on like 5 or 6 different medications. There’s really nothing to be scared about and it helps some people.
demisexuality,fdm6psn,t3_em3iju,1578541144.0,No idea. I’m still waiting to make that mistake with someone.
depression,fdm6mus,t3_em3ex4,1578541085.0,I’m 25 year old dude as well as my friend and we both have tons of plushies on our beds.
SuicideWatch,fdm6fbc,t3_em3grt,1578540935.0,Pretty normal to feel this way after a breakup with someone you cared about. Things just take time to heal. Eventually you won’t think about him constantly and you can move on.
depression,fdm5zu2,t3_em30j6,1578540631.0,Some girls aren’t complete shit so don’t give up hope
ForeverAloneDating,fdlsula,t1_fdlsh6r,1578531681.0,My comment gives like no indication of my personality. I mean good one dude xD
demisexuality,fdlsco3,t1_fdls9c0,1578531343.0,I’ve been on the internet for a pretty long time. You’re literally less than an ant in my eyes. Also you’re clearly autistic. You’re welcome to continue harassing me tho. I think it’s fun tbh.
ForeverAlone,fdlrbxa,t3_em1djn,1578530647.0,Yea and suicide
ForeverAlone,fdlnvfo,t3_em1a18,1578528289.0,I’d kill myself if I was a girl who did that. I’d see myself as having no value whatsoever.
ForeverAloneDating,fdlngkv,t3_em0glr,1578528010.0,I had similar beliefs. Nobody is doing that. Especially not girls lmao. Pretty much just wasted your younger years waiting for that special person who doesn’t exist.
demisexuality,fdlmhez,t1_fdlflvn,1578527365.0,I have no interest in getting laid. It’s not hard to get sex. Don’t project your own insecurities on me lol.
demisexuality,fdl9j9o,t3_elymml,1578519350.0,"Same. If sex/sexual attraction didn’t exist, I’d probably be a lot happier. It’s so hard for me to trust people because of it."
depression,fdkwm60,t3_elx51h,1578512668.0,"Try to include him on things, even if it's just being sad in bed together. That's what I'd want at least."
ForeverAlone,fdkwcol,t3_elwy8a,1578512514.0,I mean sex is teachable. Pretty obvious that all you have to do is communicate. Are people legitimately this retarded?
SuicideWatch,fdkolb5,t3_elv7z6,1578507902.0,"Mine is me hitting this guy full swing with a hatchet, but that guy is me."
SuicideWatch,fdkg2q6,t1_fdkfxjw,1578503120.0,I mean just look at yourself. You care way too much about what people say online. Hence why I said go stay off the internet and go outside. Or keep getting mad at objectively meaningless things. Your choice.
ForeverAlone,fdkfy3k,t3_elrci5,1578503041.0,"I get bugged cause sex doesn’t even feel that good to me. It’s like damn, was I born wrong? Why does everyone moan when it’s not that intense?"
SuicideWatch,fdkfkey,t1_fdkfhzy,1578502809.0,Cringe.
ForeverAlone,fdkffuy,t3_elnqn0,1578502733.0,I got rid of the chest feeling with citalopram. Shit is awful. Psychiatrist said it was probably stress and I’m inclined to believe him. It’s like straight cortisol flowing through your veins.
SuicideWatch,fdkf5z9,t3_eltu5y,1578502567.0,Stay off the internet and go outside.
