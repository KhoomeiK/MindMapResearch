unpopularopinion,ffnbmfu,t1_ffnbgr6,1580064037.0,Nah. They tend to be religious communities that view the wife as subservient or would look down on a woman for seeking a divorce

unpopularopinion,ffmmi8a,t1_ffmgy00,1580056696.0,"more women attempt suicide, more men commit because they tend to use more violent methods 

that’s lowkey a flawed statistic.

I get you’re frustrated, but you also said you’re a teenager. Everyone treats you like shit as a teenager, it’ll get better and people really won’t care about your emotional expression as an adult and if they do they probably shouldn’t be your friend"

MGTOW,fem1lf8,t1_fem11rg,1579236793.0,"I mean honestly in the eyes of society  and the government women were below men for a very long time. It’s reasonably recent I would say that women truly achieved equality, and only in certain countries.

I’m not a huge fan of a lot of the advantages women now have and view them as unnecessary but there are still weird niche things that women are unequal with in terms of men, and vice versa. 

I would never say I’m not a feminist because of course as a woman i’ll always support women, but that doesn’t mean I agree with everything
every feminist stands for. Much like I don’t know if you’d necessarily agree with everything every one in every belief set you identified with said."
MGTOW,felxlqj,t1_fel44qu,1579233503.0,"Sorry I was at work. But honestly I would say the last real radical feminists that were a positive influence for women were the first generation ones. Modern radical feminists only serve to make women and feminists a laughing stock.

And as far as the benefits you discussed seeing as many women don’t “take advantage” (I don’t see a lengthy divorce process as a positive tbqh) of that all it serves to do is make men more cautious about relationships, which is once again a net negative."
MGTOW,fekoti1,t3_eplo1t,1579204511.0,"Ugh I know my comment will be deleted and I’ll be blocked for being a wahmen but whatever I’ll bite.

Most of the people in the feminist community don’t like radfems and disavow them. It’s super easy to see it as acceptable because they, like incel or femcel subs live in an echo chamber where more radical voices are elevated and visual. 

It’s really unfortunate because the views expressed on those subreddits and vocalizations of hatred and radicalized thinking aren’t common and aren’t the norm.

Just like on this sub, I’m sure that there are guys here that are kind and normal and just want to live their best life get drowned out by radicalized vitriol and that’s what people see and what gets spread and what others perception is.

It sucks that both sides aren’t viewed by everyone as equally vile, but it’s easy to look at your side and go “i am right they are wrong” and both sides of the feminist and antifeminist debate are equally guilty of it"
