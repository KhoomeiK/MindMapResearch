That shit keeps you up at night. It causes health issues and heart attacks. The people who can do it are a special breed, and even then it can kill them even when they are the best. I worry about by buddy a lot but know that someone like him is who I want to be a firefighter. He still held that kids hand, he still told the parents of the kids in the atv, he’s still done much more that I’ll never hear about cause he takes care of the job at hand then breaks down after.

Got lucky the bank that he used was owned by a friend who knew he would make it back. Basically fronted him the money and told him to find an investment broker. 

He meets with a few ‘give me your money and I’ll double it every year’ people. His family friend said with money, “if it’s too good to be true, it isn’t true”. Shaq ends up meeting a Jewish accountant who says he might get him just a few percentage points of returns every year. Shaq has been with the same investor ever since. 

Random Shaq fact- the General is the only auto insurance who would insure him as a kid so he wanted to be their spokesman. Was told he does it for free.

Edit 2: I repeated what Shaq said. He met an Jewish accountant. He said it, was repeating his story.  No it doesn’t really add to the story, yes I wish I didn’t put it so I wouldn’t have to read the 20+ “why’d you say he’s a Jew” comments.
