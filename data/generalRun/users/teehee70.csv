My brain keeps going but my body just turns the off button and I crash out hard. No peopling. Nothing. I take a couple days of barely moving then I'm charged up once again.

The youngest one took offense at his older bro putting him in jail that he junk punched him then flipped the board while walking away. Yeah that story will be told at his wedding. You always gotta watch out for the baby of the family.
AmItheAsshole,ff4y3ec,t1_ff42yze,1579575225.0,Why would your ex threaten to revisit the custody agreement? He's almost 18 so he can do what he wants to at that point can't he? He sounds jealous and upset by your new child and his new sibling.

TrueOffMyChest,fep8yo7,t3_epzvdl,1579314806.0,Guy in our area just died this way. I drove past him almost hitting him. He had no back lights on and was wearing all black. Couldn't see him until you were on top of him. An hour after I had gotten home the news stated he's been hit and was killed. He'd been riding his bicycle with only a small headlight and no backlights.

AskReddit,femzmvw,t3_eptxb3,1579273643.0,My uncle  hung himself in his basement from the rafters. My young cousin came home from school and found him hanging. She described his tongue sticking out and being purple. They moved shortly after but my family was wrecked about it it was a small town and people talked about it. I was in class and a girl had no idea it was my uncle and was talking about how they found him as her dad was one of the guys called on sight. I just left the room until she was done talking. No one knew it was my uncle. Rip uncle Ray. We didn't know the bank was taking the house. Wish you weren't so old school that you couldn't talk about things.  Thr aunt spent so much money that ray couldn't keep up and was losing the house. No one had a clue until after he passed on.
AskReddit,femxyc6,t3_eptxb3,1579272487.0,My ex called cps and police on me after I left him with our son for his abusive behavior. My son doesn't know details of it and I never plan on telling him. It was bad. Police came and checked my place out and I heard them tell cps on the phone that you could eat off my floors it was immaculate and my son looked great sleeping in his crib. They were so nice to me. The lady who took the phone call actually called my ex and chewed him out for being so ignorant and they never bothered me again. It was so tough with my ex that I look back years later and think I'm glad I got away.

canada,fe5pofr,t1_fe3ozt7,1578872702.0,We heard that it was one of the valves breaking on Fri and leaking toxic water but it was contained. We had a pretty big storm last night with wind gusts up to 50 k so perhaps that had something to do with this. But Holy shit eh
canada,fe5ob76,t1_fe2yqp3,1578872079.0,Never got the oops but we sure got the alert. The oops sorry bout that didn't occur until an hour or so later. I tell you it was like the war of the world's broadcast. Some of the stuff on friends feeds made me rethink who they are. I just got another from a buddy pointing out that she'd heard from friends who had basically already given up ready to die thinking it was real. We live like two hours away and still got the alert this am.

AmItheAsshole,fdw8meo,t3_emy819,1578756210.0,I'd say work on moving out. Getting into college or university and moving far far away. My mom did this with my things and turns out it was her baggage and problems not mine. I moved away after getting into school and discovered an entirely new world of respect and boundaries and safety. Good luck to you and hang in there.

AskReddit,fdshp9v,t3_emvveb,1578702953.0,"I'm in a crafting group on FB that started with 800 crafters and a few days later there are 6k
There are hubs collecting the finished things and lists of patterns and what we need to make.  We are making bat wraps and Joey pouches and nests. We then deliver them to a hub where everyone is collecting everything then packing it up. Then we find a person who is going to Australia and they can bring it on with them as extra luggage. Some of us are shipping it to Australia on our own. There are thousands of crafters doing this all over Canada. I can post the name of the sight on FB if anyone is a crafter and wants to help. I'm not sure what the rules are on here for sharing."
AmItheAsshole,fdrsz1u,t3_emrycx,1578689277.0,Buy lacteze and have it on everywhere. My son is hugely lactose intolerant. He's learned to have this stuff on hand at any given moment not because I purposely cook things with cream in them but just in case he's caught unawares.
