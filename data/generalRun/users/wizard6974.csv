MachinePorn,ff1d9km,t1_ff010ak,1579477705.0,"I admit defeat: 2.5 hours on & I cannot find info on the scope the planes used to shoot Polaris in daylight. The usaf had a couple systems,  the astro dome on our c-130's as well as kollsman periscope star sights and a drift tube that looked down on the EC-121's. They all used omega which was pretty reliable I was told. Also found that 747's originally had sextant mounts and USAF and USN stopped celnav classes in 96 but the navy brought them back couple years ago out of fear of EMP and other attacks on rnav. One source mentioned that mil planes and pole crossing airlines had equip to shoot ""9 -11 stars in daytime"" and didn't elaborate.  One former missile eng said many have ability to track one star and they couple the data to the ins. Wish I had asked more questions when I had the chance. Btw, mil copters used to have ins, maybe still do.  Hover over to the landmark, initialize, proceed to turn jet fuel into heat & noise. Good times.."

pics,fetofev,t1_fet55m1,1579377601.0,"True, however the records talked about here were for planes that took off under their own power from Earth and landed again. The X-15 was dropped from a B-52 that was already at altitude, then the rocket motor kicked in and flew a ballistic trajectory until it ran out and turned the aircraft into a glider. Fun fact:

 The X-15's [official world record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_airspeed_record) for the highest speed ever recorded by a crewed, powered aircraft, set in October 1967 when [William J. Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Knight) flew at [Mach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number) 6.70 at 102,100 feet (31,120 m), a speed of 4,520 miles per hour (7,274 km/h; 2,021 m/s), has remained unbroken as of 2020. 

(also, 71 drivers as well as the 15 crew all awarded astronaut wings because they went over 50 miles of altitude)"
