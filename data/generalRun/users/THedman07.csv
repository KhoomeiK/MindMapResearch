Renewables don't provide on demand energy they never will. If storage actually becomes viable (and you're going to say it is, but it isn't) then the equation will change but you're going to have to factor grid level storage into the cost of renewables. Nuclear is expensive, but it's something that can be done now instead of waiting for some miracle technology to come along.
