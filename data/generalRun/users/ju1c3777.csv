relationship_advice,fgm7mog,t3_ez8xnk,1580919490.0,"The fact that they used the money for something else and didn't tell you until you brought it up, is a major red flag. I've seen my parents struggling with money, but never taking any money from me and if they asked me for money, they'd tell me why they need it and pay me back. 

All that said, it is up to you to decide when and if you wanna help them (doesn't matter if they're family, you're in no obligation to help), and they can't make you feel guilty about it. Rough patches does not allow them to take your money without your consent or even lie to you about how they use it, especially when they might be jeopardizing your education."

Thank you, thank you. In my 29 years on this planet, I have never understood the whole ""love yourself..."" crap until today; your explanation makes sense. Holy crap, I am somewhat overcome with emotion, it may sound like  I am exaggerating, but I am not.

  
I have never intended to project myself onto others...   


While I don't judge others, I do assume a lot how they perceive me, even without knowing me at all, and more often than not, it isn't positive. 

Now I have a ton of work figuring out how to like myself after all these years..."

I think I just don't know how to use the camera or play around with the settings, I'm not very knowledgeable when it come to photography.
Also, I wish there was a working .apk of the Google Camera app for the Exynos model, currently, it only works in Snapdragon models"

Out of the stereotypes, I suffered depression a few years back, and it is very common for people to associate metal to depression or some sort of emotional/attention-seeking problem, I even had a xo worker a few years back asked me if I had any sort of mental condition. I also suck with girls, you get that one as well. 

I'm a very organized person and very clean with my body and I have been going to the gym for the past 2.5 years or so (still have a long way to go).

I am very shy with people I don't know and tend to sit on the back and observe, but it takes very little for me to start feeling comfortable around people I recently met and be more extroverted.  However, I do not go out of my way to initiate conversations with unknown people. 

Regarding the shirt, I'm just a huge metal fan and enjoy supporting the bands I listen to if I like their merch enough, and I am not much of a formal clothes dresser. Also try to listen to bands that try to convey something coherent or with purpose, however hard it might be to understand them. Cattle Decapitation (the band on the shirt I'm wearing in the pic) lyrics talk about the end of the world caused by humans and their actions, and while I don't entirely agree with some of their lyrics, their message resonates with me somewhat."
