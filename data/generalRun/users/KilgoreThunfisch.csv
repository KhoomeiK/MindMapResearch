1. I went to the doctors about 6 months back for an ear infection, had to see two doctors and was later prescribed medication for my ear. The entire thing cost me 5. My health insurance covered everything else.

2. The average university tuition costs here range between [150 to 250, a semester.](https://www.studieren-in-deutschland.org/was-kostet-es-in-deutschland-zu-studieren/)

3. My rent for a single room apartment in the downtown of an old medieval city is 1/4 of my paycheck. (This is my personal luck. Depending on where you live it can be more, to be fair.)

4. I get 31 vacations days a year. [The minimum required by law is 24 days](https://info-arbeitsrecht.de/Urlaub/urlaub.html). I also get unlimited sick days, assuming a doctor can verify that I am infact sick after day 3 of my illness.

5. I had to have my wisdom teeth taken out, that cost me 0. Because my insurance covered it.

The company I work for makes custom products. You as a customer are paying to get the thing as you submitted it to us. Sometimes mistakes happen, maybe a logo is missing from one of your special mugs or something. Our policy when an order gets messed up is this: we ask you to keep the wrong one you already got and paid full price for, but then ask you to pay 50% off for the corrected replacement... Why should you pay more to get a corrected version of what you paid money for in the first place? Their thought is that they're giving you a great deal for the corrected one. Each product must be paid for, period. Whether it was wrong or not.
