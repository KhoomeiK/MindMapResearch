AskMen,ff58hq7,t3_erlbbu,1579583369.0,"So I met this girl on OkC when I was like 24 or 25. From pics she was a pretty hot goth type everything I'm into. We meet at a pretty classy gastropub and she's a good bit older than in her pics, which should've been my first red flag, but she was still pretty fine, and dressed pretty provocatively. Eventually we talk about jobs, and she just openly volunteers she lives off of her disability payments from her schizophrenia and child support from her ex-husband. I think that's a red flag for most people, but I happen to also have a mild schizoaffective disorder myself, and get what it's like to even be dating at all when you're basically fucked by god. Like I honestly feel bad for her.

So around that time she starts getting pretty physical with me, which if you've never experienced before is pretty gosh darn flattering. Eventually she asks if I'd like to ""continue this party at her place."" This phrase has stuck with me like Dante witnessing the sign ""abandon all hope ye who enter here"" at the gates of hell. I say yes, and seal my fate.

She'd mentioned earlier in our talks about mental illness that she was unable to drive, so I offer to drive us. She lived in a part of town that I'd never been before, but didn't have a stellar reputation but living off of disability and child support doesn't really equate luxury. And besides, I lived in the housing projects when I was a younger kid, and was (as is the theme of this tale) kinda desperately and naÃ¯vely curious. 

We arrive at her place, and it just looks like a normal house from the outside, maybe a little shabby, but still nothing like the coffin-box quadraplexes I was prepared for. She opens the door and the assault on my senses begins. Old cigarette smoke, dirty dishes, mounds of trash, and worst of all the single most unhappy tank of turtles I've ever seen. Every instinct tells me I should run not walk back to my car. She grabs my dick, and the star wars-esque battle between the light and dark side begins in my head. I'll let you take a guess about which side won, and why this haunts me. It actually gets worse after that, but I'd have to get some booze in me before I dredge up that filth, and it's midnight and I have work in the morning.

8======>~~~

Edit of continuation:
So anyway we made our way into the filthy living room and makeout on a couch that puffed a cloud if dust and cigarette ash as we sat on it. Eventually we watch some terrible fucking anime, I don't remember the name offhand, but it was a fantasy setting and the main character had that super annoying loud angry kid voice. The smell at this point has given me a tremendous headache and possibly a small high that makes me now give some credence to the real existence of jenkem. Her roomie comes home at some point with a dude and they have very loud sex in the roommate's room. She seriously sounded like a cringy pornstar who was role playing a cat. That's when she looks at me and asks ""wanna compete with them?""

This is the most horrific and surreal situation I've ever been in. Obviously I wish I wasn't there and I glance at the diseased-looking turtles and swear they return the same pleading look I had. So naturally my nerd ass freezes up and I mumble... ""sure.""

So we walk down the equally filthy hallway and her room is essentially a ballpit of crusty stuffed animals, a bare single mattress on the floor, and shelves of sex toys. Yes, I didn't mean a shelf. There were at least five shelves and racks filled with the widest variety of dildos, vibrators, strapons, floggers, dragon tails, shackles... you get the picture. I've always considered myself kinky, but her version of foreplay would probably be illegal in many states. So in this scene I'm just kinda rolling with it as a veritable army of stuffed animals stares on with cold, glassy eyes... which is when there's a knock at the door followed by a small voice calling out ""mommy?""

I believe I've worn a permanent frown since then. I left shortly afterward, opened a bottle of Jameson and downed almost all of it in an hour. But hey I didn't get an STD, so really the pain is all emotional. 

Thanks for attending my Ted Talk and go fuck yourselves."

WitcherNetflix,ff43ttj,t1_ff408js,1579554936.0,"TL;DR All my opinion, which might be laughable to some.

Honestly a lot Tarantino's catalogue could be As, somewhat ironically. Perhaps Westworld, I haven't seen season 2 yet but season 1 is at least a B. In video games, Outer Worlds is a contender, as is the Fallout franchise. Likely many more I'm just not thinking about.

 I think it bothers me more in fantasy than other genres because it's basically a free pass to do whatever you want, but almost always what they choose to do is have either random black people sprinkled about or have the at this point stereotypical (almost always warlike, terribly into honor/glory/tradition, and tribal [and this is among my complaints with Black Panther]) black nation then point at that and call it done. I kinda think it would be easier to just decide where the equator is, what world trade and affluence looks like, and try to cast from there. Hollywood being essentially a cult famously hostile to outsiders, and systemic problems are contributing factors, but I also can't help but wonder if that being ""an open secret"" makes it a cyclical self-fulfilling prophecy.

I'm white, and most of this sentiment comes from the strange amount of non-white actor friends I've had. And I also do think we're getting better, or at least trying. And if trying is part of the rubric, some things go up and other things go down. I'd also have to do a lot more research on why casting decisions were made."
