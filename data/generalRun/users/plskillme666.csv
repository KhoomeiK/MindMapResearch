vegan,ff3axv7,t1_ff2avkq,1579537637.0,But the thing is I don’t eat that meal 3x a day. I’ve literally eaten it once. You can’t make assumptions off one post and assume that’s all I eat. I’ve done extensive research and eat at least 50 grams of protein a day. And OP probably felt like garbage a week after starting because she wasn’t eating enough calories. This is the best I have ever felt mentally and physically. I’ll never look back.

A female cow can only reproduce for so long until she is no longer able to, thus she will be killed. Calves are also almost instantly taken away from their mothers at birth. Male calves will go straight to the slaughterhouse to be used for veal while female calves will endure the same pain and torture their mothers went through.

 If one consumes dairy then they are supporting unnecessary deaths of cows. Hope this makes sense.
