He’ll sit there a good 10 minutes or more, every single day, and stare at me like I’m the most fascinating thing in the world (or he’s contemplating my demise).

Just roll with it. Your cat must be entertained by the shiny bits or the teensy bit of a reflection. Who knows."

I don’t honestly know how you can ever gain her trust back. Unless she wants to have a chance to get out there and have a fling or two herself. Open relationships are a thing. But if not, if she can’t get over this then it’s probably best that you go your separate ways. And learn your damn lesson- never do this cheating shit again."
AmItheAsshole,ffooeqm,t1_ffni92n,1580079914.0,"Yeah- exactly. So taking the pregnant cat to “the vet” is a great choice. Like you said, they can provide resources. No vet is going to abort the pregnancy against OP’s gf’s wishes.

And no, I don’t think she’s the asshole. Everyone is allowed to overreact from time to time when they’re passionate about something and someone basically stomps all over those emotions."

Using that language (chill out, calm down) is like throwing gasoline on a fire. It’s offensive and discredits a person’s feelings. You should have listened and then tried to explain that you were nervous about ending up with a bunch of kittens.

She also overreacted. I understand why she was upset- a stray cat being pregnant is even more reason to take it in and bring it to the vet. The vet can take the kittens off your hands and adopt them out, and then get the cat spayed. However, I think her reaction to being told to chill out was a bit over the top. But like I said, she was already upset and you basically took her feelings and implied that she was being over the top and her feelings weren’t valid when you told her to “chill out”. It’s a pretty insulting phrase. Both of you could have handled all of it better."
Advice,ffnacak,t3_euajwx,1580063646.0,"Why don’t you see if there are employment opportunities at the VA? You’ll get veterans’ preference and get good pay and benefits, even if you’re working a job that isn’t IT. I’m talking janitor, food service, etc. They may not seem like glamorous jobs but you’ll earn lots of vacation time and a pension if you work there.

ETA: I just saw that your family thinks those jobs are a waste, but you have to remind them and yourself that at this point, doing nothing is a bigger waste. With health insurance through employment with the VA on top of your regular VA benefits, you’ll be able to seek out excellent doctors for mental health care (outside of the VA) and get on meds that help. Then you can see what you want to do next.

You probably wouldn’t/shouldn’t own a boat and a vacation home (unless you invest wisely or don’t have kids- kids are expensive). 

To become a doctor though, think about how many years of school and residency they have to get through before they start making anywhere NEAR the type of money you’re thinking of.

You should be no more scared of this virus than you are of the flu. Yes, it can be dangerous to people with weakened immune systems, but if you’re healthy then you probably won’t experience anything much worse than an unpleasant respiratory infection.

Part of the reason these things spread like crazy in Asia is because overpopulation is a big problem. When you have that many people in close contact, germs spread easily. Best way to avoid catching this virus (or any other virus) is to WASH YOUR HANDS frequently, especially after touching doorknobs, carts, elevator buttons, etc."

Advice,ffgqczr,t3_etj9rk,1579912379.0,"It’s hard to relax because your brain is always overthinking. It honestly sounds more like an anxiety problem rather than an intelligence problem; you’re fixating on this one thing and it’s making you feel crazy. I would recommend going to the doctor and explaining that you’re anxious all the time and constantly overthinking things. It could really help to get on something like Zoloft. Research it, don’t discount it. It helped me so incredibly much.

Other than that, it’s a matter of how you perceive what people think about you. My life got a whole lot better when I started laughing more. You said something dumb and everyone laughed? That’s funny, laugh with them! Everyone says dumb stuff... ALL THE TIME. I’m a nurse in an intensive care unit. Work with some of the best and brightest people out there. Do they say dumb stuff? YEP. And it’s hilarious when they do, and they laugh about it too. My husband? Brilliant man. Can take apart and put together practically anything, can steer a large boat down crazy twists and turns on the river for work. Does he sometimes say dumb stuff? Yeah!

French (or Spanish or whatever language) club, band, drama (although you might get overshadowed by bigger personalities), tennis, any sort of film club. Maybe not sports so much because those people are highly competitive and are probably already friends. A book club would be perfect!!!! Go to football games, volunteer to work the concession stands sometimes, maybe try to get on student council.

It takes awhile, but the big thing is just putting yourself in situations where you’re with people who are focusing on the same thing. Then you always have something in common and something to talk about. One of the hardest things for me as an introvert was feeling like I didn’t have anything to talk to people about.

Washing too often actually throws your vagina’s pH out of whack, killing the normal and healthy bacteria and allowing more yeast and harmful bacteria to grow. Your vagina is self-cleaning. You should rinse with water when you shower but that’s about it.

Your boyfriend needs to do his own research. You need to tell him to do this, because he’s dead wrong and he’s messing up your self esteem.

One thing you could do is to try taking probiotics, like acidophilus. That’s a pill you can get at any store that sells vitamins, and it just helps your body develop healthy immunity to bad bacteria. 

Also- if you’re getting recurrent UTIs then you may also want to see a urologist. Some women’s bladders don’t completely empty which can lead to a buildup of bacteria. Again, this has nothing to do with your hygiene!

Faith aside, you are YOUNG. You guys are going to change so much over the next 10 years that you probably won’t even recognize the people you are now. I’m a strong advocate for marrying later in life, and there are tons of studies that reflect the success of marriages that occur in the late 20s-30s as opposed to teens and early 20s. To be blunt- your brain isn’t even finished developing until closer to 24 or 25. 

So if you want to be traditional and a man of God then I guess you should stay. But in my opinion, that’s being unfair to both you and her. If you really want to explore what life has to offer and grow emotionally and mentally, then you should probably move on. Appreciate the relationship for what it was- a beautiful teenage romance that taught you tons of lessons about love, romance, and communication. Don’t stick around so long that the whole thing turns sour. 

Marriage isn’t all fun and love and fairytales, as you know. It takes a ton of work, just like your current relationship. However, when you’re older and have more experiences and relationships under your belt, you have better tools to handle the stresses that come with married life. And by then, you’ll have had time to “do you” and have fun and won’t have regrets about what your life could’ve been if you’d experienced being single for awhile."

Glad you’re having so much luck! I met my amazing husband on a dating app- never would’ve crossed paths in the real world but here we are!

Edit: just thought of this too... women are going to be more comfortable making moves and initiating within the context of an app because they’ve already received the confidence of a mutual match.

As far as fear of being with someone, at some point you have to make a conscious decision to allow yourself to be vulnerable. It’s scary and it can feel uncomfortable, but if you stick to it (don’t ghost, don’t sabotage, just keep talking and dating the right person) then eventually it will start to feel more comfortable. You’ll kind of get in the “routine” of being in a relationship and it won’t feel so scary and impossible.

As for fear of being hurt, well, that’s just something we all have to live with if we want to find love. Try to change your mindset, find some optimism within yourself. “I’m going to take the plunge and date this person, I may end up hurt but I’m not going to think about that.

A lingering, heated kiss in the morning and texts throughout the day. You honestly sound like you might need to speak with a sex therapist because you have unrealistic expectations."
Parenting,ff1n6xo,t3_er50pp,1579481970.0,"My son loves Xbox and sports. I got a huge wall decal that says “eat, sleep, GAME” with an xbox controller. He also has a gamer poster and color-changing LED lights around the ceiling, and a map of the United States. 

All in all, very cheap stuff but things that make him feel like it’s his personal space. Google “gaming posters” or “sports posters” or whatever he’s interested in, then show him and have him pick his favorites."
Advice,ff1mcw8,t3_er529v,1579481565.0,"I believe that people are not themselves when they’re blackout drunk. I’ve seen people piss on the carpet because they saw a toilet that wasn’t there, and do things that are just mind boggling.

So yeah. Stop drinking. You really won’t be missing anything and you’ll keep your dignity and self control in the future.

Thing is though, you’re both heavy drinkers? Something tells me that your relationship won’t really work if you quit drinking and he continues. Seems like a lot of your relationship relies on activities that involve alcohol, and I can see him pressuring you to drink in the future and maybe guilting you. You probably won’t like being around his wasted self while you’re sober. So yeah, maybe the relationship just needs to end so you can focus on bettering yourself."
relationship_advice,ff1lo0s,t3_er52e9,1579481215.0,"Do you initiate or what do you do to get the ball rolling with sex? Why don’t you try kissing her more often, and maybe turning it into an impromptu makeout session? 

Adults aren’t always just ready to get it on, sometimes the mood has to be created. If she’s always shooting you down, ask her to try to be more open to letting sex happen before flat out rejecting you. She probably has a lot on her mind and it can be hard to switch gears and get aroused. Be touchy, be flirtatious, take time trying to get her in the mood."
relationship_advice,ff1g74o,t3_er4qra,1579478720.0,"She’s being very idealistic about this and not considering the actual logistics. If you’re head over heels for this girl then it’s worth a shot, but honestly, if your heart isn’t in it then just pull of the bandaid. Tell her you’re sorry but you want to focus on college and don’t want to continue the relationship. Don’t let her guilt you into staying when you say this; she’ll definitely be upset but you’re sparing her in the long run."
socialskills,ff1f3ey,t3_eqxfj0,1579478372.0,"My thoughts for activities to make friends:

-look up local groups on meetup.com; you can go to board game nights, join a hiking group, join any kind of group. They’re people like you, looking to broaden their social circles. Give it some time and then maybe ask some of the ones you’ve clicked with if they want to hit up a bar and watch a game or something super chill. Go from there.

-start taking jiu-jitsu or another martial art. Great way to try something awesome and also have common ground to talk to people. If you like some of the guys there you can do the same thing, see if they want to grab a beer after practice or if they want to go to a UFC fight together.

I fall into the same rut. I end up losing friends because the anxious/depressed side of me doesn’t have the confidence or motivation to keep up with friendships. Just be consistent, don’t cancel on people once you start making plans and make sure you go to events you’re invited to. You got this, put yourself out there!

Edit: more thoughts that lead to common ground and meeting people:

-rock climbing gym! So much fun, and I’m not in the greatest shape. 

-volunteermatch.com- again with having common ground. You can volunteer regularly and then get to know the people you’re around"

TwoXChromosomes,fdwwn2v,t3_emzkfo,1578763025.0,"I’m 32 and have a 12 year old. I just married a wonderful man who’s 30. It’s crazy because when I talk to women who are already moms, they seem to totally understand why we’ve decided not to “start over” and have another child. They get that we want to have a life of our own after we raise our one kiddo and our family feels complete.

The weird thing is that HE is the one who hears the most negative comments about it, and mostly from other guys who have kids. They constantly tell him he’ll change his mind (he won’t, he’s been firm on this for years) or he’s missing out etc etc. I honestly think on some level it might be a little jealousy... we can afford to go on trips, go out for motorcycle rides because it’s easy to find a sitter for one older kiddo as opposed to multiple kids; we plan to take flying lessons, etc. They want us to have kids so we can relate to the struggles they’re dealing with, in my opinion. Otherwise, why wouldn’t they just let it go?

(my son is included in trips and is spoiled rotten- just clarifying for the people who mistake my comment to mean that we go off and leave him to do our own thing. He’s older so he’s more independent, I’m just talking about the perks of not having more babies- babies are exhausting and we just don’t want to do it.)"

Sorry, this is the most annoying thing about reddit. You can’t say anything without somebody getting self righteous and shooting you down.

AskReddit,fcuy851,t3_eixc75,1577990902.0,"I used a few different apps for about a year. I was taking time to get to know myself, trying new hobbies and, although I’m shy and introverted, also making myself get out there and go on dates.

It was good for me, and eye opening. I realized what I did and didn’t want in a partner, learned how to communicate better,  and learned how to handle rejection without taking it personally.

I started talking to a guy on plenty of fish who worked as a deckhand on a tugboat. It took us a couple months to actually meet because he was away so much for his job, but we talked constantly. Once we finally met, things took off pretty fast. He was steadfast, responsible, smart. He was a little shy too, but eventually we both came out of our shells and I discovered that he’s hilarious.

He’s now my husband :). The first year was hard because I had to get used to his schedule. It was new for me, not being in a relationship where I was attached at the hip to someone to the point of it being unhealthy. It was all part of me learning how to love myself and enjoy my time on my own while also having a happy, healthy relationship.

It’s been almost 3 years, married since October and happier every minute. I never would have met him if not for the Internet; our paths just never crossed. I’m a huge supporter of online dating. Yeah, there are tons of creeps out there and honestly, you’re not going to be compatible with MOST people you come across. Just be patient, use it as a learning experience. You might find someone who makes an amazing partner."
