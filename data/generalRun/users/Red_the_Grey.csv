My depression had won the battle, but not the war."

depression,ffcddsx,t3_essxe0,1579797034.0,"It’s ok to feel your feelings, but you’re stronger than most. You’re out here opening up to things that many people wouldn’t even consider sharing word about. That’s strength, I’m inspired by it. I fight my depression in silence. I wear my everything is ok mask daily. I don’t have the courage to ask for help. I don’t have the courage to let anyone get close enough to know me and what I hold inside. So I admire you, I hope you continue sharing, I hope you continue living, I hope this feeling is temporary, I love you."
