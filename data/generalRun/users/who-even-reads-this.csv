PremierLeague,fedy47m,t3_eolj4q,1579022342.0,"You can start by calling it football and not soccer ;) 
Depends on what you identify with (e.g. history, trophies, players). If you choose a top team then you'll most likely also gain a better understanding of the Champions League and the Europa League. There's also a channel on youtube called ""onefootball"", which gives you daily news regarding certain leagues or football in general and other stuff (e.g. transfer news, discussions)"
AmItheAsshole,fedj5w5,t3_eoiv2b,1579012864.0,"NTA. Your father made it clear that he doesn't approve of your sexual orientation. The wedding is about you, you don't need to bend to traditional norms. I think your father is more concerned/angry about the potential ""damage"" to his social image than about the fact he wouldn't be walking you down the aisle. He may be your father by blood, but he sure isn't one based on his actions."

AmItheAsshole,fdxilg0,t3_en6qfn,1578769048.0,"NTA. Maybe talk to her again about the issue. She could either take a shower in the evening, reduce the time in the morning or not take a shower at all at your apartment. It's your call since it's your apartment and you're paying the bills"

AmItheAsshole,fdjvaxd,t3_elhvte,1578488679.0,"NTA. But your fiance and his friends are. Your request is far from unreasonable. His friends are AHs for treating you like that and your fiance is an AH for enabling this kind of behaviour and even ""approving"" of it since he wants them at the wedding."
dogs,fddfsel,t3_ekrn4p,1578310322.0,"Does he sleep with your daughter in the bed or alone? 

He may not be feeling well. I mean some dogs tend to avoid humans, when they're not feeling well. I'd suggest to go to the vet, if this habit continues. You may feel like you're overreacting, but at least then you know if something wrong."

offmychest,fcx41ap,t3_ejcacb,1578050282.0,"I'm sorry you had to go through that. I can understand why you did what you did. Some people have this mindset where once a person gets terminally ill, you suddenly have to forgive the person or treat them like they never did anything wrong. I understand if maybe you feel guilty? I guess to an outsider it would be considered incredibly rude, but honestly just because he's suffering, doesn't mean you're not hurt as well. He never apologised to you and I can't help but think he would've continued bullying you, if it wasn't for the illness"
aww,fcsra0p,t3_eintfp,1577923104.0,So adorable
entitledparents,fbjjazz,t3_edo7ji,1576934613.0,A bit too overdramatic and unrealistic. I hope this feedback was useful and you write a better story next time x
