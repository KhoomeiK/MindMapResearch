WhitePeopleTwitter,ffisa9k,t3_etusi0,1579981450.0,"To have a happy/spoiled dog, doesnt mean you cant train them to obey and set guidelines. And you dont have to live your life with their hair on every single item in your home.  Or claws accidently ruining furniture when they jump on it. Our dog is spoiled rotten with her own bed, (and blanket that she gets tucked into at any point shes inside) and only allowed on it in the living room and dining room, because her food next to the back door.  She knows she is not allowed on the furniture or on the kitchen."

funny,fcnbu7t,t3_ei4fek,1577808306.0,"In high school we made it to the state softball championship, we had to stay in a hotel, one of the girls hung their uniform on the sprinkler, the next morning when she took it off, the sprinklers activated, and flooded the hotel room, we were on the 3rd floor, and as we were leaving the water was pouring into the lobby.  The hotel manager was yelling at the girls from the room saying he was going to sue, coach was not having it and called the cops.   
Also because of the additive in the sprinkler system to help put out fires all the uniforms had to be rewashed, so a parent that was there had to find a laundry mat, and the girls had to do warm ups in tshirts.  
Needless to say we lost the game.... and I will never touch one of those sprinklers!"
