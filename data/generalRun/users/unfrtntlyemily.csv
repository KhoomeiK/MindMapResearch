I’m not good at basketball, and I don’t even particularly enjoy watching it anymore, but when I was 12, all I wanted was to be on the grade 7/8 girls basketball team. I would watch every game Kobe was in and try to be like him. I never made the team but I was made stats keeper (they felt bad for me). I would watch every game he played and keep stats to practise. For two years I was obsessed with Kobe and with basketball. I don’t think any other player in any other sport ever had such an impact on me like Kobe did. 

I enjoyed watching him coach his daughter, his interactions with other players, his drive, his passion. Kobe changed basketball and definitely taught me to do everything with my whole self and my whole heart. He taught me to put all my eggs in one basket when that’s your dream. Hell, I think his words are some of the reason I actually became a professional ballet dancer. I put all my eggs in that basket. I knew if I did that, I would make it. Kobe, you are sorely missed."

aww,fdnfege,t1_fdml2wq,1578584642.0,Okay I am the kind of person who will not back down from a dare. I’ve tried most [dry] dog foods my dogs have had and treats. Those ones that look like iced cookies are... kinda good? They’re just like really bland cookies. I also thought I was a dog when I was like 3 and ate dog food so maybe I trained myself into liking it.
aww,fdnf9ej,t1_fdmcm1d,1578584555.0,When my dogs don’t listen to “leave it” it’s cause they’re eating literal shit lmao. Idk why dogs like to eat poop
aww,fdnep72,t1_fdnawkb,1578584213.0,"Very true on all points! Ok actually at vet school, and we have a sheep flock, and the collies they have are SO DAMN SMART it’s truly amazing. And they LOVE to work and herd the sheep. They are very smart dogs (smartest I believe?) but I know they can get destructive/stressed if not physically and mentally stimulated enough"
