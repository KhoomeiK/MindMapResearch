OhioStateFootball,fdy20z6,t1_fdxzuhh,1578775206.0,"No issues for me personally on copyright.  Youtube has a system where the copyright holders can do 1 of 2 things.  First, they can block your video from being viewed by anyone else.  When they do that it doesn't hurt your channel at all, it just prevents everyone from seeing your video.  The second option is that they can issue a copyright strike against your channel.  It's like a strike in baseball, if you get 3 strikes in 6 months, then they shut you down.  For my videos, the copyright owners choose to just issue blocks for my videos.  Which means I can upload every week, but they only stay visible for so long.  If I was monetizing the channel at all, they would shut me down pretty much instantly.  So basically I just put up the games, and they stay visible for 1 to 3 days on average and nothing of consequence happens to me or my channel."

WeatherGifs,fdu0g89,t1_fdsjz4t,1578725311.0,"The craziest thing to me is that this thing was finally rated as an EF3 out of a possible EF5 intensity rating.  Radar showed the wind speeds as nearly the fastest clocked on earth.  The size was the largest ever measured.  However, the EF scale is based on surveys of the damage to the ground.  Given that this tornado (thankfully) occurred over a very rural area and did not produce much visible damage, the tornado was ended up classified as an EF3."

Columbus,fcz37yj,t1_fcyz7jl,1578092755.0,"Bullshit.  

1) Economy.  So we have a lot of factories making bombs and that supports the livelihoods of many Americans.  The issue is these bombs are being paid for by tax dollars and we are running at a huge spending deficit in the Federal Government right now.  We are borrowing money which we don't have.  Let's say we weren't in an endless war and we didn't need as many bombs as we do now.  So we close or slow production on our bomb making facilities.  This would result in people losing some work.  Now, do you think those people are all just going to sit around and endlessly wait for a new war to start? Or do you think they will go out and find some other work?  I think they would find a way to go work at new places to expand corporations and businesses that contribute to the economy in other, more productive, ways than killing people.  

We are writing a blank check that we can't pay for in any reasonable amount of time to try to prop up a certain industry that will continue to make the problem worse?  Yeah, that is unsustainable.

2) Environment.  So you think the carbon offset for killing Muslims in the desert is going to be a positive thing overall?  How much carbon do you think it takes to move US soldiers around the world, to manufacture weapons, and run the giant military machine of the US?  

I can guarantee you that answer is that we spend far, far more carbon killing people than they would have ever generated in many lifetimes."
