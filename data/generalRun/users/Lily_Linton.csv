I can’t remember the enough reason why the doctor needed to took it out of her womb like that,  but it really happened.  The doctor was her obygyne but the wife had an early labor miles from her. So my coworker’s wife rushed in the nearest hospital. Doctors at hospital 1 thought that they can’t do it so they called an ambulance and rushed to the hospital where her original obygyne do some rounds. When they arrived, they’re already on a difficult position that the obygyne needs to do this. I heard the wife went to depression because of it."

I heard one doctor who slipped a hand inside the woman to take that cord on the neck to get the baby out.   boy, the V never went back to original size. Oh the sacrifices these women could do."
