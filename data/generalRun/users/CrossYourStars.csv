lakers,ffbi76b,t3_esjcvf,1579766456.0,I'm a pretty active follower of the lol pro scene. Rick was incredibly popular when he owned a team and now that he no longer does he has continued to be an active member in the community. He regularly streams himself playing and tracks his improvement within the game. He is still really bad at the game but clearly loves playing and interacting with fans. Near the end of the last ranked season he managed to get promoted into Bronze which is the second lowest ranking but instead of hiding it he owns it. He has even been going to events with a shirt that has the Bronze division logo on it. He is incredibly likable and has stated that he wants to remain active in the community despite no longer being an owner.

TeamSolomid,ff9hhbb,t3_escbug,1579713114.0,"I really wish that in terms of story line, the media would have embraced more of the dark side/revenge story. Bjerg coming back to show who is king.

Like literally nothing. She can't work any other job? Shaming people into giving her money is the exact same strategy that homeless people use when they corner you at a gas station. She is streaming because it is easy, not because it is her only option."
videos,ff5cqmo,t1_ff57jti,1579587510.0,Pretty much. There is just nothing you can ever say to convince them because anything that does not agree with what they believe is instantly discounted as fake or biased.
videos,ff5cng3,t1_ff5b2ly,1579587413.0,"I touched on this in another comment but I think this is just a clear representation of what they talk about later in the documentary where those who believe the conspiracy must continue to publicly support the conspiracy theory or they risk being isolated from everyone they are close to. In that moment, if she completes this realization on camera she will be alienated from all of the people that she has spent years making connections to. So instead she backtracks to protect her social position."
videos,ff5chvg,t1_ff56trl,1579587249.0,"Well regarding motivation there are a couple main things that have been pointed to in the past and I believe that the documentary mentions both.

1. Wanting to prove the majority wrong: Many of the people in these conspiracy/denial circles are social outcasts for one reason or another. They feel that they have been wronged by society for one reason or another. Perhaps they were made to feel stupid in school or have trouble holding down a job. It really can be a million different things. So instead of learning from their mistakes and trying to correct them to conform, they latch onto these theories in order to fight against the larger society. For many of them, their dream is to be proven correct so that they can turn to others and say, ""See! I was right all along. I'm not stupid after all. In fact, I am the smartest person you know."" Because of this they can cling to these theories in the face of very convincing evidence because if they change their stance then it just becomes one more thing that they were wrong about.

2. Fear of Isolation: This is touched on near the end of the documentary and it ties into what I was talking about near the end of the last point but there is immense pressure once you commit to one of these theories that you stay committed or risk ending up completely alone. The point that is made is that if one of these major flat-earthers one day realized that they were wrong and the Earth is actually a sphere then they are faced with a difficult choice. They either admit that they have realized they were mistaken or they say nothing. While this seems like a common sense choice logically, in terms of socially it is not so cut and dry. For many of them, perpetuating this conspiracy is who they are now. If they concede that the earth is a sphere two things will happen. Society as a whole will say, ""Yeah, no shit!"" and then move on with their lives and no one will give this person a second thought. However, within their own local circles, they will lose all of their friends since they tend to only make friends with the people who believe the same thing. So if they change their point, their friends will make them an outcast and in this case claim that they have been corrupted by those in power. As such, they can feel like they really have no choice but to continue to perpetuate this false claim."
videos,ff53tty,t1_ff4u536,1579579471.0,"Yep. The flat-earther documentary on Netflix ""Behind the Curve"" illustrated that very clearly. When you would rather encase your gyroscope in a pure bismuth container to protect it from ""Heaven Energies"" than admit that the Earth is not flat, you will not believe anything that does not confirm your beliefs."
DragaliaLost,ff4zqnt,t1_ff4xbsm,1579576393.0,"That explains alot. Though I have been playing since almost Day 1, I don't pay attention to the end game meta much so things like this are very enlightening. I am guessing that this is why Fjorm is only considered good in sHBH and not eHBH or above."

videos,fe07k3c,t1_fdzxyvn,1578805157.0,It really depends on what state they live in. Many states have laws prohibiting unions or weakening them. I would never say that unions are perfect but they do a pretty good job of protecting their members from getting railroaded as you mentioned.
videos,fe072db,t1_fe05dkc,1578804753.0,"Yep. I got into teaching a few years ago because it was something that I wanted to do and I live in an area that pays them well.

videos,fe04a7p,t1_fdzz95f,1578802709.0,I would be willing to bet that there is a pretty strong correlation between these rankings and teacher pay as well. Common sense tells us that if you want the the best candidates to become teachers you need to make sure that you pay them what they are worth.

lakers,fde9m5p,t1_fde6gj9,1578334207.0,I don't think Dwight was ready when he came here the first time. He was expected to carry the team and to be option 1. That just isn't him. That is ok. Being a defensive juggernaut is still an amazing quality to have. I am just happy that both sides have agreed to play to his strengths instead of pushing him outside of his comfort zone.
lakers,fde9h3f,t1_fddk739,1578334119.0,I'll be the first to admit that I am not a die hard basketball fan. But I do follow the Lakers and the sport a fair amount.

worldnews,fde8yfo,t1_fde87ur,1578333787.0,"Based on your comment, it seems like you are from Iran. I personally always felt like it is understandable that Iran is pissed about how the US was acting before the Iran Nuclear Agreement. Many of my fellow Americans get pissed when the government tells them what to do but when Iran said that they wanted to develop nuclear power plants they were the first in line to tell the government to shut that down. Of course Iran would be upset about that. That's why the agreement was such a great deal. Both sides got what they wanted. If Iran really didn't want nuclear weapons they had the chance to prove it (which they did). I am beyond pissed that the moron who is president of my country right now arbitrarily decided to pull out of that agreement."
lakers,fdd9wov,t1_fdd4m40,1578301698.0,I'm sure that most everyone would agree that Dwight really seems like he has come out the other side and is playing with joy and passion again. I think being a role player really suits him since he doesn't have to feel the pressure of carrying a team and instead can let his defensive strengths really shine.

He said some really tasteless things to my gf (now wife) about 3 years before this happened so I stopped talking to him. After graduating from college he moved back home. One day not long after I had my first child I got a call from him out of the blue. I figured that he had bumped into my family who told him what's up so I thought he was calling to congratulate me. Almost immediately after I answered he said, ""I'm sure being a new parent is busy but I just wanted a couple minutes of your time to talk to you about protecting what is important to you..."" I ended the call pretty quickly with him. A couple weeks later he called back and stupid me thought that he realized he was being an ass and wanted to apologize but nope. He launched into the pitch all over again. That was the last time I talked to him which was years ago."

leagueoflegends,fd67xjd,t3_ejyhxn,1578186855.0,The Diablo mess was a big fiasco because of how Blizzard framed it. They built it up as a big event saying that they had a Diablo related announcement. They had to know that all of their players were thinking that it was going to be Diablo 4. It was just plain hubris that they felt that the players were the ones who were wrong for being upset. They became the living embodiment of the Principal Skinner meme. If Riot had teased TFT mobile as a League related announcement then you almost certainly could have seen similar backlash.

clevercomebacks,fcwhe15,t1_fcwdyo5,1578025676.0,"Part of the problem is that many of them focus on individual animals instead of the species as a whole. Domestication does benefit the species that is being consumed since they are able to eat, have shelter and reproduce. If they were in the wild, there would most likely be much fewer animals like cows and chickens. Of course if you focus on the individual it seems depressing. With that said, I dont think and sane person is going to argue that abusing animals is the correct way to go about it."
