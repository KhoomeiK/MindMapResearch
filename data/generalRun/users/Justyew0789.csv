AmItheAsshole,feotmls,t3_epyl1d,1579305278.0,"YTA because you keep bringing up something that hasn’t even happened and might not even happen. Do you care more about her weight or her health, bc if she’s slim and active, she sounds relatively healthy to me. She already told you she’d handle it if it happened, if that’s not sufficient enough for you, then that’s too bad."
niceguys,felxf1y,t3_ept3nr,1579233363.0,"I have a “nice guy” friend, and I find it so difficult to confront him about how he’s not actually that nice."
Chonkers,felv4e1,t1_feles2z,1579231695.0,Let me see that chonnnnnk
AmItheAsshole,fekpoal,t3_epnbxq,1579205019.0,"After your edit, NTA. Your gf is going through a lot, so I would just let it slide right now and just be supportive. say you’ll be there for her no matter what and just don’t bring up the wedding anymore in front of her."
AmItheAsshole,feju7ho,t3_epirbk,1579185950.0,"YTA. You can say you wouldn’t want it back then, and that’s understandable. You were only 19. But YTA for telling her this was her decision. You are acting like you didn’t influence it at all, but in your post you make it clear that you were the main influencer by threatening to leave. You’re insensitive to her feelings, and should have a thoughtful discussion with her stating that you didn’t think you’d be ready then and don’t regret your decision, but you are here for her and are sorry she is feeling that way."
niceguys,fejrtxn,t1_fejqq1r,1579184276.0,"Yea, I don’t get unsolicited pics often, but I have responded with something odd, like a photo of a knife cutting hotdogs. Or a photo of their mom."
cats,fei36p8,t3_ep8lcb,1579129267.0,Parrot kitty!
AmItheAsshole,fehj3yi,t3_ep0irq,1579117584.0,"NTA. When I was 21 I dated a 30 year old. None of my friends told me how weird it was, but now that I look back, I think it was gross lol I wish someone stopped me! I think eventually they’ll both realize the maturity and generational differences and they’ll deal with it on their own."
AmItheAsshole,fehiq5w,t3_ep2436,1579117359.0,"NAH. My parents met twice before they got married, and have been married for 40 years, but it was arranged and this was a different time. Sometimes it works out. I personally wouldn’t mention it to his parents without his consent. You told him your concerns and I think that’s all you can do in this situation."
AmItheAsshole,feh4f0d,t3_ep1uwm,1579108920.0,"NAH. It might hurt her feelings, but if you can’t afford it, you shouldn’t go. If she’s a good friend, she will understand. Just don’t wait last minute to tell her so he can fill your spot if she needs to."
AmItheAsshole,feeql6i,t3_eontb2,1579039117.0,"NAH. I get what you’re saying, you would rather go with her because it would be more romantic, but you don’t mind going with a friend just because you really want to skate. But, I think ice skating is a more date kind of hang out, like a picnic."
AmItheAsshole,fee3iqj,t3_eoeyij,1579025643.0,"NTA. It would take longer for you to pick her up anyways if it’s 2 hours round trip, she’s just upset bc it wasn’t you that got her."
cats,feat93b,t3_eo8zso,1578952013.0,"So much anger, but so cute"
niceguys,feanfsf,t3_eo6a9e,1578950564.0,"I like how he adds in the “lol’s” like it makes what he’s saying less offensive, what a piece of work."
cats,fe6b629,t3_enuq5s,1578885965.0,"That happened with my cat too! Would never lay on my lap or anything, and when she turned around 8, she started sleeping under the blanket with me and would let me cuddle her. It makes it that more special."
cats,fe5d3kw,t1_fe4v1aq,1578867891.0,Hope you didn’t get shredded to pieces
cats,fe4hoop,t1_fe4g1r7,1578859442.0,Her face is always so expressive!
AmItheAsshole,fe393ui,t3_enmitg,1578847143.0,"NTA. You’re not controlling or possessive, it’s respectful to let your spouse know what they’re up to, especially if they’re gone that long. I would say it’s only controlling if you attempted to follow her or tell her that she isn’t allowed to go out at all, but it seems like you’re just worried."
AmItheAsshole,fe2y6h5,t3_enm4dc,1578844149.0,"Ehh ESH. There isn’t anyway of knowing if she was racist or if she didn’t like your general vibe. You say you’re social, but your post comes off a bit hostile. Too many unknown factors to make a true judgement, but accusing people of things without concrete proof is an AH thing to do, and her being rude initially also kind of makes her an AH."
AmItheAsshole,fdqndmf,t3_emr755,1578670748.0,"NTA. A lot of guys for some reason will go right to “are you sure it’s mine?” even if there isn’t any evidence of infidelity or anything. I don’t think they get how hurtful that is, especially in your situation where he knew he was the first and only guy you’d been with. BC and condoms fail. Sorry you had to go through that, but I don’t think you were in the wrong."
AmItheAsshole,fdlglc8,t3_elwqyq,1578523573.0,NTA. I sympathize with you. He knows he messed up but figured you’d probably brush this one under the rug. Does he feel guilty at all that you got him something thoughtful and he didn’t?
AmItheAsshole,fdk9hjs,t3_elrqjj,1578499109.0,"NTA. If his phone died and he was at a friends house, he could’ve used their charger or charged it in the car to let you know he’d be late. 5 hrs is excessive too. That’s so inconsiderate, especially if you live 45min away."
IllegallySmolCats,fdi72x2,t3_elh84j,1578436894.0,What a cute chonk
AmItheAsshole,fdhl0ez,t3_elc9ld,1578424885.0,"YTA. Why does it matter what she wears? To appease my parents when I was younger, I’d wear what they deemed appropriate and then change as soon as I got in the car lol. Clothes don’t change someone’s personality or morals."

AmItheAsshole,fdespfi,t3_ekxcfb,1578345805.0,"I think you’re misunderstanding what the word natural means in this context. Her hair is naturally curly and she has to do a lot for it to make it look good. People aren’t asking about her routine, or what she did to get it there, they are just complimenting her on how pretty it appears to be. I have straight hair and if I put “curly” products in it, it would still be straight. Having hair that isn’t natural would imply she’s using extensions or perming her hair. YTA. It’s kind of like saying someone’s butt looks nice and bc that person works out, you are saying it’s not natural. It’s still natural, it just takes work to make it look a certain way."
AmItheAsshole,fd9jsh2,t3_ek67hr,1578234334.0,NTA. I’m so glad I went to school when social media wasn’t a big thing yet. All these tracking and parent snooping stories sound exhausting to deal with.
Bumble,fd9irjb,t1_fd7mpxl,1578233983.0,"Lol! Well I wish you well in your dating endeavors! A lot of mine didn’t end well, but they were funny stories now that I look back."
Bumble,fd7j97p,t3_ek7l3w,1578205395.0,"I would wait, usually guys didn’t respond to me on the weekends and I also did not go on the app much bc I was out and busy with my friends. I would get a drunk night message every now and then though lol."
Bumble,fcvhhwq,t1_fcvew2y,1578002195.0,"I agree with this! When I was on bumble, I used to get a few matches and I usually reply to the funniest/most interesting ones. Gotta be witty. And yes, attractiveness matters, but if they’ve matched with you then it’s likely they already find you physically attractive."
AmItheAsshole,fcuilwu,t3_eiwgdk,1577981826.0,"NTA. My ex had his own place, but basically lived with me bc I was much closer to his job. He wouldn’t help with any housework since it wasn’t technically “his place” and this annoyed me, which is why he is my ex lol. I don’t see how you could have any relationship at all if you don’t allow her over though."
cats,fc728n1,t1_fc6yke7,1577495596.0,Aww my cat has eaten those too! I basically have to keep everything in a drawer or off the floor. Lol good luck with your mischievous kitty
