Shipping out to a poor nation, currently under attack by the army. You try to open your eyes as you begin to understand. You can’t. The vision has started, and it cannot be stopped. You witness yourself in animalistic form kill families just trying to survive, witness his comrades dying next to him, even a few in his arms, bleeding out. You see the horrifying war go in front of you, until you see yourself stop. You look down. You can’t feel it, but anthropomorphic you can. It hit the stomach. You see yourself fall to the ground, acid leaking out of your stomach. You slowly and agonizingly die, you watch as your fellows try to save you, but there’s no chance. Acid has already flown into your body. You watch as you die. It doesn’t stop. Your eyes remain open. You watch as you’re brought back home, your body being cremated. You see through the ashes somehow. You’re put in an urn. Your family in real life unplugs the life support, giving up on you in the permanently comatose state, unexplained by the doctor.
