This [distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use%E2%80%93mention_distinction) also exists in natural languages:

Alice said, ""Bob said I won."" -> Alice won and was told so by Bob

Alice said, ""Bob said, 'I won.'"" -> Bob won and told Alice

Quoting sort of turns arbitrary text into a noun. The phrase ""I won"" is not used that way in the first sentence, but it is in the second.

math,fepfl2j,t1_fepcktn,1579319263.0,"Within computable reals, you might be able to convert between checking whether a point is inside some circle and checking whether it is inside some square of the same area.

Of course, you can't write a procedure that checks whether a point is inside a given circle.

Edit: I think I have something solution-like

Suppose we have a black-box procedure which checks whether a point (given in rectangular coordinates as a pair of reals) is within R of the origin.
The square we'll construct is also going to be centered at the origin, and it has sides of length R*sqrt(pi).
The goal is to check whether a point P (also rectangular) is in the square.

1. Take the absolute values of its x and y coordinates, forcing it into the 1st quadrant
2. Convert to polar coordinates, then replace theta with abs(theta-pi/4), forcing the point into the ""1st octant""
3. Multiply r by R\*sqrt(pi)\*cos(theta)/2, the polar-coordinate description of the square's right side
4. Convert back to rectangular coordinates

That's a computable function which maps every point inside an origin-centered square with area A to a point inside an origin-centered circle with radius A.
Use that black-box procedure to check whether the resulting point is in the circle you care about.

The sneaky bit I'm not entirely comfortable with is the assumption that the cirle we're squaring is centered at the origin, or at least at a known position.
That doesn't seem like it ought to matter, but I'm not sure how to proceed knowing nothing about the initial circle."
