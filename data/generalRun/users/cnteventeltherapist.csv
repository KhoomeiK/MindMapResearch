dogs,fgtyzb8,t1_fgtfsti,1581111232.0,"This is especially frustrating because regular brushing at home can really delay the necessity of a dental cleaning. (I would guess) the vast majority of dog owners arent regularly brushing their dogs teeth. Anecdotally, I brush my dogs teeth every day, and it has saved me money. My girl has perfectly clean teeth, but when I got her, some of them were dead. Usually, upon hearing that she has dead teeth, the vet recommends that they're pulled because of their propensity to get nasty. But then they look at my girls teeth and say never mind. When she broke one of her dead teeth (chewing a rock like an idiot) and needed it removed, I said may as well do a cleaning while you're in there. They ended up not charging me for a cleaning because ""there was nothing to clean. We just polished them to look nice."" Totally worth the $11/ year I spend on a toothbrush and tooth paste"

They were germinated in a 1:1:1 coco coir, worm castings, perlite mix, then transferred to 5 gal buckets filled with 1:1:1 cc, perlite, and dairy compost. I made compost tea with different worm castings, and watered them with it yesterday. They're really not looking good or growing as quickly as they should be. I'm not really sure where to go from here."
