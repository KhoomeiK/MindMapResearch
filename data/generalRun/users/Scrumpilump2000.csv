betterCallSaul,ff5hup6,t3_ermly0,1579593561.0,Exactly my thinking as well.  His so-called electromagnetic sensitivity is nothing other than a psychosomatic reaction to everything Jimmy.  It's kind of his warped way of manifesting his brothers' affect on his life.

Soon it would all be just a horrible, disappointing memory, made bearable only by the singular reviews put out by Red Letter Media."

personalfinance,fdcpnlf,t1_fdcog05,1578280888.0,"Medium pizza (half Hawaiian, half green peppers, pepperoni and mushrooms, with extra cheese on the whole pie) on whole wheat crust, 10 chicken wings, 2 dipping sauces (hot sauce for the wings and creamy Caesar for the crusts), and one can of ginger ale.  Throw in the generous tip of $9+ (c'mon, it was New Year's Eve after all) and there you have it!  (I had some heavy buyer's remorse after this one)."
personalfinance,fdco4qm,t3_eknio9,1578279764.0,"Ordering in as opposed to home-cooked.  I recently ordered some pizza and wings and the bill came to $55 (including tip, I like to tip generously because I know what delivering pizza is like!).  Anyway, that $55 could have been better spent on groceries."

The bigger corporations have no excuse (I'm looking at you Walmart and Tim Horton's, etc).  The Walton's could have the best employee program if they'd get off their collective arses and spread some of that wealth around."
todayilearned,fdcgjy2,t1_fd9y3bu,1578274359.0,"Well, around here the non-union industry wage has been roughly the same since my father had his business in the late 80's.  I actually make less now in the same trade as he was paying guys in 1989.  Granted, the mid-to-late eighties was a boom time for construction. But I shan't complain any further, I'm doing Ok.  But another 5 bucks an hour would be more like it, methinks."
