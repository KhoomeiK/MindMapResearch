misanthropy,ffehx4y,t3_esux4s,1579848690.0,People relate to imperfect characters because everyone is imperfect. Authors write imperfect characters because real people are imperfect. I don’t see how that’s disgusting
fatlogic,ffeh3ig,t3_esnqnk,1579847755.0,"I relate to this actually. This isn’t fat logic, I don’t think. When you’re in eating disorder recovery, you really have to disregard anything to do with having the perfect body, because our brains will twist that and make it disordered. 
Like, you can be healthy and not lean. It’s not like someone being 300 pounds and claiming to be healthy."
EDanonymemes,ffb4ni2,t3_esh26w,1579751686.0,"Fun fact about me, I developed an eating disorder and got my braces at the same time. I still have my braces. So I’ve never chewed gum in my entire ED career"
EDanonymemes,ff8cyw1,t3_es47f5,1579673394.0,I have so many questions. Who was feeding him? Why were they feeding him this? Did it make him run faster?? Was he trying to lose weight??? We’re they feeding him WHILE he was running???? How did he lose 8 POUNDS!? DID HIS INTESTINES FALL OUT!?????
EDAnonymous,ff5fy6e,t3_erqmmb,1579591162.0,"Yes, I’ve had the same experience. I think it’s pretty common. It’s better than restriction physically but it still isn’t healthy for your mind, I’ve found."
fasting,ff5fcxh,t3_erq6dx,1579590442.0,"You look amazing!! Also we have the same height, current weight, and our starting weights are pretty similar. So that’s cool"
fatlogic,ff5eolv,t3_ermqnt,1579589656.0,"This is just untrue, and it makes me angry. I’m an average  looking woman at best, who’s on the higher end of a healthy weight (although I assume I’d be considered ‘skinny’ to people like this). I do feel like I have to put on a ‘gendered’ show to be considered attractive by societies standards. This isn’t a fat person specific issue. I can’t speak for men, but most women I know feel this way."
fatlogic,fesekkr,t3_eqbzss,1579364389.0,"‘Do you completely abstain yourself from drinking and partying yourself’ um. Yes. 

I mean I attend parties, but I don’t drink or do drugs at them. 

Why is it such a unfathomable idea to this person that some people don’t drink/smoke/do drugs/regularly over eat? I just try to do what makes my body feel good long term. It’s not that difficult once you get into the habit."
fatlogic,fei9cao,t3_ep61tp,1579133190.0,"I never would have wanted an airbrushed, super thin body if it weren’t for magazines and movies telling me that was the ideal body, yeah. 
I think I’d still want a body on the smaller/fitter side though because the brain can tell that is what is healthy and thus attractive.

Everyone seems to automatically assume the OP of these posts is specifically talking about obese people but I don’t think that’s always true."
fatlogic,fegyjm3,t3_ep26oc,1579105378.0,"I saw this sign hanging up in a room when I was in inpatient for anorexia lol I thought it was stupid then too.
That being said I don’t think this is aimed at obese people"
MadeOfStyrofoam,fdp0c89,t1_fdoq07v,1578616990.0,It’s a regular kids show about a family of bugs. I vaguely remember the episode that thing was from
EDAnonymous,fdj4ukm,t3_elknca,1578458488.0,YEAH ive made my mom step on it to make sure it was accurate too. I thought this was just me

EDAnonymous,fcjgee7,t3_ehc95v,1577686633.0,"What’s weird is I’m attracted to chubbier girls, even though the idea of being chubby myself is terrifying. They are just soft and cuddly man"
EDanonymemes,fc8cb44,t3_egewig,1577531695.0,My body checks double as nudes lmao
bisexual,fc88ru5,t3_egivx8,1577529429.0,I like this but also I don’t think you can ‘dress like a woman’. You can just dress like how society expects a woman to look.
EatingDisorders,fc56s2y,t3_eg9l3d,1577446123.0,"To me, this sounds at least like disordered eating, if not an eating disorder. I would look into orthorexia. It’s an obsession to be healthy, that leads to one being unhealthy. 
I recommend seeing a nutritionist, if you can."
EdAnonymousAdults,fbo64d1,t1_fbo5pa2,1577007235.0,I’m hella jealous too! I hope you can start to feel better as well.
