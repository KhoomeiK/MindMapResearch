You're a better googler than I am... been staring at buddhas for the last 20 minutes XD"

EDIT: Eh, I'm still not convinced... the fingers are directly over the toes on the right, and on the left they're not..."

The image on the left is clearly of a very large statue (person sitting on it, for scale).

The Golden Buddha is ~3 metres tall (less than 10 feet)."

How is that any different to my Xbox 360 and my collection of Halo games that have all had the servers taken offline?

I'm not defending Epic / Psyonix here, but just pointing out that you're spewing bullshit :P

ALL software that you purchase is a LICENSE to use that software under a set of conditions; those conditions always include that online functionality can end at any time. Unless you're a software developer, you've likely never 'owned' a piece of software in your life."

RocketLeague,ffdvd0c,t1_ffdug1z,1579829857.0,"Yeah its sad.

Epic did such a good job making the Unreal Engine and making it available to indie developers, etc was awesome.

Since Fortnite got big they lost sight of what was good and are really doing awful things... as soon as Psyonix announced the transition it was bad news for Rocket League."

At the point of adding the raw pasta to the pot, they use spaghetti. Obviously re-using a previous bit of footage.

So in a way you're both right :D"
