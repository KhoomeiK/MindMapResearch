***Patu digua*** is a very small species of spider. The male [holotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holotype) and female [paratype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratype) were collected from Rio Digua, near [Queremal, Valle del Cauca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Queremal,_Valle_del_Cauca) in [Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patu_digua#cite_note-1)

By some accounts it is the smallest [spider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider) in the world,[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patu_digua#cite_note-Shear1986-2) as males reach a body size of only about 0.37 mm[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patu_digua#cite_note-3)  \- roughly one fifth the size of the head of a pin. However, there are  other spider species of similar size where only the female is known; and  male spiders are [generally smaller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism#Spiders_and_sexual_cannibalism).

OP , where do you from?\*

After a little stalk at OP: I think OP is from O Brazil, which is near Colombia. Relative to a Patu digua for sure.
