Chances are if she had to start the next client’s appointment late, she probably ran a little late with them as well to make it up to them. That might end up pushing her whole day back, but it’s likely she has time built in somewhere to make it all even out again. And even if not, it’s still her responsibility to manage her time—not yours!"
