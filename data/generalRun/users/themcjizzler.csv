Axolotyls  live up to 15 years and you will almost definitely end up with a male and female if you get 3.

I originally  started with blue Reilly,  blue dream, cherry and neon yellow. I have had births of all those colors as well as a strong light blue line, some clear and black striped shrimp, some pure black shrimp, and some reddish brown. I dont cull because  I'm not trying to breed for sale, I just like variety."
