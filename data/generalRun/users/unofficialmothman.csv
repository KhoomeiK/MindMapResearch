Psychic,ff3md91,t1_ff3kscl,1579544131.0,"Thank you so much for your words 💛 it really does get hard to keep going sometimes, when a layer of pain or whatever gets peeled back to find more layers. But I do want to try ultimately because I feel this is happening for a reason. 

It's two parts of you at war, it seems. But thank you for your advice, I appreciate it so much. It helps when it also come with people who can empathize and say what's helped them."
bipolar,ff3ijw8,t1_ff3i3au,1579541790.0,"Thank you, same to you 💛"
bipolar,fe9gocv,t1_fe9cfvz,1578937382.0,"You're not alone either!! Feel free to come talk if you need to. I do talk to my friends and they're supportive (or at least they act like it lmao, c'mon paranoia lmao) but it's not the same as someone who like Gets It. 

Yeah, apparently there's some potential issue with your kidneys with long term use? We'll see, I suppose! Apparently it also helps w suicidal ideation/self harm."
bipolar,fe8xw56,t1_fe8vyze,1578932183.0,"Yep, I lash out so much during those times, which makes me believe that I should just cut everyone off which leads for more fighting. Then the paranoia ofc, where I think everyone is lying to me and so I have to cut them off before they cut me off and it's a whole cycle. 

Good luck with the lithium!!! If my current meds don't work, that's what I'm having to try next."
bipolar,fe8x292,t1_fe8uag1,1578931974.0,"Gotcha, gotcha. I'm not entirely sure whether or not I'll carry out on this, tbh. Especially given the risk of getting sick and I don't wanna get sick during what's supposed to be a fun getaway. I've had a small amount of alcohol during the holidays, mainly so I could try out a drink my friend had made, it didn't do anything to me even if it was fairly strong; I didn't get tipsy and I didn't get sick. So it's a coin toss I suppose!! 

Thank you!!"
bipolar,fe8vd2r,t1_fe8u54c,1578931425.0,"It started off as an AP because I was verging on going manic lmao. Idk about now, I think it's maybe a mixture of both? It seems to be mainly for sleep now, though my psychiatrist wants to make sure I don't go into an up episode again. 

I haven't quite gone off; at my worst I was picking fights, felt invincible, wanted to cut everyone off, speeding, drinking a lot of caffeine, etc. The fighting with my friends was mainly because they weren't supportive of my self destructive behavior, which was valid, but of course I wanted to do it anyway."
bipolar,fe8t5m9,t1_fe8sv1u,1578930533.0,"Ugh that sucks, but hank you for this information. It's why I asked in the first place, wanna know what I'd be getting myself into. 

What dose were you taking, if you don't mind me asking?"
bipolar,fe8sxz2,t1_fe8sl1e,1578930397.0,"I take it at night, bed time. The dose, I don't think, is doing much for me at this point honestly, since I'm not sleeping much still. The version I was taking before was awful and I had such a hard time functioning.  

Tbh I'm willing to skip a dose just to have a bit of fun for a night. 

Even when I drank, and even now, I don't have an interest in getting black out drunk, just kinda real tipsy. 

I just don't wanna be sober for a bit lol"

witchcraft,fcwpkdz,t3_eixzcp,1578032711.0,"Hello ✨ I'm sorry to hear you're struggling with this, I'm very much on the same boat, though, and I know we're not the only ones, which is maybe a little comforting for you, as it is with me. 

I've been struggling my whole life, due to childhood trauma, etc etc but it's really been at it's worse for the past year and a half, especially these past months. In and out of the hospital and a psych ward, diagnoses, meds, etc etc.  And while I still very much wanted to hold onto my belief and connection to the universe and the Divine, I felt so Absolutely Abandoned sometimes, which made me feel like a failure of a witch. 

For the past few months, I've been praying a lot but barely been doing anything practice wise, which sort of deepens the feeling of failure. But I think it's something not many ppl talk about in the community, how there is a struggle and we are very human and that means ups and downs, and sometimes those ups and downs are what led us to this path (at least, it certainly was for me). 

While I know everyone practices and has their own beliefs, it's my personal belief that the universe/the Divine, etc. cares and works around your decisions. It's okay to step away and take care of yourself first, there won't be a punishment, you're no less a witch than those who seem perfecty and like they have their shit together. 

I think that's the beauty of witchcraft tbh, the ability to practice in your own way, the ebb and flow. The magic is there and will always be there for you, I do believe you're never alone, even when it feels like it.  So it's okay if you take a break and maybe only pray, or if you just have some tea, or just light some candles. Take care of yourself first, the Divine supports you and wants what's best for you; certainly that's what I've been told. 

This is very rambly and long and I apologize, but TLDR basically, you're no less a witch than anyone else, it's ok to take a break and take care of yourself, nobody will judge you for it and if they do then that's on them because you're doing nothing wrong. 

That said, I hope this helped and that your journey in recovery goes well and that many blessings come your way!"
witchcraft,fcqx85f,t1_fcqx2jq,1577893592.0,Ahhhh omg thank you 🥺🥺🥺
witchcraft,fcqwteo,t3_eiidbp,1577893415.0,"Witchcraft has really helped me get through some tough stuff, has given me a sort of purpose, and a way to connect with the universe. It primarily has made me feel that I'm never really alone in what I'm going through, even when I'm at my worst and the loneliness is crushing me. Things are still really rough and I'm focusing more on my recovery, but it's still there, I still get the little signs telling me it's going to be ok. 

Happy New year's to you I hope it's a great one 😊✨"
bipolar,fcp95zg,t3_eick59,1577854722.0,"Ahhhhh 💛💛💛💛 i'm proud of you for making it this far!!!!, 2019 sucked ass and was also the worst year of my life but we made it!!!!"

witchcraft,fckboh5,t3_ehmaem,1577721694.0,"I am Mexican and while I work with various pantheons, none of which are Mexican or of Hispanic descent, I am trying to learn more about curanderismo, a form of traditional folk healing.  This is partially where I get some herb meanings and home remedies, such as teas. For example, gastritis pains, make a tea from uña de gato, charge it and do something, chant, intention, sigil, etc. 

I'd always been interested by this, especially after I had some work done on me by a curandera, so it was definitely a conscious choice in doing so. It's not until recently that I found out that my maternal grandmother also did a bit of work with this. 

And personally yes, I feel it's important for me to use it in my practice as it helps me stay close to my roots somehow, since I've grown up in and living in the U.S.  It is also a dying practice and most of what I know is from family friends and my mom, all of which have grown up in places and times when it was more prevalent, and ofc the internet lol."
witchcraft,fc9qsiu,t3_egsl4x,1577556799.0,"Huh, I didn't even consider it. I'd been on the verge of a meltdown all day and finally broke last night. Did a lot of crying and had a combo of Seroquel and Klonopin to get some sleep, usually something like that will knock me out for a good 12 hours at least, no waking up, no dreams. But last night I kept waking up and had such vivid dreams all night and I definitely thought it was strange but didn't put a thought on it lmao."
TheAdventureZone,fbswteg,t1_fbswa1s,1577062308.0,Right!!! 😭😭😭 It's licherally so hard for me to try and pick a favorite- everyone with their own story and stuff!! But still- Clint and his characters should be given the recognition they deserve ✊🏽😔
