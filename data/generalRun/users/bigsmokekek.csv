The fact that as an adult you still think of fapping as an option to release your sexual energy is too sad for me, and hypocritical in a way, I tried to cope by saying eh I don't need girls, but I caught myself fapping and then telling myself hey I thought you don't need girls? Why do you fap then? Are you too much of a loser to get real girls? I'm just saying, if once you go on nofap and fapping doesn't break your heart, then you will never make it.

I don't have that mindset that I won't be able to sleep if I'm stressed anymore. I am relaxed at all times, no matter what it is, and keeping my cool like this probably saved my life a few times (saved me from drowning, near crash moments when driving etc).

And you won't ALWAYS be able to use it when you are a beginner, unless you are an expert meditator (having meditated for a very long time). This only happens when you can be aware on your meditation while also being aware of the outside world, if you want to block out sounds you literally have to be more aware, it's paradoxical but it's true. Basically, you need a LOT of awareness. I'm not even sure how I do it, I just feel my ears going deaf, it's wierd. I mean, when your thoughts wander and you're in a loud place, you don't hear anything aswell.

Controlling your mind is a skill which takes time, and your point of view of this world is so narrow it's unbelievable. Why do you assume everyone to have the same brain patterns as you? There are thousands of people who say their mind changed for the good with meditation and that some things just stop bothering you after a point, hence ""getting rid of bad thoughts"". The stresses I previously had I now consider small potatoes, and I ignore them just like that and they don't stick. You said ""and where do you get rid of them?"", well, if you can focus on 2 things simultaniosly then good for you, I for one have to choose whether I focus on the bad or on the good.
