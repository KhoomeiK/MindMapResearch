Fitness,ffqevnd,t1_ffqebf2,1580132519.0,There was a thread posted five hours ago where someone else asks this question. You might find the responses interesting and relevant to your situation.
Fitness,ffidzlj,t1_ffidt2y,1579971603.0,You’re not annoying me. All good. Peace. Deleted the comment as I wasn’t trying to add to your bad day.
phish,ffidwuf,t1_ffgmpe7,1579971552.0,Same. Also have freaked out during that pause at shows when it seems like Trey thinks he’s god with everyone cheering during the silence while he plays music for them in his mind (according to interviews). Whether or not he actually is god is a discussion for another time though lol.
phish,ffcstiy,t3_esx1c8,1579806542.0,Yup. Guyute always gives me a boost.

aww,ff9kh4g,t1_ff33oiv,1579714910.0,they’re real and they’re spectacular.
phish,ff9hxwa,t1_ff9a4m7,1579713398.0,"dog faced boy and bittersweet are credited to the whole band with tom marshall on dfb, but i hear what you're saying, and for all i know they could both be page-driven. i guess i think of the people who are good at writing with the band but don't write their own songs as less of songwriters than those who write on their own, but maybe i shouldn't separate the two. excellent points."
phish,ff928bd,t1_ff91tly,1579703039.0,You too. Thanks for those good vibes this morning.

phish,ff8svy5,t1_ff8e7up,1579694825.0,"as a musician who has been in numerous bands for over 25 years i understand exactly how they’re made. i don’t, however, understand what your point is."
phish,ff82qy4,t1_ff81pwi,1579664448.0,"He’d written so few of Phish’s songs as of 2004.

Edit: I think just Cars Trucks Buses, Magilla, and Army of One."
aww,ff7hmmg,t1_ff39l78,1579649754.0,"Thank you! I’ve even gotten a nasty private message about it not being a smile. Bottom line though, it looks like a damn smile."
aww,ff2tbho,t1_ff2ta1x,1579523288.0,Been making me smile for a long time now.
todayilearned,fem95ce,t1_fem8oq8,1579244356.0,Oh good. I was wondering the same thing as I’m also ineligible as a donor.
phish,fecdg5a,t1_fec50u1,1578971305.0,"Valid points, but being ten feet in front of the boys is its own type of religious experience."
LifeProTips,fduri4d,t1_fdtk8fb,1578737831.0,Towelie? Is that you?
ShittyLifeProTips,fdq6slh,t1_fdplk4l,1578657330.0,"Much better, thanks! It was a long time ago."
ShittyLifeProTips,fdpl03u,t3_emhr0w,1578631544.0,This was my secret for being super skinny for about a decade. A very nervous decade.
