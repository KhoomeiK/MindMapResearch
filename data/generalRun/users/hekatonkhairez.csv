The objective here is to limit to amount of “gutter oil”. Assuming that the production of cooking oil is the same, and no recycling facilities are created then the purchasing of scavenged oil is fine. It eliminates the potential of contamination by incentivizing scavengers to sell to a stable buyer. It normalizes the market and helps give the scavengers a stable income.

This is the same principle as what America did with agricultural products. The state helps stabilize the market, and guarantees suppliers a profit. In turn they don’t go on to flood the market, or on this case sell used oil to cooks."

You’re making the presumption that subsidization, education and disincentives will dissuade people from producing such oil. The Chinese economy and Chinese businesses don’t operate on this system. Simply because you put in place controls does not guarantee the reduction of a practise, especially in a country where financial and political patronage dominate. Moreover, many oil-hawkers have no other income, so disincentives further marginalizes them.
