A lot of it depends on the situation of the speaker community - the more remote and traditional the community is, the healthier the language is, typically."
todayilearned,ffoably,t1_ffmqxdf,1580075666.0,"There's not a clear line to draw, but there are a lot of circumstances with 'pretty much one language' or 'pretty obviously different languages'. If there's any question, mostly we ask what local people consider one language versus more than one, and if they don't have strong opinions, we'll base it on mutual intelligibility.

We've got the same situations closer to home. Where's the line between German and Dutch? Is Low German 'German', or a separate language (or Dutch)? How many Arabic languages are there? There's no good answers."
todayilearned,ffo9y6m,t1_ffmitk1,1580075532.0,No one even knows how many language *families* there are in PNG for sure. They really are that different.

fermentation,ffgwuyw,t3_etjhjh,1579917106.0,Nice! How long (and how much effort) did this take?
fermentation,ffgnom9,t3_etgzb7,1579910489.0,It looks like miso. What's in there?
conlangs,ffdlp9i,t3_et141y,1579823540.0,"Depends on how unusual the diacritics you want to use are. The US-International keyboard has a lot of the most common ones accessible via dead keys.

If you want more, you may have to roll your own keyboard, which isn't super easy in Windows 10 - the old Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator still makes keyboards that work in Windows 10, but it itself refuses to run on 10. It's easier in Linux and AFAIK on a Mac as well."
