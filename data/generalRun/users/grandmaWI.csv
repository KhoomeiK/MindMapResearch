TrueOffMyChest,fegtscp,t1_fefmo47,1579102362.0,"I was married to an emotionally abusive man for 40 years. These are the dates I have had since 2014. First guy was like hugging a lamp post. Second guy told me the wash, ironing, etc doesn’t get done by itself, third guy had 8 arms and I spent the entire time fending him off and lastly the fourth guy didn’t even get a date because he sent me pictures of girls that could have been his daughter’s age sexualized in “steampunk” outfits. I am so much better off being on my own! I am scared and wary of males because they are more apt to physically harm a woman. I was beaten almost to death growing up on a continual basis by a stepfather. I do think males have a tendency to allow themselves to get weird or focused on negative things. They also resort to anger or worse more than females. Just my almost 62 years of experience."

TrueOffMyChest,fcxo4gz,t1_fcxm7je,1578067543.0,No Troop Leaders benefit from the cookie sales.  In fact; over the years I and then my daughter and I happily gave our troops hundreds of dollars over the years so our troops could get to do more than the troop budget allowed. I sadly have had parents that stole their daughter’s cookie money. They were turned into the proper authorities. Troop Leaders have to have two unrelated people to handle the Troop Account and they must give an accounting to the core organization that every penny was spent for the girls. My daughter and I held meetings for my granddaughter’s troop twice a month instead of the traditional once a month so we packed a lot into the 6 years from KG through 5th grade we had the troop for my granddaughter. Thank you so very much for donating to the troop directly. Be assured...every penny is stretched to do the most good!
TrueOffMyChest,fcxlai1,t1_fcxfb3n,1578065683.0,Do know how difficult it is for kids to ask an adult for something? How rewarding it is to see that your efforts led to the ability for the troop to get to take a trip or help someone in need? To realize that no matter your age...you can still make a positive difference in this world? No matter what we decide to do in life...you are selling a service or product. I have seen over and over again the quietest kids gain the confidence needed to sell a box of cookies to someone. Most people realize the cost of the cookies help not only the troop but the core organization too. Girl Scout camps are expensive to maintain. If you are against helping this organization...you are free to not buy the cookies. You are free to say no. To be offended because you were asked is you being an ass.
