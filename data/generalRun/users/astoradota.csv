DotA2,ffhe1mw,t3_etmjbn,1579931454.0,"Really excited to see Alliance vs Liquid. I think panels been overrating Alliance and it gets a bit annoying how they bandwagon Nikobaby alsoLiquid beat TNC 2-0 and looking more confident every game. So i reckon its 65% chance they will win

Edit: 2-1 not 2-0"
dankmemes,ffd2lc7,t3_esvl3g,1579812179.0,Love this guy.  Was really struggling at a tech support job so binged his videos to understand so many things and ended up getting promoted and stayed with the company for 2 years

progresspics,ff5mwn4,t1_ff5luer,1579600893.0,Damn thats impressive. Most fit people i see start struggling around 8 so i’m happy i can do something impressive but 20+ is a really high number
progresspics,ff5l26g,t1_ff54vj9,1579598056.0,Its always my goal to do more reps of pushups and pullups and learning new skills as i find it more fun and interesting then weights. However 80% of my excercise is standard gym equipment.
fatlogic,fehydyc,t3_ep3ge4,1579126358.0,Whats the most convenient way to find bodyfat % ? Whats the machine called to measure it? When i see youtubers do it they went to some clinic to get a scan with heaps of other info on it but i just wanna know bodyfat %

DotA2,fdylz59,t3_enapqu,1578781252.0,Cant watch the games on stream because the terrain is so unwatchable. Way too bright on my eyes :(
fatlogic,fduwvy9,t1_fduwasl,1578740225.0,To about 68kg. Want to be around 12-15% bodyfat. May just have to include cardio a few times a week i suppose
fatlogic,fdsnpu1,t1_fdsiz9q,1578705598.0,i do weight lifting 5x a week and calisthenics daily :/
fatlogic,fdsc0e0,t3_ems7pb,1578699136.0," I \[24M 5”11\] have dropped from 95.3 to 75.1kg but seem stuck at 75kg for a month now, only lost 200grams in 3 weeks. Been on a calorie intake of 1500-1600 a week for 2 months but i don’t think i should need to go any lower.   Jeremy Ether and some other channels say do 3 weeks  cut and 1 week maintenance which is what i’ve done. (2000kcals every 4 weeks) Im eating clean and fasted till 1pm most days so don’t know what else to do about being stuck at 75kg"

fatlogic,fcws389,t1_fcwr4gq,1578035357.0,"Once you genuinely enjoy gym and learning about healthier nutrition it becomes very easy. For me it was about finding parts of many different resources and applying what i find realistic and sustainable for my life style. What i personally enjoy is Gym 4x a week cutting 3x a week on a defecit of whole foods so i can still eat a lot and 1 week a month at a maintenance calorie intake where im more free on my food choices. 

I’m a big fan of how peasants used to eat as its surprisingly very healthy and high in fibre"

DotA2,fcvumch,t3_ej3fpy,1578010469.0,Man i remember back in the days i would Pos 5 Visage and consistently have crazy good scores like 15-1-16 and my birds would just instantly kill enemy supports (Skywrath Mage always died in 1 second) then the days he was a mega tank that still a moderate amount of damage but you would kite for so long it didnt matter now he just doesn’t do anything

TrueDoTA2,fcj6q7e,t1_fcj59t3,1577678637.0,Saw that one in Dendi's pro match yesterday. Definitely very hard to notice unless you were looking around specifically for it. Wonder if they will patch that

TrueDoTA2,fc8sewv,t1_fc8qnev,1577541136.0,Oh absolutely when you get directly counter picked mid plus get ganked repeatedly and you get blamed for losing mid. I swear i get last pick huskar’d more then anyone.
TrueDoTA2,fc8qkba,t1_fc8o9mg,1577540182.0,I really feel like 5 feels so weak since everyone has too much HP due to bracers and neutrals dropping stat items. Only WinterWyvern and Grimstroke i feel like i can do damage. Some heroes walking around with 1k+ hp after 4mins
