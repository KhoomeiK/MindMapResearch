Damnthatsinteresting,fent2by,t1_fenichd,1579290357.0,Too bad he sucks.
bipolar,fdpl8ur,t1_fdp9tz8,1578631747.0,Might be a cross breed. My mau looked very similar but had the spots instead of the stripes.
bipolar,fdn8rk9,t3_em44y3,1578580313.0,I love an Egyptian Mau! They are so smart (and FUNNY).
ptsd,fdgq3lp,t3_el5w03,1578405353.0,"I feel this so hard. I spend so many mornings just sitting down in the shower when I'm trying to get ready for work and just thinking ""I can't do it today. I just can't do it today.""

isfj,fd563jb,t3_ejvre8,1578174566.0,We’re glad you’re here ;)
ptsd,fcyek4s,t1_fcyeg3u,1578078960.0,I would read it.
ptsd,fcy7rz1,t1_fcy6zjk,1578075951.0,I’m baffled at the fact that a mental health “professional” would question a coping mechanism like sunglasses. That’s one of the easiest (and most helpful) ways to stave off episodes.
Ghoststories,fcy5m08,t1_fcy54d2,1578075184.0,"Not sure where you live, but I live in the southeast United States and a lot of -suspicious activity- can be attributed to animals, so raccoons are where my mind immediately went. And they’re very smart animals."
Ghoststories,fcy5c5r,t1_fcy54d2,1578075042.0,Lol no worries!
Ghoststories,fcy2vxv,t1_fcv0yol,1578074041.0,I can’t tell the scale on the scratches but raccoons have very human-like digits.
ptsd,fcxoxz8,t1_fcw356d,1578068069.0,The light sensitivity is something that affects me a lot. A friend of mine came over to my house a few weeks ago and said “why are you sitting in the dark??”
ptsd,fcxosos,t3_ej6px9,1578067977.0,"I have trouble focusing most of the time. Your hippocampus is damaged, which controls a big chunk of your short term memory. New information leaves my brain pretty much immediately."
bipolar,fcvs05h,t3_ej16ym,1578008782.0,I am so sorry. You gave him a good life.
bipolar,fcvcrbp,t3_ej2l0w,1577999375.0,This is incredible!
NarcissisticAbuse,fcvbrpw,t1_fcv90st,1577998784.0,"I had a conversation about home ownership with my cousin at a Christmas party and my nex (and I still can't believe he admitted this) said ""I had no idea what any of that conversation was about."""
Ghoststories,fcv0da3,t3_ej1l8z,1577992084.0,Could it be from a raccoon?
isfj,fcuzpj8,t1_fcutt7o,1577991720.0,"And most of the time, people don't mind if you have to say, ""I'm so sorry, I'm blanking on your name."" A lot of people forget my name (V names seem to be interchangeable, haha) and I've never once minded when I had to tell someone my name again."
bipolar,fcumhne,t3_eivjwk,1577984183.0,That is gorgeous!
ptsd,fculhmn,t3_eii86r,1577983615.0,I'm starting therapy in about 45 minutes and I'm so nervous.
ptsd,fcul62l,t1_fctg00d,1577983427.0,Unhelpful.
isfj,fcukjkc,t3_eit6cs,1577983064.0,I'm agnostic as well.
NarcissisticAbuse,fcuad41,t1_fctnfke,1577976338.0,"OMG, are conspiracy theories a narc thing? Mine would obsessively watch alien documentaries and he was convinced the government was hiding extra terrestrial intelligence."
NarcissisticAbuse,fcua9lk,t1_fctn9nf,1577976268.0,"Totally agree. My nex shifted back and forth through covert and overt. Very handsome, very smart, but did badly at work because he couldn't get along with people."
isfj,fcu9y8x,t3_eiye1n,1577976048.0,"I'm the same way! Names are insignificant to me compared to remembering personality traits. I try to repeat the person's name back to them when they tell it to me and that helps it stick in my brain (e.g., ""Nice to meet you, Rebecca"")."
NarcissisticAbuse,fcu6hpi,t1_fcu6avs,1577973719.0,"Yeah, they target empaths, so emotion disgusts and somehow vilifies them."
NarcissisticAbuse,fcu5f2o,t1_fcu5bor,1577972993.0,In retrospect I think it’s because they didn’t expect their actions to have consequences.
NarcissisticAbuse,fcu3j1z,t3_eiuuu7,1577971521.0,"This is very similar to what my nex said to me. I think “unremarkable” and “disgusting” were the most damaging. And when I would cry after he called me names (I would try very hard to hide it but sometimes you just can’t) he would yell, “why are you FUCKING CRYING?”

How do people like this not get struck down by karmic lightning?"
ptsd,fcsvn68,t1_fcnbtfm,1577926264.0,"I struggle with this as well because I know I can’t perform 100% when I’m suffering and as Ron Swanson says, I don’t want to “half ass two things” but “whole ass one thing.” I think our brains are working so hard in fight or flight mode that our physical bodies kind of shut down."
ptsd,fcp9ypf,t1_fcosb2m,1577855628.0,I had on my headphones listening to white noise earlier and they died so now I’m just hearing fireworks.
ptsd,fcp9vka,t3_eia3x2,1577855532.0,I was just coming here to post something about this.
LifeAfterNarcissism,fcnblvx,t3_ehu2e5,1577808147.0,"You, too!!"
