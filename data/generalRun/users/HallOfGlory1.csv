trashy,ffg9kjh,t1_ffg8b4q,1579901401.0,Amazon isn't losing money. It's the business that's selling the clothes on amazon.

trashy,ff7x29z,t1_ff7wb0p,1579660399.0,Depends on where you live. Also companies get away with a lot of things they should be sued for.

trashy,ff4wma7,t1_ff4vtgk,1579574203.0,"Door and windows don't transport you to some magical land far from the protesters. You can still see and hear people. Glass doesn't stop that. It may slightly reduce it but if the protesters are right outside the door as shown in the video it doesn't make much of a difference. Also you don't allow people to fuck up your day. This isn't some video game where you can pick and choose emotions. Lastly, I never said she had no other choice. I said I understand the choice she made. I never encouraged it nor condoned it. I simply understand."
trashy,ff4v8cc,t1_ff4tlpc,1579573246.0,"No I'm not saying that. I don't know if she's a customer or an employee. I think she was in the store and maybe these protesters were chanting and protesting, as protesters do, right outside the door of the store. After the taunting she went back into the store. She obviously wasn't walking home. She was in the store and being annoyed, taunted the protesters, and went back inside. How would you feel if you were at that steak house you were talking about and the protesters were 3 feet away chanting and such at you? You're just trying to have dinner and people are annoying you. You may try to ignore them at first but that only lasts for so long until you run out of patience. I already said she shouldn't have messed with the guys sign, but I understand taunting an annoyance. Again since you seem to have missed it the first time. She shouldn't have messed with the guys sign. I have not and will not say that touching someone else's property is fine. I'm just saying her taunting the protesters by wearing the fur and spinning around is understandable. You said it yourself, let people bitch about whatever they want to bitch about as long as it isn't fucking up your day. They protesters are clearly fucking up her day. She isn't some passerby walking by the steakhouse like you, she in the steakhouse being bombarded and I for one understand her bombarding back (minus the sign part)"
trashy,ff4rxva,t1_ff4qqnt,1579570995.0,Dude the protesting is an annoyance to the people in the store. They're right outside the door.  That isn't some magical doorway that leads to another dimension. Do you think she was across town and decided to just taunt them or she was at the store and the protesters annoyed her.
trashy,ff4qo6r,t1_ff4hwh9,1579570125.0,To be honest I don't really care about that. It's just a feel good post. They poster isn't scamming people out of money or anything. It's a victimless crime.
trashy,ff4m547,t1_ff4l8za,1579566950.0,Walk past them to where? The person is already at their destination. The disturbance is happening at their destination. Their destination can't just get up and walk somewhere else. So they're stuck.
trashy,ff4jp0q,t1_ff4jhzh,1579565254.0,"Whether she's a customer or an employee, her business is in that store. Either to buy something or sell something. Unless she's just some random wanderer who goes to random stores, she's there with a purpose."
trashy,ff4jdpw,t1_ff4j8qt,1579565024.0,Dude it isn't a mobile store. They're stuck there. The only ones that can move is the protester.
trashy,ff4j5k2,t1_ff4drdp,1579564868.0,You annoy someone enough it isn't a surprised if they get tired of it and taunt you back. People outside your door protesting is an annoyance. She shouldn't have knocked the sign out of his hands but just expecting her to endure it is also unfair. Where I live if you want to protest something you're required to be across the street so as to not impede business and also to avoid these types of confrontations.
trashy,ff4cssr,t1_ff4cjmf,1579560577.0,I think they're hoping to shame people away from buying the product. Though I believe all it does is attract the type of people that revel in this sort of attention.

trashy,ff0vd51,t1_ff0nweq,1579472654.0,"The reason you're seeing more of them now is because before people used to attack and arrest them so they would stay out of sight. Now people try to leave them alone. The reason you see more being dropped off is because people are actually trying to treat mental illnesses now. Where as before you'd be dropped off at an insane asylum and forgotten. You can do a quick google search and see all the organizations that have been made to help people with mental illnesses. While it certainly isn't enough, it's still a lot more then what was available 15-20 years ago."
trashy,ff0apqj,t1_ff01it0,1579466937.0,"No it isn't. Mental disorders are being treated now more then any other time in history. The only reason you're seeing it more often now is because of the internet which let's you put a spotlight on instances like this. Where as before the mentality disabled were simply ignored, as if they didn't exist."

The crap dries out and is easy to pick up. Fresh shit smears easily and is impossible to clean off grass. I only immediately pick up my dogs shit if we're on a walk or out. Otherwise letting it dry best. (Also to be noted my dog doesn't shit the poo emoji, but logs. So there's some difference there.)"

Breath_of_the_Wild,fejcvn8,t1_fejaxet,1579167732.0,"I'm not saying rain shouldn't exist in the game or that it should just be a visual effects. It was cool to find things out like how it made certain weapons stronger. But as a plenty of other player seem to agree maybe an option that isn't be forced on anyone wouldn't be so bad. Again, it could just be something you unlock after beating the game. Like unlimited ammo. So you still played the game and felt the effect of the rain but when you're on your 2nd or 3rd run through it isn't really nesscessary. An option to make the game more replayable to a wider range of players isn't a bad thing."
HumansBeingBros,feja2hy,t1_fej5iea,1579163571.0,It depends on what the mafia did. Maybe you win some and win some more.

Breath_of_the_Wild,fej9p6a,t1_fej4j8h,1579163058.0,"It lost its charm for me. Also that's the reason it's an cheat code type you get after beating the game. Just like how games used to have things like big head mode, mirror world, unlimited ammo, etc. or how some games let you unlock ultra hard mode after beating the game once. You don't have to use the option, it's just a nice bonus gift you get for beating the game. Nothing is forced on you. But in this case BotW is a beautiful game that a lot of people simply want to explore.Maybe after beating the game you want to collect all the korok seeds or something. It's like how people asked for there to be an after game so after you beat Ganon you can explore a peaceful world."
Breath_of_the_Wild,feiscg5,t3_epbzu9,1579145962.0,"Honestly I dream of the day they release an update to let you on/off the weather. Make it unlock after you beat the game once or something. But the rain doesn't add to the fun of playing for me it just takes away. Don't get me wrong I wasn't this against it the first time I played but after going through the game 4-5 times, it just gets more annoying each time. At the very least they could've made the climber set have the ability to climb in the rain just like the thunder set makes you immune to lightning."

If i use the headphone jack the audio doesn't switch. It only happens when I'm using bluetooth headphones. I've never had an issue with the headphone jack.

When I worked at a restaurant we ordered a pallet every 2 months. Paid $450 for 84 cases of Arrowhead that's around $5.50 per case, but these were 40 ct. packs. Look I'm not saying we don't have water that's  $15-$20 but thoses are usually the name brand ""Smart Water"" or ""Black Water"" or sports bottles with special nozzles.
