The laws of the country get to decide who is an illegal immigrant and who is an asylum seeker, and they are not asylum seekers stop trying to define them as such. if they've got enough energy to get from their villages to the border, hop the fence, and get set up with new jobs they aren't starving to death. mexico isn't so bad that people are starving to death.

besides, even if they were asylum seekers they still have to go through the proper channels, unless you think america has the resources to help literally everyone in the world who is worse off than americans. if you let everyone in its just going to drain resources and you won't be capable of helping anyone anymore.

You wanna let people in who are marked for death by cartels? sure let em in if you have the resources to supply them without ruining your society.

You wanna let poor people come in just cuz they might make a bit more money? well have fun with you lowered wages for everyone and mexico getting even worse."
