And god forbid you screw with the way things are ""supposed"" to be. You have conservatories graduating musicians by the bucketload and jobs dwindling to nothing these days. 

The more narrow the focus the cattier it gets. So take the classical world with a grain of salt and like what you like. I remember a concert classical guitarist being reprimanded by an older audience member for having the using an echo effect in one of his pieces.

Why equate competition with hate? Men don't hate each other when competing. Maybe to get hyped up for a tackle. But it's temporary. Usually what results is respect. Be it someone else that's taller, stronger, faster, or more talented. 

Might that be equating competition with hate be projecting what women do to each other? In that sense you're already admitting women do compete. Only indirectly.

It's interesting that you refuse to admit women don't compete with each other. Maybe you don't as much because you're young, sheltered, and privileged enough to nurse that illusion? I don't know. I suspect you haven't entered the work force for long enough and are still in school? What I'm most curious about it is what you get out of denying it. Or maybe I'm overthinking it and you just haven't experienced enough of it to understand it exists. SO maybe it's just lack of experience with a fact of life.

But I'm old enough to notice unprecedented representation in pop culture thanks to pop music. Hollywood still needs work. Asian men weren't even on the radar 20 years ago. Alot of this is pre/post BTS. Gen Z american girls in formulative years seeing Asian boys as objects of desire is a watershed moment that asian men will reap for future generations to come.

Whoa now. We're all born with the same fear of rejection. Men either learn to get over it (a little or a lot) or be lonely. And women have no need to make that choice.

It's not like I do badly now, but that last bit of fat loss that's the hardest, where you lose weight in your face, and cheekbones start popping out, abs and what not? There's a privilege that comes with it. Like the thread reveals, women come on to you. But I was nervous or picky. You can't be too nice back or you seem desperate too. I focused so much on losing weight to get back that privilege where they just come to you. Then I finally wised up got out of my introversion and learned to flirt more."

I mean despite the fact that I’d like to hear his bones crunch under the weight of my feet, or say an F-150 I just can’t seem to muster the exact approximation.
