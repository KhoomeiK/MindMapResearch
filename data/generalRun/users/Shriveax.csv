SuicideWatch,fdchvwd,t1_fdchgqx,1578275297.0,"I checked myself into what I thought was one of the nicer hospitals in my state.

I was stuck in the ER Psych for 4 days. In a box. For 4 days. For the night I checked in, through that Friday and through the whole weekend, I was stuck in that box of a room staring at the wall. The nurses didn’t give a shit, and the only one that cared even slightly was the social worker that brought me magazines because I wanted to blow my head off from boredom. Only that Monday did I finally get transferred to the actual psych ward, and while they had a tv, I still couldn’t wear normal clothes or eat proper food.

I totally agree that it’s like a prison; except with less rights."
SuicideWatch,fdcfjjf,t3_ekmdtv,1578273651.0,I’m in the same boat fam. Cymbalta is the only thing keeping me alive at this point. Sometimes I wonder if a medicated life is a life worth living at all.
