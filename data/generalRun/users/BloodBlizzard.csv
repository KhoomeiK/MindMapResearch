I dont think billionaires have all the right answers, but I do think its commendable if they're willing to spend their money to try to solve a problem, even if the try ends up not being as successful as planned."

Showerthoughts,feu41j2,t1_fete18h,1579382932.0,When I was a teller we were allowed to stamp them only if it was for deposit only and the checked name matched the account.
aww,fefmka4,t1_fefkssb,1579059567.0,I'm pretty sure there are different options like you pointed out but I'm not 100% because we were looking to do both foster and adopt. What we have found is that they are very accommodating with your preferences so if we asked only to have adoptopable children I believe they would fly with that.
aww,fedzjgo,t1_fedmjnk,1579023190.0,"I just wanted to offer a little positive light to some of the arguments replying that adoption through foster care is like winning the lottery or that it's just constant heartbreak. My wife and I are currently going through the process and have not yet gotten to adopt but we are only about 3 months into the actual fostering and only on our second placement.  Yes, while reunification is the primary goal, that is often not an option for a lot of these kids. Our first placement was ready for adoption, the only reason we weren't able to be his forever home was because his brother had already been adopted and the family was able to also take him in. Yes it was heart breaking for us to hear the news, yes we cried, yes he cried, but we also know we made a positive impact in his life, and he also made a positive impact on us.  While you feel sad they aren't yours you also feel happy that he will have a permanent family again and the love he deserves, same thing with reunification. 

Also even though reunification is the main point, adoption is still the outcome for 25% of the cases, if I had a 25% chance of winning the lottery every time I played I sure as hell would be playing all the time. Source:

That's not to say the process is for everyone, but if you would like to adopt and cannot afford to go through an agency, or simply would like to learn more, please reach out to your local DHS, they are beyond helpful in my experience and will never make you feel like you have to commit to the process. In face a lot of the training revolves around making sure you really are sure you wanna do this.

Sorry for the long winded reply, but if it helps just one person become a foster or adoptive parent then it's worth it in my opinion."
