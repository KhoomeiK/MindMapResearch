AskReddit,ff3iu3i,t1_ff2pow8,1579541964.0,"I’ve read that over population isn’t quite as big of a deal as it’s made out to be as long as we can shift to reasonable forms of production to aid that population.

Meaning, food production and economic goods doesn’t impact the environment the way it does today.

I guess what I mean is if you solve the ecological issue, over population isn’t really a thing."

shopify,fejl3tp,t1_fejktii,1579178550.0,"You’re still thinking about the “product” first. 

Sure eco friendly products may work, but for WHO?

“We sell eco friendly products for people who ________ “

Who is a person that does something where having an eco friendly product is important for them?

You’ve gotta approach it from the other way around."
shopify,fejki2t,t3_epf779,1579177937.0,"You’ve focused on the product and not on the customer.

You’re trying to sell something with no defined audience. It’s possible, but you need a huge budget to crack any kind of ad campaign.

Start over and this time, start with a group of people, and then ask yourself... what do they want to buy? What problems do they have? What do they need?

If I asked you that about this clothing, would you have an answer? 

If you don’t know who your target customers are you simply cannot sell a product."

Now that you’ve found them, find out their other pains, problems, etc. and build another product that maybe fits a monetization strategy more easily."

shopify,fczixe6,t3_ejlm20,1578102249.0,"So here’s the deal. Facebook ads are a process. The first few thousand you spend are not going to be about sales, but instead about audience building. 

You need to build lookalike audiences.

Two specifically.

1. Those people who clicked on your ads
2. Those people who bought your product 

You don’t get those until 100 people have done those actions in each category.

Once you get them, you can target ads to your audiences and your CPC should improve as should your conversion rate.

Cold traffic is hard to crack.

If that’s too much money to spend, consider approaching social accounts or influencers who you feel share an audience with your brand (this is important, not just any influencer).

This is often a cheaper way to get initial sales because you share an audience (and therefore can skip the audience building thing)"
