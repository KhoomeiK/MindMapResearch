If you take on more than you can handle you're not only going to cause additional damage to the kid you're trying to help, but you're going to cause damage to yourself and your family...and I've seen that latter damage be irreversible.

If you have strong and justifiable reservations about being able to handle the additional workload then you absolutely made the right call.  It might suck for this kid but if it's not something you can handle then you've not only not helped him, but you've hindered your progress with your immediate family.  Saying ""no"" means there's at least a possibility that he'll end up with someone who can handle the workload.
