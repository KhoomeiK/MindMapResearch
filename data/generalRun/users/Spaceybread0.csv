socialanxiety,fenjedd,t1_fen4gid,1579285966.0,"I do have friends but I can't talk to anyone IRL. It just messes with my head, a lot. If I need to talk to them, I ask them to send me a message but like never come in front of me and talk to my face because I won't have the ability to respond."
socialanxiety,fenj601,t1_fen7n7b,1579285823.0,"Every time I'm near people I freak out and especially when they're trying to talk to me. If I try to respond, I'll blurt out something that doesn't even sound like an actual language. It hurts my head trying to talk and I keep nodding when someone is talking towards my general location and it gets tiring. I would just prefer to tell them that I don't wanna talk, by not talking and holding up my card."
depression,femon5m,t1_femomk7,1579264893.0,i don't feel well either
depression,femomk7,t3_epy9c8,1579264877.0,"um, I put 14 cuts on my left arm and 1 one my right using a knife this very week"
lolesports,fdy4b4h,t3_enc9cu,1578775981.0,"Besides Fnatic, I see only 2 other teams that may be able to take down G2 this year; them being Origen and Rogue. Origen is probably higher for me mainly because of Xerxe/Nuke jng/mid duo. Those guys should be able to crush almost every other mid lane duo in the LEC. Upset is excellent in his own right and can easily challenge the likes of Rekkles and Perkz/Caps. Rogue is a team that I expect a lot out of and I hope they can live up to the expectation."

introvert,fchz8cx,t3_eh95eu,1577655873.0,"I was travelling with my friends and some other people this summer. I was sharing a room with one of my best friends, one of the 3 people I can bother to talk to. One night, he invited some of the other people to our room to play stuff and generally talk however, I didn't want to deal with this. I pretended to be asleep on my bed while my friend and the other people played games and stuff. I dunno why, it felt so wrong but SO GOOD."
SuicideWatch,fbqsxud,t3_ee66b1,1577035321.0,"Hey, as a teenager, I have frequently felt like that and honestly, it hurts a lot. I'm extremely introverted and it shows when I have to interact with people. I do have friends but almost every few days, I suffer from a mental breakdown on the account of believing that I'm alone. I have had to take leaves from school when these breakdowns were bad. I really hope and somehow fight this but it's really hard and I feel terrible whenever I have to go through this ordeal. 

I just hope that someone, anyone, just comes to me, gives me a hug and tells me that I'm not alone but clearly it isn't true and drown deeper in my misery. 

I hope your situation is better than mine and I can only wish that you become even better."
