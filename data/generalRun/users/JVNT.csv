aww,ffaswjb,t1_ffarxcd,1579743729.0,"I think it depends heavily on what car is doing the rear-ending and which one is getting pounded.

My mom used to drive an expedition and one day, we got rearended by a golf cart and the from of their vehicle was completely caved in while we had a dent.

But, my friend got rear ended by an SUV while she was in a car and her back end was flatter than Hank Hill's ass."

Overwatch,fei0aae,t1_fehzoqb,1579127499.0,"That's not unbalanced then. If your team was in the late 1800s and the other team was around 1865, then they were close."
Overwatch,fehz072,t1_fehycks,1579126727.0,What was the other teams average?
Overwatch,fehuijw,t3_ep1n10,1579124129.0,"I look at it more as ""This is how many ults I got vs how many times the enemy killed my mech.""

If you called 10 mechs and only 2 deaths by enemy, for example, that means you were getting your ult off a good amount of time.

It also shows how well you survive after being de-meched, which means you aren't just rushing in to die repeatedly."
Overwatch,fehu477,t3_ep6ze9,1579123903.0,What were the team averages? It's very possible that the 5 silver on your team were really close to gold while the 3 gold on the enemy team were close to silver and would make the rank averages close. Gotta remember that ranks are a range. High silvers can easily be on par with low golds.
Overwatch,fehtjkm,t1_fehnrmo,1579123581.0,"Nothing is stopping you from wearing the old skins if you're a fan. My parents still constantly wear their old diamondbacks shirts (purple and teal) to games even though the diamondbacks colors are now white and red. 

Did you possibly think that could also be unfair to people who have skins from other teams who aren't changing colors since you'd basically be getting 4 skins for one purchase instead of 2?"
gaming,fe5voup,t1_fe529gb,1578875989.0,"Characters in overwatch do have a story and character developement. The game itself may not have had a story at first but with overwatch 2 coming out whic has a story mode and the amount of lore that has come from animated shorts, comics, etc, they have backstories and if people really get pissed off that soldier 76 and tracer are gay then the problem is them, not the game.

Even if it didn't, do you complain about any aspect of some backstory that they give those characters? Like when they say where they're from, what their blood type or birthday is, etc? Or do the complaints only come with they add in a fact like them being gay or when they chose to make a character of another race?

And if your complaint is that diversity is being forced, that's again a problem with you, not them. Even if they're doing it just to be diverse, why is that a problem? Why is a generic, white, straight man the default?"

EnamelPins,fdrgz0b,t1_fdr7m1x,1578684424.0,"I strongly suggest against making pins of actual items from the show like a logo unless you're doing something with it in a way to make it it's own design. If it's just the exact logo, it's just straight up infringement and ripping it off. If you've made your own design then it would fall into that gray area they mentioned.

I also suggest researching the company that owns the rights to see what their stance is on it. Some may have a record of going after people while others just let it go or may even state that they are okay with fanart like that."
MadeMeSmile,fdnyl93,t1_fdnn319,1578595480.0,"Probably 2 years and some change. Like me and my brother are 1 year and 20 days apart, so right now he’s 31 and I’m 29, but I’ll be 30 in a couple weeks. It is easier to just say 1 year than to include the days."

Overwatch,fdapl6z,t1_fdap89a,1578248740.0,"So I'm right, your choice is driven by men vs women, not by a desire to see a charity or cause funded.

Btw, men can get breast cancer too. Just saying."
Overwatch,fdanzlp,t1_fdanflo,1578248230.0,Why not lung cancer? That is actually a closer comparison to breast cancer in number of cases and has more deaths than both prostate and breast cancer combined.
Overwatch,fdahg0p,t1_fdab1by,1578246164.0,"Out of curiosity, are you selecting prostate cancer because it is something that has affected you or are you picking it because it’s one that effects men?

Unfortunately when the mercy skin came out, so many people jumped on that bandwagon and many of them were doing it not because they actually cared about the cause but because they wanted to complain about a women’s cause being the focus.

While prostate cancer is not as highly funded, it’s also not the lowest either and there are more that could use more attention then either them(for example, esophageal cancer).

Edit: And I was right, the reason is because it's a men's cause vs a women's cause. It's kind of disgusting that a company doing something for charity got so many people basically complaining that the cause they chose was for the wrong sex and belittling the chosen cause. This is also done with ridiculous claims such as men's health not being taken seriously when women are actually more likely to be misdiagnosed in many cases. Not to mention women are also taken less seriously in regards to certain aspects like pain."

funny,fckx0th,t1_fckl1ts,1577735014.0,"Just to point out, over conditioning can be just as bad as under conditioning. Gotta figure out how yours responds.

For me, I can’t use conditioner in the shower unless it’s before shampoo because any conditioner I’ve tried ( many salon quality) leave my hair too conditioned and greasy.

So I’ll condition before shampoo (it actually helps protect your hair and the shampoo will take out excess conditioner instead of natural oils) and use a light leave in after."
Overwatch,fcgig56,t1_fcfybxn,1577640353.0,"You’re incredibly sensitive if you consider the responses you’ve gotten as people flaming you.

They’re right. You’re talking about something you don’t know and when things are explained you seem to be doubling down.

There is no such thing as a bug free game. Every game has bugs or has these rare moments. Some games are more prevalent than others with them. Fixing a bug can also take a lot of time since they have to figure out what is causing it and how to fix it without affecting any intended mechanics. In addition to that, very rare or small bugs won’t be a priority since they’re affecting such a small percent of people.

In general, the devs are on top of things that have a big impact(a good example of that being when a bug with one or mercy and genjis skins which made their ult lines silent.) but they only have so much man power and need to prioritize.

The best thing to do when you find things like this is report it to them and give them any information you can about the situation to help them replicate and identify it."
funny,fcd1by8,t3_egvwv3,1577605136.0,The end is flat and holds less space which is why the tube is going to seem to empty faster early on.  It's similar to the cocktail glasses where about the bottom 2/3 of the glass holds the same amount as the top 1/3 because it's narrower at the bottom.
