IF your property taxes are more than your rent was, you are not saving money compared to renting. You are just investing in a house instead of the stock market or a savings account. Your money that was going to rent is being entirely eaten by property taxes.

This is absolutely the case in areas of Texas that I have seen firsthand. You go from a 1-2 bedroom apt for $500-1000 a month to a >300k house, you're going to pay $500-1000 a month in property taxes. It's a net loss for you, unless your new mortgage payment was previously building up in a 0% return checking account."

The issue is burning coal emits more CO2 equivalent gases AND more particles that cause health problems than any other fossil fuel or renewable. It’s quite bad for the atmosphere and humans. The whole reason they have tall stacks is to disperse the particulates and not kill the nearby living stuff.

Btw, there’s a whole study on powering electric vehicles with different fossil fuel power plants.
