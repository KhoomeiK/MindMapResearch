MEDICINE
a drug that relieves pain and induces drowsiness, stupor, or insensibility.

And further research into the definition would show you narcotics were generally meant to refer to opioids and other depressants with those types of effects. I was going to say all this but I didnt want to type too much. The use of the word narcotic has evolved to mean everything when the media and police use it, but I'm not sure if in terms of legalise you'd have to specify between depressants and stimulants. Many may hear narcotics and only think of medical depressants, pain killers etc., but not necessarily include things like crack, marijuana(despite it having similar effects) and such. That is why that other person may have insisted that drug arrests dont necessarily automatically mean narcotics"

Or maybe he didnt even ask and his just going of his own ignorance. I am skeptical he was capable of coming up with a quick he said she said trap like that in the spur of the moment, although it *would* be easier and more true to character that he would just think up he could lie about it afterwards."
news,ffizgux,t1_ffikk7e,1579986548.0,"Also, knowing how police work when defending their mistakes, drugs can be vaguely referring to anything from weed to prescription meds to hard drugs. Sure if it was the later maybe the parents have some ~~steak~~stake in subjecting their family to scrutiny that can lead to this danger, but ~~their~~there is a reason police are expected to carry out their work in a specific manner and the failure of the system to enforce meaningful consequences on police that fail to maintain discipline is not going to help civilian and police relations."

news,ffbhyuy,t3_esfi6e,1579766147.0,"I have to see what this looks like. This sounds so unreal. The description giving in the source article linked in OPs is frightening. They say the other children look to be ok, but I am certain they are not. They are all home schooled, I have no knowledge relative authorities may have in general about how child abuse cases can present in these types of extreme cases and I'm only using some personal assumption from various things I've heard about things like this, but I fear that he was possibly used as an example to the others, perhaps to get them to behave as the mother wished and to keep them in control. You have to imagine that of the children were exposed to the outside world at all evenif just via tv if not so especially via tv, the children would have to have and idea something was not quite normal in their family even if they were conditioned to believe so. They would have to let it slip, so we have to imagine the leash this woman kept on these kids was extremely tight. Or maybe it's a similar situation to the one that was made into a movie except somehow she ended up with multiple children instead. If the boy was the oldest, the following children could just be convinced he was extremely sick. They'd have no context nor be given any to what real sickness with any proper treatment at all might look like.
