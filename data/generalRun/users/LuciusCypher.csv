He’s not needlessly cruel but as I said, he doesn’t fudge his dice and his enemies do have a sense of tactics. Fucking goblins and their constant disengaging nearly killed me at level 2 because they just rush passed the party Paladin and went straight for me.

Jesus however aint having none of that fake shit. A fig tree has to produce fruit: if they say they do but they don’t than obviously that fig tree is a fake and just waiting for it to produce fruit when it has never done so before I a waste of everyone’s time and investment.

dndmemes,fefs7df,t1_fed5cty,1579063630.0,"I'd say it would work. Pretty sure this is more or less extortion.

Let's say there is a gang of goblins big enough to wipe out a village. A group of morally-ambiguous adventurers could intimidate the village into paying them to kill the goblins, or they could just skip town and let the goblins destroy the village. Technically, the adventurers aren't threatening to do anything to the village and is in fact doing the opposite: they're threatening to do _nothing_ and letting the villagers face their own fate.

A somewhat less morally ambiguous one could be something like how a paladin might threaten an ignorant/racist NPC to go get help from someone they would normally hate, because if they don't the fate they'll suffer is far worse. For example a paladin intimidating a king that if they don't get help from the neighboring elves, his kingdom will be overran by undead. I would say in this instance that the paladin is using intimidation not by threatening the king directly with harm, but by emphasizing the threat of the undead, in order to convince the king to do something he normally wouldn't want to do."

dndmemes,fecj4nr,t1_febvfgc,1578975167.0,"The issue with that is that I feel too many players and DM's associate any sort of intimidation check with violence, and thus effectively end any actual attempt at talking things out and just rolling initiative.

dndmemes,feciudh,t1_fecgc7n,1578974970.0,"Acts of violence can certain be intimidating, but intimidation being limited only to threats of violence will make it fall flat in situations where the NPC isn't threaten by violence. Stuff like trying to question an enemy soldier, or a merchant surrounded by his mercenary guards, or even an undead being who comes back to life from death. In those instance trying to intimidate them with violence alone is quaint at best, and useless at most.

Not to mention at that point you may as well just not bother with intimidation and just focus on say, combat abilities, if all your intimidation boils down to is ""hurt them until they comply""."
dndmemes,fecilh9,t1_fecho4d,1578974804.0,"Reporting someone to the police is not explicitly violent, but it can certainly be intimidating. Blackmailing a cheating husband to his wife isn't immediately or even physically damaging, but it is still intimidating and can harm him without ever needing to draw a weapon or even tough them.

Heck even something like withholding someone's payment can be used as an intimidation tactic, or being ostracized by society. The important thing about intimidation isn't the threat of violence, it's validating being in a position of power. A lawyer with a brief case can kill more people than a man with a gun, and that is because of the power they wield, not threat they pose.

More importantly, players and DM's alike got to stop associating intimidation checks with initiative checks, because it seems like any time someone calls for intimidation people need to get ready to start throwing fireballs and calling for the guards even if all they're doing is accusing someone of their crimes."

As a PC I know all too well that my life is quite fragile expecting good luck and a heroic motivation to be sufficient against sheer raw stats will result in me rolling up a new character. And so I must be clever to avoid danger or to defeat my enemy, which leads to the second issue: sometimes my actually good plan utilizing proper tactics, actual mechanics, and very little home brew or rule lawyering may break a scenario which shouldn’t happen, all because I know I’m weak and thus I need to plan how to fight or flee by any means necessary.

As a DM I of course want to make my world feel like a world and exist outside of the players own perception. Legendary heroes of yore that they can see and even interact with, ancient threats that require a whole campaign to counter act, people of all sorts of different beliefs, views, and cultures.

dndmemes,fe1b121,t1_fe19pgf,1578824539.0,"There are two ways I go about it personally: in-game, I will often create a mentor/experienced NPC who can help give guidance to newbies about certain threats. Stuff like “make sure you diversify your damage types, lotta enemies resist physical damage” or dude’s who can give hints or advice for certain enemies.

Out of character, I try and let my new players get a feel for their character with a few sessions and allow them retraining if something isn’t working for them. I often do this for casters who regret certain cantrips choices (diversify your Damage types). This way when you do throw a variety of threats at them that isn’t just a bunch of goblins/kobolds/bandits on an open field, the new players will learn they do need to be more considerate of their options."
dndmemes,fe1725s,t1_fe1482e,1578823274.0,"Aye. It can be a difficult road to travel. Obviously as a DM you want your players to have fun, and making them suffer the consequences of their nativity is not fun. But at the same time you can’t spoil them constantly by giving them easy fights or always pulling your punches, because then they’ll get complacent in their abilities and take it more personally if they really can’t win by sheer brute force alone. 

And the worse part is if you’re a DM who occasionally gets to be a player. Metagaming as a rule is a bad thing, but when you’re a forever DM long enough you can start picking up hints of when another DM is putting in the kids gloves or pad out a fight. Worse still when they use a monster you’re familiar with and either are avoiding using certain abilities or adding new ones."
dndmemes,fdzqefc,t1_fdymqio,1578793387.0,"In my experience, it’s impossible to balance encounters even if you only use what might be given in a prefab module. Bad rolls or bad decisions will always make a straight forward battle into a fight for ones life, just as well as a few lucky rolls for the players can end an epic fight in one or two turns.

As a DM I always stress that not all battles need to be finished to be won. Surviving an encounter with a young dragon as level 3 characters can be as rewarding as slaying it, and you’re more likely to survive if you don’t think that every fight is one to the death. 

Just as well of course, you also need to establish from the beginning whether or not you will play fairly or favor the party. Obviously intentionally fucking them over as a DM is just shitty DMing, but at the same time unless you’re trying to go easy on players, you can easily play fairly and still defeat your PC’s with legitimate tactics and abilities, or just utilizing their over confidence. If you got some dumbass Barbarian thinking he can 1v1 a Mind Flayer, you can either do the fair thing and have the mind flayer dominate the barbarian’s mind to make him fight his allies (because that’s what a mind flayer would do), or go 1v1 against a barbarian using nothing but his tentacle attacks (weird for such a cerebral creature to basically be brawling with a warrior type)."

If it’s berserkerlot, I imagine that it’ll just be Fate/Zero all over again, though it’s a bit of a toss up for how long he lasts. But as the berserker, he’s definitely going to be out by the time Gilgamesh shows up, if he doesn’t go down in the same fight as  Herc for whatever reason. Shinji Def will have no control over him once’s Zerkalot gets his sights on Saber.

If it’s Saber Lancelot though I think that would just create more drama. Assume he has no memories of Fate/Zero (which is probably the default since the memory stuff in FGO happens only in FGO, with a few specific exceptions), he might still reluctantly go under Shinji’s command for the sake of Sakura, but he’s definitely going to be planning on how to save her in classical White Knight fashion. And even if he should find Saber, I’m also sure he will use his “For Someone’s Glory” NP effectively this time to mask his true identity even towards Saber.

In that hypothetical route I’m certain it’ll play out similarly to Lancelot’s fall in classical tales, with him trying to do what he believes is right on his own but ultimately failing in shame and dishonor. On the Heaven’s Feel route where he doesn’t have to work under Shinji, both he and Shirou must confront their ideals and realize that despite the apparent nobility their desires can and do cause suffering, and must decide the fates of everyone’s happiness against their own code of honor."

Alignment should've always been descriptive, not instructional, especially since even a dimwit can have particularly complex feelings about actions and their morality that can make someone who is good seem evil and someone who is evil seem good.

For example using this comic, Mindreaver uses Mind Control on the violent villagers to protect the magic girl. In the context of that story, Mind Reaver is good. But break down some aspects of it and you might think he is still evil, or should be. Mind Reavers as a rule of thumb are rarely benevolent, Mind Control is often seen as one of the more terrible forms of magic, and for some people magic is bad and a girl with magic can lead to disaster.

The point in this rant is that the Mind Reaver is hardly what would be narrowly defined as Chaotic Neutral, if that in it's own paradoxical way can even be strictly defined. Even it's generally accepted simplified explanation of ""I do what I want regardless of what others want me to do"" is still entirely vague enough that it can swing all over the alignment chart. The guy is straight up _good_. Nothing about his actions are particularly chaotic beyond perhaps his methods, and that's only a stretch in so far that they're not polite.

Nor was he particularly seduced by any powerful forces from beyond, be they dark or divine. Nah his motives were entirely mundane and downright human: he simply wanted to make money in an easy and ethical way (he did sign contracts with the soon the be dead dwarves to use their bodies).

It wasn’t until he let his greed get the better of him that he began to fall. Tax evasion man, tis the slippery slope to some truly heinous crimes. Next thing you know he’ll try to run for a seat in government and offer foreign third-world nations loans and infrastructure assistance to catch them in a debt trap."
pcmasterrace,fd7sljc,t1_fd7ra3j,1578209454.0,"It’s a vicious cycle I think. As ad blockers get more and more common or built into the browser, the more intrusive ads become in order to bypass said blockers, or something like that. It’s not as if people are choosing to support ads that are viruses, but in response to those who do use ad blockers, people who design ads have to be more aggressive on those who don’t use ad blockers to generate more clicks, whether they want to or not.

One particular nasty ad I see a lot on mobile is where the ads expands around the edges of your screen. Top, bottom, and sides, eating up like 1/4 of your phone screen just to show off some sort of fancy background. It only stays up for a few seconds but because of that it doesn’t give you the option to exit out of it, and it can often _wait_ a few seconds after the page had loaded before expanding, increasing the chance that you might accidentally click it as your scrolling or selecting a link elsewhere. This is the type of ad I’ve noticed in TV tropes. Worse still even after it shrinks, it’ll still create a banner at the bottom of your screen with a tiny X to be more of an ass about getting rid of it.

Hard part is that getting ad blockers to work on my phone is a crapshoot. I’ve tried a few I’ve seen on Reddit but they’ve thus far been a busy or ended up compromised. Or worse, some websites would have ads built into their stuff, like how reddit mobile would have advertisements locked as their own posts so they end up on my wall even if I don’t give a shit about what they’re trying to sell me. Or when you watch a YouTube video and the YouTuber talks about their sponsors."

dndmemes,fd7mddx,t3_ejy0u0,1578206693.0,"I gotta ask, what is the difference between a rule lawyer and a meta gamer?

Like seriously, whenever I read some story about people being butt hurt about rule lawyering, it sounds more like the player is just meta gaming. Usually it’s something like “this monster doesn’t have that ability“ or “they only X amount of AC”. 

The closest I can think of Rule Lawyering stories is usually whenever the DM gets called out for some sort of unspoken rule skip like a mage casting two non-cantrip spells in the same turn or something, and even that is mostly along the lines of the players knowing no existing monster or player ability grants such power. And even then those specific cases tend to have the DM press the “this is a home brew” button.

I’ve seen people also call players rule lawyers when they try to bend a questionable combo with vague interpretation or select online support (see: anytime Crawford gets quoted), but that sounds more like being a munchkin than a rule lawyer."
pcmasterrace,fd7kuxh,t1_fd7jzov,1578206064.0,"One would think, but even websites as normally harmless as say, TV Tropes, are starting to have annoying pop up ads that aren’t ads but some sort of virus or whatever that gives my Anti-virus conniptions. And yeah, I also go to places where I can pirate Tv Shows and Anime too, and porn of course, and even reputable places like Pornhub can cause annoying pop-up ads that themselves try to intrude into the system.

Websites like those don’t need my ad revenue anyways, and so UBlock Origins, pop-up blocker stuff, heck even no-script if it’s not compromised (though I think it is, haven’t downloaded it on anything but my laptop). If I really like the content of support via other means than ad revenue. Buying merch, membership, or Patreon. But ads? That’s too much of a commitment."

Solid refers to the fact that it's not hollow, which is sorta obvious considering the material is so thin and we can see right through the ring.

todayilearned,fcyvng6,t1_fcyut3y,1578088073.0,"Being able to do a task you’re assigned to do, especially not a particularly difficult one, is not the same as raising someone into servitude. Not like the girl is making toys in a sweat shop; as long as it gets done doubtful anyone cares for the actual quality. The fact she ends up doing most of it even though her uncle is suppose to help her is that particular issue.

And if you don’t want to help, that’s fine. As a kid they can choose to be useless shits and they’ll be cared for. But taking that mentality into adulthood doesn’t create a strong independent person who is their own boss. Rather it creates someone who doesn’t do any job that they can’t accomplish within their limited skills and education, if they have any job at all.

If people are miserable these days, it’s because of the opposite of what you say: they were given the naive promise of their hard work would result in them getting an easy life where they could do whatever they want.  It the reality is that they won’t get that life, or at least the probability is low. Now they’re stuck with the shit jobs assigned to them because they wanted to do something more important with their time, and found out that the most important thing they can do is do a job someone asked them to do."

The kid has likely been assigned, much like the uncle, to paint those ornaments regardless of what they were doing or if their interest. Maybe the girl doesn’t want to paint either.

A place people can go to say “that is wrong”, everyone to agree, and then proceed to do that thing everyone says is wrong anyways?

I get that the UN isn’t meant to be the world police, but what benefits do that provide in the event of major powers doing majorly dickish things to other lesser powers?
