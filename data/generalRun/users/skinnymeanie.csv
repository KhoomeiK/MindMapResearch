No, you don't."

fatlogic,ffcuihx,t3_esos5i,1579807527.0,"I always have a hard time visualizing this ""joyful movement"". I always picture people sitting on chairs arranged in a circle throwing their arms up in the air while joyfully giggling.

Same with ""fat shaming"", where I picture 5 to 10 skinny middle schoolers dancing in a circle around one obese middle schooler and singing ""fatty, fatty, two-by-four"" or some crap like that."
fatlogic,ffctuso,t1_ffby1nq,1579807146.0,And let's not forget that the vast majority of humans is not American.
fatpeoplestories,ffcrhxj,t1_ff3s08t,1579805756.0,"But not ""really, really short"" as he said. There are still many American men in the 5'4"" - 5'7"" range."
fatpeoplestories,ffcr5ns,t1_ff5iey5,1579805548.0,"??? 5'9"" is literally average. Stupid chicks - no loss there.

I've once told a guy that he was too tall for me (about 1' taller than me and also a jerk, which ruled out dating him anyways). He told everyone he knew and I caught hell from pretty much all men over 5'8"" he told. I guess height selectiveness is only socially acceptable when in favor of taller people."
fatlogic,ffbas09,t1_ffaxy3o,1579757780.0,"I've seen this kind of thing too, every once in a while. But I wouldn't even try to get her to get up, since people who do this are likely either homeless, on drugs or alcohol, mentally ill, plain assholes, or any combination of these - better to just leave her alone."
fatlogic,ff9y5ag,t1_ff7004d,1579724030.0,"There is no healthy way to manage your weight as maintaining means restriction and restriction means eating disorder. You need to continuously increase your weight, everything else is problematic diet culture."
fatlogic,ff9vt09,t3_esewhu,1579722600.0,"Overeating is the real problem. The overwhelming majority of dieters end up quitting the diet and resume overeating, gaining back all they lost and more. An overabundance of cheap, calory-dense food and an expectation of instant gratification is the problem."
fatlogic,ff3hp7f,t3_eqlpqk,1579541267.0,">Someone who has been both average and obese

Since the average these days is overweight, does that mean she has always been overweight and obese? Doesn't sound like ever having been at a healthy weight."
fatlogic,ff3gxz1,t3_eqlpqk,1579540805.0,"Exactly how long should one stand there and hold the door open? Until 10 people went through? Until more fat people than skinny people went through?

I thought you only hold it until the next person can grab it, unless it's someone disabled or very old, or someone pushing a stroller."
fatlogic,ff3frol,t3_eqyanm,1579540146.0,"If they consider fat people's lives more riskable that thin people's, why don't they just risk anesthesia for 400+ lbs people to perform surgeries that supposedly only thin people can get? Could it have something to do with NOT risking a fat person's life?"
fatlogic,fessdg9,t1_fejsse0,1579368528.0,"You think that's crazy, what about 30DD pushup? Yes, they exist and a salesperson tried to sell me one."
fatlogic,fesrlyv,t1_fej21an,1579368288.0,Simple sports bras that don't have the unaboob appearance.
fatlogic,fesr7la,t1_fejvayq,1579368156.0,"You are actually very tall (5'8""), about 10cm (4"") more than average. Standard women's clothes are usually based on a height of 5'6"" or less. That, and it appears rather short skirts are in style in recent years."
fatlogic,fesmpre,t3_epu9dz,1579366870.0,Setpoint? The sum of the weights of body and mind is a constant?
fatlogic,fesmcpq,t3_epwfvv,1579366755.0,What an ignorant ass. The decision between gluten free or not is literally a life or death decision for some people.

fatlogic,fe2jcup,t3_enn6kd,1578839060.0,Wait a minute - I thought it was fat phobic to NOT have sex with fat people. Now which one is it?
fatlogic,fdxsa8r,t1_fduz4yp,1578772423.0,Congratulations on your weight loss.
fatlogic,fdxfnry,t3_en29tf,1578768268.0,"By the age of 16 almost all girls are way past pubertyand an American Eagle size 0 is huge. Though one from years back might still be smallish, but not super small unless it's from 20 years ago."
fatlogic,fdr2zzj,t3_emudqk,1578678809.0,"Maybe the coveted ""Thin Privilege"" keeps thin people alive longer?"

You can't be a good, reliable parent/partner if you are called to various remote work sites at a moment's notice and for weeks at a time. If you value that kind of life don't get romantically involved."
fatlogic,fcy7uwr,t3_ej6o9x,1578075993.0,Maybe to calculate the exact dose of a drug you need? A lot of that is weight dependent.
fatlogic,fcy6c5q,t3_ej7f9p,1578075394.0,"No. We live in a culture where next level gluttony is common, widespread, and often expected. Considering this to be normal and assuming a poor me attitude when it comes to consequences, while there are still so many people in the world who don't get enough food - that's what's truly insane."
fatlogic,fcxvk7r,t3_ejgukk,1578071134.0,This is not how this works. This is not how anything works.
