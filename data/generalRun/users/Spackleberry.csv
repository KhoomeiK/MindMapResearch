AskScienceFiction,ff2i6vv,t3_er68vu,1579507222.0,"I have to disagree with the “Vader will take over” crowd. Vader’s political and military authority relies entirely on being Palpatine’s apprentice. Based on what we see, the Imperial High Command hates Vader and the ordinary soldiers fear him. Almost nobody would follow him willingly. Sure, he is individually powerful, but the galaxy is a big place, and he can’t pilot a Star Destroyer on his own. And he sure as heck isn’t a politician. He’s a murder machine.

At best, Vader retreats to his fortress on Mustafar with a handful of loyalists and either continues his own studies or awaits an offer from a Moff to be his lead enforcer.

Without Palpatine as a unifying force, the Imperial remnant collapses into civil war. Moffs declare themselves overlords of their own sectors, whole star systems declare independence or join the New Republic, and a never-ending stream of puppet claimants to the throne pop up and get deposed. The equivalent of Palpatine’s cabinet either dissolves or flees Coruscant and tries to establish a government-in-exile.

So maybe a few Moffs decide that they think they can control Vader and offer him a position with their forces. But Vader does not play well with others, and only remains loyal as long as he can indulge his desire to kill rebels. Maybe he tries to pull a coup d’etat or two, but ultimately, without the loyalty of the military any attempt at rulership will collapse."
