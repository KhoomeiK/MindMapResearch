AskWomen,fefll7c,t1_fef7i5e,1579058932.0,Cliche I know but love yourself first before you let anyone else in.. pun intended too lol. I lost my virginity at 29 and had my first bf at 30. I lost 40 lbs so that I can get rid of my virginity and it wasn't as life changing as I imagined it to be. It would have been more special with my boyfriend right now.
