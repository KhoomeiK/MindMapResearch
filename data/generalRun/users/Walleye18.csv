hoggit,fdm2r5h,t1_fdlza7p,1578538419.0,"Yes, for two reasons.  The first is that most of their tutorials have incorrect information or such a lack of information that they’re essentially useless.  Secondly, they spam so much content that it masks users who actually put time and effort into researching their tutorials.  So every time someone tries to go to YT to learn something, it’s harder and takes longer (so to speak) than it needed to.

Seems like a casual group having fun and that’s cool, if they’d just stop with the “tutorials” I’d bet the community would have no issues with them."

Having used Saitek products for awhile during my earlier hotas days I can say they’re not bad, but they’re not great either.  After a year you’ll get spiking and need to start upping the deadband, parts will start to wear and you’ll get sticking.  Not saying the saitek was all bad, they were pretty good for the price, but I wish the 1600 was available back then ;)"

My point was that Cdn healthcare isn’t free, to the contrary it’s quite expensive and in comparison to the US for instance, it sucks, and takes forever to get anything.  Even after paying an arm and a leg in taxes, a bunch of stuff like medication isn’t covered so you still gotta pay for that.

But what’s to be expected, like everything else handled by government bureaucracy, it’s a dumpster fire of waste and incompetence."
