Battlefield,ffdtzgu,t1_ffd7bxd,1579828877.0,"BF3's movement mechanics are underrated.  I loved BC2 from a map design perspective, but man, the movement was ass.

BC2 had well thought out cover and map design (well, until you destroyed all the trees) and very well balanced gameplay (arguably the only balanced game in the entire series from both a class and weapon and vehicle perspective).  but the actually mechanical aspect of playing needed refinement.

&#x200B;

BF3 delivered on that, its just too bad they introduced bad faux-realism mechanics like tying bullet damage to caliber and the suppression mechanics, and went back to their old ways of poorly thought out flag placement (and going further by shoving Rush into the conquest map templates.).  I also think flipping the ammo and medkit responsibilities compared to BC2 was a bad idea.

I felt absolutely trapped at work, crawling inside of my head to get out, finding every excuse not to be there, and feeling absolutely no motivation to do anything while at work.  but when I was out of work, I didn't do anything else, either. 

I dreaded every day because I did nothing every day.  and then I recognized what was happening to me, and I still didn't care.  my lack of sleep go to the point where i'd fully dissociate or black out while driving home (couldn't tell you which was happening, because I wouldn't remember it.  and it wasn't highway amnesia either, it was a pattern I could predict based on my sleep patterns, and happened in city driving and over short distances).

>As for your claim about the relationship between militias and weapons that is historically incorrect. 

well i wasn't making the argument based on history, i was explaining to you how that phrasing worked.  by the way it's worded, you cannot say that the bearing of arm's requires a militia.  it doesn't.  if you're going to argue that that's the intent of the phrase, that's fine, but as written, that's not what the document says.  it may be poorly worded and have been intended to carry a different meaning, but as written that's not what it says.  I was just explaining to you how that wording functions, it had nothing to do with how the document had been interpreted in the past.  

>The right to bear arms has only recently been recognized as an individual right in 2008 and 2010 with the cases Heller v. D.C. and Chicago v. McDonald, beforehand this right was restricted just to the states.

1) the individual right to bear arms was only officially recognized in 2008, that is correct.  but was never said that the right didnt exist prior, not on a federal level.  That decision wasn't a reversal of pre existing federal policy, it was a clarification of a right that reversed policy at a state level.  the right wasnt restricted to the states so much as the states were just given full license to restrict or not restrict as they wished.  

2) both those that believe it is an individual right and those that want to go with the militia interpretation have only that: interpretations.  there is no consensus on what the intent was and there never will be, and the document is admittedly vaguely worded. neither you or me is ""right"", we're just taking interpretations of the words of long dead people.   the opinion of people in the past and people now will vary because there isn't a ""right"" answer here.

3) the interpetations of the intent by current and past supreme courts is both fluid, and has no bearing on how the phrasing is actually presented.  you cant argue that the wording requires someone to be in a militia to bear arms based on the wording because that's not what it says, period.  that isnt for debate.  the only thing that can be debated is intent."

collections aren't a functional purpose.  they exist for personal enjoyment and outward show.

there's nothing functional in this past the movement, which is itself needlessly complicated on purpose.  there's no practical reason to carve a casement out of sapphire.  its MADE as a flex and bought as one.  its  cost is so far past what the movement is that you cant really argue its about the movement at all.  there's a lot of tourbillon watches out there.  you could argue that a tourbillon watch is frivolous in and of itself.
