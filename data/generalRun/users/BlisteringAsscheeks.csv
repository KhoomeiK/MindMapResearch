As an American, that got a good belly laugh out of me. In addition to being ironically false, it is also SUPER condescending. Sounds like they're saying ""We superior Americans don't worry about such silly stupid things, but those dumb Irish - what're u gonna do?"""

Just writing for the craft of it and seeing how good of a product I can make by writing and re-writing and editing, for my own amusement and to hone a skill. Through just that alone I feel like I've learned a lot. And one of the biggest things I've learned so far is that sometimes you can get scared of your own work. That the next part you write will mess it up. And the only way to get past that is to stop thinking about it and just start writing SOMETHING, even if it's crap. Because maybe in that crap there will be a small gold nugget, like a phrase that you like, and after that, even if you end up erasing all the crap, the small gold nugget will be a fertile seed for a mountain of gold. (Maybe more like, fool's gold, at my crappy level, but still, something that I'm at least satisfied with.)"

wholesomememes,fee1s99,t1_fedpjlk,1579024608.0,"Like all things in life, it's a balance. It's a bad idea to depend on others completely for your feeling of self-worth, because if they leave you have nothing. Ideally, you would start a relationship on a solid foundation of self-love and confidence so neither party is unhealthily dependent. But there's nothing wrong with a partner supporting you and making you feel even better about your self - in fact, that's what *should* happen. And on a more out-there note, though ideally you would start a relationship with a solid feeling of self-worth first, it has been known to happen that a person developed that through a relationship. It's not advised, because you risk becoming dependent on that person, but ultimately a relationship is just a concentrated form of a 2-person interaction. There are plenty of people who initially learn to develop their sense of self-worth from a mentor or friend, and it just so happens that sometimes this person is also their romantic partner. Again, you shouldn't depend on a relationship ""fixing"" you, but if it happens, it's not a cardinal sin like some people in this thread are making it out to be. My advice if you find yourself in this situation is to personally work on making sure that you are letting the relationship shape you for the better but that you take that motivation and make it your own so that you are being your own person who is improving in the context of a relationship, and not a relationship-member who is improving because of the relationship."
