War may be occasionally necessary, and a military is too, but that doesn't make either glorious or noble. A person who kills is a murderer whether their government tells them it's OK or not, and the individual must live with that the rest of their lives.

I do very much want MY government to step in. Asking our ""friends"" to change ain't going to cut it. We need the power of law enforcement and/or the military to step in to confiscate the 1.2 guns PER PERSON in the US.

politics,fezfyk2,t1_fewjo6n,1579456912.0,"1. No, I'm not simplifying. OK, fewer guns means less *gun* violence. Guns are much more efficient killing machines than knives, baseball bats, frying pans, fists, etc., and they offer the shooter a safer, more convenient, less gruesome (for the shooter)  way to kill. Wounds from knives, baseball bats, frying pans, etc. are generally more survivable than a gun shot -- ergo fewer deaths.
2. Of course. I used ""defending my home"" in the broader sense -- my neighborhood, my state, my country. 
3. I am NOT a gun lover. I grew up in the south and had experience with guns, owned a few, and had fun shooting bottles. Then I grew the fuck up, realized that the NRA is an evil organization out for money and power, and that pseudo-military weapons, camo, and ""tactical"" gear are the marks of dangerously paranoid and delusional people. I saw folks on the left being threatened by conservative morons simply because the morons had guns and were willing to kill their opponents and we on the Left are not. Those people cannot win at the ballot box (just like the Republican party as a whole), so they must cheat, bluster, and kill to get their way. I'm politically active, and I got tired of worrying about fascist dipshits threatening my life.

If I'm honest, I bought a gun more as a political statement than for practical reasons, but hey, I'm older and I've had a good life. I'd be happy to sacrifice myself to end the threat of white nationalists, nazis, the base, etc. I'd prefer to sacrifice *their* lives of course. My AK sits in the back of my closet. I'm already a good shot, and I have no desire to go to the range and be around gun people. If/when rightwing militias target liberal areas for death squad attacks, my AK will be there.
