I’d explain to be careful with taking out personal loans, work hard in college, save money, and never risk more than you can afford to lose or over leverage yourself. Or fuck it I’ll just tell them to buy a lot of AMD stock when it’s at $1 and save it for 10+ years until it hits $50"

RoastMe,fdooaej,t3_em6sfa,1578609233.0,Not really a roast but I’m a 25 year old white dude at your height so I can kinda sympathize. Most important advice I can give you is to hit the gym and lift weights so you’re not so scrawny.

unpopularopinion,fdig2tc,t3_elegip,1578442105.0,"So if you are on team never cops, does your distrust go as far as if a burglar was in your home or you were shot/mugged, you wouldn’t file a report?"
aww,fdhwkcc,t1_fdh9ejp,1578431453.0,I agree with you there. I guess I don’t see that often though. It’s mainly people just saying “hey that dog/kitten looks stressed” with no personal attack
aww,fdha74k,t1_fdh8jmo,1578418711.0,"That’s not exactly what I was getting at. People would rather see the world through rose colored glasses than believe something that makes them uncomfortable. Just above me some guy posted “They are the party poopers of Reddit”. Like if that’s your mindset how do you deal with criticism on a daily basis?

If some guy posted a vid of a dog doing something cute like zoomies but an animal behavior expert said he should get checked out for a seizure I’d be advocating to get it checked out rather than be upset someone spoiled my mood.

EDIT: Could someone reply why I’m wrong? I don’t mean to antagonize and genuinely want to know"

funny,fde601t,t1_fddyfz2,1578331934.0,Better sounds kind of passive aggressive and is subjective for everyone. You don’t strictly have to be a shut in or a frat bro either. I knew plenty of smart folks in college who subscribed to the work hard play hard philosophy.
