climbing,feuhb63,t1_fen3rr3,1579386571.0,"I ended up buying an $80 harness that can be used indoors and outdoors just so I have the option once the weather warms up, versus a $60 harness that was meant solely for indoors. If you think you’re going to get into outdoor climbing at all, I would recommend spending a little more so you don’t have to buy a second harness later on!"
