MonsterHunterWorld,fdh2j52,t1_fdgqo7i,1578413986.0,"I don't share your experience with guard or evade in 4U. Maybe for 140 Guild Quests? But the way you mentioned DPS in 4U is still the way I play MHW.
I found evasions to be easier in this game and the skill was very effective for the short time I tested it. Maybe I didn't fight the right monsters that exposed its flaws? Agreed about the increased aggression of some monsters. Personally,  I think the newer bluffs to ailments like wind and tremor make Heroics harder than before. 

I still don't see how the shift makes HB and DB pop up more unless a person is going comfy or they have extra space. And seeing Guard/GuardUp on GS is off to me. But everything is miles better than AutoGuard LS or Attack + 2 in the older games."

Sure, some non damage skills can increase DPS like Earplugs or Focus but HB and DB aren't one of those. It's not even about speed running and it's frustrating for people to make the options seem like we must choose between speed running and casual play.

And the difference between 5 mins or 20 is 15 minutes /jk. I would rather have it take as quick as possible with the weapon of my choice. It is a pain to know that you increased the monsters HP by doing multiplayer and the armor skills of the other players is lower than the added Health.
