medicalschool,fg6tjpn,t1_fg6qmvp,1580576540.0,"I'd say it depends on how intense you need to be for this block. E.g. for neuro block I needed to be 100% on neuro anki stuff because it was so much more intense. I think a reasonable time budget (including breaks, bathroom, etc) for Uworld is about 1-1.5 hours per 20q. That's 30 minutes to complete the questions (1.5min/per) and 30-60 to review the explanations (1.5-2ish min per). You can budget your time with that rule of thumb based on how much time you have, and then adjust it when you see your real pace. Make sure to schedule days to review incorrect answers. 

Also, if you consider 80q/day to be a *very conservative* quota for dedicated, you can finish uworld in 37 days. 120q/d = 25 days. I don't know how long your dedicated is, but with that in mind hopefully it gives you a good idea of how early you need to start"
