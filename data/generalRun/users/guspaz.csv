Monitors,ffgel0o,t1_ffgd52j,1579904493.0,"I'm kind of biased since I have the wide gamut version of that LG monitor (the 850). I'd focus more on the TN vs IPS comparison. People criticize the LG for having a slightly lower contrast ratio than other IPS monitors, but that Dell has an even lower contrast ratio than that. Plus the narrower viewing angles of a TN panel. On the other hand, the Dell wouldn't suffer from panel glow as much, since that's more obvious on IPS panels.

The LG has a lower average response time (though higher worst case) with less overshoot, but the Dell has BFI that can produce lower motion blur in total, at the expense of brightness and VRR/BFI only working together above 85Hz."
Monitors,ffgb283,t1_ffg5hvp,1579902315.0,"You mean, what is required for a FreeSync display to be qualified as G-Sync Compatible? I don't know the full detailed list of criteria, but nVidia has said that they must at least:

- Activate their VRR features automatically (enable VRR by default)
- Not show blanking, pulsing, flickering, ghosting or other artifacts during VRR gaming
- Operate in VRR at any game frame rate by supporting a VRR range of at least 2.4:1 (e.g. 60Hz-144Hz)

That third point is one that a lot of FreeSync monitors fail. A FreeSync monitor with a VRR window of 40-60Hz, for example, won't pass the certification to be considered G-Sync compatible. Having a VRR range above 2:1 is extremely important because it allows low framerate compensation, that is, performing VRR below the monitor's minimum refresh rate. A monitor that operates at 40-60, for example, has no way of displaying a VRR framerate of 35 FPS. It can't double up the frames, because that'd require 70Hz. But a monitor with a VRR range of 40-120 could display 35 FPS by drawing each frame twice at 70Hz."

Some people claim GPU scaling has more input lag, some people claim display scaling has more input lag, but nobody, as far as I can tell, has ever actually attempted to directly measure the latency. In the end, your GPU and your monitor won't use quite the same scaling algorithm, so try both and pick whichever looks better to you. Don't forget to compare the scaling mode options between your display and your GPU; aspect ratio scaling is probably what you want, and not all monitors have that built-in."

The enormous power required to do this completely negates any benefits that might have been gained via sparse rendering.

technology,feea7gj,t1_fee7uwp,1579029586.0,"My expectation with Starlink is that, compared to the general expectations, it will cost more, have lower speeds, higher latency, later availability, and more geographic restrictions.

In terms of cost, I don't think it will be outrageous, but I think that it will be competitive with fixed broadband providers at best, and still much cheaper than GEO services at best. It's not going to make Comcast drop their prices, but it's going to put GEO providers out of business.

In terms of speeds, I'm sure gigabit speeds will be technically possible, or perhaps even available, but that it would be the most expensive tier that only a few people would get. I think that typical speeds will be substantially lower, but even 100 megabit service with no transfer caps would be an enormous improvement for a very large number of people. You can throw $150/mth USD at a GEO provider today and all you get is 25 mbps, 50GB/mth, and latency that's often closer to a second than half.

In terms of latency, I think that once you include latency variation, buffering, and the actual trip to the destination (people seem to just focus on Starlink's latency just to get to the satellite and back), it will be higher than people expect, and slower than fixed broadband, but still a massive improvement over existing GEO services.

In terms of availability, I don't think it will be open for general signups (that is, without coverage limitations) in 2020. 2021 is likely, assuming there are no launch failures, since those freeze all launches for that vehicle until the investigation and mitigation is complete.

In terms of geographic restrictions, people expect that anybody will be able to sign up anywhere in the world. First of all, there will have to be some sort of restriction or customer cap in urban centres since the constellation will never (even at the maximum size) be able to support that sort of population density, or maybe just exclude them entirely. Second, they won't be able to offer service in any country until they've worked with the local regulators.

Apart from capacity concerns on the satellite-to-satellite links, it's cheaper and significantly faster (speed of light issues) for SpaceX to carry the traffic over the satellite network as close to the destination as possible so that they can get it directly to peering ISPs or exchanges rather than paying somebody else general transit fees to get it where it needs to go."

I think requiring airlines to dedicate 0.06% of their available throughput for flight recorders is pretty reasonable, and I don't think the cost of requiring airlines to have that or equivalent hardware installed on all flights would be particularly onerous considering we're talking about a network designed for consumer connectivity and they can use that same system to sell access to in-flight internet access to the passengers."
askscience,fdpppzb,t1_fdp8wji,1578635877.0,"And that's why the LEO constellations that are being constructed are going to make it feasible. SpaceX has put the first 180 of an initial 12,000 satellites in orbit, with the goal of providing global coverage up to gigabit consumer access. It's already been tested in flight, with the USAF using their initial two test satellites for a 610 megabit link to a C-12 in flight.

If you consider that the final constellation is intended to offer higher speeds than that for monthly costs that a consumer would pay, it's hard to see how it would be burdensome for airlines to send a full copy of all CVR/FDR data in real-time. If you've got a full gigabit per second of available bandwidth on the aircraft, is it really such a big deal to dedicate four 64 kilobit audio channels for the cockpit voice recorder, and however much the flight data recorder requires?

Airlines are going to want to install these things to offer global in-flight internet access to passengers, considering their costs will be substantially cheaper than existing competing solutions for in-flight network connectivity, and they'll still be able to charge passengers just as much since passengers won't have any choice. The connectivity for real-time FDR/CVR will already be there."
