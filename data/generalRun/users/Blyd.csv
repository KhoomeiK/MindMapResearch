The problem that you have in offering enhanced 'Homeless services' is that those that want to get off the streets already have a plethora of options, its the people that want to stay on the street is my worry and they will come in droves.

I'll use the example im directly familier with, Portland Or, aka 'Street Mecca', Portland brought in a new batch of laws like you are suggesting in 2014, in 2015 they declared a state emergency due to the vastly increased numbers of homeless people moving to Portland, the city has a term to identify people that choose to stay in the huge camps, they are called Criddlers.

You know I wasn't kidding about the poop either, what you are advocating for, out of good intent, is protection laws that result in this sort of thing, the city of Portland had to pay for biowaste teams to remove 3,300 Gallons of human fecal matter from the homeless 'door camps',.over 100 reports are made every day to remove fecal waste from business doorsteps, each costing the tax payer over $400 each time, people prefer to defecate in a shops door over moving 50yds to a public bathroom, which are all free.

I'm not even going to cover the fire risk that huge homeless camps bring with them or even the massive increase in crime or aggressive beggers.

You wont fix the 'Hobo' part of America its part of the fabric of the nation, people WANT to be hobo's, so i get you want to help, but focus that help on programs to get them off the street and not make the street a better alternative to paying rent.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelford_water_pollution_incident

If you were lucky enough to live close to the water plant you at least died really quickly from drinking almost pure sulphuric acid, if you lived further away you had the joy of experiencing what simultaneous Copper, Lead and Aluminium poisoning feels like, well for a short very painful time at least. 

To keep the privatization of water in the UK in positive light tens of thousands of locals and even more tourists from all around the world went unaware that they were drinking water with 3000x the permitted levels of sulphuric acid, 620 milligrams per liter of aluminum sulfate (Eu limit is 0.2) this resulted in the same effect that happened in flint, except the pipes really were victorian era lead and copper pipes.

Turns out that it was directly linked to cost-cutting by Southwest water, an important chemical input point was unmanned due to staff cutbacks leading to 20 tonnes of aluminum sulfate being dumped into the outflow rather than the inflow.

What did the government have to say about it at the time?

> ""I found there was a deliberate policy to not advise the public of the true nature until some 16 days after the occurrence of the incident."" The former Environment Minister(Meacher), claimed that ""various associated private bodies tried to bury the inquiry from the start, This has become a tug of war between the truth and an attempt to silence the truth.""

It also spawned 3 heavy regulatory boards,  water 'Privatisation' is privatization is the loosest terms, everything they do is mandated by the government and monitored, even prices are set by the government.

* The DWI (Drinking water inspectorate) for quality of water  
* NRA (National rivers authority)Now the EA (Environmental agency) and the welsh version (cant remember the name)
* Ofwat (Office of water management) who control the prices.
