funny,ffpn07z,t1_ffplzar,1580099146.0,"Agree = disagree.  Auto correct and poor spelling got me there.  And you seemed to be saying don’t bother because everyone does their own thing anyway.  

Even in agile someone has to decide they want something (inception), decide exactly what they want (analysis), decide how to accomplish it (design), implement it (develop, test), and deploy it (release).  You can call them different things.  You can shorten them.  You can increase their pace.  You can make them more or less formal.  You can design while you code.  You can test through automation.  You can use continuous integration to deploy as you develop.  But all of them still happen in some form.  

I don’t think there is anything in software engineering that can’t be better learned through reading, discussion with peers, and pair programming in an apprenticeship situation.  Doesn’t mean that college isn’t useful to fill in other educational gaps.  I was ahead of all my software engineering courses because of what I self learned and learned on co-ops.  I know quite a few great developers that got degrees outside of software engineering."

Been in the field since 93.  Anyone that thinks nothing is fundamental in this field hasn’t been in it long enough.  

Schools have to teach something and just explaining...er...it’s complicated isn’t exactly going to work.  But then again I think developers should go through apprenticeships rather than college so don’t entirely agree with your point there."

She did the same thing on her resignation letter and no one said anything about it.  Her husband got fired a few months later for viewing porn at the office for like the third time (lady who worked for him kept walking in while he was watching it and reporting him).  

Bout a year after she resigned she decided to come back.  Spoke to HR.  They brought her in for an interview.  HR lady walked into the conference room, laid down a piece of paper, and walked back out.  Lady looked at the paper to find it was a copy of her resume with the first column of letters circled in red pen.  Needless to say she got the message."

In other words I assume if I miss against a seven I lost that rack.  If I miss against a six I should lose that rack.  If I miss against a five I might lose that rack.  It is a good way of keeping yourself focused.

If she had other accounts with the bank then this is a complete long shot.  But would check with them just in case.  

Just search escheat and the state she lived in and you should be able to find some way to contact them.  Just don’t use a service as they will take a cut of what you can do for free."

And you seem to have lost the trail of my comments.  I was responding to someone saying they would rub off a coating if they cleaned the inside of the canopy.  Pointed out the coating would be much less effective on the inside of the canopy than the outside.  They aren’t putting a stealth x type liquid on a cloth, wiping it on the inside of the canopy and becoming super stealth.   Anything they add to absorb radar energy and dissipate it is likely to be on the outside of the canopy where it would be most effective or would be in the canopy material itself.  

Whether the canopy is nearly transparent or is transparent is very important when you are trying to get your radar cross section to the size of an eagle."

Based on my readings on all the stealth programs, the windows were often the biggest problem and were often as small as possible because of that.  Ie it was easier to manage the radar reflection from the metal surfaces than the glass because glass has to be seen through or it wouldn’t be there."

For me I just got into the habit of ordering a soft drink and an ice water.  I always had a drink in my hands so after a week or two that was the new normal.  

The other important thing is to never ever buy other people drinks.  That is an evil feedback loop that will get you feeling obligated to drink whatever your generous friends buy you which takes your control out of your hands.  Donâ€™t buy people drinks and donâ€™t accept drinks from others.

AskReddit,ff8i423,t3_es1gaf,1579679512.0,"Teacher in HS had a practice that she didnâ€™t see through and no one else had figured out how to exploit.  

The day before our finals, she would let us see the test for five minutes.  Could not take notes or anything, just see what was on it to help us know what to study.  Everyone in the class got Aâ€™s on both tests (midterm and final) and she couldnâ€™t figure out why.  

After she told us how she previewed the tests the day before I organized the class.  Had thirty people.  First person memorized the first two questions.  Second person memorized the second and third.  Third the third and fourth.  Down to the last who memorized the last and the first.  Werenâ€™t exactly same number of questions as people in class but close.  After the class we all met, compiled the test from everyoneâ€™s memory, using the overlap to double check what each question was.  We also had one guy in the class that had close to a photographic memory so was able to validate the whole thing and fix some spots where the two people on a given question couldnâ€™t agree.  We then as a group worked the problems as a group and everyone had a copy of the test and an answer key to memorize.  

Teacher also allowed students to play tapes in a Walkman if they showed her the tape was a purchased prerecorded tape.  I showed people how to tape over the holes that made recorders think it was a writable tape.  Then they could record over a crappy three dollar bargain bin tape with whatever they want.  Say the answers to thirty chemistry final questions hypothetically.  So even those who had bad memories and didnâ€™t understand the material were able to ace the test.  

Evidently took her two years before she realized what we had done and stop previewing her test.  And no one could listen to tapes during exams anymore."

billiards,ff43c1u,t3_erjdud,1579554632.0,"Whoever shoots first shot after the break has the push out option. How they got the shot doesnâ€™t really matter.  

The only scenario I can think of where this might come up is having a three ball frozen to the nine with the nine wired into a pocket.  Ball in hand on the one but no good way to get on the two.  No way to swing at the nine.  No way to play a lock up safe.  Then maybe in theory you might want to push out by making the nine so it gets spotted and out of harmâ€™s way.  

Having said that, it would never really happen.  Maybe if I want to show off to someone and can set up a trick shot with the push out that I know my opponent will give me back to do something fun.  Would never do that in a real important game but maybe in practice with a friend."
