Those are children being *killed.* It doesn't matter if 999 out of 1000 pit bulls you meet are nice if that *one* ends up killing a children, and pit bulls are known to have problems with being violent. That's the whole problem with ""anecdotal experiences."" I could ""anecdotally"" know five people who smoked their whole lives and end up living to 100 - it doesn't mean that smoking is not harmful.
