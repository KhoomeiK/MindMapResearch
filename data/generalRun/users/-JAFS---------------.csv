politics,fgg3ypt,t3_ey5v9u,1580753738.0,">""and how we create the political will is with you""

No, not exactly. The choir you're preaching to already has the political will to do these things. You need to convince people who think it's not a good idea why you think it's a good idea. And you don't do that by going ""look, you spend loads of money on stupid stuff. How about we cancel that to pay for my idea"". That's not a convincing argument. Basic politics 101."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fg8cneh,t3_exdyku,1580615620.0,They did it so they can stand in their back garden all day long chain smoking cigarettes and flicking the butts over into your garden. I'm willing to bet my life on it.
AnimalsBeingBros,fg751ra,t1_fg74soj,1580584172.0,I'm not sure how fences work. Maybe they're saying goodbye as he's released back in to the wild then

Black people are murderous maniacs and land thieves too. Oh wait that would be fucking racist if I said that."

wholesomememes,fg6bxoy,t1_fg6awut,1580563077.0,Imagine trying to yikes someone for saying nefarious. Reddit needs to ban under 18's. Maybe even under 21's. They are thick as shit
wholesomememes,fg6bntn,t1_fg691z5,1580562783.0,"I think they mean the last sentence ""that is exactly the energy I want to see from men in 2020"" implies men don't do this anyway and need to step up their game. If it had said ""..want to see from people in 2020"" it would've been less stereotypical. Op could have worded it less like they were a triggered bumhole tho"
AskReddit,fg6ayls,t1_fg5hz3w,1580561995.0,"Most Islamic countries suppress ""revolutionary politics"" and by suppress I mean chop their heads off but defining them as non-Fascist is splitting hairs. Economically and on principle they aren't Fascist, but by most modern definitions of totalitarianism they have fascist traits."

memes,ffvgxnx,t3_evfy61,1580263859.0,"There are lots of filthy and inconsiderate people in the world but I think this is more due to bins overflowing and not being emptied and then blowing shit across the street rather than people being filthy. Which is more an overpopulation and underfunded street cleaners problem. Maybe invent bigger bins with lids. Also, 1875 sounds like bullshit"
