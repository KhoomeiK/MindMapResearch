RWBY,fedbjke,t1_feagqo2,1579006696.0,I feel like her fighting style at the time was not good for fighting 1v1 anyway. After she learned to summon I think she was trying to practice? and made the wrong moves.
RWBY,fedbgg7,t1_fea1iv0,1579006618.0,"Because at the time, she needed time to summon. Her summons seem to come more naturally, but for example, the fight with Vernal, she'd stab her sword into the ground and a summoning glyph would appear, and it would take time to summon."

Weiss made a bad judgement call for the White Fang Lieutenant, while she doesn't make enough of those to call her a bad fighter, it's not a justification or mitigates her mistake.

Actually for Vernal, Weiss made the mistake of trying to summon, despite not having the time to summon due to being under attack. She made the ice wall to block Vernal, but it didn't work anyway."
