ems,ff9zif1,t1_ff9yy5d,1579724830.0,"So I'm a yoga teacher and personal trainer. We hold optional weekly general physical health classes with a discussion on any given health and/or wellness topic for half an hour, and then an hour yoga/fitness class. 

I want to allow family members to come— since our department is largely volunteer, most members can't make it and still fulfill family obligations. The most common feedback is that if family could join they would be there. So I'm looking for a waiver or guidance on the legal side of things as that tends to be the limiting factor. Something to bring to the higher-ups so they don't have to put any effort into it and just say yes lol."

Opioids are synthetic opiates. 

Opiates are drugs developed from opium. 

Opiates/opioids are both depressants and have no hallucinogenic or stimulatory effects. 

As for how they affect the nervous system, they bind to different receptors in the brain and basically dull the body's response to the core stimuli of the brain— breathing, eating, sex, etc."

todayilearned,feiujg8,t1_feiueql,1579147590.0,Yeah my edit explained it more in detail. Basically paralytics stop your breathing. Your heart has its own electrical system so paralytics don't touch it.
todayilearned,feiuaul,t1_feithmi,1579147404.0,"The venom is a paralytic. He's saying that as an emergency measure you just breathe for them until advanced life support arrives.
