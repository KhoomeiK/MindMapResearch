I think one of the reasons there hasn’t been a huge push for weed legislation is that the enforcement has been fairly progressive/lax. Only speaking for NSW here but for several decades they’ve generally taken the approach of it being a health/social issue rather than something that people get locked up for for having a bit in their pocket. I think if they threw the book at people over a bit of weed then you’d probably see more of a backlash in support of legalisation.

What needs to be said is not only does this only apply to the highest income earners, it only applies to a fraction of their income.

The highest tax bracket in my country of Australia is 47%. It sounds like a lot. This only actually applies to anything you earn above $180K ($120K USD). So if you earn $200K ($134K USD) you’re only paying around 30% in total. https://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Individual-income-tax-rates/

It’s a progressive tax and what ends up happening is that the top 10% of earners pay 50% of the nation’s income tax. The bottom 30% of earners pay 0 income tax. The bottom 50% of earners pay 0 net income tax (factoring in tax rebates for having kids, being a single parent etc)

While it is unfortunately thrown around a lot, it has always meant something more specific to me other than expressing any moral conviction.

Used as a pejorative it’s a matter of sincerity and authenticity. It’s great to believe deeply in something and to express it, but to ‘do it for the likes’ if there’s no real substance to me is what virtue signaling should mean regardless of what side of a topic someone sits on. 

An example would be when well-to-do people at formal events make a point of acknowledging the local aboriginal people at every chance they get. Generally, the accepted form of an acknowledgment at a lectern event is that it is given once by the MC or anyone opening the event. What often tends to happen particularly with politicians is that every subsequent speaker wants their turn to say it too to the point where it doesn’t really mean anything.

Expressing an acknowledgment in itself of course isn’t bad. I’d hope there wouldn’t be too many people who’d say aboriginal people shouldn’t be respected. It only becomes a problem when whoever is saying it is doing so for themselves and their own image rather than for the people they’re claiming to do it for. If they say they respect these people but don’t back it up with action or haven’t been bothered to learn anything about them aside from their name, that’s virtue signalling or at least what I hope the term comes to mean.

The problem is that it’s hard to know if someone is virtue signalling based only upon their statement. You’d need to know them personally or have some more contextual understanding to know if they’re being sincere. Without that, the term is useless and unfortunately I’d estimate the majority are using it without a deeper understanding of that person’s true motives. On the flip side, I’ve been involved with enough formal events to know that at least in this particular example the vast majority are saying it with the interests of themselves in mind rather than those of whom they claim to support."

Also your scenario misses the point. You’re only factoring in the light source rather than what is being lit. The stage is certainly lit but the audience isn’t, so from the point of view of anyone behind her within maybe 60 degrees laterally, her phone light is contrasted with a sea of black. That’s really annoying. 
Strobes are of course a different story as they would indeed distract from lower light source but they are used vary sparingly.

Of course it’s more annoying in a movie theatre as I said in my comment because there is less distraction from other lights and both light sources are constant, but this is likely to still be very annoying depending on the angle of the viewer. If it’s in that sweet spot of periphery forget about it...

Another factor to consider is that all other lights in the show are timed with the music. To have one near you that’s not timed to anything is jarring.
