You just need a screwdriver and a 2GB (maybe 4?) flash drive to reinstall the firmware. I had an external HDD so I transferred the games I wanted over there so I wouldn’t have to redownload them. 

I have PS+ so my game saves were backed up to the cloud, but if you have accounts that are not PS+ make sure you manually back them up on the flash drive. I accidentally deleted my GFs save data for Everybody’s golf and I’m not sure if she’s forgiven me yet. 

I don’t know exactly how much I paid but I bought this HDD in the link. Whatever you buy just make sure it’s a laptop 2.5 inch drive and NOT a 3.5 inch drive.

They convince people with no sales experience that they would be great saleswomen (typically they market it towards women) and have them buy all of this stuff that they then need to unload. 

Unfortunate most of these people don’t know sales and are stuck with a bunch of stuff they can’t sell so they lose money. It is also set up so the people above you on the totem pole make a lot more money than the grunts, so you keep slinging their product with the hope of climbing the ladder which leads you to try and convince your friends that they to should join the group so you are above them in line and the cycle continues.
