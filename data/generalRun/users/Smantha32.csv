aww,ffe8wzw,t1_ffah2ym,1579839930.0,They sure can be..cantankerous. lol
aww,ffabch2,t1_ffa7xrs,1579731566.0,"One of my cats is an angel until you try to clip her nails, then she goes nuts. We can even bathe her, no problem. I thought it was a great idea to have my moms help last week.. bundle her in a towel and then I'd clip her super quick. Yeah she started gnawing on mom's head. She's going to the vet this weekend for her trim."
AskReddit,ff6dovm,t3_ero8mj,1579624947.0,My 13 year old self couldn't talk to anyone so she'd probably be shocked to find that I'm fairly popular now. The suck is still real though in most other areas of my life.
AskReddit,ff6d84e,t3_erstu3,1579624654.0,"Intruders might be totally creeped out by a naked guy in their faces, so you might only have to deal with fire. lol"
fatpeoplestories,ff59hz2,t3_erh0fl,1579584291.0,Nice comeback. I'm glad you defended yourself.

AskReddit,ff0epe7,t1_fcy861a,1579468196.0,"I still use torrents.. I haven't come across any child porn yet, but for some reason people like to disguise regular porn as theater movies. It's not like people don't download that porn plenty under its real title. They're probably just trying to fuck anyone who wants to download the Avengers or whatever."

AskReddit,ff05r5v,t1_fcy37hr,1579465484.0,"As someone who's been on the receiving end of shit behavior, when someone I know apologized I appreciated that, and things are ok between us now. It depends on the level of shittiness they had to take from you, of course."
AskReddit,ff022sa,t1_fcy0r8z,1579464400.0,"I feel yah. My oldest friend was murdered by her husband and he made it look like a suicide. She'd been telling me for months he was threatening to kill her that way. I handed all those emails over to the police and the grand jury still decided to only charge him with assisting a suicide. He got 4 months, then ran to another country the second he was out. Police suck."
AskReddit,fezz65n,t1_fcxajt2,1579463419.0,I'm sorry that happened to you. Most Americans are nice.
AskReddit,fezvsmz,t1_feeeiod,1579462304.0,Basically the  whole current school system.

fatpeoplestories,feuhu4n,t1_fesfw8l,1579386655.0,"There seems to be a percentage of them who get off on making other people clean or take care of them. I remember reading a horrible story about a 1,000 pound obese woman in the hospital who would shit herself on purpose because she got off on having hospital staff clean her junk. Granted that is an extreme example though. For the majority of people yeah you would think shame would kick in and force some action."
AskReddit,feugzmv,t1_fetbj7m,1579386493.0,I was just hoping it would be sort of spooky? Mixed with festive lights. lol .. if they turn the whole town into a big witchy gift shop that is so much less interesting. lol
AskReddit,feugq5x,t1_feu6c99,1579386406.0,Good! I will leave it on my bucket list then. :)
AskReddit,feta817,t1_fenivgl,1579373242.0,When my mom went back in the 80's you could get actual money in the slot machines. She came back with a pocket full of silver dollars. Now it's all electronic chits or tokens. Let down.
AskReddit,fet9vf5,t1_feotiof,1579373114.0,the 18th century church in downtown Albuquerque is pretty cool. Of course then there's a shop selling X rated cakes a block away. Take it how you will. lol
AskReddit,fet8nuo,t1_fensxck,1579372803.0,"What sucks is that tourists fuck up historical landmarks. Eventually the only way to preserve something for future generations is to put a giant mile high fence around everything. I remember being in second grade, going through a pompeii exhibit on a school field trip and the rope off was only a foot away from the paintings, and some asshole kid flicked some paint off a 2,000 year old painting. When the hell is wrong with people? People can't NOT touch something or NOT destroy something."

AskReddit,fet55cx,t1_feoq9ya,1579371891.0,"We stopped in there when I was a teenager. I remember being creeped out by a lot of taxidermied animal heads on the walls. Other than that, it's a big ass glorified gift shop."
AskReddit,fet3or3,t1_feottnk,1579371518.0,"He bought a giant pyramid tomb there for future use. He's broke as a joke now so who knows, he might've had to sell. He had two houses there that I think he sold or are up for sale."
AskReddit,fet37zk,t1_fenfeia,1579371367.0,"I always had the impression it was a place you could get drugs in the 60's and 70's. I never heard anything about the actual city being ""all that""."
AskReddit,feprgck,t1_fen3e85,1579328776.0,Nobody knew the Mona Lisa even existed until some moron stole it in the early 1900's. It was a whole thing in the news back then. That put it on everyone's radar.

fatpeoplestories,femuvz5,t1_femjplu,1579270244.0,I think most people are up. Don't feel bad. I'm up by 10. I need to start my fitness efforts again too but I can't make myself go to the gym yet because I know it's packed with New Years resolution people. Maybe I'll go back to walking for a couple months until it clears out.
AskReddit,fehbap8,t3_ep1mtj,1579113019.0,"Does everybody die, or just me?
If everyone dies, I'd open the front door so my cats could go free and not starve.

If it's just me, I'd probably sit on the porch for awhile with a cold drink. There's not time to do much."

fatpeoplestories,fegoyl4,t1_fee5tk3,1579099080.0,I've heard that some really obese people can't position themselves over the toilet properly.. because literally too fat to know exactly where their butthole is.. and that's how some of these toilet messes occur. And they'd much rather blow up a public toilet than their own at home. I can't confirm though.
fatpeoplestories,fegoqpq,t1_fegbkj2,1579098925.0,My reason is that you hear way too many stories of an entire ship full of people catching the norovirus and then spend two weeks vomiting and shitting themselves and no one will let them leave... yeah... no.
AskReddit,fefyllw,t1_fea73ih,1579069625.0,They let kids in our school wear mohawks. Same time period.. 80-83. There was a guy who wore a multicolored one frequently. He joined ROTC in college if you can imagine that.

AskReddit,fe0uscr,t1_fdnfmz4,1578818914.0,The most awesome part of those message boards is that sometimes actors from those films would see people's questions and answer. Especially on older movies and shows.
