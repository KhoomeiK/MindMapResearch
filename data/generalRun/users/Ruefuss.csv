That's [your](https://freebeacon.com/politics/abc-news-has-covered-sanders-for-only-seven-minutes-in-2019/) privilege that [you](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/bernie-sanders-washington-post-media-complaint-872349/) dont have to pay attention to his media coverage."
politics,fegr2c4,t1_fegqtx5,1579100535.0,"Other people reading the comments might not though. They might even use those links to spread the word, even if the intended audience does not."
politics,fegqw67,t1_fegqf2r,1579100419.0,"If my candidate is bernie and every news network only runs negative stories about him or actively tries to ruin his run, why should I view them as different than fox? Same tactics. Different party it's used against. You just dont care because hes not you candidate."
politics,fegq7ug,t1_fegk2kl,1579099954.0,"That's only positive because it benefits your perspective. For a Bernie support that's seen CNN and other major news networks do nothing but trash or ignore their candidate, the Trump stuff doesnt matter. They're still just as biased as Fox for that reason, and many will likely not vote if hes not the candidate for that reason. He wasnt given a chance from the start. Just because they seem relatively fair to you, doesnt mean they do to all liberals."
politics,fegpuyq,t1_fegn9o8,1579099705.0,"""Trump is better than letting a democrat in office."" Despite claiming ""moral authority"" or ""small government"" or any number of other stances that Trump as a person is the antithesis of, they vote for him because at least he said he'll support their beliefs (but he didnt)."
politics,fegpkmn,t1_fego4u1,1579099509.0,You shouldnt assume that. Many people are politically isolated or simply dont pay attention to news. They might not have paid attention to any of it. Lord knows I have family that base their vote on the occasional glance at CNN in a break room.
politics,fegp9vs,t1_fegjb2b,1579099301.0,"You mean people quoting trump directly from camera and microphone? Because Bernie didnt say that, but Trump says something offensive in public view every other day. Dont see the comparison."
politics,fegp6ci,t1_fegh7ff,1579099233.0,They asked trump about statements he said on camera and on microphone. This stuff is rumors spread around by a political opponent being taken as truth.
insanepeoplefacebook,fedb9uk,t1_fec18ea,1579006446.0,"The US has a marginal tax system. Even if we went back to the old marginal rates, 70% was the top rate. If we followed AOCs plan, that we be on tax earned on every dollar **AFTER** 10 million earned that year. Bernie's current plan has a top marginal rate of 52% on every dollar earned after $10 million.

Learn how marginal rates work or stop being disingenuous.

And even if average taxes increase for the ""middle class"", they wouldnt have to pay for health insurance or health insurance premiums. Personally, I'll pay higher taxes to stop paying for those."
insanepeoplefacebook,febot3i,t1_febaqdw,1578961087.0,"Yes. The more money you earn in this country, the more you benefit from its services, protection, and people. Why wouldnt it be selfish to avoid paying a fair share for what this country helped you earn?

 If I'm a blue collar worker, my wages havent risen above inflation for decades despite increase in production, and my benefits are being taken away from me. If I'm a large business owner or investor making decent money off the stock market, my income has risen significantly while my taxes have, for the most part, reduced. They only make money thanks to american laws, american workers, american innovations, and american infrastruction/defense. They deserve to benefit from their successful investments, but so do the american people who helped them earn it. And we havent."
