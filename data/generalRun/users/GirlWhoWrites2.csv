fatlogic,ffbzgvy,t1_ffbc3el,1579787582.0,"I guess it's a bummer to me that they're willing to avoid so many different types of exercise on the off chance they'll hate it. Not a lot of what I do at the gym can be considered ""joyful movement."" Some of my workouts are fueled by hate and spite. But...they help. I feel better mentally and physically afterwards. Hell, there's a machine that I use that I 100% despise. But, I use it because I want to get better at that particular exercise. I never want to go back to living the unchallenged life. It's sad that some people see a possible difficulty and immediately decide it's not worth it."
fatlogic,feniksk,t1_fel1xbo,1579285464.0,"I read this and my brain automatically said ""Hi, Dr. Nick!"""
fatlogic,felq9pd,t1_fekh9fq,1579228314.0,I can't eat anything with pistachios. Ate pistachio cheesecake on the same night I discovered I had a stomach bug. Spent the next day vomiting and will never look at pistachios the same.
AskReddit,feh2zih,t1_fegxgqp,1579108073.0,"I was at a Third Eye Blind show and the lead singer said ""You all came here for the same reason. You came here to feel something together."" And it was a very legit sentiment."
AskReddit,feh2wk9,t1_fegjhhy,1579108024.0,"I went to a Goo Goo Dolls convert. There's a line in one of their songs that says ""everyone is forgiven now."" To hear thousands of people singing that line...I swear it was soul cleansing."
fatlogic,fe06awj,t1_fdz3zpz,1578804146.0,I mean...she was with her nieces. Family changing rooms are great for parents with young children. I'm sure that's what it was about and had nothing to do with weight.
fatlogic,fdtyb5m,t1_fdol0zh,1578724226.0,It costs me $12 to meal prep my lunches for work for two weeks. I used to spend that on one fast food meal.
memes,fdhgrae,t1_fdh5ox8,1578422306.0,She didn't accept donations. She just sent nudes if people sent proof they donated $10 to the actual charities.
AskReddit,fcy7s18,t1_fcxg7sm,1578075952.0,"I've started just plainly saying ""You interrupted me. I'm going to finish my sentence now."" It's amazing how many people are interrupters out of habit and have never been called on it."
comics,fcv7153,t1_fcn79to,1577995968.0,Just caught up on all your comics. They're adorable. Can't wait to see more.
AskReddit,fcmyyud,t1_fcmyov5,1577798169.0,Sounds like the guys my brother ran with. I keep telling friends/family it's just not healthy to raise kids down there. There's no resources for them to do anything other than stupid shit. Plus add on that consequences never really stick there either and it's a mess. My brother got arrested a bunch of times. Probation and community services. He's still down there living in a camper and doing all the drugs. That area is a blackhole.
AskReddit,fcmylyk,t1_fcmhfon,1577797790.0,"That's wild. I was down there around that time too. Got the hell out of that area as well. Don't really remember much organized drug/violence. Lots of tweakers, though."
AskReddit,fclw8z3,t1_fcikwln,1577757995.0,That does not seem like something I'd expect to happen there. How long ago was this?
memes,fc5d8nn,t1_fc53wpy,1577454020.0,It's too early in the morning for riddles.
MadeOfStyrofoam,fc4kmqi,t3_eff7xu,1577419441.0,"A friend told me that he was raised in such a way that he now has a crippling fear of taking up any emotional real estate. If you're like us you were treated as a burden and now whenever you need help you may feel like you're stealing resources from others. 

I'm told therapy can help overcome it. Fucking double edged sword, though, because you've got to take up some space to ask for therapy help. 

Good luck, friendo."
entitledparents,fc41oee,t1_fc3wqig,1577404290.0,It's missing a lot of emotionally charged language one would expect from this situation.
