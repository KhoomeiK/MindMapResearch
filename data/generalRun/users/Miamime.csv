As a placekicker, if you don't handle punting duties, you are on the field for maybe 10 plays a game so your results are magnified. If you miss long field goals in tough conditions it is one thing, but Baxa missed a 27 yarder against GT in a game that we would lose in OT, a 26 yarder against UNC in a game we would lose by 3, and a 27 yarder against UF in a game we would lose by 4 but had the ball on their 26 with 12 seconds to play. That is simply unacceptable. You have to be able to rely on your kicker when the game is on the line. We had absolutely no faith in the kicking game to the point we had to use walk-ons and ultimately were forced to go for it on every 4th and short in field goal range.

nfl,fen6pwc,t1_femzbgg,1579278181.0,"It was not a quality of back comparison it was a shelf life comparison. Jacobs broke 1,000 yards in consecutive seasons on a 5.0 YPC average in both and was Tiki Barber’s heir apparent. Then he had a down season, was relegated to being a backup (though did have one good year in that role), and was basically out of football after the following season. He rushed the ball just 215 times across 3 seasons after turning 28 and was still technically in his “prime”. He was done playing at 31, and done playing well at 28. 

Jacobs was a tough runner, a solid pass catcher, and had some skill, even if it wasn’t at Henry’s level. I have no dog in this fight; I couldn’t care less if Henry does well or goes bust, you guys aren’t even in our conference. But big backs tend to have a precipitous decline, and backs in general historically have had poor seasons after one where they’ve rushed 300 times. Henry already has 800 carries in his 4 year career, and Saban absolutely rode him his final year at Alabama (**395** carries as a junior plus another 172 as a sophomore). With Tannehill as your QB, I would expect you continue to ride Henry since Tannehill isn’t really a playmaker, and Henry will likely continue to produce as long as your OL stays solid and healthy. But given that Henry will be coming up on 27 next season, I just don’t see him continuing at this level for more than a season or two and declining quickly thereafter.

It’s an interesting dynamic but nearly every PM has expressed gratitude and appreciation to having an independent, non-reactionary individual with whom they can speak and discuss political matters. 

Also, while I agree that the Queen’s court could be reduced in size, it actually used to be much larger. The number of individuals on the register (or whatever the official word is) has been significantly reduced over the years. Furthermore, they have cut down on the number and extravagance of events and spending. Plus, a lot of their funds now come from their own private sources; they rent out some of their homes and properties, the Crown Jewels (property of the Queen) are on display which you can pay to see, etc. 

Lastly, UK Parliamentarians make £79,468 in “basic annual salary” this year. This comes to $103.5K USD. In Canada, the figure is $178,900 CAD, or $137.0K USD. So, in relative currency, the salary is higher but is certainly not “double”. I know MPs in Britain get a lot of perks, like a house to use (which with London’s rent is a big deal), so all told, with ancillary benefits, their salaries and wages could be quite comparable. It doesn’t help that the British pound has been in the shitter ever since the Brexit referendum. In June 2015, the pound to USD conversion was 1.6. By October of the following year it fell all the way to 1.2. From June 2016 to July 2016 it fell 10% alone. The Canadian dollar, however, has largely remained steady within a nice 0.7 to 0.8 range."
todayilearned,fedn50j,t1_fedfxmf,1579015570.0,"Read the comment below. If this doesn’t qualify as work, I don’t know what to tell you. It’s largely consistent with the day of any other politician:

>Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is Head of State of 16 governments, and leader of the Commonwealth of 53 nations.
Her rôle in Britain is like the President in countries without a sovereign. She delegates the government of the country to her parliament, but is Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the Crown. She is also Supreme Governor of the Church of England that signifies titular leadership over the Church of England, though is considered to be a Presbyterian like her mother.
A typical day starts each morning at nine, as a piper plays on the terrace beneath her apartment at Buckingham Palace to start the working day. The Queen scans the British newspapers before reading her correspondence. She usually receives 200-300 letters from the public each day. She chooses a selection of letters to read herself and tells her staff how to respond to them.
Her Majesty then meets with two of her private secretaries and examines her official papers. Policy papers, Cabinet documents and State papers are sent to her in 'red boxes' and, where necessary, she signs and approves them. She does this every day, apart from Christmas Day.
A series of official meetings follow with the likes of overseas ambassadors, High Commissioners, newly appointed British ambassadors, and senior members of the British and Commonwealth Armed Forces. The Queen and each visitor meet alone, usually for about 20 minutes.
If there is an investiture, the ceremony begins at 11am and lasts just over an hour. If the Queen is on engagements, she usually has three per morning, either alone or until he retired, with the Duke of Edinburgh, now other members of her family. Recently she has been accompanied by the newest member, the Duchess of Sussex.
The Queen either has a private lunch or she and the Duke will invite a dozen or so guests for an informal lunch.
Afternoons are usually spent on public engagements. These are carefully selected from hundreds of invitations sent to her each year, often by Lord Lieutenants, the Queen's representatives in the county.
She carries out over 300 engagements per year. The Queen visits schools, hospitals, factories, military units, art galleries, hostels for the homeless and British and Commonwealth organisations.
On occasions, the Queen, often, until he retired, with the Duke of Edinburgh, goes to a city or region for the whole day. She often ends the afternoon meeting government ministers from the Privy Council.
The Queen has a weekly audience alone with the Prime Minister when they are both in London. This usually take place at Buckingham Palace at 6.30pm on a Wednesday.
No written record is made of these meetings and tradition dictates that communications between the Queen and Prime Minister remain confidential.
At about 7.30pm on weekday evenings, a report on the day's Parliamentary proceedings, written by one of the government whips, arrives. The Queen insists on reading these the same evening. The Queen sometimes attends film premiers, charity concerts or a reception for a charity of which she is patron.
Her Majesty also hosts official receptions at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and the Palace of Holyrood house. Other receptions or dinners may be linked to a State visit. She entertains 50,000 visitors on behalf of the State each year.
For this, she pays the British Treasury £300 million a year income as long as the government runs the country on her behalf.
Of 193 UN states, 134 have a separate Head of State and Head of Government. 37 have a hereditary royal Head of State like Britain."

This is far more oversight than what a speed monitoring system would do in Uber's case. If Uber implemented a check like that, it would assuredly be automated and would probably log as a demerit every time a driver went X miles per hour over the speed limit. 20 demerits results in a removal (again, automatic) from the Uber system.

I would hardly consider that to be an active monitoring control. An active monitoring control would be having a Uber-representative sit in each Uber car once per month or year, requiring Uber drivers to retake a driving exam once every X years, etc. *That* would be far more indicative of an employee-employer relationship than it is now and much more akin to what you described in the quoted comment."

> Approximately two months into the 2017 season, a group of players, including Carlos Beltrán, discussed that the team could improve on decoding opposing teams’ signs and communicating the signs to the batter. **Cora arranged for a video room technician to install a monitor displaying the center field camera feed immediately outside of the Astros’ dugout.**

>Witnesses consistently describe this new scheme as player-driven, and **with the exception of Cora**, non-player staff, including individuals in the video replay review room, had no involvement in the banging scheme.

The Red Sox may as well fire him now."
baseball,feajpyo,t3_eo8gi3,1578949644.0,"There seems to be a general consensus that this ""was not enough"" but I disagree in part once the shock wore off. Since there's so many people saying this, I can't even respond to one person as to my thoughts so I'll just say this:

$5M is the maximum allowable fine per the league's Constitution. They literally could not fine them more than this. If they had, the Astros could sue and would win.

A one year suspension on its face for Luhnow and Hinch seems short but I have a strong suspicion that the league knew both would be fired. Thus, this becomes a pretty strict punishment. Neither of those two will get a shot at a GM or manager position, respectively, for a very long time. Hell, they may be out of professional baseball entirely for a few years. Not only are their reputations and accomplishments irrevocably tarnished but they will lose millions in career earnings. That's a big fine. This is similar to a ""show clause"" penalty in college.

Taubman's one-year ban may as well be a permanent ban. Between this and the comments he made in front of those reporters, he has such a stench on him that there's no way he gets a key job for years if at all.

I agree you could not really punish the players. The commissioner worded it well in his statement:

>I will not assess discipline against individual Astros players. I made the decision in September 2017 that I would hold a Club’s General Manager and Field Manager accountable for misconduct of this kind, and I will not depart from that decision. Assessing discipline of players for this type of conduct is both difficult and impractical. It is difficult because virtually all of the Astros’ players had some involvement or knowledge of the scheme, and I am not in a position based on the investigative record to determine with any degree of certainty every player who should be held accountable, or their relative degree of culpability. It is impractical given the large number of players involved, and the fact that many of those players now play for other Clubs.

I think it's unprecedented that a team has no first or second round picks for two consecutive drafts. All things held equal, I think a lot of free agents stay away from the Astros for a couple seasons. The roster will age. Maybe not this season or next, but it seems like there will be a lull in talent and success in the not-so-distant future and it can at least be partially attributed to this punishment."
baseball,feahk5q,t1_fe9zzku,1578948864.0,"He absotluely will. Look at the comments from the Commissioner's statement:

On Hinch: ""**Hinch neither devised the banging scheme nor participated in it.** Hinch told my investigators that he did not support his players decoding signs using the monitor installed near the dugout and banging the trash can, and he believed that the conduct was both wrong and distracting. Hinch attempted to signal his disapproval of the scheme by physically damaging the monitor on two occasions, necessitating its replacement. However, Hinch admits he did not stop it and he did not notify players or Cora that he disapproved of it, even after the Red Sox were disciplined in September 2017.""

On Cora: ""**Cora was involved in developing both the banging scheme and utilizing the replay review room to decode and transmit signs. Cora participated in both schemes, and through his active participation, implicitly condoned the players’ conduct.** I will withhold determining the appropriate level of discipline for Cora until after the DOI completes its investigation of the allegations that the Red Sox engaged in impermissible electronic sign stealing in 2018 while Cora was the manager. ""

Both Luhnow and Hinch seem to get exonerated by the report while the blame is levied on Cora. However, since those two were the captains of the ship, they were the ones punished. This is why you saw no player punishment:
