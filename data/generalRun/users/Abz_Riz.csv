AskReddit,ff7714s,t1_ff6mfgm,1579642381.0,"Life is suffering. To be honest, it’s a little optimistic. If you’re not suffering you should be ecstatic, since suffering is the natural state of existing. Suffering is the price we pay for being.

You will suffer tremendously in life, just like everyone that has ever existed, is existing and will exist. All we can do is minimise the suffering and expel any unnecessary suffering. We can not control most of it, we can only decide how to respond to it, that is the ultimate freedom. The suffering life produces often leads to moral pitfalls, which leads to cruelty. Do not make that mistake. Respond to it appropriately, with a clear mind."

Darth Plagueis was a dark lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise, he could use the force to influence the midichlorians to create... life.
