bipolar,fddcm99,t1_fddbuw4,1578305802.0,"Cool! Is there a program like illustrator/photoshop you use or is there software that just comes with the iPad?

Yeah I can see that. I haven't really drawn on paper since I was 13. But I have done some stuff in illustrator with my computer mouse recently and its quite an enjoyable process. Definitely has a fast flow."
bipolar,fddbrha,t3_ekrb7j,1578304495.0,"Glad you're feeling better. Hope you get back into your routine :)

Love your artwork! So cool. Those eyes are epic.  
Did you draw it on a tablet/ipad?"
MentalGold,es5nmjz,t3_bt21va,1561619181.0,My man! I was wondering about the pregnancy and how things were going. I am so glad to hear that everything worked out. That is so exciting. You are going to be a fantastic Dad :)
