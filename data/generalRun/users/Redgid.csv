It explains why, I am calmly & methodically looking for an valuable item I have lost, somewhere, instead of freaking out, grabbing my knees & rocking ""to & fro"". Almost, completely true, I am unable to grab my knees, but I can sit in my recliner or the edge of my ""wheeled office chair"" & rock. \[& cry\] Besides, I am 73 y.o. Bottoms up! \[really!\]"
YouShouldKnow,fe73o6r,t1_fe49zmq,1578909592.0,"I was given a very strong ""broad spectrum antibiotic"" , before a dental procedure. I started feeling terrible almost immediately, gastric distress, etc.. I felt so bad I had to stop the antibiotic & I put off the dental procedure.

Felt sick for about 8 mos. after the antibiotic   with digestive distress & body aches. I reread an article about probiotics. I decided to try the activated yogurt (probiotic) if it helped I would try the multiple bacteria tabs or capsules.

I started feeling better within days. I started taking the multiple good bacteria tablets. My stomach distress (diarrhea) started to go away, hemorrhoids started to calm down. Stopped having to use tons of toilet paper & baby wipes, to get clean. Body pain & fatigue eased up.

Felt good, so I stopped taking the probiotics and all the problems started returning. Started taking the probiotics again & started feeling a world of difference to the point that I am feeling better than I did before taking the antibiotics. Still take probiotics every day."

Where has it been shown?"
YouShouldKnow,fe6ct59,t1_fe41ouu,1578887184.0,"My sentiments exactly ! ! 

Plus, you don't have to use so much toilet paper. The probiotics do their job & food is more thoroughly digested, less waste.

Toilet paper is so expensive, now it is almost cheaper to use $1 bills."

Emailed tech support after several months of the same problem. Was po'd after previous emailed complaints had not fixed the problem.

Now, important, time sensitive Rxs disappear from website or have been cancelled  ( had the Dr.'s office check & it was not  Dr.'s office), EVERY Rx gets flagged for some bogus insurance problem ( had the same Insurance for 18 yrs. w/no problems), purchase history disappear, cannot get Rx status reports!

What can I do now?"

fossilid,fe21jp3,t1_fdredzq,1578833457.0,"I am used to finding different fossils from different eras because I hike a creek basin. One side of the creek bank is 25ft. to 40 ft. higher than the other side. There are many layers of different colors & types of deposits. There is a distinct layer of several feet of Cretaceous Chert on this side. The other side of the creek bed is lower and when floods come, all kinds of fossils from different eras become mixed from the different elevations & deposits.

To add to this mix are the gravel pits, highway  construction, water, sewer & gas line excavations of different depths. So everything is not naturally distinct.

I have gone into the gravel pits & excavation sites, but mostly on the floodplain is where I collect, on my property. Everything is mixed & spread out on top of the floodplain, no digging, maybe a little prying.

I have found  dinosaur mummies specimens  made of chert. Dinosaur fossils are not all bones. I have found whole animals of mostly chicken size. I also find heads with facial features on both sides in anatomically correct locations. I find these in every size up to big dog size.

I do find fossil bones from almost every part of an animal. I took ""Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy"", in college, so I am familiar with what I ,or others, may find. I was asking for observations

I was asking the collector if these features were there. If they were not there, they are something else. I was telling  the collector to rule these features out. Study what you have & don't jump to conclusions.

It is very hard to identify anything based on a 2 dimensional observation. Things on the surface of the object could rule out ,that it is a femur. You have to look @ all sides of a specimen. I was asking to check for these features, not that it was a final observation or determination. The final determination should be in person, if possible.

You have to be able to change templates of what you are looking for, everytime you pick a specimen up, or else you may lose the ""find"" of your lifetime.

I have found insects, completely composed of clear & milky crystal, in a fissure of an otherwise unremarkable stone. I just happened to have a pocket microscope with a light. I had to change the mental template of what I was looking for. If not this, perhaps ""this""!"
fossilid,fdqdl3c,t1_fdqb3wz,1578663851.0,"I found one shaped like that, but black, larger & had a ""leather like"" outer texture or impression. I was told it was a Hadrosaur egg.

I'm not saying  this is an Hadrosaur egg, though. It could be another reptile egg. See if someone with a keener eye &  more specialized can give a better ID."
fossilid,fdqchym,t3_elzx4c,1578662954.0,"Looks ""fishy"" to me. The vertebra shape & the fine hair-like bones. IMHO"
fossilid,fdqc3pm,t3_emhw8b,1578662618.0,"It looks to me like a small or baby ""dinosaur mummy head"". The rough clumped end is where it was attached to the body  and broke off or was chewed off.

Does it have a ""sunflower like"" impression on one or both sides? If it does, this indicates an eye. Especially if there is a matching one on the other side.

Have you looked at it under magnification? Check the partially bisecting line or groove under a magnifying glass or pocket microscope (60x to 100x). See any fine tooth or serrations as a lizard would have in its mouth?

Does the bisecting groove appear on the other side?

Are there any skin or scale impressions or patterns. If so, do they change from the main body pattern to a different shape around where an eye or mouth would be? Just like a, present day, reptile."

fossilid,fdaql48,t3_ek1don,1578248991.0,"It is hard to be 100% with just one image or side.

It does seem to indicate 3-compartmentalized individuals. If you rotate the image, I think you have a clutch of 3-reptile eggs.

I see fiber patterns in the upper right section. This could be feathers, fur or nesting material or just something incidental. You need to look at this area, under magnification.

In the upper center, I see an  (possible) adult creatures head, eye, nose & mouth  @ a 45 dgr. angle.. Possible external feature on the top left of (possible) head. I see possible long vertebra structures.

This with a ""mental template"" view of a 2-D image. Need more images & sides. IMHO

Very nice, interesting ""find""!"
