AmItheAsshole,ffcovbd,t3_esszjw,1579804054.0,NTA but there might be something else going on here that made her react like that.  Maybe she doesn’t think you include her in your life enough or something.
aww,ffbx4rc,t3_essyrj,1579785630.0,Love it!
stopdrinking,ffbn43c,t3_esqswk,1579773657.0,"Try to drink a little less than the last time every time.  Or try AA?  At some point you will need to make the decision to push through the really tough urges no matter what if you are going to stay sober.  When you get one you should not be alone, call a supportive friend who will keep you on track.  Go stay at someone’s house if you need to in order to be distracted.  Maybe visit friends with kids.  That cheers me up and distracts me.  

It’s hard but you keep trying and I believe if you do eventually you will stop.  I kept trying on my own and failing so I went to AA and I haven’t drank since I started counting days.  I have a love hate relationship with AA but I still haven’t drank so can’t fault it."
Sober,ffbmqtd,t3_esqt4g,1579773089.0,"Oh I just had this overwhelming wish for your success and empathy for your situation right now.  If this is your last time quitting, it will never be this hard again.  Well done for pushing through!  My only advice is plan and do something fun.  I needed to make sober life exciting enough to want to stay sober."

benzodiazepines,ffblvnz,t1_ffbak8g,1579771757.0,"5 mgs on a relatively empty stomach should be enough to feel it your first time and until you build up some resistance.  I felt it with 2mgs in the beginning.  Your body gets used to it quickly so taking it infrequently will have a better effect.  I would not keep taking them until you feel a high.  It’s not like that for me and because of the resistance and the difficulty getting the pills I would make the most out of each one.  Also it slows down your whole body so you can stop breathing.

Also for me Xanax is more of a head relaxation and Valium is more in the body if you know what I mean."
benzodiazepines,ffaxixs,t3_esmlhz,1579746794.0,"So you took 5 pills (5 or 10mgs) in 4 hours, plus a bottle of wine and 1.5 four lokos?

I don’t know about the other meds, but I think most people would feel that a lot if it was their first time taking it.  But it depends on your size I think and what you ate.  They also come in 2mgs so maybe they were 2s.  Or maybe you were drunk enough to not notice?  

And yes it does sound very dangerous but you know that.  Generally they make me feel very relaxed but not euphoric or high.  It’s more deeply relaxed in my body, like my body is very heavy and someone has massaged my shoulders."
AmItheAsshole,ffauykd,t1_ffarwt5,1579745092.0,"I agree with that.  Assuming they are in the US.   HR is just there for the company not the employees.  And the woman would probably have to be told that she is making the man feel uncomfortable before any further action.

Otherwise, Chelsea market is just some shops and you would be done in 10 minutes.  Maybe check out some comedy at UCB or other comedy venues?  Or shopping in Bloomingdales and Hudson Yards?

Also you could do a bus tour to get a lay of the land, if it’s your first time in NYC."
stopdrinking,ffaeqr1,t3_esjqto,1579733957.0,IWNDWYT too!  I have found that I have not gotten those intense urges in the past few months.  So I assume it gets easier and easier until you rarely consider packing it all in.
stopdrinking,ff8nppt,t3_es99cy,1579687761.0,I think it takes a while for things to stabilize.  But you might also be depressed.  Your doctor can be a good resource if you continue to feel that way long term.

For me, a moment of enlightenment was when I was really stressed about a work issue and I thought I deserved a drink and I realized the last thing I needed right then was a drink.

AmItheAsshole,feyamdp,t3_eqwbfu,1579443049.0,NTA.  How long have you been with this guy?  Does he do other things that are are similar.  I would be concerned about his social skills.  It’s super weird that he reacted this way for a number of reasons and I could be concerned about the life you might have if you stay with him.

stopdrinking,fewj5r1,t3_eqrh2z,1579411633.0,Yeah it’s a bit of a phenomenon.  I would tell people I drink too much and they would always assume the best.  It’s probably the one time in life where the whole world assumes the best.

AmItheAsshole,fenhcww,t3_eq3zdq,1579284711.0,"NTA but you need to talk it out.  You need to work out when he will pay rent and bills, if he is saying he can live for free because of the renovation costs.  It’s a bit messy to start like this rather than an agreed rent and bills split.  Can you afford to give him back what he gave you and charge rent and expenses in a more upfront way.  He should be paying his way and you are in no way an asshole for expecting it."
AmItheAsshole,femwzo3,t3_eq12gk,1579271800.0,NAH but I would be kinder about it and leave the door open to connect at some point in the future.  Chance are you will change your mind when you are older.  You also could just meet him for coffee but tell him you are apprehensive about it because it upsets you to be reminded of that part of your life and you want to move on from it.  If he knows that he won’t take it as personally.  Do you live in the same city?
stopdrinking,femwhwf,t3_eq0x4s,1579271435.0,"I was like that in many ways.  I guess I still am only I don’t drink.  And life is A LOT better.  You are probably addicted to alcohol physically and that’s what is causing the uncontrollable urge.  Have you read The Naked Mind, or Alcohol Explained?  Or have you tried an AA meeting?  All of those helped me."
stopdrinking,femhgjx,t3_epybtg,1579255747.0,"That’s why the concept of one day at a time works so well.   If each individual day is better without alcohol, don’t think past that.  It sends me into panics too.  For me, I really just wanted to do 90 days to give myself a good break and see how I felt after.   Then I felt great at 90 days and wanted to continue.  But still I won’t say I have quit forever and I only tell close friends I quit.  

You might also be feeling withdrawals which make you feel very stressed and anxious.  I don’t know how long since your last drink, but that could be a factor.

Just take it in small bites for a few days and see how you feel.  IWNDWYT"

But it’s weird.  Could you accept the offer, have nobody else help and keep him super busy all day?  It’s weird though but you might be better off just accepting their offer than turning them down and making other plans.

It’s kind of like if you are overweight, people will tell you you are not fat when the scales clearly says you are.  They just don’t want to hurt your feelings and they love you as you are.  Or, they also have a drinking problem and they don’t want to lose their drinking buddy and face themselves.  People usually immediately compare their drinking to mine when I tell them I quit.
