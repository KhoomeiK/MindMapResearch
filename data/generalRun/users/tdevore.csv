There is never a time when you know exactly what is going on with that person. So when you, in your ignorance, say that someone should ""learn the language "" you in fact have no idea what you're talking about. That person may in fact be doing just that."
PublicFreakout,ffo7tjc,t1_ffh0zw4,1580074946.0,"Yeah but ""learn the language"" is a loaded phrase. It is incredibly difficult for most people to learn a new language as an adult. How do you know at what phase of learning a person is? Maybe they are attending ESL classes and are at the beginning stage. Maybe they know the language somewhat but aren't quite fluent yet. Or maybe they are fluent but are with someone who speaks their native language and just feel more comfortable speaking it. No one knows. And the truth is it's none of anyone's business anyway. People really need to stop that learn the language nonsense."
