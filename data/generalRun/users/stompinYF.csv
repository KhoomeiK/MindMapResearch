850gb is larger then I thought. I was thinking a usb pen drive could hold it. You could maybe put them all on a cloud service like dropbox/ google drive/ one drive etc. But that require a monthly charge. On the plus side that would be your backup and you can share with people that are not on your wifi. 

If they are currently on a computer at home that is always on, you could file share from it, but the instructions on how to do that will depend on what operating system each user has etc.

Here is a windows 10 guide.

Here is how you could share using a linksys router and usb.

But most brands can do that now. Just look up any router you are thinking of buying before and see if they support file sharing."

What is the total file size, and what is the make and model of your router?"
NoStupidQuestions,fgf1sr8,t3_ey3q2u,1580719778.0,"There are a few main parts. 2 heat exchangers or radiators (rad). A compressor, a valve, and the fluid (freon).

Take a brand new never turned on fridge and plug it in. Everything is at room temperature, the fridge and the freon.

The compressor turns on, it compresses the freon as it exits the fridge or the side you want cold.

When you compress a gas, its temp rises. If you took all the air in a room and squished it into bottle all the heat in the rooms air is concentrated into a smaller area. So while the amount of heat is the same, the bottled air is hotter becus its volume is less.

So this hotter then room temp gas, after being compressed goes through a radiator outside of the fridge or the side you want cooled. And looses some of the heat it had to the air in the room.

As it leaves the radiator and enters into the fridge, it passes through a valve. This valve is similar to a valve on a cigarette lighter. On one side its a liquid (compressed) on the other side its a gas. This is the reverse of the room air into a bottle example. The gas is now cooler then room temp because the gas when compressed lost some heat, but is no longer compressed.

This is why aerosol spray feels cold. It is cold from going from a liquid (in the can) to a gas of much larger volume. Hair spray, deodorant, butane etc. It is colder when it exits the can, and this is the same type of valve.

This cold lower pressure gas goes through the radiator on the inside of the fridge where the heat in the room temperature air inside moves into the lower temp gas. The gas exits the inside radiator into the compressor and the whole process repeats.

Its just a big loop, the compressor moves the freon and compresses it, the valve drops the pressure, and the two rads allow heat to to move from the higher heat concentration to lower heat concentration.

Air conditioning works the same way.

How did they figure that out? My guess is they noticed that compressing something made it warmer, so they tried the reverse.

For extra reading, look up swap coolers, then have your mind blown when you look up peltier elements."
