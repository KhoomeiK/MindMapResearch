Originallylly thought this was a surf board. A skate board would be much easier to coat. Pretty much any exterior polyurethane will work fine. 

The two problems are the unknown adhesive quality of the stickers and your coating sticking to the very smooth surface of the stickers. 
Any coating will stick better to the board than the stickers, but you can't change that. 
Look for a Krylon clear coat made for painting plastic. Those are formulated to bite into the slippery surface of plastic. Also would be good to rough up the sticker surface with 1000 grit sandpaper, or scotch brite pad or fine steel wool to help the adhesion."

Shifting to neutral and pressing the brake pedal uses the mechanical brakes. That wastes kinetic energy as heat. Normally the mechanical brakes only engage at the last few mph or under heavy braking.

Regening kinetic energy back to the battery has significant loses, so driving an even speed as much as possible, anticipating traffic lights will save energy. D is best for that.
