Work to build a true friendship with your wife! I'd recommend you two read the 7 principals for making marriage work. If possible read it again from time to time :), congratulations again!"

beginnerfitness,ff5agu3,t3_erpu05,1579585208.0,"It varies widely but some factors are your starting condition, previous physical activity, and how long it’s been if you do have a history. I started CrossFit about 5yrs ago with absolutely no fitness background or sports experience from HS. Those first months were tough but I stayed with it and it did get easier with time.

The reason why it’s so hard now is the very reason why many people choose not to do it or stop too soon. I promise that each day you put in is a day that gets your closer to that feeling you’re perusing! Don’t give up, and set small goals that will keep you chasing that carrot. Also try making small adjustments to what you eat if possible (small as in maybe just try to drink more water).

Be encouraging to others as well, once you get to that “good feeling” remember to help those that you meet who will be struggling with the same situation you find yourself in now.

TL;DR: I promise it gets easier! Keep it up and encourage others along the way!"

wholesomememes,fc9iohy,t1_fc8oqig,1577553236.0,"Just know you're not the only one out there, I hope my words are some comfort but I've found that doing something to help others helps me take my mind off my situation and gives a new perspective on my problems. Try to volunteer some time at the local rescue shelter or search for opportunities giving to the less fortunate. Those feelings of greyness will return but you will hopefully have a different perspective and joyful memories to combat those times. 

Hang in there, it's not easy but know there are others out there working though similar situations so you're not alone!"
