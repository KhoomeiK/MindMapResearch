To answer your question, I think it was a mistake to limit the tax deductibility of executive salaries to $1MM annually. This change led to the current trend of paying c-level employees primarily in equity. This shifted the incentives for leaders to value short term performance over the long-term survival and prosperity of the organization. 

Why would an American ceo care what happens 10 years down the roads after retiring and cashing out his $100MM in stock? To make it even worse, US based companies are required to report earnings quarterly compared to twice a year for Euro companies. If 95% of your compensation relied on an increasing stock price, you would be very tempted to sacrifice longterm stability and growth for rapid stock growth. This leads them to short sighted decisions such as mass layoffs of valued and experienced employees and burdening fewer workers with the same workload. This leads to high turnover, low loyalty to employers, decreasing average tenures at a particular employer, and many other issues.

In short, huge financial incentives to focus on short term results, harm long term growth and prospects. 

Also, in Euro corporations, the ""CEO"" isn't quite as powerful and management and ultimate decision making authority is typically more spread over a board of managers. Their ""CEO"" is typically the chosen head of this board and they have less absolute power than their US contemporaries. A much larger portion of their compensation is paid in cash and they get significantly smaller stock grants that can also vest over a longer time frame. There is also less use of stock options and other derivatives as co.compensation vehicles as well.

As for why investors in the US are ok with these pay packages, it is a bit more complicated. Fund managers are compensated on similar quarterly performance targets and equity analysts place immense pressure on US executives to maximize stock price. Also, board of directors are typically highly interconnected between other public companies and actively serving CEOs/Chairmen can serve on the boards of other companies simultaneously, so I imagine there is some quid-pro-quo going on within the compensation committees. Approve my high pay package and I (or my associate(s)) will return the favor when your contract is renewed.

There has been growing resistance from so-called activist hedge funds who seek to unseat and replace management teams that they feel are overpaid or enriching themselves at the expense of shareholders and employees. They typically acquire an ownership stake of at least 5%, obtain support from other large institutional investors, in hopes of waging a proxy battle to replace the current board of directors and management team with their own team. I feel this segment of the hedge fund industry has become an important check on the power of CEOs and Boards in the US. If they push things too far, investors with force them out and replace them with a carefully selected and more fairly compensated team of their own choosing.

Some european countries have legal limits on the pay ratio between the highest and lowest paid employees which can help mitigate excessive pay. Ultimately, I think the US's decision to limit executive compensation tax deductibility to the first million is what led us down this road in the first place. Before those changes took effect, you can see that executives were paid significantly less overall and received vastly smaller stock grants.They had higher cash based salaries, but less total comp. I think this period is going to have long lasting effects down the road when short term, profit maximizing decisions were made in lieu of sound and sustainable growth strategies to boost stock price during an executive's tenure. I believe the shortsightedness will come back to haunt these companies long-term.
