ketorecipes,feoee0v,t3_e1r4sh,1579299033.0,I made this last night and it was very delicious!
keto,fd733pv,t1_fd6zttm,1578198830.0,"Wasn’t thinking either. I figured I’d try since my roommate goes on about it. I’m figuring it out as I go. Originally, I came up with the above mentioned method when I lived with my parents where I knew I’d struggle carb wise. Learning to portion and changing eating habits was more important to me than actually losing weight. I moved out a few days ago. So now I have better control of the food around me."
keto,fd6ubwu,t3_ek764w,1578195814.0,Thanks for the input!  I’ll give keto it’s proper chance! Checking the about section did not occur to me! I’ll read up on the FAQs! I wasn’t sure how to go about it because there are some local delicacies that I’d have no idea how to calculate nutrition for. They’re mostly meat and blubber so I’m assuming keto wise it should be fine?
bulletjournal,fd66ndu,t1_fd61dm3,1578186292.0,"Kind of weird that I don’t have one since I love sharing what I create! So, I made an account. It is completely empty. I just made it. But I hope to start posting within the next day or two. My username is “[UnusualBujo](https://instagram.com/unusualbujo)” and thank you! The thought never crossed my mind and I’m glad you mentioned it!"
bulletjournal,fd509s9,t1_fd4kbni,1578172869.0,I’ve been bullet journaling for a bit over a year. A good amount of my spreads are artistic like this but I do have some months where I didn’t want to put in too much effort. Lol xD I do have an insta but I don’t post bujo photos on it.
bulletjournal,fd4z4if,t1_fd4o0g7,1578172609.0,Thank you! On one side I write my goal and on the other side I write down different ways to achieve it!
bulletjournal,fd4hoab,t1_fd4c0lh,1578167544.0,"It took me a week of working on it on and off. The only thing I planned what what spreads I was going to do. Design wise, I did it as I went. I just did it in pencil first. I did this free hand. I don’t like using a ruler, but the dot grid helps. Lol xD"
bulletjournal,fd449ck,t1_fd43ff2,1578164288.0,My January spread is MACUSA themed (from Fantastic Beasts/Harry Potter) and the dials are sticky notes of the the magical exposure threat level measurer! I got it from a stationery kit from my Wizarding World Loot Crate Box.
bulletjournal,fd3vc9y,t1_fd3t5wn,1578161952.0,"I used an Archer & Olive A5 Dot Grid Notebook with two Faber-Castell Pitt Artist Pens (exact pens are under another comment), and a Tombow Fudenosuke Hard Tip Brush Pen."
bulletjournal,fd3npsk,t1_fd3hqdv,1578160065.0,Thank you! I actually only went through one. I ran out while I was doing my brain dump spread. Which is why my rolling weekly spread is in my accent gold. xD
bulletjournal,fd3n74n,t1_fd3faqq,1578159899.0,The metallic gold one is Faber-Castell Pitt Artist Pen Gold 250 with a 1.5 nib. My accent gold is a Faber-Castell Pitt Artist Pen Green Gold (or Vert) 268 with a brush nib.
CaptainSparklez,fd2cyoo,t1_fd2c2ae,1578145423.0,"Each block is 128 pixels by 128 pixels, instead of the Minecraft’s normal 16 pixels by 16 pixels. For instance, a one block sized painting is 128 pixels by 128 pixels and a 2 block by 2 block painting is 256 pixels by 256 pixels."
CaptainSparklez,fcznccq,t1_fczn478,1578104990.0,It’s a 128x texture pack!
CaptainSparklez,fat1ttl,t1_fasyc6j,1576333823.0,Java Edition. Sorry!
