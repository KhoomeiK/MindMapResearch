CBD,ff3xudi,t3_ercrzl,1579551218.0,"I could actually believe this. I have always had chronic sinus and ear infections, getting one every 2-3 months and 99.5% of the time needing antibiotics for it. In the year I've been smoking, I've gotten sick twice, both after T breaks. No other lifestyle or health changes. I've never been this healthy for this long. I really hope we get to see more research into this."

Source: a senior in HS. Watched everything else get pulled out, my school sent out a link to the pizza thing explaining why it stayed and it's been at every school I've been to since."

saplings,fc7kt6v,t1_fc6edbo,1577510651.0,"If you don't mind me asking, how did you eat it after? Did you have to decarb it more? And how long did you hold it in the 110°c flat iron? I've always wanted to do this with bud but there's a lot of mixed messages about it."
offmychest,fc6avhm,t1_fc6ahin,1577476287.0,We tried all of it over the course of 20 years. Both stepping back and helping. He hit rock bottom more times than I can count. Sorry not everyone is so dead on the inside they're willing to just completely step away from their child and brother because they're struggling.
