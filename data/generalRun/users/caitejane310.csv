AmItheAsshole,feit943,t3_epa98w,1579146614.0,"Even though it's not something I talk about often, and only a few people who actually know me, know I had an abortion at 16. My state doesn't have counseling, but I had my mom with me and she was willing to support any decision I made. I still remember the protesters and the woman who got in my face trying to talk me out of it saying shit like ""you'll burn in hell for taking the life of an innocent child... A good Christian family would be able to raise my baby with Jesus in its heart..."" I just remember thinking she was crazy.

I digress, my point is that you're NTA. The random times I *have* talked about it to people other than my mother or SO (wasn't his child, didn't meet him until years later) was when I felt like my experience might educate the other person; whether it be ""it's ok to be scared and confused but still want to do it"" or ""I had one..."".

People seem to think it's like ""oh, I'm pregnant, time for an abortion"" but there's a lot of turmoil and self loathing involved, even for someone like you with a medical condition. 

I applaud you for shutting him up and if it's brought to HR do not be afraid to say he started it. Explain the whole conversation up to the point where you interjected yourself and your reasoning for doing so. If it's not brought to HR just move on with your life and let that guy just be an idiot who likes to mansplain."

This is definitely a lesson for you and your wife though. You probably didn't think much about them because you've probably never dealt first-hand with an addict. If you had, you probably would've put them somewhere less obvious/accessible than your medicine cabinet. If you ever get prescribed a painkiller and you don't finish them, put them somewhere like a safe or something. They're not bad to have around for people like you 2 who won't abuse them. Say you sprain your ankle and are having a hard time running after your child, take half a pill and continue with your day.

I digress, my point is that you're NTA.
