suboxone,ffj56hx,t1_ffiwrgr,1579990679.0,"Well technically you need to drink plenty of water to bulk the fiber up, because all opioids sucks water out of your stomach, that's why constipation is such a problem on all opioids.  It's also why water retention in your extremities is sometimes a problem on opioids, as well as urinary retention and difficulty initially urinating.

Everyone has valid viewpoints, while conversely harboring unhealthy viewpoints.  If everyone understood what everyone else' valid viewpoints were, then we could start to weed out the unhealthy ones.

When you have beliefs rooted in emotion, you can't take constructive criticism, or acknowledge facts.  Because doing so would cause a narcissistic injury.  This triggers emotional temper tantrums. 

Well, really I kind of got that backwards.  They can't take criticisms, or entertain a counterargument, because of the fact that someone who doesn't agree with their beliefs is the narcissistic injury itself. 

Some people need an enemy, someone to blame and place responsibility on for percieved mass injustices.  They're basically projecting the aggravation of their own insecurities on society itself.  Or parts of society they deem overly privileged.  

This is basically narcissism masquerading behind a cause that they feel is indefensible.  This is a malignant form of self empowering.  Because they feel that their beliefs are indefensible, it gives them a feeling of control and power in their own lives that is otherwise sorely lacking. 

People become less narcissistic as they grow older and mature more emotionally.  So most SJW's will eventually grow out of it.  Well the ones that don't already have an amalgam of several personality disorders anyway. 

People like this or people going through an SJW phase are largely toxic and are better to avoid until they grow out of it and come around later on their own.  Toxic gets thrown around a lot, but it fits a lot of SJW's.  They're not actually helping anyone or offering up solutions.  They're just looking for a fight."

Imo, I think it's the most balanced 2vs2 deck when playing with random teammate matches. 

These cards will compliment just about any deck your teammate might have.

At 3.6 elixir, it keeps the cycle cheap enough that you'll rarely have to wait too long to generate enough elixir to play an emergency card if you done screwed up a play. 

The play style for this deck is defense, or assist your teammates cards/push.  

But if I have a full elixir meter, and no one is dropping action, I'll play something for chip damage, or else drop GS in the back to start a push, if it feels safe to drop 6 elixir behind your KT, without getting lane rushed.

I put a shit ton of thought into crafting the best all around 2vs2 deck for random teammate matches.  And I'm happy with it.

ClashRoyale,fej8stg,t3_epfgxe,1579161843.0,"Simple strategy.  Cycle through your cheap cards. Don't build your main push at the start of a game. 
Cycle your cheap cards, let them go up against your opponents tower alone so you see what they drop to defend.  Then wait for their troop or push to get close enough to your side of the bridge to defend it. Defend their push, then continue cycling another cheap card and repeat. 

This way you can find out what your opponents win conditions are, and build up an elixir advantage from just defending.  

Once double elixir starts, make sure you don't start building your push, or using your main win condition strategy until they have played theirs. 

They got a Giant Skeleton, wait till its death bomb goes off before you attack.  Don't give your opponent a huge deathball of elixir to destroy with Giant Skeleton, Rocket unless it's out of their rotation. 

There's also rushing the other lane.  If someone drops a Golem, that's 8 elixir, you can rush the other lane with Hog Rider, Lumber Loon, Wall Breakers, Elite Barbs, or do chip with Dart Goblin, Goblin Barrel, Graveyard, or a ton of other cards before they generate enough elixir to defend.  By the time they defend you'll almost always get guaranteed damage. 

Also your free to use Giant Skeleton to.  Giant Skeleton used to be one of the worst cards in the game the first 2 years of CR, because it literally took that long for most players to realize that Giant Skeleton was always better as a defensive card.  

And the reasons you consider Giant Skeleton annoying is the exact reason why people use it, because you're using a win condition strategy that is probably annoying to your opponents, so in order to counter the strategy they find annoying, they are using Giant Skeleton, likely because you're using a good win condition strategy that is hard to counter with most other decks, Giant Skeleton just happens to be your kryptonite.  And every single deck has a counter deck that just destroys them. It's how the game is built.  Every card has hard counters, it's impossible to build a perfect deck.  

The only option against decks that counter yours good, is to use better strategies.

Also, that's called a positive elixir trade.  If you can kill a 12 elixir push with a 6 elixir card then you're playing the game right.   You should look for high value cards that defend efficiently & destroy or damage efficiently.

Example, Executioner is more efficient than Wizard.  Because Exe can eat a Fireball and keep fighting."

If you're 2vs2 playing style is assisting or complimenting your teammate's deck, this has been working pretty well for me. 

This is for random 2vs2 matches. 
I tried to build a deck that can work well with just about any random deck. 

My playing style is largely defending.  I usually don't try to initiate pushes with this deck, mainly just assist counter pushes with poison & arrows. 

I mainly use Giant Skeleton as a firewall to distract large pushes crossing the bridge. 

Mini-Pekka & LJ serve as tank killers & Hog & Ram killers. 

Log mainly for Goblin Barrels, occasionally on counterpushes. 

Dart Goblin to defend across lanes, occasionly for chip damage.  More often to assist larger counterpushes.  I use Firecracker in much the same way, but if I can help it, I like to save her to drop at the bridge once a large counterpush has crossed to utilize her splash against Minions & Bats.

Other cards I used in variations were Furnace, Tesla & Clone. 

I dropped Clone because after studying replays I found out that it isn't utilized very often, some battles I play it once, twice at the very most, and half the time I go a whole battle without using Clone at all.  So I just traded it it for Log. 

I used Furnace, but got tired of its limited value against air troops & splash troops.  The Fire Spirits are easily negated by the likes of Baby Dragon, Wizard and Electro-Wizard. 
So I traded Furnace for Tesla for its added air defense.  But I find most my teammates use 1 building in their deck anyway.  

I also go tired of how fast a Tesla can get destroyed, often times before it even has a chance to provide any defensive value.  

Edit*** I traded Firecracker for Ice Wizard***

Disregard***
So I traded Tesla for Firecracker, since Firecracker if not killed by spells right away can often live an annoyingly long time.  There's a trade off with how easy she can activate King Towers in 2vs2, but I figured it's a worthy tradeoff.  Disregard***

There's a lot of other cards I wish I could use in 2vs2, but they don't fit my 2vs2 defensive assisting playing style.  Cards like Balloon & Graveyard. 

Mainly because elixir regeneration is slower in 2vs2, so decks averaging anything over 3.8 Elixir feels very sluggish.  I try to use elixir efficient cards that provide good vaule but are powerful in some aspect, while keeping the deck fairly cheap.  3.6 feels cheap enough that you're never in the gray that long if you play your cards smartly. 

What I mean for the part about providing good vaule while being efficient, is that the cards have a high probability to net a positive elixir trade. 

For instance a Giant Skeleton can stop for the most part a 12 elixir push for 6 elixir. 

Arrows have the potential to kill a bunch of elixir, like say Minion Horde & Archers for 3 elixir.   

Mini-Pekka can quickly take down Giants, Bowlers or help take down cards like Golem a lot faster than a lot of other cards without dying to Arrows.  Same with LJ, but with the added vaule of death rage. 

Dart Goblin can often do enough damage before being killed by Arrows or Logs. 

Poison can do Fireball amount of damage on multiple buildings at once while helping to kill troops continuously with area denial.

Ice Wizard provides a ton of vaule defensively, and can easily negate large pushes with its splash radius when combined with other troops or spells.  High positive elixir trade probability."

First off, I made the first move, and stupidly played it aggressive, not knowing my opponents cards. 

So after my opponent's Golem deck took a huge damage lead, I made a smart play the next time he dropped his Golem. 

His Golem is 8 elixir, so I bridge rushed a Giant Skeleton with a Lumberjack pushing it, then cloned it, to push the GS on to his tower. 

At this point we basically traded towers on the left side.

After I damaged the majority of his tower on the right side, he bridge dropped a Golem and then a Wizard behind his Golem.  Since i don't rely on heavy damage spells to take out support troops, I used my Giant Skeleton as a firewall and dropped it in front of his Wizard but behind his Golem.  If I tried to defend the whole push from furthur back, his Wizard would have shredded my defense.  I mean it's a no brainer, but still it's easy to panic and forget to make the best obvious move."

It's the prestages of sleep paralysis.  Something that happens every time you sleep, but you don't notice because you're not consciously aware in sleep states.  That is unless you meditate to remain aware when entering that state. 

Every time you enter REM sleep, your brain produces it's own dmt which is responsible for dreams.

Next time it happens, relax your breathing more, and just listen to your breathing.  You'll eventually have an obe/astral projection."

What I know is that having an out of body experience/astral projection made me realize that some things defy current scientific explanation. 

I have numerous experiences. 

One afternoon I was meditating on my couch.  On this particular event, i wasn't fully aware of when I entered an altered state, but when it was happening I knew. 

I was meditating, lost awareness, then suddenly had a crystal clear vision of my cat chasing my ferret.  My ferret's supposed to be in its cage.  Anyhow, I saw my cat chase my ferret out onto our balcony/deck.  I immediately awoke, and thought holy shit, that felt incredibly real. 

I went down to visit my ferret in her cage.  But she was gone, I immediately remember the vision I just had.  So I went back up stairs and went onto the deck.  No sign of my ferret, so I lean over and look down, and there my ferret is, she was curled up in the wet grass with a broken hip from jumping off the deck to escape the cat.  Didn't know her hip was broken right away, but I knew something was wrong cause she wouldn't walk, so I took her to the vet, they xray'ed her and saw a hairline hip fracture.  She survived.  

I wouldn't have known where to look for her, if I didn't have that vision."

Meditation,fcnak94,t3_ehye1e,1577807440.0,"First few tips are lifestyle tips. 


If you can adjust and fit it into your life, switch to a polyphasic sleep schedule. 
Divided into 3 separate periods of getting your sleep. 

A good schedule is 11pm - 3am. 
An afternoon nap of about 1-2 hours. 
Then an evening nap of 1-2 hours.   But really, just any way that works to fit around your work schedule. 

This gives you more opportunities to meditate before going to sleep.  Use the main block of your sleep schedule for actually sleeping, try meditating during the shorter nap periods. 

Avoid regular use of mood altering substances. Drugs, weed, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine.  Eat a fairly healthy diet. 

Exercise to near exhaustion once a week, don't over exert, or exceed your limits though, no point in trying to kill yourself.  Also get light to moderate exercise in a few minutes every day. 

Challenge yourself in some way or choose a positive phobia/stressor and work to overcome it.  Like if you have a fear of public speaking, choose a hobby that challenges that phobia.  Could be anything, social anxiety, seeking a promotion at your job.  If your life is stagnant, your subconscious has less reasons to enter different states. 

Meditating tips to attempt obe's.

I'm sure most of you guys already know most of it. 

To begin, start with long deep inhales and exhales.  Pick a one word mantra or sound to say in your head, and say it slowly with your exhales.  

Once you start feeling tingly pin prick type sensations over most of your body, relax your breathing into a normal state, stop saying the mantra at this point, and just listen to the sound of your breathing. 

Before your meditation and during, just keep the thought in the back of your mind, that you want your body to go to sleep, but to keep your mind aware, at least aware enough to notice when you enter an altered state of conciousness.  In some ways, you want your mind to go to sleep, or a part of your brain.  You basically want to enter the REM phase, but remain or become aware when you enter it. 

While you're listening to your shallower relaxed state of breathing, let your mind go blank, let yourself drift off, but continue to listen to your breathing. 

That's basically it.  
Sometimes it helps to have ambient noises at low volume.  Usually some form of white noise.  Could be the sound of traffic on the highway.  Could be the sounds of the ocean or rain on your phone.  It needs to be background noise though, at low enough volume that it doesn't distract you from your breathing. 

When you start to have an OBE you'll know, the trick is to not get excited or freaked out when it happens, cause it can easily snap you out of it.  Just maintain the relaxed state that's getting you there.

Also if you do try a polyphasic sleep cycle, you can try meditating after your main sleep block.  Say your main sleep block is 4 hours. Set your alarm to wake after 3 hours.  Wake up, maybe have a drink of water and a sip of coffee.  Use the bathroom if you need to, then go straight back to bed, and skip the 1st part of inhaling and exhaling deeply.  You'll already be tired enough, to drift off back to sleep, just listen to your breathing, and let yourself drift off.  If you have an obe, then good, if not, doesn't matter you're back to sleep for another hour or 2."
