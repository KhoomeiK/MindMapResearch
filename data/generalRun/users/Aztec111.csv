relationships,fdx22ef,t3_en9ldr,1578764519.0,"I plan on keeping my maiden name for life no matter what. I have two kids and never married either father. I gave both my kids, a son then daughter, my maiden name. My thought was, I am not going to marry and I want my kids to have my last name. My son will carry on my name which is nice but even if my daughter gets married someday, I am glad we all have the same name right now. I know traditionally in the US men want their children to have their last name and even a lot of the women want their children to have the father's name. I think it's confusing for so many families to have different last names and I didn't want my kids to each have a different last name. They are five years apart and after 20 years now,  I am glad I gave my son my last name with my daughter to follow. 
If you plan on marrying him someday he will most likely want the kids to at least have his last name. You could try to compromise and do a hyphenated last name or give the kids your maiden name as a middle name. You could even hyphenate your last name when you marry. I am totally with you in wanting to keep my birth name :)"
