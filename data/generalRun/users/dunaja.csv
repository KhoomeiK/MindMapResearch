However, I don't believe price increases would be in line with higher salaries in any fair way. We live under a system of capitalistic greed. If the cost to Chick Fil A went up 25 cents per car, they would use the increased salaries as a PR campaign to raise the cost such that their profits would increase. (Also they'd have to cover the increased cost of slow business times when you're not doing much business but still paying your on-the-clock employees).

So yeah each full order would need to go up *at least* 25 cents but it would likely go up much much more, because prices go up at any reason corporations can think of.

Side note... I remember when ""small"" became the new standard size for combo meals and you had to upsize to a ""medium"". What a racket. Also when cheese became default on burgers, and you were charged for it unless you asked for it to come off (and even then some places still charged for it)."

Build up that anger again, run someone with a brain in 2024 on a platform of both ""we dumped Trump when he was past the point of no return"" mixed with ""god our current Democrat prez is terrible"" and they'd have a real shot at 8 Reagan-style or GWB-style years.

Cheating is wrong, and the Sox used replay footage to decipher signs. I get that. 

But that doesn't equate, in my opinion, to having players wearing buzzers that actually buzz on their bodies to alert them to the incoming pitch, or to use the entire audible trash can banging system. The Sox don't have the home-road splits that the Astros stars have that put things on an entirely different level.

Our manager was fired 90%+ for what he did as an Astro. The Red Sox stuff was icing on the crap cake of evidence against him.

If public opinion wants to put Red Sox fans in the same boat as Astros fans, I will accept that. I do think there's levels to this that should not be ignored, however.

As an add-on, this isn't really that important when it comes to cheating, but I fully believe that the Astros won *as a result of their cheating*, seeing as how they needed multiple game 7s and a lot of luck to squeak by, whereas the Red Sox basically dominated and lost only one game in each playoff series -- two of the three at home. Their only road loss was the 18 inning marathon. So whether they helped themselves or not I fully believe they win the 2018 series easily."

But I'm a teacher and let me say this -- I would bet you everything I own that 90%+ of the time I have let a child go to the bathroom, they didn't need to go and just wanted to kill time in the class period to reduce the demand placed upon them. I would also bet you every last possession of mine that at least 50% of the time I have let a child go to the bathroom, *they did not even make an attempt to pee or shit*. And that's not always a bad thing, sometimes we just need to step away and take a breath. But for some kids, it's ""water park time"" (yes they play with the toilets and urinals) and then, if I don't send them 3 minutes after I already sent them, they would likely piss themselves, because they didn't even consider whether or not they needed to go while they were playing in there -- it was all about ""play is more fun than schoolwork"". Except they don't piss themselves, because I send them every time, even that second time in 3 minutes, because not letting a kid go to the bathroom is fundamentally wrong.

The teachers that don't let kids go to the bathroom are wrong. Yes. But just be aware their reasoning isn't at all ""your need to use the bathroom is not as important as my lesson"". It is ""you don't need to go and would prefer to skip out, and if you stare into space or put your head down I will yell at you, but if you 'need to go to the bathroom' you're at no fault"".

You can 100% avoid 13 years of schooling via the bathroom method. Some of the children at my school spend the majority of their day in the bathroom.

I'm an elementary school teacher who sees every class in the school for 50 precious minutes a week. And when we are doing something hands-on, engaging, and fun, NO ONE ever, ever asks to go to the bathrooms ever.

And 80% of the class is hands on inquiry based fun. But there are times when we gotta read, and there are times when we gotta write. I work my ass off to make my class crazy fun, but there are times when the curriculum mandates that, even with the best, most creative effort, it's a teensy bit dry. Not for long, and not often, but such is life.

The steady stream (pun intended) of kids asking to bolt to the bathroom in these times is a total disruption. I only get them for 50 minutes a week, and if they don't love what we're doing, they demand the bathroom. Sometimes twice in that 50 minute span. And when a kindergartener or first grader sees one person go to the bathroom, they all have to go to the bathroom, guaranteed. I ask the homeroom teachers to make sure they go before they get to me, and they say they do. 

I let them go 100% of the time because not allowing people to go to the bathroom is indeed fuckin crazy. But Jesus Christ. I can tell you with certainty if the session is going to be completely destroyed by the bathroom. Oh, I'm requiring them to actually write something down? Bathroomapalooza time.
