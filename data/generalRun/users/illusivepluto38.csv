pcmasterrace,ff2c0gg,t1_ff2bews,1579500189.0,"Thanks a lot! I’m gonna use MSI mystic sync to make all the rgb to work the same.  I’m pretty proud of it for my first build, and that keyboard was only $50 bucks brand new.  While it isn’t mechanical it is a very nice membrane keyboard with some pretty cool features and high quality rgb I’ve come to expect from Corsair."
