AskUK,feeartv,t3_eom02y,1579029917.0,"I work in the public sector and I know a little bit about HR and employment law due to my role. I have only ever come across one person who had their references brought up as a reason for not getting the job, so you have been really unlucky.

I would see if there are any adult learning courses for job hunting because they are surprisingly useful. Also, if you have been to university, they can offer help and advice with job hunting.  

Good luck."
childfree,fdu2kzd,t1_fdrzee2,1578726399.0,"I know that I cannot cope with life if I am deprived of sleep and this is probably my main factor in never having children.

However, your baby is here now, so you both need to make the best of it. From friends who are parents, the following ideas seemed to have helped:

-teaching your baby to self-soothe/settle. This doesn't mean ignoring them but teaching them that they can get themselves back off to sleep on their own.

-splitting the feeding with your partner e.g. one of you does one night, the other the next night. This works best if you have another room you can use so the one 'off duty' gets uninterrupted sleep.

-getting a babysitter or family member to have the baby for a weekend so that you and your partner can reconnect. Even if this is just spent sleeping!

-if you can afford it, pay for help with your house e.g. cleaner, gardener. This will take a bit of pressure off.

I would also recommend you both getting some therapy if you can."

AskUK,fcmyvyh,t1_fcmxp0n,1577798084.0,"Your mental health is a valid reason to see your GP. I am sorry to hear you are being made homeless, I hope you are getting support from the appropriate authorities. You can also talk to Citizens Advice about getting back on your feet."
cats,fckzbc9,t3_eho3ij,1577736419.0,"So sad to read this. In my experience, the knowledge that you need to help your pet pass and the waiting is often the worst bit.  I have always felt a sense of relief (although I am still devastated) that they are out of pain. The procedure itself is not as horrible as you anticipate it might be, it's horribly sad but my experience of it has always been that the vet was very kind to both of us and it's peaceful in an odd way. You clearly love him and you have done right by him. Lots of hugs x"

cats,fckgqzl,t3_ehkqrg,1577724965.0,"What a lovely looking cat and very lucky to be so well loved by you. I think that the passing of any pet who has seen us through so many important life events is always particularly hard, they're woven into your history. Lots of hugs xx"
