TrueOffMyChest,fgv42ac,t3_f08naa,1581136539.0,Should have became an engineer or entered the medical field. Everything else is fucking useless and low paying.
antiwork,fgtxp6v,t3_f04q93,1581110801.0,"That’s why I like state and federal jobs, no bullshit, clock in, clock out."
politics,fgsm2nv,t3_f09hlx,1581087664.0,Teachers don’t deserve that kind of money. Keep paying millions to athletes though.
Neverbrokeabone,fgsc4d7,t3_ezzv7n,1581080048.0,So technically if you broke that bone would it still really count since it’s not really part of your skeletal system?
Eldenring,fgpf7rf,t3_eztaiu,1581003603.0,I hope this game is really a game.
Sekiro,fgm4ufy,t1_fgm0bh9,1580918018.0,"I know. It sucked for me too, I ended up dropping it for a couple of months before platinuming it. There might be better farming strats at this point so maybe browse YouTube. I ended up playing it two more times because it was easier and more enjoyable to keep beating the bosses. Just take your time and keep coming back to it if that’s what it takes."
antiwork,fgkwu0s,t3_ez2flh,1580875497.0,Easy question. Show up and just do less work. That simple.
careerguidance,fgkwj7d,t3_ez1zi7,1580875282.0,First off what do you mean you get spooked? What’s happening in your interviews?
modafinil,fgkwexh,t3_ez2298,1580875197.0,"It can be used as an off label use for ADHD, yeah, but from the research I’ve seen, it’s no where near as effective for treating ADHD. Talk to your doctor and see if lines up, especially if your ADHD is mild."
antidepressants,fgjgabx,t1_fgjeoas,1580843429.0,"Oh trust me, there’s definitely other causes, I may have had a suspected mono infection a couple of months ago and I could be going through post viral syndrome. I’m just not sure if the Zoloft is making it worse, I feel like I should try Wellbutrin."
antidepressants,fgivivj,t3_eycvw5,1580831821.0,That doesn’t sound like side effects from antidepressants at all.
depression,fgibcjw,t3_eyodyf,1580815270.0,There’s specific surgery for Endo. Look into that.
Mononucleosis,fgeh032,t1_fgebfg8,1580699309.0,I’m so confused. Your EBV is inactive now? What levels?
Mononucleosis,fg87ovo,t3_ew5wma,1580611723.0,Wouldn’t it be month 4 of EBV. Mono only lasts like a week or two.
Lyme,fg70733,t1_ffwus9z,1580580933.0,How high is your EBV?
todayilearned,fg54fe2,t1_fg44bxl,1580518008.0,Well what causes appendicitis and the need to remove it? Why do some people at varying ages have it get fucked up?
todayilearned,fg548nc,t1_fg3ppni,1580517876.0,Yup. You won't live past 50. Sorry.
todayilearned,fg546gp,t1_fg3odje,1580517834.0,Get hit hard how? Digestive issues or what?
todayilearned,fg53uni,t3_ewqbty,1580517603.0,"Based on what I'm reading, I won't live past 50."
Mononucleosis,fg05a83,t3_etygkk,1580400519.0,"I'm in a similar situation too. I'm trying to narrow things down because either I had a past infection or a tick borne illness. I'm feeling better than I did last month, but the fatigue is still very real. I would try to get at least 12 hours a sleep if possible. Aim for that so you can at least get 9 hours."
personalfinance,fg01t4u,t3_evcbhl,1580398322.0,"I actually had another piece of advice for you OP. Something that people don't actually talk about but really encapsulates the whole idea of retirement, but basically, if actually get to 65, that means the situation you are in probably works, so x amount of money you have saved up won't be an issue at that point, you see that is really the whole point of retirement imo, you actually make it there lol, and to make it there, things have to go well for you, so if you make it there, that means your situation is fine depending on any number of variables.  It's a little morbid, but I do believe it is the truth. 

That's why I am a big proponent of living in the moment by enjoying things now and trying to balance the future. Having an overall goal is great, but seriously think about a candle that burns half bright for 80 years vs a candle that burns fully for 40 years. You tell me which life is better. That's the trick my friend. Don't get caught up in the numbers too much, and since you're 30 and now just realizing a new reality, I don't think they mean a lot to you, you're only just now being scared into having to make it a goal because you probably dont have a choice anymore, just relax or you'll miss out on a lot. You're already ahead of a lot of people now even at 30."
nba,fg00px3,t3_evu7pu,1580397614.0,"This is really the last detail that needs to be discussed, and I doubt it will be or ever found out, but surely there was someone that was against  the weather conditions and said this is a bad idea. So it really boils down to the pilot being confident and telling Mr. Byrant it will be fine, or Kobe demanding they go anyways against the risk. And you wouldn't want to look like a bitch in front of Kobe."
Mononucleosis,ffy7muc,t1_ffy3swt,1580340137.0,Any advice?
Mononucleosis,ffy7lrd,t1_ffy3swt,1580340119.0,"I’ve been feeling something, that’s for damn sure."

LateStageCapitalism,ffv6p56,t1_ffv5pvd,1580256974.0,What movie?
personalfinance,ffv1728,t3_evcbhl,1580253326.0,You’re fine OP.  It really depends on the lifestyle you want to live to figure out if you are actually screwed.  Just make sure you have your Roth on top of your 401k and you really can’t go wrong.
nihilism,fftggvy,t3_ev3wnd,1580219854.0,"Yeah, that’s a pretty cool explanation and sums it up well. We’re going to need definite answers at some point, because only then can we try to achieve real peace and harmony."
antinatalism,ffr4p4v,t3_eurmts,1580150395.0,"I knew a girl that has this condition. It’s basically really hard to get pregnant with it, and she was sad that she couldn’t be a mother. She had to get the surgery to help with the pain, and the surgery itself decreases the chance of pregnancy on top of it, and that’s not even mentioning she was already 36. Basically never going to have kids."
