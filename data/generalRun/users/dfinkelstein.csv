Brawlstars,fe0wi6y,t1_fdvsuei,1578819555.0,"This is why the mode is nonsense. They used a 3v3 balancing mechanic in a free for all mode. It makes **no sense**. In 3v3, bounty stars serve as a snowballing mechanic and a comeback mechanic. If you get three kills, then die, your team is still up by two stars, or no more than one kill. The more kills you get without dying, the harder it is for the other team to come back, because they can't just kill you alone to do it.  At the same time, the accumulation of stars means that if your teammates get a kill and then die, this gives the other team one star up on you every time it happens. Which means that if you're getting all the kills and your teammates are getting 0-1 kills, then dying, that the other team needs only kill you to potentially come back. Brilliant design. Very elegant. I love it. 
   
In a free for all death match, this mechanic means that every kill rewards you 2-7 stars. Randomly. It's nonsense."

Isn't that good design, though? If you're not going to add a volume slider, then of course you'd make the volume as loud as possible. That way you can always hear the app no matter what. And nothing else.  
  
Anyway, do you have any idea how special it is to not have a volume slider? Every other application and game I've ever used on any device in my life had one.
