I can’t remember the details of what she said, but it didn’t come off horrible in her depiction. She doesn’t really deny anything but the severity. 


I think you’re right that since Corinne likes Bob she’ll underplay it and Kenny hates Bob so he’ll overplay it. Meaning that Sugar and Crystal are going to be our sources that are most reliable, but neither are terribly trustworthy either due to other circumstances that attack their character. Which is terrible. (Drugs and emotional instability for Sugar and the Olympian Scandal for Crystal) although I would find Crystal to be the most trustworthy on the subject of the four of them. 


But ultimately I think that there is some truth in what Kenny is saying, but is filtered a bit more extreme due to his immaturity at the time and how it’s still pinned to bob, while Corinne does the same thing in the opposite way."

Lauren benefits in her reaction here for a few reasons, the first is that the survivor community tends to gravitate towards women as their favorites and the sassier the better. We also have a tendency to search for the breakout new players in a mixed season of old and new players. 


Lauren ended up being the only newbie girl that was in the majority of the messy Manu/Lesu tribe so that gave her enough airtime for her to be noticed and have a storyline throughout the game. Lauren also found an idol which was something people could latch onto as well. So Lauren was the only newbie woman who was given enough airtime to have any chance of winning.

We get a few backstage clips of her that the edit can’t help because it’s at a pivotal moment. Her whole Randy tribal council is her at her most backstage. She calls him a loser when she votes him out and then laughs so hard that she falls out of her seat when Randy uses the fake idol.

changemyview,fcyoorb,t1_fcymwlg,1578084003.0,"Having an A,B, and C plot is very difficult to do on a 22 minute show. 



The problem with keeping Cory and Eric away from each other is that it divorces Eric so much from the main character that it would be pointless to even keep him in anymore. At that point you’d be better off with a spin-off. And since  EJR was a slightly altered copy of CST that asks what happens if our original group met later in life. (Eric is Cory, Jack is Shawn, and Rachel is Topanga) it would be an unnecessary spinoff since we already have those characters. 


The EJR setup is propelled by CST (mostly Jack and Shawn) but is grounded to the reality of the show through Eric and Cory. 


Keeping Cory at home would keep Morgan in the show and give Amy and Alan a bigger role, but you’d then either need to lower Eric’s age or cut him completely. But when they needed to make the choice of losing Eric or Morgan, it was a clear choice that Will was a stronger actor and Eric was more of a defined character. 


That’s why you need to lower Eric’s age, and tie him to Jack (who you tie to Shawn). That way, everyone is kept together."

changemyview,fcyfj2p,t3_ejha40,1578079329.0,"One of the biggest issues with a television show is making sure it never gets stale. The problem with a show like BMW is that there is a set path that it tracks along with (your school life) and you can only get so many similar stories out of that track before things get boring. 


But it’s important to note that BMW wasn’t only about school life, I’d be willing to say that it’s more focused on family and how one defines it. While Morgan, Eric, And the Parents are Cory’s family, the show is always trying to tell us that a family is more than biological. Shawn is Cory’s family. Mr. Feeny is family. Topanga is family. BMW is telling us that we define what a family is. 




But since BMW is also about school, we needed to make sure that all of Cory’s family is connected to school as well. Eric was too old and Morgan was too young to stay connected to Cory and his school life. This meant that both no longer made any sense to have around in the show because they didn’t offer anything. Eric wasn’t the cool brother that was around in school scenes and Morgan was quickly aging out of being a cute little girl and going through her tweens would be repetitive and take away from CST.  The writers needed to do something to keep the Matthews family together in some way, because the family being tight and next door to Feeny was central to the show. 


So they needed to send Morgan upstairs since she couldn’t offer much to the story anymore and they needed to tie Eric closer to Cory so they can always stay tied together. If not for keeping Eric and Cory closer in age, the show is no longer about family and what defines a family, it’s about friends sticking together and you lose the family theme. 



TL;DR: BMW is about the many ways people join your family framed around a school aged boy. Aging up Cory both keeps Eric around as the bridge of family and friend and also let’s us fast forward to the more exciting parts of high school life."
