2) After that, I will install FreeNAS on it and make a media center out of it. 

My short term goals are:
1) Have a really feel the potential of the hardware. That is, install the adequate drivers and configure what needs to be configured. I have a spare GPU to install in that system, but if I can avoid, I would gladly (it creates some other issues for me). So I want to know if I can use 1080p natively. If I believes the doc, I should be able. 

2) I have some other goals, but that will come after: monitor the temperatures (I have my doubts on the cooling capacities); learn and transition towards a server setting; secure the connection; etc...

[edit] I’m gonna delete my post and rephrase it tomorrow. The issue might be deeper, since I had multiple networks issue during install. I sound like I want to make a Christmas tree out of the distro, while it’s not exactly that. I want to get into concrete diagnoses of what can be done. But I have installed Debian 3 hours ago and I haven’t installed any packaged yet, or done any significant things. My reading is sterile because I do not understand what I should think about each repo, and if it translates to the packages inside those. (Like WireGuard for instance: it’s in ""Unstable"". Does that mean it will be unstable with my system? Or does it means there is security issues that have not been audited?)."

Nietzsche,ffqjkdu,t1_ffqilce,1580136364.0,"Wow, you had me look back at the wiki and you are correct (I wasn't far though ahah).

He indeed was some kind of a nurse (an ordrly to be exact) during the Franco-Prussian war (1870). There was a time in 1867 where he was in an artillery regiment and got hurt while mounting his horse though. It's there that he was judge very competent, but it is NOT there that made him reflect and write *The Birth Of Tragedy*. 

What's more surprising to me is the fact he renounced his Prussian nationality! I *need* more information about that!
Also, the wiki contradicts you: it says he was stateless the rest of his life. Maybe it is the Basel university that forbid him any active duty?
That would be good to know for sure.

Diphtheria and Dysentery aren't especially bad disease though. Of course it was more dangerous in 1870, especially during wartime, but it's still pretty okay imo. 

Do you have more info about his relationship and thoughts with Prussia before 1870?"
Nietzsche,ffqewfl,t3_eumteu,1580132538.0,"I think that it would be wrong to say ""if someone is quagriplegic, then it is impossible to love life"". 

The reason for that is symmetrical with our skewed sense for moral. If I am handicapped (physically or any other kind), a big part of me feels flawed, wronged, ashamed, or other negative reflection of the situation. But nevertheless, there will also be a part of me that rejoice about that suffering that I am experiencing, and even a part of me that will completely revel in my ""particularity"". We all have a twisted side. 

It’s only reasonable after all. Pain is always a challenge, a two-fold bet: I must win over myself, and I must win over others. The pure ""suffering"" part (the symptomatic, bodily expression) is an echo of our judgment over ourselves. But we all keep in the back on our mind that the injured beast is the most dangerous. In fact, getting rid of our sufferings is particularly difficult for that reason: we think it is an advantage. 

Nietzsche talks about it at length, but use the ""moral predicat"", which is the external apparence of that internal conflicts. ""Good is awesome, but bad is necessary to strengthen the good."" Like... no shit Sherlock?!! That’s been said by literally every one since men talk. Plus, it would literally be a non-issue if evil was useful, unless it causes issue internally, right? So of course Nietzsche is using a ""proxy"" to talk to us about our psyche. 

So. As I said, first challenge is to confront our bad habits to makes ourselves suffer, with the more-or-less unconscious goal to give us a desire for vengeance. 

But in second, there is also the fact that we LOVE being handicapped, because the externalizations of moral made flaws/injury a ""benefit"". I mean not directly but indirectly this time. If society is used to value something (for initial good reasons) so much that it forgot what was really valued (and indeed, it is not being handicapped that is valued, but to be strong after defeating said handicap), then we have an ""excess"" of beneficiary judgment, undeserved judgment. 

I have talked about ""handicap"" so far, and I hope you didn’t imagine I was talking only about literal physical handicaps. Every set-back in life OR advances contains a hardship. Imagine someone becoming famous. Notoriety is definitely a strength in our society. But the systematic, general, and massive shift from individuals considering themselves all of the sudden ""inferior"" compared to you, whereas maybe a month before not even one of them would have let you think you were more than average, using for that  all the cunning arguments their guts would find. That’s an aweful things to live honestly. Not because people that get famous should complain, but because you *have to* bend your inner senses to adjust to that reality. If not, then you will fall into cruelty, narcissism, misanthropy, etc... And since you don’t only have the general public to deal with, but your close ones, then you can imagine how imperious a need each one of us have to reach balance. 

All of that to show that someone that suffers, AND that is publicly in a situation of suffering will have challenges. 

The reason we can have an impact on our lives is because we are squished into different evil: suffering and using our suffering; and also  showing distress and showing we manage our distress. 

We have things to balance and explore those different reality. We are *always* lying to ourselves, sure. But we get to learn *something* when we move around."

Nietzsche,ffpwqw4,t3_eujg8l,1580108754.0,"I think it is pretty irrelevant, personally. It’s not that it would not impact his philosophy, but I understanding what he tells us is already a very interesting task. Why search for flaws in the man prior to that ""agreeable"" understanding? He wrote many books, they were intended for you. But it’s not enough and you need to look for personal infos even further, despite the fact that ""illness"" is a subject he talks about. 

It’s like you meet a woman/man, and the first thing you do is trying to diagnose mental illnesses. 

I’m sorry to be harsh, but labeling a mental state with the word ""disease"" is already something that repulse me. It’s not that it’s wrong, but it betrays a materialistic epistemology that I can’t stand, as it is deshumanizing and objectifying subjects. Personal experiences make me wary of that opinion. And since you do not define what you think PTSD is, it is hard to expect we would agree, or that you’re using Nietzsche definitions. Keep in mind that for him, illness was something that needed to be overthrown. 

Nietzsche only talks about the war’s effects on his psychology and writings one time, in the preface he re-wrote in 1886 for *The Birth Of Tragedy*. There might be other mentions ofc, but not in a way that shows his intimate reaction. (Again, I might be wrong). Those 1886 prefaces are great material to go into his mental state. 

In this particular one, he hints that before the war, his mind was working non-stops to find an ""answer"", or something. Like his unconscious was structuring his thought for the hardness to come. It created *The Birth Of Tragedy*. In a way, it is admitting that his philosophy was responding to that need. 

Saying he was ""PTSD"" might be true or it might be false, it actually doesn’t say *anything*. It just puts a label with symptoms, external observations. In Nietzsche’s writings, you’ve got an *actual* rendering of the path a mind might take when confronted to atrocities. I think it is insensitive to try to diagnose, since you try to answer ""yes"" or ""no"" to a question. Black, or white; working, or broken; corrupted, or pure; weak, or enduring. That duality is the lowest possible understanding there is. It would only be useful if you were wanting to give someone a drug. That is, not to ""heal"" him, not even to understand him. You would say ""he’s loosing his mind, he’s irrational. It must be fixed"". But the mind of a soldier, doesn’t it have to answer to the most vivid theodicy to keep being stable, hopeful, reasonable?"

Those texts were written with symbols, images, etc... One word doesn’t have one meaning, or one translation. It has been chosen because it reflects an experience in all its polysemy. Now if you go with a scientific mindset into religious matters, you’re far too narrow to be convinced, since you only can accept one incidence, and the rest you would probably dismiss as coincidental/redundant.

blackmagicfuckery,ffij5vg,t1_ffi4nqw,1579975124.0,">Science is not the nature of what is, but the use of a coherent framework and measurement in order to explain nature.

Science doesn’t explain, it describe. But ok. 

Knowledge is a wider category than science; everything that is known is not necessarily know by ways of science. For instance, everything that exists can be quantified one way or another. That means you can give a numerical characteristic to each thing and event. But that doesn’t mean you know the event in itself. You just know ONE side of that thing. And you can know personally that same thing without any use of mathematics. If you have 1 or X measurement of a thing, then you know 1 or X facts about that thing, and every knowledge you call ""scientific"" beyond the X measures is actually plain intuition. In other words, when you say that science is a ""coherent"" framework, you just project your trust for science into the scientific theory. 


>Ergo to suggest that science must be distinct from magic is to suggest that a celebration of magic is a celebration of ignorance; 

That’s actually a tautological reasoning, but it’s seducing because of the previous point: You say science is coherent, so it can explain everything; if it can explain everything, then what is not explained is just in a state of lack of explaining. You created a world that has value by difference, by default: what has not been proved is in a deprecated state, not yet fulfilled. 

Bit it’s actually the opposite. Everything that exists exist in plain and is already ""perfected"" as much as possible. Science just comes to describe, and not explain. It has no justificative value whatsoever. What we call Magic is in fact just a type of engineering, and engineering is at the center of science, since it is the heart of experimentation. So... magic doesn’t have to be set in the same category as ignorance, and definitely not ""opposed"" to science. 

> Therefore to preserve the essence of magic, one should accept that we will always try to explain nature with science

Again, you put things in the wrong order: it has no sense that we will always explain nature with science, since science is the explaining of nature by definition. You’re just stating that the definition of a word will always be correct. 

> unintuitive phenomena there will be a scientific study of it - the subject of study should be no less wonderful for this.

That’s the whole point that makes OP’s post valuable in my opinion. Unintuitive phenomena will be explained, drawn, clarified, yes. But if the explanation isn’t rooted in man’s ingenuity, but only in some basic property of a compound that is displayed, then it has no place in this sub. If someone uses explosive powder in a scientific setting testing, it’s boring; if someone uses the same explosive powder but I cannot guess easily that he used that because of cunning, then it is interesting."

I know it was a big debate throughout Christian history though. Salvation was thought to be conditioned by Grace, but whether Grace was innate or not was not interpreted the same by everyone.

Also, I’m pretty sure there some metempsychosis in the Christian tradition, *somewhere*. 

Personally, I see the myth of reincarnation as purely symbolic : it represents the process of birth of a desire, death of a suffering, etc, etc... I don’t deny those other meanings though, including the literal one. It’s just that it doesn’t help in any way to know you had a previous life or that you’ll have a next one. It doesn’t help neither to know that you are at X point of your liberation process. You already know it since you *are* that X point.

I studied a little Indian Astrology for a time, and it is linked with many myths. It goes over the cycle of reincarnation, step by step. During that study, I learned that hardship in life gives sufferings, and that suffering is the event that one must learn to reverse. 

Indian Astrology, if you get out of the way any expectation for predilection, is a great science btw. It’s an ancient practice that is rooted in the vedas, and Brahman had to learn, according to the texts, if they wanted to purify themselves. And it really makes a lot of sense when you learn the ideas in it. Astrology was the art of keeping time, in the most ancient civilization. It was a way educated people could witness how long lasting and perfectly attuned the cosmo was. Some planets cycle every 80 years, some every 50, some every 5 years, some every few months. And then the Sun, the Moon and the Earth itself gives you the landmarks on the season, the month, the weak and the time of the day. So it was logical for the ancient to derive from that art a system to help you live in the present moment. Then the signs appeared, which was a symbolic path through enlightenment, in 12 steps, because there was 12 new Moon in a year (which is the reason for our 12 months). And after that yearly cycle, with a psychological evolution from birth to detachment, everything would start all over again, in a brand new year. 

So there is obvious links to the cycle of reincarnation. I didn’t go into the myth part of Astrology, but I would definitely advise a quick read about the Churning of the Ocean of Milk, which is central in hindi Astrology. It’s a cosmological myth basically, with the idea of cycle being very present, and some references to ""poison"" (as in ""sufferings""). 

Usually I like to relate to something into Buddhism when I study though. For that reason, I wanted to understand how the cycle of reincarnation was thought by the Buddha."

I agree you could have bad and unfair consequences for taking sick days. And that sucks, I agree. 

But sometimes we fall ill because we feel uneasy in our current life. Our body is talking to us. The fact that you’re resenting ""feeling guilty"" for not going to work, that makes me think you’re looking at the tree that hides the forrest.
