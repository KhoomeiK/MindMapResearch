MurderedByWords,fcue8nk,t1_fcudlsd,1577978880.0,"Insurance will not solve any of those issues. I am sorry it's been so difficult for you. All that insurance would do is make you responsible for part of the cost. It would not decrease provider wait times. Due to the very small amount that insurance companies pay doctors, doctors have to take even more patients. This increases the demands on clerical staff. Insurance doesn't oversee provider skills or fact check diagnosis unless they want to disprove a claim. Insurance is only involved once the harm is done. Customer service in the US is abysmal with hospitals suing the parents of cancer patients and taking their homes. 

I completely understand why you are disappointed and why any other system looks better.

After the treatments and the tests (cts, biopsies, breathing studies) to find the root causes; I still paid $7,000 out of pocket to get healthy again.

The general problem with insurance companies is the definition of insurance: the goal of an insurance company is to take in more in premiums than they pay in claims.

It actually seems like they might tow the line, when NY state announces we will not elect Schumer ever again if a few R senators make this happen. McCain takes the leadership, holds the most meticulous senate impeachment trial that human society will ever see. 16 senators, 40 house members, 117 lawyers, and 775 judges are indicted on charges of fraud, bribery, and foreign influence as a result of evidence from the impeachment trial.
