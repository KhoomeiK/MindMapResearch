college,fcyhlnd,t1_fcyhebb,1578080293.0,"It's insane how unattainable top private schools are for upper middle class families. Low income students by far receive the most generous financial aid, and for the ultra wealthy the price tag is no issue.

Happy to hear your son has such an awesome opportunity at an awesome public school."
college,fcygf0o,t1_fcxqk34,1578079665.0,"The concept of a dream school is something even someone like me from an upper middle class american home has a complete disconnect with, even I just had to pick the best school that would work out financially.

It took me a really long time to get over the fact that I was attending a semi local state school instead of my ""dream school"" I was supposed to have that's high up on college rankings.

The only thing that eroded my desire to be at a more ""prestigious"" school or whatever was realizing how much opportunity I have where I'm at- opportunity that became much more accessible when I maximized every resource available to me and worked harder."
