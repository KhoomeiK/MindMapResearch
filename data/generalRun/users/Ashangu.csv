2007scape,ffc84ml,t1_ffbwqc1,1579793721.0,"I disagree with the castle wars statement. The rush of knowing you could lose everything is a lot of the fun in pking. From what I recall, the pking hot spot back in the day was in between green drags and dark knight castle and sure, it had a lit to do with green drags being a hot spot for pvmers, but it be came a staple in pvp to go there because you could always count on a pker being there trying to kill a pvmer.

 On busy days, the spot would move to the front of the castle and no one gave a damn about the pvmers. It was all about the excitement of a good fight.


Even then, the reward was another players items, not items + points for free hand outs tha can equal close to one of the higher money makers in the game lol."
2007scape,ffc5qzi,t1_ffbvfxc,1579792165.0,"Because pvp requires like 5 minutes of gameplay setup to achieve the same rewards as killing something like zulrah with absolutely 0 effort. And pvp bots ruin the content for other players where as zulrah bots dont effect the content.


You can create 20 accounts and bot them for an hour all at the same time to get them setup to abuse the fuck out of the whole game. You would have to bot hours on hours to abuse zulrah, or at least buy accounts. Either way, pvp is always going to be easier when you set up accounts that fight each other without the other fighting back.


Imo, pvp is rewarding as it should be without the extra shit. It isnt supposed to be a ""money maker""."

My biggest fear is the chiro making things worse. 


Its manageable now, some days are bad for no reason. Constant neck pain and I can literally just look the wrong direction and pull a muscle somewhere usually near my shoulder blades.

I have drug multiple deer out of the woods, I have hung multiple deer and skinned them, it's a family tradition. I've never gotten a tick from a deer. 

My great aunt has a sanctuary with close to 50 deer that you can feed and pet but they do live in the wilderness of something like 200 acres of land, she also has elk in a different section of sanctuary. I've never got a tick from a deer.


I was not saying they do not carry ticks. But they are not just INFESTED like everyone makes them out to be. You are 1000% more likely to pick up a tick walking through brush. You are just as likely to pick up a tick on literally any kind of wild animal as you are a deer but the ONLY time tick gets mentioned is when there is a deer.

That was my point. They ""live"" on the animal when they are feeding and once they are latched they stay latched for days at a time. They breed thousands of eggs at a time at ground level and spread like wildfire through brush waiting for someone to latch on to. They dont just hang out on deer waiting for humans to come by. It's a lot more rare than people think.
