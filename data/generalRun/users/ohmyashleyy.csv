reactjs,ffiizvc,t1_ffi2efr,1579975012.0,"I’ve done it. We had a react page in a legacy site, with a corporate ui library that used a lot of vanilla JS and jQuery so we had no choice. Also used it for Ajax because it was already on the page. I’ve also used it for some basic DOM manipulation where it was easier, at the time than passing around all the necessary props and state. 

I wouldn’t do it *now* but it was 4 years ago and it was simpler coming from a jQuery way of thinking."

I can drink coffee in the car or when I get to work, but I want to get in as soon as possible so I can leave as soon as possible."
