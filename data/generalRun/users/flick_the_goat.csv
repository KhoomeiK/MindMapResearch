MrRobot,fdorpif,t1_fdmzijs,1578611394.0,For real. Why they gotta hit ALL the feels!?!?
BipolarSOs,fdomlh8,t3_elm1gy,1578608220.0,"There was a post a few weeks back. It literally just went generic. Not sure how/if this helps with the cost, but be sure to ask about it. 

FWIW - I was on it three years, and I did the discount card the entire time. I paid $15/month with insurance."
AskReddit,fdm9ogy,t1_fdm1mgr,1578543308.0,Same fam. Same. 41 here. Keep fighting the good fight!
MrRobot,fdlo175,t1_fdl3lf9,1578528398.0,Yep! With his arm in a sling!!
MrRobot,fdlnmxi,t1_fdl1h9t,1578528128.0,"Ok. Shamed to admit this made me tear up. I love the concept of leaving “don’t delete me” notes for myself. Sorry - probably so obvious for everyone.... 

Regardless, thank you for posting."
MrRobot,fdln8th,t1_fdkzboc,1578527869.0,Congrats!!
BipolarSOs,fdlgi8p,t1_fdihm54,1578523521.0,"Oh for sure. LOTS of things are GREAT ideas when hypomanic. Like “why on earth wouldn’t I do this?” type great ideas. 

There is medication that can lessen / stop manic episodes from occurring, but (big disclaimer) TO MY KNOWLEDGE there is not a medication that will stop an ongoing episode. It isn’t like you can take 2 Tylenol when you get a headache. 

Prolonged sleep is the biggest thing that will stop my episodes, but even with Ambien, it is very hard to come by. It’s almost like my brain needs time to reset."
PublicFreakout,fdicy1w,t3_elj6uy,1578440074.0,Shoe down! Someone ded.
MrRobot,fdi72v6,t3_elepe0,1578436893.0,"Probably biased because it showed up at the end, but Outro. STILL listening to it..."
BipolarSOs,fdhfw5o,t1_fdf804l,1578421784.0,"This may sound stupid, but I don’t know when I’m manic or hypomanic. At the time, the purchases just sound like a great idea. 

My wife will gently point out when she see’s me becoming hypomanic. At that point I can say “Ok, I’m hypomanic, so I need to chill with the online purchases.” This generally works when I’m hypomanic. 

Sometimes, she will just list in great detail my packages that have arrived. She doesn’t pass judgment, she’s just “politely” letting me know about all of the packages. Once I see her text with the list, I’m like “oh shit.” 

When I get truly manic (rare for me), I generally believe my wife and others are out to get me, so obviously this approach won’t work. 

I honestly haven’t found much that helps me when I’m truly manic. Just gotta wait for it to end. 

I will say though, just generally (gently) being reminded from time to time that I’m manic helps. A few months ago, I was going through a full manic episode and I was absolutely convinced my wife was cheating on me and was bad mouthing me to her friends. (Neither were true)

My wife asked “I don’t know, but could it be you’re manic? Maybe that’s why you think this?” 

It totally snapped me out of it. I was still manic, but I was able to let go of that “battle.”

Sorry - I’m sure this isn’t much help."

Hang in there, OP."

Thanks for sharing your story! I really hope you get through the wait list and are able to get the therapy you seek. 

All the best, OP!!"

BipolarReddit,fd0lphn,t3_ejq7op,1578120574.0,"There are far more eloquent threads here describing how this relates to BP, so I’ll skip that. 

But...yeah...I totally get these all the time as well. Really haven’t found what triggers or stops mine. They just seem to come and go as they please. 

They used to really bug me. Now I just enjoy the music. :)

Good luck, OP! Keep us posted."

Edit: FWIW - I’m not sure what I believe regarding Marcus. As with most things, I suspect the truth is somewhere in the middle. 

Regardless, I appreciate finding new sources of information that shed additional light on what happened."
