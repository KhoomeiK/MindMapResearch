AskReddit,ff7jzg5,t3_ery2k3,1579651344.0,"It wasn't a frequent hideout, but my aunt used to own a house on an acre of wooded land. Part of that was a bunch of small trees/big shrubs, and for a few years in a row when we visited I would go to my ""house""- it was a place where the branches curved down to make a kind of room. I would collect sticks and rocks for furniture and utensils, make little parties, have adventures of hiking through the woods after a mystery or wild beast. 

Went back again a few years after I stopped playing in the woods and it was just a clump of leaves and sticks around a small clear spot. Amazing how imagination can make the simplest things into magical places."

gifs,fewdfrt,t3_eqjnc5,1579408753.0,"I used to think high snows like this were beautiful, always wished as a kid to get a real good snowfall. It meant snow days off school, sledding, hot cocoa and movies.

Now as a parent I'm just full of anxiety. What if the power goes out? What if we didn't get enough groceries? WHAT IF WE RUN OUT OF DIAPERS?!"

BeAmazed,fe63s40,t3_eno1c3,1578881140.0,"I have a 2mo right now and I totally get the other parents chiming in about safety and when baby starts rolling....but this is an heirloom, not something meant to be put through the abuse of a full infancy. (My son's crib would not survive the second baby)

When baby gets too big, it can hold stuffed animals. Put cute pillows and blankets in and let it be a lounger when mom or dad are in the room doing housework. It becomes a ship for adventures on high seas when baby starts to play and imagine."
AskReddit,fe2qd82,t1_fe2lzma,1578841699.0,"Take it with a grain of salt, its been years but basically : accidental scalding will show splash marks, be uneven, usually different degrees of burning because of uneven heat as the water hits the skin. Deliberate scalding usually has an even line where the water was poured or the child dunked into it, and usually is on the extremities."
AskReddit,fe2dyyb,t1_fe0ejiq,1578837278.0,I tried getting a degree in Social Work once and they do the same thing. First class involved how to tell if a child was scalded with boiling water on accident (like pulling the pot off the stove) or deliberately burned. Very quickly discovered I couldn't handle that.
AskReddit,fdk3h5l,t3_elju40,1578495142.0,You know I've been a little worried because we gave our daughter a hard-to-spell gaelic name but after scrolling through this I think she'll be fine
funny,fdh45sc,t1_fdgcucw,1578414990.0,"Happened to my husband! His mom had him when she was 15, years later got remarried and had twins with her husband when she was 43ish. So he's got a 28 year gap between him and his little brothers, and kids older than them too :)"
funny,fdh3tvj,t1_fdg0l0k,1578414786.0,"The best birth control for teenagers is to make them involved in caring for new siblings. Takes the bloom off the rose real fast when the baby won't stop crying and the toddler is yelling for a snack. 

My stepson is 14 and was 10 when my son was born, and got a little sister a few months ago. He's already saying he doesn't want any kids after seeing the stress it put my husband and I through. He's a great kid and a big help but he knows just how much work kids are!"
Unexpected,fdeuv5f,t1_fdeldfg,1578347085.0,"Its not just that she doesn't notice- she does, subconsciously. You see her getting quieter and more withdrawn as things escalate. Kids pick up on what is going on around them even if they don't understand what is happening. 

It kind of looks like she starts holding her stuffed animal tighter in her sleep too."
aww,fcl6rbv,t1_fcl136m,1577741019.0,"The pressure and confined feeling is very comforting to a lot of newborns who haven't adjusted to having lots of space around them. It also helps keep the startle reflex (where the baby jerks its arms out) from waking them up. Calmer happier babies sleep better, which means mom and dad do too! All kids are different though."
TwoXChromosomes,fcit2mg,t3_eh6r4a,1577669143.0,"I love my daughter and I am glad she is here. I'm glad that we have her in our lives. But god I wish I'd known about this in February. Having her has been very difficult and made things very precarious financially for our family. 

I am going to save this post and links though in case I find another woman in a similar position. What an incredible organization!"

aww,fbujn80,t3_eejegz,1577115537.0,"Just this weekend my son (4) burst into tears because I said he could go play while I made dinner, because he wanted to be my helper. I try and remind myself he won't want to do this forever and it's good for him to do things, instead of me doing it because it's quicker/easier."
