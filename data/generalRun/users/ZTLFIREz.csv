You just had a black president - and yet your stupid west was killing the people of my region by their millions anyway. The colours of you dont matter to me, you're all equally evil in the west. You just get to hide behind melanin while doing it now, like the WEST supremacists you are.

I was simply illustrating that I hold no biases but rather take an impartial out look that is purely factual while adding my own observations of the overall chain of events. 

Let me try to simplify it a bit because Ive never been very good at being brief but I'll try and see if I can at least clarify my stance some more. 

Depp has been a victim of a manipulative abuser from the very beginning. Even when there was no actual violence. He was at some point vulnerable, and she seized on that opportunity to sink her claws into him. He showed no wandering or anything prior to Amber, he was in a beautiful relationship with a wonderful woman, which makes me deduce that maybe the abuse is more than just violence but rather psychological from the get go. Planned and executed. That maybe this woman was feeding on his vulnerabilities and exploited him then turned to violence when she felt him pulling away to try and bring him back into line.

So I dont take a side in this, but I am rather an impartial observer. Though the conclusion favours him than it will ever her, so in a way I am taking a side; but I reach that conclusion thoughtfully rather than reactionally.

Johnny Depp was in a relationship with a wonderful woman that he will never know the like again. The mother of his only children, who was at his side through some really hard trials for any parent. She was by his side through no doubt ups and downs and his low points all the while encouraging him to hone his craft while maintaining hers and raising children.

They made it work, somehow they got through it all - together. They were beautiful together. I honestly thought the world of them and always said that out of all the couples in Hollywood, they seemed to have dodged the curse. Never in my life did I think anything could ever get in between them.

Then someone had. Someone or something that someone exploited for their own advantage. I am in no way shape or form saying that Johnny was completely overpowered or no longer in possession of his senses, but he was open and exposed somehow to manipulation.

He wandered. 

Whether it was with someone else or Amber Heard all along, doesn't matter to me. What matters to me is a family was divided. Two kids had to watch their parents separate. Yes he never married her, which to this day I am beyond confused about. But to a kid, your parents not being together is noticed. No matter how one tries to soften then blow, it's a blow. 

Why he wandered away from Vanessa the way he had, we will never know. She turned it all around, and she is now happily married to, who I pray, is a man who will adore her for the rest of her life.  But she gave Depp her best years and there is no recovering them. The way he talks to Amber even in those audio recordings, how he continues to declare how much he loves her - I cannot believe it. 

Amber is a vile, wretched human being, not even near as close to being on the same level as Vanessa, and yet he married her and still loved her even after all that?! I can't... I mean wow. He almost lost a finger to that maniac. She sliced him up and beat him up, and he married her and kept on loving her. 

ALL the while there was a real woman in his life that actually loved him. 

I can't take his side in this, but I am NEVER taking Amber Heard' side either.  

I have no right at all to think these things, it's not my life, but wow did he squander such a beautiful thing. Those audio recordings just disappointed me. He was being abused, and he still loved her and what really bothers me the most:

He never would have divorced her if she had stopped. 

That he was perfectly happy to stay with her had it not been for the abuse. She was NEVER good for him, nor good to him, and the way she manipulated him to my mind, is a form of abuse too. Not just beating but the way she had him wrapped around her finger. If she had been just a little more savvy and less impatient, she could have really done him significant damage -she was a fking gold digger with freeloaders for friends.

 It's a good thing he got those recordings and I really hope more comes out. 

If I have to take a side at all, I'll take the kids side and if they stand by him so do I - 1000%. I don't have to like what he did to the mother of his children, but he was a victim of a horrific human being.  I always hated Amber Heard, even when nothing was happening. She was a home wrecker, she had ZERO issue destroying a family. 

A sadistic, narcissistic psychopath. People can call them toxic all they want, the end of the matter is he is a victim of abuse. And if anyone has to take a stand at all, just take a stand on that. At least admit that he is the victim, and she was all along the perpetrator and abuser.

That's my two cents."

tolkienfans,fgjpqmf,t3_eyrjfn,1580848966.0,"I used to have actual fights with this one obnoxious girl during lunch break in school, who insisted that the horses of the Rohirum were all unicorns. She was obsessed with unicorns. Even though she never once picked up the books in her life....unicorns were everywhere. Then she would change her mind and insisted that just Shadowfax was a unicorn.  When the movie came out she insisted it was a unicorn on that screen, and  so I yelled during the slow motion shot of him 'THATS A FUCKING HORSE!'  And a guy in the front yelled back ' What did you think it was, a unicorn?!'"

Even the ears are perfect. The shadowing and the lighting - you have outdone yourself. The green of the leaves and the details in your strokes in everything around her as well. The depth of the environment, draws you in the longer you study it. It's perfect. At least to my eyes. 

You even managed to bring her eyes to life, there is someone behind those eyes. I almost wish this was part of a massive landscape. But I'd be very selfish."
Palestine,fgjm7yt,t1_fgjiro3,1580846922.0,"So what do you make of this issue?  Because from an outsider looking at this, this looks like the mere existence of Palestinians is an act of anti-Semitism now.  That this level of dehumanization can even be fathomed by grown adults at all, has my head spinning. That its an act of anti-Semitism to have a solidarity events with Palestinians?  Who are these bullies??? They act like thought police. 

This is just so grossly antithetical to Democracy and intolerable. If Jewish groups came out and showed solidarity with Palestine, will these orgs call them anti-Semitic too? Am I understanding how this works? 

Where is the balance in any of this?"

GeeksGamersCommunity,fgj2slz,t1_fgiwom4,1580835900.0,"I don't know about that....The orcs would still be around, so would the Easterlings and there were wars after Sauron was defeated. IN the event of Gondors king being killed by an Elf that would easily be a war on multiple fronts. Orcs going after elves and men, men going after elves and Orcs, the Easterlings serving the highest buyer if not attacking men and Elves to gain territories in the North. 

It would have been significantly bloodier. Maybe even wiping out all the elves. The Hobbits would have been invaded too as there would have been no King of Gondor keeping them safe."
