BipolarReddit,ffss8ng,t3_euupqb,1580190584.0,"I’m with you. I just saw my pdoc after a loooooong time of trying to go without meds, I almost ended up in the hospital again..No other choice. Maybe it won’t be so bad this time around"
BipolarReddit,ffss1y6,t3_eur8vx,1580190397.0,"Right there with ya, mixed episode myself, most fucking uncomfortable feelings, like an itch you can’t scratch no matter what the fuck you do!!!"
bipolar,ffsr4kr,t3_euw35b,1580189513.0,Hahahahahahah I was just thinking this. I like watching movies on my laptop so I can have my phone to research
bipolar,ffpast6,t3_eug8cg,1580090425.0,Oh my gosh I freaken knew it! I get mixed whenever I have a cup of coffee during depression. It skyrockets anxiety and gives me this crawling in my skin sensation and I get this “need to slit my skin or hurt myself” energy blasting through my weakened frame. Caffeine is effing DANGEROUS for those sensitive to it. It actually put me on a 5150 last year
bipolar,ffhn3t7,t3_etm6z5,1579943311.0,"Depression wasn’t as long as it used to be, it started getting shorter and shorter and I started physically feeling the switch to hypomania(way too happy and feeling light)"
bipolar2,ffgiqkf,t1_fffhjee,1579907162.0,Lmao what’s ya diagnosis?
bipolar,ffel3pp,t1_ffdczpw,1579852609.0,Same. I pressed books/papers into my cuts. Did it with a Bible too. Fuckin twisted but it did something
bipolar,ffdcia3,t3_esu92y,1579817971.0,What helps if you struggle with self harm is red marker/or paint. That way you trick your mind into feeling like you’re bleeding
Psychosis,ffbr2qx,t3_esj09h,1579779365.0,Ohhhhhhh yeah! The more odd things I find on my body the more convinced I am Something bad . Scares me a lot I can’t say it but I don’t dare go there. I know God is bigger
bipolar,ffa2yta,t3_es7s7t,1579726841.0,This is where it is really hard for me to tell if I am bipolar or not. Most nights I sleep 5/6 hours but still tired. Bed time is usually 4-6am but sometimes 12-2am. But sometimes I get this ITCH to be super duper productive! I’m tired but I don’t want to go to sleep because I need something produced or changed! I can’t tell if that’s quarter life crisis or bipolar lol
bipolar,ffa2oyx,t3_esgxil,1579726684.0,"Oh I’ve had the right journal! I love the ideas, each day is different creative spin! So cool!"
BipolarReddit,ff5r2w5,t3_eqj1da,1579606886.0,"Oh man I get this. I did the same thing as you. I got a sleep app that logs my activity. I wake up 4 or 5 times everyon morning but this sleep app is cool cause it records sound and i find its my damn housemates making racket, I don’t sleep till 3 or 4am and they wake around 7-8am. Sometimes it’s them and sometimes I just wake up. Usually about 7 hours I feel alright, sometimes I wake up on 4 ready to go but force myself back to sleep"
BipolarReddit,ff5qkeg,t3_eqzgiz,1579606221.0,"I never used to drink caffeine because it sent me straight into panic, but then I began to understand how my body reacts to stimulants and I am able to talk myself out of them. Now I freaken love caffeine most of the time. I get super connective with God/universe, my awareness opens up and I’m insanely sensitive to all my surroundings, I get the synchronicity and meanings like WILD. But that’s why I love it, makes work fun and conversations interesting, my time writing is full of wild thought but sucks because I get EASILY distracted ..BUT THEN THE DOWNSIDE is it triggers massive paranoia and anxiety."
BipolarReddit,ff5poc8,t3_erkyin,1579605016.0,"I was and then I hit a psychotic break and I was done. I did edibles for several months daily..Stopped for a few weeks, one night randomly went back on, ate a full 10mg and almost brought myself to the ER. Hearing radio stations and off key singing while seeing shapes in the hairs of your skin while you thought you were dieing was enough to wake me up and help me realize my brains done with drugs"
BipolarReddit,ff5pji7,t3_ernxer,1579604827.0,"Looking back I was hypomanic during childhood, I could never understand why I felt so different/sensitive  to my surroundings and faith than my siblings. I experienced severe depression around 15-20 and it remained the same ish until mid 20’s and the switch got turned on again(I guess dormant? If that makes any sense) and depression episodes got shorter and shorter and I felt like I could conquer the world and then stimulants started becoming addictive because I’d get high off coffee and get reckless and wild for several days and disappear depressed. I’d get all sorts of revelation from my faith and then disappear. Yeah...it took a while to recognize the cycles"
