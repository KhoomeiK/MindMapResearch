The doctor prescribed a bucket of Ambien and Valium. It worked! But my tolerance grew quickly. At the end I was taking 4 per night, not sleeping more than 4 hours, crazy anxiety and withdrawal symptoms 20 hours after my last dose, I attempted suicide more than once. A couple of psych ward admissions later I found a doctor to help me taper/replace with diazepam. I've been stable on 60mg of oxazapam per night for 5 years now, thank God. I know benzos aren't the best for long term but it's working for me. Ambien made me batshit crazy."

An epic semi-autobiographical tale of an escaped criminal who makes his way to India, and lives more adventures in the years he spends there than one normal person could in 12 lifetimes. I've read it at least 5 times, and I'll read it again.

Marching Powder. Another biography, of an English coke smuggler locked in a Bolivian jail. He almost died in a system that requires you to purchase your own cell and earn money while inside! He managed to survive, started giving tours, and the jail became a tourist attraction that was eventually so popular it was published in lonely planet.

The Sympathiser. This book really affected me. I've never been particularly interested in the Vietnam war, but this lively Pulitzer prize-winning account of the immediate aftermath sucked me in from the first page. It's not about the war, it's about the people, from the point of view of a double agent. It reminded me how brilliant and exciting a novel could be after a few years of not getting excited about many books.

I could go on but these are probably my top 3."
