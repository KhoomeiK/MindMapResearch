MakeupAddictionCanada,ffizcan,t1_ffiz0o6,1579986456.0,How come? Is it a medium finish?
uglyduckling,ffcaexr,t1_ffb87zq,1579795175.0,"That happened to me!! People thought I was crazy but when I attempted to work out, I got so sick to the stomach and just gave up for a bit. My ability to sweat did come back after a couple of months though. Hope
Yours does too. You are literally the only other person that I’ve heard has been affected by the “no sweat” symptom. Goodluck"
Marriage,ff3achy,t3_eqjb0r,1579537327.0,I personally couldn’t deal with that type of treatment. It’s the type of language that makes you feel guilty and shameful. It’s not sensitive or compassionate in any way. It’ll only get worse imo if nothing is done. I kmow this because I grew up with a father like this.

pregnant,fen6p1c,t3_epzjxn,1579278165.0,"Why waste precious energy on someone that won’t give you a second thought on a regular basis? You don’t owe her anything. Tell her you’re busy and will contact her if you have a free day and just don’t. Or take the other route and explain that you have grown from this friendship and will need to move on. What helps me is to remind myself that you don’t owe her anything if she’s toxic; bad life or not she’s not a good person to have around you, let her go. Goodluck!! Xox"

pregnant,fegzitb,t1_feggazw,1579105982.0,"I absolutely friggen love this response. It literally is “just don’t smoke”. What’s hard is the mind playing tricks. Also, the Allen Carr book took me for a whirl!! Two sentences that stuck with me - “when we sleep for 7-8 hours, our bodies don’t suddenly crave the nicotine... we still sleep through these “cravings” “ meaning we’ve been brainwashed to believe it’ll be impossible to quit. It’s not. And the second was “nicotine is a drug. Smoking and being addicted to it means you are a drug addict”   It’s literally mind over matter. I read the book and then got scared into stopping (family member got super ill due to smoking) and literally never “craved” a smoke. Smoked *heavily* for 8 years and all it took was a scare and my body literally didn’t go into any withdrawals. I truly truly believe it is mind over matter. OP. You’ve got this. Your baby doesn’t need that crap in their body (through the blood) ans neither do you."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fegcm3i,t1_fefhp1e,1579087759.0,"Very true. Did this job and you tend to see everything ans the calmer you are, the less the patient will freak out or something. The faster you register them, the faster the hospital can care for them."

todayilearned,fd3x21s,t1_fd3pt7f,1578162344.0,What is wrong with those women? Assuming instead of going up to talk to him? Morons. Great example for their children.
todayilearned,fd397dh,t1_fd2yzdt,1578155929.0,Yup
todayilearned,fd38tio,t1_fd34ug5,1578155785.0,Why do you think they avoid you? Genuinely curious. I’m a first time mom that is planning to go to playgroups and such and reading this is going to make me purposefully pay attention to the dad(s) in the group!
Mommit,fcwp0qg,t1_fcvfhr4,1578032166.0,"Fair. I don’t see it as managing though. I had to say it once to him and it has stayed. If I had to do it another time and whatnot, to me, it would be managing."
Mommit,fcvdwne,t1_fcv6f41,1578000064.0,"I loved this! Showed my husband and it clicked a little more.  But before that, keep in mind I’m very direct and don’t mind asking for what I need/want within reason, I told him “you need to do your share... you see something that needs to be done, do it. Im not a maid or your mother. We made this baby together, we need to do this together.”  It clicked with him. BUT! My husband is also the type that needs directness."
