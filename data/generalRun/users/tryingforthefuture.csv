Seriously, this happens every five-ten years and morons around the world flip their shit every time because they gobble up every word the fearmongering media tells them. See: bird flu, swine flu, zika, etc. Stop worrying, it's all scare tactics because when people are scared they buy more shit."

news,fc5kxv4,t1_fc5cxej,1577460370.0,"No one reasonable is arguing that we should allow children to buy and consume tobacco. The argument is that being an adult should mean being an adult. Why are 18 year olds mature enough to join the military and vote, but not mature enough to smoke or drink? There should not be levels to adulthood, it should be a definitive line. If the American people believe that line should be 21 then so be it, but we should not be arbitrarily deciding that some adults get certain privileges and some don't. Old enough to die for your country, old enough to have a beer or a smoke."
