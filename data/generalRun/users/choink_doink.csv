I'm so badass and tough because I subject myself to shocking images to seem better and cooler than other people. Btw I can't say the F word.
bluehairbitch,ffbnj8y,t3_ertgj4,1579774303.0,"A better message for this image could've been ""Both these women are beautiful and people can and will love you no matter your size"", but instead she basically tries to make herself seem better than the ""normal/expectation/sexy"" girl. Last I checked, feminism was being supportive of all women and the way they are, not bringing others down to make yourself seem better. I absolutely hate her artwork and how she depicts this blue haired bitch (who looks nothing like the artist) and the ""messages(?)"" she sends. You can't expect to look like the girl on the top with an hourglass figure and perfect skin when you refuse to shower or shave and only eat junk food because you think it makes you special or quirky. What's worse is that if you call her out on any of her stuff or even ask her wtf this is supposed to be, she just blocks you and keeps begging for patreon supporters for this nonsense."

jobcorps,feojswx,t3_eq2zux,1579301123.0,"Hi there. I have completed the CNA trade at my Job Corps in 2018. The thing about being a CNA is that we are the physical caretakers of usually elderly people. The work itself is 'easy' but is very backbreaking and residents can be noncompliant with their care and some of them are abusive. That's one thing a lot of CNAs don't expect. Generally your job consists of feeding, showering, toileting, and dressing your residents as well as cleaning their bottoms and changing incontience briefs. It's actually tough work, and in my state, you're not paid well for it. However, it is a very rewarding job and with some Job Corps and some nursing homes they offer you free schooling to get your LPN. My local center (Excelsior Springs Missouri) apparently now offers advanced training for LPN for our completed CNAs. Another nursing home job in town offered free LPN training at no cost but you would be in contract with them for two years as their own LPN. I would say that yes, CNA is great, but I wouldn't recommend staying as one and take advantage of honing in your skills and using it as a stepping stone to bigger things (such as LPN/RN/etc.) Hope this helps. Good luck!"

insanepeoplefacebook,femq69i,t3_epw2qz,1579266341.0,"I've never been raped. I've had my regrets after sex, sure. But in no way was it my partner's fault as we both fully consented during the act. Never has it crossed my mind to ever go after someone for rape just because I regretted it. I've fortunately been lucky enough to have partners understand when I did however not want to do it anymore in the middle of it, because sometimes you think you're in the mood for something and you're actually not. It's perfectly fine to retract your consent at any point, but not after once you feel regret. You're just as responsible as your partner. My biggest issue is that so many women like to decide that it was rape when it was consentual to get back at someone, and this creates a problem for actual victims of abuse/rape. Not only is it bad for actual victims to be taken seriously, those accused and proven innocent will still forever be plagued and judged by said accusation and their lives and careers will never be the same. My heart goes out to victims of sexual assault/abuse/rape, and I absolutely despise people who falsely accuse of rape."
