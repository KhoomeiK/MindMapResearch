3. Not for me. Yesterday I tried to search about this. Found stories about boys and girls in her situstion. All of them made me sick to my stomach. A 16 yo boy sleeping with a 27 married woman, how fucked up is that. Even if it is 'legal' in some places, that's sick of that woman.

Yeah, that guy is enjoying himself, which is garbage because he is taking advantage of a broken kid (at 18 you're a kid, she is in god damn high school and still lives with her parents).

She will be negatively impacted by this. It will be harder for her to search and find a healthy relationship.

About this, it may not be as relevant, but worth mentioning. 

The next day after the shooting in New Zealand at a mosquee I watched the video/live of the attacker. I never watched this kind of stuff before that moment (or afterwards) and I was 18 at the time. ""Decently Mature"". I saw people getting killed right in front of me, in a safe way, not right next to me; but  I was able to see it. It made me feel sick for weeks. This is the worst you can see, one person brutally and unwillingly die in front of you.

Did that change me as a person? No, it just reinforced some believes I already had, didn't make them stronger. But I do get random moments when I remember those sequences, which sucks.

Those were the times perfect for playing however you want and learn (if you want) and also do good and have fun.

Now that's impossible. If I play all pick trying to learn support I play horrible which results in not being able to do anything which results in a lost match with no fun. That makes me want to play supp less and not want to learn it.
