misophoniasupport,fel50ji,t3_epb24v,1579214195.0,This is the second time this week a post on Reddit makes me come to the conclusion that maybe I'm Mr. Krabs.
insanepeoplefacebook,fel1ycr,t3_epmaiv,1579212302.0,Maybe sarcasm comes with vaccines.
insanepeoplefacebook,fekz456,t1_fejhhxt,1579210607.0,I came here to say exactly the same. I see her picture thumbnail and I know I'll enjoy reading that answer.

AskReddit,fei9t9t,t1_fehv9b3,1579133496.0,The last lines of Wake is usually what gets me.
AskReddit,fei9fe1,t3_ep7tm4,1579133246.0,I could make a long list but one that comes to my mind tonight is The Foundry by Gravenhurst.
introvert,fef070k,t3_eortu0,1579045107.0,"I hate phone calls and avoid them as much as I can but it's more often due to personal dislike than anxiety (although I won't pretend the latter never happens). 

Most of the jobs I've always had have required me to call people or answer the phone (some more than others) so I'm used to it, but I like to just keep it functional. There are really rare instances where I deliberately choose to make a phone call rather than email someone because it's easier to get the message across quickly, but I really tend to keep it to a minimum.

Outside of work, I don't think you'd ever catch me calling a friend for a chat; only very close family members, and even then, I have a sort of quota for that."
introvert,fed5r18,t3_eoi3ze,1579000223.0,"I used to wear spike chokers for a bit many, many years ago and had one that had 2-inch spikes. It did the opposite effect and people loooved to come and try to touch it.

funny,fdvcb32,t1_fdv1s4f,1578745938.0,I've left an ATM without my money. Luckily I had kind people yelling at me as I was walking away...
misophonia,fduc777,t1_fdssfzu,1578731036.0,"I wrote my comment above with tongue in cheek as I'm not sure how serious these studies are, but I was thinking of something similar to the link OP responded with."
aww,fdsc884,t1_fdrkfo7,1578699285.0,I too have seen that and am forever traumatised. Weirdest thing is that the tortoise was on his own.

misophonia,fdrvo0y,t3_emkzsm,1578690399.0,"Hehe, I suppose ""noise is a torture to intellectual people."" falls in line with the studies about misophonia being linked to creativity and higher intelligence then ;)"
misophonia,fdruq76,t1_fdri13h,1578690079.0,I relate to this too.
lastfm,fdru4rt,t3_emsm2o,1578689722.0,"Embarrassingly, I miss days, especially at weekends or if I'm away on holiday, and even more so if I'm with others. I suppose instead I have a song in my head or sing out loud.

I guess it's a bit unusual compared to a lot of others, but most of my music listening happens when I'm at work or on public transport.

Edit: longest streak is only 27 days - that's in line with what I said then."
todayilearned,fdrreao,t1_fdrowdg,1578688573.0,"OK, I suppose I can see where you're coming from."
todayilearned,fdrnuq6,t1_fdrmj9l,1578687192.0,"I saw this link earlier in the same thread. As someone else pointed out in another comment after this was posted, it's just listing examples of when people have been using ""of"" incorrectly over time. 

Oxford dictionary definition of ""verb"" : a word used to describe an action, state, or occurrence, and forming the main part of the predicate of a sentence, such as hear, become, happen.

I can't see how ""of"" fits this. And you haven't answered the question about conjugation. 
I of? You of?... What is that supposed to mean? 
To me this is just justifying the use of a random word that people have started using out of ignorance."
todayilearned,fdrgq07,t1_fdrgip8,1578684276.0,Is that something you decided? It doesn't really answer my question.
AskReddit,fdrgkrt,t1_fdqtmzo,1578684189.0,"I feel the same way about the Bic Cristal Original, black."
todayilearned,fdrfqj4,t1_fdrbroj,1578683907.0,How do you conjugate the verb to of?
todayilearned,fdr9b87,t1_fdr0s28,1578681238.0,"I'm late to the thread. I have read this article before and I agree with the person you're replying to.

I understand the idea of descriptive grammar (and sometimes have to nudge myself as prescriptive grammar is so much ingrained in me culturally), except that in this case, it just doesn't mean anything. How can an auxilliary verb be replaced by a preposition and then supposedly mean the same thing?"
todayilearned,fdr892d,t1_fdqv5gc,1578680840.0,"I'd get that if ""could of"" actually had a meaning but it doesn't."
todayilearned,fdqe7yz,t1_fdqapyu,1578664357.0,"I know of someone who insists that both ""could have"" and ""could of"" are acceptable forms of the same thing."
