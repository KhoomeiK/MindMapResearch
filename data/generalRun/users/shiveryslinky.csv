My house is three bed (was 4 but we wanted a big bathroom and had the attic converted to third bedroom/office), massive rooms, two cellars, parking, decking and a patio with views over the hills and we bought it for £92k a couple of years ago. We've spent about £25k on it and it's probably worth about £130k max now but it's such a great house. It'd be worth about £270-300k if you moved it to even a more expensive part of Lancashire.

This was after a few dates when he was supposed to be picking me up to go out with his friends. Turns up on my doorstep and hit me with it.

You know, it's genuinely not about the amount of money you spend on kids, particularly not when they're toddling. The only thing they really hold onto is how they feel, and when they're loved and have their parents to play with it doesn't matter how many gifts are under the Christmas tree.
