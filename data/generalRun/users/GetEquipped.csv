My thoughts;

If all the information we received is factual: Its just a serious cold that is being kneejerked by the media to take away time from the Impeachment.  And yes, the several other contagious infections kill way more people a year and are a bigger threat.

However, I don't believe CDC screenings were in place at major airports for SARS/MERS and an entire province being on locked down and a city being enforced with threats of force. I know by the time it was discovered, it spread through parts of Central and Southeast Asia, but this seems excessive for just a serious cold like symptoms.

This is making me think the virus is far more serious and widespread than is being to reported. Even if it's causing something like viral pneumonia; I feel the response is excessive. Ultimately, we don't know what's going on at the epicenter due to the control of information the Chinese Govt has. They can say whatever they want, but unless we have other credible sources, thats all we can go on.

 There have been reports in Seattle and Chicago, and with Chinese New year, I'm sure we may see a larger international surge as people are commuting and airports are very, VERY, busy.

Either way, I was sincere in my praise to infection control. Being able to stop a pandemic at it's root.

In one support, he lays out ""decoy traps"" to drive Panne towards the actual one to propose to her. He convinces Maribelle to do ""labor"", and is supportive in his own way.

Cyril is just bland and almost all his supports are either what we already know (""You drink too much Manuela"" ""You're lazy Hilda"") or creaming his jeans about Rhea.

I would say Lysithea and Shamir are alright as we learn that he's illiterate and writes a thank you note for Lysithea and being very dorky, or Shamir where he desperately wishes to continue being her squire as he doesn't have many friends."

Man, I miss Donnel. 105% health growth meant he could (very low chance) get two HP on level up."
fireemblem,ffeyfa8,t1_ffey1us,1579870357.0,"I was thinking about taking him Warmaster for Quick Riposte, 

Playing a GD/Hard/Casual run ATM just to get classes mastered for some really weird lulz strats.  But this will be my third time trying to make him work, and if he doesn't, I'm intentionally going to kill him off in my future playthroughs.

And he has tough competition as Lorenz and Leonie are becoming the Chadicus and Bradicus of the group"
fireemblem,ffevixu,t1_ffev672,1579867336.0,"I've either had bad rolls on his level ups in the past, or he doesn't seem to do anything ""better"" than other units to justify a slot on the party.

He's no Donnel that's for sure.

That guy slew Gods and Kings with a copper pot on his head, a stick in his hand, and with Tharja holding his leash!"

Get back to work Cyril! The chamber pots need a good hand scrubbing!"
fireemblem,ffeonrl,t1_ffenqco,1579857667.0,"He doesn't call out Almyran culture. He just said his parents died in the war and he was just a kid and had to fend for himself.

Just like Ashe, Dorothea, Raphael, Mercedes, (Maybe Dimitri, but he was still royalty and more like traumatized and haunted by his father's burning dismembered body and not having to struggle to eat)

Cyril accepts that no one helped him because ""the King just didn't care."" This in turn has Claude realize the ripple effects of war (displacement, refugees, not enough food due to unusable land)"
fireemblem,ffentxg,t1_ffeixuh,1579856418.0,"Some of his supports are good- no that's too strong of a word. ""Tolerable.""

 He had one with Lysithea were she taught him out to read and logically addressed Hilda's prejudice by using her own logic against her. (In their C support she does the entire ""You're not like *them*"" sort of line.)

The ones with Claude are good if only for exploring Claude's Almyran heritage more.

Anyway, I was actually looking at the growths this morning and was going to make him a War Master as the stat growths seem better on paper (A lot more health.) and I have Claude for my Wyvern post time skip."

fireemblem,ffeftu9,t1_ffe6lw2,1579846377.0,"I did another Silver Snow playthrough recently. 

I skipped through most of it the first time because it was so similar to Golden Deer and because I found it dull; I stuck to my A-Team. 

But this time, I focused on just Church units (except Cyril, because he's terrible) and seeing how Seteth interacts with everyone, how he's stern yet wise, and how people approach him with so many problems but never feels burdened. Made me gain a lot of respect for him.

Despite that, he's still a meme to me."
