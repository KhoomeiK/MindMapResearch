Meditation,fgugaxp,t3_f0hvvr,1581120082.0,"Not all meditation is supposed to make you feel better in the moment. It is often simply regular practice at bringing your attention back to simple awareness, rather than following wandering thoughts. It's training a skill."
britishproblems,fgso4g1,t1_fgs69zf,1581088994.0,"I've always wondered what constitutes ""live TV"". For example what about a YouTube or Twitch livestream? I've always it assumed it has to be a ""TV channel"", however it is all defined very vaguely in the law."
britishproblems,fgs47pp,t1_fgs42ms,1581070751.0,"No license is needed to own a TV and to use it for DVDs, Netflix, video games etc.

A license is only required to watch or record  live TV broadcasts and/or to use the BBC iPlayer service."
running,fgq0ltm,t3_ezuye3,1581015598.0,"* Light strength based warm up / activation (5-10 mins)
* Do your run
* Yoga / mobility based cool down (15 mins)

Every single run if you can.

If you don't have time for everything, skip the run.

Myrtl routine is a good start for the strength warm up.  
For Yoga I recommend Abi Carver [yoga15.com](https://yoga15.com)."

GenderCriticalGuys,fghz1cr,t3_eyitvo,1580798515.0,I don't think it will change much from now.
UpliftingNews,fggmwa0,t1_fggbdbd,1580765179.0,"It's not bad per se, but nor do I see it as something to lift all our hearts, which is what this sub is for. It's just a thing that is, with a calculating political messaging aspect to it that makes it more ""news"" than ""uplifting news""."
videos,fgfzyfn,t1_fgfrhpe,1580751266.0,"Thanks for the wetherspoons tip, I wondered why I sat there for 4 hours wihtout being served! I shall revise my one star review.

Try going for an indian or Bella Pasta or something, it will blow your mind!"

Futurology,fgfos6f,t1_fgfn36l,1580744197.0,"True, culturally it is a mix and depends on the context."
Futurology,fgfmpdu,t1_fgflw9d,1580742787.0,"When you go into a British supermarket look at all the products. They are labelled in grams and litres.

I personally would estimate a distance in metres but you keep being you."
Futurology,fgfm7rz,t1_fgebdy9,1580742443.0,"I think their angle is to improve the environment, because that's what the people who vote for them want."
Futurology,fgfm0qf,t1_fgezhu9,1580742302.0,Wow what a devastating argument you have there.
Futurology,fgfl9j9,t1_fgf0cuf,1580741761.0,"I feel like ""Boris lies"" is a bit of an unhelpful meme. It's the go-to insult for those who oppose him. Not sure how true it is really, or indeed how useful it is in understanding him and the broader situation."
Futurology,fgfki5r,t1_fgf09p1,1580741201.0,Well they have delivered on one thing they promised at least.
Futurology,fgfjdqb,t1_fgeh1nc,1580740350.0,"It's commonly held myth that Boris is some kind of right wing caricature. He has been painted that way by his opponents, and those who lazily call him ""Britain's trump"", but the reality is quite different."
Futurology,fgfj58p,t1_fgezxtd,1580740169.0,"I wonder if the capacity exists to manufacture EVs at the rate needed to replace petrol and diesel sales in 5 years. That said we could just have few cars made for a while, wouldn't hurt. But a hard argument to make politically."
SquaredCircle,fgfhzal,t3_exvsou,1580739262.0,Surprised the lights were on. Usually it's dark during commercial and they blare ads at you on the screens.

UpliftingNews,fgff6q4,t1_fgfekdw,1580736953.0,"You speak the truth, we utterly depend on these products and on fossil fuel energy. Yet some call oil companies evil and unethical, and make a great show of condemning them, even while depending on the very product they make. People need to get real and accept their own complicity. The rich, the poor, everyone. Nobody is guiltless.

What nobody is willing to accept is that to save the world we are all going to have to make huge sacrifices. Everything else is empty noise."
UpliftingNews,fgfee1p,t1_fgfe1vk,1580736246.0,I would be willing to do that yes.
UpliftingNews,fgfdap3,t1_fgfaosn,1580735201.0,"It’s lefty because what they’ve actually achieved here is nothing, but it’s been hailed as progress. The left loves appearing to be better and more virtuous while actually being part of the same shitty system as everyone else. You’re right though environmental issues don’t really fit into left right."
UpliftingNews,fgfd3nr,t1_fgfc4qy,1580735010.0,You’re going to get downvoted to hell. The only acceptable post on the story is wow this is amazing.
UpliftingNews,fgfcwek,t1_fgfb9ug,1580734815.0,"I mean it’s the guardians choice what ads they accept. In the scheme of things it doesn’t affect anything. Certainly the idea that this is something to celebrate is weird.It’s the idea that this counts as uplifting that I object to. If this news story was Guardian newspaper runs its entire operation on solar panels, something actually to celebrate, that would be uplifting."
UpliftingNews,fgfbmsn,t1_fgfbbyh,1580733547.0,Terminating fossil fuel use is exactly what we do need to do. Yet none of us is willing to make the sacrifices to our lifestyles that would be needed. Instead we cheer on meaningless empty gestures and call it uplifting.
UpliftingNews,fgfaqs5,t1_fgf91c8,1580732623.0,Except that this achieves absolutely nothing. What is it a step towards?
UpliftingNews,fgfajdv,t3_ey5b8v,1580732398.0,Yeah and I’m sure none of the Guardian employees drve petrol cars or heat their house with gas or fly in planes.
samharris,fgbovk9,t1_fgb4xos,1580664496.0,Sure but condemn on their own merits and taken in proper context as a whole.
