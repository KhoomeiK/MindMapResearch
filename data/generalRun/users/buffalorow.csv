savedyouaclick,ffk063t,t1_ffibfuf,1580011798.0,This is why I absolutely hate 30 year mortgage and first time homebuyers being approved for 0% down. You can both be right and wrong. IMO it always comes down to living within your means of whatever your ideal lifestyle is.

savedyouaclick,ffjz4ca,t1_ffidfag,1580010945.0,If more people that work from home could tolerate the rural Midwest you get a lot of house for $150k even recent updates.

Not a history guy but southern states had started to secede after his election. Some things like the proclamation and other things just added fuel to the fire. But you can’t say that if he hadn’t less or more lives would have been lost if we let the slavery/ states rights issue play out over more presidencies.
