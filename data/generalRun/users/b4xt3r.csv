If you travel in particular parts of town where you encounter panhandlers on a regular basis keep a few index cards with names, phone numbers, and addresses of organizations close by where people can receive help they may need.  Trust me, if someone is trying to find help accurate, up to date information is far, far more valuable than a few dollars.  

If you are ever approached by a young woman who won't make eye contact ask if someone is making her do his against her will and tell her there are options for her - right now - if she is being forced into sexual service.

For the Super Bowl that year Budweiser had a set of commercials leading up the Super Bowl for The Bud Bowl where [bottles formed teams](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2014-01/campaign_images/webdr03/29/10/the-definitive-bud-bowl-rankings-1-8789-1391010503-5_big.jpg) for Bud and Bud Light.

The bar I worked at was running a promotion and had life-size cutouts of the Bud Bowl Bottle Player, essentially 6' tall oddly shaped bottle player and I took one home, Bud Light, if memory serves.

It wasn't long before my roommate and I started to do horrible things to one-another with that damn bottle (that sounds awful).  In our rooms, if lying in bed, your feet would be towards a window so we began to sneak into one another's room and we'd place the bud bowl bottle at the foot of the bed.  Let me tell you it is absolutely terrifying to wake up from a dead sleep and catch sight of a burly silhouette standing at the foot of the bed backlit by the window.  

The fun stopped one night when I didn't know he had one of his lady friends in bed with him and she woke up at some point that night, caught sight of Bud Bowl Man and freaked the f out.  Screaming, crying, crying-screaming.  Police were called by neighbors, it was a mess.  I took Bud Man to the dumpster that night, tore him up, and threw him away."

Oh, advice.  You're probably going to get a bit of jitters or something, I mean, this is a big moment, so that's normal.  Don't get so wrapped up in what you think the other person might be thinking because whatever you think they are thinking doesn't matter because there's a 99% chance you are wrong (and that's true whenever you think you know what someone else is thinking - if you want to know you have to ask).

The base is large enough that it supports multiple sub-vendors.  The subs themselves are listed in the job posting so gather a list of jobs that look most interesting to you and then contact that subcontractor.  Have your resume ready.  Tell them that you ware looking for IT work and you can be honest about the why you want to get out of your current line of work but make sure you stress on your resueme, in the heading, right at the top, that you are prior service.  If you are flexible on what you want to do, and really you are looking to get your foot in the door I would think, I can't imagine it would take much past a week to have a job offer in your hands.  Ask the company about training too.  You can say ""this job looks interesting but I'd really like to get into X and that requires training I do not have.  Are there training befits with your company?""  Something along lines.  They love to hear that stuff, and they really love it when someone actually wants to do that (train for a specialized role).

Honestly if you have a shot or any interest at all in working back on base that's an excellent in - and one you earned through your service.  It's a benefit you earned, why not use it?  All that needs to be done is a pick a base and figure out which company is doing the staffing for those jobs (not difficult, and I can help with that) and apply directly to that company.

depression,fdsqt48,t1_fdqnhe3,1578706746.0,"Good, I am glad you are doing better.  I understand what you mean by the anger inside you because I have the same thing.  I'm not sure where it comes from or how I picked it up along the way but I did and it's there so it just needs to be kept in check.  Your plan is also very good, I think: exercise, meditation plus work and school.   There is something to be said about keeping busy.  Exercise is a problem for me.  Three years (or so) ago I broke my back, crushed my T-12 so a lot of the exercises I enjoyed a little bit I can no loner do for any extended period of time.  I'll just have to find some new ones.

As for my meds  - no problem.  I take 150 mg Wellbutrin SR.  It started with 75 mg twice daily but the 150 SR seems to work best.  There are at leas three different types of depression meds, where Ketamine is new kid on the block after 50 years of SSRI inhibitors, whatever class of product Wellbutrin is in and now Ketamine.  

When you do start your meds, if you go that route, tell the people around you that you trust the most that you are starting meds and to watch for any significant differences.  My ex-wife worked for a big pharma company when we were married and she was in the department that processed reports of adverse events and a lot of the really bad reactions were extremely uncommon and even more weren't real at all - but they had to be reported to the FDA because they could not be disproven.  Case in point: someone get pulled over for a DWI and blows a 2.0 on the richter scale.  He has his lawyer call Pharma Company X to inform them that his client ""was taking their medication when after only one beer the amount of alcohol in his system multiplied which had to be caused by your product"".   That is an almost verbatim quote from one of the lawyers.. so when you hear ""don't operate heavy machinery when using Drunkanator XL"" it may be a real side effect or it may not.  Just don't make yourself too crazy on the list of a bizzillion side effects because they are all *possible* side effects and some really aren't even that."

What I have told everyone that I've talked to about this is ""if you find something that works for you then by all means, stick with it"".

Mine is a complicated scenario.  As I have mentioned my depression was unrelenting and ever increasing for a couple of decades.  Near the end, which I thought was going to be my literal end, I took up a couple substances that help stave off the immediate need to exit the show - they had given me the power to maintain while trying to come up with a plan on how I was going to make everything look like an accident.

Long story short I got roped into going into cognitive behavioral therapy  meetings with a friend (he had no idea how bad off I really was and he was just trying to help, I owe him for that).  When I started to attend the CBT meetings I started to ask the WHY questions. Why do I know I'm worthless?  Why do I know I'm a failure?  Why do I know all I am capable of doing is consuming resources someone else would make better use of?  And that's when I started to figure out I was very, very depressed in the clinical sense.  From there I got a therapist who put me on some meds and it's been a literal night and day difference for me.  I've come to realize that in my case, which doesn't apply to everyone, I'm either not wired like other people or my normal state of equilibrium is just all f'ed up and needs a nudge in the right direction.

I will say this - if you do decide to try meds do so only under a doctor's supervision and let people you trust know that you are trying them out.  I got BEYOND lucky when the first one they tried on me worked.  It's not that way for most people.  Just be mindful.  For me I didn't notice much of a difference at first but the two people I told at work here like ""holy sh*t, look at you!  Bright eyes, smile, looking UP instead at at the floor"" and if was then I realized I really did feel much better.  I don't know if this is what normal people feel like by default but its a whole lot better than it was so I'll take it.

I wondered about the religious aspect of it all too.  If there was a God I wondered what had I done to so offend Him that I deserve to be kept alive if only to suffer.  Ok, Job from the Old Testament I was not but how I wished to be Uzzah - obliterated by God on the spot all for touching the Ark in an effort to keep it from rolling off an ox cart.

I bought one of those yellow pages for the web (I am guess this would have been summer of '93 or spring '94) and I found, at some university, a picture of a sandbox and you could click on the picture and that would move a device to the corresponding X/Y coordinates over the sandbox  were it would blow out a small burst of air and in doing so expose things buried in the sand.
