Eventually the cat will learn that you being around is worth putting up with you just to get Thur treat.  Attitude = no treat.   Acceptance = treat.  hopefully

ThailandTourism,fdpdocn,t1_fdnq7t9,1578625988.0,Doesn’t matter.  It’s the utter convenience of having your own private driver for the day.  Believe me when you hop-back in to the aircon after traipsing Around a temple in the heat it will be worth every cent.

WeAreTheMusicMakers,fdmbryx,t3_em2bsa,1578544948.0,It sounds like a delay or reverb artifact. You sure that’s the raw track?  If so then Try a noise gate. Go lightly though.  It’s tricky. Failing all that just re-record the track.
WeAreTheMusicMakers,fdluvxd,t3_em2bsa,1578533053.0,Maybe running from the same bus is the problem.  Try running two separate busses.

ThailandTourism,fdlrjuk,t3_em1jti,1578530798.0,"KRABI.  Ok just make sure your travel insurance covers these activities.  Sounds like you are doing pretty low danger activities so you should be ok there.  Be aware however that if you do run into some medical problems and you aren’t covered because you decided to hire some sketchy local to drag you behind a power boat with a parachute, well,  need I say more? Oh coconut meat is everywhere.  Even at the airport.  Don’t worry."
ThailandTourism,fdlqvho,t3_em1jti,1578530335.0,CHAING MAI.  You can find a five person van driver who will give you a good rate if you hire  him for the day.  He will take you around to these places and wait for you while you are there enjoying the attraction.  Easy day for him as he spends most of the time in the shade with a cool drink.
ThailandTourism,fdlqf1h,t3_em1jti,1578530021.0,"BANGKOK.   Just remember there are three seasons in Thailand in the year.  Hot, bloody hot and hot and wet.  That’s it.   it’s gonna be hot and it drains your ability to see more than one or two major attractions in one day.  Take it easy.  Take your time.  Don’t rush. You will miss things like the ambience and the pace of life.  The BTS system is great.  I wish it was around 30 years ago when I visited often.  You buy your ticket from ticket machine or go to the window and a human will help you.  Most speak English."

Bass,fcmr1bh,t3_ei0zad,1577787972.0,100 watts is not gonna cut  it for bass.   Buy a separate 400 watt head.
