I saw the same media blitz following 9/11 and made one of the the biggest mistakes of my life and saw many other young people get hurt and worse. This in not about America, its about rich old men who can throw away the lives of the poor for profit with no consequences.
War is not fun. Its very hard work with no pay of fand lots of injustice. Hold on to your souls."
