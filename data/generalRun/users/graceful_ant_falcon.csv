The heroes differ depending on whether you’re going off the movies, the comics, etc. As far as movies go, there are fewer bad Marvel movies than DC, but there are more DC movies that stand out in a positive way than Marvel."
heatedarguments,fef320g,t3_emq60v,1579047010.0,"Depends. In America, the average donut is a mass of dough covered in sugar and icing that just tastes sweet and leaves a sticky residue on your fingers. There are some good donuts, but they’re normally much more expensive and not practical for everyday donut eating endeavors. On the other hand, the donuts I’ve eaten in Europe are absolutely delicious and one of my favorite desserts. They’re complex, have other flavors besides sweet, and aren’t usually expensive (unless you go to a very tourist-y area). 

So yes, donuts are overrated if they’re the ones you get from a convenience store, but if they’re more innovative with cool flavors, I think they’re pretty good."
Anxiety,fdoxpmh,t3_emckin,1578615268.0,"I get this pretty much every week. My classes are very difficult and I end up spending my whole day at school, doing homework, and then studying for tests. I finish around 8 or 9 pm and just go to sleep after that. I do that everyday and then on the weekends I lay in bed doing nothing because i don’t have the energy to get up. 

This was actually last semester and my classes are easier now, so I can’t change anything even if I wanted to."
psat,fdjavvv,t1_fdj23q2,1578463656.0,Khan Academy and College Board have a lot of really good studying options that are free. There’s some other good ones like Princeton Review but those cost money which isn’t always an option. You can study by doing practice tests and practice questions on the aforementioned sites. Doing well in your core classes such as English and math will help because you’ll be studying and learning at the same time.
depression,fdip4a0,t3_elhhgz,1578447882.0,"I feel the same way. A lot of the time I feel like I’m not good enough and I don’t deserve my friends. I end up distancing myself from everyone and everything but then I get lonely. I was talking to someone for a few months and that was one of the times that I was consistently getting better, but we stopped talking and I went back to this push and pull between wanting to see my friends and thinking that I shouldn’t because I’m not good enough for them."

This semester I’ll be taking a dance class at school, which is something I’m very passionate about so I hope that it can be a time where I can just let go and be myself without anything to worry about."

BALLET,fcxwsdv,t3_ejhp54,1578071628.0,"To ballet I always wear a Balanchine bun as per protocol, but for dance it varies. I have really long hair so I can’t really leave it loose, even though I’d like to for modern, but it gets in the way too much. I normally stick to a ponytail and I use a really thick ponytail holder to make sure it stays. If not a ponytail I’ll wear a low bun. Sometimes I’ll wear a Dutch/French braid but that takes more time to do and I’m lazy. 

Dancing in a ponytail may take some time to get used to it you have really long and/or really thick hair. It’s heavy and you might step on it or it can get caught under your back. It’s just something you have to practice dancing with and get used to needing to flick your head a certain way to get your hair out of the way. If you have long hair, I wouldn’t dance with a high ponytail unless it’s for a performance because it can get in your face really easily and it takes effort flick it aside."
BALLET,fcwjicv,t3_ej64yq,1578027318.0,"Out of personal experience, make sure that the shoe isn’t too wide. Keep in mind that the shank will get softer as you wear them and more of your weight will be on your toes as time goes on. I’d always ask to try a tighter option if you feel to much weight on your toes. If it’s too tight, great! Now you know and can be sure that the ones you tried originally fir properly. Although, make sure not to get it so tight that it hurts. Some discomfort is probably going to happen, but there shouldn’t be any sharp pain right of the bat. Pain is an indicator that you need a different pair of point shoes (different brand or size that fits your foot better) or your shoes are dead. 

If you’re only doing half an hour a week at first, which is normal for beginners, your shoes should last a while. However, this also means that they will wear out slowly and won’t realize when it’s time to get new ones. Make sure to check in with a teacher after a few months to make sure your shoes are good or if you need new ones. 

Don’t fall for fancy ribbons or toe pads. Unless you have a specific reason for this not to be a case, any type of ribbon should work for you. This is a good thing to keep in mind as pointe shoes are expensive. If you end up spending more because you really liked the way Russian pointes feel, you can save a little more on ribbons or toe pads. The thing with toe pads is that if you aren’t in discomfort without a product, you don’t necessarily need it. Keep in mind you can always come back and get more toe pads if you need them. 

Some of these were kind of specific, but I hope it helps. Good luck with your journey en pointe!"
unpopularopinion,fctbj1x,t1_fct9zy8,1577938152.0,"Just to point out, I basically co-parent my younger sister with my mom, so I have a small amount of experience. It’s nowhere near being an actual parent, but I have experience particularly in getting my sister to eat since my mom isn’t home for dinner on weekdays. (You had no way of knowing that, so no hate). I deal with the struggles of getting her to eat various things, or to even eat at all. I know that kids won’t always eat adult meals and that’s fine. I specifically said that if you get a kids meal, at least have them try an adult meal so they get the experience. Also, it’s just my opinion and you’re welcome to have yours, and I respect that as long as you aren’t invalidating mine."

unpopularopinion,fctavzy,t1_fct9qqj,1577937617.0,That’s awesome. In my opinion that’s what the kids menu should be like.
unpopularopinion,fctat3u,t1_fctal0l,1577937554.0,"I’m not endorsing wastefulness. If you can’t finish the meal, take it home and eat it another time."
pointe,fcjd7fv,t3_eh8g71,1577683591.0,"Yes, you should definitely get new shoes. Your left shoe looks pretty dead, which means your left foot is probably stronger than your right. This is common, but just means it takes more effort to break your right shoe in."
