HaircareScience,fg0j37q,t3_ew95nv,1580408819.0,"I guarantee you not everyone is making fun of you. Your hair looks average. Bad hair = bald spots, breakage, weird faded colors, weird cuts. When I see people with hair issues, I’m never thinking about how much they suck. I simply see it, and continue with my day. 

I have had all those problems at some point. That is the beauty of hair, we can do so many things to it. 

Your hair is just really dry. This can be a bigger issue for those with grey hairs, because those hairs are natural more dry/course.

Find a hair oil you like, and see if using a little every day works. If it doesn’t, look into hair moisturizing treatments. Consider getting a a more moisture heavy conditioner.

You should also check if your shampoo may be too stripping. 

If you want better advice/more guidance, get yourself a haircut & style appointment. Ask your hair expert what you could do to make it look more alive. (They can try products on you that you never knew would create results)

Learn more about hair in general! This is a fixable issue. Try not to let your frustration get in the way. Our relationship with hair can be so important to our self esteem. You may see what’s wrong, but no one else is really noticing your hair as bad. And if that’s a problem for them, they’re not even the kind of person you would want to like you, right? 

Don’t let these ghosts of doubt freak you out too much. A lot of ladies have hair issues, they’re absolutely on your side because they understand."

Ask yourself questions like: does this hair look glued to the forehead? Is skin blended more than hair? What parts of the hair catch light vs shadow? Does this part of the skin cover a bone, or muscle?

I think most of texture practice begins with understanding the differences between everything in the drawing.

I’d say to change your normal hairstyle, including where you part it. The most exposed/pulled hair tends to form bald spots.

I think what helped was to just try to treat my hair with moisture/protein. Protein 1-2 times per week, and moisturizer as needed to make sure your hair doesnt break from getting too brittle. 

As long as you have a healthy diet, you won’t need supplements. If your diet is bad, try some of those.

Have you started using weird products that don’t help? Reconsider if they help or harm.

Do things that relax you more often, and be consistent with whatever methods you try. (Follow directions for products)

And don’t try too many things at once! You’ll never figure out what helped.

Oh, and if you’re styling/heating your hair, consider spreading that out farther. Give the hair some down time to recover.

Things like telling your partner you get antsy at things helps them navigate the relationship.

Funny story, my husband came home with a pink stain along the bottom of his mustache. My brain said this was it, the day I caught him cheating. My mind kept turning and turning and I just blurted out, “what shade of lipstick does your wife at work wear? I want to buy the same shade so she doesn’t find out about us.” 

He is used to my accusations which start with jokes, and end up with me as an emotional wreck. But we stopped the train before hitting a meltdown.

He is clueless, says, “you know I don’t cheat,” starts rubbing his stache and laughing.

I’m not convinced, and he’s not convinced I’m okay about it. So we talk through it.

Eventually we end up talking about the bubbly fruit water we drink that permanently stained our bed a pink red color after a spill. That stuff ended up dying his blonde mustache hairs because he let the hairs get too long. It dyes my lips for longer than a day, so it made sense.

If I hadn’t said anything, I think I would have sunk lower and lower, and done something like follow him to work the next day.

He knows I have issues with feeling like my partner is abandoning me, because I try to tell him about those moments. If he didn’t know, he wouldn’t have been as concerned about reassuring me. 

He has his own issues, like having a panic attack because he can’t find something. So I balance things out by helping when he’s headed towards a bad place.

CPTSD,feaz4up,t3_eo85ci,1578953756.0,"I write poems, memories that pop up, analysis of the different traits I have, drawings, the same sentence repeated, lots of profanity and ragey rants, words of intention, my philosophy on life, stream of consciousness, just anything.

I date everything so that when I go back, I can know which emotional period I’m in when I wrote it.

I usually use my journal when I feel like the words I want to say want to be screamed. I use it to cool down from intense situations/feelings of hurt. I use it to shit talk about people no one else wants to shit talk about(abusers they still support over me). I use it to see if my brain is becoming more optimistic/if medications are bad.

I also write about my health issues and jokes I made up.

The most important part of journaling, is finding a book you are drawn to and will keep dear. For me it’s a simple, lined little black book, for my sister I’d be something poppy and fashionable and geared towards organization.

I’d say a good prompt is any question you want answered. Ex: why does the neighbor spend so much time in their garden even though people keep walking on it? What is my favorite food and why? Why was bobert mad when I said his shoes looked blue? Why do I cry every day? Why is life so hard? What kind of super hero would I be? Would people like me if I was homeless? 

You think all day already, so just track these questions and write an answer you believe or don’t believe."

They thought I was doing all the dishes in the sink(it was empty). So even they misinterpreted what was going on at first.

My point is, either you, them, or both can misinterpret these moments. And I’d say to just keep monitoring yourself in a way you can look back, and check on your past thoughts you’ve written to make sure things still make sense."
bipolar,feaefil,t3_eo61pg,1578947664.0,"I went my whole life without disability, it didn’t make my situation better or lead to anything positive. 

I am currently a person who crashed after a year of grad school. Since June I haven’t had a job. I leave my house once a week. I live because my husband spends all his paycheck on my healthcare. My personal savings drops by $200 every month anyways(medicine, therapists who deal with trauma are out of network, I drive an hour in a shitty car to get there, etc).

I was teaching college students how to code August to May 2019. I qualify for disability now. It’s not that I’m incapable, it’s that I’m incapable right now. 

Take any help you can get, I am about to join you in disability assistance. I am tired of suffering because I do not believe I deserve help. You have been labeled as a person society is mandated to help get through this harsh life. See the benefits for what they are.

It’s not as if you will waste it. The goal of the money is to get you a better quality of life. Education is a big entry point, and so is acknowledging your educational journey will be “non traditional”."

I don’t want you to worry more than you have to.”

They need to know you’re okay, that’s why they get sad. They don’t know if they should celebrate with you or call your therapist.

I am not happy, and I no longer expect to have deep friendships with anyone. 

I have chosen to disconnect myself further, and the bad part is that I feel I can finally be myself. And yet, I pack it away any time I see a person. 

I am full of distrust, but I prefer it to the longing that comes with wanting to join society. Never worked out for me, so now I find it unnecessary for myself.

Essentially it will swell, then it will deflate and harden. Once I see pus at the top, I may pop it since I am a face picker. Then I just keep applying neosporin after washing with soap. 

I don’t know if this method will give you any results, but I don’t think it can cause harm. I don’t recommend you pop it though, that’s just my personal bad habit."

It’s like being able to walk from one room, down a hall, and into another in my mind.

Most of my memories are highly emotionally charged. I remember how people look so well, that I passively tell myself, “he walks like x” or “she tilts her head like y.” 

I close my eyes sometimes, and I see something I really don’t want to see. If I stand somewhere I start remembering everything that happened while I stood there. 

I find it funny that I can never remember a name. I have to play all the games to remember what I actually need to.

bipolar,fdevtax,t3_el0kr9,1578347647.0,"Do you not want to be bipolar, or do you not want the medicine to be wrong? I think it has more to do with the first part, as receiving a label is always going to do some damage to your mentality. 

Say you stop taking the medicine, and two years from now you have a manic episode, will you have regrets? 

If a pill could help you to feel more okay with life, would it be worth taking? 

Did you ever think you were sick with a cold, but it was actually a flu and you should have gone to the doctor?

You have a lot to think about, and it’s okay to think exactly what you do. I have been there.

They thought I was addicted to meth my first hospitalization and made me promise to stop abusing drugs before they would let me leave. I don’t do meth, what they found in my system was the result of being drugged by someone while I was manic(I completely black out at these times but remember small things over time.)

They thought I was schizophrenic because I was hallucinating. I was hallucinating because I didn’t know where I was and I kept getting tranquilizers and I was half dreaming, and because I was mad. 

Then they thought it was depression. Lol I learned to deal with depression as a child, that’s a terrible theory. 

What do I have? Now they say bipolar. 

I 100% have cPTSD, and I can no longer manage it. But I don’t care about my label anymore, they’re always going to be some form of wrong. Luckily medication is about trying things. And usually those pills can treat overlapping illnesses. 

What matters is being heard. When I say I’m done trying this pill, I need to see an immediate change from my doctor. I will complain about all my symptoms every week until one day, I will have nothing to complain about.

I will stop taking pills once I have tried them all. I couldn’t continue a life without medication, because I was always self medicating, and either over or under-prescribing. I no longer what to shoulder all responsibility. I will give some to the pills. I want my doctors to help save me."
