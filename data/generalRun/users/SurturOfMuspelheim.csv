A large amount of food that stores throw away is perfectly fine, it just doesn't sell because it doesn't look good.  We all do it, we go to the store and NEVER buy that apple with that mark, but it's perfectly fine to eat.  Tons of food is still good once it's past the best buy date, btw.

For example in France all food that doesn't sell should be donated instead of wasted.

You can't compete with free products.  I know this is more of a Capitalist take on the issue, but you get the point.
