sustainability,fe5mk3w,t3_enqcoj,1578871428.0,"I feel like steps one and two are misguided.

Step One seems to infer this problem is not related to consumption, but rather the supply side. While I agree that governments are certainly in the best position to make significant change, we can't expect companies to benevolently change their ways - that's not how corporations work. Corporations work by fulfilling the demands of the consumer to maximise profit and return on investment. Change the demands of the consumer and the priorities of the companies will follow.

Step Two I take issue with the example. Stopping a gas plant will do very little to stop consumption, and therefore demand for gas, other than perhaps a slight increase in prices. It means gas will need to be transported further through pipelines, ships, trucks and trains. Lovely to think each person who signed a petition can go away knowing they earned 54 years of carbon credits, but they've probably done more harm than good.

The spirit of the step is good though: Change the system for maximised impact. If you fight for stricter regulations on home insulation, for example, or heating product efficiency, you can reduce demand for gas and reduce the need for production and the associated plants, pipelines and emissions.

The biggest change we can fight for is a tax on emissions. Make people pay a fair share of the cost of polluting the planet. All of a sudden, there is an economic incentive to change the whole system. Minimising emissions becomes a priority from production to consumption. Tax revenue can be used to subsidise renewable tech and low income households. The impact will be short lived as critical mass kicks in on localised energy grids, electric vehicles, hydrogen energy cells, home insulation products, tidal desalination plants,"

By changing our consumption habits and introducing incentives to divest from coal we are both cleaning up our own act *and* improving the emissions produced overseas. 

Per capita is significant because it presents a pattern of behaviour conducted by western nation citizens which are quickly being emulated by the developing nations. If we can find solutions within our own sphere of control, those solutions will be available to countries who don't have the luxury of significant disposable income and consumer populations."
