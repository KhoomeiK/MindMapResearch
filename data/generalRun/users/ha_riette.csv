I’m trying not to take it personally, it’s just the fact that she is confiding in and talking to all her other friends except me, and we are extremely close. I haven’t asked her questions etc, just let her know I’m here for her, but I’ve tried to space out the times I text as I don’t want her to feel smothered. I guess I just need to wait it out and be patient, but it’s hard not to rack my brain for something I did wrong."
