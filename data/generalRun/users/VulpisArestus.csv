AdventuresOfGalder,feyq288,t3_eql50q,1579449118.0,"Looks cool, but I think you've stacked too many benefits.

2nd level spell, 1d10 of guaranteed value, either if life gain or damage reduction. Early game means *usually* preventing most or all of the damage. Even late game, potentially adding an average of 5AC, or preventing a portion of damage is a pretty good use of a slot. 

8/10
Good flavor, clear intent, too strong in my personal opinion. I'd remove the damage reduction on the second half, and instead heal the d10 when it misses, instead of hits. This way the upside is enemy fails action, and the downside is still a nice perk of damage reduction.

""What do you do with the mad that you feel

When you feel so mad you could bite?

When the whole wide world seems oh, so wrong...

And nothing you do seems very right?

What do you do? Do you punch a bag?

Do you pound some clay or some dough?

Do you round up friends for a game of tag?

Or see how fast you go?

It's great to be able to stop

When you've planned a thing that's wrong,

And be able to do something else instead

And think this song:

I can stop when I want to

Can stop when I wish

I can stop, stop, stop any time.

And what a good feeling to feel like this

And know that the feeling is really mine.

Know that there's something deep inside

That helps us become what we can.

For a girl can be someday a woman

And a boy can be someday a man.""
