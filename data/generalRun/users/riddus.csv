The dosing can vary wildly by person. I know very casual users who might take 5-10 mg, and seasoned enthusiasts who take 100+

It just seems to me some intelligent control measures would be far more efficient that large scale attempts to suppress a force of nature. We probably could have dug a moat around several major cities for what the fire fighting efforts the past few years has cost."

interestingasfuck,ff9ipfm,t1_ff84sbp,1579713856.0,"It turns out that if you leave brush and forest alone, completely and totally don’t fuck with it, it will burn naturally. 

Our efforts at fighting every little fire that sprouts up prevents the natural order of things. Brush and deadfall on forest floors accumulate because it doesn’t burn off in these minor wild fires that we should be letting burn, so when “the big one” comes there’s just that much more fuel. 

As some other comments mention, there used to be a practice of clearing out dead growth either physically or with controlled burns. I believe getting away from that (among the obvious climate factors) have contributed to the intensity of wildfires. Mind you, I’m not expert, just a guy who probably reads too much."

WatchPeopleDieInside,ff67x46,t1_ff61ixw,1579621249.0,"I’m not sure why you’re being downvoted, this seems like a genuine question. 

American kids can legally start learning to drive at 14-15 years old with a Learner’s Permit. If you take classes recognized by your state and community (and pass) you can get your license just before you turn 16, otherwise you must wait until 16. Even after earning your license at that age there a restrictions on who you can have as passengers without an adult present- this keeps new drivers from acting foolish with a group of teen friends. 

Parents will teach their kids for a number of reasons. It’s seen as a right of passage into adulthood and the parents want to be involved, or maybe they can’t afford the classes. In my case, I learned to operate a vehicle at a very young age because our family business required lots of moving vehicles around."
