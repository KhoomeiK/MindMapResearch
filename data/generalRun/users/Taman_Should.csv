architecture,ffk2mvf,t1_ffk22nr,1580013907.0,"Of course it doesn't snow much in Portland, the elevation is too low and it's too close to the ocean. Wind does not always behave exactly as you state though, sometimes it flows all the way from the deep canyonlike part of the gorge past Portland and Vancouver continuously. The ""gorge effect"" is not limited to where the gorge is deepest. That's all I'm saying. You seem to be confusing that with saying that it's deep all the way along it."
architecture,ffk1lrn,t1_ffjzj5o,1580013026.0,"After this, we're done. Fist of all, why focus only on snowfall? Portland gets ice and freezing rain all the time. That's from cold air flowing along the river. ""The Gorge"" is often talked about as existing somewhere near Hood River, but there's no clear start or endpoint. The hills on either side of the Columbia just get lower and lower before eventually disappearing to the north near the outskirts of Vancouver. It doesn't just stop at some arbitrary point, it's a narrow canyon that gets shallower and shallower as you get closer to the ocean, and wind follows the river all the way. Wilsonville, as I said before, is close enough that the influence from cold air-masses that come down or up the gorge can be felt there.

Like a lot of his houses, it's a good example of Wright's all-encompassing vision. Every detail had to be worked out and specified, including all the furniture. 

One thing I found interesting was the kitchen. There are no windows, only skylights, and the walls are all the same painted concrete block. All the appliances are original and were apparently some of the most advanced (for the time). Since the client's wife liked to cook, that's what Wright ordered. The opening to get into the kitchen is extremely narrow, only 24 inches wide. Other parts of the house are also proportionally weird by today's standards. 

There is no dining room, because the owners (the Gordons) said they liked eating in front of the TV. The living room feels almost like a chapel, except for the built-in shelving and sitting nook at the far end. 

The residence was originally built near the Columbia Gorge, but was later completely dismantled, moved, and reassembled piece by piece at its current location.
