Carter did have to divest from his peanut farm, which you seem to be confused about what divest entails, it means to give up ownership, control or interests in rights or businesses/possessions. Carter had to turn his farm over to a trust which he had absolutely no say in. Trump is not divested because his family still technically controls the businesses and calls the shots.

science,ff7yp7q,t1_ff7xkyp,1579661529.0,"Any given night is completely different from the last, which is the main problem with narcolepsy, lack of consistency. Narcolepsy is your brains inability or difficulty regulating normal sleeping patterns. Some nights it feels like I'm up all night long and never even got to shut my eyes, meaning I spent most of the night in light stages of sleep. Some nights I completely conk out immediately and stay that way, but other times I'll fall asleep right away, but get up 30 minutes later and spend the rest of the night awake.

Also, when most people think of narcolepsy they associate it with cataplexy, which isn't what a lot of people think it is, or how its displayed in popular culture. Cataplexy is when your muscles suddenly give out or become extremely weak and some people kind of seem to ""pass out"" if its strong enough, though in reality they remain conscious. I've only experienced slight muscle weakness when I get extremely emotional or cry, but it's not enough to cause a fainting episode, which is one of the reasons I'm considered to have high functioning narcolepsy.

It's a shitty disorder."

It's more about not being able to obtain ""restful"" sleep, rather than the amount of time I spend laying down. My brain never really seems to shut off or register that it's time to rest.

There's times where I get 5 hours of sleep and end up with over an hour of restful sleep and times where I sleep 12 hours and end up with 20 minutes. For me at least, it seems completely out of my control."
science,ff7xi0y,t1_ff7ws46,1579660696.0,"Not necessarily. In my case I can lay down to go to sleep, and while i may gain some kind of benefit from the act of resting, a lot of times i never truly feel like i fall asleep. Other times i feel like I've slept but like I haven't recieved any benefit or like I'm not really rested. Most of the time you could walk into my room at my deepest state of sleep and whisper to me and I'd probably hear you and get up, if I wasnt already awake.

I've had periods where I don't ever actually fall asleep or feel that I have for days on end. The longest it's ever gone for me was almost a full week. So while narcoleptics can and do attempt to sleep, their ability to benefit from states of deep sleep is greatly diminished due to the disorder, which is essentially our brains inability to regulate normal sleeping patterns.

This is likely what they mean. It's pretty much a constant state of limbo. Never truly awake, never really asleep."
