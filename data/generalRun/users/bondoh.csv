We’ve literally seen the main things that are coming; and whenever they divert from those things or extend other segments it’s like ...come on!!

The monster association arc has been pretty damn long. I don’t really want them to extend it that much longer beyond making the fights more detailed. I want to see the main event and finally move on to new stuff

OnePunchMan,ffggtvj,t1_fffvpye,1579905918.0,"Well technically we are cutting away to other heroes dicking around, just not somewhere else in the world.

A lot of mangas that don’t do a lot of detail have the anime’s add some extra (not just silly “let’s have a picnic” type stuff either but actually extending the original scenes, adding extra parts to fights, etc)
By definition that is filler, even if it’s good filler. 
Because It’s sort of “filling out” the more bare boned original.
And frankly that is what the manga is doing for the webcomic so that the anime doesn’t have to 

Let’s just face it: we all read the webcomic. We’ve seen the main beats of the original story. If we could say it went 1 2 3 4 5 6 7...
Then this manga is going more like 1 (abc) 2 (def) 3 (ghi).. etc

And that is the definition of filler in many ways.

Some of us don’t necessarily want the original story extended as much as we want to see brand new story (not brand new stuff in between but totally new)
So in a perfect world, I wish they’d just adapt the web comic (though adding a little to the fights like they did with Boros is totally cool and basically the entire point that stops me from thinking “I’ll just go reread the webcomic”) go through all the main s-class vs fights, do garou, dark shine, do >!the base flip and the s-class comeback and silver fangs big moment, golden sperm, and finally awakened garou, then you can do the sisters arc, the recent ninja stuff and!< then ONE would have to hurry up and either do the webcomic more or—-even better the manga could finally pass the webcomic and we might actually get to stuff like >!blast, God, the organization, and whatever else is to come!<

HunterXHunter,ff8cxe9,t1_ff6jsol,1579673351.0,"I’ll admit I was thinking more about strength and speed and forgot how durable mereum is.


Netero isn’t too durable though (in comparison)

I do think it’s a little unfair to act like a nuke is the absolute minimum power to kill mereum though. He did technically survive one but it turned him into such a state that without his guards feeding them their own flesh, he would’ve died for sure.

So i think it’s fair to say that if a nuke put him into a state where he was at death’s door, or actually more accurately, fried him to a crisp... then someone could probably kill him with less.

How much less? Hard to say. Pitou felt Gon-San was nearly as strong as the king and I doubt his Jajanken’s were nuke level.

I will share one theory to see what you think: I think (some) of the speed in opm (like Ninja speed) is on a whole different level then hxh.

Of course hxh has the typical “they move so fast I can hardly keep up” thing and they can bounce off walls and ceilings like Gran Torino in mha but ....that doesn’t necessarily translate into the kind of superspeed some might imagine and us more for visual effect.
My proof is this cheetu, because as fast as even average nen users may seem, they were nothing like cheetu, who made even knuckles and morel look slow when he fought them (though he lacked power to do much to them)

But in reality cheetu is stated to only run about 200km/h (126 mph)

Speed O Sound Sonic breaks the sound barrier constantly, which requires at least over 766mph. He does this in both straight lines and when bouncing around.

I think even mereum might struggle with speed like that (though Sonic’s attacks probably couldn’t do damage due to kings insane durability)

Netero’s speed was all in his hands (sort of like atomic samurai) but he couldn’t move his body that fast.

I’d argue if you replaced mereum with sonic, he probably would’ve beaten netero faster

And honestly I think Nyan was just being silly. It’s not like that cat has researched whether people change back.
He was just trying to be funny/scary and doing that whole “once you go black you never go back” kinda statement but changing it to monster.

With that said, the rest of your argument makes a lot of sense and even if garou could be considered human now, I bet your right that he could transform again.

There’s even an argument that in a way lots of s-class types (not just zombie) like pig-god or even flashy or tornado are monsters in a way.

But you said yourself Phoenix Man wasn’t a monster after the suit came off and more importantly the definition of monster is very weird.

As I said in the other thread, I would concede you have convinced me that garou was at one point a monster. But there’s a 2nd and equally important question: is he still a monster?

All of the monster qualities seem to fade off him. That was what seemed to visually represented.

Also you mentioned that everyone but bang and saitama called him a monster but if anything I would use that as my argument.
They were being weak and scared and not seeing the humanity left in him. They were angry and simply wanted to execute him because he dared to beat them, even though he never killed anyone and arresting him would be an option but they were hell bent on killing him. These are the type of people that only saw a monster.
Saitama (someone not scared——despite not always having the perfect track record—-saw the bigger picture “you’re a nice guy. You’re even going easy on me.”

And bang for sure could see beyond the bad behavior and see the human within 

And you forgot someone: the kid. The little kid garou kept saving was like “no he’s not a monster he’s a hero and he saved me twice!”

So i can’t put much stock in the opinions of the other s-class, heck even tank top master said something about “he doesn’t feel human” way back when he was clearly still human but that was more of a way of saying “this guy is scary and won’t stop and keeps coming at me despite how much damage he took.”"

I’m starting to think you could be right, but I still feel a lot of it was undone. 

Who are all the monsters that went to live normal lives?
I know armored gorilla for example but he started off his life as a gorilla and was given intelligence.

Did any of those monsters start off as 100% human? (I know rover was a dog, Sperm was a ....well...)

I do think it would almost be fair to split this into two questions:
1. Was garou ever a monster? According to ONE’s
Statement: I guess he may have been
2. Is garou currently a monster? Because as you put it, he seemed to have “turned back”

He only seemed to be a monster when he was awakened garou, and he was definitely not awakened garou when he fled at the end of the fight

That’s my opinion. But I’m definitely open to being changed (I’ve already changed from thinking he was never a monster to thinking he was one for a while)

I know in another comment xxyvexx, you mentioned something like “well how would he change back? Would dr genus do something?”

But that goes to the point that he was a very different kind of monster compared to a crab man. He didn’t just explode and change.

It’s my understanding (without having seen this thing from ONE) that Garou is basically an s-class type human being (which dr genus did say is very similar to monsters but not monsters) and on top of being that he began the actual monsterification process when he became AG, but when saitama beat him it was undone and his monster shell literally fell off.

No passion whatsoever. No sense of the characters.
I mean genos, for example, you can really hear everything you need to hear just in the way he says “sensei!!!”. It defines his character (the extreme respect for saitama) and the sub nails it
But the dub he just growls “master” while trying to sound cool.

OnePunchMan,fejd275,t3_ep942g,1579168008.0,"I’ve never seen a manga that could have more quality spinoffs

I’d love to see one for basically all the s-class, especially zombie-man, tatsumaki, flashy flash >!though an antihero sonic would be even better!<, and puri puri prisoner

Also sonic could have one or he and flashy could share the same book.

Mob psycho 100 (and how deep it went with the variety of powers espers can have) could’ve easily been about tatsumaki (though it would’ve lost some of the best stuff like reigen and middle school charm but maybe that gets brought in another way or maybe mob himself becomes a side character)

But the ninjas, zombie man and puri puri prisoner I want so bad for different reasons. The latter because he’s so fucking hilarious, the second because he’s like if Wolverine fell into a Gotham city vibe, and I just love the idea that he wins by outlasting his opponents and his fights can go for days.
That would have a really hard time getting old to me.
And last but not least the first because holy shit ONE’s concept of super speed may very well be my favorite in all of fiction and that’s really saying something. Though I have a soft spot for the whole “moving so fast time seems to slow to a crawl” thing, the explosive movement of the ninjas and how it wrecks the environment is so cool.

I honestly don’t just think these spin offs are a good idea, but necessary. You can’t follow the main story of OPM, follow saitama and genos and their fights against villains plus all the other amazing characters and even hope to get 2% of the depth you could go into with a character like prisoner or zombie.

Your best case scenario is getting a couple of amazing fights (like with the vampire) and a side story here and there but those are tiny scenes in a much bigger story.

Imagine if all you did was explore what goes on with Zombie, or built an entire world around prisoner (where say for example, we’d get some really interesting cell mates, and the warden could be an interesting guy and we could have the equivalent of some US Marshall who’s like Judge Dredd who’s puri’s mortal enemy, along with some robocop sidekick.

I’d be willing to bet he won’t spare another one that he’s forced to punch. The reason rover is an exception is because he’s not malicious and was just a mindless dog.

So much so that there have been tragedies regarding the subject (the so called “trans-panic defense” which I don’t agree with but it’s worth mentioning that people felt so strongly that it existed)

You can believe “trans women are women and the fact that they are is just medical history” but a huuuuuge amount of people disagree. A huuuuge
Amount of people think trans-woman are a separate category all together and if a man who thinks that way is intending to date a cis-woman but comes across a trans-woman, he needs to know.

You say these types of men should wear a flag or something but since there are *significantly* less trans people than there are cis, that just doesn’t make sense and isn’t practical.

And for gods sakes no one should ever suggest wearing a flag or some such thing....it’s really a simple issue of people being honest and being willing to discuss things.

As I said in another comment: let’s recap

The guy said it felt rapey, but didn’t say why. This discussion of what all he felt mislead about lead to the fertility part  and someone saying “lol so that’s rape?!?” but he never said that part was what felt rapey. 

I would wager a guess that it has more to do with the fact that he thought it was a cis-woman and it wasn’t, which he has every right to be weirded out about and it is extremely misleading to pretend you’re a cis-person when you’re actually trans because society has a wide range of views on trans-people as is their right.
—-end original comment:

So again. No it’s not the same as women being on birth control because the issue was never the fertility in the first place.
(Though in a completely different subject if a woman were pretending to try to have a child but actually couldn’t, that would be a type of fraud. But that’s not what we are talking about)"
