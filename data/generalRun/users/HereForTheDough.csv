My thoughts are that, as capitalism becomes increasingly unviable, people will demand changes. Scandinavian countries are leading that sort of change now. Sentiment in the USA is certainly shifting, with young people open to socialism and even middle-ground candidates discussing things like UBI. 

I suspect that the bandaids being put in place will be insufficient and people will grow angry with the trends displayed by the ultra-wealthy and multinational corporations.

The elite are already hiding a significant portion of the entire liquid wealth in existence in offshore and hidden locations where they are completely untaxed. That will have to be addressed ultimately, and capitalism has no mechanics in place to do so. They have stolen and hidden so much of the value produced by others that they could survive off it for thousands of years regardless of the success of ongoing business ventures, if not forever given the power of interest and the power of that liquid wealth to corrupt things in their favor.

>Again, purely from a semantic point of view I don't think the word capitalism or capitalist should be stigmatized any more than socialism or socialist. Ideas thrive when people can openly discuss them without being judged by labels. The left needs unity to win the election, not aggression.

I sort of agree, especially when the terms have come to mean specific things in context rather than being held to their academic definitions. Adam Smith would certainly disagree with much of what we consider to be capitalism in practice.

I personally do not see capitalism and rewarding individual merit as separate from each other. Say that a worker in a union-owned factory and creates a device or system that increases productivity for everyone else by 10%. He should absolutely be rewarded with a portion of that increased productivity for all. There is nothing in that concept inherently against socialism. Nobody is saying that hard work and innovation shouldn't reap wonderful rewards for the person who discovers them through his own labor, only that their children should not inherit that benefit by virtue of nothing, and that the rewards for such things shouldn't take the form of the ability to destabilize politics in their favor. And that 'owning' the factory shouldn't earn more money than anyone laboring within it."

Why do you think capital gains taxes are so small compared to the ones that poor laborers pay? When 90% of all the stocks are owned by the top 10%?

History of USA using 'lack of resources' as an excuse to commit atrocities.

>At a processing center in El Paso, Texas, 900 migrants were “being held at a facility designed for 125. In some cases, cells designed for 35 people were holding 155 people,” The New York Times reported. One observer described the facility to Texas Monthly as a “human dog pound.” The government’s own investigators have found detainees in facilities run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement being fed expired food at detention facilities, “nooses in detainee cells,” “inadequate medical care,” and “unsafe and unhealthy conditions.” An early-July inspector-general report found “dangerous overcrowding” in some Border Patrol facilities and included pictures of people crowded together like human cargo. More than 50,000 people are being held in facilities run by ICE, and something close to 20,000 in facilities run by Customs and Border Protection, and more than 11,000 children in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services.*  (The government describes them as “unaccompanied,” a label immigration advocates say is misleading because many were separated by the government from the relative who brought them) Some of the people detained by the U.S. government have entered the United States illegally or overstayed their visas; some are simply seeking to exercise their legal right to asylum.

news,ffon8ah,t1_ffok6nr,1580079461.0,"Kobe has skills, but they are arbitrary and useless outside of a specific environment. Tyson has skills that, thus far, are timeless and universally valuable. Probably hundreds of arbitrary ""move the ball towards a goal"" games have come and gone. Pugilism has been a mainstay.

Furthermore, barrier to entry is a big thing. That's why soccer is so respected internationally. The barrier to entry is minute, just flat ground and a round object. Anyone can play it, so there's a huge field of competition to be at the top level. Basketball? Not so much. You need a court, a ball that bounces appropriately, stable hoops at the correct height, shoes play a larger role, etc. 

Know what takes no equipment and is open to anyone with the willpower to get hit and not quit? Physical combat. Largest possible field of contenders.

Sure, Tyson technically boxed in a controlled and arbitrary environment constrained by a set of rules, but far less so than something like the NBA. Most of the rules of boxing are in place to save the majority of Tyson's challengers from death or serious injury, not to protect the crowd-drawing ballhogs.

I think that in a few decades very few people will still talk about Kobe as anything other than a weird thing their dads used to say when throwing things. When LeBron and Jordan die, this will be erased. When the next incarnations of those guys die, they will be forgotten as well. 

I don't think the same is true of Tyson or his legacy. Additionally, Kobe has never been a remorseful or redemptive character. Tyson has expressed remorse and done a lot to repair his image and had a much more difficult upbringing and experience from the son of an NBA player who succeeded after being born and bred for it with every advantage. Its like the basketball version of the Marley kids making reggae...although he did surpass his predecessor and they are pathetic imitations..."

Differences:
1. Kobe settled out-of-court and apologized, and said that it took him months to recognize the lack of consent.
2. Ronaldo's accuser is a proven liar, either from signing a contract that wasn't honest previously, or lying about it now.
3. The basic functioning of the court system resulted in a de facto finding of his innocence. Kobe avoided charges through a secret agreement with the victim.

So yeah, Kobe paid and avoided examination of his criminal actions by the justice system. Ronaldo did not, was examined, and was not charged.
