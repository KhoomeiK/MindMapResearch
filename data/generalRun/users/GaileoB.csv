bipolar,ffx9vd0,t1_ffx7ebo,1580320772.0,"I've done some stuff that is out of the ordinary for me that were supposed to be episodes, like try to drive to New Orleans when I had only thought of the idea for like an hour.  I track my moods 3 times a day and also have a lot of symptom/activity trackers in it too."
bipolar2,ffx9nsy,t1_ffx9ba9,1580320647.0,"I've been severely depressed before but the longest it lasts is like 1 - 1 1/2 weeks. I've been on Latuda for like 4 months now and I dont really get depressed anymore, maybe some mild depression but that's it. I track a lot of symptoms and habits (drinking) to see what correlates. I've technically been diagnosed by 2 psychs and had 2 other people agree with it. My husband and in laws agree with it but they never mentioned anything about mood swings before I was diagnosed."
bipolar2,ffx85mq,t1_ffx7qsl,1580319752.0,I have an appointment with my psych on Tuesday.
bipolar,ffx4rj0,t1_ffx4mi5,1580317732.0,"I've been pretty stable on meds the past couple months. I'm doubting if I've ever actually gotten ""true hypomania"" or if I was just not depressed?"
bipolar,ffx4mft,t1_ffx4cxe,1580317645.0,"So, like I've been told I get delusional which is why my psych thinks I'm for sure bipolar cause it only happens when I'm hypomanic. I just feel like I'm subconsciously faking it and stuff. But I mainly get mild to moderate depression, but I've been very suicidal a decent amount of times."
bipolar2,ffx3fgm,t1_ffx376o,1580316922.0,"I do track my moods. 3 times a day and show it to my counselor/psych every once in a while. It's pretty much been in the neutral range for the last 2 months. I'm probably gonna ask my psych when I see her next week, but she'll probably just say I feel that way because I'm ""in an upswing"" though I think I'm fine."
BipolarReddit,ffvyqgb,t1_ffvyiy0,1580277504.0,Yeah I had already been feeling kinda weird/up for like the past week.
BipolarReddit,ffvw94p,t1_ffvvnyx,1580275166.0,"I only had 2, would that actually enough to make me hypomanic? I took my Latuda which normally makes me sleep, but all I feel is a little sleepy but I could definitely stay awake."
bipolar2,ffvrtbu,t1_ffvc2bm,1580271449.0,"That's where I'm at, but neutral is a peppy-ish mood for me."
BipolarReddit,ffvnise,t1_ffvnb6j,1580268316.0,I've never really felt like that before. It feels kind of like I'm waiting on some kind of order?
bipolar,ffvmr35,t1_ffvlfpx,1580267791.0,Why is that your first thought
BipolarReddit,ffvga6j,t1_ffvg447,1580263426.0,"I feel like I'm just waiting for God to say something to me, I'm not really sure tbh. He hasn't said anything to me, but it feels like he's about to. Other people are telling me to go to sleep and that I'm on the verge of psychosis, but I felt fine today until I had a couple of energy drinks."
bipolar,ffvfjo6,t1_ffvfgcz,1580262935.0,What am I supposed to do lol. It's like 9pm
bipolar,ffvevv2,t1_ffvee84,1580262494.0,Like 13-14 hours
bipolar,ffvdk4i,t1_ffvd2pu,1580261601.0,"I felt fine until I drank them, I slept all night last night. I wasn't really talking to God but starting feeling like I was about to talk to him."
bipolar,ffvcwd0,t1_ffvcht7,1580261153.0,"I don't feel tired rn, but I'm assuming that's cause I had 2 Monsters."
bipolar,ffro8ri,t1_ffro2ze,1580162163.0,"Yeah, I'm pretty stable on my current meds so I doubt they'd change anything even if the diagnosis changes."
bipolar,ffrn5go,t1_ffqgzdm,1580161501.0,"My psych said that she's not sure what form of BP I have since I get delusional (which leans towards BP1) but that I was also rapid cycling (which leans towards BP2). Like, how do I get delusional since I'm pretty sure I've never had a full-blown manic episode?"
BipolarReddit,ffreyw2,t1_ffreknj,1580156730.0,Same. Like how do you go through your day just not having constant thoughts?
bipolar,ffpeoy6,t1_ffpe1ea,1580093179.0,"Its Daylio. It has a free version and a premium version. I think the premium version is worth it, I think the app is great."
bipolar,ffpemtx,t3_euh02k,1580093137.0,I got the same one after like 2 weeks of using the app lol
bipolar,ffos0x8,t1_ffor7ma,1580080931.0,"Yeah, I dont want to stop my meds cause a lot of times when I get hypo I decide to go out and get drunk and end up getting arrested.  My husband couldn't handle that again, and probably wouldn't want to stay with someone who was constantly starting and stopping their meds that kept them relatively sane."
bipolar,ffonq35,t1_ffnxefu,1580079652.0,I like Daylio. You can get a premium version of it too. I used to use eMoods and Daylio together but stopped using eMoods cause I couldn't remember what time I fell asleep lol.
