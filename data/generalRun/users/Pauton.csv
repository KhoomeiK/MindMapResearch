Advice,ff931iv,t3_esast4,1579703621.0,"It’s not weird at all for the girl to make the first move and most guys are glad when it happens because unfortunately its so rare and it makes us feel appreciated and valued which is something many men don‘t experience a lot.  
Ask him if he was laid off or why he isn‘t working there anymore. From there you can have a normal conversation and ask him if he‘d like to do something some time together. 
From what I got from your post you don‘t know each other very well yet so keep in mind that it doesn‘t have to become a serious relationship maybe you two are better suited as friends. Or maybe he is the love of your life but you‘ll never know unless you ask him. 
Also keep in mind that he WILL be anxious too if you go on a date with him you‘re not alone in that regard at all. 

Small dating advice that helped me a couple times:
If you go to the movies, go eat something after the movie, that way you are guaranteed to have something to talk about and there are no awkward silences"

Dudes text her on instagram obviously trying to get into her pants (even if they live halfway across the world wtf?) and she doesn't seem to get it.

Talk to you GF and explain the dangers and how this is not normal!"

memes,feh54j4,t1_fegvday,1579109339.0,Well of course the poor people wont get fat. But the previously poor people who are now getting access to cheaper greasier and generally unhealthier foods are possibly being affected by this. Mind you I‘m only speculating here I habe nothing to prove this

Kinda the same how they won't stop making children even when the children actually survive childhood because of modern healthcare.  
Their routine is to eat as much as they have to survive but if their food doesn't run out they get obese"
relationships,feg7nd8,t3_eovasc,1579080883.0,Honestly what your husband said is horrible but sounds just like a joke a fucking retard like me would make especially when sick and not thinking correctly. I suggest you talk to him about it. Ask him if he really thinks you should loose weight. If he stands by his statement fuck him but maybe it was a a tasteless joke and he wasn't thinking of your history and how that would affect you

AskReddit,fedze3h,t1_fedyoey,1579023101.0,"I'm not saying that I am looking at men and women as resources I'm saying that IF you were to do that a women would be more valuable. And yes of course it takes two to make a baby but you only need one man to get many women pregnant. 1 Women cant have sex with 100 men and just start poping out babys every few hours.   
I feel like you severely misunderstood my point and looking at the score of my previous comment it seems like multiple people did.  
We're talking about 1912 here, a time where manpower was a valuable resource and therefore rescuing more women makes more sense from an economical standpoint but not from a moral one of course"
AskReddit,fedjcic,t1_fedb135,1579012993.0,If you look at men and women as resources a woman is much more valuable than a man. A man can impregnate 100 woman a day but you need 100 woman to produce a 100 babys in 9 months. Back in the day more humans were necessary to advance as a society so while it is discriminating it is at least because of an actual reason
AskReddit,feddobg,t3_eo6l00,1579008603.0,"Back in Highschool my sisters phone was confiscated because she used it in class. The teachers would keep confiscated phones for the rest of the day, so a period later my sister went to the teacher and told him she needed to make an important call to her doctor and got her phone back to make the call. She just took the her phone and left for the day and surprisingly our mother actually backed her up on it and she never got any punishment for it. Although the teacher hated her for the rest of the year and me being the younger sibling, of course that teacher hated me too after that.

Another time we had this asshat of a teacher that would put questions in the exams that we never covered thus making the exam almost impossible for us to pass. So we did the only logical thing and just started loudly discussing the questions during the exam with the whole class and even started to just form groups and solved the exams together. Surprisingly the teacher basically did nothing about it. Every now and then he'd just look up from his laptop and tell us to not share answers and looked back down. In retrospect I think that teacher just didn't give a single fuck about anything and the exams were mostly pulled from god knows where with just remotely similar topics to what we were actually supposed to study"
Advice,fe7wcrt,t1_fe6qd6p,1578919935.0,"dude your whole paragraph is literally one sentence. Not a single comma or period which makes it really annoying to read.  
To your problem: getting out of that job seems like a good choice although at a bad time. I can only agree with PATRIOT880 you need to give everything you've got to get out of that situation. What about moving in with you GF? Seems like a pretty good solution to me"
Advice,fe6tt7k,t1_fe2m7jw,1578905117.0,Taking her out to a nice restaurant is a good idea although it feels like I should at least give her something physical too. I‘ll see if I can find any nice necklaces that aren‘t too expensive. Thanks for your help!
Advice,fe2jn7c,t1_fe2iu87,1578839172.0,Can't agree more. Blocking and ignoring is the best tactic. Many of these people have hundreds of potential targets and most likely you're not actually that interesting to him
Advice,fe2j9tr,t3_enkxj8,1578839026.0,"Honestly I wouldn't worry about it. A friend of mine had a similiar incident a few months back where someone accessed her phones camera and took pictures of her changing and demanded 700 Euros to not send them to her contact list. She obviously didn't pay and went to the police (who of course didn't do anything). As of today no pictures were ever leaked and nothing more happened.   
I think your situation is less worse as since he only has a picture with you face remotely on it and is not actually threatening you actively I say just wait it out"
Advice,fe2hcx6,t1_fe28xll,1578838384.0,"I think norfolk82 is trying to say to just go for it and that would be my advice too. You have to ask her and you should do it rather sooner than later. If she agrees, great if she doesn't that sucks but it isn't the end of the world.   
At the end of the day it doesn't really matter what you say to her as long as you're not portraying yourself as someone you're not."
