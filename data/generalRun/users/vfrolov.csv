bbbs,fcpbu5e,t3_ehua0p,1577857539.0,"The answer to your anxiety is straightforward: you just have to apply. The organizations of the kind you’d be volunteering with, whether BBBS, or another, tend to have a pretty solid selection process. If you find yourself accepted, it means you fit the profile of what they are looking for in a volunteer. You may want to ask what made them decide one or the other way if you like, but I would trust their judgment.

From what I know about BBBS, for example, they (or at least most of the chapters) wouldn’t care about whether you are financially stable, or what your living situation at this point in life is, etc. They would care about whether you think straight, and are able and willing to commit to the program for at least a year.

The kids need an adult friend outside their usual circle. They need someone to talk to who is more experienced than they are – someone who has navigated through the issues of adolescence, for example. And they need someone who can help them discover more of the world through shared experiences.

You may not be the most creative person, but you don’t have to be like among the top 10% of creative people to make a difference in a kid’s life. You also don’t have to do anything out of the ordinary. First, things which are ordinary for you may be extraordinary for another. Second, having an adult or older friend who is dependable, is actually paying attention, and doesn’t invalidate them is quite often extraordinary in itself.

If you find you would like ideas for what you could do together with the kid beyond what you typically do on your own, you can always A) ask other volunteers about what they have been up to with their mentees, B) ask your program manager (as they tend to know what other people in the program are up to), or C) read on the experiences of / advice from BBBS volunteers on the web, among other options.

You may indeed feel more “ready” at a later point in life. But how you feel right now doesn’t necessarily reflect reality. Since this is something you already want, I’d definitely encourage you to just apply and see where the process takes you."

How much of the progress is actually due to therapy, and how much of it is just due to the whatever it was wrong with the dog becoming okay again on its own?"

ketoscience,fab8iv9,t3_e8ekhi,1575919373.0,"Due to the nature of my work, I frequently come across studies related to cardiovascular conditions and diabetes, but I don't yet have a mental framework to be confident about my understanding of them. I am interested in hearing educated comments on some of the studies so as to develop at least a somewhat better understanding of how to interpret the science behind dietary recommendations, as well as how they relate to keto. This is one of such studies.

I personally have been on keto diet for over half a year now, and I like it because it's helped me stop my addiction to sweets."
