AskReddit,ff88hsd,t1_ff7dhq8,1579669072.0,"When I was a teen Chalice Bearer the adults had this frat like tradition where the new priest had to chug all the leftover brandy we used. It was ended when they had the tiny new priest do it (she was like 5 foot and 90 pounds) and she got tipsy enough to sprain her ankle because she had to wear big heels to not drag the vestments on the floor. This was probably like a cup of brandy at least. 

She was one of my favorites and was all “girls, wear flats if you plan on drinking in college” after she slipped which somehow horrified the frat crew. It is a treasured memory."
badwomensanatomy,ff83wak,t1_ff6ayry,1579665309.0,"Well, r/abrathatfits will give you a good primer and so will reading up on sister sizes. I’m assuming you are a North American dude; North America tends to size to a too small cup and too large band to fit the more limited size range."

badwomensanatomy,ff5dkye,t1_ff5debf,1579588425.0,"Several places did, including a specialty bra shop I got upset in and gave myself a welt while trying to show how the band didn’t fit. I’m tall so I was obviously a big band size in that sizing view."
badwomensanatomy,ff5c1yw,t1_ff510vm,1579586789.0,"A small band size and larger cup size isn’t that big, though. They’ve likely been sized wrong. I’m a 34DD, and while I’m busty I’m not super busty. A short woman who should be wearing a 28E is probably not going to get their size when they got fitted into a 34 band sister size. I was sized as a 38B for years and had to throw a hell of a fit to get my mom to take me to Nordstrom where I was properly sized into a 32D so my boobs stopped falling out of my bra."

The trick is to just balance flat until you are comfortable, because it is easy enough to either hop off or put one foot on the floor when you need a moment. And I’m 5’11”, so I’ve always been fairly tall when using one. 

It’s like at home playground equipment as an adult."
AskReddit,fewakfq,t1_fetysst,1579407594.0,"I grew up with the very wealthy. Shit was wild. I knew someone with a library like half the size of my very large house; her dad had built in multiple secret rooms you could access like you were in some sort of spy novel. It was amazing; he’d built in a little fairy castle sort of room that at 12ish we were a bit too old for, but we all ignored that. The entire house was just nuts; if they could be extra in the kid spaces, they did it. 

And my friend always wanted to come over to my house because we had better board games."

My college was going to be paid for, but we were not nearly both sets of grandparents own homes in various, exclusive locations well off. 

You have to be ready to have those conversations because it was weird to be eight and rapidly move between being the rich kid and poor kid in a weekend.

In late elementary or early middle school in the US, we had to bring in something related to the spice trade. I was sent with a brand new jar of mixed peppercorns. I kept it, and accidentally started a trend of everyone daring each other to eat them. Warheads were big at the time, so it was a natural expansion of our desires to see who could suffer the most while making no faces. 

If you ever want to look badass while eating a peppercorn from a mixed selection, I found the white and pink best. Made some pocket money with that knowledge."

Her parents knew, my parents knew, admin knew, and the wheels were turning for help by the time I got back from lunch because my teacher was badass. I’d told her on my way to lunch. 

It really did work out for the best; she was really depressed because her dad was being a dick more into his mistress and hadn’t been spending time with her. He had previously been the sort of dad we loved to hang out with. He knew all the good card games, and would build shit with us, help us cook, and just really, deeply fucked up for a couple of months. 

The whole situation got him to agree to family therapy, and they repaired things. I probably shouldn’t have been told any of this, but I’m going to give both her parents a break for over sharing with a kid because they were terrified and so thankful I knew what to do."
