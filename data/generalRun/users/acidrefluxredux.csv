They closed the store but employees stayed to give out coffee, food, blankets and other supplies from the store to victims and first responders.  An example of humanity on an otherwise terrible day. Didn't know about the plaque.  Well deserved."

todayilearned,fe68jvd,t3_envw3m,1578884136.0,"I remember this.  I lived very close to where that happened.  I could hear it.  If I remember correctly, the man parked his car on the train track and doused it in gasoline then changed his mind about killing himself and walked away leaving the car on the track to kill and injury all those people.  Really terrible."
