Also, it's completely normal and natural for you to feel this way, especially considering it was your fiance. The thing is though, you can't allow it to spread so much that it becomes toxic and warps who you always have been. Yes, she may be beautiful, but everyone is beautiful. You're beautiful, too, and there's no such thing as 'more' beautiful. How on earth could we even begin to measure something as elusive as beauty? There's been no constant in what's considered beauty across history, and there never will be, and that's why we can never quantify it. So no, she cannot be 'more' than you are, any more than I could be 'more' than any other woman. Our fight is not and should never be with each other. Your fight should be to heal from the relationship that you were in. Focus on yourself, write down all the qualities that you adore about yourself, all your achievements, all the things that you're proud of. Your ex doesn't determine who is better and who isn't. He sounds repulsive from the little I read about him, so you definitely shouldn't allow his decisions to contort your vision of yourself."

bulletjournal,fem8wqu,t1_fem6yxt,1579244082.0,"That's very true, and I also try my best to think of it that way because I do know what it feels like to have your education ripped from you. It's just a bit stressful because I'm working as well and I have to do another separate course to appease cultural and religious expectations."
