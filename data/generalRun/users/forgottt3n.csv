MMA,ffjkssq,t1_ffiwlsn,1580000507.0,"As someone who trains all the time I actually do  understand why you'd go limp. For one thing going limp is a good way to slip out of some holds.

Second, learning to relax your muscles is probably the single most important skill for any beginning martial artist in any art. Knowing how to actively relax your muscles is crucial to having any kind of gas tank. Boxers shoulders and core are totally relaxed in a fight only using enough energy to keep their hands physically in front of their face until the moment they need to absorb an impact on their guard at which point they tense. Kickboxers are the same way for the same reason. Brazilian jiu jitsu is the art of being perfectly comfortable while being totally uncomfortable. Look at how Khabib reacted to Porier's guillotine. He just sat there nice and still and totally relaxed because he knew he wasn't in danger and instead he turned it into a break for himself while porier burned up his arms. In jiu jitsu it's all about taking things as slowly and as low energy as possible until you see your moment to explode. Going limp is also a good way to get out of some takedowns like dead legging a single. 

The first thing that a coach will tell you when you train is to relax. In boxing they have you shake out your shoulders to loosen them up. New guys come in with tense shoulders and they don't last more than a round because their chest core and shoulders are all tense and tight and burning constant energy. In jiu jitsu new guys will constantly be squeezing grabbing and pressing. They'll be jittery and stiff. They're constantly pressing into you or pulling you towards them instead of just relaxing and as a result they burn their tank in minutes. 

So yeah I actually kind of can see why someone would go limp in a fight. However in my personal opinion anyone with the kind of experience Robbie has should know the consequences of going limp like that. If he did relax he should have done it in a way that was obvious he wasn't out. IMO if Robbie knew he wasn't in any danger and just wanted to let Askren burn himself on this sub he would have absolutely just relaxed and decided to go with it but my personal opinion is also that he was out based on the way he did that. He should have known better if he was still awake and if his judgement was clouded by the choke then he was basically out as is.

I've never gone limp quite like that. I've been told as far as fighters go sometimes I'm almost too relaxed so I've gotten pretty good at the art of chilling out in a shit spot and I've never just let my hand go like that. I'll always set it down myself before relaxing or just keep it there ready and relax everything else. There isn't a reason IMO to hang your hand down there. So like I said while I can see a reason why someone would go limp I definitely don't think I could see this situation being a good time to do what he did.

Edit:LMAO always good to see the guys who don't train roll through to downvote because martial arts in reality isn't like how they assume it is in their mind. They can never seem to leave responses though. ""I don't have any experience of the subject but that sounds wrong to me."""

dankmemes,ffdnxrb,t1_ffczi5g,1579824906.0,"Honestly I don't get it myself as a guy who's bisexual the ass sits in a strange place. Girls with a flat ass aren't as much of a turnoff as guys with a flat ass. But simultaneously when someone is talking about someone with small tits and a big ass that isn't just about sacrificing tits for ass it's specifically the woman's overall body shape. Something about that shape is just exceptionally hot and I can't explain it but I understand it. It's funny because technically it's pear shaped but I guess when I say that I'm talking about girls like Jada Stevens who isn't what anyone would call a traditional pear shape. Just more like fit but bottom heavy.

Then again as far as bisexual dudes go my taste is broad so maybe I see things a little different. I think chicks that look a little masculine are cute, especially girls with strong jaws. Dated a girl who was maybe 95lbs super skinny feminine frame but she had a rock solid jaw on her, harder jawline than my own (which admittedly is fairly hard I think) and it was so hot. One of the most gorgeous girls I ever met. Again though it's not that my standards are low but I like all kinds of body shapes. Skinny, curvy, I'm not a fan of muscular guys but muscular chicks are hot, different skin colors, etc. 

I think people in general are capable of having great bodies but they need to work on them. A dude who's a lazy skinny 140lbs isn't cute like a dude who works on his 190lb frame.  Girls who get big asses just because they're heavy but don't work out are a turn off. Shapely asses from someone who works out, regardless of size, is hot. Thick chicks and dudes regardless of if they're muscular and veiny or toned and smooth are hot as long as they're not flabby."

AbsoluteUnits,ffae1wk,t1_ff9xbuq,1579733406.0,"Which IMO is a great example of how people who actually need all these tools aren't buying a Victorinox. The package of your standard pliers grip style multitool is typically way more useful to guys who actually work in workshops all day than a Swiss. 

They way I look at it a Swiss is great for someone who works in an office or as a cop (I myself would still carry a multitool) or maybe as a tool you throw in a bag you carry someplace a little classier like a golf course but not typically something that you would ever reach for unless there were no other tools available. People who use multitools multiple times a day are going to be carrying the old-school Leatherman style folding pliers type multitool. 

It might not be Leatherman brand but it's going to have that format. Victorinox's folding pliers style tools have been much better received by the guys I work with and people I've met who use multitools daily. The [swiss tool](https://www.swissarmy.com/us/en/Products/Swiss-Army-Knives/SwissTools/c/SAK_SwissTool?ScrollPosition=716&maxResults=30) is something that most people who get elbow deep in an engine bay or work wood or electronics would pick up.

That said snakes are odd. They're emotionally simple creatures even by animal standards. Emotionally reptiles in general are kind of underdeveloped. When people talk about someone being a snake or a lizard or reptile they're usually talking in the context of being cold and uncaring. Snakes are capable of feeling stressed but how they process it emotionally is a little different. They're a bit like AI in video games. They have a list of needs and they seek to fulfill them.

To clarify, I don't have anything wrong inherently with religion. My family is Christian and while I don't go to church or pray I respect them. Private schools like this though shouldn't be operating in the capacity they do. They intentionally teach counter intuitive curriculum and are absolutely striving to indoctrinate students before they're old enough to make their own decisions about religion right and wrong. A proper Christian would allow someone to make their choice of their own accord. Someone with an agenda to push would spend all their time trying to make everything outside of the church seem evil or wrong. I mean Christ (pun intended) is there a reason why rainbows are now so ""wrong"" that people can't put them on a t shirt? The answer is there isn't unless you're a school who wants to indoctrinate children into believing that being different in their sexuality is evil.

My ex girlfriend in high school was one of these poor kids. She was homeschooled for a decade by what I would equate to southern religious extremists. She was entirely incapable of functioning in a normal social environment. We kissed and she had a mental breakdown over the ""moral dilema"" of just kissing someone. To this day she is constantly misserable because her upbringing taught her that being a normal human being makes her an evil person despite never harming a flu. Meanwhile her parents would regularly preach about how much more high and mighty they were than me and everyone else around while cracking racist remarks about black people and protesting gay rights.

Her dad was a total prick too. A misognist and just generally an asshole, always Holier than thow even while throwing around threats. I'd love to crack that guy in the jaw. He would talk about my exs purity and virginity in the creepiest way and between all that and the purity ball and all the other weird stuff they talked about and all the ""family secrets"" I wouldn't be surprised if he was a total creep.

Randleman wrestles so instead of learning to not get wrestled and get back up he learns jiu jitsu. Surprises Randleman with a guillotine. Got beat by Gonzaga so he learns to drop hellatious elbows from the guard and smashes him with them. Prior Crocop had said he didn't even like elbows on the ground. Just can't predict what rematch Crocop will do."

Sage actually reacted immediately when Herb said that, in fact he lets go right as herb is starting to tell him. I actually think he reached in, realized he was grabbing the fence, and immediately decided to pull his fingers out before Herb told him not to.

This screenshot is the moment herb tells him to let go. You can see his fingers aren't in it.

MMA,fe9qxuk,t1_fe9n8fr,1578940712.0,I'm aware there are ancient civilizations around the world but people aren't living in them like they do in Europe. Constructions like that exist literally all around the world on every continent. There aren't entire neighborhoods with thousands of people in them though where every single house is from the 1400s or before. There are people living in houses today in Europe that were built in the medieval era. there's probably dudes in Egypt right now living in the same house that their family lived in when King Tut was still alive

There's a decent chance when you buy a house there the key you're handed is hundreds of years old. As is the kitchen, and the wiring is a retrofit from the early 1900s, and the bathroom is from before the unification of Germany under Kaiser Willhelm, and everything else. Rich people can buy castles and estates but it doesn't mean that castle comes with modern amenaties. It probably hasn't been updated since the French Revolution. If you're spending all your money on a house a nice new one or modernized one might just not be available.

Plus this was 09, the Reem wasn't raking in 800k a fight back then. He wasn't exactly wealthy at this time.

MMA,fe9056i,t3_eo03yg,1578932830.0,"Hunt really is a nightmare matchup for guys like Lewis and Nelson when he was throwing bombs in the UFC. Nelson had some wrestling in him but when you build your whole game around finding ""that one shot"" during the fight it doesn't work so well in every situation. With Hunt you gotta find like 8 or 9 of those ""one shots"" during the fight to put him down. Christ even if a fresh Lewis threw that flying knee like the world depended on it and it landed clean there's a decent chance Hunt would shrug it right off and be like ""nah fahk u cunt.""  Hunt is a more technically accomplished striker than both but is just as capable of shutting the lights out. He can absolutely mangle your legs with those tree trunks of his killing your mobility and while he does get tired and does slow he absolutely never stops coming forward. Any decent point fighter like Volkanovski should make short work of Hunt on paper (at least the version we got in the UFC) but if you're someone who doesn't have reach who can't circle away and tires throwing bombs you may as well be trying to break down a brick wall with your bare hands. 

Granted Hunto used to be pretty good at snagging decisions back in his prime days when he was exclusively fighting in kickboxing where theoretically his style should fair even worse. I wish we got to see prime Hunt in the UFC but by the time we got him he was a long ways into his career. I mean you gotta be an absolute animal to go back and forth with Jerome Lebanner over the course of a full fight."
videos,fe8rhxn,t1_fe8mkkx,1578929721.0,"Except his comment was as follows.

> 50 year old women pussy smell. Lol. Never.

A) he wasn't saying he wouldn't sleep with her just that he doesn't want a candle that smells like 50 year old woman pussy. I wouldn't want a candle that smells like any pussy.

B) Even if he was commenting on her looks (which he wasn't) turning someone down in a hypothetical doesn't make them an incell. Additionally someone can be beautiful and still have a stinky vagina so I'm still not sure where looks comes into this. 

Just because a human a preference for someone else and find someone that conventional people  consider attractive to not be attractive doesn't mean they're some creepy scumbag who believes women should be subjugated. If Reese Witherspoon asked me to bang her based on her looks alone and I didn't know she was a celebrity I'd turn her down too. She does morning for me. I also find Gwyneth Paltrow to be less than attractive though based on looks alone she isn't a turnoff like Witherspoon is to me. There's nothing wrong with that. Additionally if we based it on personality I would be even less likely to sleep with Paltrow because she's either a totally insane nutball or a schemeing shit person willing to promote damaging and negative products and information for the sake of a buck. 

Once again, all of the above paragraph is moot because nobody other than you brought up anything about anyone's looks.

Honestly if anything someone could call you a neckbeard or an incell as the dude who automatically assumes everyone else is ugly and literally anyone would sleep with Gwyneth Paltrow if given the chance. Just because you would doesn't mean everyone would. Paltrow is far from a 10 in my personal opinion and for all you know OP IS a 10. OP could also be a woman. Giving off some nice guy vibes with the whole ""I'm offended that this person would imply anyone would not sleep with Gwyneth Paltrow."" If Joseph Joestar was here he'd probably say your next line is ""if women like her dated a nice guy they would be worshiped like queens."""
