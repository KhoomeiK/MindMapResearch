Edit: my legitimate answer is believing that Apple is starting to cripple the app to eventually get rid of it"
iphone,femwrv3,t1_femqbhk,1579271640.0,This varies by financial institution. I was able to have my dads Huntington debit and credit card on my phone at the same time as he did.

I was in a thread about somebody that just got a new 16 inch MacBook Pro and someone shared in the comments that they were not necessarily happy with macOS and so they went back to Linux in response to someone saying “once you go Mac you never go back.” and it’s downvoted into oblivion. There was nothing derogatory or mean in the comment about Linux but it was just downvoted into oblivion because they weren’t a Mac user."

college,fem6951,t3_epvag1,1579241229.0,I always get in a group. My friends and I hold each other accountable.

The access key was insanely expensive, the videos were useless at best, and the book never connected to the problem I was working on. Unfortunately, it was the university standard for math 1xx.

iPad Pro comes with a lightning to USBc cord and an 18w adapter.
