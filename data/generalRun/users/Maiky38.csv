nvidia,feq6eb7,t1_feq3x1c,1579338164.0,"I think we are just nitpicking when it comes to what our opinions are. I've been removing heatsinks since the mid 90's because AS5 was always better than the stock paste. When the voodoo cards came out they had horrendous paste jobs from the factory and I was able to decrease temps by 5-6 degrees, back in the day that was a big deal. And to this date I will still remove the cooler and repaste just cause I know I'll get better temps."
nvidia,feq1xzk,t1_feq15ps,1579336318.0,"I never said it was bad, my point is that stock thermal paste is applied inferiorly because it's done by a robot, not all cards get the same amount of paste applied, some have more some have less but the bottom line is the fact that a human can do better than the OEM and if you disagree than that's your opinion."
nvidia,fepv7zn,t1_fenv76d,1579332497.0,Never had a card fail on me with the exception of a BFG GTX 275 back in 2009 when I attempted to replace the paste and to my surprise the dye barely had any paste to begin with. To be honest you are either full of shit or just a newbie tryna be smart.

All he had to do was ignore the stupid Biden investigation and he would be perfectly fine right now. How is it that you are the president and you get to the point that everyone is laughing at you. if you have an ounce of dignity in yourself you would just say sorry I made a mistake but he prefers to drown himself in more culpability.
