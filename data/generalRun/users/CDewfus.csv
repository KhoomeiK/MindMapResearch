So the author is reported to get edgier and edgier, but that scene has stuck with me. It was pretty brutal, even by rape standards. Even as she states that she doesnt want her rapists punished so they can 'do better'. While I can't remember much of the healing process she went through, I note that she kinda... forced(?) herself to have sex with this stranger as a type of bodily acceptance and always through that was strange."

Either walk or get a ride to a source of oil (Gas Station, Auto Parts, Even Dollar Store) Buy like 4 quarts of the *name brand* conventional oil (pennzoil, valvoline, castrol, etc as you shouldnt trust the cheap-o oils that may actually be only compatible with a lawn mower. However, low quality oil is 300% better than no oil) Then add to car, make sure its in the safe zone, and start it up. If the light goes out, good. If now, tow to mechanic. Have them check your oil pressure. 10 psi per 1,000 rpm is the base. A sensor will trigger at \~5 psi. Even then, its not a bad idea to have the pressure measured anyway."
