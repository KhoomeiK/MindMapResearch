lupus,fgnvlxa,t3_ezhp80,1580953866.0,"I am so sorry for your circumstances. I know the pain you are talking about. One dr told me to use visualization and water aerobics. Fortunately I went to another dr who gave me the meds I needed, including Norco. I am not a drug seeker either but some people NEED it. I would
be in bed 24/7 without it. I hope you find someone who will help you. I couldn’t help but to wish my first dr could feel my pain for one day and see how water therapy helped her."

knitting,fg871sc,t3_ex79ip,1580611228.0,"Your feelings are justified. However, I would give her the damn hat just to get her off my back. But that is it. One of my friends paints so beautifully but has made it clear she only paints what she wants when she wants and never for money. So if she gives someone a painting it is super precious. Tell your aunt you no longer knit on demand."
