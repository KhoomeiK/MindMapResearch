CrazyIdeas,ff21eva,t1_felcmu1,1579491207.0,Maybe I’ll message the moderator who banned me and cry about all my bipolar issues since I can’t post it in r/bipolar. Maybe then she’ll get sick of me dumping my problems on her and she’ll let me back in the sub
CrazyIdeas,ff216tb,t1_felcmu1,1579491043.0,"I had a bad day today. I don’t have many friends and my boyfriend is breaking up with me so I don’t know who to talk to now. Bc I can’t post on r/bipolar

I guess I deserve not to have the crucial, literally life saving support of all my other bipolar buddies on reddit because I accidentally broke a rule (although that’s still debatable but whatever). What’s done is done. Sucks to suck. Maybe I’ll kill myself and it won’t matter anymore.

I just had a really shitty day."
CrazyIdeas,ff20nby,t1_felcmu1,1579490652.0,Kill myself. I’m bipolar.

Hahaha if you are really the one who banned this person then... how do I put this nicely so I don’t get banned?.... you need to use your power a little more maturely. Let me explain why you deserve to now be banned (temporarily) for abuse of power.

First off, you just called someone a “bitch” (excuse my vulgar language) right in front of everyone who will read this post. This is in direct violation of the Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities which states that:

1. Healthy communities are those where participants engage in good faith, and with an assumption of good faith for their co-collaborators. **It’s not appropriate to attack your own users.**...

You have just attacked one of our users for stating their opinion on the matter. They did not attack you by calling you names as you have done. They simply stated the facts of what happened (them getting banned for said amount of time) and then expressed their opinion that they didn’t feel they deserved to be banned for that long (and In response, you expressed that you had reduced the ban time, indicating that you also did not agree that this person needed to be banned for that long).

Furthermore, the Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities also states:

8. Healthy communities allow for appropriate discussion (and appeal) of moderator actions. Appeals to your actions should be taken seriously. Moderator responses to appeals by their users should be consistent, germane to the issue raised and ***work through education, not punishment.***

You have responded to this person’s opinion by trying to punish them for it instead of just downvoting it like the rest of us. This demonstrates your abuse of power in this situation; you publicly targeted and shamed someone, and the Content Policy clearly states that bullying will not be tolerated.

I hope you understand that I am trying  to keep the Reddit community safe, so I am going to have to report you and I hope that you are able to learn from this experience so that you do not have to make the same mistakes as a moderator in the future. This is not a punishment. This is a learning experience."
CrazyIdeas,fegplvu,t1_fegpc2g,1579099534.0,Damn. I was permanently banned from r/bipolar a few hours ago like wtf bipolar people are supposed to fuck up anyway so why are they permanently banning me from my only support group? A 30 day ban would do

bipolar,feeerlb,t3_eodofe,1579032255.0,Yes. Take away my hypomania and I’m just depressed and crazy. My hope in life is waiting for each hypomanic episode to come back every couple weeks or months so I can get things done and stop feeling depressed
bipolar,feeebor,t1_fedgiuf,1579031996.0,I agree with him. My hospital stay changed the whole course of my life and I was only there for 7 days

schizophrenia,fdnymno,t3_emabv3,1578595503.0,"I’m not schizophrenic either. I’m type two bipolar and I read this stuff and just think, wow I couldn’t handle these symptoms. It must take a strong person to be able to handle all of that and learn to cope with it."
Psychosis,fdnx88a,t1_fdn9saa,1578594687.0,I did too. And I agree. It was easy to be open there. Like you can’t just walk around the real world talking about your chronic suicidal thoughts or you’ll scare everyone but at the hospital no one is gonna judge and most of them understand firsthand. Like I showed people my scars and saw other people’s scars and heard about their suicide attempts.
Psychosis,fdn99nr,t1_fdn8r1l,1578580678.0,"Me too! I miss the hospital. I even disguised myself with fake tattoos, hair dye and make up so I could get back in during visiting hours to visit a friend who was still there after I got out (they don’t let previous patients visit there).

Now I just do puzzles and stuff because that’s what we did at the hospital and I didn’t have to worry about rent or safety or responsibilities or feeding myself or not being able to sleep (bc they had sleeping pills) or acting normal in front of other people or any other maintenance difficulties of life. I know a lot of people hate on psych wards but I loved it there and it changed my life so I get nostalgic about it."

Psychosis,fdn8h89,t1_fdn7p1f,1578580107.0,"That’s so cool. He sounds awesome.

I made a lot of friends at the hospital too. And yeah the floor below us was the notorious 6th floor where all of the crazy shit went down and if you did anything remotely concerning they would send you down to the 6th floor where there is nothing to do. But on the 7th floor we could color and play cards and do puzzles. I also was dying to have a pen so I could write on myself because my friends and I designed a puzzle piece tattoo with the words “missing pieces” spelled above and below it. I had to be really sneaky stealing it off of the front desk because if I got caught they could send me to the 6th floor. I had to keep it in my bra because they searched our rooms every day. And when that pen ran out I had to switch it with another pen from the desk which was a huge accomplishment bc they are always watching the desk and there are cameras that apparently don’t get checked often.

I have a lot of random stories from the hospital like when I first got there they made me take out my earrings (bc you could hurt yourself with them) which I didn’t wanna do bc my holes close in like a day so I begged them to find me something I could use instead and they didn’t care so at lunch I picked apart an apple stem until there were two perfectly earring-shaped studs with a nub on one end of each so they wouldn’t fall out.... yeah then my ear holes got infected and my nurse found that out and gave me plastic earrings."
Psychosis,fdn70fn,t1_fdn6wai,1578579024.0,"Omg that’s terrifying I’m sorry!

Yeah I didn’t stay on the same floor as the psychosis patients so it was just me and my bipolar peers, some suicidal patients and a PTSD girl"
Psychosis,fdn6mrg,t1_fdn6jw6,1578578728.0,"Oh no...

I stayed in a mental ward for a while as well and people would talk about breaking out but no one ever did it"
Psychosis,fdn59fd,t1_fdj71sh,1578577656.0,"Wow that’s creepy!!!

I’m type two bipolar so I don’t experience symptoms of psychosis (yet) but I am very interested in the topic recently because I’ve been extra paranoid since I ran out of meds and keep thinking there are spiders everywhere or people in the room at night but I know it can’t be and I think it’s more of paranoia rather than a delusion.

It seems like people with paranoid psychosis say what you just said about the hidden messages a lot and I was wondering how that happens. Like what kinds of things do you see on tv or read that you think are a hidden message? And could you maybe give a hypothetical example or something?"
Psychosis,fdn3v21,t1_fdm62dt,1578576509.0,Plenty of people see psychiatrists for lots of things that are less severe so if anyone asks you can just tell them it’s your anxiety. But you don’t have to feel uncomfortable about it because most people will already assume it’s something less severe if they do find out

Thank you so much. I have so much respect for you and the way you wrote that with all of the evidence and research and without bashing on the church. Like I said in my post, I find it to hold more credibility than the CES Letter because of how maturely and unbiasedly it was written. 

If it wasn’t for your letter, I might still be on the fence about the church. I was so unsure of myself and worried that I was making the wrong decision but because of you, I was able to do something more with my life and escape the rough parts of my past."
