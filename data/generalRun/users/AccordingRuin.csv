It's not ""being trans"" that causes depression. It's dysphoria. It's feeling at odds with your own body, unable to just be at home in your skin. The high suicide rate? It's because of unaccepting family, a lack of a social safety net, support of any kind. It's not because of our ""new"" bodies.

Walking up to just anyone you think might be trans and trying to start a debate is *of course* going to have bad results. People just want to live their lives in peace, with the medical assistance they require to be healthy and happy. What's to debate about that?
