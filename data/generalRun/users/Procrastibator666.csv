 Where someone who's fun at parties such as yourself tells Ed that you refute his ""we're all dudes"" comment on behalf of those who don't want to be called dude. Stop taking everything so seriously all the time. It's a good way to end up alone and in an early grave"

mildlyinfuriating,fela3j0,t1_fel8ji8,1579217380.0,This is so sad. There's so much sadness everywhere in this world. This woman's whole life altered because of this. Time is a finite resource. She has one go at this and they just fucked it up.  And what really takes the breath away is to think this is only one instance. They do this to hundreds of thousands of people. I need r/eyebleach or something. I see all this suffering everywhere and almost no way to fix it. The damage is done. The people in power are in place. The money has been hoarded.

And I wasn't snarking on you for his inactions, it was the irony that you use thank God in the same instance as someone being too stupid to not confess their crimes of molestation.

Cause I'll tell you that doesn't represent what's really going on in the country, and where it's going. Ask any economist how long things will sustain this way. The richest 400 families paid less tax than middle class people. 100 of the fortune 500 companies paid zero in Federal tax. Stop agreeing with what these people are saying so you can feel like a part of a club that doesn't give a shit about you. Do your own research. Think for yourself."
