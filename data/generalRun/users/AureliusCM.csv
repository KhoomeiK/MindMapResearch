PublicFreakout,ffqi771,t1_ffpaadn,1580135298.0,That was terrible to watch. Holy fuck.
AskReddit,ffpx17k,t1_ffpmz7e,1580109109.0,"I felt similarly at my first two professional jobs. I stuck with them a while, each for 5 years, but got pretty frustrated by thinking I could do better but not within my middle management ceiling. So, I then joined a startup to run most of it so I could do it my way, and it's a ton of fun! High risk, but really high potential, and it's a blast along the way, at least in my case.

Is it feasible for you to start your own business or to pair up with a connection or two to get it off the ground?"
AskReddit,ffpwrto,t1_ffpkl7r,1580108784.0,"For me, IF was the key, specifically the help page on r/intermittentfasting provided me with some baby steps. It's a super easy way to lower calorie intake without changing **what** you eat, just **when** you eat. The ultimate goal is to only eat during an 8-hour window each day, 12-8pm. And I got there incrementally.

First, I stopped eating after 8pm, then I started eating breakfast no earlier than 10am, then 11am, then it wasn't too hard to just jump straight to lunch starting at noon. I then have an afternoon snack / small meal, and a dinner. My total daily calories are now lower, I don't feel any hungrier, and I've lost weight and still losing some.

I hate diets and calorie counting, so this was an easy alternative."

AskParents,ffpftwa,t1_ffp2grx,1580093996.0,"Glad someone else linked it for you. In an attempt to be constructively critical, the replier said ""Big Brothers and Big Sisters"". You interpreted that as Big Brother, meaning you didn't listen or read it very well. Googling ""Big Brother"" gives you the 1984 reference and a TV show, but try a little more persistence when you have the chance. Just takes a few seconds. If you had googled either ""Big Brothers"" or ""big brother big sister"" then the proper website is the first result.

Schoolwork is very similar. Pay attention and try hard. If you fail, try again. All it takes is paying attention and effort, which will develop your own internal discipline, and you may then find yourself doing a little better. I had to learn that lesson in High School and went from failing several classes to passing them all (one barely) then later on achieved a high GPA. I was also 15 at the time.

However, I reading your other replies, it sounds like you may have some serious mental issues that need to be addressed. Glad you're in therapy. Are you on any medications? Are they helping?"

Most times I've seen it asked on reddit, the consensus is that it's perfectly legal. It is only illegal if it crosses into something like hacking or harassing, which is why it results in a reddit ban.

Follow that and you will get it right 99% of the time. The subtlety is that ""effect"" can sometimes be a verb, but it's very uncommon. ""This post will effect change to the English language.""

Having a kid is a *huge* decision. Think through these things and don't proceed if either of you has doubts. Those doubts may blow up into resentment and discord if left unaddressed.

Most people here are saying they would have rather waited until their late 20s or early 30s. I also had 2 kids in my mid 20s, and looking back, I wish I had waited longer. And, controversially, I kind of wish I never had them.

I didn't consider that the kid(s) would take over *our entire lives*. I had to take a step back in my career to travel less. My spouse and I don't get to go on dates often because we have to hire a babysitter each time. No family nearby. We traveled a lot and went to a lot of comedy and music shows before kids, and we've kind of lost ourselves as our lives now revolve around not fucking them up.
