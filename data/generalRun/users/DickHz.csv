YouShouldKnow,ffktoq5,t1_ffj70h9,1580028677.0,"While it is scary to think about, there are scientists whose jobs is to literally melt down the ice and study these types of viruses and pathogens in labs to get a “head start,” if you will, so that should an outbreak occur, we’ll already have a good understanding of them and hopefully already have vaccines or cures. So don’t fret too much :)"

modernwarfare,fcarclx,t3_eeo372,1577575099.0,PLEASE implement a harsher penalty for leaving matches early. It’s incredibly frustrating that several players would leave and ultimately cost us the game because we’re at a disadvantage. Lack of a harsher penalty discourages any teamwork from occurring online when the going gets tough and is completely unfair for those that stick the matches out.
