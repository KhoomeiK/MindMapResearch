Apparently she must have given birth to another puppy because we found it dead buried in the blankets in said kennel yesterday. So I had to comfort a crying coworker and bag up a tiny pitbull or pit mix baby (Because of course that’s what the mom was) and throw it in the trash, and it sucked. I really hope the owners get her to the vet to make sure she doesn’t have anything else in there. And then hopefully get her spayed though they seemed really blasé about the whole deal.

Like I said in my other comment, I think anxiety medication would be a really good idea for your dog right now especially. Once she’s recovered from surgery you can look into separation anxiety training to work on that issue separately. [Malena Dimartini](https://malenademartini.com/)’s website may be helpful when you’re ready.

I’d also stay in touch with your vet about the healing timeframe. When we had surgery for luxating patella done on a much bigger dog years ago, they did want him to be walking around a little more around 2-3 weeks post op and his comfort with weight bearing would increase as the healing process progressed."

Clean the crate, take the dog out more frequently on a leash and treat her like a tiny baby puppy when she does do her business on a leash and reward heavily. While you can’t play crate games to raise the value of the crate the way you traditionally maybe should have, you can work on crate training a little by sitting near the kennel with the door open and rewarding her for staying in it.

A short, stocky dog with a low center of gravity is better for the original purpose of sitting in a blind or in a boat to retrieve water fowl - when you come to different areas of the US and need to start looking at longer distances, you tend to see taller, rangier dogs as a result. Even in the field line Labs you can see 90 lbs rangy behemoths or 50 lbs pocket rocket dogs. There is also a propensity to have some of the dogs in the show ring be a little (or a lot) overweight to give the illusion of the desired barrel chest if the dog doesn't have a substance yet.

There is a happy medium, which is a moderate Lab. I've seen some hideous field Labs and I've seen ugly fat little cow show dogs, and I've seen nice moderate ones in between.

dogs,fee5it6,t1_fee4tid,1579026825.0,"I’m really curious about the nuance especially for hunting dogs and would love if someone were to take a look at it long-term. I think the hunting community still has a long way to go - I specifically try to not be around on days when a really old school guy who likes to bite his dogs’ ears to assert dominance is there because I have zero tolerance for that shit, especially on a known sensitive breed like this guy has. 😐 I’d also be curious when it comes to hunting with hounds since some of them work a mile away from you, which just gives me heart palpitations conceptually.

Even in person I don’t generally recommend e-collars because I think the behaviors people are trying to remedy are, more often than not, a matter of management, not understanding the root cause of a problem or just poor training in general."
dogs,fee3cgj,t1_fee34v9,1579025540.0,I used to feel bad and like I’d failed in my training with her and then she started stealing it off counters or out of our bag and bringing it to us/throwing it at us. 😅
dogs,fee3788,t1_fee2chl,1579025453.0,"I don’t have access to the journal right now and I agree with you that rewards based training is, nine times out of ten, significantly more effective. Especially for most manners stuff that people try to shortcut by using e-collars.

Were the studies on e-collars all done in the context of modification of problem behaviors or basic obedience? Did they also take a look at working dog contexts like field stuff with bird dogs? Genuinely curious because I think it’s led to a lot more dogs actually coming home from a hunt than they used to when it’s big running dogs, rather than being permanently lost or shot, but I wouldn’t know."
dogs,fee2nkb,t1_fee1o2z,1579025129.0,"I’d give you gold for your thoughtful responses if I didn’t hate giving Reddit money. 😂 This is the more eloquent breakdown of the issue. I used a long line and treats and recall cue layering for months before I introduced the e-collar, and even then relied on classical conditioning to induce a Pavlovian response to the tone in my dog by using it when she was already turning en route back to me during fetch games. It’s an easy thing to have go off the rails and I see dogs at the kennel all the time that were carelessly lit up or put on e-collars too young."
dogs,fee244t,t1_fedzhh7,1579024807.0,"Yeah Saoirse’s response to any novel training object is to slap it or step on it and see how that goes for her. 😂 So I’m not doing nosework on my own ever because I don’t have the energy to deal with it.

Gwen goes “hmmm okay, I can do this, is there food? Okay. I’ll do this. Still not sure. But I’ll try.” Jack just noped out of there and then laid next to the mat and drooled sadly about the kibble he wasn’t getting. Hahaha"
dogs,fee1o14,t3_eooluk,1579024538.0,"Larry Krohn is a pretty harsh “balanced” trainer in my opinion so I’m not keen on him. Michael Ellis is better and has a kinder touch with it.

I don’t believe e-collars are automatically an inhumane tool depending on what it is used for. I use mine to reinforce recall/as a fail safe for a high prey drive dog when out hiking off-leash and for our hunt training. I would never, ever use an e-collar on a dog that was not confident, or fearful, or experiencing generalized anxiety or aggression issues because they do not improve anything in that regard."

Right now Saoirse and I are slogging through the period of overhandling directionals in the field to remind her to actually mind where in the field I am because GSPs generally don’t care thaaaaaat much. Also her off-leash heel is okay and the spousal unit was pretty impressed with her yesterday when we went to the park. She’s only good because she knows I let her go bananas after. 😂"

I'm talking out of two sides of my mouth. I have Alfie, intact and I'm not planning on neutering him anytime soon. OTOH, I have a low opinion of a percentage of pet owners and think that with intact animals they can play all sorts of havoc. Maybe I'm a snob, maybe I'm a total cynic.

No, I think I agree with this. It's hard not to feel like ""oh only I can have intact animals"" (neither of mine are intact, both are ped spays and they're honestly fine, all of our dogs have been pediatrically altered and lived healthy, happy lives - I think some of the anti-spay and neuter rhetoric really blows things out of proportion).

I am around a lot of intact animals these days due to sports and working kennel stuff, and even a lot of those folks I think I'd rather have neuter or spay their animals because they don't go through the necessary steps to breed responsibly or prevent a breeding. Most of the pet owning population just isn't going to be on top of this stuff."
dogs,feaz9yr,t1_feayxb6,1578953802.0,"Leash laws exist to curb irresponsible dog ownership and are a matter of public health and safety in regards to dog bites and zoonotic diseases. This isn't a free-for-all just because you claim it may be ""working for everyone but OP."" You are clearly insane."

dogs,fea61aw,t1_fea35f9,1578944771.0,"I think recognizing your own limitations and staying where it’s fun for you is a really, really healthy thing to do even when impostor syndrome rears its ugly head. Often with dog sports there is also the income and age and experience gap that makes me feel very small.

But it’s okay to be new to stuff, it’s okay to only focus on the things that bring us and our dogs joy. There are a lot of things I maybe want to try but it’s healthier for me to stick with one or two and try to be really good at those within the limitation of my own experience and ability, and whether my dog is enjoying itself. Outside of my dogs I have work (two jobs even), a spouse with a disability, family and friends who aren’t into dogs or are sick, and if I pull myself into too many different directions I just wind up feeling awful for not being perfect at the things I try."
