explainlikeimfive,ff5625e,t3_erpfmy,1579581255.0,"Melting snow can indeed cause flooding, but not that often.  That's because snow generally melts gradually and since the temperature has risen after being to cold to hold much water, the air is pretty dry and the water evaporates pretty quickly.  It helps to understand that snow is a great insulator, so when snow melts, only the surface layer melts and it keeps all the snow under it cold.  If you get enough snow during the winter packed down by the ploughs, it can take weeks during the spring to melt it all.  It will be 70 degrees and there will still be the remains of snow piles because snow is such a good insulator.  


Also keep in mind that water has the unique property of expanding when it freezes, so when it melts, it contracts, turning into less water than the snow it came from. So there isn't nearly as much water from melting snow as you would think there would be.  


Hope that helps."

explainlikeimfive,fezyd76,t3_er0jso,1579463223.0,"Let's compare these processors to cars. First we will take a luxury style SUV. That car is designed to do a little bit of everything.  It's comfortable, it can move decently fast, it can haul trailer, it can carry cargo or passengers.  If you need one thing that can do pretty much everything at the drop of a hat, it's great. CPU as in a computer have to be able to handle a variety of tasks, especially one designed for PCs.  The same processor has to so many different things on a daily basis, that it's more important to be able to do all of them adequately, than to do just one of the superbly and be unable to do anything else.

Back to the car analogy, while your SUV may be decently good at everything, but if you want to race, it's not a great choice.  You need something optimized for speed and pretty much only speed.  Instead, you use a race car.  Race cars are built to do  basically two things: Go really fast and protect the driver in a crash.  Everything else gets sacrificed to do those two things and anything required to do them.  The GPU is the same.  It's optimized to do the intense calculations needed to process graphics on the fly and only that.  It simply can't do any of the many other stuff that a generic CPU needs to be able to do, but a generic CPU simply is too slow at graphics processing to handle any modern graphics or really even most older graphics.

So yeah, both are processors, just like the SUV and the racecar are both cars, but they don't do the same thing and are not interchangeable."

And yes, since Virginia has succeeded, it was no longer a state and no permission was needed, but Lincoln and others in the Union kept insisting that the states could not succeed and therefore Virginia was a state, so they did need there permission.  


Either way someone was conveniently manipulating their opinions to get the outcome they wanted anyway. Ultimate it was probably best to separate them, but it was done in a somewhat shady manner.

EDIT: I mean the last line where OP said they turned off the phone services briefly.  


EDIT 2: OP clarified that it was just in the course of normal work.  I maintain that the way it was worded sounded exactly the way I took it, but miscommunication happens and is not a big deal.  I will leave my original comment as it was, however both to preserve the context of the replies and to not be a jerk by trying to hide my mistakes."

AFAIK, though, dogs don't suffer from the physical issues that humans with Williams Syndrome do, so maybe not quite the same?"
explainlikeimfive,felomid,t3_eptm76,1579227177.0,"Actually, the anti-vax movement started before vaccinations proper. Inoculations were like the beta version of vaccinations and there was a HUGE outcry of suspicous people who thought this would make them sick not better.  In some ways, it was similar to the anti-vaxx movement.  And such movements have continued every since. However, they died down and became almost silence in the wake of years of gradual acceptance and scientific validation.  The modern anti vaxx movement just is the latest and arose because of that totally fake study that gave people that were already anti-vaxx some ""scientific evidence"" to rally behind.  The autism connection was new and was scary enough to along with some convincing sounding yet meaningess arguments to sway a bunch of new people.

As for what drives it, I'd say fear and suspicion.  People don't trust the government or big pharma and are suspicious of things they don't understand while also being afraid of hurting their children."
todayilearned,feljceg,t1_felie1j,1579223565.0,No.  It's a measureable genetic condition.  About 27 genes are just plain missing. There are also various physical problem that come with the condition.  It's isn't just about being nice. That's just the thing that is most noticeable about it.

I have been trained in CPR multiple times over the last two decades and rescue breathing was phased out of normal CPR under most certifications starting about 15 years ago and is now not even taught in CPR courses.  Only professional-level CPR courses teach rescue breathing most of the time.  


And that person is also correct about how often it succeeds.  It's in the single percentiles.  We were taught this in CPR class. even a 5% chance of saving a person's life is worth it, but it's not magic."
