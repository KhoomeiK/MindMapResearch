(https://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-ireland-plant-hardiness-zone-map-celsius.php)  and determine if you are 9 a or 9b or something else.

Then go here to see what flowers grow best in Plant zone 9 (if 10 search instead for zone 10, etc...)

A perennial returns every year and normally does not die out unless stress."
