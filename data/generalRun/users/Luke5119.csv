After the merger with Office Max, things only got worse, same for Max employees adapting to Depot.  As is the case with any failing company, we had constantly changing ""programs"", corporate pushing on overly aggressive selling tactics, everyone is doing the work of 2-3 people, and any employee incentives/benefits that used to be in place are now extinct, and stores closing in droves.

She then interlocks her fingers in mine and just looks at me.  I remember feeling that I knew who she was, and simultaneously wondering what was going on.  She asks me at one point if I loved her, and I just in a panic said yes.  Not a minute or so later, I woke up.

Someone online deepfaked scenes of the film using archive footage from Casino, Heat, Goodfellas, and Cop Land to make them look younger and it looked even more convincing than some of the shots in the movie.  

Something that is often overlooked when they use CGI to make someone look younger is how much the shape of someone's face changes with age.  Your nose gets larger, mouth sinks lower, your upper brow sinks more, so much that is very difficult to adjust to match someone's appearance from 30-40+ years ago."

It's a bit of a long story, so bare with me.

I graduated with a degree in graphic design.  After nearly 10 years of working retail, and just being complacent, I decided to make a change.  I can't take all the credit, it was my girlfriend (now fiancee) who helped challenge and push me to be better.

At the end of 2018 a client of mine reached out to me as she knew I was unhappy at my job.  She hired me on and I started 2019 with a new job, got a slight bump in pay, and was MUCH happier.  I was doing 1/4 the work I used to do, and was loving every minute of it.  Well I decided to make 2019 my bitch and made a lot of huge moves.

- I totally restructured my entire diet and started eating healthier.  No more alcohol, caffeine, or soda.

- I adopted a rigorous exercise regimen and now workout 6 days a week (60-90 mins. each day).

- I proposed to my longtime girlfriend while on vacation, she said yes!

- I rebuilt my résumé and portfolio from the ground up and had friends in the industry proof it and get it in the right hands to hopefully get an interview.

- I had 2 interviews with very reputable companies, both of which turned me down.  It was tough, but I treated it as a learning experience.

- I got a random callback from another company mid December.  After 3 interviews and a meet and greet, I got the job!  My official hire date was Dec. 31st

- I'm now sitting in a hotel room in New York, and tomorrow morning I start my two weeks of training.  

I never would have thought in a million years that I had it in me to be sitting where I am now, but I did it.  There is no doubt jumping out into the unknown is scary, but its very important that you do it.  Because it means the difference between waking up one day and saying ""I did it"" and waking up one day and saying ""Why didn't I ?""."

I was pitching and took a line drive to the face.  I was wearing sunglasses and the impact of the ball shoved the frames into my face.  Thankfully the lens didn't break in my eye and just popped out.  But the frames caused a massive laceration around my left eye.  I started bleeding profusely and had to be rushed to the hospital.  After several hours of scans and 24 stitches, I was discharged.  I was lucky to avoid any bad scarring, doc did a good job sewing me up.  The most painful part of the whole thing was getting the shots to numb the area before getting stitched.  Got 6 shots in total and they went in so deep I felt them scrape my orbital bone, yeah....that hurt a bit."

Ran into him not a year ago and it was without a doubt one of the most awkward interactions I've ever had in my life.  Fewer relationships are better left forgotten than the former brother in law who's fucked in the head."

The hardest reality to face was when I hit my mid 20's, I just didn't have the time to game anymore.  I have a PS4, PS3, Wii, and Switch all literally collecting dust.  Wife and I got the Switch and played it all of a few months, although she's counting the days to the release of the new Animal Crossing.  She'll be getting more use out of that system than I will.

It sucks, but it's part of growing up I guess.  I know the PS5 and the new XBox are on the verge of release Fall of this year, but this may be the first new gen system I won't be buying.  

I'll be turning 30 this year, and I think I'll be ""hanging up"" my controller if you will.  I went back to COD at a friends house this summer, and got my ass handed to me online.

Former UPS Store employee, which are independently owned and operated, UPS just pays branding rights more or less.

They make only $5 per box of Amazon returns.  Each Box contains anywhere from 25-35+ items.  An average store will fill between 120-150+ boxes a month, netting $750 of profit, sometimes more.  But said stores will invest 115+ hours a month just on assisting with Amazon returns.  No profit is made until a box is full and labeled.  Owners also have to pay for the supplies and aren't reimbursed by Amazon.

If you do the math, Amazon as a whole is only compensating an entire store roughly $6.50 an hour for their time asssisting with returning their product.

FedEx has already fired them, UPS will likely do the same.  I give it less than a few years and Amazon will have dedicated return kiosks setup just to take all their returns.  Their running out of options to whore out their returns too."

Say you do well all throughout school, at some point your education will only carry you so far before other variables come into play.  Grants, scholarships, SAT scores, what university you attend, how well do you network?

At some point the majority of us are all sitting at a table or on a phone call opposite someone who ultimately decides what doors open for us, or remain closed and locked.  

When you're someone ""from means"" or if you're born into wealth, most of those doors while closed are almost all unlocked.  And your ""networking"" consists or mom, dad, a close relative, or family friend vouching for you and opening that door on your behalf."
