She stood tall and walked out, thinking she could very well go to jail but also knowing that her name would likely be in the papers for ignominious reasons.

This happened in Kansas City in, probably, 2012 or so. It was a big story for a bit. [From what i can find, the total nudged up to around $200K or so.](https://www.today.com/news/man-who-returned-ring-no-longer-homeless-i-feel-human-8C11044196) The twist here is that the couple that started this with Billy Ray stayed involved in his life — at least for a while from what I can tell. Aside from taking the time to set up the fund and giving him some money, they lent their time and support to him, helping him to better navigate his transition to homed life. 

So yeah, a great swath of the homeless aren’t saints. But this guy did a good thing and fate put him in touch with some good people who seemed committed (again, from what I can find). That made a huge difference in this case. It certainly was unusual circumstances but it’s nice to see things work out."

cursedcomments,fcnlgi7,t1_fcnb2fj,1577813783.0,"My bad experience was more about my fellow flyers than the plane. The seats were uncomfortable, for sure. But it was like adult spring break. One drunk guy was legit yelling at his buddy 15 rows ahead of him, “TRAVIS!! TRAVIS!! FIREBALL!!” And then he’d slam a little travel bottle of Fireball. He probably had 8 of them on a barely 3 hour flight — and he was drunk when he got on the plane. We still yell “TRAVIS” at each other at random times just for fun. Another guy — an adult human man of who’d see some 40 summers — had the Georgia Tech logo shaved into one side of his head and “Ramblin’ Wreck” in the other and was passed out ahead of takeoff. Then he passed out in the bathroom and had to be extricated very final descent. People we wandering up and down the aisles drinking and buying more, talking to the flight staff, pulling their luggage down. It was hilariously off the rails. My beef with Spirit is that you could tell by the way they handled all of these things (and several others) with a detachment that indicated experience — that this was simply *de rigueur*, like “another one of these.” There didn’t seem to be any thought to, you know, limiting or discouraging any of this. 

Nobody has ever accused me of having a pole up my ass, but it was one of the most unbelievable things I’ve ever seen in a plane — and I’ve flown Copa."
