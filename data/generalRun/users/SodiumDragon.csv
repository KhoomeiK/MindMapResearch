fatlogic,ff2zylk,t1_ff2ztp0,1579529932.0,I think they confuse the feeling of jealousy with being offended sometimes so they say it’s offensive. Noticed a lot of FA posts about weightloss do come across as them just being jealous for other people’s success so they just want to put people down.
fatlogic,ff2zngm,t3_erc58w,1579529672.0,Obesity is already normalised. Vanity sizing in the uk for example I should be size 10 but the changes they’ve made makes me a size 6-8!!

fatlogic,fex0hel,t3_eqob2b,1579422320.0,This sounds more like they had a tantrum because they know they should exercise but they don’t want to. So they threw toys out of the prank and declared exercise triggering.
fatlogic,feptnpi,t3_eq5xqr,1579330890.0,I feel like a lot of FAs can’t see past their own experiences and can’t comprehend that some people can succeed. They failed so everyone else must also fail.

Portion of instant mash 125
Fajita seasoning 20 cal ?

Rubbed some seasoning on the chicken and threw some on the vegetables (I put a bit in the instant mash too)

Chucked it on a baking tray and in the oven for 35 minutes and left it in the oven while I made my mash.

I feel amazing especially since this time last year I couldn’t even run for a bus without gasping for air. I’m also 2 weeks of none smoking and I can smell everything and I feel like I’m growing extra lungs or something. I also ran my first 20km last week and I didn’t even feel the burn. I absolutely love endurance running every time I finish a run I feel so accomplished and I’m so surprised by myself that I’ve finished it. I’ve entered a race in March for epilepsy and I’m so hyped for it. I never knew that losing weight and exercising would give me a hobby that I also love! 

Rant: my goal weight is 55kg but work people are saying I’m too skinny so I’ve actually started saying I’m at maintenance and that I’m 60kg... I wish I didn’t lie but I feel like it’s the only way to keep people off my back."
