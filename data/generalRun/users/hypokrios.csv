I'll repeat myself too, stating that yes, they indeed do all of that, but that is outside the scope and beside the context of OP's statements about the bizarre becoming normal, with an analogy to biological changes. I am no more wilfully ignorant than you are capable of understanding context.

I don't like being wrong, but that doesn't affect me much, as I can change my opinions to the right ones quite effortlessly. I don't claim omniscience.

Me passing judgement on people using 'planes' as an argument here is me just stating objective truths. 

Equipment is not a change to our biology. Biological adaptations have completely different scales and scopes. Every piece of gear used by humans is either a barrier between our anatomy and the surrounding conditions or an object used to access methods not available to a naked human. They're tools. Not the scope of OP's statements at all."
