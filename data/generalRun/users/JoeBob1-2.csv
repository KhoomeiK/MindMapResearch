> I think what a lot of people are forgetting is no-one here is gonna be just off camera, the cordon would be way back from a possible bomb. As soon as they saw a dude on a bike go up to the bag, they started sprinting towards him to stop him.

> The bike covered the distance in enough time that he was able to empty the bag. He only just finished before they reached him - their momentum and focus on neutralising the threat would have made it hard to slow down anyway.

> This happened in adrenaline fueled seconds, where they had to make a quick decision because lives might be at risk or he might be the one who planted it there. You can say ""it was an empty bag, they didn't need to tackle him"" but equally if it was a bomb and it exploded, and they hadn't tried to stop him, people would bitch ""The police did nothing, they stood there and watched him detonate it"".

> End of the day, angry man who could have probably gone another way round fucked with what could have been a bomb, endangering not only his own life but those around him, and some officers ran towards where they could have been killed to protect people."

Guess what? Most of the people living in Africa didn’t have access to guns, and like you said, most of the entire continent was divided. No real military resistance could be made.

Also, you mention that Sub-Saharan Africa hasn’t had many kingdoms. Let me list a few for you:


The Sahelian kingdoms


The Nok Civilization, which is often considered to be one of the most advanced ancient sub-Saharan civilizations in African history

The Nri Kingdom

The Oyo Empire

The Benin Empire

The Kaabu Empire

The Aro Confederacy

The Bonomans

The Ashanti Empire

The Kong Empire

The Kongo Kingdom

The Lunda Empire

The Zulu Kingdom

And many more. Go and do some research on what people in Africa have done. You’ll be surprised"
