depression,ffhn6jp,t1_fffvd1z,1579943425.0,"Totally agree having a creative outlet helps a lot. I have some projects on the go and although I am incredibly frustrated at how little I can achieve, it does help to have something to work towards."
depression,ffhn0u5,t1_ffhhsyz,1579943186.0,"Yep, I feel the same. I keep imagining having a breakdown, undoing all the progress and having to go through awful health assessments for benefits again :("
depression,fffa8sw,t1_fff6svo,1579879503.0,"Thanks, I feel like even that would be overwhelming at the moment. Maybe one day. All the best to you too. You are doing great."
AmItheAsshole,ffeytwe,t3_eszvls,1579870746.0,"YTA. Would you be satisfied if someone gave you that to eat as a main meal, while you watched everyone else eat something filling plus dessert? 
Next time just Google 'simple vegan meal' if you are not feeling bothered to make something fancy like you did for your other guests. At least then they might get an actual meal."
NotionSo,fexfehb,t3_eqrs5v,1579430104.0,"I understand if you want to keep everything in Notion, but I highly recommend trying the Splitwise app. It calculates split finances very easily and it can send reminders to people about money owed."
depression,fexezeb,t1_fexdnvg,1579429906.0,"I think you hit on a major factor - setting goals and getting a sense of accomplishment. I think this helps a lot! Personally, making progress in anything helps me to feel better, and it is just more difficult for some people to make progress with physical exercise. But they might find accomplishment in working on other things."
AmItheAsshole,fexcu13,t1_fesizk4,1579428814.0,"Picking up and returning a scared lost animal is potentially dangerous imo, and although it is the right thing to do, nobody is obliged to do it. The owners should be happy to pay anyone to do this for them if they care about their pet. OP is NTA"
getdisciplined,feqdvcu,t3_eqbz1v,1579340634.0,"Why are you studying if you dont enjoy it? Do you have some goals you are trying to achieve? Will the studying improve your life in the long run? Maybe if you are clear with yourself about the reasons for every task, it will be easier to stick with them. If you dont have a good reason to do the tasks maybe dont do them?

It gets complicated if you have depression for example, because it might feel like there is no point to any goals or tasks. But I think even in that situation there are things you want or don't want for yourself, and those can be the motivation for tasks. You might just have to adjust the tasks to suit your needs."
AmItheAsshole,feq8kzt,t1_fentbxz,1579338881.0,People can be passionate whilst also being professional. Their behaviour sounds terrible. You are NTA.
AmItheAsshole,fe2lttr,t3_enm4dc,1578840182.0,"I say NTA because I understand, but the way you handled it probably is not received well by racists and you will be seen by them as TA so your approach is not an effective one. You can see by the replies on this thread, people who dont experience racism wont get it. Maybe asking why she was acting weird might have led to a productive conversation but tbh I wouldn't waste time on people like that."
TooAfraidToAsk,fe2jc70,t3_enmmau,1578839053.0,"Maybe personal spiritual experience is just that powerful. And if a religious doctrine gives you meaning to be alive, in the face of great oppression, maybe that is enough reason to overlook the negatives. It is probably why so many people are religious, whether their beliefs are logical or not."
TooAfraidToAsk,fe2ir2q,t1_fe2bs1p,1578838802.0,It is interesting because I'm pretty sure Islamic nations were a colonial force within Africa as well
productivity,fe2hvwg,t3_enmwto,1578838474.0,"Maybe this is not the ideal way for you to learn at the moment? Could there be different ways to inspire or trigger action throughout the day? 

Maybe your notes could be more accessible or easier to consume. Do you have specific feelings or reasoning associated with not going over your notes, or do you just forget to look? The solution will probably come from analysing what is preventing you from doing it."
UrbanHell,fe2f5wk,t3_en7rgc,1578837720.0,"Was this made to look like it is different buildings compiled, or has it (somehow) been decorated to look that way?"
AmItheAsshole,fe1vqt6,t3_en90gx,1578831450.0,"NTA. You are correct to not support people who could potentially lead to even more LGBTQ+ people being hurt. Your family needs to be clear that this is the reason for your decision.

It sounds like there is not enough communication happening in this family, very likely because of the religious shame that you would be reinforcing by keeping things quiet.

If you feel like you cannot discuss what really happened to your brother, you are still entitled to say that you do not support homophobia but are open to having a discussion about how to move forward with your family.

SIL has gone through a lot but needs to break the cycle. It is really on her to talk to her child, and probably have some non religious therapy."
AmItheAsshole,fdr7nty,t1_fdr5yew,1578680641.0,"I'm not sure exactly what your point is, but in relation to op, if someone is in a changing room or some other vulnerable position it is very creepy for people to be staring. Creepy behaviour escalates real fast when creeps feel brave. 

I've had people check me out, and then proceed to shout at me, follow me, touch me... sometimes if you're brave enough to speak out against it and reject them, it leads to violence. When nobody else reacts you start to think you have to accept it. 

Everyone has a right to not get involved of course, but I think in the case of the guy very obviously acting in a way that seems creepy to outsiders, it is nice that someone gave a crap."
todayilearned,fdq1vvg,t3_emexbw,1578650770.0,"If you are committed you will use it that much, and a cotton bag can be repaired. When it is no longer repairable, it will decompose as all fabric does.

It would not be environmentally friendly if you kept buying cotton bags but if everyone just had a few over their lifetime it is an awesome alternative to plastic bags. 

Plastic bags would only be equally eco friendly if you would use the same bag for years but I dont think you would unless it is some kind of synthetic fabric"
productivity,fdq19kb,t1_fdpyky6,1578649878.0,"Thanks, using reference material makes sense. I guess I was struggling to imagine how a person remembers the details without visualising but thinking with words works for this. It is really interesting to think about!

I am wondering if I have a form of aphantasia because I can visualise most things, but I struggle with faces. I can draw imaginary faces because i know what proportions of a face look like and i have practiced a lot, but drawing a face from memory would be difficult. I'd be interested to hear if this is common with faces and if there are ways to improve the ability to visualise faces"
AmItheAsshole,fdq0xam,t1_fdopgta,1578649390.0,"As someone that has been harassed and molested by strange men in public many times, without anyone intervening, we should definitely applaud and support anyone that stands up to the creeps. We shouldn't make them feel stupid for defending others."
NotionSo,fdpyfp3,t3_emgqs2,1578645940.0,"I was thinking of doing this too, I have collected a decent amount of annoyances in my notes. 

I wonder if there is a way for multiple users to create a voting system for Notion issues. Notion team has their private one and update it when people mention issues but it seems an inefficient way to do it.

When I was using Fairphone, I was able to become a member and update, vote and comment on issues that need resolving. Mods would update and prioritise tasks based on direct customer feedback on their development site. Seemed like a good system. Maybe can be recreated within Notion?"
productivity,fdpxwbr,t1_fdp4nur,1578645213.0,"I always wanted to know, if you have aphantasia how do you draw pictures? For me I visualise what I want to draw and then I can recreate it. I once asked a youtuber with aphantasia this because she is also an artist, but i never got an answer. Super curious how this works!"
AmItheAsshole,fdmr9fd,t1_fdm3d2j,1578561849.0,I am so curious as to whether the cashier says that to all non aboriginal customers or just hates black people
