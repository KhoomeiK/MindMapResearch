Antipsychiatry,ff61d57,t3_ernw79,1579616633.0,"i agree. almost all of what we call â€œmental illnessâ€ is a reaction to poor social conditions. labeling it an â€œillnessâ€ or a â€œdisorderâ€ puts the blame and responsibility back on the victim, and therefore upholds the status quo. we canâ€™t erase the stigma around â€œmental illnessâ€ because the stigma is the point."

pagan,fevovef,t1_fev511y,1579399779.0,"what a stupid thing to say. some people worship many gods including satan. just because satan is literally demonized by people of abrahamic faiths doesnâ€™t mean heâ€™s â€œabrahamicâ€. satan is a god separate from yahweh. beâ€™elzebul, who has been identified with  the ancient canaanite god baâ€™al or baâ€™al hadad, was also mentioned in the bible, his followers were by no means â€œabrahamicâ€. the irony here is that people like you seem to be against satan worshippers being in the pagan community bc you let christianity trick you into thinking ill of satan, which means on some level that YOU believe lin christianity."

WitchesVsPatriarchy,fc74h1d,t1_fc5gdxv,1577497286.0,"  I asked through pendulum if I had a â€œtwin flameâ€ not expecting to get yes as an answer, but did. I was confused but didnâ€™t think that much of it for a little while. 
  Then eventually I had a thought about this man Iâ€™ve known since we were children. It always bothered me that I had dreams about him so consistently throughout my life. 
  So I asked my gods to send me a sign about him, the sign sent to me was a sighting of a woman I knew who used to be my friend (who i donâ€™t talk to anymore and almost never see in public) who has the same birthday as me (my â€œtwinâ€). I asked through pendulum if that was the sign and got â€œyesâ€."
