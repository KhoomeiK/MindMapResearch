 >”What were you doing charging in like that?  You reckless idiot.”

Applies to Taylor. Also herself, at least when people she cares about are in danger.

 >“You triggered because mommy and daddy didn’t love you because you were normal, then proceeded to show you were the last person who ever deserved powers, maiming people and using your sister to dodge the consequences when you hit them a little too hard.”

Guilty about Amy, much? And don’t forget that Tattletale triggered because her parents blamed her for Rex’s suicide.

Parahumans,fekfgjl,t1_fei554i,1579198933.0,"Honestly, this is true about Worm too. It’s why I have such a hard time getting my friends to read past Gestation, because they’re stuck in Taylor’s head the whole time and don’t get to see her interact with anyone.

Taylor is great, obviously. She’s still my favourite WB protagonist, but she is admittedly kind of generic and uninteresting at the beginning of the story. Everybody’s seen the “bullied teen gets superpowers” storyline before, so people make assumptions. _I_ made assumptions when I started reading, and I very nearly stopped. It’s the circumstances that Taylor is placed in, the characters she interacts with, and how she changes in response to the pressure of those factors that make her story interesting.

Side-note: In general, I think that WB’s writing is at it’s best when he’s writing groups. He has a talent for writing banter and character interactions, and that keeps people reading even when there’s not much actually happening plot-wise. This is honestly why I’ve had such a hard time getting into Pact, because there’s no group to provide banter or comedic relief, and reading it just grinds me down. When things got bad in Worm and Ward, there was always the promise that things would return to a relatively-happy status quo and a few moments of calm to relieve tension, and that was what kept me reading. Pact just... doesn’t have that. I am really enjoying Twig though."

 >Worm is not an interrogation of Superhero genre conventions – quite the opposite. It wholeheartedly _embraces_ every convention within its arms' reach, and where those conventions are sickly it tries to make them well. It doesn't wholly succeed, it knew from the start that it _couldn't_ wholly succeed, but it tries.

 >Worm is a work that takes beloved-but-ridiculous things like star-spangled Superheroes punching swastika-sporting Supervillains, and giant kaiju battles where the good guys and the bad guys cooperate to save the city, and Bond Villains with hundred-step plans and elaborate underground bases, and tries to craft a world where all those things make sense. Where it's not completely absurd that, even though people can fly at supersonic speeds and vaporize buildings by staring at them, the Joker has somehow survived for decades and is somehow a terrifying threat. A world where villains can rob banks and heroines can date villainesses and a giant Mecha-Dragon can get suplexed by Godzilla and all those things make, if not perfect sense, at least _as much sense as they possibly can make_."

I was thinking there would be different types of monsters for different areas of study. You would unlock more types by hiring new professors and offering new classes to students. The most basic types would be resurrected stitched, moving up to living stitched(like the chimera in 3.1) and eventually vat-grown monsters with mechanical augmentations. I am imagining something like Spore, but this would all need to work with 2-D top-down art. Not impossible, but less opportunity for variation as everything would need to be hand-drawn rather than computer generated. You could still swap out limbs and heads and stuff, but idk beyond that. (And of course, other fields of study would include viruses and parasites and swarms and such, which would require their own separate containment methods for if they got loose.) I was also thinking there could be some pre-set monsters for the most dangerous projects, that you could maybe turn into your own personal guards if they were completed.
