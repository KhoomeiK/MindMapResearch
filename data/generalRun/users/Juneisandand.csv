Browns,ffgcidl,t1_ffg7wpu,1579903200.0,What are you talking about? The last 5 Heisman winners alone are all great players. There are a few questionable but really most of them in the past decade produced pretty well in the NFL.

Browns,fffbp3w,t1_ffeh4zr,1579880431.0,I was saying Lamar is better than we give him credit for. It's not like he was some no name who was turned into some great QB.  He won the Heisman for crying out loud.

college,ff292ov,t3_er72ir,1579497404.0,"Yes, but for different reasons. While in high school I always had the thought things would get better. Now I'm in college and shit never got better and now I start to think things will always be the same. Basically just confirmed my suspicions."
