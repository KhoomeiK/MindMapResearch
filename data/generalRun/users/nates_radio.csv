The housing market is very different today than it was back then. In the mid 2000s, prices were being driven up by speculation and home flippers. Today there is actual demand, a robust economic climate and people are moving into the area. You can continue to rent or wait for a better deal or another housing crisis if you honestly think that it’s coming, but I wouldn’t be surprised if 5 or 10 years from now prices have just continued to steadily climb. It’s just supply and demand."

AliceInChains,fb8b8k4,t3_ec04h2,1576610151.0,Way earlier that 98/99. I think Laynes hair was short in those years. Probably more like 89/90.
