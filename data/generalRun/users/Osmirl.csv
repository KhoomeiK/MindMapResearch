thanosdidnothingwrong,fdxctze,t1_fdx96b3,1578767510.0,Yes this is 100% true. The only reason they shot it down was because of the increased alarm situation. They expect American bombers anytime. And this was close to a military base.

Then looked out of their window they expect to see stars but in fact they just saw white everything was glowing.

SweatyPalms,fcz3bcd,t1_fcxh681,1578092809.0,"My first night dive was my lile 20th dive total. Also it wasn’t my usual buddy. Still a verry experience diver but a little old.
I had a similar problem but mine was that i was starting to pop up. As soon as i realize this(wich took some time) i pullt the emergency air vent on my jacket( i was going up feet first so all the air was trapped at my back) 
Meanwhile my buddy had problems himself because his jacket had a hole and he keeps lossing air.
And after he saw me in a bunch of bubbles he pulled me up. Wich of course confused me even more. Took me a few seconds to realize. After we resurfaced we both tried to find out what just happened. We really weren’t that long under water only like 5-6 minutes and only 6 meters deep."
