People think you should carry in case you're being robbed or in a confrontation or something, but that doesn't make any sense to me. Carrying a firearm is a *defensive* measure, not offensive. The only legal justification to even draw it would be if someone else draws a firearm on you first. That's the problem, though - if they drew first, you've already lost and that's the only legal and proper way to ever draw your weapon. 

You know what happens if someone robs you at gunpoint while you're carrying? They're just going to steal your firearm AND your wallet because you couldn't draw first OR the presence of another firearm is going to increase your odds of being shot in the robbery. I don't see a positive at all.

The ONLY situation I can even think of where conceal carry would help at all would be if you're a bystander in a mass shooting. If you're able to get to cover and confront the target, you could possibly take him down. But in the heat of the moment, are you considering your surroundings? What's BEHIND your target? I don't know if I could live with myself if I took down a shooter, but killed someone else with a stray bullet."

The incumbent president would have won re-election, whether Democratic or Republican, because of the nationalistic fervor post-9/11; that election had very little to do with actual policy. Also, we don't know if 9/11 would've also occurred under a Gore administration.

Without the antiquated Electoral College, we would've had a solid block of Democratic presidents (Clinton, Gore, Obama, Clinton) in response to the prior block of Republican presidents (Nixon, Ford, Reagan, Bush with a brief Carter respite).

With Democrats more confident in their electoral victories, candidates could've been more likely to shift further to the left without the need to appease indecisive moderates and the past three decades in American history could've seen unprecedented economic growth, a decline in income inequality, the return of unions and workers' rights, rising education standards, and groundbreaking environmental regulations that all cement our place as a world leader in the modern age.

DestinyTheGame,fczza8m,t1_fcz91qy,1578111209.0,"I just hate that there isn't a clear, coherent path to max light. I've done every pinnacle activity every week since the beginning of the season, including raid challenges. All 3 of my characters are stuck at 969.

What's the difference between me and someone currently at 970? Luck, that's it. 12 of their 15 weekly pinnacles from the raid were armor while 14 of mine were energy weapons.

I'm not opposed to randomness in loot drops, but right now it's theoretically possible for someone to never hit 970 this season if their luck is bad enough, even if they do every single pinnacle.

Aside from that, the insane RNG in getting well-rolled armor is ridiculous and it's even more ridiculous if you want to look a certain way. I used to have a distinct look that used several Reverie Dawn pieces on each character. I loved it. Now I'm limited to using like 3 armor sets to craft my look because the chances of getting high stat Reverie Dawn gear is abysmal, let alone also getting the correct element and stat distribution. Don't even get me started on trying to get an exotic that fits those parameters as well.

There are currently WAY too many layers of RNG in armor 2.0. I LOVE the idea of armor 2.0, but the current implementation is too reliant on unchangeable RNG. RNG should be a shortcut to good armor - get a good roll on a drop and you're set - but you should also have a clear grind to IMPROVING your perfect piece of armor.

Seriously, give us a way to change the elemental affinity, but only twice so you have to pick an element, you can't just continually cycle. And then give us a way to change stat distributions and to add stat points up to a certain level. Make it a grind and let RNG be the shortcut."

IAmA,fcoeann,t1_fcnz3tb,1577830143.0,I'm so sorry to hear that. Thank you for the kind words and I hope for the best for you and your sister. I'm keenly aware that addiction unfortunately affects more people than just the addict.
IAmA,fcoe3at,t1_fco680v,1577829998.0,"I'm gonna agree with the other guy who responded to your comment and implore you to get medical attention. If you want the best possible chance of successfully getting off and staying off opioids, you should strongly consider Suboxone treatment. If you're struggling with detox, there are detox centers that will start you on an initial few doses of Suboxone and recommend you to a psychiatrist to continue treatment.

Suboxone is part of medication-assisted treatment (MAT), which is a combination of Suboxone administered by a psychiatrist and therapy/support. I went through several rehabs and was forcefully detoxed in several jails and I never stayed clean for more than a month until I made use of MAT. I was prescribed Suboxone during detox, was kept on it throughout a 30 day inpatient rehab, and then had to attend 90 days of intensive outpatient therapy plus monthly one on one therapy in order to stay on my Suboxone. I attended NA as well multiple nights a week for almost 2 years.

The decision to begin MAT is a discussion between you and doctor, period. I'm only trying to make you aware of it, but know that you can get clean any way that works for you and I wish you all the strength I can. If you need someone to talk to, feel free to message me."

IAmA,fcnluo8,t1_fcneiny,1577813974.0,"Lots of reasons, some known at the time and some unknown. 

I lost my dad to suicide when I was young and did a lot of drugs as a teenager to cope with it. I was vehemently anti-drug for a long time thanks to DARE and then tried weed one day, realized I wasn't going to die like DARE said I would, and wondered what else they lied to me about. 

I took a lot of advanced classes and did drugs to cope with the increased academic pressure and the unresolved emotional issues from losing my dad and because they were fun. I gained a reputation in school as the crazy guy who had great grades, but would also massively overdo the drug usage. I decided I wanted to try everything at least once and by the time I graduated high school, I had tried every common drug at least once.

I had done a lot of opioids, but I tried to avoid doing them often because I knew how much I liked them. My dad had been hopelessly addicted to prescribed opioids for his rare spine disease and I knew I'd likely share the same propensity. Just before I graduated high school, I injected heroin for the first time and immediately vowed to stayed away from it because it was the best thing I'd ever experienced.

I went to college for physics, made it through a couple semesters still doing random drugs recreationally. I was always broke and someone back home offered me a chance to sell some weed to make some extra money, so I took him up on the offer. A friend of mine narced on me and I was arrested the week before finals and charged with two felonies. I was in jail during finals, so I flunked every class and my college expelled me. I was sent back to my hometown to work minimum wage jobs on felony supervised probation because I had sold my friend 4 grams of weed.

At that point, I just said fuck it. Some old friends of mine were seeing a dirty doctor and getting thousands of oxycontin pills per week for pennies and they let me have as many as I wanted. So for months I just injected as many oxys as I possibly could every day. Then the doctor got busted, all the pills dried up, and I was dopesick. 

One of my old friends said the pills were gone and weren't coming back, but he had some heroin and it would make me feel better. He gave me a bag for free and that was it. I spent the next 5 years of my life exclusively chasing and doing heroin. I didn't want anything else."
IAmA,fcnafum,t1_fcn9567,1577807355.0,"The cravings never stop. Ever.

They may occur less frequently or they may be less intense, but they never stop. I've been clean for 4 years and I still have cravings and I still have dreams of using.

And scaring a heroin addict straight isn't easy to do. I OD'd several times and the first thing I did after leaving the hospital every time was go get high.

Addiction is a disease that affects your decision-making processes, things most of us take for granted like the ability to assess risk vs reward and make a logical decision. Addiction massively distorts and impairs that process."

If you're driving around with your buddy and your buddy has several felony warrants he didn't tell you about and you're pulled over for a broken tail-light and they run his license, you're getting torn out of your car at gunpoint and every part of your car is getting searched, with or without your consent.

I've been on unsupervised and supervised probations and I've had to list an address for when I got out of prison.

For unsupervised probation, I had to list my address, but no one checked on anything. Unsure if the police were able to search it without a warrant.

For supervised probation, I had to list my address and my PO conducted a drive-by verification - basically just ensuring that it was a legitimate residence. She was also able to go up and knock and talk to anyone inside, but she didn't feel like she had to. The police absolutely could show up and search it at any time if they felt they needed to, however.

When I was close to being released from prison, I had to list an address in my post-release plan. That address WAS verified by an officer showing up, knocking, talking to anyone who lived there, and searching it. The police absolutely could show up and search it any time for the remainder of my probation/parole. If you didn't have an address to list or if your address was deemed unacceptable, you would be assigned a halfway house to be released to.

These were all the result of various municipal and state charges, though, and the laws and regulations surrounding all of this are different for each state and for federal crimes."
