askscience,ffhhnl2,t1_ffhf3s1,1579935662.0,You think the government quarantined more than 30M people because of a thousand?
askscience,ffhhfj4,t1_ffhgtl8,1579935378.0,"Not really, proofreading has a specific definition"
Amd,ffhgb8q,t1_ffhg3k4,1579934013.0,Apologies I couldn't remember what mine was called
askscience,ffhftd7,t1_ffha9mb,1579933433.0,I would hard pass coronavirus or not
askscience,ffhfl52,t1_ffhayfu,1579933169.0,There's one in the guardian describing this as well FYI if you were looking for other articles.

askscience,ffhfevn,t1_ffhaafd,1579932967.0,They confirm the diagnoses with biochemical tests.
askscience,ffhfdbq,t1_ffhatmg,1579932917.0,But if it wasn't a real threat what would they have to quarantine? They would need a pretty damn good reason to believe it is worth all the trouble.
askscience,ffhfbq6,t1_ffha9ls,1579932864.0,"Well fortunately for us, that would likely also correspond with a decrease in mortality rate (though maybe not from the official numbers if the government is underreporting those as well). For now given the official numbers it does not seem to be as deadly as SARS for example."
askscience,ffhf1ro,t1_ffh8qkb,1579932543.0,I mean the government is literally destroying roads to stop people from leaving quarantined areas...
askscience,ffhf0bt,t1_ffha489,1579932499.0,"Yeah. You could respond to hundreds of ""false alarms"" before the cost-benefit even started to approach that of a real pandemic."
askscience,ffhexm1,t1_ffgz9j5,1579932416.0,"> a few hundred sick.

Damn what a feeling. Still waiting for that one myself."
Amd,ffhe53a,t1_ffg69nl,1579931557.0,It's really not though. 40-60 degrees idle is pretty unacceptable imo.
Amd,ffhe32p,t1_ffgdpsl,1579931496.0,Are they though? My 3600x idles at 50 C... about time to install my h100i

dogs,ffge7ru,t1_ffg7wi6,1579904260.0,I wasn't implying you did something wrong? Lol. I was merely asking if that's what you're supposed to do for my own knowledge.
dogs,ffg5vfw,t3_etd5f7,1579899117.0,If you're walking your dog on a leash and unleashed dogs run at you should you drop the leash ?
