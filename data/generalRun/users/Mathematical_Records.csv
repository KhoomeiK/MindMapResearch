gaming,ffol5j6,t1_ffnx883,1580078817.0,I came from Dark Souls 3. Couldn't play more than 5 minutes of that clunky Witcher 3 combat.
todayilearned,ffly6bb,t1_ffjdlfn,1580045595.0,Dope name you got my good Sir.

hempflowers,fdprvu3,t1_fdpjlql,1578638111.0,"Texas won't even prosecute small amounts of marijuana anymore. Costs the state too much money. As long as you DENY that it's marijuana and claim it to be CBD flower, worst they can do is confiscate it. Trick here is though, if it does turn out to be CBD then they're seizing legal property and are then legally liable so most officers, at least in the DFW area, aren't going to fuck with you."
hempflowers,fdprp71,t1_fdok0dw,1578637921.0,Mixing them has been great for me. Reeeally cuts down on the anxiety I get from high THC strains.
hempflowers,fdprlxg,t1_fdoolre,1578637826.0,"Yeah the CBD flower I've bought from smoke shops here in Texas look like ""brick weed"". I assume it's horrible quality. 1 strain gave a noticeable buzz and relaxed effect, the other 2 were far more mild with their effects."
hempflowers,fdpfnnv,t1_fdoqwkk,1578627395.0,Noot noot!
hempflowers,fdkbblg,t1_fdkand8,1578500256.0,"You haven't just lost your mind, you're an idiot. Dog hairs? Might be unpleasant as would getting poorly trimmed product, but to throw it all away? Pure stupidity."
hempflowers,fdkalkc,t1_fdjiic2,1578499809.0,You have lost your damn mind.
hempflowers,fdka81b,t1_fdk8076,1578499572.0,"No, what's sad is that the vendor reached out to you in multiple ways in an attempt to right the wrong and yet you REFUSED their offers and instead came to reddit to trash them."
hempflowers,fditpzj,t3_elkpr1,1578450826.0,Sounds like no one has had issues but OP. Seems fishy imo. I'd disregard OP if I were planning to buy from this vendor in the future.
todayilearned,fdit2h5,t3_ela6ic,1578450414.0,Fuck that website for turning the story into political bullshit though.

todayilearned,fd9ps23,t1_fd7niep,1578236506.0,"True but damn you've really gotta have high volume to make enough dollar wise to cover your rent, employee wages and the cost of the products you order weekly. Plus you have to account for any product wasted which there will almost always be some waste, so that cuts that profit down even further."
trapproduction,fck6khv,t3_ehd4ez,1577718013.0,"When drum samples are layered, and the samples they layered together are also there separately.

I don't want a kick with a hat, if I can't also find that hat solo.

Maybe that's a simple problem, anyone know how I can separate a kick/hat on my end?"
