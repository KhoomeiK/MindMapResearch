Outlander,fdlp2dg,t1_fdlfyze,1578529103.0,This!
Outlander,fdlowm1,t1_fdku3gh,1578528994.0,"Okay i will concede your point that Claire's love for Frank was affected as was his for her. Tough situation for all involved. 

I enjoy watching it with my wife or by myself but i very much enjoy the interactions online regarding Outlander. Soo many great people and so few negative situations.

Hope you find your watching group. You deserve more enjoyment."
Outlander,fdkseoj,t1_fdkrggs,1578510178.0,I disagree on one point. I never got the impression from either the books or the show that Frank expected Claire to be seen and not heard. He saw her as an equal but different partner. She married Jamie due to the circumstances of her situation. She never expected her love for Jamie to be as all encompassing as it was. It also did not change her love for Frank. Her encounters with Black Jack Randall did however.  Frank was a good man who did the best he could in a shitty situation.

Outlander,fd7gq2x,t1_fd7bsqb,1578204233.0," That so nice. Your husband sounds like a great guy. Yeah, i used to identify with Jamie Fraser more but now I more identify with Roger honestly. My father is from Glasgow. I also wore my kilt at my wedding. Lindsay tartan."
Outlander,fd6lhr5,t3_ek15rs,1578192754.0,"Speaking as a man who loves this series. I fell in love with the book 13 years ago and was elated that they were making a show from it but worried they would mess it up. I did not read the book because it was a ""Romance"" though Diana can write that better than anyone I have read so far. There were no steamy pictures of Cait and Sam on the front. Just a blurb on the back about the story and that intrigued me. A-mazing story. I would recommend the books or the show to anyone. My wife did not get into the show until she looked over at what  i was watching on my tablet and there's the scene with Jamie and Randall ""together"" in wentworth prison. Seeing her highly questioning look I said ""It's crucial to the storyline okay!"" She had to watch it after that and loves it. Not nearly as much as I do but that's okay."
