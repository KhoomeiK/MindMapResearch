changemyview,fgtu8y4,t1_fgtn8wp,1581109436.0,"You again are arguing practicality, and not the CMV being presented. I am positing that having the majority of the country not vote for you lessens your mandate to enact policy. This is in the question so saying the popular vote isn’t a thing is to ignore the premise of the question, in which case none of these arguments matter. I am arguing that giving more voting power to people who happen to live in certain geographic regions does not give you a mandate. We don’t have square miles vote, we have people, and as such each person’s vote should be weighted the same. 

You believe that each geographic region needs to be represented, but I can tell you race, education, income, religion, and gender are all a better indicator of which party you favor, so why should geography be the only demographic that weights  votes for the presidential election?"
changemyview,fgsshua,t1_fgspm1r,1581091719.0,"This isn’t a discussion on whether it can be changed or will be changed, it is a discussion that arguing when the president is elected while losing the popular vote it lessens his mandate to enact his policies. And it not being changed to a popular vote is another example of the majority being out voted by the minority basic on geography. 

And to further my point:

The majority do in fact favor a popular vote."
changemyview,fgsnxto,t1_fgsm0eo,1581088874.0,"Hence why I said now, we have changed all of our other elections, it might be time to change the presidential as well.

And if the majority of people in our republic want to move to popular vote I’m not sure if you can say it is not what the US wants."
changemyview,fgsak2p,t1_fgr5ekg,1581078572.0,All of our elections now are by popular vote except for the President. And if that is the case then shouldn’t the President be decided by popular vote so that the majority of people are represented?
changemyview,fgqx12q,t1_fgqtdqy,1581033280.0,"You don’t think race breakdowns are relevant policy wise? That is equivocally untrue, if that were true then minorities in rural areas would vote in line with those areas, which isn’t the case. If you suggest that it matters more if you live in a city or rural, again, we don’t know that is the difference in opinion. Correlation does not imply causation, yes more minorities live in larger cities, is that why they have their political beliefs? Or do large cities have their political beliefs because they are more diverse? 

You also have to remember that neither the city nor the rural area are solid voting blocks, in most places it is close to 60/40 one way or the other. So it isn’t as if rural areas aren’t represented, those States if they vote as a solid block will out weigh cities where the voting is 60/40. So again, the best way to determine the will of the people is to have each person’s vote count equally. 

You also don’t seem to understand in your example candidates are catering to the interests of less people because their votes matter more. They are not appealing to a more diverse group, they are appealing to more States, so instead they appeal to voters based on land area rather what the majority of the population want. I just don’t believe you can call Trump’s base more diverse, just more spread out."
changemyview,fgqjyuo,t1_fgqg71u,1581025647.0,"The problem with this argument is now you are saying those who live in North Dakota, Wyoming, etc. have preferences that are more important than those who live in New York or California. 

Those midwesterners because of the electoral college give more weight to each person. Is that fair? You can even look at the inverse, most of Trump’s voters are rural so can you truly say he had more diverse support if the urban voters didn’t support him? Or if you’d like we can divide it up by other statistics (obviously these are polling because we don’t know actually how everyone voted) and see that most of Trump’s voters were white, so wouldn’t it be better if we had someone’s whose policies appeal to a more diverse demographic?

There are problems however you decide to divide it up, which is why having every person’s vote regardless of who they are be equally important is the most fair way to have an election. Therefore when someone wins who has lost the popular vote it does lessen the legitimacy of the election. 

To your other point, you are right, Trump might have run a different campaign if he knew the popular vote was what mattered, but we will never know how that election would have turned out because we have in place a system where some people’s votes count more than others. And because we don’t know who would have won you cannot say this somehow validates the election."

Look I am am for him over Biden as well, but people have to realize the DNC doesn’t want to help Bernie because he doesn’t help the DNC, if he doesn’t win he will quit the party again, not stay and stump for other democrats to help them get elected. 

If the DNC is trying to favor other candidates then there is a way to fix it, go out and vote for Sanders, if he wins the primaries then he’ll be the candidate. And regardless of who wins Sanders supporters need to realize supporting the democratic nominee is still in their best interest (just as others should support Sanders if he is the nominee)."
