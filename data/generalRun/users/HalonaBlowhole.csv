diving,ffhw8x5,t1_fe4xlai,1579956733.0,"> I just made sure to add silicon grease to the threads to make sure no leaks occurred 

Let me suggest that you switch to Christolube for this. Christolube is a better all around grease, it does not attack and swell O-rings, and more temperature stable, and it's white so it reminds you to regrease everything regular like.

Since I switched to Christolube from Silicone, I have had a huge drop in flooding on my lights"
diving,ffhw1el,t3_en765v,1579956480.0,"Absolutely the TG-6, for the reason you mentioned.

People who have to take pictures as part of things love the TGs for just that reason. Look at the instructors who have to take pictures of customers, and it's either the $50.00 GoPro knockoffs, or TGs in housings. And a TG in a housing is actually really Tough.

In the end, everything will flood. A camera that can survive a flood is a camera worth buying. Unless it's so cheap you don't care."
japan,ffhvm29,t1_ffhvaoi,1579955957.0,"> What differences does polarized vs. non-polarized plugs have anyways?

In practice, none whatsoever. When the US standard was developed, it was thought that motors and whatnot could use the polarization for extra protection. In practice, that has been taken over by the grounding plug (the third, round one), and the widespread adoption of GFCI circuits has made other reasons less important.

But once a system is in place, nothing much changes. So US stuff that does not have a three prong plug pretty much all have polarized plugs. 

For no reason. Other than to frustrate me when I am trying to plug things in, either because the orientation's wrong, or because I am trying to plug things into a Japanese outlet.

When you look at pictures, it seems like things are Japan and US interchangeable. In practice, it's a frustrating little thing. 

One nice thing about Japan is that pretty much every 100yen shop has screw together plugs you can attaching to your US cords after you cut them off."
japan,ffhv3na,t1_ffhtqw5,1579955310.0,"The stuff sold in the US almost always come with polarized plugs for no reason.

Since the Japanese outlets are not polarized, thats  problem unless you nip/file off the polarizing fins, or carry a bunch of surge suppressors from the US."
japan,ffhs6e9,t1_ffekuti,1579951128.0," The US plugs have two differences they are polarized (or can be), and are grounded (or can be).

Things simply use polarized plug because that's what they are attached to generally. I have ground the polarized bit off most of my stuff over time since I have a mix of Japanese and US stuff.

Once the polarized bit is gone, everything is interchangeable."
scuba,ffhinxi,t1_ffhbucd,1579936982.0,"I have de-colded all my regs! A lot of my TX-50s came from various parts from all the different re-badged TX-50s (Zeagle, Beauchat).

What the difference between those two?"
scuba,ffhan0y,t3_etd881,1579928050.0,"There is some getting used to on the Gorillas, because of the different flex on the directions. After you get used to them you forget about it. 

Technique's not the issue so much as your body adapting to it, because a fair number of fins have differing up and down flex. But the Gorillas will always be most powerful in a standard flutter kick. Again, that's true of a lot of fins, and the flutter will always be the most powerful, and most efficient kick anyway, regardless of the fin.

The Gos do not have the same issue because of their shape. I have not spent much time in the booted Gos."

If it is mounted on your left, it depends on how big you are. Smaller divers can donate shorter hoses usefully, as long as they are left mounted (Or orientation agnostic) and don't put that backwards loop in."
