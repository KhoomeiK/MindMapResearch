I have 28 girls coming.’ It was him and Epstein.”...Before the “calendar girl” event, Houraney warned Trump about Epstein once again.“Look, Donald, I know Jeff really well, I can’t have him going after younger girls,” Houraney recalled telling Trump in the *Times* interview. “He said: ‘Look I’m putting my name on this.

>Donald and Melania Trump often have told the story about how they met at a Manhattan nightclub during New York Fashion Week in 1998.Jeffrey Epstein has never figured into this origin story — but the financier and former Trump friend has tried to take credit for this historical encounter between the future president and first lady.The New York Times, [reporting](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/trump-epstein.html) on Trump’s long and difficult friendship with the newly jailed accused sex trafficker, said that Epstein was very eager to play up his connections to Trump after the 2016 election. One way Epstein did this was by “claiming that he was the one who introduced Trump to his third wife,” the Times reported....In Donald and Melania Trump’s version of how they met, they give credit to another person for their introduction: modeling agent Paolo Zampolli. The agent threw the party at the Kit Cat Club, where the then-celebrity real estate mogul spotted a beautiful 28-year-old model from Slovenia named Melania Knauss. At the time, Trump was still married, though separated from his second wife, Marla Maples. He also was on a date with another woman....Melania called, they went on a date, Donald soon got his divorce from Maples, and the two eventually married in 2005.If Epstein made claims that he somehow brought Donald and Melania Trump together, he could argue that the timing made sense.From the 1980s through the early 2000s, Trump and Epstein were Palm Beach neighbors and Manhattan high-flyers who shared an an appreciation for wealth and for being seen together at fabulous parties, especially if beautiful women were present, according to the New York Times and other publications.“I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,” Trump famously told New York magazine in 2002. \[Note: If true, this means they'd been friends since at least 1987.\] “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”

Even when Trump announced England’s Prince Andrew, many in the crowd doubted his presence. For one, he stayed in the background, introducing himself as Andrew York, and for two, he’s recently shed 20 pounds, making him a possible double for actor Rupert Everett.” Trump is pictured with Melania and Prince Andrew, while Epstein and Maxwell are photographed with Michael Bolton.
