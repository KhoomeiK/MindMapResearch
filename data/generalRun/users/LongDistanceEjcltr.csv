Basically all my upwards career movement (except one) came from me leaving the previous position for a better opportunity elsewhere. My first job was a EU-sponsored position (a company that used EU grants for IT projects) with union-like properties (salary from a table etc.) and the amout of red tape was fucking bullshit... not to mention there was a ton of space for corruption (and it happened a lot). What I've seen in meritocratic, profit driven companies was that they either got something right or went out of business... and when you did right by them, they paid you well. Today I'm in a position of leading a small team and having enough money to not have to worry about money (and in fact saving a bunch), which would never happen if I stayed in the same company or two.

WorldOfWarships,fcedsx1,t1_fcd1gkd,1577619540.0,"Don't only look up how to shoot (aiming is mostly about practice, there's not much to learn per se), look up what to shoot (ammo) and where to shoot (given the ammo you have loaded, where you should be trying to hit the enemy). For example: AP shells (of sufficient caliber) will give you the best DPM if you're shooting flat broadsides, but enough angle (or armor) and they start bouncing (or shattering). On the other hand HE shells (of sufficient caliber) will typically not give you the best DPM, but they don't care about angle, only about armor (that is why it's generally a good idea to aim at the superstructure of battleships when you have HE loaded) and they set fires.

Other than that... look up what is a citadel, how fires and floodings work, how spotting works, how smokes work, what is hydro and (later, T7 and up) what is radar. 

If you're getting wrecked as you say, generally just try to stay at 45 degree angle to any battleships that have a clear line of fire on you and as far as positioning goes, try to stay in the middle of the pack (not in front, not in the back), there is safety in numbers and especially for a beginner, there's very little chance you'll know enough to make your own plays (positioning is what separates unicums from flamuu and it's the ultimate skill in this game that needs thousands of games to learn), so just stick to your teammates (which will also make it harder for a carrier to ass blast you). To help you with positioning, it's generally a good idea to make the minimap as large as it can be (yes, that large), enable its opacity and enable last known positions of ships."

WorldOfWarships,fcaczxc,t1_fcabxfg,1577567047.0,"> That applies to most DDs anyway

No it doesn't. Not to mention most DDs are smoke DDs, completely refuting your argument.

> Smoke only serves as a temporary deterrent, if a carrier wants you sunk, he is going to sink you.

Shows how much you know about the game. Outside of competitive, not a single carrier is going to hover over your smoke or even blindtorp your smoke for its duration, that's just nonsense. They force you to ""waste"" smoke, but that's about it, then they go their own way to farm damage. It's a rush against time for them. Have you ever played the new CVs or watched someone good? They go from target to target, switching to appropriate squadrons to get a fire (rockets/bombs), then try to flood with torps, once they get that ticking, then attack a different target and repeat. They just don't have time to fuck around your smoke. But a Kahab? Triple rocket salvo is not a problem. If you look juicy enough (away from the fleet/broken enough) they will revisit you again with a second squad of rockets and you're fucksville.

> You could argue that the Khab is actually better off in a way because it's not a capping DD

Lmfao, you think that in a CV game any DD is a capping DD? Nobody with above average stats does that anymore. Once the game plays out a bit and you see where all the radars are, what caps could you snatch, then you go in, but that may be 5, 10 minutes in."
WorldOfWarships,fcacl9v,t3_egtfkz,1577566803.0,"Sure, but if you meet something like IFHE Bismarck or Massa, they will just turn around once they see you and kite away while they burn you to death. 15 games into ranked I'm yet to lose a single game in Massa with the tactic of ""enter the cap, turn around ass first while eating as few big AP hits as you can and just kite away"". It's super easy to dodge Tirpitz / Eugen torps that way, DDs that yolo you just melt to your secondaries (like everything else)."
WorldOfWarships,fcaau1h,t1_fca2geb,1577565812.0,"Now repeat what you just said in a carrier game. Doesn't really make sense to point out the strenghts of a ship without mentioning the weaknesses. If you get your Khaba out in a carrier game, you are fucked unless the carrier ignores you. And I don't mean ""you'll have a harder time"" kind of fucked, I mean the ""he completely shits on your playstyle"" fucked. You have garbage spotting range, you have no smoke to hide yourself in, you're just a damage piñata for the rocket planes which would be bearable if every single rocket attack didn't break your engine, rudder or both. Once you get that shit broken, you're so easy to ass blast by battleship AP (unlike other DDs), it's not even funny. The only other DD eating full BB AP pens is Harugumo, which is a smoke boat with strong torps, and it's much harder to punish by a carrier than Kahab is not only because of the smoke, but also because of the playstyle. Khab is supposed to be a kiting DD on a flank, by definition kinda alone and isolated, which makes you even juicier target to a CV since you have no AA protection.

I have close to 100 ships on my account now, 12 T10 ships and I don't play my Khaba like... ever. It's such a discouraging feeling knowing that once you hit that battle button and there's a CV, you might as well exit to port, that I rather play something else every single time."
