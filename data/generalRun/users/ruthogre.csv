1. candy wrappers - this is where I started. not collecting them anymore but they should be remembered.
2. gift wraps - wrappers are always carefully opened, never torn.
3. ribbons
4. paper or plastic bags (from the grocery stores)
5. containers (glass, paper, plastic, etc.)
6. twist ties
7. blank (or almost blank) papers
8. Corningware (from thrift stores)
9. dresses that fit me (from thrift stores)
10. scarfs

I'm sure there are more things I collect. It's also difficult for me not to collect things."
