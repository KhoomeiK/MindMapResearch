therapy,fffbtt2,t3_etbz8d,1579880514.0,Just do it. You'll feel much better after going for the first time. I made an appointment and then canceled it and then rescheduled it because I was nervous. But now I don't know what I would've done if I hadn't gone.
therapy,ffbyblo,t3_esneyd,1579786649.0,I started a few months ago and at every session I go through my week. We talk about things I did and the things that bothered me. I find it to be a good way to get me talking and jump into larger issues from there.
depression,fcoafmg,t1_fcoa3tn,1577827453.0,The roller coaster has been nuts. Like the worst one I've ever been on. Like the shoulder harness is so fucking tight and I'm stuck riding this piece of shit. Overall I've felt I've been living the same day for six months.
depression,fco00iu,t3_ei7mgi,1577821630.0,"The second half of 2019 was definitely the worst. My whole life just crashed down in an instant. My mental heath, which was never great to begin with, took a nose dive. I had anxiety about this for years, that one day I would just lose it. It happened when I was in relatively good place too and now I'm filled with fear that any good moment/hour/day/week is going to be followed by a terrible one.  

But Happy New Year I guess. Here's hoping!"
depression,fcn4hca,t1_fcmtrss,1577803017.0,I agree. Depression should buy me dinner because I like to be wined and dined before I get fucked.
depression,fbe8auz,t3_ecx5n6,1576780447.0,I usually head into a new year with some form of optimism. Even if it's faint trace of it but this year I feel completely numb and lost and scared and tired and overwhelmed and a plethora of other things. None of them good.
