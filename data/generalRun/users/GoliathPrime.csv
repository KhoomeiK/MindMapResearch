Lovecraft,ff2hvtq,t3_eqyh6d,1579506836.0,"I have a personal take on the relationship between Dagon and Cthulhu, but it's only based on a few lines from Mountains of Madness.

My theory is that the Deep Ones, along with Shoggoths, were the result of genetic engineering by the Elder Things.  In the Mountains of Madness, one of the frescos inside the ruined city shows the Elder Things discovering that the genetic waste left over from the creation of the Shoggoths had spawned life on earth and took to experimenting upon it.   One of the experiments had ""vaguely anthropoidal outlines"" and the human scientists believe this implies the Elder Things might have given rise to humanity.  

However, the time period they are looking at was the Devonian and mammals wouldn't evolve for millions of years.  So, the only two options are the Deep Ones or the Serpent People, or maybe both.   The Elder Things took to experimenting on these creatures and torturing them for amusement.   Shortly following their discovery of earth-life, the Shoggoth rebellion took place and was swiftly put down by the Elder Things.  Thereafter, Cthulhu and his kin showed up and waged war upon the Elder Things, destroying vast sections of their empire and forcing an armistice near the end of the Triassic.

I believe that the Serpent People (who taught Abd Al Hazrad and instructed him to write the Necronomicon), the Deep Ones and the Shoggoths all viewed Cthulhu as their savior for fighting against the Elder Things.   It would explain why the Deep Ones and Shoggoths are often found together and why Dagon, the oldest of the Deep Ones and who most likely remembers the war, venerates Cthulhu.   

Whether Cthulhu cares about them or even knows about them is unknown.

Scenario B: Years later a dying Armitage discovers another passage in the Necronomicon detailing how Yog-Sothoth seeds the earth with his offspring.  He realizes that the twins were never supposed to survive, they were meant to die as a sacrifice so that their blood would pour into the earth and corrupt it.

In my dream I woke up in my room and noticed a strange kind of ambient, slowly pulsing light pouring through my window.  I got up and went outside to find my great uncle sitting on a lawnchair with his dogs to either side.  He beckoned me over and popped the top of a bottle of Miller Beer.  

""Hey boy"" he said, ""Lemme ask you; you ever seen anything like that?"" and he points up.  I look into the sky and instead of stars and clouds it gears.  Giant, rusting gears; a vast clockwork mechanism that stretched across the whole of the cosmos.  And in its midst there was a clock with one of those stylized suns with human faces.  It stared at me with empty eyes and I watched as the clock hands moved to midnight.  The whole sky began to ring with distant sounds of countless clocks ringing in the witches hour.

My great uncle tapped me on the shoulder and asked: ""...or whatever those things are?""  and pointed towards the pond.  Out of dark waters of the pond a horde of strange creatures waddled and brayed.  They were something like upright turtles or penguins, but with faces that were something like buzzards and something like horses.  Their voices raised to drown out the sounds of the clocks and they flapped their flippers against their shells to drown out the cosmic ticking.

My great uncle tapped me on the shoulder again and said: ""time to go.""  He went back into the house and I followed him.  ""Time to sleep"" he said and I went back to my bedroom.  He stood at my door and looked at me, his dogs by his side.

30 years later, my great uncle came to live with us as he was starting to suffer from dementia.  His wife had died years before, but Rosemarie was still around and he brought the tortoise with him and promptly set her free on our property.  She soon disappeared, but my great uncle was unconcerned - she's be back he said.  She always comes back a few times a year.

So months go by and I find my great uncle chopping up strawberries and cantaloupes into little pieces and putting them into ziploc bags.  I asked what he was doing and he said it's about time for Rosemarie to come back, so he was getting some food ready for her.  I thought he was nuts, because that tortoise was long gone.

But to my surprise, my great uncle was right.  Rosemarie came back and hung out with us for about a week.  She got a bath and some fruit and some live bait and then, she was gone again to parts unknown.  Then about four months later, she was back again.  My great uncle said you could set your clock by her.  She'd always come back every few months,  and depending on the winter you'd see her twice or three times a year.  

Rosemarie outlived my great uncle.  Eventually we moved away.  I went back hoping to find her, but never could.  I wonder if she's still out there to this day.  

So if any of you live in Southeast Texas, and ever come across a big, brown tortoise with weird spikes on her butt and faded roses on her shell, well, now you know her backstory.  Hope you are okay Rosemarie.  I never really knew you, you never stayed around long enough."
