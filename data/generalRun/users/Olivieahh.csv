bipolar,ff5ka87,t3_erpwp8,1579596921.0,I was just diagnosed with bp 2. I can relate to this 100%. I noticed it around 9-10 when I would be so tired my eyes would water but couldn’t sleep at night. I didn’t even know what mental health was at that age and couldn’t trust my parents let alone confide in them or ask for help. I remember seeing flashes of light and silhouettes in my room at night. I would see shadowy figures and little crawly creatures on the floor. I hated sleeping and would panic before bed every night. I was in elementary school. I slept with every single light on because I was so scared. It’s heart breaking looking back now and seeing how much pain I was in. I wish I could comfort my old self and understand what was happening to me mentally. I haven’t had those issues in a while thank god.
bipolar,ff2k8nl,t3_eraib5,1579509962.0,Sounds like you’re doing great! What meds are you on? I just was diagnosed and so excited for the day I can do all you’ve just described. What has your journey been like?
bipolar,ff1q7vx,t1_ff1pb96,1579483757.0,You could find a free support group in your area. I just found one where I live.
bipolar,ff11yqd,t3_equpvw,1579474410.0,"I will be your friend. I feel alone too. I have people in my life who support me but they don’t truly understand what it’s like to feel trapped in this prison. I can be your friend if you need one. I’m so truly sorry for what you’ve gone through. I know it probably feels like it’s all for nothing, but being recently diagnosed I’m terrified of what’s to come. But seeing how much you have conquered has given me hope. It might feel like the end right now, but like you said it’s not you. It’s this disease. You have come so far for a reason I know you can keep going I believe in you!"
bipolar,ff0skdc,t3_eqxryl,1579471902.0,My psychiatrist said it’s genetic and that trauma can trigger it or make it worse. I believe that’s true. I was born with this genetically and would have to deal with this regardless. I also experience a lot of trauma for the past 10 years which I know have made my symptoms worse.
bipolar,ff0q749,t3_er0jh5,1579471285.0,This is amazing!! Knowing how to take care of yourself the best way you can is a talent if I’ve ever seen one.
bipolar,fezqaml,t1_fey9o8x,1579460302.0,I’m wondering if mine is going to even work at 25mg at night lol. In two weeks I’m supposed to up it to 50 and maybe I’m supposed to keep upping the dosage from there? I’ll have to clarify with my Dr. but she didn’t mention to keep adding to the dose. I wish there was just a test to tell me exactly what I need and how much lol.
bipolar,feuvngp,t1_fe6r8f1,1579390406.0,Thank you so much!! I think it’s just so scary because this is all so new to me. Feels like a new chapter of my life has started without me turning the page. I’m 22 and it feels like my life is over. I keep telling myself to be patient and that my time will come and something will start to work. It just sucks during the waiting period!
bipolar,feuv7l6,t1_fe7dacr,1579390303.0,"Hi!! Thank you so much for the response. I’m sorry it took a few days, I’ve been in the thick of it lately. Even with medication not “fixing” bipolar, will it help so I can function a bit better? Right now I’m at the point where I can barely leave my house. I’ve started working from home because I can’t physically do it. I just want to be at the point where I can do what normal people do and run errands, enjoy music, watch tv without my mind trying to ruin everything."
bipolar,feutlr8,t1_feujb9g,1579389755.0,What is your experience with lamotrigine? I just was diagnosed bipolar and tonight will be my second dose of 25 mg. I haven’t had a medication yet that’s worked because this is all so new to me. What does it feel like when it’s working? How do you know if it does?
bipolar,fe6j7jh,t1_fe5e7ji,1578892634.0,I’m so sorry to hear that. I wish I had your positive outlook and strength
