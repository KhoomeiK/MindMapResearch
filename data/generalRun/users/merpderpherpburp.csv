He skipped two years but didn't want to skip more and be left out. One of the other kids dad was a stock broker and did a fun project in our math class once a week where he taught us how to trade stocks. We did mock stock trades each week on teams of 3. Not gonna lie, the smart kid was kinda a weirdo so no one wanted to partner with him but he didn't bother me cause I'm also kind of a weirdo. He almost near perfectly predicted trends and tripled our ""profits"" over the 6 weeks based on math and the data presented to us. The stock broker dad was so excited each week to show the whole class the results. 
This kid now works at a jiffy lube in our hometown and despite being made offers to go into college for free never went. He said he only graduated high school to make his mom happy and he didn't really like school.
