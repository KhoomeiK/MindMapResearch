nfl,feeyyvv,t1_feeylgj,1579044311.0,"Ouch. Yeah, really can't fault Buckner for a secondary that can't stop anyone, but I guess that goes both ways. Did they replace the defensive backs coach? 

We'll double back next year and see how it turns out. I know just about everyone I know as a Dallas fan was happy to turnover a new leaf. Marinelli obviously knows the game, but his vanilla schemes (while he was still the DC) and inability to get consistent pressure from the line were his ultimate undoing.

Now we're about to go the polar opposite in Nolan. A guy who goes aggressive for sacks and turnovers but gives up more on the backend. Should be an interesting transition."

nfl,feexbxn,t1_feewqz7,1579043255.0,"Yeah. Didn't realize they were that good against the run. Wish it translated more to playoffs wins, but the D was ass when they made it to the playoffs. Good work though. More evidence to Garrett's inability to get a team over the hump so to speak. 

The ""last leg"" thing was tongue in cheek. He literally limps on the sideline like he needs a new hip. It's painful to watch. He has also said  or insinuated on multiple occasions the last two offseasons that he was gonna hang it up.

So yes, you are replacing a young, up and coming guy who has already turned around a terrible unit with a 70-year-old who has openly talked about retiring and can literally barely move around the sideline. So, yeah, that was all spot-on.

Good work internet sleuthing though. I always forget how much Redditor's pride themselves on being right."
nfl,feev6wm,t1_feetkot,1579041916.0,How were their sack numbers in those seasons?
nfl,feesu7f,t1_feeref5,1579040469.0,"No, I decided to actually watch the games. Every game in his Dallas tenure. They couldn't get teams off the field when they needed to to win games. They couldn't get to the QB when they needed to. They couldn't stop the run when they needed to. Hence, they didn't make the playoffs and got beat by an Eagles teams missing almost all their starting skill positions on offense. Last year, when they did make the playoffs, they got absolutely GASHED in the run game. You know, one of the things a defensive line is supposed to pride itself on stopping. 

Try looking at the entire picture, instead of stats in a vacuum. The NFCEast has been historically bad recently, something that stats won't tell you, but actually watching football will. 

Oh but please continue to enlighten me and sing the praises of a man who has literally said each of the last two off seasons that he was retiring.

Dak threw for the most passing yards this season, how'd that turn out. Not everything is in the stats, champ. I'm sure someone has room for a gopher on their ""analytics"" team for you though."
nfl,feeos07,t3_eore8w,1579038073.0,"Gruden doing good ol' boy things.

Marinelli's lines in Dallas weren't good against the run or pass. He's said he was going to retire, or alluded to it for serveral years. They just fired a bright, up and coming coach, for one on his last leg--and that one is gimpy."

You're probably right, but Alex Smith isn't out of the NFL yet and if they do cut him it will probably have more to do with that insane extension than the eventual turnout of his injury."
nfl,fdr7chy,t1_fdr719b,1578680530.0,"Haha not combative. Was kind of mocking myself. Tough to get tone across on here.

Rumor is he's dead set on being on the sidelines again as a player. We'll see what happens. Jaylon Smiths injury was worse than Alex Smiths and he's doing OK, granted he's about a century younger."
nfl,fdr67ap,t1_fdqn6mq,1578680063.0,"He's not out of the NFL at all. He's still under contract with the Redskins. If/when he's no longer with them, it will almost surely be because of his cap hit.

To clarify: Writing for big media companies that make millions of dollars. They (the company and audience) stifle your passion in order to feed their mindless readers instead of encouraging individuality and creativity. I accepted what I thought was my dream job as a writer/editor some time ago and have regretted almost since. Unfortunately, I also put myself in a position financially where I am beholden to the paychecks that I am ""fucking lucky"" to be getting."
