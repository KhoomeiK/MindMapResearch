Wrong again. As a journalist, I know better. News is news. Sensationalist stories about celebrities dying that blatantly ignore the other 6 people who died in the same accident are not news. 

You have no idea what defines good journalism. The good thing about the internet is your opinion has no weight and thus your poorly formed view of what is acceptable journalism and what is not will never amount to anything. 

Ironically, free will has nothing to do with anything here, so once again you are just making shit up to support your poorly formed opinion.

The point is this was never news to begin with. It was a tabloid article at best, and instead of it being a blip on the radar, it was a 3 day shit-storm of the same news story that only focused on Kobe and his daughter while largely ignoring the other 6 people who also died tragically, as well as ignoring every other news story going on in the world at the time.

Here in America, the cost of your service is not included in your bill - as stated previously several times, if you want that to be the case we will gladly add automatic gratuity to your bill. 

If you paid less than 10% tip for your supposedly below par service (pretty sure you don't know the difference between good and bad service based on your complete lack of knowledge on anything in the service industry) you stiffed your server.

Can't believe I have to repeat myself for the 18 billionth time here, but you are clearly needing some direction:

Here in America, you pay tips to be waited on. If you are not waited on then you do not have to tip. If you are waited on, then you owe the person who waited on you a tip. The amount varies between services: 20% for dining, 10% for takeout, delivery and problematic service, $1 per drink at a cash bar, $5 for valet, and 10-15% for other services like a massage, getting your nails done, etc. I realize this is difficult for foreigners to understand and remember, but there is only one you need to remember: 20% for dining.

Once again, I have to explain this to you like you are five:
If you receive service, you owe the person that served you for their service. It is unacceptable to refuse to pay for service you received, just like in any other line of business. If there is a problem or you do not appreciate the service you are receiving, you take the issue up with management (just like every other line of business in existence) and pay a reduced price. If the service you received really was as poor as you want to suppose in your argument for reasons that *only* your server could control, you still tip 10% on the pre-comp'd bill total because 8% of that is already being taken away from your server in taxes (once again, you would know this if you had *any* experience working in the service industry), so effectively you are giving a tip of 2% - pretty close to your ridiculous notion of 1% anyways. 

The point that you are missing and that makes your actions unacceptable is that when you leave less than 10% you are forcing the server to pay the taxes on your food. Never do you get to decide that you are going to make the person who delivered a paid service for you pay for that service when the up-front agreement was that you would pay for the service you requested. Try it with your mechanic, your electrician, your trash guy. See how far you get before they either take away your service indefinitely or get the law involved for being stiffed. 

Just because you think you can get away with stiffing your server does not make it acceptable behavior, and really you wont get away with it because you will just be denied service next time you go to that establishment since the people who work there know you will refuse to pay.

The problem is you think you get to decide who gets paid and who doesn't even if you receive service 100% of the time. I'll say it again since you are too inept to get it the first 5 times I said it: THE ONLY TIME YOU ARE ALLOWED TO LEAVE ZERO TIP IS IF YOU RECEIVED ZERO SERVICE.

Tipping culture exists for more reasons than the single one you are giving. We would not continue to work under those unfair conditions if it did not benefit us in the end. Uncapped cash tips are a big benefit, and in the end make it possible for you to afford going out in the first place since menu prices would be 15-20% higher if they included service fees in menu prices.

The reason it is not more popular in non-American countries has to do with how we view servers as a job. Here the stereotype is a high school or college student working part time. Nearly everywhere else it is a real profession where students attend higher education to learn the etiquette and skills necessary to give 5-star service. The only people who do that here are Sommeliers, and they are treated with the high respect that all well trained servers should be treated with.

As a matter of fact, yes, I often do give tips to people who would not otherwise expect to receive one, and they are always very happy to receive it.

Iamactuallyverybadass,fff38f2,t1_ffcaxzz,1579874503.0," I'm just pointing out the obvious, since clearly you are too stupid to figure it out yourself.

And no, buddy, go read your previous comment. All it says is: 'You must be a retard...' which is the pathetic baseline you set here, and is equivalent to just yelling ""retard"" at anyone who disagrees with you.

The fact remains that only sociopaths and psychopaths go around murdering small wild animals with their bare hands, and only other sociopaths and psychopaths promote that behavior as acceptable."
unpopularopinion,fff2xvm,t1_ffc9kl5,1579874275.0,"Yes, it is possible, but it also raises the overhead cost of running the business dramatically. Expect to pay 15-20% more at any real restaurant that does not accept tips.

Your other comparison is false: You are responsible for clearing your table if you are not paying someone else to do it for you. That means you are responsible for clearing your table at fast food restaurants. The only thing that counter worker should have to do on the floor is wipe down the tables every once in awhile - a completely different level of service than any restaurant with servers."
unpopularopinion,fff2m08,t1_ffc9jqh,1579874015.0,"Have you ever been to a real 5-star restaurant? That is the level of service all servers should strive for. It's kind of insane how much we do, including putting your napkin on your lap for you and even cutting your grandmother's steak for her. I highly recommend trying it just for the experience, if not also for the amazing menu.

Etiquette is a dying practice. And it infuriates me that some people think it is okay to compare what a 5-star waiter does to a high school student working at Waffle House."

unpopularopinion,fff28ul,t1_ff6l1av,1579873725.0,"Unfortunately, that could not be further from the truth. While wage law says you will be paid full minimum wage if you do not receive enough tips to make that wage, proving that is happening to you is insanely difficult. Most restaurants pay their employees every 2 weeks, and by law you have to go 2 full paychecks of being underpaid before collecting. Since most of us live paycheck-to-paycheck (not even that really, cash in hand each night is the only thing paying our bills) we cannot afford to wait that long just to try to collect a couple hundred dollars at minimum wage, and even then there is zero assurance your employer will actually pay up. Many establishments will refuse to pay, fire you for asking, or make up excuses to make you leave the job, because in reality the number of times that wage difference is made up is almost zero."

You are visiting another country that has culture different from your own. It's fine if you don't like it - I don't like the way Arab nations treat anyone, much less their women, but you don't see me stepping off the plane in Saudi Arabia and immediately calling bullshit on the first hijab being worn. Likewise, you don't get to refuse to abide by our rules when you are here just because you are a foreigner. 

Talk is cheap. Good service is not. Clearly your work experience has not taught you that. If you don't want to pay tip, there are a whole host of fast food and buffet style restaurants that are self-serve, so you can clean up after yourself and not have to leave a tip, and you are welcome to eat at those establishments as much as you like. But if you expect to be served, you better expect to pay a 20% tip on top of your bill to be served in America."
unpopularopinion,fff1e1o,t1_ff6jw0b,1579873021.0,"The cost of your service is not part of your bill, ever, unless you have automatic gratuity added to your bill. The cost of your food and drinks is much lower since the cost of your service has not been built into the restaurant's overhead and thus into the menu prices. See how that works? Your bill would be *much* higher if restaurants started paying servers a full wage and including the cost of service in their menu items, and then you would probably complain about not being able to afford to go out at all."
