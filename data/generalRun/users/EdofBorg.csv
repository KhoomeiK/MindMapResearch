Clinton started the then longest running economic expansion is US history. Was actually paying on National Debt. Got people off welfare. Lied about a blowjob.

Let the banks run amok again and stood idly by as the detonated an attack on our financial systems nearly causing Great Depression 2.0.

Obama. Tried to give us universal Healthcare. Got Osama bin Laden who Bush 43 let go at Tora Bora like daddy did Saddam. Brought unemployment down to 4.7 and the DOW to record valuation. Wore a light colored suit once. The bastard. Began longest running economic expansion.

Trump. Pissed on American intelligence agencies while standing next to KGB assassin on foreign soil. Openly mocked reporter with disability. Got caught paying pornstar for sex while wife's giner was still recovering from popping out another grifter. Extorted a strategic ally to investigate political opponent......

They didn't do a damn thing to her until she attacked a CPS Supervisor making a visit to check on the kids. Then the guy was taken serious.

The next day I thought it was all just a dream and started telling her about it down to the part about missing my body and looking at her. She was white as a sheet as I got to that part and then she told me, before I finished mind you, that I looked at myself and then at her and she freaked out and laid there all night wondering what she had seen.

After that I used to roam around my town at night while asleep. Actually a state I induced by meditation that would eventually lead to real sleep.

Developing this ability can be really annoying though since when you close your eyes wanting to sleep and it looks the same like your spirit is just looking right through your eyelids. You wake up hours later and you don't feel like you were asleep most of the time. Not tired but hyper aware of what is going on around you while even asleep. It also makes dreams and even nightmares seem boring and mundane."

socialism,ff1v88h,t3_eqyks8,1579486928.0,"Capitalism ensures that you get the least product/service for the most amount of money. With the most obvious example being America Healthcare Industry. The highest costing and rated 11th or worse in the world. Education? 25th or worse in science and Math. No. 1 in Violence. No. 1 in people in prison. And ranked No. 8 in nest place to live in overall metrics. 22 Trillion National Debt that hasn't shrunk since Clinton and that's just the debt on the public set of books. We borrow from Communist countries.

That's the manifestation of Capitalism.

It is cheaper for an insurance company to fly patients to other countries with better hospitals and doctors and pay for convalescent time than have it done here. Better for everyone. Cheaper for insurance and likely better outcome for patient.

Manipulations of drugs and drug prices to gouge insurance companies.  Banks manipulating deposits and payment times and dates tonget late fees. Car dealers selling cars to people who can't afford them, repossessing and repeating over and over. 20 cents worth of corn turned into a $3 snack or box of cereal.

Paid off government so you get things like Ethanol Mandates.  Ethanol has less energy than gas so you use more. Money still goes to fuel industry to blend fuel. Price of feed corn goes up and puts good beef outside the budgets of millions of families. Your tax dollars laundered through the government to corporations.

This waste, fraud, abuse, gouging goes on everywhere at every level of business in America. Its why you pay so much for an American product and have to settle for ChinaMart shit to survive."

You figure this out when you are the one giving the jab. Well you figure it out if you have any self awareness which most people don't. Most people mistake egocentric for introspection. 

 I rarely, if ever, make a jab personal. But everytime I do its pretty close to what I think of the person."

One quibble though. Lying about a BJ and all the shit Trump has done including the Ukraine extortion are so much worse its not even the same ballpark.

clevercomebacks,ff1hm6k,t3_er0hr1,1579479363.0,"In the 80s the Republicans ignored AIDS thinking a virus could tell if you are gay. Viruses work at a DNA level. So while letting gay people die is apparently the Christian Rights way they failed to realize that if a virus can tell you are gay from DNA then being gay must be genetic. Which is counter to their bullshit about it being a life choice. 

Republican are dangerous and stupid. The AIDS thing is proof enough but they also trained Osama bin Laden to hold off Russia in Afghanistan. For the politically illiterate see Rambo 3. Then when we had what we wanted we pooped on them.

The dangerous stupidity of Republicans becomes again evident when 19 guys trained by their protege then executes the costliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil in history. 19 dudes! With fucking boxcutters! Bitch slap America and murder 3000 people! While Republicans are on watch!  And while the tards are busy murdering Iraqi civilians the banks plan and execute a financial terrorist attack on the world economy making the dollar cost of 9/11 look like an unexpected parking ticket. AGAIN ON REPUBLICANS WATCH!

At least 1 year left of Republican rule. How much longer can the FED prop up the stock prices with dirt cheap money? Trump has pissed on America standing next to a murderer on foreign soil. Assassinated enemies on friendly soil. And let the world unequivocally know America while a useful idiot with a gun can't be trusted anymore. As we speak the rest of the world is working on a way to nullify us by getting rid of our Reserve Currency Status. A banking system we can't manipulate and rig for ourselves.

And that folks is the day we become just another failed nuclear armed state like Russia. And you can thank Republicans for it."
