germanshepherds,fgubfi9,t1_fgu8yqe,1581116770.0,"Ok, was just curious. I noticed a massive change in my dude when we started exercising a lot. In the summer I ride my bike while he runs, we would do about 10-20km a day, with him averaging speeds of roughly 15km/hr and topping out at 35+km/hr.  With winter being here we are limited to walks but still try for about 6-10km a night. The drive and determination a GSD has is unwavering. It's a beautiful thing, and I get why people love the breed so much."
germanshepherds,fgu8czv,t1_fgu7mpg,1581114810.0,How much exercise do you give him?

germanshepherds,fgtvq0j,t3_f0cb6w,1581109974.0,"I locked my boy in the kitchen the first few days I had him, he opened all the doors in the house, accessed upstairs and downstairs, and tore the baby gates down. 

I decided to say 'fuck it' and gave him free roam of the house, now the only time he wreaks havoc is when he hasn't been exercised in a few days. 

I have lived with/owned a few dogs and would NEVER crate my GSD. They are far too intelligent and loyal to be locked away."

trashy,fgojkm4,t3_ezg3rb,1580972387.0,"And now his face and name are all over the internet and the free fame he wanted has come true because of idiots reporting it. Instead, we should blur his face and make him fight a rabid chimpanzee on live tv. Mandatory rabid chimp fights for all influencers that do something stupid for fame and attention."
