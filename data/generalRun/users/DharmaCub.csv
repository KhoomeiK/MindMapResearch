I benifit from white privelage most of the time so for the sake of most conversations I am white, but  we are kinda a separate catagory thanks to the thousands of years of persecution. Maybe it's not a different race but more of an ethnicity. Most white people have a nationality, but white is kind of it's own ethnicity.
