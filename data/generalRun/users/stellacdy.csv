aww,ffe6b37,t1_ffe5ieo,1579837846.0,Thank you!
aww,ffe5y3b,t1_ffe5oib,1579837569.0,"From Deathnote, my ex was way into it and she was a slasher as a kitten."
childfree,ffa59tt,t3_esd80s,1579728152.0,That's how girls have been duped in the past. Tell them it's this miracle when in reality it's a car wreck.
fatlogic,ff95kqb,t3_es9tum,1579705368.0,"That's it, fatphobia has lost all meaning. We no longer have to take the accusation seriously."
AskWomen,ff2084q,t3_eqxwpp,1579490344.0,While he was backing out of a parking spot he hit a pole. He yelled at me for not telling him we were parked next to a pole. He drove and he parked the car in this spot.
loseit,fez12v1,t3_eqx3px,1579452920.0,Are you able to join an after school sport? A lot of times the coaches will give dietary guidelines then you can say that coach doesn't want you to drink soda or coach said to eat steamed broccoli. If they don't trust doctors maybe sports is the way to reach them.
AskWomen,fep5057,t3_eq2kln,1579312261.0,"Dresses, sexy, sexy dresses."
fatlogic,fen2tdy,t1_fen0lke,1579275720.0,This sounds the most rational since I live in California and the first generation kids almost always tower over their parents. Kids overfed on junk are often malnourished. Many of the people on my 600lb life are malnourished inspite of the overeating.
fatlogic,femwebx,t3_eq0je2,1579271362.0,"Did we get shorter? When I was a kid in the 1990's it was 5'4"" and 140 pounds as the average woman in the US."
AskWomen,fehu6g1,t3_ep2ojr,1579123938.0,I used to wake him up but that's because I worked and he didn't.  Since I couldn't send him to work for me my sleep was more important.
confessions,feftvi4,t3_eorn1z,1579065044.0,"Don't worry about it, something like that makes you charming as long as you're not putting off work to bust a move."
AmItheAsshole,fe49z6w,t3_eno5q8,1578857196.0,"NTA, used to do that all the time when I was on the pill. It's his problem not yours. If he has such a problem knowing other people have sex then why go on a double date?"
AmItheAsshole,fe2w3cu,t3_engdkr,1578843473.0,"NTA, weddings are difficult because of the planning and the peripheral people making it about them. Joy was being a pain in the ass plain and simple. It makes me wonder if she was trying to frustrate OP to the point that OP would give up and allow her final say in the bridesmaid dresses. If it would have continued I'm sure Joy would have had a problem with the color and tried to change that too."
fatlogic,fe2svvy,t3_enn6kd,1578842479.0,Yay! Damned if you do and damned if you don't. Ultimate justification to avoid dating fat people.
childfree,fe2m64n,t1_fe0294i,1578840391.0,Would you make an announcement when it is translated into English? Looks like the entire community wants a copy.
childfree,fe08p89,t3_encogm,1578806134.0,This community is reassuring and makes me thankful for my unconventional family. Raised without religion so my family is very accepting.
childfree,fdtrvz6,t3_emzh2a,1578721240.0,So funny! You probably disturbed him more because he knows you as a straight man.
AmItheAsshole,fdthnq8,t3_emw6xl,1578716900.0,"NTA, this has happened over and over in the US. It is not economically viable to have a partner never work anymore in most countries. 

This is not normal behavior on her part. It's not like she's working more than 40 hours a week coming home to several little children.

Some women in the US, of a certain age, were raised expecting to be sponsored their whole life. My own mother was the same way and hated working while with my father. Now that they are divorced she has no problem working. 

Most people are flexible and willing to work with their partner when times get tough. It sounds like she may have married you for reasons other than love and now it's coming out. The manipulative tactics she's using are you are childish and terrifying. 

Keep your eyes open and protect yourself."
fatlogic,fdt1olp,t3_emszsq,1578710767.0,Sensitive much? How do these people get anything done if they are triggered by words like oversized?
Hypothyroidism,fdqh95n,t3_emmugo,1578666620.0,This is so reassuring. I always feel tired and it's comforting to know it's not laziness.
AskMen,fdhv6c0,t1_fdhsz3n,1578430720.0,I did and began using it but it was not enough. He only got better after he realized people thought he was homeless because of his clothes.
AskMen,fdhiaqi,t1_fdhdy04,1578423236.0,Is there a nice way to address this and ask for more hygiene?
AskMen,fdhg475,t1_fdhdy04,1578421915.0,"So well put, thank you for your response. Personally it felt disrespectful and like a red flag. Sounds like it isn't always a red flag but it still feels disrespectful."
AskMen,fdhfnl9,t1_fdhduc9,1578421647.0,"Not house clothes but all clothes he would wear out. Would even beg him to let me wash his clothes but would refuses because ""then they won't be soft"". That last comment was in reference to a pair of jeans that were visibly filthy."
childfree,fc70nh7,t3_egfxux,1577494384.0,Christ that's an obnoxious way to try to guilt your way into becoming a grand parent
AskWomen,fc6g12x,t3_eg7srq,1577479706.0,"I wasn't ugly but lived in a super small town and looked different enough that you could look at me and tell I wasn't from there. Until I was 18 had people tell me I would be pretty if I dyed my hair, wore blue contact lenses, and tanned. Basically I'd be pretty if I looked like I was related to everyone else. 

Fortunately this instilled a large amount of defiance and would respond about how I was beautiful and didn't need to. I'm still surprised when I'm told I'm pretty and I moved far enough away to be pretty."
fatlogic,fc4oms8,t3_eg4s63,1577422995.0,And I thought I was anxious
