I don’t really care whether innocent or guilty men die, I don’t even really care if I die. I’ve already been pronounced legally dead before, and none of it really seems to mean anything; everyone says life is supposed to have more meaning after that sort of experience, but I just can’t be bothered to care about any of it.

But I like what I do for work, so I’ll just keep doing that until I die."

optometry,ff4x6e3,t1_ff4wdh0,1579574587.0,"We did, and it would always get us at least closer than the OD’s original (sad). The issues we had were with high cyl, it would either push too much cyl in the case of high cyl myopes, or it would underprescribe cyl and offer funky axes to hyperopes.

I’ll never forget when we caught a clear cut low hyperope coming out with a -0.50 -0.50 x180 OU from the doc, and the EyeNetra gave them a +0.50 OU. Their actual was OD +0.25  OS +0.50. The doctors excuse was “Well then that’s the patients fault.”

It was at that moment I knew that place was doomed. I walked out on the job in the middle of a busy day on NYE 2018. Went across the street to the competition, who is without question among the best ODs I’ve ever met in the ten years I’ve been an optician. Very sad, the old doc will probably lose his business soon."

Ironically, we opticians in the optical department bought it because the doctor was a hack fraud who couldn’t perform a refraction. And we decided we would have some fun and see if the EyeNetra could beat him. Never had very good luck with the device. Have they been improved since then? I don’t work there anymore, so I don’t know what happened with the device."

news,fedrr6c,t1_febxl8c,1579018483.0,"Growing up, every other boy I knew killed and tortured animals. We’re talking a middle school class of like 120 boys total. Big school. Literally every kid that wanted to play after school actually wanted to rip limbs off bugs, set raccoons on fire, one kid drowned a cat in bleach and took polaroids with him and ten other friends drowning a cat in bleach.

I became best friends with the only two other boys my age who didn’t like hurting animals. We’re still best friends to this day.

I remember getting drunk and talking with the bleach kid in high school, and he said “Someday we’re going to have to kill, because the world requires men who are strong enough to kill, and it’s important to not have any more caring inside you when that time comes.”

Turns out that most of the boys who tortured animals in my class, growing up, were doing it on purpose so that they could stop having to feel. We grew up in an affluent area, but crime ridden. Most kids came from abusive families, many of them sexually abusive (when we grew up it turned out there were organized groups of pedophile families in the area). Today it’s overrun with heroin and human trafficking.

I live on the other side of the country now, but those two guys are still my best friends in this world. We’re the few who escaped."

However, this is ultimately a question for your doctor. They should be able to explain to you their reasoning. Why not just ask them directly?"

IMO, this just looks like some pronounced birefringence in the reflex color, could be due to more prevalent cyl in that eye alone. Can't tell from the photo, though. But yeah, failing to clean the lens before glazing is a huge red flag; if the QC is letting shit like this fly through, no telling what else is going on. Sadly I see more and more stuff like this coming from the insurance hub labs; lenses covered in swarf just getting thrown into a frame with no care for the final product.
