AskAnAmerican,ffabpr4,t1_ff91c21,1579731784.0,It was 10 years ago and the ruling basically declared that corporations and PACs actually have more rights than American citizens do in spending money on elections.
AskAnAmerican,ffabfbm,t1_ffa990t,1579731613.0,"That was a bullshit ruling because the question of the individual person losing their rights as a private citizen was not really what the case or the ramifications of the ruling were about.

The ruling was the first of many rulings to expand the idea of corporate personhood to include rights to free speech under the constitution to corporations themselves.

American citizens have limits to what they can directly give to a political campaign under the law.  That is considered perfectly constitutional and was in place long before CU and still is in effect today.

What the ruling essentially said was that if you want to get around campaign finance and election laws, you can just form a corporation and do it through them and you’re free to spend as much as you like in whatever way you like.

That includes foreign citizens, corporations, and even governments pumping money into campaigns “uncoordinated” with the candidate’s campaign (because those limits are still there for the campaign)."
AskAnAmerican,ffaaq3k,t1_ffa48ht,1579731206.0,"They can overturn a prior ruling.  Repeal specifically applies to legislation.

Since most of the same justices who ruled on Citizens United are still there and the court has moved to expand corporate power even more with recent appointments, it’s doubtful that Citizens United will be overturned any time soon.

The only ways to “repeal” it would be to pass new legislation through Congress consistent with the court’s opinions on what was wrong with the original campaign finance laws or pass a constitutional amendment banning “dark money” in elections."

Auburn was right behind us at #10.  Even Kentucky pulled in a top 15 class by their rankings.  SC is 20th.  Mississippi St. is 25th.  The only SEC schools I saw outside of their top 25 are Ole Miss (35th) and Vandy (51st).

If you want to look on the bright side of this, UT signed 1 five star (Bailey) and 12 four stars, giving us 13 elite players.  That's comparable to both A&M and Florida's 2 five star players and 13 four stars (15 elite players) and not too far behind LSU's 2 five stars and 14 four star players (16 elite players).  The only SEC teams who finished dramatically better than us on paper are Alabama (4 five stars and 18 four stars) and Georgia (5 five stars and 13 four stars).

IMO, while the five star players get all the attention, elite programs are built with lots of four star players.  The difference between a four star and a five star athlete is usually mostly hype and many, many five stars go bust or only perform as well as four stars ranked behind them  We did well.

The SEC teams lower than us, however, were significantly lower in top tier talent.  Auburn was ranked next after us nationally and had no 5\*s and only 11 four stars.  Kentucky pulled in a single five star player and only 9 four stars.  SC got a pair of five stars, but only 3 four stars.  Mississippi St. only had 4 four stars at the top of their class.

The USA should look out for the interests of its own citizens, rather than accelerating the process by openly favoring a well connected minority class.

After World War II, the USA controlled global manufacturing and agriculture.  This was a world where someone with only a HS education could get a factory job at 18 and start a family, buy a house, and buy a new car by the time he was 25, invest and work there for 40 years, then retire a millionaire without ever doing anything else.

Insurers grudgingly agreed to not kill the ACA through lobbying because of the individual mandate, but then the mandate was never enforced while the caps on their profits are supposed to be and they now have buyers' remorse.

One of the things insurance groups have been lobbying for is for the government to subsidize cheaper plans that don't cover as much as the ""Silver"" plans the ACA subsidizes via the exchanges.  We'll see what happens there, but Trump has voiced support for this in his attempts to ""repeal"" the ACA."
AskAnAmerican,ff20pna,t1_ff0pbxd,1579490698.0,"Only about 40% of American households have a gun in them.  Often, that's one person.

Most gun owners only have 1 or 2 that they use for either self defense, hunting/recreation or both.  In rural areas it's wise to have one as a tool because it may take the police an hour or more to get to you or there may be problem wildlife that needs to be dealt with (bears, coyotes, feral hogs, rattlesnakes, etc.).

There are gun owners who have concealed carry permits or open carry in the states that allow that, but they are in the minority.  I'm not sure what the exact numbers are.  I'd wager that it's less than 30% of all gun owners who do this, just based on my experience.

What really skews the numbers is that a fairly small number of gun collectors will own gun collections."
AskAnAmerican,ff2083m,t1_ff0tbei,1579490343.0,"Sort of.  The key difference here is that the hospital will send the ""customer"" bills for their service that they are legally responsible for.  It's just that a lot of those people have no way to pay for it, so taxpayers and other customers wind up footing the bill in a roundabout way.

It reminds me of a recent thread on here asking if people thought that a trans person should disclose their gender status early on in a date.  Everyone in the thread, including a quite a few trans people, chimed in to say that it's absolutely reasonable to expect that and that respectfully not wanting to date a trans person does not mean they are transphobic.

We've always had high income inequality, but the standard of living for the people in the middle class was so high relative to the rest of the world that nobody cared that much until now, where almost all growth in wealth and income is going to the top 0.1% and people are basically locked into the class they're born into."

AskAnAmerican,ff0uaoq,t1_ff0lex3,1579472381.0,"There are legit arguments on the right against raising wages, paying for higher education, and regulating businesses, though.  It's not just cruelty.

Regulation makes business harder and more expensive to conduct, which takes away from their profits and what they can pass on to shareholders and workers.

Higher education is seen as wasteful in most cases.  They don't want to subsidize a fine arts degree in Weaving or Dance with many thousands of taxpayer dollars.  If you want it, they feel you should be on your own to pay for it.  The emphasis on college as a requirement has also neglected the trades, preparing a lot of new college graduates with few marketable skills that stand out.

Raising wages has an inflationary effect.  When you raise minimum wage, it provides upward pressure on wages, but those costs get passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices.  It also makes some jobs simply not worth the salary they're being paid, so they get eliminated or automated out of existence.  This is why movie theatre ushers and full service gas station attendants don't exist anymore."
AskAnAmerican,ff0sj62,t1_ff0cfpd,1579471891.0,"The stuff you see on the news points out the bad aspects.  The most rabid, angry ranting lunatics are not really representative of the American right.

Trump's own support is only like 40% right now.  His real base is around 25% of the people and others simply go along with him because they like some aspects of his policies (like restricting immigration or standing up to China) and feel the ""good"" outweighs the ""bad.""

The American right is characterized by its distrust of the government (except for the military and police), strong protestant religious ties, and belief that people should be self reliant and respectful of tradition.  None of that is too awful.  They see it as part of the frontier mentality that made America the most powerful country in the world.

Massachusetts is almost a debtors' paradise.  Texas or Mississippi, not so much.

Our government does some things for poor people, but as I explained above, that's complex and it's often kind of shitty or has a lot of strings attached.

However, in terms of treating each other, Americans can be compassionate to their neighbors and people they know.  We donate a lot to charity.  Churches do a lot to feed poor people.  Etc.  Right now there are billboards and a lot of aid campaigns to raise money to help Australia recover from the wildfires.  We do that any time there's a great global tragedy.

There are some cultural differences.  The UK has a much more generous welfare system than the USA... but British people feel uncomfortable when an American walks down the street and casually smiles and nods ""hello"" to a stranger as they pass, or makes smalltalk with someone in line or on an elevator.  Here, those things are just considered pleasantries and good manners, especially out in the country.

Where I live, if your car breaks down on the side of the road, you can expect some stranger to pull up and freely offer to assist however they can.  If a local family loses their home in a fire or flood, people will get together and raise money to help them through dark times.  That's common.

America was founded on a distrust of the British government and we still have that streak in us, especially since Vietnam and Watergate, so we don't like to rely on the government to do things for us.  The current administration isn't doing the government's image any favors, either."
AskAnAmerican,ff0pj5y,t1_fezbk09,1579471060.0,"Such programs are out there, but they typically aren't well publicized and the paperwork/qualifications can be a complex nightmare, as each one is different and different states may set different criteria.  So a poor person may qualify for Medicaid to cover medical treatment in one state, but not in another.  It's all fragmented so you have to fill out forms for this program, then apply for that one, then apply for that one.

We are pretty ruthless in a lot of ways and a lot of people in power want to make us moreso.  Those programs are mostly on the books from the Great Depression or from the '60s when Democrats were trying to eradicate poverty while also fighting an expensive war in Vietnam.  It's generally hard to qualify for most of the assistance for poor people if you don't have children to support.

Doctors didn't like a lot of the requirements for them, either.

Big corporations do not like being required to offer insurance to full time employees.

States did not like being expected to expand Medicaid, so most red states didn't and now poor people are caught in a  trap where they're too broke to buy insurance but can't get Medicaid.

People who had ""cheap"" insurance before (even if it covered next to nothing) or didn't feel like they needed to buy insurance before the ACA didn't like that the law required them to buy it or made their premiums go up to subsidize older/sicker policy holders who are now insured.

Lots of very rich and powerful people gain if the ACA is gutted and they have spent a lot of money lobbying for that.

I've had severe depression my whole life.  In May I lost my job and with it, my career.  I can't find anything else here besides shitty dead end jobs for HS dropouts.  Things started going bad in my marriage and I have two kids, who I love with all my heart, to support.  My depression got to one of the lowest points I've ever been at, and I've thought about suicide almost daily since I was 8, except for a few brief periods where I was actually happy.

I started smoking weed a lot, which is something I never did at all when I was younger.  I love Christmas time, but even with two kids this year's didn't feel special.  I was so low that about 3 weeks ago I wrote a suicide note and had plans all worked out for how to do it, including price checking the stuff I'd need.

Well, last week I had my first therapy session, which I had to wait on for 3 weeks.  That turned out to just be filling out a bunch of paperwork an being told to come back in 3 more weeks for a 30 minute session where I'd actually get to talk.  I sank even lower after that and realized just how bad my weed habit had become from the way I answered the addiction questions.  I was hopeless and wanted to kill myself again.

However, in the past few days, things have looked up.  I had a job interview on Friday and got the job.  It's a low paying part-time job, but it's better than nothing and it could potentially get my foot in the door for something better down the road.  That felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders.  I also started reading *How to Stop Feeling So Damned Depressed: The No BS Guide for Men* by Jonas A Horwitz, where he described what I was going through so well that it made me rethink a lot of things.  It's been the only helpful book on depression I've ever read and some of the strategies are already helping me to take more control of my life.

depression,fefnecn,t1_fefi992,1579060122.0,"I feel like I'm responding to a younger version of myself...

The only actual book on depression that ever helped me was Jonas Horowitz' ""s ""How to Stop Feeling So Damned Depressed: The No BS Guide For Men.""  I'm not trying to shill the book and it was written for an older demographic, but it was good for me to understand what the fuck is going on and get some perspective.

He addresses both of these things head on in there.  The inability to focus, even when you want to (that's not just because of screentime--it's a symptom of severe depression), and also the constant need you feel to distract yourself with... whatever.  For some people it's screen time, for others it might be porn, or alcohol, or drugs, or partying, or whatever.  The biggest party animals and social butterflies I've ever known were usually just trying to keep themselves distracted.

One thing the author suggested in that book that helped me was to think of your depression like some entity that wants to control you--it's like being possessed.  And what that entity wants is to grow and feed like a cancer, which it does by leading you to respond in ways that actually make you more depressed long-term.  ""Take it easy on yourself...You need a break...Relax and zone out and just stop thinking about this shit for a while...you've had a rough day, so you should blow off more important concerns and treat yourself...You've got to fucking get away from this situation right now!.""  Etc.

It's an insidious trick, because it relieves stress in the moment, but the consequences of it will lead to more stress from avoiding things as they pile up and fall apart around you, which will lead to you feeling more depressed and miserable.  At least, that's how it always was for me.  Maybe I'm just talking out of my ass, and if so, I apologize.

If you see that same stuff going on in your life, look at those urges to distract yourself, or run away from whatever is frustrating you, or to just put stuff off for later... and see them as the parasitic mental problem you have (which is not your ""real"" un-depressed personality) basically trying to trick you into suffering more because that's what it wants.  That's what it needs to feed  It needs you to be miserable.  It needs to grow and become more powerful over you until it consumes you whole.

You have to fight back against it and say ""no"" and work to push through those thoughts, which can suck... but it's not nearly as hard if you recognize them for what they are and say ""nope, not going to listen to that right now.""  That's not saying ""suck it up.""  It's saying to be mindful of what the fuck is causing these specific thoughts to go on in your head right now and how that's influencing your actions, then choose to act in the ways you know will be better for you.

It's helped me make better decisions to keep my life on track instead of disintegrating into the shit show it used to inevitably always turn into when I was stressed and struggling just to not want to die for a minute.

Don't think it's just you, though.  That is part of being depressed.  When the depression improves, the focus improves.

Try talking to your teachers, counselors, or even a principal about this.  Just explain that you want to do your work and you're not trying to be lazy, but you're dealing with a lot of emotions right now and want to work something out, like shorter reading assignments or doing something else instead of homework.  I can't promise they'll go for it, but if you lay it out honestly and show them something worthwhile you can do instead, you might get someone to work with you."

If I could get back all the nights locked away in my bedroom going down some Google rabbit hole or watching porn to distract myself from the agony of being stuck in my life... God only knows where I could take things.  So many of what should have been the freest and most exciting years of my life...wasted.

Damn, I was trying to be hopeful here... but fuck if I can see a sliver lining other than possibly saying that the introversion responsible for experiencing deep and prolonged depression must also indicate you have some pretty badass untapped intellectual abilities that have been devoted to internally-imposed suffering, but first you'd have to manage and retrain yourself out of these negative thought patterns.

One of the most profound things I ever read was in a book written by a pimp (""Pimp"" by Iceberg Slim).  In one scene, he's explaining how, in prison, he was incarcerated with a convict philosopher who explained the secret to life to him.  I'm going to badly butcher the quote, but it goes like this:

""The man who can train himself to control his emotions is powerful.  Always be cold as ice when you're dealing with your emotions.  There's a movie screen in your head and you control what that movie screen shows.  Now, chumps will just let whatever silly stuff play on it.

About 5 years ago I was in about the same boat.  My old Honda Civic with 220k on it blew a head gasket and I had a 100 mile round trip commute to and from work.  I'd already blown what little savings I had put back just getting it repaired every couple of weeks to keep it running.  My credit was in the high 400 range after my mom died without any insurance and I had to max out my credit cards to pay for her care and funeral, sending me into default and bankruptcy on everything.

I was still able to find a (kind of shitty) car and get a loan--an '07 Pontiac G5 for $5,000.  I scraped together $500 and trade my old POS in on one for about $400 (the cost they got selling it for salvage).  I was paying 17% interest on it over 3 years... but I still got a car and was able to make things work.  I had other (more expensive) cars approved for rates closer to 25% over 5-6 years.

There are plenty of subprime lenders out that there that will loan you a few thousand bucks on a car with godawful credit because they like being able to charge exorbitant rates in return and dealers want to make a sale.  It's a shitty situation, but shop around and you can make it work.

povertyfinance,fdxplxj,t3_enaqug,1578771595.0,"Not comfortably, but you could survive in a lot of places.  A lot depends on where you’re going to be living

Save up and buy the car first.  Buy something cheap and reliable outright so you don’t have a payment.  For furniture, get your apartment first, then look at the cheapest thrift stores, roadside finds, flea markets, and friends/family’s old stuff.  You don’t need as much as you think—a mattress is the biggie (look for wholesale stores that sell new floor models for cheaper or sleep on an air mattress from Wal Mart for under $100) and it can rest on the floor, then you will probably want some drawers, a TV, and a lamp or two.  You can add other furniture little by little as you find affordable/free pieces.  Kitchen tables and matching livingroom or bedroom sets are completely unnecessary.  It’s not glamorous, but you can find a lot of useful stuff just thrown out if you hit up a college as people move out of the dorms in the spring.

Then focus on keeping your costs low.  Cook your own meals (Sunday night meal prep for the work week is good) and figure out cheap meal plans.  Oatmeal for breakfast is stupid cheap and eggs aren’t very expensive, either.  Sandwiches, bowls of soup, or leftovers for lunch are fine.  Dinners is where you should focus on to add variety.  You should be able to easily feed yourselves on $400/mo after taxes, especially if you commit to 1-2 cheap dinners a week (hamburger helper, taco kits, spaghetti, or salad are ideas) Budget for eating out like 1-4 times a month as a date night and make it count.

Be frugal about clothes and entertainment/“fun” expenses, too—those get a lot of young people in trouble.  A good internet connection is a must, but you don’t need cable TV or many streaming services.  You won’t be in position to go shopping and spending much very often, but you might be able to hit up a local band at the corner bar once in a while (especially since you can’t legally drink there) or visit museums, go hiking, or hang out at the park.

The big thing that will potentially make life harder are emergency expenses.  Car breaks down, someone needs to go to the doctor, one of you missed work or loses your job...  those can really blow up your finances.  Ideally, try to save like a $1,000 emergency fund as a cushion before you ever move out and put any extra money back into replenishing as soon as you dip into it.  Do not rely on credit cards!"
