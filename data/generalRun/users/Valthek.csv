Take the traditional ""sound the alarm"" clock. Sure, more segments obviously mean that the guards are jumpy and just about ready to tell the entire neighborhood. But that doesn't mean anything if the score is done before the last two ticks are added.   
  
I notice that a lot of player-facing clocks end up that way. I usually tick them up as appropriate for what's happening in the game, but with some (like alarm or reinforcements) it doesn't quite work, I feel."
worldnews,ffboiqy,t1_ffbjmyt,1579775785.0,"I highly doubt that would work. You'd get a slightly more diverse landscape, but power would rapidly consolidate into those that have the money for big-scale advertising campaigns, at which point the labels they use (Conservative, Liberal, Socialist, Authoritarian, Left, Right, etc) basically become the de-facto new parties.  
  
And it's only natural in a democratic environment. You win by getting more votes than the other guy and then you push your agenda through by getting more votes than your opponent. The reward structure (staying in power, gaining more power) and the methods of achieving these rewards are skewed so that certain strategies are optimal. The easiest stratagem is to form a coalition to support those agendas you want. And to keep that alive, you form a front against those who disagree with your politics and support those that do.   
  
I suspect that a far better way of getting politicians to break party lines would be to institute hard term limits and heavy restrictions on political involvement when term limits are up. If you know that after 10 years, your political career is gone, you're much more likely to be willing to upset your party and do what is right for the people who voted for you, rather than pandering so you can keep your seat for another decade."

InfinityTheGame,ff8yfau,t3_esaluf,1579700066.0,"Something to keep in mind when making that decision is that the Operation: X boxes always have an exclusive miniature for each faction, not available elsewhere (excluding eBay or split box sales). 
  
You can get the same unit elsewhere, but not in the same pose or with the same loadout. So if you're a sucker for playing WYSIWYG, then the operation set is a good deal. The terrain from Wildfire is also miles better and if I didn't have a pile of MDF terrain, I probably would've gotten a few more sets of it, that's how good it is.  
  
Finally, you might still be able to pick up a pre-order copy of Wildfire if you search local game stores or the internet, which would net you the sweet Hippolyta mini.     
  
Finally, if you actually want both armies, an operation box is typically about as expensive as two army starters combined, but has more minis and gets you additional dice and terrain.   
  
On the other hand, and I speak from experience, picking up the operation box tends to lead to faction bloat and with how complicated a game of infinity can get, learning a single faction is a lot easier than learning three.  
  
As for your side question, O-12 can field a few units from Aleph and vice-versa. Specifically, they can field Devas (though the selection of profiles is more limited), can field Daikini Tacbots and can use Yudbots as assistants for their Doctors/Engineers. Both factions can also use Hippolyta who's a myrmidon, I think. There are also a few mercenaries that overlap between the two factions.   
I do expect we'll be seeing a Bureau Toth (the bureau that keeps an eye on Aleph and other AI's) sectorial for O-12 at some point in the future and I expect them to make much more use of Aleph's units."

Criminals rarely, if ever, think about the punishment they'd suffer for their actions, they're too caught up in their crime. And when they do, the punishments are too abstract anyway.  
People can't properly conceptualize *""x years in jail""*, we're just not wired that way. Same with paying a fine, once you go over a certain value, it's no longer money but just numbers. Large numbers, sure, but just numbers. Same with a death penalty. Sure, they might die, but that doesn't really *mean* anything so long as they're alive and happy. And most people don't even think about death until they're gravely ill and might actually die.
  
And besides, they'll never get caught. After all, *they* are smarter or meaner or more bad-ass or any number of other justifications. They clearly have thought of something none of the other criminals have. Or maybe they're willing to go further or they think their connections will help them not get caught. Whatever justification they've made for themselves, they're sure they'll never get caught. And if they do, they'll get out from under the punishment.

TheExpanse,fdg97fz,t1_fdfctve,1578385444.0,"Fair point, I had forgotten that the Rocci (among others) has atmospheric capabilities based on the thrusters. I suppose the show, and it's depiction of in-atmosphere Epstein drive use, is to blame for that. I also vaguely recall them just using thrusters to get high enough that they can turn on their drive without slagging the ground beneath them, but that might just be me. 
  
Though, that said, for taking off from a planet, all you need is a sustained thrust higher than said planet's gravity. Even at half a G net acceleration, you're up in orbit in half an hour, so the values don't need to be that extreme. And Ilus IV/New Terra isn't a particularly dense planet, approximating earth's gravity. In our modern-day, we would want to get up there ASAP because fuel and thrust are really expensive, but that's not the case in the Expanse. You could probably make an argument for thrusters going up to 2 or 3 Gs worth of thrust, though that's likely not a fun experience for the components.  
  
Still, 3Gs isn't THAT much in the context of the confines of a space-ship. If you're being boarded, you're going to be locking off every compartment and venting atmosphere where possible to slow your attackers. That makes the areas in which boarders can move around a lot smaller. Barring any long corridors, they're at most going to be 'falling' across something like a galley or large room, so a fall of 5m or so. That's not exactly a pleasant experience, as you'll be smacking into a surface at ~60km/hr, but by no means is it going to be absolutely lethal to anyone in a sealed vac-suit. Unpleasant, yes. Hindering, absolutely. Cripling? probably not. But the same goes for your people, and some of them are going to be significantly less well-protected than your attackers.  

It's probably more likely to work than I initially thought, but all of the same problems still apply."

TheExpanse,fddmv7q,t3_ektmf9,1578318127.0,"The problem with that approach is that speed is the most important factor in boarding. If you can get to ops and engineering before the defenders can mount a defense, you usually win or turn the action into a phyric victory.  
If you want to (ab)use high-G maneuvers safely, everyone needs to get into their couches and get on the juice before you do. That's time the boarders have to waltz through your ship unimpeded and shoot or take hostage anyone strapped in.   
On a small ship, like the Rocci, where everyone is accounted for, it's an option. On a larger ship the minute+ delay basically means you lose.  
  
And that's not taking into account power armor used by boarders. Even old-gen power armor can take significantly more Gs than most people (see: Bobby's introduction in Caliban's war where she points out that anything that can crack her last gen armor would turn the user into paste). So even a 10-G maneuver might not be enough to deal with boarders who have secured themselves.  
  
If your opsec is good, strategic maneuvers during boarding, coordinated with your defense is a good way to gain an edge, but it won't kill boarders by itself without crippling your crew or your ability to mount a defense.  
  
Edit: I also forgot that in the expanse any real thrust is going to be along a single vector as the engine(s) are all mounted at the stern and pointed in the same direction, so you can only force your attackers into the 'floor'. I'm guessing maneuvering thrusters can't put out a lot of Gs, probably less than half a G, so it wouldn't really harm armored attackers."
belgium,fcyfegu,t1_fcx8521,1578079253.0,"You're actually missing the additional income made by leasing companies and car sales companies. If you kill company cars, I'm guessing that a lot of leasing companies are going to have to downsize or even close up shop. 
  
And if company cars go out the window, car sales are going to take a hit as well. Not nearly as much as leasing companies are going to, people still need to go places. But a leasing company is going to rotate through their entire stock in 2-3 years. A private individual who has to pay for the whole of their vehicle is going to hold on to it much longer.  
  
Plus, if an individual has to pay for their car themselves, they're going to have to squirrel away money to pay for it in the future, which is money with a very low velocity. That is money that doesn't do anything for a long time before being spent, and that's generally pretty bad for the economy."

A well-edited gif or perhaps a meme depicting a world leader as a villainous character would also fall in the upper end of the scale. 
The lower end of the scale would be things like two blue lines and a red dot on a piece of canvas or putting two lines of text on an image template.
