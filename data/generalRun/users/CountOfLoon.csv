OrthodoxChristianity,ffiawub,t1_ffi9pur,1579969510.0,"Can't tell if sarcasm or not haha. To me that truth is self evident, but if it wasn't sarcastic then ...yes, especially against Christianity. People will laugh at you or otherwise insult you for believing in God and if you're really lucky they'll call you a pedophile or something along those lines. (That's not even a joke, that's reality.)

But then again living in Belgium also means there are quite a few orthodox parishes around me, lots of orthodox christians immigrated here. So that's still nice I guess. Always look for that silver lining amiright."

OrthodoxChristianity,ffi6n6y,t1_ffi5zai,1579966487.0,"I can relate to OP in some way. Sometimes I wonder why I have never ever seen an orthodox priest trying to minister to other christians or even atheists, and I wondered if they are even interested in accepting converts (that question has now been answered, but I still understand why some may think that). Your explanation does sound reasonable and probably another reason for that is that I live in Belgium which is basically a godless place and religion is treated with hostility."

OrthodoxMemes,ff0992c,t1_ff068s5,1579466581.0,"Did you seriously just suggest my arguments are based on the same dirty tactics used by racists? my man... if anything is ""not very christ like"" it's throwing that bombshell at someone who is arguing in good faith. But ok, i'll let it slide, again.

I think some of the confusion stems from the difference of our understanding of christian unity. My ultimate vision of christian unity is both unity in organization and doctrine. Not merely tolerance of each others beliefs.

tolerance is obviously a value we should all strive towards but tolerance shouldn't mean we can no longer disagree on things and debate them. You seem to be suggesting that expressing dissatisfaction with the broad implications of Protestantism is somehow ""anti unity"". Can I not both vehemently disagree with what protestantism stands for and where it (as a broad movement) is leading many christians and at the same time recognize the love we owe each other as people who strive to follow the clearest directives of the gospel?

I also don't understand why you don't want to identify your denominational allegiance but okay. It just makes formulating precise arguments a lot harder for me... then again I guess that's the point of you not wanting to divulge that information. Because otherwise you wouldn't be able to make the ""you generalize protestantism"" argument. But please realize that you basically force me into generalizations BECAUSE you only want to identify as ""a protestant"" instead of being more precise.

So if you want me to stop generalizing then easiest thing would be for you to say what kind of protestant you are. Or don't. Your choice."
OrthodoxMemes,ff03rip,t1_ff00s1b,1579464837.0,"I made it clear that I recognize the diversity within protestantism and that one protestant can be almost the polar opposite of the other when it comes to beliefs... That's why I asked what kind of protestant you are, but you did not provide an answer.

Instead I get baseless accustions. All this talk about being ""not very christ like"" and this nonsense about accustations of Paganism just feels like bait to me.

I said no such things so I really don't have anything to respond to either. Only that those are some excellent strawmen. 

All that being said, the things I did say are still all true, they may not be YOUR protestantism. But it's still part of protestantism. Really an excellent example of my ""disunity"" argument."

OrthodoxChristianity,fen2l2n,t1_fen01jd,1579275571.0,"Then you and I...we're not all that different.

Except for the BPD (which is still a substantial difference and I'm so sorry you suffer from this) we share a lot of issues. 

I'm most effected by OCD and I just know how lost I would be without having had cognitive and behavioural therapy. It saved me, it didn't magically solve my problems but it made them manageable. So I feel a part of your pain. 

But again I would urge you to search for any well educated, understanding and trained therapist. They will understand you! They will help you!

No matter if they are Orthodox or not. That is irrelevant. To you it may seem like an essential detail but that's because the OCD won't allow you any rest from these doubts and obsessive thoughts. But What I've been told and have learned from experience is that the content of your obsessions are actually not all that important when it comes to therapy."
OrthodoxMemes,fen1n81,t1_femz7k2,1579274967.0,"""Church is thriving in China""

Meanwhile loads of the protestant denominations in the western world are trying to one up each other on how far they can wander away from the path set out by the gospel of Jesus Christ. All to pander and be tolerated by today's society and to be tolerated by people who don't even care about God in the first place. 

Yet you call the Orthodox Pharisees? 

Only ""unrest"" in the eastern Church is political and will never turn from ""hey I don't really agree with that decision"" to radical rejection of christian unity and ""hey guys Jesus really told me I need to get that private jet and BTW you'll never be able to buy that house you always wanted so just send your money to me and Jesus will magically summon a mansion for you and your family""

Or female priests, or disrespect of the Theotokos, or rejection of the Eucharist and a rejection of Apostolic succesion as the foundation of a united church. 

There is a reason there aren't a thousand and one denominations of Eastern Orthodoxy. Even the Schisms that did occur (With the Catholics and Oriental Orthodox) are not really that dramatic when it comes to theology

But for the sake of fairness, what kind of protestant are you? not all Protestants are equally misguided. I might be talking to an anglo-catholic , a unitarian or someone who attends a mega church.

When I study christianity to me there are only two legitimate options. Latin Catholicism or Orthodoxy. Protestantism is just an endless maze of confusion and disunity. 

Ya'll still believe in christ tho so that's cool"
OrthodoxChristianity,femzryq,t1_femz62k,1579273740.0,"Would you be willing to elaborate?

 If not then let me just say that an experienced therapist knows full well that religion plays a part in peoples lives and that this can also be a theme that manifests itself in mental health. I'm just worried that you are setting standards on what you think is good care but those standards are preventing you from getting care because the requirements you set are currently not available to you.

 Why not try another therapist who is not hostile to religion and will do everything he or she can do to help you?"
OrthodoxChristianity,femxvv6,t1_femx7wb,1579272438.0,"I'm sorry but why would your therapy, aimed to treat your mental health issues, require inclusion of specific religious beliefs or practices or require the therapist to share these beliefs? Will you be discussing theology with your therapist? Will he or she provide spiritual guidance? Therapy is the job of an educated therapist, and a priest dedicates his life to religious matters. I think it's best to keep the two world totally seperated"
OrthodoxMemes,femxeb6,t1_femolsa,1579272094.0,"But isn't it fair to say that holding on to tradition, whilst not perfect, is better than throwing it all out of the window and jumping ship (leaving the church).
