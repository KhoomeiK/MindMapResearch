stcatharinesON,feifvp6,t3_epbp9r,1579137569.0,"Well lets see. What is wrong with St. Catharines. 
No jobs
No housing
Horrendous bus system
People in local government who do study after study but no action
Huge drug problem
Huge amount of people who have NOTHING to do.
Thats a few.
Ive talked to a few people new to the city and they find it sketchy.
If u visit again the people are quite friendly but dont walk downtown at night or even during the day sometimes. Go to Port Dalhousie its nice"

Discussion,fdsca0m,t3_emv9an,1578699318.0,If I could change one thing it would be to go back and change my eating habits and lose weight when doc said that i was pre diabetic.

Also its a bigger city surrounded by an even  bigger city so lots of contacts to be made in the industry

diabetes,fcz6h2v,t3_ejn22a,1578094643.0,When I have a cold my sugar is way over the top like about 300 350. Almost no amount of insulin seems to work until the cold is gone. Which is why I hate getting sick and give people the evil eye if they come to work sick.

diabetes,fcyw71q,t3_ej9r4h,1578088421.0,Here in Canada I pay 72 at walmart for 100 strips 75 bucks for a 5 pack of fast acting insulin 138 bucks for long lasting. Yet they can give free needles for intravenous illegal drug users. It defies belief. Also I figured the strips cost more than a pack of smokes. Also although I have to pay for all of the above dialysis is covered under the provincial health plan. Really my mind boggles. Ideally they could offer the supplies at reduced cost providing preventative medicine rather than having to use a DIALYSIS MACHINE because you couldnt afford to manage your diabetes propely in the first place.
