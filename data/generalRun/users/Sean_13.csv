ArcherFX,ff8phak,t1_ff7y0qn,1579690406.0,I prefer Jerry to Cyril. Jerry might be a coward and bit dim but he's mostly not too bad. Cyril is kind of a dick.
gatesopencomeonin,ff62ot9,t1_ff6010x,1579617618.0,I would still think it wholesome. It would only change my opinion of the poster.
lgbt,ff5zju7,t1_ff58ajl,1579615208.0,This is the first time I have have felt proud of my sexuality. Bacon is the best one.
marvelstudios,ff2fjv9,t1_ff1vyze,1579504007.0,"I think his main concern was making sure Peter got back to earth safely.  I also think he didn't know how to get the nanobots, by the looks of it,  the satellite only works by sending something down that fully suits a person and he already had a suit. I also doubt he felt the need as he had a suit and he did not expect to be fighting Thanos.

I also think your theory played a big part in it and he simply didn't have any more nanobots. Or none that have been loaded into the satellite yet."
marvelstudios,fex4jqp,t1_fewlpb7,1579424209.0,My mind thought you said Valkyrie and Jessica Jones as a couple and I really liked the idea until I realised what you meant.

Nurse,fehrnj9,t3_ep70g4,1579122517.0,"I would probably say something like ""I know your name is X but can you confirm your previous name that we have on file so I know I have the correct patient."" Alternatively check surname, date of birth and maybe address if those first two isn't enough. 

Where I work now I've not had any trans patients but I have had plenty of patients that go by a vastly different name than what we have on file. It's easy enough, we have section above the bedside to write preferred name and I try to handover so the next staff know as well."

AskReddit,fegolqc,t3_ep1mtj,1579098826.0,Spend it trying to decide what to do with my 20 minutes.
AmItheAsshole,feg8dqd,t1_feg3xux,1579081926.0,"I think you're missing the point that this person is saying that there is a significant difference between what's public and private. Pissing and shitting is kept private, if you did in the streets it would be more than just frowned upon. Breast feeding is or rather should be allowed in public areas. 

But I think you have a point in that op has every right to be grossed out by the masturbation. I think the issue is it's no longer private if you are announcing what you are doing. If you jerk off, clean up and leave without telling anyone than no one else will know and you did privately do the deed."
lgbt,feewzs2,t1_feduu55,1579043038.0,"As someone who almost decided to do a pregnancy test on a 70 year old I can see this easily happening.  

Medical staff are humans and prone to mistakes and A and E especially is so fast paced. The doctors there are under so much pressure their may concern is to do some preliminary tests and make sure nothing serious or life threatening is happening. 

You being trans seems so irrelevant it's possible the doctors didn't register it or forgot about it, or it was probably listed under social history rather than medical. 

But anyone female and of childbearing age in A and E, we need to know of any pregnancy. So I could easily see a doctor think ""female of child bearing age I need to do a pregnancy test"" out of habit. I once went to check a patient's heels of bilateral below knee amputee for this same habit like thinking."

wholesomememes,fedl83s,t1_fedcz8t,1579014289.0,The top picture is how they view themselves. The bottom one is when they are going out and they realise how others view themselves and they grow self confidence and realise their self worth.

AskReddit,fdwbj9z,t1_fds4r84,1578757037.0,"I don't know about the passive aggressive. I think she was upfront with her feelings towards how Walt was acting and only became cold to him because he continued to lie or refused to explain. I feel she had legitimate cause to be upset with him from the start. The man she loves has cancer and he disappears for long periods of time without any explanation, and refuses to speak to her or open up at all. I feel her actions are justified."

AskReddit,fdrmgwi,t1_fdq39in,1578686599.0,I don't understand the hate for Skyler. The entire show is her telling Walt it's going to end badly and it did. She was just trying her best to protect her family against Walt.
memes,fdqcjf5,t1_fdq5j23,1578662989.0,"Not the case, bisexuals have always been attracted to non binary and trans (though straight/gay people can also be attracted to trans). Pans people don't feel bi full encapsulates their sexuality. One way I've heard the differences described was that Pans are gender blind and bi whilst can be attracted to all genders, feel attraction differently with different genders."

learnart,fczh8zp,t3_ejes1k,1578101210.0,"This is excellent work.  You did well with the facial structure it looks realistic but if you want to give the picture more depth try adding darker tones. Get the black areas really black. Use a 6b or softer. Also don't forget the midtones, around the face and in the shaded areas. Try editing your reference photo and making it black and white to make it more obvious what shade you are aiming for."
bisexual,fcx5lbj,t1_fcw5txt,1578052183.0,"I think we should have both those relevant to the plot and those that aren't. Straight people get both. Whilst it would be nice to have interesting well write and important characters, I think we need both types for fair representation and sometimes we are going to have poorly written characters like straight people do. 

That said I am disappointed they cut the bi scene with Valkyrie. They literally mention an orgy ship so implying sex with the same gender is mild in comparison. Especially when you compare it to guardians of the galaxy, where they have Quill having one night stands but his stay in the film presumably because they are straight."

todayilearned,fcuidv4,t1_fctzh2k,1577981680.0,Not lemonade. Anything ending -ade is a carbonated drink so none fizzy lemonade doesn't exist.  It would be like asking for a none fizzy coke.

BoJackHorseman,fc5ntv9,t3_eg5y9n,1577462286.0,This is amazing. I really want to do a BoJack drawing but I can't pick one scene or motif but I know I need to include this scene somehow.
nursing,fc5dgid,t3_eg6a7g,1577454229.0,"I've been in a similar situation with a HCA (a healthcare assistant, I assume the same thing as a CNA). She tried telling me that I should be filling in the food and fluid charts since I was in the room and she just started. I get that they are important but one, I couldn't even remember if I saw them eat let alone what they ate. Two, I've spent the last several shifts leaving half an hour late doing my paperwork so this set of paperwork is low on my priorities as its not the one I'm going to be sued over. Three I'm busy make sure no is dying, everyone's had their meds and everyone is pain free and right now that poor lady in bed 3 has not had any pain relief because I'm spending all my time hunting down doctors to prescribe them.

Its weird going from a student to a nurse. You go from one minute being treated like a HCA to managing a patient. Whilst you are not directly in charge of a HCA, you are in charge of everything to do with the pt which involves delegating to them for a lot of tasks. Which is a skill that I didn't learn as a student and I'm trying to learn now. 

That HCA/CNA you dealt with is wrong but it highlights how they view nurses. Its a difficult line to tread but I think it's important to make sure they are valued and respected but also that you delegate plenty of work to them to ensure you complete the essential tasks that can't be delegated. I try my best to sound appreciative, I will thank them every time and say ""brilliant, thank you"" if they inform me they have helped a pt. I apologise if I call them a lot with a short time frame but emphasise why I am e.g. I am so sorry but can you get a cammode for bed 1, I would have done it myself but pt in bed 3 is not looking very well and I need to recheck her blood pressure.

Of course there are times when this good nature might get abused which can depend on what type of person the HCA is which I think you need the more sterner approach but I've not quite worked how to do that, yet."

nursing,fc56m74,t1_fc4fnol,1577445881.0,"They are really weird because they will make out like nursing is the most undervalued profession when I think it's quite the opposite. Like, yeah I get it, there's plenty of demanding and ungrateful patients and family members. But if I say to complete strangers I am a nurse, they will express how much they respect me and the work I do."
nursing,fc566sz,t1_fc4qx5i,1577445258.0,I can find time but that's usually the extra 20-30 minutes I spend after my shift doing my writing because I didn't get the chance during the day.

I think it's important to clarify exactly what she said and is referring to."
