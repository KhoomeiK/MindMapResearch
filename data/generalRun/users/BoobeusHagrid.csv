She has quit taking naps for the most part, has started “mommy and me” preschool type thing with me, and is potty training. Do these new life milestones bring behavioral problems?? I’m a FTM so this is all new to me! She’s started talking back to us and straight up not listening even when she gets a time-out! Also still upset over the stinky behavior of my niece (as I mentioned in a previous post) even though I’ve distanced both of us from the problem. My OCD loves to latch onto things like that and imagine worst-case scenarios. :’( 

It has been a stressful week for me, some of the stress which is just my own mind overreacting to the problems."
thementalparent,ffeygwd,t3_et76o9,1579870400.0,Yes you should definitely mention it! That actually sounds a lot like my OCD ruminating thoughts when something triggers them. They cause physical anxious symptoms and make me feel like a prisoner in my own mind. I hope your therapist will have some insight as to what course of action will help you best! I did cognitive behavioral therapy and it helped me a lot.
bipolar,ffexvwl,t1_ffeqz4c,1579869830.0,"I had extreme irritability, and yet I felt energized. My thoughts became increasingly bizarre and eventually delusional and raced at 10000 mph. I was getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night and yet I felt like I didn’t need to sleep. A second voice inside my head became so real that it developed its own personality and identity. I began to believe it was the voice of my alien twin who was guiding me on a mission to save humankind. At the same time, I had frequent suicidal thoughts and felt empty inside. I wrote an entire book during this time and I wondered what the point of doing that was because life was meaningless and I couldn’t wait to escape the confines of planet earth. 

Anyway, taking Seroquel has brought me back to reality. Do any of those things sound like what you’re going through?"
bipolar,ffe3rhu,t3_esyqmk,1579835930.0,"You sound just like me! I was also diagnosed with OCD first, primarily the obsessions part. Therapy helped a lot until I started to notice other symptoms that seemed a little unrelated to my OCD. These symptoms got worse after I had a child and when I was finally diagnosed, the doctor thought I also had experienced a mixed episode and I was put on a low dose of Seroquel. It’s been awesome! My OCD symptoms and bipolar symptoms have been greatly alleviated. I was taking 25 mg and just moved up to 50 mg. It’s a game changer. Good luck to you! I hope it helps you too!"

For a while I wondered if perhaps I was gender fluid or something. Once I started taking antipsychotics, the voice disappeared. I actually felt lonely at first, like a big part of myself was gone.

I do think adoption is wonderful and a great option for anyone who doesn’t want to risk passing on any illnesses to their kids!

This might sound a little weird, but perhaps a house cleansing/blessing or smudging using a smudge stick made of sage or rosemary? These types of rituals are said to clear bad energy from the home. Even if you don’t believe in that type of thing, a lot can be said for the power of suggestion. Your son would feel comforted that you believe his fears and may believe himself that the “monsters” were driven away by the cleansing.

Something that stuck with me was what one of my past doctors said when I asked if I could manage this med free: “the older you get, the more the illness progresses and the harder it is to treat.” My advice would be since you’re young, do everything you can to get the right treatment. You’ll thank yourself later in life. I wasn’t diagnosed until I was 31 with a family.
