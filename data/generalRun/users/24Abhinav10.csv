Spiderman,ffo2g0w,t1_ffnoeig,1580073494.0,No I'm not saying that. Just that there is no need to CGI some of the stuff they CGI. Like the sign. I know lots of work goes into CGI but waste time and money when you can just get an actual sign?

AceAttorney,ffbhec3,t3_esclwj,1579765399.0,"It's because Ema likes Edgeworth so much.

Let me explain: In Ema's head, Edgeworth is the personification of an ideal prosecutor. He is ruthless in court, is always dead serious and prioritizes his prosecuting above everything else.

Compare this to Klavier who is easygoing in court, doesn't act serious and took a long break from prosecution because his music album became a hit. And only came back to court because he wanted to see the lawyer who defeated his brother.

There's also the fact that Ema didn't get her dream job and was likely forced to become Klavier's partner as Gumshoe was Edgeworth's."

Defenders,fe79shr,t1_fe785ds,1578911853.0,"Okay then, how about this? Spider-Sense can sense danger, yes. But it is up to Peter to react to them. It's up to him to recognize the threats so it can be fooled if he doesn't think he's in danger. He most likely didn't expect anyone to attack.

I mean come on, Spidey has dodged Electro's lightning blasts. It is very, and I mean very unlikely that Jessica Jones is faster than lightning."
Defenders,fe77ya0,t1_fe74rov,1578911136.0,I'd disagree on that. Spider-Sense also doesn't work if the attacker is someone close to Peter (someone he trusts or his friends).

Defenders,fe4zxlj,t1_fdpze10,1578864370.0,">Jessica Jones is fast enough to punch Spider-Man before the Spider-Sense kick in

After looking at that, I wouldn't say Jessica is fast enough. More like she took him by surprise. People have taken Spidey by surprise before. A more likely explanation is that Spider-Man was expecting Luke to attack, not Jessica, so he couldn't react fast enough.

Also, I'm really curious, what was Peter doing here?"

AceAttorney,fdw0mok,t3_en6s25,1578753758.0,"Let's see what I can remember:

1) The trial of each case can last a maximum of 3 days.

2) The Stature of Limitations of a case is 15 years. If 15 years pass, the case legally never happened.

3) The transfer of evidence takes place 10 years after the case from the Prosecutor's Office to the Police Department. (Not sure about this one)

4) No evidence is to be submitted without registration from the Police.

5) Evidence without police registration must be relevant to the case.

6) The Stature of Limitations does not pass for the time the person is travelling outside the country.

7) The duration of the Stature of Limitations does not start from the date of the incident but from the date the trial for that case ends.
