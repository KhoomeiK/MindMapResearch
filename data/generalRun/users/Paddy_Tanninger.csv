todayilearned,ffoda8r,t1_fflranf,1580076516.0,"I used to work in this really kind of odd studio that has started as a 20 person company and then grew and spread throughout various parts of the building up till the point that it was 200 people. We all worked in pretty small rooms just all over the place, and honestly I loved it. Everyone felt like they had a pretty cozy office space that they shared with only 10-15 other people, and you made good friends with all of them too. Multiple small kitchens and break rooms all over the place, there truly was nothing resembling the infrastructure that you'd expect from a 200 person company.

I was always stunned any time we'd do a company-wide screening or townhall type meeting where I'd think ""holy fuck, this is a huge company!"" When you were working in these small rooms with small groups of people you kind of forget and it feels like a more intimate 30-40 person operation.

Sadly they eventually left this building behind and got a single giant floor in a huge office tower that's an entirely open design with 20 foot ceilings."

Speaking from experience here, it's really not that hard to get two kids ready for school/daycare in the mornings, and make them dinner and do bedtime in the evenings. I do it all the time for my wife when she has to be away for work.

Even easier when your job is as lowkey and bullshit as Pam's job was over at DM...I mean she has almost zero work-stress there. No real deadlines, doesn't deal with clients or customers, and has a made up title of ""office manager"" for an office with barely a dozen people."
DunderMifflin,ffh6eq9,t1_ffgy3ki,1579924390.0,"She didn't even want to let him try. That's bullshit.

I watch my kids all the time so that my wife can attend medical conferences, study for exams, or even just service weeks where she's trapped on the ward until way into the evenings. I run a company too, it's not like I'm just a stay at home dad.

It's called sacrifice, and it's something that (especially this day and age) couples do for each other. Matter of fact of everyone I know with kids, I literally can't name any couples where they aren't trading off childcare duties to make sure their partners can succeed in their careers.

Pam has a dead simple 9-5 job that she basically can't get fired from. It's REALLY not that hard to make two kids breakfast and get them ready for school/daycare, and then make something decent for dinner and do baths, stories, and bedtime. I do it a lot for my wife, and she does it a lot for me.

DunderMifflin,ffh5bwt,t1_ffgzjgo,1579923536.0,"I don't think any of those seasons count, the writers were just making up drama for drama's sake.

They turn Jim into a moron in order to build up this ""tension"" and increase his stress levels, and they turn Pam into honestly a pretty unreasonable spouse to act as the catalyst for it.

Like...they wrote a scene where Jim can't figure out how to take an important phone call in the middle of a parking lot ***where his fucking car is parked which he could just use as a private phone booth.***

And there's absolutely no way that the Season 1-7 Pam character would have been so rigidly against Jim's attempt at making his dream job come true. Spouses make sacrifices for each other all the time to help their partner achieve success, because it benefits the entire family.

I was a solo-dad for a good chunk of 4 years while my wife was in residency...can you imagine if I said ""no sorry I'm not willing to even try taking the kids off your hands for 3 days a week so that you can study for a job that will help secure out family's future""? And now that my wife is a full staff doctor, she does the same in return for me so that I can take on bigger and more lucrative contracts with my company.

Pam had a dead simple 9-5 job that she could basically never get fired from. Speaking from personal experience here, it's REALLY not that hard to make breakfast and get two kids dressed and off to school/daycare before work, and to make dinner for them, hang out, and get them into bed.

However in the earlier seasons...Jim was actually super shitty to his girlfriends aside from Pam and was basically just stringing people along until he'd just kind of shut down on them.

Remember on Booze Cruise when he's there with Katie and just acting completely cold to her for no reason other than being bummed about Roy setting a wedding date? Katie's looking at Pam and Roy and asks him ""do you think that'll ever be us?"" and he just goes ""no.""

bestof,feqa0x6,t1_feoh6yz,1579339342.0,"Yep same here. This was in the early 00s so I'm lucky that the feelings I had never got weaponized against me.

I was a skinny nerd and a late bloomer too, I felt like I couldn't get any women to have a romantic interest in me.

Ended up somehow getting into shit like pick up artist literature where I was once again lucky, because my takeaway wasn't toxic. It was more along the lines of understanding that women don't respect a guy who puts them up on some imaginary pedestal.

But what really cured me was just going to the gym 4-5 days a week and putting in a lot of work bodybuilding and eating right.

At age 22 I was a shy and scrawny guy with a good sense of humor who women liked, but never had romantic feelings towards.

Then by age 23 I was looking like a comic book hero, my confidence was through the roof. Women who I'd known for years were now very interested in me, and I was meeting all kinds of new people too who were putting out some very strong vibes. Like it was to the point that one time this gorgeous girl in a bikini at a resort pool just walked up to me, introduced herself and handed me a paper with her room number on it.

But none of that personal growth is possible without you looking in the mirror and accepting this fact and saying ""the reason women aren't attracted to me, is because of me.""

Once you can do that, you can get to doing some hard work on yourself. You'll emerge as a new person on the other side. Not a different person, but a better version of yourself."
