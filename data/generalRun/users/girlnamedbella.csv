dating,fdr9nzq,t1_fdqskam,1578681443.0,"If I may add.. I’ve been on Tinder for maybe a week or two and then I had to delete it. Mostly because I was just overwhelmed because I simply cannot keep up with like 5 chats at the same time. Anyway, that’s not what I wanted to add. 
What I experienced on there was.. weird. Literally every dude was working out regularly or gym was a hobby, apparently they also were into surfing, finding themselves somewhere in Asia and sunglasses pictures. Don’t get me wrong, they’re probably nice people but it was soooo generic and boring. So I wanted to add that to your advice “a bit of research on what appeals to women in general”. Please don’t be like that and be yourself and stand out, OP! You’ll be an eye catcher!"
