Terraria,fgipkfq,t1_fgffxu1,1580827983.0,"There's a chance that there aren't that many valid spots for a bulb to spawn. Try building a flat area of jungle grass in the underground jungle, maybe just a tunnel with flat ground. Bulbs will spawn in there quite often due to there being so many valid spots there.

EDIT: You will have to go down and clear background objects though, because they take up spots where bulbs can spawn."
Terraria,fgipcc1,t1_fgibezw,1580827832.0,"Okay so I can't entirely understand your question, but I assume that you're trying to control your hallow and crimson. Your best bet is to rush to the mechanical bosses and get the clentaminator so you can clean out the majority of the hallow and crimson, as without it it's near impossible to just stop spread entirely. Once that's done however, simply place a bunch of pearlstone or pearlsand in a wooden box with 3 to 4 block wide walls and floor so that way the hallow can't spread into the stone or grass. If you need any more details, let me know."

handfetish,fg0x5co,t3_ets9ob,1580416761.0,"**my name is yoshikage kira. i am 33 years old.** My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."
