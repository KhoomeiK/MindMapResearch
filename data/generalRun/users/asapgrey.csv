worldofpvp,ff51lyr,t1_ff3y93m,1579577776.0,"Yeah, bfa is just a shit show.
Live long enough to see yourself become the villain, blizzard has.

It's time I stopped anyway.
Complexity was what kept me intrigued to the game. Even though legion was simplified, it wasn't as dumbed down as bfa. I literally fall asleep in bg, doing the same dmg rotation on everybody. Zero situational variance in dmg rotation.

Zero standards, clearly they sold out to satisfy the idiots and kids. Instead of implementing ways to  introduce basic principles of arena (like they do with pve shit), they just made a dh class that you actually face roll (nobody that is decent and has played for a long time can defend dh class). Then the removal skills and simplification of the game every expansion without fail... 

It's over, blizzard. You sold out too far."
