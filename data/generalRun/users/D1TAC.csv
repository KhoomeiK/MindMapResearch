Cylance,ffbxuuw,t1_ffbbjfl,1579786254.0,It would be interesting if it could inspect network traffic actually. Script control is amazing with OPTICS.

sonicwall,ff6y2rp,t1_fele7z8,1579637253.0,I second this. I'm having the same bug in the TZ600 on the latest firmware.

cats,ff3bipq,t1_ff37tuh,1579537929.0,It's definitely hard to know what is good and bad. I feel like Vets and people have different opinions. It makes it hard..

1Password,ff1nn0b,t3_er4scs,1579482184.0,"Yes I experience slowness as well, even had it crash one or two times.

Ends up being about the same speed."
