Usually test accounts have certain provilages that cannot be given to the customer. Just a wild guess. (Although, it's really bad by design)"
drums,fc33huw,t1_fc32vux,1577380569.0,"Once I got tinnitus I started using thunderplugs and earmuffs. Weirdly my T used to get worse for 20-30 minutes after playing but never suffered any permanent increase. I relocated because of my job and sold my acoustic kit and bought an electronic kit. 

I either output the kit on speakers or use my headphones. Fortunately, now I don't have any problem in living with T and I'm really looking forward to going back to an acoustic kit in the future. It's just my hypochondria that gets in the way!"
