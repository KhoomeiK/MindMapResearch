MurderedByWords,ffmoyn5,t1_ffmo259,1580057381.0,"Oh yeah, ever since Reagan they figured out that the actual president doesn't need to do anything, just act as a ceremonial figurehead to sign shit. Since then, populism has factored more into voting trends than actual ability, because you don't need to have a competent president to keep the empire running."
MurderedByWords,ffmbyrt,t1_fflwnsy,1580052095.0,"Propagandhi said it best: 


""'Yeah, you can vote however the fuck you want, but power still calls all the shots. And believe it or not, even if (real) democracy broke loose, power could/would just “make the economy scream” until we vote responsibly.'"""
microgrowery,ffii15c,t1_ffh2be6,1579974351.0,"No bait! I work at an OPS and suggest this to all my growing buddies,  it's a solid method for nutrient measuring."
microgrowery,fff8qtg,t1_fff0l59,1579878519.0,"Lol, you won't look like a smack head if you're not addicted to opiates mate. We have a large range of people accessing our service that need syringes - Diabetics, testosterone users, etc."
microgrowery,fff8m2a,t1_fff6k2o,1579878428.0,"The 3ml and 5ml barrels are not used by IV drug users as they are massively too big for their specific needs.  They use syringes in the 27-30 gauge range and the tips are never longer than 1/2"" (usually 5/16""). All those syringes are 1cc (1ml).

The large syringes are used for intra-muscular injection of Naloxone, and the large bore needles (18g) are used for drawing up the NX, and discarded for a smaller (22g) tip to be used for the actual injection into the muscle.  

You won't be reducing anyone's access to syringes :)."
microgrowery,ffebi6q,t1_ffeb8g8,1579842166.0,Why thank you!
microgrowery,ffeb7e7,t1_ffeb2dd,1579841900.0,"Thanks Man, I assumed that was what they were referring to, but wanted clarification.  Happy growing!"
microgrowery,ffeayho,t1_ffead2p,1579841677.0,"The site I work at distributes 12,000 syringes a month, so a gardener using 3 over a 6-month span is nothing at all.  I have been using the same syringe and needle for the last 6 plants, so it's a trivial amount in the grand scheme of things."
microgrowery,ffe2cl0,t1_ffe1zy7,1579834881.0,In what sense?
microgrowery,ffe1250,t1_ffdzm1o,1579833942.0,"Yeah, I could do that I guess,  but I use GO nutes and it smells like rotten fish, so any opportunity to reduce spillage or leakage is one I'm going to take."
microgrowery,ffdyb00,t1_ffdrdvq,1579831950.0,"Yeah, you can go the amazon route fer' sure, but if you have an NX in your town then it's all free."
microgrowery,ffdy8sr,t1_ffdsyqn,1579831906.0,I try to avoid any method that involves pouring from a 1 quart container into something as small as a teaspoon.  The syringe method works better because you can pull an exact volume of nutrients for your volume of water.  I can add exactly 1.36ml of nutes if i am using a litre of water. it's way more accurate.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fezlxbk,t1_fezan1y,1579458810.0,"Also, the car is going the wrong way in that lane.  He's ""wasn't causing harm"" DRIVING THE WRONG WAY UP A STREET!"
canada,fezb1zu,t1_fez6vw1,1579455551.0,"Exactly, those who I know that smoke the most weed are spending roughly $120/month on the black market for a half oz or whatever.  They're consuming about .5g/day.  That's the *upper limit* of the rec market.  If we are super generous and say that they smoke $200 a month, that's less than the average canadian spends on alcohol in any given month, I reckon.  Hell, to stock the bar appropriately for my family coming over for Christmas was $350.  The reality is that people will spend a lot more on alcohol each month that they will on cannabis.  The everyday smoker is spending less per month that the casual drinker, and the everyday smoker is a fraction of the population.  There never was, and never will be, the demand for cannabis that investors initially anticipated.  They have these massive facilities thinking that they'll sell all this weed, and then never thought to look at what the end consumer actually wanted, and how they wanted to get it.  It's no wonder that they all lost money on the stocks, the person in the article says the bought it on Oct. 20, 2018 *right after legalization when stocks were at their utmost highest*, that sounds like bad decision-making to me."

microgrowery,fdsafjj,t3_emr6kn,1578698073.0,Make sure you let it fully dry before sealing it up to cure.  I lost 56g of fresh frozen hash to mould when I forgot to vent it and went away for a week. Keep an eye on it!!!
