AmItheAsshole,fffnjgp,t1_fffjkow,1579887783.0,What is 51/50? I have never heard this before. Does it mean section (commit)?
AskAnAmerican,ff7iu0c,t1_ff6j8b1,1579650561.0,"Yeah, can't speak for the rest of Europe, but over fairly recent years drink driving has been successfully rendered taboo in the UK. When I was a kid, if you drank and drove, you were seen as irresponsible. My mum would say 'it's Friday night so watch out for drink drivers' like they were an unfortunate fact of life. Now it most circles it would make you a pariah. I go out a fair bit and I've only been aware of one instance of someone driving home drunk. It was a woman in her early 50s, and my gf and I who were mid 20s at the time were utterly shocked when we heard that's what she had done. Don't know if ages are relevant but there's a possibility it's partly generational."
WTF,ff4gxk3,t3_erhb38,1579563344.0,This is what we all tell ourselves we'd manage to if a car was about to hit us

Even if the wife is being unreasonable in the first place, responding by locking yourself in a room with the child so she can't get in is weird/concerning/upsetting. It's inevitable that the other parent would react in an emotional way."
aww,fey3jst,t1_fey3j1w,1579440331.0,Nor did I!
aww,fey3j1w,t1_fey3igl,1579440322.0,Me neither
aww,fey3igl,t1_fexsq1m,1579440315.0,Wow I did not notice that
AskABrit,feqawmd,t3_eq9r6o,1579339579.0,"One of my local pubs is from Tudor times. It's actually a bit of a shite hole and the kind of place you avoid unless you're after a really cheap night, but I was sitting outside it once in the summer and suddenly thought 'hang on, this building is gorgeous'. I hadn't even really considered before whether it was mock Tudor or real, but it's real. 

Also I don't live far from Windsor, and obviously there's the castle, which was built in the 11th century, (and began by William the Conqueror no less). And I've been in more than one pub there that feels very very old. Cosy places down cobbled alleyways that feel like something out of Diagon Alley."
