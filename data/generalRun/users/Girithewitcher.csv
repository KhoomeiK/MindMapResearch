Maybe the driver had really bad day like we all have. Like this, he is late to job that he might lose it and gets arrested by the police. How bad does it get? Cyclist said he was stubborn so i also think that he would go to court with this evidence easy and won. So why put your life in danger like this? I am not on the drivers side at all. That is dangerous stuff he did, but things could have escalated here pretty fast."

Mavericks,fdne7h0,t3_em8k14,1578583909.0,"NBA refs are making it hard for us to determine how they officiate NBA game. I mean, ok, I get it... when there is a ball and a hand on a blocked shot its mainly not a foul, but sometimes it is. LeBron playing handball with 3,4,5 steps and sometimes they call it sometimes they don’t. Rookie makes one extra step. Its a travel. Giannis winning his MVP on “gathering” step and refs just look trough it. KD last year went out of bound and we ALL, literally EVERY single human being saw him stepping out bound and refs look through it. If Harden hadn’t made that 3 idk what would happened bcs blind person would see that call. Then again we are coming back to Doncic reffing. He gets some easy and 1 calls and doesn’t get called on hard fouls. Kemba getting ejected for complaining about the call and we all know it was a fouls on Aldridge. NBA is getting bigger and bigger but refs are destroying it and we fans just go along with it. Idk anymore. Refs soft af"
