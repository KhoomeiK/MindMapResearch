Say wut? Michael went out with cervical chord injury. The part about shit philly fans celebrating the injury, that part is true."
fatlogic,fcxivyf,t1_fcwfwod,1578064043.0,I so greatly appreciate what you do.
fatlogic,fcxiezs,t1_fcx6hkw,1578063712.0,"Yeah, I feel the exact same way"
fatlogic,fcwdvw9,t1_fcwdbgj,1578023156.0,üëç thanks. Spent a lot of time in those beds. My only time seeing them was in ICU or transplant floors.
kidneydisease,fcwd470,t1_fcoii13,1578022635.0,"I‚Äôve had issues w/ fistula, graft, caths, etc. turns horrifically red, swollen, becomes very painful, and no amount scratching will bring relief. It was all due to the adhesives used, taped included. I found out that I‚Äôm highly allergic to having these methods used. It was causing a chemical burn to wherever it was applied."
fatlogic,fcwb78g,t1_fcvxk8s,1578021371.0,"Just finished last dialysis 4-5 months ago. After seeing the new dialysis patients come in, their desire to live mostly weighed the need to feel oppressed. And the ones that constantly skip or blow off the treatments somehow quit coming in. Well, their mental illness killed them.

Practice your insane philosophy all the way to your deathbed, so brave! We‚Äôll all miss you."
fatlogic,fcwabz9,t1_fcw676f,1578020793.0,Aren‚Äôt these the ICU or Longterm beds?

MensRights,fcvgcvj,t1_fcvagp0,1578001519.0,"While your pain threshold has increased over time, your ability to heal hasn't. Consider that in your adult years, the skeletal system has been fully developed. Your body now couldn't handle the stress caused during birth. Fully developed skeletal system will normally occur between 13-18. So it's not a black and white scenario.

On the other hand, circumcision **IS** systemic torture."
cowboys,fcoib2k,t1_fco0cpk,1577832909.0,Didn't they have the D as an established 4-3 (and drafted accordingly) and then make the switch 3-4? Or maybe the other way around?
TumblrInAction,fclvuzn,t1_fclixcd,1577757724.0,"Do you know how you got that dent, in your top lip? Way back, before you were born, I told you a secret, then I put my finger there and I said ""Shhhhh!"""
cowboys,fcltlgv,t1_fcloy8p,1577756149.0,I think you under estimate the number of fans that wanted the loss just to ensure JG hits the freaking bricks next week.
