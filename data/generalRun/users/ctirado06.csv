depression,ffabexm,t3_esbfsf,1579731607.0,"I haven’t gotten past the first few sentences, and already it doesn’t make sense to kill yourself. You’re trying to figure out how to tell your friends? That means you have a reason to live. You care enough about people (that I assume also care for you) to let them know, then you care enough to not do it. Stay strong. Talk it out and deal with the bullshit that is existence with the rest of us. It’s never worth it."

depression,fekbimj,t1_feigjmj,1579196591.0,That might be the hardest part about it then. Trying to believe you are worth staying alive.
depression,fehj3li,t1_fegykiu,1579117578.0,"“That’s the weird thing about life. If you could’ve killed yourself but didn’t, maybe there IS something you’re meant to be doing. Just gotta figure out what it is.” Someone told this to me a few years back and it’s kinda kept me from trying to kill myself since."
depression,feccm96,t1_fec306v,1578970796.0,"For the last month I’ve felt lost. I know what I have to do to become a “better person” I just don’t know if I can actually do it AND keep up with everything else I’m responsible for (being a good husband/father, school, work, va appointments). There’s so much on my plate, and the last thing I feel that I’m allowed to work on is my mental health. So it always ends up on the back burner. And when I finally get a chance to stop and take a breath it hits me, but there’s only enough time for the one breath. So I don’t have a chance to get better and actually focus on me. How can I talk about it, especially to my wife? She’s dealing with her own demons, and I try to help her out with them as often as I can. Which leaves less time for me to focus on mine. I’m still struggling to cope with my PTSD. That’s the main problem I have. My mind races with a million “what if’s” everyday. Constantly going through the worst possible outcomes of every situation I go through daily. I’ll be sitting in my office working and it’s like, what if someone breaks in through the front door, or the back door, starts shooting in the direction of my house, what if one of my kids slips and cracks their head open, chokes on a cracker, etc. And for every one of those scenarios, there’s dozens of possible outcomes. Each one I feel that I HAVE to have a plan for. I wish I could just stop these thoughts but I can’t. They consume me. And when I think to myself, “you don’t have to have a plan for anything of this”, then my mind goes into detail of what will happen if I’m not prepared for anything and I’m back at it again."
depression,fec2ckb,t1_febysum,1578965640.0,I think it may just be easier to talk about it on here. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s the absence of the direct human interaction. Which is weird for me because I don’t have a problem talking with people. But I find it impossible to talk about everything that’s been bothering me for years.
