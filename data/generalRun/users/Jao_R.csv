As long as there's safeguards put in, it won't be any different than what the government already has on us. We already allow our info to be collected on passports, driver's license, social security. As long as the same safeguards are put in, what's the difference? We can mask the data by just linking the ID to an encrypted key and only the encrypted key will be sent to social media platforms. They still can't access our data. Just the key which can be used to identify the individual using the account. Which can only be accessed with a court order.

Once accounts are connected to real live people, malicious activity will decrease. Not eliminated since there will still be stupid people who'll break the law even if they can be traced.

You could also write a series on a tax collector character. Just short stories about his adventures roaming the land trying to collect tax.

Lol. I think having nothing to watch on TV contributed to Marcos' downfall. The people were bitchy their entertainment was cut. Modern states nowadays realized there are far effective ways of subduing the public. Utmost of which is bread and circuses.

>Noblebright fantasy has at least one important character with noble,  idealistic motives who does the right thing out of principle. The  character is flawed, but his or her actions are generally defined by  honesty, integrity, sacrifice, love, and kindness. The story upholds the  goodness of the character; the character’s good qualities are not held  up as naiveté, cluelessness, or stupidity, but rather shown to be  worthwhile. Good characters can make a difference. Noblebright  characters can learn and grow. They can deliberately choose to be kind  when tempted to be unkind, they can choose generosity when it hurts, and  they can influence their world and other characters for the better. In a  noblebright story, even villains are not without hope; their stories  may have a redemptive ending, or they may have some kind of conversion  experience (religious or not). It’s not guaranteed, of course, but in a  noblebright story, it’s a possibility.  
>  
>Noblebright fantasy is not utopian fiction. The world of a  noblebright story is not perfect, and indeed can sometimes be quite  dark. Actions have consequences, and even good characters can make  terrible mistakes. But a noblebright story is generally hopeful in tone,  even if there are plenty of bad, grim, dark things going on in the  world.

[Misty Mountains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pyy_FIYE7EE) and [Blunt the Knives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JBHPFiFWRk) are my favorites. GOT has also produced one [haunting song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTa1jHk1Lxc) amidst it's disastrous last season.

And this [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dhfKp7MX2k) by the Rogue Valley, though not from a fantasy film, evokes fantasy vibes."

Fantasy,fdq81rg,t1_fdq6xjt,1578658735.0,"I don't even realize the reading anymore. It's just like my eyes going through the book and a movie playing inside my mind. The reading is unconscious and the imagining is what's active. The words disappear. It's just pictures moving inside my mind. When it's not action words but rather emotions that are being described, those emotions are triggered in my mind. idk how to describe it.
That's why reading is so immersive for me. I go out of every reading experience as if I've lived so many lives and for such a long time. The nearest I could describe it is like rising out of a long dream sleep. It's especially immersive when the story spans decades and millenia. You go into it deeply and you come out a changed man. And because most of my reading is done in a day, I retain information better and can follow the storyline accurately. I don't need to go back to where I left off and prime my brain to recall what I read before.
So reading for me is just like watching a movie. A four or eight hour movie."
Fantasy,fdq6g3q,t1_fdq5gm4,1578656925.0,"I don't know. It just came naturally to me. As I grew older, I realized most people aren't like me when reading. That's when I noticed they read differently. The slowest reader reads out loud or mouths the words inside their heads. The faster readers subvocalize. The fastest, like me, skip the subvocalization. We just read the words like we're drinking it. There's no need to assemble the letters to form the words. The words are taken in by bulk. There's no need to translate the letters into separate letters to form words that have meanings.

One trick I definitely do though, when I want to be faster (faster than my normal) is to skip articles (a, an, the) and zoom in to keywords. Most of what I do is unconscious though."
