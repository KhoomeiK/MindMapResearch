Right now the best time for me to work is in the evenings in my PJs sitting on my couch with a blanket on me and a lit candle. Heating is expensive! On the other hand, I'm at the office sitting in the dark today and I'm getting so much done because no one is here and the dark is cozy."

For a company, go to their website and look at their Careers page. Take whatever is listed with a grain of salt, but it might give you a good idea about what industry is looking for.

For a person, learn more about them. If they are working on an academic lab, you might be able to contact the lab and chat with someone who works there about what they do, what background they find valuable, and what advice they'd give to someone considering that career path."

There are so many ways to think about breaks aside from ""this is time I should be working"" - ""you can't pour from an empty cup"", ""put on your own oxygen mask before helping others"", etc. If your phone ran out of battery, you would give it time to recharge.

GradSchool,fdpgt40,t3_eml7ek,1578628241.0,"You have options

1. Master out via a MS defense (required by the program), get approved for 2 year leave, and decide later whether to come back
2. Take leave for an internship and return in the fall.
3. Take leave for an internship, decide to master out instead of fully returning, and ???

In all 3 cases, the programs didn't want to let the students go, because they were afraid the students would not return. 

My friend who chose option 1 is not returning. 

I did option 2, worked with my department closely to figure out leave, etc., and came back 4 months later. I continued to work part time as an intern until 8 months ago, because I wanted more time to devote to research. Mastering out was a really tempting option - regular hours and good pay are quite compelling.

Another friend did option 3. They're working full time but are academically still in limbo, I believe.astering out from a lab in one school and a training program in a different school seems to be more complex than they anticipated.

Edit: I should note that I am due to defend this semester and am planning to go into industry, not academia."
