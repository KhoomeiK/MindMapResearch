Showerthoughts,ffe0l7t,t1_ffdy6v3,1579833599.0,I would do that. It's even more fun drunk cleaning someone else's place.
Showerthoughts,ffe0h1a,t1_ffdv9my,1579833514.0,I have to take those screws out to take the bottom off of the vacuum to get to the roller and cut my hair off the roller. Otherwise it stops rolling and will burn up the belt.
Showerthoughts,ffe09o9,t1_ffdqanm,1579833368.0,"Definitely need some drinks to groom my dog. It's such a process and it kills my back, but drunk me is cool with it."
Showerthoughts,ffe060w,t1_ffdu3ut,1579833297.0,Especially waking up the next day and your house is all clean and shiny and you keep finding little extra touches drunk you did for sober you.
Showerthoughts,ffdzrwj,t1_ffds3nc,1579833012.0,Sober me thinks that.

Showerthoughts,ffdq3mb,t1_ffdmzyz,1579826254.0,Lol just that bottom part. I have waist length hair and I have to take my vacuum apart about every other month and cut all my hair off the roller.

Showerthoughts,ffcz46a,t3_esxw00,1579810240.0,"I drink at home alone, but I save up cleaning jobs I don't want to do when I'm sober and do them when i drink. Last night I took apart my vacuum, cleaned it and put it back together, then I cleaned my entire area rug by hand. I usually deep clean the whole kitchen and make some food for sober me for the next day."
unpopularopinion,ffbgx7l,t1_ffbbcra,1579764788.0,"Females can easily fake them and most guys would never know the difference. I've met many females who have never had an orgasm, so they fake being satisfied so that their man feels more masculine (for the lack of a better word).  It does go both ways, the how and why is a lot more complicated."
unpopularopinion,ffbg7ma,t1_ffbg2mw,1579763894.0,"My bad, there was a comment by someone else in this thread who asked about that."
unpopularopinion,ffbfssi,t1_ffbfp4t,1579763385.0,Same. Are you wanting to know why/how women or men fake orgasms?
