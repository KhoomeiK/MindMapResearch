AirForce,ffhkclf,t1_ffhh146,1579939259.0,"The one at Lackland a few years ago was hilarious, a bunch of top three replying to all to say ""please remove me from this."" Still getting the emails two days later wasn't so funny."
AirForce,ffhgi3w,t3_etlsef,1579934237.0,"What was the deal with that? I got 4 of those stupid emails in a row and started thinking I got tasked where my UDM failed to let me know, yet again."
smashbros,ffgzp9l,t1_ffgywca,1579919229.0,"I highly doubt that. With his subscriber numbers on YouTube, I wouldn't be surprised if he hits a million subs this year, and almost all of his videos have 300k+ views. He also got a solid sponsorship from Facebook to stream on their platform, and mentioned in one of his Q&A videos that he helps support his Mom, so he's doing much better for himself money-wise than he was at the beginning of his Sm4sh days."

6 years of working 3 different shifts every week later: ""Do I hate my life? Yes, but I can buy fighters passes with the money I earn with blood, sweat, and tears, so I got that going for me, which is nice."""
AirForce,fffqv8f,t1_fffqc69,1579889829.0,"""What?! You want to spend your small amount of downtime hanging out with coworkers or talking to your family, and not handing out cupcakes at the USO?! How dare you Airmen, 14 hour (which usually turned into 16 hour) days and you can't give two hours of your 6 hours off to them?"""
AirForce,fffj1cp,t1_fffibwu,1579885016.0,"That was the point when my E3 virginity was taken from me, realizing not only did they have the audacity to set up volunteer ""opportunities"" while deployed to a combat zone, but having leadership that expected us to take part in them. Nah son, I'm gonna work for 14 hours, eat some plastic ass tasting chow hall food, skype my family and pass out."
smashbros,ffcv7vm,t1_ffbzrlh,1579807949.0,"Now that would be fun! Only problem I see is with the switch's hardware running it, sometimes it takes a few seconds to load in my next character with just two of us playing it with my roomate either dash dancing around by himself, or charging something lol."
smashbros,ffblpmq,t1_ffb7fzf,1579771504.0,"Please this, I love squad strike so much, and it pains me that I only get to truly enjoy it on weekends where I can get multiple people over to play it."
smashbros,ffbl990,t3_esnci1,1579770810.0,"I really hope when it's fully complete, it ""accidentally gets leaked."" This looks fun, and I'm sick of Nintendo's shitassery when it comes to mods and fangames. They could stand to learn a thing or two from companies to not only encourage mods, but have mod support within their games."
