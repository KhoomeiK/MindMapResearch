Many people of reasonable understanding can infer and agree with that statement. They are also not leaving out ""countless"" countries becuase they are stating a fact of the matter. The US IS the current superpower. You are framing their arguement in unreasonable absolutes just so you can say they are using a fallacy.

Otherwise every arguement on every subject is a black or white fallacy becuase one person cannot argue for every tangental of an arguement. You are just arguing to infinitum at that point becuase if there are countless other countries then it is unreasonable to expect anyone or any group to use each of the counltess as an object in an arguement.

Reason being is you are actively upset about the thought of hearing the anthem and saying the pledge; so much so that the thought of hearing it unassociated with a governmental proceeding elicits a “Fuck No” from you, That’s not some assumption I have about you. I want to highlight exactly how visceral your responses have been...  

> A random basketball or football game in November or March? Fuck no.  

Why “Fuck no”? Typically, strong words mean strong emotions

> you've been brainwashed  

Personal attack after only 20 words from you counter.

> couldn't even be bothered to constructively conisder the point I was trying to make.  

Your point so far is that I am brainwashed and you are not because you are mad you have to listen and stand still. The thought of it taking more of your day appears to anger you because there is no need. Yet we do many things that are not needed, mainly because those things are not a big deal. 

> such ignorance and lack of critical thinking skills  

I could say the same but I won’t. My assumption will be that you are emotionally distressed and that your processing of those emotions are causing you to lash out at a random stranger over a song and a piece of cloth.
 
You however are swearing, forcing words and generally speaking… pissed off about it. All this over a piece of cloth and a song. I’m not trolling you. I am pointing out that its not that big of a deal. The average time it takes to sing the anthem is just under 2 minutes, connects more people than it divides and for the most part has been used as a unifying piece for the past 89 years. Really, its only contrarians that are making a big stink about it.  

I finished school; I don't watch sports and my time in the Marine Corps. has passed. I have stood for the flag in 120 degrees, -10 degrees, in rain, snow, sand and everything in between.  Do you think I wanted to stand every time? No, but it certainly didn’t kill me. It was only 2 minutes after all.  

Now, since you are so eager to throw insults and personal attacks at a random stranger because you are NOT pissed off about a piece of cloth and a song; I’ll just ask a question. What were you saying about ignorance and lack of critical thinking skills?"
