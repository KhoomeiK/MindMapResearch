policeuk,ffnwnmi,t1_ffme13g,1580071711.0,Unless he was known for faking his identity/making forgeries of documents this does seem weird to me. But as always you really have to be there to know what went on. A million and one factors could have contributed yontheir doubt...or they could just be shit.
Terminator,ffiwclc,t3_etubec,1579984295.0,Not really complete if it's to 2009...
AskUK,ffivutu,t3_etp835,1579983940.0,"For me more than 45 minutes would be too long. But I've only ever had twenty minute to half hour commutes on average. A working day is usually around 8 hours, I don't see why I should spend an additional 90 or more minutes a day travelling. That's over ten percent of your working day."
policeuk,ffbxggw,t3_essmvv,1579785910.0,"Buy a bike. You can exercise and go places at the same time. Easy to gauge your improvements (distance and time being the only variables) and some forces do a bike to work scheme so a grand bike costs you 8 quid a month before tax (so 6 quid a month). I also find it a lot easier on the joints than running but that's my opinion, dunno how true it is."

NewcastleUponTyne,fey9c21,t3_eqtkku,1579442443.0,"One of these fucks was contacting parents of children who died of cancer offering his condolences and telling them that lampposts killed their kid... Should be locked up.

He also uploaded a video of a dying tree next to a lamppost and said because the leaves were o KY dead on one side (the side nearest the lamppost) it was obvious the lamppost killed the tree. Even though the grass and hedges around the lamppost (and other trees I'm the street next to lampposts) we're competely fine."
todayilearned,fenaxzy,t1_fel39bq,1579280788.0,Why don't they just ask you every time you're at the doctors. In the UK I had to go out of my way to register.
policeuk,fejbxbs,t1_fehq9gt,1579166282.0,I'm sure in training we were told of a few incidents where what you said was the case. There's certainly a large element of regular criminality there too.

They're there to fight a war not take trophies, additionally he executed a prisoner with a knife, allegedly shot unarmed civilians and took great pleasure I'm both. If the rest of your platoon of special forces members think you're a whacko, you probably are."
worldnews,fdr83hk,t1_fdq6vz6,1578680748.0,"Once had a job where we had to log everything we did that day, you'd finish a 5 minute phonecall and have to log who it was with and why. I used to guess every time I put it then add 30 seconds for 'updating this log' after every task which really pissed my manager off. At the end of every day I'd add up all my tasks and make sure they amounted to 8 hours, if it didn't I'd add an additional task for the exact difference. The last task of every day always some random time like 12 and a half minutes whilst every other job was 5 10 20 minutes etc.

It turned out (unsurprisingly) that the time spent updating the log and then for management to check EVERY employees log way surpassed any time lost by inefficient or lazy employees. It also didn't catch any of the lazy employees because they just lied on their logs."

policeuk,fdavf6u,t1_fda7y4u,1578250718.0,No idea. I've never had a job that does this before the police. I used to get paid on the 5th for the previous months pay in my old job before joining the police.
policeuk,fda2i3v,t1_fd9qzc1,1578240930.0,If you're getting paid on the 20th you'll get the whole month paid. Therefore you would or at least most do. May be different with each force.
AskUK,fd8u43s,t1_fd8qd46,1578223362.0,"I once asked for a spray of something and the guy said it was a fiver for the spray after I sprayed it. I put 50p on the plate, laughed and walked out.

Never used them since. Although I don't go clubbing anymore anyway."

As for running I'd really recommend parkrun. 5k every Saturday will do a world of good. There's a few people at ours who do it in like 55 minutes (they walk the entire thing) and they're cheered on as they cross the finish line by people who do it in  like 16 minutes (essentially they sprint the entire thing). That's the kind if community you get at parkrun. Plus it's free!"
todayilearned,fd7owpc,t1_fd5ewhl,1578207810.0,So it's only altruistic if they hate doing it? If someone enjoys doing the right thing are you saying they're not a good person because they're only doing the right thing because they feel good about it?
todayilearned,fd5jm2h,t1_fd5ajwe,1578178314.0,I worked for a company that had 120% turnover and it was a fucking nightmare so I hate to think what this was like. A lot of our staff were unskilled or generic admin workers too. It would be much worse if they were skilled factory workers.
policeuk,fd4pkxm,t1_fd3jmn3,1578169807.0,We were trained that earpieces are essential for your reason and also for generally confidentiality/professionalism. Don't want to be at the family of a misper for them to hear on the radio their loved one has been found in a ditch or something.
policeuk,fcyksz7,t1_fcwze8f,1578081821.0,I think your last paragraph overlooks the fact a lot of nasty criminals use the drugs trade to fund their other activities. Police don't necessarily want to go after Dave down the street for having a line of coke every now and then but they definitely want to get a hols of the guy bringing a few kilos into the country as chances are his criminality doesn't end there.
policeuk,fcykbtc,t1_fcxdzx7,1578081564.0,Their point is you're not going to get a script to get off your tits and your post mentions altering your state of mind which medicinal use wouldn't do.

I can totally understand why cops do it but for me I couldn't imagine anything worse than working with someone I live with/sleep with or whatever. Especially as cops because there's a pretty high chance they're going to cheat on you with another cop before long."

I'm just out of training school though so may be misremembering."
askscience,fcnuq0e,t1_fcniyne,1577818800.0,Olympic level archers with modern equipment would probably struggle to hit an armpit of a man at full sprint. I doubt a peasant with a primitive bow would be aiming for weakspots. Considering aiming straight ahead reduces your range and rate of fire its more than likely they'd get as many bows as possible and fire volley after volley at them and hope for a hit.
