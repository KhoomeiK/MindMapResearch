worldnews,ffyt6kp,t1_ffybd03,1580354519.0,I've read that Scotland is very much dependent on London for money because of how old their population is.  I have my doubts that Brussels would want an old folks home (they already have several).
unRAID,ffxo7fc,t1_ffxgbev,1580329128.0,"Hmm.  I don't have to do that.  If I remember correctly, I had some initial issues getting it to accept the password, but now it just works."

When asked about that, I was insulted, so I'm not sure this guy is worth the effort to assist."

That's what you said.  You said every few weeks Plex would consume your RAM, not every few days.  Now you're changing your symptoms, which you shouldn't do if you want help on this subreddit.

So again, my solution would resolve the issue if you stood by your original description of the problem."
unRAID,ffwry2p,t1_ffw7c02,1580309569.0,"All my dockers restart every week because I use CA Backup.  So this would never be a problem for me, and it might be a good idea for you to use it too if your system/apps are on a cache."
Amd,ffvnrs1,t1_ffv14sx,1580268487.0,A better question is this; how much is your time that you spend troubleshooting worth?
Amd,ffvno6g,t1_ffusz17,1580268419.0,All I've seen on this subreddit since this generation of cards launched is complaints.  I'm not touching these cards with a 10 foot pole (even though I'd love one for a macOS VM) and I think that applies to a lot of people.
unRAID,ffrya57,t3_euwclp,1580168654.0,"I'd use it as an Unassigned Device if you don't want the data on your array.

Otherwise, if you want it backed up to the array, the only limitation is that your Parity disks need to be equal to or larger in size to the 3TB Barracuda you're adding.

You might also want to have your shares exclude this disk if you want is as part of the array."
unRAID,ffrs5o0,t1_ffpoazt,1580164619.0,"I feel this was a bit poorly worded, and I want to make sure people understand what you mean so they don't have to update their server twice; if you want the Nvidia drivers, don't update using the official Limetech update (ie Tools > Update).  Use the Nvidia Unraid plugin to update."
RedLetterMedia,ffr6glf,t1_ffr0euv,1580151485.0,Watch the video.  There's a section that shows a TOS scene that deals with what Trek is about while attacking a modern problem (racism).  Picard isn't dealing with it tastefully.
PrequelMemes,ffqvzzl,t1_ffqvts9,1580144903.0,"According to what I've read, Spielberg did IJ4 as a favor to Lucas and didn't exercise much creative control over the story as most directors can."
RedLetterMedia,ffqrdlk,t1_ffqovuq,1580141879.0,I think these new shows are too obvious about it.  Previous Star Trek series handled similar issues with taste without attacking the audience.  The writers now can't seem to do that.
PrequelMemes,ffqn0d9,t3_euo7qh,1580138892.0,"As long as he's just the idea man, I'm okay with this.  Get some better directors and his stories will shine."
RedLetterMedia,ffqja86,t1_ffpnbm9,1580136146.0,"That's assuming that you agree with the writers that the government's immigration policy is regressive.  By being on so on the nose, you turn off half the country that doesn't share those views."

worldnews,ffgnxm3,t1_ffgn5bg,1579910664.0,Their reach is more limited than you're implying because everyone wants access to the US market.  No other market can you say that about.
unRAID,ffgmu6n,t1_ffgerko,1579909904.0,"I can't find any reasonably priced LGA 2011-3 dual CPU motherboards on Ebay.  Best I found is $450 and the 2011 one I've found is $150.  The CPUs are also a lot more expensive.

I think this is because 2011-3... the last released CPUs were in 2017, so a lot of these units are still being used in production."

worldnews,ffebf28,t1_ffe5n3n,1579842087.0,"China can't bully as much as you think it can.  Yeah, it's moving around in the South China Sea and buying infrastructure in Africa.  But it has no force projection.

If there ever were a serious problem with their neighbors, all it would take is a few subs to blockade their oil supplies."
worldnews,ffdvwrb,t1_ffduwee,1579830243.0,"Countries don't react that way when they are internally fragile.  It's only when dictatorships are strong that they look outward.  If something goes wrong internally, whether financially, economically, etc, they will turn inward.

This is already happening.  Xi made himself dictator for life, and they are moving to crack down internally with the social credit system, the Chinese internet, etc."
worldnews,ffde6sq,t1_ffd5n8d,1579819000.0,"China isn't an economic equal... they have no uniting waterway like the US does (Mississippi river system).  This means their production sites have to be centrally located and it is expensive to transport goods.

They have a crashing demographic because of the one-child policy (half as many millennials as they would have otherwise) which means it now costs more to hire a Chinese worker than a Mexican worker.

They have more interest free credit sloshing around their system than the entire Western world during the 2008 crisis (1000% more in fact).  When that bill comes due the country may not even survive.

They have no oil reserves and can't even feed their population without imports.  The US is a fossil fuel exporter and if push came to shove has enough oil domestically that we could shut off the exports and use it internally.

The Chinese economy is entirely dependent on the United States, while only 4% of US GDP is tied to exports outside of Mexico and Canada.

China has made more concessions in the last 6 months than it has made in the last 20 years because they know they are vulnerable."

UpliftingNews,ffch23z,t1_ffcdn23,1579799301.0,"Because you can observe someone's handwriting to see which hand is better at it.  You could do a reflex test by throwing a ball at them, or have them throw a ball with both hands to measure accuracy.

There are other reasons besides that, but that should be enough."
UpliftingNews,ffc3oca,t1_ffbzryp,1579790753.0,"The issue is that something like that is subjective by its very nature.  Your beliefs about yourself are entirely your own, and cannot be objective because those things can change even the next day.

The earlier examples of being a brunette and right handed are terrible, as both of those things are objective, ie, everyone can agree on those things."
UpliftingNews,ffc3cpn,t1_ffb9yy8,1579790523.0,It's because Bloomberg (who is big time anti-gun) bought the election.  I dunno why people aren't more upset over that.
UpliftingNews,ffc39nv,t1_ffazf0f,1579790462.0,"I don't think you understand how these bills fundamentally upset the conservatives in my State.  I fully expect 2021 to be a blowout with the GOP seizing a majority of seats because of how angry it has made them.

Gun control isn't popular with many of the Democrats in this State either, and that's not even mentioning how upset conservatives get about transgender issues."

Multi-generational households were a thing for most of humanity's history.

In the 20th century that began to change as we had a population explosion post WW2.

Then you call me a monster for shining a light on the truth.  You're so pathetic.

None of you people have explained how $800 billion is going to feed everyone.  That's because it WON'T.

Warren's plan is the only one that's been honest about how she's going to try to pay for it, and she's getting slaughtered in the primary because she was honest.  So Democrats like these ideas only in theory.

Even her plan doesn't zero out defense spending, and neither does Bernie's.

Yet you say we can pay for these things just by gutting the defense budget.  You're so dishonest it's even more pathetic."
SelfAwarewolves,ff25l9l,t1_ff22f1p,1579494442.0,Federal spending is Federal spending.  You don't get to redefine words to fit your agenda.  1984 wasn't supposed to be a manual.
