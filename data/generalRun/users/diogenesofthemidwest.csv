I'm usually against working out mid-season at home, barring special circumstances. 4 days a week of practice and two day weekend tournaments are usually what your body wants to handle. Your coaches try to calibrate the amount of work you do so you don't overexert yourself. If your not feeling like that is enough, you're probably not working hard enough during practice.

Special circumstances include: 

You aren't given weight room access. Get an outside gym membership. Watch yourself in there. Skip a day between the same muscle group. Never the day before a match.

You need to cut. The goal is to lose the water weight with as little physical exertion, especially anaerobic, as necessary. Layers, as many as possible. Olypticals and recumbants are good. Treadmills are OK, but it's more knee strain."

Hydrogen and oxygen combining is a highly exothermic reaction that happens very readily if the components are present. It's literally rocket fuel.

After that it took population 3 stars forming and exploding to fuse together the necessary oxygen. Whenever that exploded out oxygen and other gasses floating in space clumped together to make our sun the violence of its creation meant that they were separated (hard to form bonds as a plasma). Then as the dust settled in the stellar cloud hydrogen and oxygen could finally come together making the water we have today.
