todayilearned,fel26ad,t1_fel0ijp,1579212439.0,"Germany was working on a timeline, their armies were supplied through massive but still finite reserves, they did not have the ability to sustain that level of a fighting force indefinitely. All Russia had to do was not lose for long enough, and Russia is a big ass country."
todayilearned,fekr947,t1_fekq8be,1579205954.0,"I would argue the fact they had twice as many casualties despite having double the number of men deployed as their foe demonstrates objectively they were under-equipped in some form or another.

The ""one gun for every ten men"" thing may be false but there are many shades between that and ""fully equipped prime fighting force"""
todayilearned,fekpa6j,t1_feko9jz,1579204784.0,"Russia would have and still basically did beat Germany by crushing them with raw numbers. Again, allied intervention brought the inevitable result sooner, possibly years sooner, than it would have otherwise but Russia was basically certain to win.

Despite allied help the Russian army was critically under-equipped for pretty much the whole war. They lost multiple men for every German soldier killed, but in the end they had ten more men for every one lost and Germany didn't"

Full persistence is years off, any ship you buy now I'd consider you lucky to hold for more than a quarter.

The game needs to be 99% balanced and complete before full persistence can be implemented, we don't even have the full feature set in, and once we do it'll take a while to balance everything properly."
