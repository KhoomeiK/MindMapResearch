Imagine you live in a suburb with ten people. But one person, has been living there for years, and is technically zoned on mixed industrial. Well, the rest of the 9 people want the one person to stop hitting meta together day in and night out, so request to change his zoning privileges. Because of a majority, the districting changes his. Now the dude has two choices: decide to buy a piece of property somewhere else to continue his work (perhaps needing to sell his home), or build a massive tank and run everyone over.

People are naturally pursuing profit. So once the market balances itself out, people won’t want to undercut if they know they can just make a certain amount of money. 

I mean, look at throngs like eBay and all that. They give you a suggested price, simply because “that’s the price people have sold it at”. If you’re selling your guitar there and it says “people have sold it for $100” you’re not going to say “well I’m going to sell it for $25 to compete against the competition”.

You rent those nice homes to a bunch of families. 

One day, the mother complains that there’s a leak. Instead of fixing the leak, you blame the leak on your tenant. You tell them to cough up $2000 or to be evicted. You know they can’t fight back, because they need the place. It’s more costly to get a lawyer involved in their end to counter your decision that the leak was actually because you hadn’t updated your pipes in 25 years. 

They sell some stuff, the oldest kid gets a job to help get that $2000, and ultimately pay it. You then get your brother-in-law, a plumber, to go fix the leak for $235. 

See how easy it was for you? How easy it was to abuse the power you had over your tenants?
