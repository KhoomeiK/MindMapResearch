therewasanattempt,fegllih,t1_feglkvn,1579096536.0,Yes.
therewasanattempt,fegljo9,t1_feglitz,1579096495.0,Better lol.

Instagramreality,fedp4ov,t3_eolkvx,1579016841.0,That’s the influence of the Kardashian/Jenner clan.
awfuleverything,fe423ib,t1_fe3lcbp,1578855022.0,That’s what I thought as well.
creepyPMs,fe2lah8,t1_fe2kwsj,1578839852.0,"Yeah, but he could just be you know, normal about it."
WTF,fe2gsya,t1_fe15kgb,1578838190.0,"It wasn’t the whole train, just the side you see on the photo."
AmItheAsshole,fdvm4t5,t1_fdsow6r,1578748897.0,"I also don’t think that the sister is working out either. Losing weight is mostly diet, but also moving around. Doesn’t have to be gym, just walking for a bit is fine too."
aww,fdqkfds,t1_fdqjnpt,1578668815.0,"Okay, but just imagine this. Just because your cat is healthy, doesn’t mean the other ones are. Maybe yours did get the natural mutation, that’s possible. 

But munchkins nowadays *are* being bred to be like that, and those are the ones who have health problems. It’s not misinformation, it’s just the truth. They can develop spinal problems, which will interfere with the growth of their organs and can be fatal. 
While the munchkin breed is still ‘young’ and doesn’t have too many problems *yet*, I’m afraid they will have more problems in the future. People want them, they’re adorable. But that’s also the point where bad breeders come in and breed them to hell with lots of health issues.  Just look at pugs. 

I never said anything about you taking care of your pets. I bet you’re a wonderful cat parent :)"
aww,fdqiqwx,t1_fdqi8jm,1578667673.0,"How do you know she’s not in pain though? Cats are really good at hiding it well. 

I just think it’s wrong to knowingly get a breed (whether it be dogs or cats) that are known to have problems, due to their breeding."
aww,fdpqk35,t1_fdpqe5r,1578636734.0,"Their ears. It’s literally a deformity and can cause diseases.

aww,fdplslw,t1_fdpefxh,1578632217.0,Have you ever looked up what a pug originally looked like? They were so cute! Aaaaand then humanity decided to breed them with flat noses and bulging eyes. UGH.
aww,fdpllwv,t1_fdphr3h,1578632058.0,"I mean, I think they’re but I know these kitties must always be in pain. Just like Scottish folds. 

So while I find them cute, I will *never* get one of these kind of cats. I want my babies to be healthy and safe."
Instagramreality,fdomqki,t1_fdkte4l,1578608303.0,"These were really popular on tumblr when I was a teen. I hated myself because of it. Jealous I could never look like that. 

I still hate myself, but at least now I know these photos are fake as fuck lol."
Instagramreality,fdolsy4,t1_fdoch2v,1578607746.0,"It’s still edited. Look at the wall behind his right arm (our left). It’s warped.
Actually, the other side is too."
Instagramreality,fdolb34,t3_emgp1a,1578607451.0,The photo on the bottom seems extra edited though. It does NOT correspond with the top photo.

And where did he mention she wasn’t attractive? He just said he wouldn’t date her either. No mention of attractiveness."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fdd347s,t3_ekjoag,1578292833.0,I would have fucking smacked that foot so hard. Fuck off with your nasty shit.

Also, her music sucks."

insaneparents,fceq1kz,t1_fcemydc,1577622767.0,"Kid had leukaemia and was undergoing treatment. Was sent home after said treatment, but came back a few days later with a fever, diarrhoea and extreme vomiting. They ran some blood work and found organisms normally only found in feces, and it caused a bacterial infection and sepsis. They ran a check but couldn’t find a cause for the organisms. 

Then they looked at the cameras which are present in the room he stayed in. They found out that his mom was injecting fluids into his IV. Mom claimed it was “just water” but later admitted she was injecting the boy’s own feces into his IV."
