Extreme example but I’m sure at some point promoting LGBT rights would have been considered extreme speech, should that have been banned? Should anti illegal immigration speech be banned because it could incite hate against legal groups? If I say trans people should see a therapist before and after surgery is that hate speech? 

Actions are binary, they either happen or they don’t, and should be punished. Hate speech is interpretation. 

Personally if it’s the free market with other choices and it’s not a vital service. IE Gay wedding cake. I don’t think they should be forced to make a gay couples a cake. The gay couple has a choice of bakeries. But now the government is breaking someone else’s rights and demanding they do a service although it violates their relegion.

How you act plays a big part of it too though. I know for me I hate when a gay guy is super obnoxious and flamboyant. I prefer subtle probably because that’s how I am.

A lot of heavy machinery is like a car that if you are inside it and harnessed you’ll be ok. At least with a harness taking the blow you only need to worry about internal bleeding, which normally is a little less life threatening than bleeding out 

I remember a story of a guy who had improper training on a forklift, it started to roll down a hill and instead of staying inside and harnessed, he tried to jump out and got his leg caught on the harness. The forklift went down the hill and he was dragged along with. He ended up losing both legs, his pelvis, entire arm and other forearm.  I’ll see if I can link to it.
