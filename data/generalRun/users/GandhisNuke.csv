ApexOutlands,ffepun6,t1_ffepmdw,1579859472.0,"4 legends a year sorry I'm an idiot. Anyway my point was those take some time to develop so I highly doubt they're gonna drop 2 so close to each other. Ofc it's possible bc 1y anniversary and I'd love it, I just don't think so"
ApexOutlands,ffepkf5,t1_ffe9qgo,1579859043.0,Very unlikely tho. From now on it's gonna be just 3 month seasons. That'd be 4 legends a year. Which is basically the release schedule for all the other character based shooters too
ApexOutlands,ffepe0h,t1_ffe0hbj,1579858772.0,I still don't wanna give up on the idea that maybe we'll get a 2 legend season but I doubt it. Maybe we'll at least get another weapon because honestly who asked for another sniper
farcry,ffcy8nx,t1_ffckn30,1579809740.0,You haven't blown it up?
apexlegends,ff9mw2l,t1_ff94r14,1579716332.0,"I can hardly imagine he won't but more importantly, could he maybe (in like 5 years if it keeps going at this pace) have a scythe heirloom?"
RoastMe,ff7pmmv,t1_ff73adu,1579655281.0,You 2 are a dream team
apexuniversity,ff4fvi5,t1_ff4aqa0,1579562622.0,"To add to that, I read somewhere that that's what actual rolling (/creeping) barrages were actually used for in military history, right before the infantry pushes forward"
dankmemes,ff11enn,t1_ff0ayhw,1579474303.0,The guy was immunocompromised. Apparently there's bacteria in a dog's mouth that are lethal to humans if they get in your system except your immune system can fight them off easily. Not if you're immunocompromised tho. This is an insanely rare occurrence tho which is why no one's ever heard about it. Watched it a couple days ago I hope I got everything right

dankmemes,ff109me,t1_fezsart,1579474005.0,"I love how he can explain medicine so it makes sense to absolute dimwits like me but it makes me so paranoid like I get a slight headache and go to bed suddenly I hear his voice in my head ""He thought it was just a mild headache so he went to bed..."""
Warframe,fey1jbr,t1_fex817g,1579439587.0,"Not just is the name related, he also deals 30% more damage with sword type weapons so you've definitely got the right idea so far"
apexlegends,fexf0s4,t3_eqr8ve,1579429923.0,I never understood why the seasonal badges never came back after season 1. Cool animated badges to work for every season gives you (or gave me at least) a reason to keep at it even after I was done with the BP and it was soo satisfying to finally get it
apexlegends,fev4od7,t1_fetj759,1579393032.0,What absolutely shreds is the threat sights because those would obv be useless with 3rd person so you get 1st person when ADSing with those
apexlegends,feuyidw,t1_fetwz98,1579391194.0,Right my bad
Warframe,fesk99z,t1_fesjpuf,1579366107.0,I get that but isn't that just yet another way of artificial Oro?
Cringetopia,fesepvj,t1_fertzie,1579364433.0,This is legit fucking scum. He posted this on an app primarily used by children and young teenagers and he damn well knows it

apexlegends,fes82e0,t1_ferkkh4,1579362368.0,Or can he maybe **GET A SMALLER HEAD** honestly his huge noggin is just begging for headshots
apexlegends,fes656w,t1_ferh7a5,1579361855.0,"Like there's barely any situations where it's not good enough + it's perfect for the double tap, trying that with the threat sights would be such a pain"
apexlegends,fes1634,t1_fero6bm,1579360366.0,Armed and dangerous is gonna be dope too
Warframe,feqsyjg,t1_feowsug,1579345629.0,What makes you think so?
apexlegends,fep5428,t1_fenyozn,1579312332.0,First time I saw Richter I legit thought it was gibby
apexlegends,fenvkph,t1_feg21tk,1579291575.0,"Some interview very early on when the game was just blowing up I think, maybe it was also a Twitter q&a not sure"
Warframe,fenvb8l,t1_felydn4,1579291426.0,"Ok tbf I haven't looked into the lore in game itself a lot but I've watched a bunch of the YouTube videos and the ppl there seem to agree that Oro is some kind of ""soul"" that allows us to permanently kill those that would otherwise be immortal by absorbing theirs (like the orokin who were clearly immortal as the ordan karris story shows) so I'm gonna go with that until proven otherwise"
Warframe,fejl6aj,t1_fejk1qr,1579178617.0,"The way I understood it, the only reason we're limited in our revives is because channeling those amounts of void energy through the warframe repeatedly and without repairs may permanently break it. Also I'm pretty sure we're still immortal. If I've got this whole thing right, we've got an Oro and therefore can only be permanently killed by other enemies who also have an Oro in some way (such as the arcane Oro that strong sentients possess aka how og mirage died)"
apexlegends,fefcaif,t1_feefsqg,1579053197.0,Shit that caught me off guard nice one
apexlegends,feef8r7,t1_feeef5x,1579032540.0,"And bloodhound is non-binary. Oh, and pathfinder has sex. That would be all"
apexlegends,feeexb6,t1_feecbw1,1579032350.0,Would be awesome if he prepared to punch you and then like reconsidered and picked you up instead
apexlegends,feedikn,t1_fedx653,1579031519.0,I was not ready. Bless you
apexlegends,fee8cp9,t1_fee8268,1579028492.0,"Absolutely, the only reason it's not implemented yet is because they're still working on the animation for Gibby chewing on the bullets"
apexlegends,fedxf4a,t1_fedkj6n,1579021924.0,I guess I mean he did it for the inventory but it's frustrating to watch him try and fail so much with the shield

apexlegends,fe1asbf,t3_enlvom,1578824428.0,What I'm afraid of is how far they'll go. Cuz the game tends to freeze for me every now and then and whenever it does I obviously alt+f4 to get out. I'm just hoping they can tell the difference when they're swinging their banhammer
apexlegends,fdz1i2b,t1_fdqltq9,1578785754.0,I love bloodhound and I would 100% pay for that skin

Warframe,fdpzuoz,t1_fdorvpf,1578647878.0,Really? To me it's the one game where I've barely had any toxic encounters

Minecraft,fdlngfo,t3_eluhwl,1578528008.0,FR tho where do you find those? I don't play a whole lot but I've got one world with a decent amount of hours and I've done tons of ocean exploring there. Never once seen one
pathfindermains,fdl47rm,t1_fdk0ppf,1578516767.0,That does sound a lot more reasonable
Warframe,fd5w298,t1_fd5b6qu,1578182220.0,Like I get that there's different playstyles and all but it's still weird to me to see people with half my time spent and twice as much (or more) accomplished
Warframe,fd5vw9c,t1_fd5ra52,1578182154.0,I was about to say this. Aklex Prime is barely an upgrade and doesn't feel nearly as good to use as Lex Prime
