There's a Chinese manhua called Tang Yin in another realm. It's not that similar to Solo leveling but it has an op Mc who keep getting stronger. What I like about the Mc is that he knows what he's doing very well. For example, if an enemy is stronger than him he'll avoid him and come back later after getting stronger. The art is a bit weird tho. There are no rpg elements or ""leveling up"" at all.. So, that could be a turn off for some."
