videos,fgs3929,t3_f051sk,1581069303.0,Unknown reasons? It's called quarantine... the destination may be unknown but the reason certainly isn't.
shanghai,fgi6s1x,t1_fghxz1l,1580808503.0,A) we don't teach kids which that rule seems mostly related to. B) I simply hadn't heard about it yet as I'm out of the country atm and haven't kept up with current industry news C) it's not time to open for us yet so not really relevant D) all of our teachers and students don't want to come back to work / class yet which is much more important to us than some regulatory decision. .... etc
languagelearning,fghaz22,t1_fgfdnp2,1580780779.0,Agreed and thanks
shanghai,fghatza,t1_fgfbtdp,1580780685.0,I’m the owner and we haven’t heard anything about that rule. So I’ll change my answer to we’ll see!

todayilearned,fgewba1,t3_exy258,1580712509.0,Someone told me once the wine industry is so fucked that even white wine and red wine basically taste the same that in blind taste tests experts couldn’t tell the difference between red and white wine.
languagelearning,fgem49v,t3_exs2xv,1580702961.0,"I’m half way through the video and I’m struggling to see why you want to teach your kid Polish when clearly English is the core language for your life, your immediate and extended family’s life, and really, Polish just is never going to be a convenient, natural, or intuitive language for your kids to use, be immersed in or get much out of other than perhaps your pride and contentment that they have learned a language to a native level that you never managed yourself."
languagelearning,fgelrlt,t1_fge6qfw,1580702688.0,Lol you spent more time dissing this person than you did offering anything meaningful either. Dickhead.

smallbusiness,fg5w7qv,t3_ewv4x0,1580541479.0,I had this exact idea after starting a company and buying plants for our office only to have them die constantly and wishing i could ask someone who knew what they were doing.

Dreadlocks,fg2stby,t3_ewgxvh,1580454422.0,Wow stunning. I just saw your first post and the comments on the site... sorry you have to endure wankers like that. Grats on the persistence. Is this neglect btw?

Dreadlocks,ffsgva9,t3_eut3dq,1580181393.0,I had the same thought and stopped and super don’t regret it. I never liked the unnatural feeling crochet gave me and now my dreads (after 18 months of no crochet) have much more of an interesting feeling to them and each one is different now rather than all being uniform

worldnews,ffkh1pr,t3_etwz13,1580022634.0,Not surprised. Doctors in China work for the government generally so it’s all controlled

gadgets,ffesw40,t3_esya6k,1579863959.0,Lol we can’t even transfer files from iphone to pc via usb consistently. How the fudge are we gona have the tech to make this work? Smells like bs
Entrepreneur,ffbzsg0,t3_eslzm7,1579787832.0,being older is an advantage to almost everything in life except living itself

worldnews,ff8jugu,t1_ff7yvv8,1579681877.0,I agree. Every time someone tells me they work in advertising i think “great your job is convincing people to buy what they don’t need” - exactly what caused this fkn problem in the first place
pics,ff2de3m,t1_ff1opxs,1579501612.0,I watched it on a plane and the constant roar of the engines and the whole atmosphere made me feel I was right there with them. It ruled.
smallbusiness,fer98om,t3_eqaq1m,1579351364.0,"It took my business (English training company) about 3 years to generate any meaningful profit, now after 6 years we're doing well. The last 3 years we have increased profits around 50% each year."
funny,fejseyy,t3_epi5wq,1579184703.0,"Kinda weird though starting sentences with ""and"" and ""but"" and not using conjunctions for that final ""amazing"" sentence. It wasn't really that great of a sentence - it was more like a list of short sentences."
todayilearned,fejcw5l,t3_epdbvn,1579167752.0,"When I was young my dad and I were at the beach and he was telling me about blue ringed ocopuses and how deadly they are. We noticed a little girl and her mum leaning over a little rock pool playing with something on a stick, we wandered closer to check it out and sure enough it was a little blue ringed ocopus. My dad almost had a heart attack, but quietly and calmly told the mother that it was not safe at all and to step away. Crisis averted, and a family yearly told story was born."
videos,feisate,t1_fehhtg8,1579145930.0,Chinese family?
politics,fe6ojwu,t1_fe6cedw,1578898258.0,Yeah well biggest issue is his base doesn’t give a rats so we’re all screwed. Even if he loses this huge group of imbeciles isn’t going anywhere. I’m sure the next republican in line will be even more of a douche if that’s possible
politics,fe69lmb,t1_fe3jfl6,1578884837.0,Isn’t that just the way the weirdo breathes? It probably takes so much of his focus to read that he can’t breathe at the same time
politics,fe0dz4m,t1_fdwx1bp,1578811370.0,I’m confused. Just watched that vid of him giving the iran speech and didn’t notice a single sniff or snort despite the headline. He does seem out of it but nothing more than his usual disgusting self.
