Tekken,ffumw3z,t3_ev8gjy,1580245321.0,"Completely disagree. This is such a bad mentality to have as far as trying to sustain and grow the competitive scene as both an enjoyable game and spectator sport. Sad that a top player is saying something like this. 

As a competitor you should be pretty pissed that your hard work on any given character (who in the relatively balanced game you ***had been*** playing, could allow you to do very well in tournaments) gets completely trumped by someone playing this new busted character they just added.

Not only that, it doesn't follow the spirit of competition at all, which is outplaying your opponent.

Abusing a broken character who even the devs have said will be further nerfed is not trying to be competitive at all, it's abusing an error to temporarily boost yourself above where you would normally be capable of getting. 

In games like Lol they have had many small errors like this over the years. They try to hotfix when they can, but sometimes it takes a bit. Specific players will take advantage of those errors to boost their rank. But because it wasn't their skill, it was just the broken character, so they fall right back down to where they belong once the character gets nerfed to a more reasonable spot. 

Are the fanbase and sponsors, the two groups who fund the competitive scene, going to be happy seeing some players punching well above their level temporarily and then fall like a rock when nerfs come through because they weren't actually more skilled then their opponents?

I don't think so. It takes away from the competition when that happens. 

It's the duty of the community and top players who have the most influence to let the devs know that this is a problem and get them to change it in order to make the best competitive experience possible. 

I'm not talking about crying about everything or catering to scrubs. I'm talking about game breaking nonsense at top level like Leroy, who ruins the experience for everyone, players, spectators, and top level competitors.

Don't just put your head down and go with it, expecting that daddy bamco knows best and they will do what you want. Tell them what you want. This goes exponentially for the players with the most influence like top players who can best convey that message to the people in charge of the game."
Tekken,ffugj2y,t1_ffu1gs3,1580241479.0,"Exactly. Give me a basic ass shoto and teach me the couple jank things the new characters have and it's the same game as always, grabs are just way better than any game except 2, and parrys are only on certain characters and they aren't as good as 3. 

All you really have to update is a few new moves and new v-triggers. But once you see it once or twice you'll know what it is and won't get janked again.

The only thing that really hurts getting better in SF is the mediocre netcode. If that was KI and MK levels of good, offline and online would basically be the same because you could hit all of your punishes properly. 

In Tekken you can see the same string 15 times and if it goes into a stance you still haven't even seen all the options they have from it, so you can't react properly and get cheesed by shit that you wouldn't if you knew the matchup and stance. That's not counting the also mediocre netcode which makes certain things was more obnoxious than they should be."

Yeah but that's why she is a fair bit stronger than the others you mentioned. 

>So I'd say that it's worth mentioning right now, because non-damaging but unreactable to defend against neutral mixups that lead to strong chain pressure ARE proven to be a viable approach to offensive pressure.

I do agree it should be added, it should just be noted that it is both more niche, and less effective than just having unreactable openers. 

>It should be expanded upon. For example, make Zhanhu's forward dodge light enhanced, then make his light finishers 533ms. Unlikely to damage, but easily leads into viable offense.

That's one way to do it. I would also like if more characters just had unreactable openers as well. Pressing a button shouldn't put you in the disadvantage as often as it does. Assassins especially need a lot more of those for them to work."
SmashRage,fft3lc2,t1_fft296a,1580205259.0,"Locals are not nearly enough on their own. Not in today's age. 

Especially when you either can't attend all of them, the player skill level is relatively low, or the player diversity is incredibly limited. 

In a game with 80 characters, you need to fight a ton of players, and you need to do it a lot. You also need to be able to play against players better than yourself to get better. 

That's why tight knit groups like Florida, Japan, Korea, and very large groups like California and New York, all have the best scenes for most fighting games, but *especially for smash* (except Korea). 

Someone going to some random local can't compete against that. So they end up having to travel a ton just to level up, which is way too expensive for most people. 

But online in many games has allowed many people access to those top level players and character practice when they never would have had that before geographically. 

Smash, and all the Asian made fighters really, have not caught up to that and still have garbage netcode compared to the amazing online they could have.

That's not even getting into that Smash doesn't even have a proper ranked mode or ranking system at all, which is so far behind any modern fighter that it would be laughable if it weren't so sad."

He is pretty good..... but Amy exists. 

So I have Siegfried, who is very close to my SC2 Nightmare

Amy, who in her SC6 version is honestly a contender with SC2 Nightmare for my favorite SC character of all time in fun. Even more than her Sc4 version. She's just way more fun than Raph and she single handedly got me more into Sc6 after not playing it because I was flooded out. 

>SC2 Raph wasn't weak in SC2 iirc. Not a top tier, but he wasn't nearly as underwhelming as he was in SC3, SC4, and SC5.

Pretty sure he was considered low tier to low mid tier at it's heyday. Even post SC2HD online I'm pretty sure he's still considered low or low mid tier.

It wasn't as bad as later games, but there is a reason he's always been in the ""for fun"" slot, where as Amy as taken a positon as my secondary in Sc4 and now my full main in Sc6. 

She's stronger and more fun. Win win."
Fighters,ffsqti0,t1_ffsnw66,1580189223.0,"Lol that's amazing. 

Walk in thinking you're playing against some hardcore competitors, then they jank you with low tiers for 2 hours. 

You must have pissed a lot of people off. Probably helped them learn the matchup so they wouldn't get janked later though, which us kind of a service tbh."
Fighters,ffsmnq6,t3_euxpkd,1580185592.0,"Played for fun or actually mained/secondaried? 

Because I usually have a weaker character or two in every game I play a ton that I just enjoy for the aesthetic or because I like their playstyle even though they are bad. 

But I would never main a low tier. The top tiers almost always ""feel"" better to play in most games because they have better/stronger/more, tools at their disposal.

For Fun: 

Bowser in multiple smash games. Worst in Melee, worst in Brawl, worst in PM 3.5 and earlier, mid tier in 4, he is actually decent in Ult though as a real secondary. I played him for fun in all except Melee much because he's too bad to even be fun in Melee. Hilariously enough I use him as an actual try-hard secondary in ult now.

Raphael in SC: He's basically always been bad as well. Amy is better and more fun though so I don't play him anymore. But in SC2 and SC5 I played him as my for fun character.


Mained: 

- The Apprentice in Sc4. The most defensive I think I ever played. To be good with him you had to turtle a bit, as suprising as that would sound to anyone who played The Force Unleashed and would expect him to just be going ham. 

Hilde ruined the game so much that I didn't care that much about being great as I did in later games I played competitively. If I had cared more I probably would have mained Amy and played him as a for fun/secondary instead of the other way around. 

- Zangief in SF 2 all versions. God I don't know why I played that garbage character. There is something I really like about him aesthetically, and when I was a kid I was better than most people I knew so I didn't need to good character to win. I don't actually like how he plays as much anymore, but young me loved Zangief and Chun for some reason. Young me was kind of a degenerate in playstyle I have now realized. I would later get a lot more agressive and hard read heavy in playstyle. 

Secondary: 

A lot of my secondaries in SC secondaries could be listed as well:
- Raph in multiple games I already mentioned, I also liked Yoda and Vader.  
- Because I mained SC2 Nightmare I always have a pocket Siegfried as well in every game.

But yeah. I usually end up being kind of a tier whore. Like I said it's usually just because they have more better options and feel more fun because of that."

My understanding is that UCF fixes this to add another frame to where it will trigger the dashback instead of just turning around and doing nothing or an ""empty pivot"".

It also makes shield dropping easier if you do the angle method. 

For the most part those two things have worked for me fine. However I have one controller that doesn't seem to get the same benefit and it's almost like the UCF doesn't really work on it for the dashbacks.

Some people have told me that I need to do it faster, that the ""worse"" controller I have been using just has different timing than my old one that I was used to and the smash 4 one that I tried, and that's why I have a problem on that controller specifically.

So yeah when your neutral is way better than your opponents, and they don't know your tricks, you can rack up damage pretty effectively.

But when you face a really strong player, they will know the tricks. Now you have to win neutral way more than they do in order to get the same damage. 

That won't go in your favour. If every time we reset and you try something, I mash one of the counter options, eventually I'm gonna trade or win neutral out of your reset. Any trade is going to be way worse for you because you play Sheik. 

If I actually read you, you're probably in for a hard punish. This hurts 2 fold because Sheik is so light that she's basically made of paper anyway, so losing neutral just a few times will lose you stocks and games.

A different playstyle would force me to do something else and not just use the same method of counterplay over and over. Sheik can't really do that."
SmashRage,ffaa9ra,t1_ff9zzjc,1579730948.0,"Ok, so here are the issues:

Your list is great. Could organize it by category or something with headers ""Confims"" ""Combos"" ""Tech"", etc. 

But overall besides the organization you have a lot of good info. You've probably assembled the biggest and best list of all Sheik tech in Ult. 

That's great, you obviously put a lot of time and energy into both the character and that list. 

But....

It's Sheik... 

A lot of those confirms were cool, but are you going to be able to land them at the exact % you need? 

Sweet spot down tilt isn't reliable. Microspacing doesn't work in Ult like in past games. You can't hit it reliably to get your best confirms. Good opponents will constantly move to a distance where it won't work. You'll get them sometimes sure, but like Marth, not consistently enough to be a great character.

Her throws all rely on DI in which makes them useless. A good player will know that and always DI out. Now if everyone could be edgegaurded that would be fine because she would gimp you for DI out, but in Ult that isn't the case. Many characters can get back before she can edgegaurd them, or circumvent her edgegaurding anyway with their broken recoveries, or have mixups at the very least. 

A lot of the needle setups rely on precision spacing and timing, and have tight % windows. Why am I not just going to shield when she jumps at me with her safe aerials and needles in those % windows? What stops me from doing that agaisnt her and just not dying?

The drag down stuff is neat, the jab setup is neat. I know a lot about Ult competitively and Sheik specifically, and I didn't know about the jab into down tilt. 

But that still loses to shield, and if I get to a high enough % I'll be outside the widow where that works anyway. I can also jump to avoid it a lot and just land with safe aerials. But it's something. 

A lot of the floaties, or even characters who aren't heavies or fast fallers, will escape from a lot of those little setups or won't actually die when they are true. 

&nbsp;

Is Sheik a low tier? No, absolutely not. 

But is she a great character? I don't think so. 

The reality is that if you use all that tech perfectly, know all your confirms, etc, she might be low high tier or the top of mid tier. 

But she's so hard. Hard enough even the Sheik players known for their smash 4 tech skill can't use her against players of their caliber. 

As a player who is playing multiple high/top tiers, I can pretty much just shield agaisnt her, eat her mixups, and watch out for her confirms and just not die. 

She has to get some crazy hard confirms and spacing and stuff to kill me. I just have to land a bair or dash attack. 

She's super light, only one of my characters is even close to as light as her. So gambling is always in my favour, and she can't afford to mess up. 

&nbsp;

Depending on what you like about her, there are better characters at doing what she wants to do, and what she wanted to do in past games. 

- Pika
- Joker
- Lucina
- Chrom
- ZSS 
- Wolf 

Depending on how you like to play her, and what things you enjoy the most about her, one or two of those characters will fit those same aspects but be way better at it. 

I had Sheik as a secondary in Smash 4 before 1.16 killed her for me. I get it. Sheik is super fun, she's fast and can combo, and go crazy deep for gimps and it's fun.

But the bitter reality is that fun /= good. Especially in Ult. 

&nbsp;

Now if you're not super try hard and just like playing Sheik, that's great, enjoy her. Hope she gets buffed. 

But until she gets some specific buffs to make her be a threat of killing you semi-reliably, I'm just gonna hold shield and win trades with her until I kill her with any attack I have that kills by itself, because I know she can't kill me reliably enough that I have to do anything else. 

It's a simple gameplan, and unfortunately for Sheik it's way too effective agaisnt her when playing a top/high tier."
SmashRage,ff9zaz4,t1_ff9ywkl,1579724710.0,"You can show it to me sure. 

Thing is, I know that Void and Mr.R probably know everything you're going to show me, and I know how it went for them when they tried her. Very badly. 

So if they are still complaining about her not being able to kill, I don't think anything you have is going to help.

It's either going to be too niche to be practical, very character dependent, or not work agaisnt a lot of important matchups to be good. 

That's what I'm thinking anyway. I'll look at it, hell I might even be able to argue why some of it doesn't work to prove my point further."
SmashRage,ff9y2h2,t1_ff9xkg8,1579723985.0,"In Ult? M8. C'mon. Even Mr.R and Void say she can't kill. 

The only thing they argue she doesn't need is more damage. Even they want her kill power buffed. 

What is she gonna do to kill me? 

A raw smash attack at 150%?

Fair bouncing fish when it won't kill? 

Needles bouncing fish offstage because I somehow got knocked off that far? 

Up air ridiculously close to the ceiling? 

Bair if she gets the good hitbox and has also knocked me really far offstage for it to work? 

Yeah those are great kill options right there. Those are definitely things I have to be afraid of, and totally can't just spam shield and not be an idiot and survive against.

Do you think I'm playing a low tier like Ganon that you can just gimp whenever you want?"
SmashRage,ff9wzsg,t1_ff90148,1579723333.0,"In smash 4 Sheik had multiple playstyles, still not as much as a Melee character, but still a decent amount of depth.

In Ultimate she doesn't. Her combo game got drastically reduced, most top/high tiers still can't be consistently edgegaurded, and she can't kill. She also lost a lot of setups and her grab confirms which added a ton of depth in how she could play. 

So most top/high tiers treat her like a shitty Lucina essentially. 

Most of her aerials are safe, and she just wants to edgegaurd you. 

So she's going to play quite safe and try to whiff punish you, trying to knock you off and get an edgegaurd. Unlike Lucina she can't actually kill you though, but she can charge needles which..... don't do much. She can't do anything about your shield either unlike Lucina who has low % combos and a shield breaker. 

All needles can really do is set up a confirm into bouncing fish, which is great and all, but she has to get the setup first and usually it won't kill so she has to finish the edgegaurd anyway. So playing campy doesn't work either. 

&nbsp;

So the gameplan agaisnt her doesn't really change:

Shield, don't throw out dumb stuff that she can whiff punish for free. Watch out for the % she can get her confirms, don't try to challenge her after her aerials because they are safe, her grab does nothing so holding shield is fine. Don't recovery in a lazy way because she will always try to edgegaurd you because it's the only way she can kill you.

&nbsp;

No matter what the Sheik wants to do, that gameplan wins. She doesn't have the depth to stop that from working:

She can't play for pressure and combos like Void used to because she doesn't get anything from it. 

She can't play to rack up damage safely into a kill confirm like Mr.R because she doesn't have any consistent confirms that work on everyone. 

She has to play in a whiff punish style more like Zero, but she can't really force an approach with needles because her getting damage on you doesn't mean anything, so she can't actually force the approaches and therefore whiffs that she needs. 

&nbsp;

She's only a few buffs away from having a high amount of depth and being very strong, but that isn't going to happen. Sakurai has a personal agenda against Sheik at this point. 

The closest we are going to get to a strong Sheik is Joker. He's not exactly the same, but he's similar and has a fair bit of depth using the same styles Sheik could play I'm Smash 4, just in a different way."
SmashRage,ff8mdgn,t3_es8uyn,1579685695.0,"That's not pros fault, that's ult being limited. 

Because of ults mechanics, the combos are a lot more set in stone than any time in smashes history. 

This also locks the majority of cast into more limited playstyles. 

This is compounded by the fact the dev team has deliberately tried to nerf characters who have multiple strengths, and push all characters strengths into a specific niche. 

This leaves a lot less ways to play each character, especially in most matchups. 

Most characters have a set gameplan or 2 that works against 85% of the cast. 

It's only the top/high tiers that actually have some depth that allow for more creativity and force the opponent to swap styles because they can swap styles on the fly. 

Leffen had it pretty accurately: there is more ways to play just Fox alone in Melee than there is to play most of the roster in Ultimate. 

Having all those options in one just ultimately allows more playstyles than the extremely limited and specialized characters we have now."

Though the ""competitive"" ult sub crazy hand, banned me because I don't subscribe to their ""everyone is good and fine and we shouldn't dislike any character"" bullshit philosophy.

Just because I can beat Ness consistently because I'm a good player, doesn't mean I don't think he's a degenerate who is overall bad for the game. Same with G&W. 

The way you have to play agaisnt them isn't fun because they remove counterplay. Telling someone that will actually help them a lot in that matchup ""no, you don't get to play like you normally would. He gets to up b whenever he wants and if you ever touch his shield he's gonna do it. It's degenerate as hell, but that's how it is"".

SmashRage,ff4kohz,t1_ff40nos,1579565939.0,"Lol it's obviously just how you pick characters.

People do one of two things with their characters:

They pick characters they think look cool

Or 

They pick characters that fit their playstyle.

Now obviously as you try different styles and learn more about the game and explore more, especially when you've been playing for multiple games, you'll have a bigger roster that you can play than a newer player. 

&nbsp;

But since you said you were trying to learn the game with Ryu, I assumed ult is probably your first smash, or at least the first one you're trying to play more competitive in. 

So I just suggested some other similar characters in playstyle because that's what I think you should be looking for, you just happened to find them already lol. 

&nbsp;

A lot of people also just see a top tier character and pick them because they are a top tier, but that's also really bad. 

Yes you want to play a top/high tier, but you want to play the strongest character *that you can actually play*. Picking a character that fits what you want to do is more important than their overall strength, especially at low-mid level. 

So even if you go down from the best character to the 11th best, if you'll be a better player with that character instead, that's the one you should be playing."

Yeah definitely. Online is cancer.

>Also I main Megaman so forcing her to get around me is pretty much my best option.

Zone her. Beat her to death with retreating lemons every time she approaches. Leaf shield to stop her from getting in. Shoryu for your big whiff punish. F-smash for your hard read on her dashing at you. Bair/fair for your air to air/edegaurd setup."
SmashRage,ff49d9k,t1_ff2w6js,1579558390.0,"Yeah. 

Basically when the game came out, approaching was good because they didn't really have any defensive options or projectiles to stop you.

All you had to worry about was if they swung pre-emptively, and if they did you could whiff punish them.

But then they added the dodge as more than just a neutral air dodge/spot dodge like it started as.

Someone got on a melee kick and said: ""what if the neutral airdodge/spotdodge could also move you forward like a roll, but as fast as a wavedash? That can't be broken at all right?""

Now instead of smash 4 style frame traps, or Melee punishes, you get neither.

You just get to spam a super fast intangible movement ability on the ground and in the air, and if you dodge their attack with it, you get a free punish.

So now approaching sucks and all you want to do is zone and camp and dodge a ton.

If you enjoy them for their footsies you might enjoy Chrom. He gets to weave in and out but he can punish a lot more options and play more safely because of his sword.

She has to play agaisnt some characters differently, but it usually fits into archtypes that go with a basic understanding of the game. 

Projectiles: get past their projectiles, space sword, try to edgegaurd, punish whiffs. 

Rushdown: Outspace, pre-emptive strikes, punish whiffs hard for confirms and edgegaurds. 

Turtle/floaty: Approach with sword safely, try to edgegaurd, try to force attacks you can punish. Swat the fly until dead. 

Footsies/bait and punish: Don't throw laggy shit, very little pre-emptive, very safe starters, try to edgegaurd. 

One of those 4 game plans will cover 99% of the cast, and even  those game plans have a fair bit of crossover. 

The most depth comes in a matchup that forces you to do contradictory things. 

Pika and Joke for example, can both rush you down, and bait and punish you, and projectile zone you. 

So you want to go in against their zoning, but you don't want to throw shit they can punish, but sometimes you have to swing to keep *them* from rushing you. 

Then it's all about the mind games and outplaying your opponent.

That's when Lucina becomes one of the most fun to play characters.

But most characters in ult don't have that much depth. 

Leffen was right when he said that there are more ways to play just Fox in Melee as a character than there are to play most of the roster in Ult. 

Because of this, she doesn't have to change her gameplan against anyone who isn't a good character with multiple good playstyles, who is also being piloted by a good player.

That's why she's better as a secondary. You'll find few matches will meet all of those conditions to be fun. But sometimes you need a consistent gameplan that you can execute in a matchup your main is having trouble with. 

Pika gets screwed by Ness, Bowser gets comboed to death easily, Wolf can't edgegaurd him that well, and neither can Chrom. 

So if I have a Lucina, I'll use her. It's an easy gameplan, get past his dumb shit, gimp his ass. Win game. In matchups like that, that's all I want. 

That's why she's good to learn the game, and a secondary used by a lot of top players, especially when they really want a consistent character to deal with some jank their main can't handle. Leo uses her for that, Proto, and others."

SmashRage,ff2mk1l,t3_er1uu0,1579513400.0,"You're fighting bad players compared to yourself if you're stomping with her that hard. 

Lucina has a very strong neutral game and edgegaurds/ledge traps. 

But her punish game is just decent, and her combo game is nearly nonexistent (though her juggles are decent). She has higher than average lag on whiff so she is quite susceptible to whiff punishing, and her landing options are garbage. 

She's essentially the most honest top/high tier character.

But because of that, if the opponent is worse than you in neutral and their punish isn't great, you will absolutely dominate them.

But when you're good, and you are fighting a player as skilled as yourself, with a better punish game that they can actually execute well, then the real game starts. 

- Can you win neutral more times than they do to make up for their punish game being better? 
- Can you get a risky edgegaurd to have to win much less neutral exchanges? 
- Can you do both of those without getting whiff punished with your much higher than average end lag for anything that you miss, and terrible landing options?

That's what playing Lucina is. 

&nbsp;

Now is it fun? Well that's subjective. Depends on what you find fun. Some people find Snake and Ness fun, those people are cancer IMO. Their opinion is wrong. 

Lucina does get pretty boring IMO, and I mained Marth in every game but Ult.

Because she is very honest and basic, she doesn't have much variety. She also doesn't really combo either, so it's very much just doing the same things over and over, punishing their mistakes and playing basic mind games. 

You don't get the extensions and frame traps you did with Marth in older games, or someone like Chrom or Wolf who use disjoints in a similar but often more agressive way. 

That's also why she falls off as anything but a secondary. At a certain level you just run out of shit you can do with her, and the other characters just have more they can do to make key plays and comebacks. 

She's a great secondary if you can use her well. She's great to learn the fundamentals of smash with for a newer player or a player looking to improve their fundamentals quickly.

To look at your characters moves, OOS options, and what is safe and not safe on shield. 

Remember that short hop aerials do less shield and hit stun, and charged smash attacks will do more shield and hit stun. 

Agaisnt most of the cast, -5 to -6 or lower is completely safe on shield at any range, and -15 to -20 can also be safe if spaced with a disjoint or when you cross up the opponents shield. 

Now being safe isn't the same as being in advantage. That doesn't mean you get to swing another slow attack or aerial. It means that if you shield you'll be safe except against grab, you can spotdodge any grabs, and if you dashback you can't get hit.

Inkling gets some special privilege in that your dash dance makes your body super small in the puddle. This makes it so you will dodge most of the fastest OOS options. This means you get to be even more - on shield and still be fine compared to any other character just by dashing back. 

When you know something you did is a fair bit unsafe, unlike most characters who want to shield, more often than not your best bet as Inkling is actually to dash back, hope they whiff, and if they do, dash back in and punish them for it. You can even use that when a move is safe if they like to use their OOS option to punish everything. 

Now that won't work in matchups like G&W or the Mario's or stuff like that because they have busted OOS options, so you have to only go for your safe stuff. 

Inkling does have quite a few safe aerials though:

Nair will be safe when full hopped even agaisnt Mario and G&W, watch out if you short hop or stail it though as it can become unsafe agaisnt them. 

Agaisnt everyone else though you can pretty much spam it to hell and they won't be able to punish it. If they do try just dash back to make them whiff and dash back in with a punish.

Bair works similarly, it's safe against like 90% of the cast all the time, especially when spaced. If you space it, even if you stail it you should still be safe. Again you can dash dance and punish a whiff, or grab them and throw them into a worse positon, use one of your combo throws.

Fair can be safe a lot of the time, but you have to space it at max range and land quickly. It's more of a mixup as you won't be safe enough to grab or anything, but you can shield or preferably dash dance and bait a punish attempt from the opponent.

Landing up air can be safe, but it's not the most useful option. You can use it as a mixup or to pressure from below without worrying about getting punished. 

Dair is super niche but can be same in some cases when not stail and from a full hop. Most times it won't be that useful, but at select % you can combo it into an up air or bair, or bait and airdodge and roller/smash them, so you might want to use it then. It's just barely safe agaisnt some characters though, and not safe at all against others, so be very careful when you use that. 

Inklings other best approach besides her aerials is grab. Not only does she have great combo throws, her forward and back throw set up strong edgegaurding situations which she excels in. 

Because of her busted dash dance she can go in whenever she wants from a dash dance and the opponent won't be able to react at all if you're spaced at the right distance.

Hope that helps."
SmashRage,ff118g5,t1_feyqzu6,1579474249.0,"If you're having a problem with OOS it's either your spacing is bad or your character choice leaves you with little to no safe approach tools.

Who do you play?"

- Pika
- Joker
- Wolf
- Palu

Reflect/dodge their spam and spam them back. 

Why do you think characters like these are the most popular mains and secondaries at top level? 

Because they can deal with the extremely defensive game mid-high level ult becomes. They don't have to deal with the spam and can spam people back for trying it.

&nbsp;

Now if you just want to get past the spam and have the best options to get in and stay in, you pick some faster characters who can go in with multiple safe/strong options. 

The problem is that the online this is the hardest playstyle because you can't react effectively to get your whiff punishes/rushdown pressure. 

You'll notice these are also very popular at top level as mains and secondaries because they are stronger offline at high level. 

- Chrom
- Roy
- ZSS 
- Fox 
- Wolf but played agressive 
- Lucina 
- Inkling

The character you chose to play as, plays the biggest role in what the opponent can effectively do to you. 

If you're playing Ganon, spam will work very well agaisnt you because he can't do anything about it. 

Most of the cast gets beat by spam. 

To be high/top tier you have to have a way to beat the spam. You have to be able to get in, and punish the opponent effectively. Usually this is with disjoints, speed, safety, a great projectile, reflector, etc. A combination of those. 

Then the cream of the crop characters are the ones who can no only do that, but are also good at fighting the other characters who can do that. 

That's how you find the strongest characters in any smash game. The requirements don't really change, if anything they have just gotten more strict in each iteration."
gaming,fexf34q,t3_eqsylp,1579429954.0,"The things about the steam controller is that it had so much potential, but was held back by multiple factors:

- It was quite expensive compared to other controllers 

- The mapping and adjusting was difficult and frustrating for most players who just want to get into their game. The running theme of ""bette in theory, worse in practicality"" starts here. 

- The touchpad while good in theory, forced the player to re-learn how to do everything they would normally have done with stick. The potential minor benefits isn't worth trying to re-learn 5-30 years of muscle memory most gamers have on sticks. 

- The pad still wasn't as good as or as accurate as a mouse, which is really the controllers only competition. No one cares if you're slightly better than a controller. Real competitive players will just move to mouse because they know it's the best unless it's console exclusive (which pretty much no competitive games are anymore anyway).

- It's design and layout were offputting to a lot of people. Again, while theoretically better, no one is used to that design and layout, and most people don't like switching on that at all. 

- The extra large d-pad may have looked good for the style of the controller, but actually wasn't as great in application as a mid size normal d-pad, espresso with the inner curve messing with certain inputs, and large size requiring much more movement for the same results. 

Overall the steam controller is just another case of wasted potential IMO. It could have massively improved the controller design world. Instead it made a mediocre tool that needed to have everything specified in order to even be remotely better than a controller. 

Disappointing."
