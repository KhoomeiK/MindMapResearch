When Trump continued the train, suddenly everyone was against it and started calling him a monster. All Trump has been doing is continuing what the Democrats started but taking the blame for an issue that both sides were collectively working towards.

If the argument was that it was always wrong to do so, then what exactly would be a better alternative to 30,000 people who come here illegally each month?

I already ride in public transportation, don’t have children and can’t eat bread. It would be incredibly *difficult* to accomplish the list I just made, but if you want to get rid of CEO’s and their “evil” ways, you would need to convince other consumers to do the same. Since that basically isn’t going to happen, you will always have this system of commerce. People who buy products are directly putting money into the company and how it interacts with the consumer. 

You could always open your business to compete with the corporation but if you are too successful, you would end up as a rich CEO too. Maybe CEO’s should invest back into their company more. That would make more sense to me."

unpopularopinion,fcg1snl,t1_fcfq6k6,1577635722.0,"The consumer literally has all the power as businesses run on getting more consumers. A business cannot function without giving a product at a reputable price. If people really wanted to take out a business, all they have to do is not buy the products that the business provides. It’s not that the average joe is greedy. It’s more like the average joe doesn’t have the time or money to do it themselves and pay for someone else to do it for them. 

Should businesses provide better wages? Sure. That factor is entirely dependent on the number of consumers that purchase the product and the investors that only care about profit margins. How much money would be the bare minimum for you if you ran a company with thousands of employees that all need at least $40,000 a month to survive?  Do you think CEO’s last long if they sit on their ass and bask in money? No. They need to work ridiculous hours and keep up with strategic marketing and positive public opinion. Are they worth 1 billion? I feel like Bill Gates is definitely worth that as he provided machines that accessed the entire internet for the entire world population. 

So to recap, if the average joe wants to stop multimillionaire CEO’s from being a thing, all they need to do is stop buying that company’s product."

If she says, “I really wish I could date a guy *just* like you*,” what she really means is, “I love your personality but I’m not attracted to your looks.”

This does not make you ugly to *all* women. You’re probably not ugly, but you’re simply not the aesthetics that she is into. Much like how some men only go after big boobs or big butts or a pretty face, except most preferences that women have for physical appearance has nothing to do with dick size. 

Women give really obscure hints because there are a lot of animal guys out there that make them scared to say no outright, so they try to beat around the bush in hopes that you will leave them alone. If a woman really wants to be around you, she will try and hang around you. Seriously though, she will go out of her way to hang out with you and try to hint at random shit she likes, hoping *you* will ask her out to go do these activities *with* her. 

Her: I really like this, (band, team, movie, restaurant, etc.) what about you?

What you usually say: Yeah it’s pretty cool...

What you should attempt to say regardless of the outcome: Oh hey, you like that (band, team, movie, restaurant, etc.)? Me too! I usually go alone, but you should come with me next time. I bet it will be really fun.

She'd been dreaming lubed up sex dolls 

And she begged for thots to show 

But she just copped her medication 

And she measured out a quarter through her nose 

Bending down her little whores and 

Grabbed the cream and dumped a tad 

Leaving lube prints on her forehead 

Gram been licking gaping dark spots from they're cracks

Grandmas not done no her eyes are tweakers 

Lots of smoking out that crystal she

Truly makes it known what she wants and it's 

The glass that she can slam and tweak a weak

Out near all those pounds is grandma 

She's been shaking fists so well 

Leaving when theres thots to hook up 

She brings here and plays with shards end up in cells 

Pissed off bitch got pinned down slammed on 

Walls then gran caressed her ass 

And she jumped but felt a wonder 

Took it slow undid her zip 

Whore bent her ass (then surpassed)

Grandmas not what most learn bout a tweaker 

Stalking hoes around town missing sleep 

Two hands lay where no such thing has landed 

What ass can she get hands on squeeze and leave

Found the truth in all the fables 

And it's good it's made it in 

Grandmas loose somewhere unhandled 

Last took was glass stashed upstairs in grandma's crib 

Tried more calls I meant to take whores 

Met they're all out for more help 

They looked better than what I did 

Losing gram my fight won't stray 

Hand waved and yelled

 Walking so unbalanced with a lean 

Losing grey hairs oh fuck bring her tramps a 

Butt ass whore she can sample bring to me 

Bring it hands on

Walk to go on out for crystal she 

Took the way there no luck meeting man the

alcoholism,fbxw15a,t3_eez7a1,1577201981.0,"Alcoholism is not simple, but I do have a simple phrase to identify what happens to every alcoholic at a certain point. 

You drink for fun, then you drink for fun with problems, then you drink with just problems. 

Becoming sober is relearning how to live life. Life will still continue to be challenging with really low lows and really amazing highs. It will continue to shove obstacles in your face that you must overcome. The difference is that you are actively working on solving those issues instead of running away from them and numbing the pain. 

You have learned what every alcoholic goes through. “Life still sucks right now, why even be sober?” Because drinking simply makes it worse. You wake up the next day remembering all the problems you tried to drink away. You feel guilty and worthless that you let another day be wasted by not taking action to try and fix it. You can’t face that new pain that you have created and the vicious, cruel cycle repeats. 

Sobriety doesn’t make the pain go away. It teaches you how to cope differently. The main lesson right now is that you understand that it simply is slightly less shitty when you are sober. That’s fine for now. Because the sobriety takes time. You live in the moment, day by day. I don’t think about next year, or next month, or next week, or even tomorrow. My main goal at this junction is to just not drink today. I’m 46 days sober again as I relapsed after 110 consecutive days and it’s the toughest thing I have ever had to do. But at least everything else seems easier by comparison. Not taking that first drink is more difficult than finishing school or fixing my car or maintaining my relationships or paying rent COMBINED for me. The one thing that sobriety has given me so far, is the ability to see how far I have come and be proud in the little things I accomplish. 

I still have anxiety about the future and I still have some depression, but it has significantly improved since becoming sober and making it one more day. Think about how long you have been drinking and realize that it might take those amount of years sober to be back to the point before you started. That is not something that should scare you, but also realize that you physically had to drink one day at a time to get to this point. So now you have to abstain one day at a time.

What happened to me was what the alcoholic mind does to you. It plays tricks on you. *I made it 3 months... did I REALLY have a problem? Let me check to make sure...* and boom, all my progress was gone. Yes, I do have a problem. 

Remember, you’re not a bad guy. You are sick. And you are working to become well again. You have made mistakes. We all do. Sobriety is like antibiotics. You have to take the antibiotics until the infection goes away. If you stop before the infection is gone, the infection comes right back. 

I wish you the best my man. It does get better, it just takes time. Little by little. Day by day."

I have stood up to every member of my family except her, because well, I just can’t. I don’t think she would excommunicate me or love me any less, but I respect her and can’t justify doing something like that.

That’s all I said. I guess you find it sexier to have your partner to stumble around in the dark with your junk and hope for the best. Which is a perfectly fine strategy but not one that I want in order to try and satisfy her.
