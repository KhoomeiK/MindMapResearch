EDAnonymous,ffwmiq7,t1_ffukq11,1580305550.0,I saw a glance and immediately looked away. I love boba so much. If I give it a second of thought I’ll cry.
EDAnonymous,ffwm61v,t3_evid0p,1580305266.0,"I looked at pictures of myself just from last year and I’m jealous.. I’m no longer as thin as I used to be and I called myself fat. 

Now I actually am fat and I’m stuck in a loop. Starve all day, eat a shit ton at night, then take pills to fall asleep because I can’t deal with my inability to resist."
schizophrenia,ff9sn2p,t3_es4nfq,1579720366.0,"Oh yeah. Definitely. And I just try really hard to smile and act like I’m sympathizing because I could never understand how hard life must be for someone who’s not used to hardship on a day to day basis. 

Reminds me of children who are experiencing uncomfortable emotions for the first time."
lingling40hrs,ff9s270,t3_esauai,1579719953.0,Oh I’ve learned to just ignore everything from a young age. Nothing gets between me and my instrument.
RATS,ff8na0e,t1_fdhr0gj,1579687090.0,"I know right! Makes them look a little more adorable, to me personally."
rarepuppers,ff5o97p,t1_ff4pk3r,1579602935.0,"Yes it’s a personal choice, but a personal choice shouldn’t negatively affect a life of another. 

Individuals who cannot properly support rescues should not get them. It’ll lead to both lives suffering. Obviously the owner of this rescue was very committed and had a wonderful outcome. Not all people are fit to do that. It’s a lot of work, time, effort, and money. 

It’s not something to be ashamed of. Being responsible and considerate of a dog’s life is something that should be supported."
rarepuppers,ff5o4lf,t3_erj16e,1579602745.0,"Only adopt if experienced, have a really good friend/family member, responsible enough for a rescue, and/or the money to afford dog training. 

Only shop to support reputable breeders/breeding, know exactly what you want(for various reasons on a spectrum), are responsible enough for the specified dog breed you’re getting, and/or can afford dog training. 

I do not support the “Don’t” in “adopt don’t shop.” 

Too many people get rescues because they’re cheap and think it’s like getting any other dog. They don’t realize pedigrees are very important and reputable/responsible breeding is not a bad thing at all. 

Not to hate on rescues. You just have to be prepared and understand that you’re getting a rescue that may not have any background, so please only adopt dogs that you believe you gave the capabilities to own. Different dogs require different people."
ehlersdanlos,fdodx71,t1_fdmnp3q,1578603348.0,"I did see someone else mention they got a used one to test out and it helped them out. I did not know this was even an option so I’ll definitely consider it and check them out. 

And it’ll be nice, as you said, to actually test it out and see how it feels. I’ve only been pushed around in a wheelchair. It definitely helped preserve energy so I could be out majority of the day. (Mostly at amusement parks such as Disneyland/Disneyworld) 

I’ve never really had good experience being alone with a wheelchair and seeing if I’d be able to push myself which was another thought. I don’t know how I’ll do if my hands end up cramping. 

Thank you again for the suggestion. I think it’s a really good idea to test it out for myself before I can make a good judgement on whether if they’ll truly help or not."
ehlersdanlos,fdkuuxn,t1_fdkthra,1578511631.0,"You’re right. We just joke a lot. I don’t think they’d ever joke about it, but just the stigma of being a part time user or the fact that I’m not paralyzed or whatever.. it’s a sensitive topic for me despite having to grow up with it and I’m not good at telling people when it’s a sensitive topic. “Fear of vulnerability” and whatnot. So I’ll have to figure that out eventually anyways."
ehlersdanlos,fdkmrv0,t1_fdkluch,1578506799.0,"Personally I’d consider atrophy and judgement from familiar people as my worst consequences/cons. 

But sort of similar to your situation, I’m already pretty weak which is why I feel like, although atrophy will happen, doing the minimum amount of swimming exercise would be enough to stay at my current weakness level or similar to. 

I’m worried about judgement because I don’t openly discuss my health with familiar people.. the only one who really knows everything is my wife. Honestly the only person that matters to me haha, but I occasionally meet up with a group of friends like once a year. Rarely we go out, but when we do usually I’m the fastest walker, most active, making people laugh... they haven’t seen how bad I’ve gotten and I feel like they’d be unable to understand how bad it is, so appearing in a wheelchair to them makes me a bit.. hesitant. I tried hiding the fact that I use canes and knee braces. It just screwed me over bad in the end. 

Thank you for the suggestion and relatable words. I really appreciate your response.

Edit: minimum sounds like I avoid it, or barely anything. My minimum is sort of my maximum. I try to at least go 2-3 times a week. I call that my minimum requirement even though if I were to do four times, it would be pushing it. Oops."
LeagueOfMemes,fdexqyn,t1_fdexll3,1578348835.0,"Damn. That sucks, I’m sorry. I’ve had a bad laptop to where ping was so bad it was like that to the thousands randomly. Unplayable and so frustrating.. so I can relate."
LeagueOfMemes,fdewhzh,t1_fde7ohs,1578348055.0,"You can look it up on google and get the site directly from riot. You should see Ziggs I believe. You’ll need to enter your main account that has honor level 3, at least. (I could have sworn when I made mine you needed level 5, but I may be wrong. The site will tell you what honour level you need.) 

Once you’re approved which happens within seconds. (You don’t need to check your email or anything.) Then you make a new account on the site except now that account will be able to access PBE servers. You can use your same username and stuff unless someone already took them since PBE is a separate server from live."
LeagueOfMemes,fdew7t5,t1_fdelz3h,1578347886.0,Ahh I see. I did not know the PBE was not spread out at least to majority of the regions.
LeagueOfMemes,fdew5k8,t1_fddr9xa,1578347849.0,"Then my comment just informed them. 

And honour 3 is not that hard to get at all as long as you’re not a super toxic player haha. Even one of my friends who’s pretty toxic toward everyone in game actually managed to get honour level 3 or 4."
LeagueOfMemes,fddc4ro,t1_fddbujr,1578305061.0,"I’m seeing a lot of people disliked someone else saying PBE was an option. I don’t see what’s wrong with needing another account. I can understand that’s sometimes a bother, but from personal experience it’s not. I only use PBE for testing stuff out so I’m not trying to get massive amount of items, therefore the occasional one game if I want to test out a skin is completely fine for me."
LeagueOfMemes,fdd967c,t1_fdb8r6j,1578300616.0,I think it would be ignored because PBE basically lets you do this already.
LeagueOfMemes,fdd955j,t3_ekgvql,1578300573.0,You could just make a PBE account. All champs are free to play and cost 1 Blue Essence. RP is basically free. You get 3000 for playing a game per day.
dogswithjobs,fcwhhqs,t1_fcwhcu8,1578025751.0,"I see you can’t read either. I never said anything like that. I’m not going to repeat myself. I’m just going to let you stay angry and believe you’re right. 

Can’t help a dumb person if they don’t want to learn."
AskReddit,fcwhe05,t3_ej3pte,1578025675.0,"Carbs are why you’re fat. False. 

Old dogs can’t learn new tricks. False. 

Every wheelchair user is unable to use their legs. False."
dogswithjobs,fcwh57r,t1_fcwgxyz,1578025493.0,"Yeah. You have no eyes. 

This post clearly states the dog is an ESA accompanying her handler on a plane which is completely legal. 

You and many other people are so quick to assume people are fakes or trying to abuse the system. I’m not saying there aren’t any people who are abusing the system, however, there are genuine people out there who do need their ESA just like how people out there do need their SDs."
dogswithjobs,fcwh030,t1_fcwgwm9,1578025387.0,"Yep. It’s pretty frustrating and makes other handlers look bad. They yell that fake service dogs make real service dog teams look bad, but honestly they’re no better. Yelling and throwing terms I bet they don’t even fully understand."
dogswithjobs,fcw2g24,t3_eiu58b,1578015593.0,Good job OP. Upsetting those “fake service dog police.” They seem to have no eyes and only know the law that conveniences THEM.
dogswithjobs,fcw2c3e,t1_fcuyznn,1578015521.0,"The owner literally just said she takes her dog on the plane and not public buildings. Did you not read? 

This owner is not doing anything illegal. You’re being a pest."
dogswithjobs,fcw26kk,t1_fctqqhr,1578015421.0,"This person is not doing anything illegal and seems to know her rights. The dog is an ESA and is legally allowed on planes if the owner provides a letter. 

The owner did not say anything about taking her ESA in public places. No need to freak out and start an issue when there never was an issue to begin with. 

Also, not all SD handlers are blind. You should take the time to educate yourself instead of ranting like you’re the service dog police."
dogswithjobs,fcw1sy9,t1_fcv8cbv,1578015172.0,None of your business really. She shared this photo with a tag that says her dog is a service dog. You don’t need anymore information.
SuicideWatch,fcpgz1o,t3_eifdx9,1577863599.0,"Because apparently we have a chemical imbalance. 

Are they sure their “chemical balance” is just their primal desire to stay alive and then applying deeper meaning to it?"
fightporn,fc3doz7,t1_fc3dke0,1577387509.0,Hahaha.
