If you ask him, he will gladly tell you he does half the work in the house...half the chores, half the child raising, etc."
Affairs,ffdtck1,t3_et0lqc,1579828427.0,Had greatest luck on Ashley Madison. But...female. And before the hack.

The chef came out to congratulate him on knowing how to eat steak."
DeadBedrooms,ffcurhx,t1_ffceehz,1579807673.0,It’s...lacking. Yeah.
DeadBedrooms,ffcumy8,t1_ffcrwzp,1579807599.0,Agreed. Coming at it from a DB situation is far far less than ideal and works more to preserve the status quo than to make any meaningful improvements to the foundation of the marriage.
DeadBedrooms,ffcqdhr,t1_ffcpluk,1579805030.0,"True. Although a roommate who covers much of the cost of living. He has a tech sector job and makes 2-3x what I do. He also is easy to get along with, pinch hits with the kids when necessary, and is chill with an open marriage, so...there are deep advantages to that, too."
DeadBedrooms,ffcq54m,t1_ffco70s,1579804876.0,"Right? He married me because he believed no one else would. So he put very few parameters on it, and ended up with someone who doesn’t share his hobbies, interests, kinks or who embodies what he finds attractive."
DeadBedrooms,ffcph3k,t1_ffcl9wf,1579804437.0,"Yep. Full time job. 

We basically don’t see him, that’s all. About an hour a day for dinner. Two hours (lunch and dinner) on weekends."
DeadBedrooms,ffcetb2,t1_ffcd77a,1579797925.0,"His response to such statements was always: 

“You’re just trying to control my life!” 

“You just wish you had a hobby you loved as much! You’re jealous.”

“You don’t know how to relax or have fun! You’re so uptight!” 

Yeah, maybe cause one of us has to be the adult in this marriage, eh? 

As a friend of mine said...got all then responsibilities of being single with none of the benefits; and I have all the responsibilities of being married with none of the benefits."
adultery,ffceeia,t1_ffbzdqf,1579797669.0,"I know, that’s why I apologized up front. The bluntness and disconnect made me wonder. Many, many people online have asked if my spouse is on the spectrum based on some of his behaviors. He has never had such a diagnosis, but both his mom and my son have exhibited signs like hand-flapping and such, so I believe it could exist at a low level and not be caught. Especially for adults who have already managed their way through the system."
DeadBedrooms,ffce5qw,t1_ffc81kl,1579797519.0,"Exactly. He won’t admit it, but this, 100%."
DeadBedrooms,ffce2j5,t1_ffbnnjl,1579797465.0,"Work 9-5, game 7-2 or 3 am. Occasionally 4 am."

DeadBedrooms,ffbx166,t1_ffbkfsu,1579785542.0,"Oh yeah. He essentially addicted my son, too. The kid has his same mind...their brains work similarly. 

I hate it, but what’re you going to do? Kid is 18."

adultery,ffb9z65,t1_ffaqchb,1579756764.0,Not like he’s gonna wear a sign.
adultery,ffb9mi4,t1_ffabeh8,1579756333.0,"Hang on hang on, I want to defend Martini, here... 

My husband thinks I’m awful in bed. A terrible lay. Basically human oatmeal, and literally not worth the effort. He has literally said, “The ROI isn’t worth it.” 

My boyfriend has a 180 degree view of me...hot, sexy, flirty, curvaceous, whip smart and one of the best lays in his life. 

They can both be right. 

My spouse doesn’t like my body type, doesn’t like my shape. We don’t share kinks...he wants an athletic, bisexual domme with a thing for exhibitionism. He married a shy, curvy, straight submissive. When we had sex, he closed his eyes and faced the wall and wouldn’t touch me, deep in fantasy that I was someone else. 

My boyfriend absolutely loves curvy hips and thighs and boobs, he likes playing dominant, our bodies fit together like they were made for each other.  Before him, I didn’t know that I had the capacity to be multi orgasmic. Together we are absolute magic. 

So...does that make me a shitty lover? Or a good lover? 

I submit to you that it all depends on the sexual compatibility between two people. For person A, I’m terrible in bed. For person B, I am a sex goddess in bed. 

Still the same person."

DeadBedrooms,ffb8ds2,t1_ffatls2,1579754866.0,"Hey man, we just passed the 22 year mark."
DeadBedrooms,ffb8auz,t1_ffaru3o,1579754775.0,"This. 

My husband hid the extent of his gaming from me before we got married. “I knew you wouldn’t approve.” Well, no. No shit.

So it’s only AFTER we’re married that I find out this will be a marriage where I go to bed alone every night, and he will devote 8-15 hours a day (week day vs weekend) to video games. 

It’s marrying under false pretenses."
DeadBedrooms,ffb7vde,t1_ffarzyq,1579754355.0,"My husband doesn’t like sex with me because the ROI isn’t there...takes too long (8 minutes), takes too much effort (don’t get me started), it’s more efficient to simply employ his hand and some porn. 

?!?!? Yeah I don’t get it either. What I can objectively say is that his porn stash looks NOTHING like me. It’s my belief that I don’t turn him on in a very base, root-level way. He always was able come, but it just wasn’t worth it."
