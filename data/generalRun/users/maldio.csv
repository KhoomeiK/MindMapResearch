The first time I heard about it was listening to a radio call in show, where a caller's tirade trailed into a rant about Trudeau being a dictator who was using taxes to live a lavish lifestyle while he destroyed our future.  Even the host of the show thought donut-gate was ridiculous and thought it was incredulous people were treating this like a story."

natureismetal,ff9gvly,t1_ff9evo3,1579712746.0,"The calf's mother is usually never far, so it really doesn't make a difference.  I know a guy who shot a calf, and was stomped by its mother while he was gutting it, she broke his wrist before she cleared out.  Personally, I have never shot a calf, but it's pretty common to see a cow and a calf hanging beside each other where I'm from.

canada,fez9wq8,t1_fetnu0t,1579455158.0,"I think the iPod was more revolutionary, mostly because Jobs had the financial backing to be able to get a critical mass of music available as single songs.  The iPhone was just an iPod Touch with a phone thrown in.  Even then I wouldn't say Jobs was the innovator, Napster had already revolutionized music distribution, compression algorithms and audio formats like MP3 weren't created by Apple.  Also, Bill Gates wrote software for the PC, it's a stretch to credit Microsoft with creating any technology, both companies were just very successful businesses, but neither were in the invention game.  Technical progress very often does start with academics.  The PC wouldn't have been possible without the work of academics like Alan Turing.  Video and audio compression algorithms were derived from the work of academics like David Huffman at MIT.  Not all inventors have PhD's, but it's unfair to deny the importance of academics when it comes to innovation and the advance of technology.  But I agree with your first point, many totalitarian regimes have still had brilliant technological innovators, Nazi Germany advanced rocketry, the USSR launched the first satellite, it's easy to find new technologies that were developed in those sorts of regimes."
