learnmath,fdc4om1,t3_ekkk39,1578267046.0,"I did the same exact thing that you are doing. My gap between school was longer. I didn't really like math in high school. But, I wanted that CS degree. So far I've been very successful in my maths classes (3 standard deviations above the average). I did the following on Khan Academy:  


Start at the beginning.  It may seem silly to do first graders work. But inevitably there will be something you've missed somewhere along the line.  I was able to get through to the fourth grade work in less than a day. Then I hit fractions and had to go slower. Fractions were a real weak spot for me.  An adult! Fractions are where I originally got derailed as a kid.  


It took me, maybe an extra 3 days total to start at the very beginning.  I took 6 months to learn (4-6 hours of work every day) and go through everything and ultimately finished derivatives before I took calculus in real life.  


I find that those extra 3 days of starting at the beginning have helped me immensely over the last several years of school. In Calc 2 when solving Integrals you have to do partial fractional decomposition in order to simplify an equation to a form where its easier to take the integral. My 4th grade Khan Academy experience helped me blow that section out of the water!"
