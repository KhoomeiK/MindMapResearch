getdisciplined,ffgnar7,t1_ffgn134,1579910222.0,"Bro I struggle with this too, but there is nothing what we can tell you to make your situation better. Only you have to find the willpower in yourself to make the action


Nobody is gonna help you nobody is gonna do this for you. It's fucked up and kinda sad but that's reality..."
getdisciplined,ffgmve5,t3_etgqz5,1579909927.0,What in your honest opinion is the best thing you should do to improve the situation that you are in right now?
getdisciplined,ffgjce4,t1_ffgd8ch,1579907565.0,"Well we all have tried and failed. Failed miserably often


Try again and try harder.
You can't die because even tho you might think that you have nothing to live fit there always is. So many great things are waiting for u. But nothing will happen if you won't get it. We are all all-alone in this. Nobody is going to help no-one. Nobody's gonna put in work for you or for me or anyone else...


Trust me many people were in shitty situations and pulled through. And you are not different then them.  We all feell tiredness, laziness. These are normal emotions that even successfull people feel.

All these advices are worthless. It's up to you. 
 Because u already know what you should do. Only thing standing in your way is your fear and laziness. And you can overcome them even tho it's very hard. 





Fuck family, friends everyone. Fuck those people that u live with.


Do this for yourself. I know that you are sick and tired of all this.."
getdisciplined,ffg96xd,t3_etfjst,1579901168.0,"You think you don't want but you wouldn't be writing there if you were not interested in being happy. You are just scared of change. Which is understandable. We are all scared

But fuck it let's try our best, we are all gonna be dead eventually so while we are here let's just try our best to be Happy

You know exactly what you should do but u are not doing it...

Man, you really only get this only chance on life. Please don't waist it.
I struggle with oversleeping too but that's not the way ..


Trust me you are more capable of turning your life around and by happy in any way you want. But nothing worth having comes easy so we have to try harder. 


Please man, do it for yourself!"
