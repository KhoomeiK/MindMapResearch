I’m not understanding why you’re talking about breaking the lease. If they choose to stay and get rid of the animals, why would you break the lease? If they need the animals for their emotional support and do not want to get rid of them, you can offer to left them out of the lease. To blatantly make them leave with no other cause is to refuse to rent to someone based on their disability, which is a federally protected class. 

HUD released new guidelines on assistance animals last week. You can find them here: https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PA/documents/HUDAsstAnimalNC1-28-2020.pdf"

Everything is a lot less expensive here. No, you won’t have endless summer here like you do in LA, but a tank of gas won’t cost you a week’s pay, either. Spring here is brief, summer can be sweltering with the humidity, and fall is gorgeous.

We have amazing ethnic restaurants, too. Check out Grape Leaf Diner, Sidon, New Empire, Black Forest Cafe, and Manos."

Just one other thing, though: if your state has early voting, VOTE EARLY! Don’t wait until Election Day and take the chance that the voting machines will be down in your precinct, or you’ll have stomach flu, or sunspots or something. 

It’s too important to leave until the last minute."

When Obama was in office, the Republicans voted no on everything he proposed — even when, as with healthcare, he said, “Ok, let’s do it your way.” The ACA was modeled on the program Mitt Romney used as governor of Maryland, and Republicans fought him on it every step of the way."
