Interesting. I mean, literally no one I know does and likely hasn't for 15+ years. Many people I know don't even own a DVD player now, either.

Edit: Why is this downvoted, lol? This sub can be nuts. *Most* people in 2020 are not storing or watching VHS ffs, especially not with available streaming services and downloads. Also, VHS has notoriously terrible quality."

Worth a look anyway.

Also, there's a book about Canadian radicalism in Quebec during the same time period called *The Making of the October Crisis: Canada's Long Nightmare of Terrorism at the Hands of the FLQ.*

BeautyGuruChatter,feq9qk0,t1_fep3g88,1579339219.0,"> it’s that you linked a conservative publication that defends her anti-vaccine and anti-Semitic remarks. 

Wait, where is there an actual, literal defense of her anti-vaccination stance and anti-Semitism in that article or in the Post in general? The article mentions the beef with Ami (without even naming him, much less smearing or ""victim-blaming"" him), yes, but right after it states that Kat dated JJ and highlights his own anti-Semitic bullshit.

And for anyone worried about anti-Semitism in the media, I suggest taking a hard look at allegedly reputable, ""centrist"" publications like the [New York Times](https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/new-york-times-to-drop-political-cartoons-after-anti-semitic-depiction-of-netanyahu-1.7358019) as well.

School papers, each kid has a home school folder, binder, or small paper box for storage. Clean it out quarterly, semesterly, whatever makes the most sense.

Her school papers should go in a folder or binder or a special paper box or cabinet as well. There's no reason for them to be scattered. Some of what she may need for future reference can likely be scanned and tossed.

Declutter, declutter, declutter! The packing party concept is a good idea for excess toys: You put some of the extra kids' stuff away in some boxes with their consent, and if they don't think about it or ask for it in a few months, donate it.
