AskReddit,ffu19zj,t3_ev5zdg,1580232330.0,"3 months ago.

Achilles, My bearded dragon, died from the anesthesia he received while getting a tumor removed. 

I cried a few times before that just because he was getting treatment for cancer. It just hurt so bad knowing that he didn't know what was going on, he didn't understand why he was going in these strange places to get shots and everything.

The vet told me he'd be really groggy and lazy after the surgery. But even hours later, he never woke up. The cancer didn't kill him, the surgery did. It was like I was setting up an appointment for him to die, and I didn't even know it.

The only thing that makes me feel better is that when he died, he was high as a flipping kite on morphine and other drugs. He went out like a Rockstar."

Cringetopia,ffrjywb,t1_ffr6byi,1580159573.0,"Pretending to snapchat the holocaust does not seem awesome. Awareness is fine and all, but this just comes across as incredibly shallow and disrespectful. 

If people need a phone in the context to understand and empathize with those that died, then they're really not getting message either way.

Edit: I stand corrected. Just watched it, and it's very respectfully done."
