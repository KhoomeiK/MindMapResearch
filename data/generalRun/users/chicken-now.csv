CasualPokemonTrades,ff4d1s5,t3_ep271a,1579560739.0,would you trade your shiny bewear for a timid and modest mint? Or a friend ball?

NobodyAsked,ff3pl9r,t1_ff3pbso,1579546114.0,"No one got triggered or flustered other than you, lmao. I’m pretty sure you and many others would deem it pretty disgusting if it was a woman receiving this, accept that you are a hypocrite and go on with your day"
NobodyAsked,ff3p4la,t1_ff3o51a,1579545832.0,"And there you go, insulting me and making yourself look even more idiotic than you were before. You accept that you are hypocritical but try to justify it by saying that there are worse things than this, yeah no shit Sherlock but worse things happening doesn’t make you any less of a fuckass for spewing bullshit. Not every guy is like you, while this may not bother you there are other people who may feel super uncomfortable from receiving something like this, and you trying to invalidate that just because you are a horny fuck isn’t nice. Fuck off trying to justify this girl’s disgusting behavior."
NobodyAsked,ff3kd7k,t1_ff3k1qu,1579542901.0,"Because if it was a woman receiving these types of messages everyone would acknowledge that it’s wrong and creepy as fuck, but since the person is question is a man he’s supposed to like it because of some twisted ass logic that men always want sex hence woman harassing this actor is ok. So that’s why the asshole saying that “oh but she’s a hot chick why would he be upset?!” Is getting downvoted"
PokemonPlaza,ff3jamd,t1_ff3j5pg,1579542247.0,No problem! Thanks for responding

That’s what social anxiety does, it doesn’t let you think straight, the dumb thing you said wasn’t noticed by anyone other than you, you are the only one who cares about it, people don’t pay that much attention and don’t care if you mix up mcchicken with mcmuffin, they didn’t even notice in the first place or have already forgotten about it, trust me. The only one thinking that you said something dumb is you, no one else, you are the only one judging yourself. It’s gonna be okay, I promise <3"
ShinyPokemon,fedzi7w,t1_fec6fav,1579023170.0,Ah really? Thanks for telling me

ShinyPokemon,fec2h6k,t1_fec19xx,1578965699.0,"Yup! The odds of hatching a Shiny Pokemon from the Masuda Method are increased from 1 in 4096 (0.024%) to 1 in 682 (0.15%). Combined with the shiny charm, your odds triple to about 1 in 455!"
ShinyPokemon,fec1xye,t1_fec0wtx,1578965450.0,"Heck let me explain it to you, the masuda method is a way of increasing you shiny odds by breeding Pokémon from different lenguages. You just breed Pokémon, you didn’t use any method, that’s why it took you so long. The shiny charm is a key item that you obtain the game once you complete your Pokedex, this too increases your odds of getting a shiny!"
ShinyPokemon,fec04g1,t3_eodm0g,1578964799.0,"You didn’t use the masuda method neither the shiny charm? Didn’t you? Please tell me you didn’t use them because if you did I’m fearing for my life, damn."

pokemon,fdpgi47,t1_fdpfh90,1578628017.0,"It literally can’t take you more than two weeks, man, surprise, I also have school, social life and a job. I’m not only talking about my personal experience, most of us finished the game in like 20 hours. I think I also already addressed that you can buy the online once you finish the game??? Lmao you tell me to “think deeply”, you don’t seem to able to think of even the simplest of solutions for the “problems” that you are addressing. You aren’t cooler for not buying the games, stop shaming people for enjoying things that you don’t."
pokemon,fdpf60x,t1_fdpen5u,1578627041.0,"Lmao, you beat the game... then buy the online...


Also you can totally beat the game in a month, it’s like 20-30 hours of gameplay in total, you can probably finish it in a week, you can finish it in days. You really can’t get your facts straight, neither can you reason things out. You ARE taking things out of proportion. 


I’m having a total blast playing the game, thank you. You can keep waiting."
pokemon,fdpecks,t1_fdpcxmo,1578626460.0,"I’m kind of tired of discussing with you because you can’t get your facts straight, and because you seem to not know how to manage money. I only paid for online this month, in which I completed my dex. And I’m probably doing the same with the release of the dlcs. I’m spending 8 dollars in total. Also, the dlc costs $30. You are taking way out of proportion the quantity of money that you need to spend to get all the mons. You don’t need to pay the whole year. If you don’t want to buy it then don’t buy."
pokemon,fdpcduj,t1_fdpbsvb,1578625096.0,"I’m not mad at you for not being able to afford it, I think you are actually mad at me because I can afford it. I’m not gonna advocate for gaming to be more affordable because the people who work on them need to get paid, employees in the game industry are underpaid enough. No one is asking you to buy the dlc, stop spreading misinformation in an attempt to make yourself feel better for not being able to buy it."
pokemon,fdpbkqp,t1_fdpb2jt,1578624540.0,"If you don’t have 4 dollars that’s literally no one‘s fault. If you can’t afford the game then that’s a shame, but it’s just your own problem. Not everyone can pay for their hobbies, but that doesn’t make others responsible for it."
pokemon,fdpasey,t1_fdp727m,1578624003.0,"If you have no internet the best chance to obtain the mons it’s to buy the internet which costs literally only 4 dollars. My god, you can’t manage your own money that’s no one else’s problem but yours."
pokemon,fdp6xex,t1_fdp6kga,1578621423.0,"Your main point was that they were “charging you 30 for some pokemon that should have been in the game in the first place” which is complete bullshit, they are completely free. So no, it isn’t still true lmao."
pokemon,fdp6di6,t1_fdp4nbd,1578621057.0,"You would still be shit out of luck if your friends had the dlc, you still need online for them to pass it to you. The online thing is a “problem”’outside of Pokémon really, so your argument doesn’t really hold up anymore."
pokemon,fdp4clf,t1_fdp3qkn,1578619698.0,"?????? You don’t need home to access the new 200+ Pokémon, you literally don’t need to pay anything to have them. You just need someone who has them to trade them or to trade them from previous games you already own, like it has always been since the dawn of Pokémon, my god, it’s nothing new. The switch is literally useless without Nintendo online, like any other console really, if you want to debate that it’s a completely separate issue from Pokémon."
pokemon,fdp3aqn,t1_fdp1ub6,1578618985.0,"Lmao it’s literally always been like this, in all of the past entries the mons that weren’t included in the regional dex had to be traded from other games or from other players, it’s only a problem now because you desperately need a reason to be mad at these games. Just trade the Pokémon like you have been doing for all of these past years, literally nothing has changed."
pokemon,fdoqtm4,t1_fdoj0wt,1578610830.0,"I personally think it’s worth it. The games obviously have their flaws but I still enjoyed it nonetheless. It depends on what aspects of a Pokémon game you enjoy too, everyone plays the game differently, for the way I play it, swsh was great, but again, in depends on every person and what they valorate when playing. If you really care about the graphics, then there’s a big downside to buying it, but if you care more about, for example, soundtrack, then it’s worth it. It totally changes from person to person."
