Not very useful ones.

You can post about an anecdote and then discredit it, or point out how the study missed a topic. Those are fine.

Saying ""My grandma posts selfies and she's the least narcissistic person I know, she just likes her hair"" isn't really adding anything useful by itself."

savedyouaclick,ffig5nn,t1_ffifzch,1579973082.0,Still a good contribution.
savedyouaclick,ffig4fy,t1_ffiafch,1579973058.0,"Thank you for the comment on the proportion of spending. I realize my post could come across as defense of the system - it's not. What I intend is to speak against One Single Narrative - example of ""well this social worky medicaid thing is bad so we have to get rid of it"". It does good, and, it has rough history. Social Work as a profession comes from a loooong line of colonial imperialism, eugenics, being a cog in systems which erase culture, etc. After a military conquers a people and the merchants took their valuable products, social workers would come in and convert them to Christianity and reform their education to erase local history. All because since the 1600s this line of work has assumed people need saving, and therefore are fundamentally helplessness. You see plenty of that still, on a scale as large as ""Save Africa"" to as small as ""hey why are you buying a steak with your benefits funded by my tax dollars?""

My stance is that by recognizing the full system, you can know better on what to keep, and where to change.

If you want people to deploy a better model of care, you have to pay them better. To pay them better, you have to be turning some kind of profit. Yet it is unethical to try and make profit off the poor since that's the underpinning beneath colonial capitalism anyway (much like how most poor people's lives get ruined after receiving the bill for a life-saving hospital service).

So if leftward thinking devalues a vulnerable person, and rightward thinking destitutes the same vulnerable person, where do you go? How can you proceed - by having elements of both, as we do, and leaving people both devalued and destitute? Workers along with their caseloads? Do you just ignore needy people and let them flail in vain against forces and bank accounts vastly more influential than themselves?

All I can do right now, at least in this mindset, is offer personal experience and ask questions like that."
savedyouaclick,ffi6fc5,t1_ffi5ab9,1579966327.0,"For any given dollar that you are taxed, the money that ends up in corporate bailouts or military spending is multitudes more than Medicaid, and 9/10 of my mental health clients (80% of whom were under 50) utilized either Medicare or Medicaid, or both.

The old are not the only beneficiaries of these systems.

Doubly, in the nonprofit mental health world even for Masters-level work, the agencies I was at could only spare a 0.5% yearly pay increase, and had to hold it on many different years because there wasn't the funding. With the 2% inflation rate, that meant everyone's purchasing power there slowly diminishes over time unless they had few enough expenses (such as by living at their parents' home) that they could save at a higher rate than inflation.

Most of us qualified, by income, for the same sort of benefits as our chronically mentally-ill and jobless patients. It's also not really the kind of work that you can negotiate a much higher pay rate on by changing, at least at the Bachelor level.

The pay maximum for that work around where I live is in the $16/hr mark for most case managers (starts around $13.50/hr), though you could make $300/mo more by exceeding productivity estimates or working tough shifts. Your pay comes down to which state you work in, not which employer you sign on with.

If you're a 32-year old case manager around here, you better have dual income with a family, or else buying a house is a bad choice."
