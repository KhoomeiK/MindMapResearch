So, when pondering how thoughts occur, how random things pop into my mind, or I shift topics of thought, I figured that this hairy brain lump looking thing in my skull must have a giant machine (excavator with a claw attachment?

relationship_advice,ffef3t7,t3_esxyqc,1579845622.0,"I dated a man for 3 years who had hygiene  issues. We were in our 20s, but he moved to my state from CA and I guess shit depression really, really hard. It chemically changed his smell, he had a sharp, pungent odor that I could smell across the restaurant we worked in. Before he moved there, he drove across country and smelled fine. In May. When it was HOT. He moved to my town in October and withing a couple months, he was RANK. I would try to lure him into the shower...nope. my boss asked me for advice on how to kindly send him home because of the smell. I'd wash his clothes and couldn't get the smell out. 

Ten years later, I'm hypersensitive to smell. I also have a 2 year old and no privacy, so.sometiemz I got 2 or 3 days without a shower, and it is not attractive. My husband says he doesn't notice, but i swear he is being nice.  So...i kind of think this isn't depression type stank, just regular type stank. Maybe if you tried some round about methods, like get her new panties and say you would LOVE to see a different pair every day, or occasionally try to talk her into sexy time in the shower? Or maybe have a casual conversation about personal hygiene and mention that smelling good is super sexy? Maybe if you can keep it positive rather than accusatory (even if she's guilty, no one like their ego to get hit), she would be open to adjusting things herself. If the subtle things dont works then I would try a more direct approach. 

Sorry I have chicken advice, my ex was really controlling and intimidating and as much as I want to kick his ass now, I still cant bring myself to even fathoming having that conversation >.<"

If they cant respect that, then they'd be arms length friends at best. Hopefully, they would be like ""oh crap. I'm sorry man, I didnt realize..."" and chill out. 

As far as your self esteem and dealing with all the crap leftover from her, start reminding yourself that you are better than that and deserve better than that. SHE was wrong. Something is wrong with HER perceptions or whatever, and it sucks that that came down on you, but it isn't your fault. So remind yourself that you are good, you have x, y, and z good qualities (make a list of what you like), and think up some dreams you want to work toward. Idk about you, but my biggest struggle is that I stopped dreaming and just became stagnant. So maybe that's something that would help. 

Don't let her residue keep you weighed down forever. Wash that mess away. Write it down in a journal so your mind stops mulling it over. Write down how you feel and work through all of that, while also removing it from your head. This is the best way I have ever found to stop reliving painful things.

relationship_advice,fefmsaj,t3_eop40o,1579059717.0,"I am taller than my husband, but we have definitely never had an issue to this extent..good grief. 

I'm the more self conscious of the two of us, he is definitely fearlessly confident when he NEEDS to be and I admire it so much. So, when people pick at him for being with me, he always says something along the lines of ""hell yeah, thats my tall drink of water"" or ""I'll climb her tree any day of the week"". I should note that I think it's  cute when he says that, he always sounds so proud, so it's not a big deal,and it usually shuts the other person up. Kind of a casual, jokey way of saying ""piss off and mind your business,"" I guess. 

He has also made the point to guy friends (and so have I) that it works for him because, when I wear heels, he is eye level with my boobs. So, I know, totally objectifying things, but...I find it amusing and it almost always makes people shut up. 

If they want to keep being obnoxious about it, then I stand up a little straighter and turn on the RBF,maybe mention that I've always wanted to fist fight a grown man to see how long it takes them to cry. I say ita little jokingly so  no one gets tense  or awkward, but strong enough that they kind of wonder if I would actually do it. 

So..that's my totally immature advice, but it has been effective for all of my years. At least where casual family members are concerned.

As far as his mom goes, I would try having a heart to heart with her. Explain how much you care for him, and that the opinions of others over body image are quite uninvited and unimportant. Maybe something along the lines of ""you care for your son, right? Then why on earth would you make him feel so insecure? He was so upset. And I'm sure that wasn't your intent, but of all the things to tell him to dump a person over, size has to be the worst. Shouldn't it matter more that I treat him well, care for his heart, want to see him succeed in life?"""
loseit,fecnoym,t3_eocemh,1578978502.0,"I dont have much advice, but on the diabetes topic, if you dont already have one (I assume your diabetic from the mention) get a constant glucose monitor. It makes that damn disease far more bearable. AND, tandem has just release this program that I have read works with several different brands of insulin pump and CGMs, but definitely theirs (tandem tslim x2 pump, and the dexcom g6 CGM) that's a closed loop delivery system...meaning that the pump would automatically adjust insulin delivery to keep your BG in target range without you having to manually do it. 

So...if you aren't already using this, look into it
 I've got the slim pump and dexcom g5 and the pump is pretty rad, if.cumbersome, and the dexcom is my life saver. Sorry for what may be a crappy explanation, here is a [link](https://www.tandemdiabetes.com/providers/products/control-iq)"
