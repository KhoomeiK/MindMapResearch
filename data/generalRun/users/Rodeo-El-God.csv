smallbusiness,felrk26,t3_epsxvq,1579229191.0,Speaking from an investor and broker standpoint it’s a combination of things but the 2 most important are real estate is a “hard” asset meaning it’s not going any where nothing makes it obsolete not even new construction in most cases. Where as businesses and there models can become out of date quite quickly. Secondly in real estate you have what I like to call a solid set of “rules of engagement” there’s policies and protections by the court of law that regulates relationships of your dealings with your relationships. Now businesses on the other hand rely heavily on contractual agreements which contain a lot of loop holes in most cases. Essentially real estate is one of the oldest forms of investment and sometimes currency. And as it’s stated in the name it’s actually real. Not saying businesses aren’t there is just not a lot of insurance.
