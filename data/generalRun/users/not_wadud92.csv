movies,ffuffzi,t3_ev85bk,1580240831.0,"Whenever someone criticises a franchise or a director or something. Like Michael Bay. I always defend them even though it might not be my cup of tea. Like Michael Bay makes great explosion movies. Great for the summer with a bunch of friends watching back to back explosions. And that's a good thing, because it fills a need. Michael Bay will never make a Dunkirk, or a Shawshank Redemption. But there is a place for his movies.

But Fast and the Furious on the other hand.. my god. I wish people would stop watching these not car movies so they can just stop making them. One single franchise has defeated me in being inclusive of all movie genres and styles."

PlayStation remote play absolutely distroys bandwidth. From my personal experience it's when there's two PS4s on the same network. The PS4, for lack of better terminology, hijacks your bandwidth to broadcast itself.

If you don't use remote play I would HIGHLY recommend turning it off. As much as I love my PS4, I hate how useless it is over wifi. You are already competing with others for bandwidth, last thing you need is your own device making it worse for no apparent reason.

This for me helped my 2.4ghz connected devices dramatically, the PS4 itself included.

My solution to the same issue you had was to 1, use an old rooter as an access point and wire as many devices over Ethernet. And 2, disable remote play. 

Not only do I have better connection around the house thanks to the second router acting as an access point, but also my PS4 is no longer distroying my bandwidth

Recently, I decided to go for a platinum gun, and as always, I went for pistols first. The deagle and 357 I did on the PS4 as the aim assist helps a lot to compensate for the fire rate as my first shot is more often than not on target on mid to long range moving targets. But then I did the rest on PC where my faster trigger finger on mouse compensated for the lesser damage on the other guns. And then I hopped back onto the PS4 for the long range kills.

Now I know I could just plug a keyboard and mouse or controller into both platforms, and o can just as easily switch my display from my monitor and TV. But I found the game cheap on PC, and though I usually play CoD on consoles my PC is considerably more capable. Wasn't buying a season pass so I could afford to buy the game twice, and I did.

You can't have equality. Different people have different needs. You need to adjust.

So how do we adjust to the BLM movement? Well, the first step IS NOT protesting police, the first step is figuring out how and why Stacy is not getting food. That's my issue, we know Grampa can't eat solids, we know the cat has its own diet, we know the baby has special dietary needs. Have we asked why Stacy is getting less food? 

And the harsh reality is that we know why. Stereotypes are born in some truth. And the truth is violent black crimes, particularly black on black crimes, exist in certain areas across America. And the people that ""keep law and order"" in those areas have seen it so often, they have a precondition notion of what a young black male is, which leads into racism, which leads into unjust murders. I have never seem BLM protest the fact that there is a gun store and liquor store on every street corner. I have never seem BLM protest prominent black drug dealers and crime lords. I have never seen BLM protest poverty and the intentional conditions that black communities have been put into. No. It's all about police. That is the issue with BLM, it's not about black lives. It's a ""fuck the police"" movement. Which adds more fuel to the fire.

Stacy doesn't clean her plate and screams and shouts when her plate isn't full and doesn't seem to know why it's not full.
