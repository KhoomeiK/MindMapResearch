college,fe8qgs3,t3_eo5gcl,1578929296.0,"I’m feeling the same thing, and am also a sophomore. When I drove up to campus, I immediately felt the same heaviness I felt during finals in December. I just feel like I want to go back home with my family. What is motivating me right now is that I’m almost halfway done with my degree, so I don’t want to give up."

Also, as a Hispanic student, I haven’t experienced any racism regarding the professors or the students; however, a Hispanic friend of mine did have an experience with racism, but with an older gentleman visiting campus, not from other students. The students are pretty chill."
