Like, I understand we're not necessarily talking about the third best player. It's just that when I think of the word ""option"" I associate it with the centerpiece of an offense.

For example, with the Rockets. Our third top scorer and I would also say our third best player is Clint Capela.

They work long hours because they want to work longer than their boss. They put themselves through mental strain because they stress too much about work. 

What I forgot to mention, besides suicide, is the decreasing fertility rate. Work has taken priority over family, so people are marrying later and having less children or none at all. This is leading to a terrible spiral for their society because now that less children are being born, the population as a whole is aging. Now working age people have to work even harder and longer to support the elderly and this cycles back to them caring less about starting families."

Currently, a club like Ajax struggles because it you look at their revenue last year, they were deeply reliant on that CL run for money, and relying on deep European runs every year to build a team is not a reliable source of income. Without proper competition domestically, a team like Ajax can't justify spending a ton of money. Just enough to win.

In a league with proper competition, the teams will feed off each other to create competition. Competition will create visibility and that will create money. Then the teams will be able to justify spending more money because they will need it to win the title. Money attracts players, and a positive feedback loop is created.

There is simply no way you can know this. If clubs knew this, those players would simply be worth more at that time. I would even reckon it's unlikely, considering how this season is going for them and how the assumption requires all of them to overperform.

Also, most Real Madrid fans actually don't think Jovic is doing that badly. He's underperforming for sure but only slightly. Otherwise, he's been very unlucky and he still looks very promising. Also, it's completely false that he's being asked to produce immediately. In fact, it's probably less true than at Frankfurt, where he was a key player for a team. Here, he just gets a few minutes at the end of matches to prove himself with little risk.
