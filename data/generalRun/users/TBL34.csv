RedDeadOnline,feluflb,t1_feluaaj,1579231206.0,So do I.  I don’t spend anymore time than is necessary to fill my wagon and grab some pelts.  It also helped me skin a collard peccary today.  No way would I find that in a reasonable amount of time in a populated server.

Frankly, I’m kinda surprised they haven’t nerfed it.  Just completing 4-6 challenges a day would net between 60-90 GB’s a month.  Now that I learned about remote play, it shouldn’t be difficult to keep the streak going."
RedDeadOnline,feh34pp,t1_fego17b,1579108160.0,The only challenge that never works for me is the cripps recipe one.  That thing never registers.

RedDeadOnline,fecixa0,t1_febloo6,1578975027.0,"My trader role is flourishing.  Just load up the legendary bounty “Yukon Nik” and hunt until your wagon is full then collect as many pelts as ya want for the butcher.  It’s not ideal, but it works just fine.  Having a whole server to yourself and hunting is amazing."
RedDeadOnline,fdpncc2,t1_fdplq4e,1578633595.0,Nice.  I was too cheap to spend the 7 gold on another color

RedDeadOnline,fdouqbs,t1_fdoun4n,1578613315.0,I knew poison arrows were used for wolves in the story.  I have some time to kill before my shine is done.  Maybe I’ll run over to the fence and see if there’s a pamphlet.  Lol
