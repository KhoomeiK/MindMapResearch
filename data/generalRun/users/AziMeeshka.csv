AskAnAmerican,ffrqc2n,t3_euq5n4,1580163466.0,"I have a few depending on what I am in the mood for. 

If I want a simple domestic lager I go with Budweiser. If I want a good lager I like Brooklyn Lager. Founders PC Pils is a decent Pilsner as well.

If I want an ale I will pick up a case of Sierra Nevada or a pack of Founders Centennial IPA or All Day IPA depending on if I want a session beer or something with higher ABV. I also like Coppertail Free Dive and their Belgian Tripel.

If I want a stout I will typically get Guinness Extra Stout or Murphy's. Left Hand Brewing has a good Milk Stout too that comes in a Nitro variety. I really like Nitro stouts, it really adds something to the flavor and consistency of a stout from a bottle or can. 

Those are just the standbys through. Those are beers I know I am going to like and most likely are going to be available in any supermarket or bar I happen to go to. Typically though I am more experimental. I like to browse and try new things. If I am buying beer I generally pick up something I know I like and also something new at the same time."

An employee does not actually start making a company money right away, in fact they cost the employer a good deal of money and typically don't start to make a profit for the company until they have been hired, trained, and working for a good deal of time. Depending on the job it can take a year or more before a person is actually productive enough to provide a return on the investment required to hire them. It's the same reason why people don't want to ""take a chance"" hiring someone who is homeless or has chronic drug abuse problems. They know that they will spend all this time and money hiring and training them only to have them quit or no-show a month or two into getting the job.

As for the other stuff, well that is all highly regional and depends on your friend's individual circumstances. I just don't know enough about his situation to say what the problem is.

They are legally obligated to allow you to do a number of different things when you move jobs or get fired. They must either allow you to withdraw funds (bad idea as you will incur penalties for early withdrawal), move the funds to your new employer's 401(k), keep the account managed by your old employer, or move the funds to an IRA (individual retirement account) to keep the tax-deferred status. Often the best idea is to have a 401(k) and an IRA. What you could do is any time you move jobs you roll your funds from your employer sponsored 401(k) into your IRA where it can continue making money free from capital gains taxes. Whether you choose a Roth IRA/401(k) depends on whether or not you think you will be subject to higher tax rates now or in retirement.

You are only charged or refunded the difference in cost between the two products if it is a different product you are replacing it with. You don't have to wait for them to get the product either. They ship it out right away and you have quite a while to send the old one back. Obviously if you never send it back you are charged for the replacement, but that's the price of being careless. When I got a bad hard drive recently I first troubleshooted it, called Seagate and they told me to just return it to the seller if possible. Went on the website, hit return, ended up ordering a similar hard drive from a different manufacturer as a replacement and was only charged the less than $5 difference in price.

It had hotels, restaurants, grocery stores, a jewelry store, used car dealership and many many more things. Nowadays there are a few businesses. There is a gas station, two bars, mechanic, farm supply store, etc., but it's nothing like it was at one time. Hell, a place near that town has like 20 people now but used to also have a railroad going through it, it's own school and post office over 100-150 years ago. 

Ever since cars became widespread, people could all of a sudden easily drive 20 minutes to the nearest small city and do their shopping and leisure activities.

AskMen,fekuq00,t3_epp3k5,1579207992.0,"I don't really know if it's had a direct effect on my interactions with women. I think indirectly it has, but I think that is really just a part of the effect it has had on my interactions with people in general. Abandonment issues, lack of emotional intelligence and control, taking an absurd amount of time to open up and finally become myself around new people, finding myself compulsively lying about trivial things to avoid conflict, inability to deal with confrontation or talk about my feelings, inability to even feel feelings at times. I tend to depersonalize and become emotionally numb and absent any time something upsetting happens or something that could cause a fight might happen. If I am forced to come out of that numb shell I have a tendency to get angry and storm away. I have a bad habit of letting issues fester instead of just being upfront and talking about them because conflict was something to be avoided at all costs when I was growing up. 

I'm getting better as I get older, but I'm just human and I don't expect to turn around all of this damage overnight. My anger is not what it used to be when I was younger and I am much better about recognizing that anger before it reaches a boiling point. However, the impulse to rage is still there under the surface and sadly I think that's just who I am at this point. I can control my actions but I can't really control my underlying personality that was probably formed at a very young age. I used to think I could become a different person if I tried hard enough, but this just lead to a cycle of self-hatred and disappointment. I think a more realistic goal is to have better control over my actions and more insight into my personality so I can recognize and stop myself before doing or saying something I will later regret."
AskMen,fektctv,t1_fejitqm,1579207190.0,"That all sounds well and good, but when you're in a really dark place, you are lonely, possibly suicidal, and you just want someone who will love you and show you affection, it's easy to rationalise hiding parts of yourself to keep from pushing people away. 

That kind of desperation for love and affection can cause you to do things you wouldn't normally do. If you actually believe that you are too flawed to be loved then you convince yourself that the real thing will never happen, the best you can hope for is to become someone that is deserving of love by hiding the parts of yourself that you are ashamed of. You basically spend your life living in fear that those around you will abandon you. 

Everyone says that being alone is better than a toxic relationship, and that may be true if you are a stable individual with at least a modicum of self love, but if you aren't then you very quickly start falling down a pit of self imposed isolation, loneliness, feelings of abandonment and dwindling self worth. Pretty soon you become a starving beast who will do anything to feel some kind of connection to another human being, even if it means they don't really love you they just love the person you're pretending to be."

AskAnAmerican,feh8ua3,t3_ep539v,1579111540.0,"I don't mind a somewhat broad interpretation of the Interstate Commerce Clause, at least broader than most libertarians would be comfortable with, but I also don't like how it is used as a shortcut to allow the federal government to stick it's nose into anything it wants. If you interpret it broadly enough it's hard to find anything that doesn't fall under ""interstate commerce"". I guess my whole thing is that why shouldn't the government be limited to enumerated powers? Isn't that the whole point of having a constitution? If we are going to decide that the constitution only needs to be followed at certain times or only certain parts then we might as well get rid of the thing all together because at that point it truly is worth less than the piece of paper it is written on. Either change it or follow it. Those are the only two options if we want to live in a republic with a constitutionally limited government and everything that entails. Failing to obey the constitution leads to a breakdown of institutions which in a republic is incredibly dangerous and I don't think people realise just how quickly it can lead to despotism."
