Pete_Buttigieg,ffcp7iz,t1_ffcdrrz,1579804263.0,"Call it what ever fallacy you want. But you cant argue that a vote wasted is not helpful for Trump if that vote would have gone democratic otherwise.
Ill break this down as small as I can.an
Dad asks what my 9 siblings and I want for dinner.(10) I know that at least 5 of them agree with me on pizza. The other 4 all want 3 days old raw chicken. But suddenly dad says that he's tired of pepperoni and demands that if we get pizza, it shall be Canadian bacon. I am pissed because I fucking hate all things Canada. So, out of principle to ""Stick it to my dad and his poor decisions"" I decide I wont vote at all. Now it's a 5 to 4 on Pizza vs raw chicken. Instead of 6 to 4. It's down to the wire! Suddenly the chicken kids manage to convince at least 1 more sibling that the canadian pizza is corporate made pizza bought and paid for by Emperor Palpatine! A concept you have 0 facts on but they sound convincing none the less and everyone on line says it too. So they lose one more to raw chicken. 5 to 4 raw chicken wins!

We all get raw chicken for dinner but it's ok, I had my shining moment where i stuck it to dad for being such a blind sided idiot. 

The problem is, we're all about to get food poisoning and potentially die and I can assure you dad isnt thinking twice about your radical values but instead is fighting a way to keep everyone alive long enough to try this again 8 years later.

False equivalency is a good stance when not applied to math."
Pete_Buttigieg,ffcncmv,t1_ffce70j,1579803122.0,"I guess what i mean by his conservatism lies more in his base and their almost religious contempt for outsiders. As in non-white, none religious, males. That level of fanaticism is bad for our country and there is only one other person i know in politics that pulls the same level of negative energy."
Pete_Buttigieg,ffcd9iy,t1_ffc8o4d,1579796961.0,"Not to mention the likelihood of bots and accounts created by bad faith actors of anyone who are not actual Bernie supporters but exist simply to divide us. 

I honestly think a lot of that is at play out of the seemingly obvious outcome that Trump would have a much easier time beating Bernie than any other candidate."
Pete_Buttigieg,ffccziu,t1_ffc4ba6,1579796788.0,"I agree, but I do NOT put TRUMP over country. EVER. 

There's voting for my values, then there is allowing Trump to win. Bernie, while representing the least of my values on stage, still does NOT create the kind of destruction Trump does. Bernie may never get anything passed in legislation, Bernie may keep us divided, but Bernie will not be letting kids die separated from their parents at the boarder. Bernie will not allow our soldiers to die needlessly over childish decisions/comments made via twiiter. Bernie will NOT threaten the end of the world through climate denial.

If you do not vote blue, you are by proxy promoting everything that is Trump. You will effectively put your disagreements and hatred for an individual above your country."
Pete_Buttigieg,ffccetf,t1_ffc90kj,1579796430.0,"It's not a stretch. Would you agree Barnie is the most progressive and left leaning candidate we have running?

Would you agree that Trump is the most conservative right leaning candidate we have had? (at least in our lifetime)

The comparison is not a comparison of being the same in regards to values but being the same in regards to extremes. Extremism of this nature only continues to promote more extremes from the opposite side. Most of us learn this lesson in grade school. You dont handle a bully by becoming one yourself. You outsmart the bully, you redirect that negative energy, you play in to the reality that this bully is a product of his or her situation, you get to the root of the issue and you work with the bully to fix it. Or at the very least, like most of us, you ignore them and move on.

Bernie, by all comparisons, is most like Trump than anyone else running in the sense that he represents the extreme with complete disregard for both the other side or the people in his own party. He cares not about the enemies he is creating a long the way and most divisively create later. His only goal is to win at all cost. He may in fact win this but the scorched earth mentality that got him there only further confirms the likely hood that the next guy after Bernie will be yet another extreme in the other direction.

Our government, our democracy, cant sustain this level of extremism without major consequence. If we dont pull together and unite our country like the great leaders of our past, we will continue to fall apart and will likely suffer global ramifications. 

I dont expect you to understand or agree with me as I understand that to support Bernie there is a level of energy and hatred for all opposition that can not be wavered. But I do ask that you stop for a moment and consider what comes next after Bernie? How much longer can we stay divided?"
Pete_Buttigieg,ffcb55p,t1_ffc29k5,1579795635.0,I feel confident majority Pete supporters would vote blue no matter who. The area I hear the concept of tossing their vote out of spite happens from Bernie supporters online more than any other I have witnessed.
Pete_Buttigieg,ffcar76,t1_ffc29nc,1579795388.0,"Couldnt have said it better. Sooo many things he could be attacked for yet no one does. Which is fine. But at what cost? Unfortunately, i can guarantee you Trump's team WILL NOT pass on the opportunity to trash him for all of these things. Trump doesnt fight fair and his ability to make Bernie in to a hypocrite will be all too easy. Then there's the massive fear he will generate about socialism and capitalism. It will be a freaking cake walk for Trump to make Bernie sound like the end of our nation."
Pete_Buttigieg,ffca7ou,t1_ffbyhj5,1579795051.0,I agree but I dont think anyone here is implying they wouldnt vote blue no matter who in the end.
Pete_Buttigieg,ffca1dp,t1_ffbxsya,1579794940.0,"Yes, he's essentially running the same campaign Trump did. Worse yet, he has leagues of followers that spend all of their time on social networking just trying to spread disinformation and hate towards everyone else. 

Then you have the allegations of dark money and bots. I'm not in to conspiracies but seeing how well these things worked for Trump for comparison i wouldnt be surprised if there are some truths to this."

Pete_Buttigieg,ff7yum8,t1_ff56w39,1579661633.0,"But honestly, change the channel doesn't really fit in modern sense either. Change channel on tv? Like an old tube tv with cable? I strictly stream from apps on a smart TV.

Change channel on radio? Again, more people are likely using blue tooth to stereo and streaming music.


I don't really care either way but change the channel I feel is now less relative and modern than turn the page. Books aren't quite as bound by chasing technology."

AskReddit,fepnbl1,t3_eq9k9o,1579325106.0,"I hit as many concerts I could afford and drive to as a teen.

Some of the biggest names that we're most disappointing to me from worst to least worst:

Tool - Maynard just stood behind a curtain the whole show with a spot light behind him so you could see his shadow. To this day I'm not real certain it was him. This was still earlier days of internet and before smart phones so I didn't exactly research it right away. 

Evanescence - I grew up in Arkansas just like the band. A close friend of mine went to school with Amy Lee so not only did we go to a lot of their shows in and around little rock, we went to some of the after parties. Needless to say they were an amazing band. Well one summer they managed to land a deal, released a solid album, then blew up. Yay for them. I mostly stopped following them for various reasons but another friend convinced me to go to a concert of there's when they came back some time later. The sound and performance they showed in that stadium was absolutely lifeless compared to when I had last seen them.

Linkin Park - the whole rock rap dj thing just doesn't sound good live. All I can say about that. Was really sad honestly, as I couldn't quite get in to it.

NIN: this one has been hard to admit as I grew up idolizing tent reznor and everything about him. The concert was good, almost too good. There was nothing about it that really felt special for the show. Also he stuck to most of the bigger radio hits. I get it, do what pays more, but I was really hoping for a more edgy, unpolished, un rehearsed performance. It's almost as if we were just listening to back up audio and they were just acting..


There's likely some others that I may be forgetting to mention. It's usually the bands that I had highest hopes for that tend to let you down. Lack of energy plays a huge part in that for me.

Foo Fighters for example will always be the one band I feel best connects with be spiritually. Even when they release sub par music. Every time I have seen them live starting way back to promotion of their first album, Grohl and the rest NEVER STOP bringing 110% energy and heart in their shows. That man is a fucking god and will continue to rock out like a legend until he dies I'm convinced.

Another one that blew me away even after they were past their peak was Metallica on their St. Anger tour. I always promised myself I would finally see them live regardless and damn sure I did. Even tho I had to drive one state over, lie to my parents that I was camping, and use their credit card for hotel fees. My mom almost killed me. Worth it. That show blew my fucking socks off! Also laughably, on the StAnger tour, they only played that one title song, the rest was nothing but the old hits. Sooooo much energy and so much grit. Loved it."

Pete_Buttigieg,fen2rel,t1_femcwkr,1579275684.0,"Lol and AOC is hard supporting Bernie. Good point! I'm following this discussion and agree there is no hard evidence which is likely by way of no requirement to disclose any of that info. The other person is asking you and everyone to consider which is more likely. Using money that you don't have to disclose obtained by one of your own organizations, or ignoring potential beneficial uses out right?

As in your own words, this connection here is enough for me to see how this plays out to help Bernie with or without his intentions. OR helps AOC, the kids love AOC, a year later go figure, AOC supports and backs Bernie publicly. Now you have a super star politician who got their foot hold with assistance from OR supporting the candidate behind OR. It's not evil, it's not dirty, it's not illegal. No one would care if Bernie didn't push a narrative that makes these kinds of connections seem evil and dirty.

Hope I'm making sense. We may disagree, but the connections and implications have much higher odds of favoring Bernie than not."

Tho now that I am reading in to it more for my own amusement I am finding it may not be as strict as I had assumed. Essentially, dont do anything political while on duty or in uniform it would seem. It may be fine if I were to speak on these things in my civis."
Pete_Buttigieg,fekzt91,t1_fekz98j,1579211027.0,"I live in North California. Sonoma specifically so I have at least some idea what you speak of. Every year my wife and I have packed up the dogs and kid to go visit family another state away or drive 4-5 hours away for an impromptu vacation. The fires seem to get worse here with each passing year.
It's scary and surreal and unfortunately there is only so much manpower can do to prevent it once it starts."
Pete_Buttigieg,fekyr2x,t1_feku9f2,1579210389.0,"That is amazing to get some outside perspective from somewhere our progressives like to speak in favor of time and time again.

Thank you for the insight!

Also, i hope you and yours are safe from the fires over there. We donated but I am afraid most of us are just watching from the outside in."
Pete_Buttigieg,fekydjy,t1_fekua14,1579210162.0,Sounds like you raised her well then. I am biased but AF is easily one of the best decisions one could make in life. Congrats to you and a thanks to her from a stranger.
Pete_Buttigieg,feky64n,t1_fekud72,1579210040.0,I will look in to that. Thank you!
Pete_Buttigieg,fektn7s,t1_fekpwvk,1579207360.0,Sorry I am out of the loop. What is medium?
Pete_Buttigieg,fektban,t3_epnow4,1579207165.0,"I wont mention the name/user but I literally got the below response to the the points i made.

""I also share your mistrust of our government. However, I don't put the blame on government in general. I blame the politicians that are in power, dems and repubs. The way I see it, the government has the power to do real good for the people, but when the people that have direct control of it are rich and greedy, they'll use that power to benefit themselves.

I believe that fdr and his new deal was the first glimpse of the good that our government could do. Federal spending was doubled, but it brought us out of the great depression. Ever since then though, dems and Republicans have been picking away at all the good policies. I see Pete as more of the same of that.

I should disclose that I don't support Warren, her record as a republican has made it hard for me to trust her. And I say that as someone that lives in Massachusetts. I really only trust Bernie out of all the candidates because he's been arguing for the same things that I want, all his life.

I'm sick of the centrists whose only policy is ""let's be nice and get things done"". All they ever end up doing is line their pockets as working class people struggle.""

There are so many contradictions in that statement alone I realized nothing i can say will change their mind. I just had to agree to disagree and move on."
ElizabethWarren,fekt2hp,t1_feknl6b,1579207019.0,I have no qualms voting Bernie if it comes to that. I can assure you that much. I just hope the feeling is mutual for other candidates.
Pete_Buttigieg,fekszrs,t1_feknq09,1579206977.0,"Thank you for the response. I am honestly some what dismayed that i have yet to find any corrections to my assumptions. I truly would like to think Bernie and Warren have considered issues of this sort and have an answer.

To your second point, i honestly have no idea where to start. Being active duty military, i am legally bound from campaigning for anyone  politically in anyway that brings my identity as a military member in to discussion. (to some extent, the outlines can be a bit muddy) Ya we all get by having discussions on small scale social networking but you wouldn't catch me at a candidate gathering or anything representing military in uniform or something.

And god knows these points would go over like a fart in the wind to progressives online. If some how these points could reach Pete as an anonymous veteran that would be great but ya..."
Pete_Buttigieg,fekskwu,t1_fekrodg,1579206731.0,"Thank you for the response and I am sad to hear my experience isnt exclusive. Again, I am not naive enough to assume it will be just like Tricare (military medical) but it's all i have to go on and I have not had any indication that it wont be at least to some extent, hindered in similar ways politically."
ElizabethWarren,fekladz,t1_fekkzcv,1579202407.0,"Well I cant persuade you but thank you for the civil conversation none the less. In the end my biggest concern is rather or not we all agree to vote Blue 2020.

I will be taking any of those on stage currently over Trump regardless of policy."
ElizabethWarren,fekhuzv,t1_fekcwbg,1579200365.0,"I can understand that approach. I honestly do believe M4A is a great idea and would be great for everyone. It absolutely should be the final goal for everyone. I just have doubt in how quickly we can get there and what actions we take to get there.

Also yes I do support the Green New Deal.


If I may, I would like to express to you some of my concerns with M4A from our current position. Things I have not been able to rule out and or have answered directly.


TLDR: I think there's good potential to help make the case on how we need to be very cautious, direct, and delicate about how we set up our next medical plan. Especially a GOV ran plan.

As a military member who has free healthcare, I wish we would get more info on how things will be covered under M4A plan. In short, there are many things I cant get covered be it considered cosmetic or simply unnecessary for my health. Braces or extensive fertility treatment for example. My wife and I had to seek private insurance outside the gov plan because we could not get a diagnosis. We were told we were among a low 3% of people in the nation struggling with un-diagnosed infertility. As in, current science could not find the root cause. This was 6 years of miscarriages and trying to start a family while paying out of our pocket for additional support. Military (FREE MEDICAL) would not cover us as we could not get a proper diagnoses.

There are other areas where I may have access to coverage but at government set extremes not left for discussion. If a woman want's a breast reduction due to back pain, under the current system I have, they will require that she be reduced to something like an A cup instead of having the chance to settle on a comfortable spot like B or C. Her option was to go almost flat and greatly affecting her looks or nothing at all. Source: My sister-in-law in the military as well. 

Or how it effects the time line of support. Other's from other countries with free healthcare have weighed in on this. Say for example I want to go through the gender change process. In many countries, that can be a process that is stretched out over several years due to costs mitigation and long wait times. Even tho, for many, this is every bit as much of a need for them socially and psychologically as it is physically. People who have gone through the process will often admit it would have been damaging to their mental health if they had to wait in line and go through the process over the course of 5 years or more.

Or the case of those suffering from a rare disease who need to see a specialist. Or dont feel they are getting proper support from their current care provider. Or simply that provider doesnt agree or thing they have found a diagnoses. My mother has CMT (charcot marie tooth disease). At face value it seems much like MS but its not. In short, she was subject to misdiagnoses for a few years before the degenerative nature of her disease started to cause loss of usable muscle tissue in her legs. Over time they finally diagnosed her correctly but she then had to have one leg amputated. She does much better now as an amputee but I fear how cases like this would fair under a gov ran system. Again, only for my own biases with the system I use today.

Much of that bias also stems from my lack of faith in the government's ability to prioritize my needs over saving money. As Neil Armstrong once said “As I hurtled through space, one thought kept crossing my mind - every part of this rocket was supplied by the lowest bidder.” The government is classic in it's budgeting and never ending drive to always find the lowest bidder, lowest cost, lowest everything to get the job done on the smallest dime. That has been made clear to me in my own experience in regards to healthcare many times. Now I know my situation would likely be drastically different in many ways from a M4A plan but again it's the only experience I have to go on without trying to compare to other countries that do not quite relate to our own.

Furthermore, no one is talking about the very real and very scary prospect of your medical being played with as a pawn for bills between Dems and Repubs. The ability for someone to go through the gender change process in the military has been on the chopping block off and on since Trump took over. That is very scary for anyone going through it, having done it, or worse yet had hoped to do so in time. This was a hot button topic for evangelicals that, under Obama, was covered medically in the military. Then just like that, Trump undid that change. Think of all the people who joined the military in hopes to get this very important and very needed process completed and paid for by the military only to find their POTUS has taken that away. I don’t relish the ideas of our medical needs being challenged and contested as per conservative values. Hell the abortion debacle alone could be a massive war with in our government in regards to how it fits in to M4A.

There are no safeguards to a government ran plan. Your privileges will be used as a tool to fight over rather or not we need more funding for this or that etc. You could easily find yourself greatly hindered just like GOP has done to other gov funded services like education, food stamps, and DACA etc. This country is too divided to hand that much influence and power over my medical needs to the same kind of people that are willing betray our country for a man that is essentially a Russian asset.

In short, you leave us the option, and it forces the private and government sector to compete. If government isn’t up to the task of putting the customer first and the public option is, or vice versa, there will be a clear winner in time as per supply and demand. The customer wins regardless. If it turns out that the gov plan helps most for the basic needs and no one is left without coverage while public options remain for rare, unusual, and intimate cases and they can co-exist then the customer still wins. 

I hope this wall of text makes sense and I can only hope I am misinformed or misunderstanding the plans behind M4A. I am open to any and all arguments someone may have that counters any of my points above."
ElizabethWarren,fekcgse,t1_fek4v9m,1579197157.0,"Ya. Again same values on that front. My guy Pete still offers to save all of those individuals. Only he doesnt force anyone off existing plans should they choose to keep it.

However, i think it's misguided to compare us to other countries when not considering the size/population, economy, political atmosphere etc. But I wont assume it cant be as successful here based on unknowns. I'm just hesitant to draw direct correlations of that sort."
ElizabethWarren,fek3jg6,t1_fejziz5,1579191851.0,"Because that's the game he's playing? because politics?

Why are Bernie staffers [spreading hate](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/11/bernie-quietly-goes-negative-on-warren-097594) themselves with commentary about Warren being the Elite or Pete cant get black voters or Joe has no energy and no one really likes him anyways? 
Why are there reports of groups paid with shadow money supposedly connected to him and AOC  popping up everywhere trying to [take down](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-01-10/pete-buttigieg-faces-black-lives-matter-protesters-during-watts-visit) other candidates?

Why doesnt he take the time to steer his base in a positive way instead of standing by and pretending to not be aware when his supporters raid other candidate's fundraisers, [speeches](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/henrygomez/pete-buttigieg-black-support-protest-south-bend), or even crashing supporters getting together to [promote a candidate](https://nypost.com/2019/12/05/black-lives-matter-protester-crashes-pete-buttigieg-event-in-indiana/)?

Or Bernie wanting to call out use of big money never mind the allegations of him running super pack money through [Our Revolution](https://apnews.com/345bbd1af529cfb1e41305fa3ab1e604).

The man plays fast and dirty with his base and his neglect to take ownership. When i say he had it coming i think that's undercutting it a bit. He is truly the left version of Trump and will stop at nothing to burn everyone else down around him who wish to compete.

I dont expect you to agree anymore than I expect to be able to reach a Trump supporter to corruption. The only thing you can do in the end to truly save this country is understand voting Blue 2020 no matter who is the most important thing over all of this nonsense."
Pete_Buttigieg,fek2zks,t3_end7ad,1579191516.0,"That link doesnt work. Do you have the working one still?

Edit: Nvm its working for me now. Disregard."
ElizabethWarren,fek09zo,t1_fej2nh6,1579189844.0,"To the point of ignoring the will of others? There's wanting equality, and then there's forcing our values on others as if to say ""you're too stupid to know what's good for you. let me fix that for you.""

The alternative: Lets set up this other, seemingly better, option. If it is truly better and works well both within our government and for the people, it will succeed and other methods will fall by the wayside on their own. Suddenly, we're all on the same intended path, yet we didnt have to force anyone and create unnecessary combatants who only want to help us fail. It's simple supply and demand vs a more volatile all or nothing approach.

You dont have to agree with me as I dont have to agree with you. But I can assure you we all want the same thing in the end. Only some of us have a different opinion of how best to get there successfully and with minimal push back."

A true leader would just admit that it was likely misunderstood, misheard etc and apologize for how it may have sounded. Then we all move on. He's acting like my toddler, or another crazy person we all know in office. Just standing there saying, ""NOPE, NOT ME, NEVER!""
