history,ffa875v,t3_esapdu,1579729776.0,"I dont know if they necessarily did. I know china and japan tried but the 17th and 18th century saw lots of conquest and colonies set up by the dutch, british, French,  and Portuguese.  


Then the 19th century put and end to Japan's isolation by admiral Mathew perry (not the actor). Then 2 opium wars later and a boxer rebellion  china was a failed state on the brink of collapse come the 20th century.

Edit: to address your question about what china was not into trading with the silk road, indo china, and etc they didnt have anything that the chinese necessarily wanted. I know they wanted silver which the spanish had in abundance from their new world territories in the Americas.

AskHistorians,fekqfx1,t3_epllyz,1579205478.0,"Poles were given special status to live in hati because of their actions when they were sent to put down the hatian revolt. 

Nepoleon promised the poles a newly made polish state if the poles went and crushed the slave rebellion. Once the poles got to the island they saw they had far more in common with those rebelling against white rule in hati and decided to side with the Haitians agaisnt those who would impose the former status quo. The Haitians were so taken by this they were given special status so that they were allowed to live in the first ""black republic"" despite being what we would consider ""white.""

As for the germans I've never heard they were given special dispensation for being able to live in hati so hopefully someone else can fill you in on those details. 

If you want a good narrative discussion about the hatian revolution and the actions of the poles listen to a podcast called Revolutions by Mike Duncan. I think its series 4 or 5."

Kaiserreich,fegs8rg,t1_fegjoi8,1579101339.0,"I mean maybe kublai in the sense that the yuan dynasty was officially a Chinese state first and foremost and shook off those nomadic horse archer past. Who then turned his focus to dominating all land possible to expanding and consolidating chinese land and expansion. Only to be held off by the*proto vietnamese?* (I'm not an ethnographer nor an expert on the demographics of medieval era indo China so I could be talking shyte.)

Then once they've become accustomed to civilization of the chinese state, the sons and grandsons lack the martial ethos of the fathers. More importantly they lacked the effective horses that grazed in the northern eurasian steppes that were the territory of the nomadic peoples. Then were swapped and replaced and the cycle was repeated. 

I absolutely agree in terms of no one single group or people can lay permanent exclusive  claim to a particular heritage. 

I was just remarking on the nature of the formerly warrior like people on the perrifery of the empire coming to dominate their former masters and using the masters claims and titles as a unifying/legitimizing force for them holding power in the new lands. Like aurelion in rome (some general from illyria/former Yugoslavia former strictly soldier not of the upper class italian families that most roman emperors were at the time) less than odoacer just being some random german guy trying to say yeah I'm rome now.

Edit: Odoacer was spelled differently than I thought."

Kaiserreich,fe4pbhq,t3_djxfyy,1578861599.0,"Well the ai doesnt go for encirclements and tries to fight straight up against a stronger opponent. If you send volunteers you can get two huge encirclements of half a million to a million depending on who also declares on russia. If you make a b line straight for the orda border you completely cut off the caucuses. If they declare on the don kuban union it will bait in the russians so you get more units cut off. Also if you can get volunteers into finland you can cut off the russians in karelia and then their front line just evaporates and the Soviet republic will push for you. 

It's like the spanish republicans in the base game. Fighting straight up and pushing into units will just make you lose. You have to burst through and take ports or make encirclments.

That being said sometimes the ai will just mindlessly attack into the enemy and lose all its equipment or just move out of the way and let your guys get encircled which is frustrating."
