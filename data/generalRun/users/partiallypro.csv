""ls -a"" will show you dot files.

I don't now what the issue is, but it could be as simple as your cookie domain being messed up."

Surface,fean4db,t1_feaen5n,1578950464.0,"I am curious how you answer the Duo...if you have to flip it open, that is very annoying/impractical. But then you won't be able to see who is calling without opening it. Kind of strange, interested how Microsoft (or anyone) can solve that problem without an impractical 3rd display on the rear. Windows Phone was all about ""at a glance"" and not making your phone in your way...Duo seems to take the opposite approach."
Wordpress,feajkft,t3_eo6afq,1578949595.0,"Most of the top page builders are pretty lean, the only issue is that some of them rely on jQuery for some things that can make some things render block...but that can be managed."

Surface,fdfkkx6,t1_fdfjnfq,1578363870.0,"This same thing happened around 2003-2006, AMD was a head above Intel...until it wasn't. Intel will catch up eventually. The advantage that AMD has is that they have better GPUs. Nvidia still has the best GPUs, but for mobile especially having better embedded GPUs is very important."

I saw him play against Leipzig this season and he put on a master class. I was in the Leipzig end zone, and found myself cheering for Nubel because he kept making such amazing saves over and over again.

fcbayern,fd3zmmf,t1_fd1lqxr,1578163006.0,"I don't know if you've noticed but a lot of ""rumors"" surrounding Bayern turn out to be complete bunk. A hard lesson I've learned as a fan over the years."
fcbayern,fd3yl70,t1_fd1rjf9,1578162788.0,"Yeah, but I also read a report that this particular agreement doesn't rule out a loan. I know the current media report is that Neuer is pissed....which is understandable if he has to give up games...however, the media surrounding Bayern is wrong, a lot. I still think he'll be loaned out."
StarWarsLeaks,fd0yfrj,t1_fcz7vah,1578125460.0,"I am willing to bet that the editing process was completely rushed, I think I even read an interview recently from one of the films editors saying just that."
funny,fcz51y0,t1_fcxpz6m,1578093817.0,"That is not actually true, generally. Everyone says that, but no one seems to actually look at each system. Bernie Sanders is much farther to the left than some European countries even have as an active system. Such as eliminating -all- private healthcare...which of course totally exists in virtually every single European country as supplemental care. Corporate tax rates are generally lower in Nordic countries, regulations are sometimes less strict...labor while strong actually works with the company's interest. Private schooling is extremely popular in many Nordic countries. The list goes on."
StarWarsLeaks,fcz4ean,t3_ejlxd3,1578093436.0,"My biggest problem with the film is really its editing more than its story. The entire first act feels like a completely rush job, and it only vaguely gets better. I think a better edit would make the movie substantially better."

fcbayern,fctbmyv,t3_ei19j6,1577938242.0,"Imagine not having Neuer in goal. Sure, he's probably not the best currently, but over the decade? No one is even close. That's like not taking Michael Jordan in a team of the 90s because he retired for 2 years."
