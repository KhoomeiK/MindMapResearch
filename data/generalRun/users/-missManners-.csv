misophonia,ffslmfc,t3_etrg7q,1580184782.0,"Hi everyone - I’m new here because my 15 y/o son is being evaluated for misophonia.  I posted a thread asking if certain avenues for managing it have worked for some of you. My post was removed for “talking about tr*@tment”.  Yet I see a bunch of posts here that are talking about doctor recommendations, this or that brand of noise canceling headphones or earbuds, and each of these were no different in content or spirit than the post of mine that was removed.  They all involve ways to potentially tr**t and manage misophonia. 

So can anyone clarify for me how I can ask whether X or Y was effective for other members of this sub? I’m
trying hard to not break rules, but it’s unclear to me what I did wrong I light of similar posts I see here. Thanks!"

Why do you advise absolutely not the tonkotsu?"

Women will on women. Men will on women. Women will on men. I can’t imagine guys casually or routinely commenting on another guys at all. Happy to be mistaken though."
