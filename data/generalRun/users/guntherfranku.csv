WhitePeopleTwitter,fffxq3r,t1_fffwqxu,1579894093.0,You're extremely lucky. Guess it's where I live as well... in the Caribbean. Maybe the people here are just different and the island is small. So people have a different mentality.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fffwqfe,t1_fffvecr,1579893477.0,Thanks. Good genuine friends are hard to find.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fffwmat,t1_fffv2l7,1579893406.0,"Yes I know, I just didn't want you to think I was a man attacking women. Just wanted to express how women treat other women badly (at least some women have this experience)"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fffvqd2,t1_fffs6mj,1579892845.0,"Yes, but since pre-school these are the types of girls I've met.. Yes I know people still who I went to kindergarten with. Everyone just became bigger assholes lol. Another friend kept messaging me so I could be there for her emotionally and talk to her, but she wont hang out with me in person because she gained weight.  She ONLY goes out with girls bigger than her (so she could feel good about herself). Guess I'm just cursed in the female friends department..lol"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fffuz1f,t1_fffsg8d,1579892367.0,"Thanks, I hope so"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fffs22d,t1_fffo55r,1579890561.0,"I'm a girl. All my female friends. Imagine I started eating healthy and weight training, so I'm in the best shape of my life and all my ""friends"" are bitter and I just get weird looks from them when we go out and people approach me. They also said how i'd damage myself and weight training is bad and all body builders have medical problems later on in life.. But being overweight is bad too, so I'd rather exercise than ""be safe away from the gym"" like them. They also hate on me because I don't have kids...so they say oh i look young since I'm not a mother. But there are hot fit moms out there. Just because people let themselves go doesn't mean they have to hate on people who make an effort to eat healthy and exercise. I know...I need new friends and I've stopped answering their calls. I don't know how to handle them except to ghost them."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fffrfq3,t1_fffp4rw,1579890177.0,I'm a woman LOL... it's just my experiences with female friends. Even other women I've met tell me this happens to them as well.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fffny1u,t1_fff2rjm,1579888030.0,"Besides that, this wouldn't happen in real....especially with a stranger. Women are naturally haters and won't help out another woman. If anything they would be jealous that another woman is getting attention and not them.

This is why bro's before ho's makes sense. Men look out for eachother and abide by guy code. They make time for their male friends and can hang out in peace without women.

But a woman would break plans with a female friend to hang out with a guy. Overall women are selfish and only care about themselves."

single,fff1ltp,t1_ffezwrk,1579873200.0,Plus whoever it is is bored and advertising their behind lol... So I'd guess it was a guy

aww,ff9i2tk,t1_ff8omse,1579713481.0,I would not have guessed this. I was wondering why that rabbit has a at face..lol.
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff99vzf,t3_escwem,1579708168.0,Guess people here are too young to get the Alanis reference

WhitePeopleTwitter,ff94bfi,t1_ff83x4s,1579704517.0,"Maybe it's actually recycled plastic. I cannot believe people eat Twizzlers. Guess it appeals to a certain crowd who enjoy plastic, the ones with the food fetishes on ""freaky eaters"" who like to eat sand and raw meat etc."

BTW I only had it when I was actually sick, lol.. but I loved the taste."

aww,fedfzc3,t1_fearu9y,1579010489.0,This cat actually looks concerned and is looking at you with love in their eyes!
aww,fedfm2y,t1_fed8bu7,1579010200.0,"You read my mind. So I'm reading these comments and I wonder if you raise one from a baby if it will still turn on you. Do you know the Puma called ""Messi"". The youtube channnel is called ""I am Puma"". If someone can domesticate a Puma, why not a Kangaroo? I guess you will have to have a big back yard."

aww,fea6trr,t1_fe6cdwd,1578945023.0,Yea this is torture for that poor turtle. I would have cut up that strawberry and put it in a shallow dish for the turtle to enjoy.

motivation,fdqbm8a,t1_fdpnjgg,1578662192.0,"Guess you have to realize that people are not on your level, so they will throw shade and try to bring you down. So you need to know you are above their pettiness and ignore all their negative energy."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fdnnu4j,t3_elx79r,1578589642.0,This doesn't make sense since there is a type of plastic body jewelry that a lot of people use. It's called PTFE. So that would not conduct electricity. Even my tongue piercing has a PTFE barbell in it.
