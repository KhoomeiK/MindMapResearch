politics,fezvpce,t1_feyut1a,1579462269.0,"Well I think lower out put of new housing is disingenous, there's more than enough housing. Additionally, I think nimbyism is a product of deinstitutionalization, not a cause. Overprescription of drugs is certainly a driving factor and I think anybody who argues differently is being intellectually dishonest.I don't think there's any conclusive one factor leading cause.

I will again point out though that large liberal cities have overwhelming homeless problems because they have such great support networks. So yes, liberal cities have worse homeless problems not in spite of their policies, but because of them."
politics,feyfkp7,t1_fexsjjj,1579444835.0,"The catalyst that led to our modern day homeless population was the deinstitutionalization of the early to mid 20th century https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalisation

By and large liberals tend to promote government assistance for homeless or people on the lower socioeconomic scale where conservatism advocates boot straps.

So while I can't say Reagan or Republicans specifically can be blamed for our homeless population, they sure aren't helping."
