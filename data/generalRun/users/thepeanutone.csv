getdisciplined,ffv7t3m,t1_fftmbhn,1580257735.0,"1. Social media IS NOT the whole picture.  We're all just screaming into the void, don't be fooled. 
2. A huge social circle isn't the same as a few meaningful deep connections. Cultivate the people that make you feel good, don't worry about the ones that have time for you but don't click.
3. Antidepressants can give you mental happy space to see what's going on in your life. Maybe you aren't at that place (you seem to be pretty self analytical), but that can also be a depressing rabbit hole to go down. A little Prozac can be good for the soul
4. I think everyone feels lonely at times, especially this time of year.  It's nice that you know you have friends,  even if you aren't feeling particularly connected to them right now."
AskReddit,ffui6q9,t3_ev9i8x,1580242475.0,My friend's mom told us the Berlin Wall was coming down when she picked us up from some festival at the college next to our high school.  Extra relevant to them as they had just returned from a 4 year army stint in Germany.

Everyone almost always ends up sharing something about their day, and we laugh and we commiserate and we are goofy in our own, appreciated-at-home ways and no matter what else is going on,  I feel better that we're all on the same team."
