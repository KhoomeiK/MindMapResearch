trees,ff9d7if,t1_ff9b4v4,1579710421.0,"to decarb you need heat, if you at least have a stop top thing, the alcohol method is your best bet. if you wanted to avoid the alcohol method then you're gonna have a really hard time decarbing that weed because just straight up (i assume) microwaving some weed in a glass of milk is 1) not gonna get much done, and 2) fuck up your milk and make it actually hell to drink- no donut will fix that taste TRUST me. 

Basically your hang up is the decarbing. theres loads of methods for getting the THC out of the weed but you have to decarb it one way or another and that means (decently) steady heat for a good while- microwaving would require constant stopping and starting to manage the temperature because if it gets too hot you'll destroy your THC but if its not hot enough you wont convert the THC-A.

can you afford a toaster oven? those are perfect for decarbing and is what i actually use for my edibles, even a super super cheapo walmart one will get the job done."

trees,ff99oau,t3_escdxs,1579708035.0,"first, no oven means you're gonna have a hell of a time decarbing the weed

second, yes that will work but leave it sitting for way longer than ""5-10"" minutes lol, try 30 minutes to an hour depending on the fat concentration in the milk (use whole for best results)

and third, that is going to be some violently disgusting milk because theres another thing in cannabis thats fat soluble- chlorophyll, and chlorophyll is extremely bitter. this is why commercial extraction methods use solvents that chlorophyll is less soluble or insoluble in (ie: DCM, Butane, Co2)  


The traditional [Decarboxylation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decarboxylation) method is you grind your weed up and bake on super low for like an hourish maybe 45m, this turns the THC-A (which is whats actually present in the bud) into THC (which is the fun version) otherwise you're just eating THC-A which really has no chance to decarb while in your gut and you'll just shit green (not a joke if you consume enough chlorophyll, i've seen it and its alarming)

a far more dangerous but way more fun method of making weed-consumables is to take your weed, put it in the highest proof PGA you can get (pure grain alcohol, ethanol, ethyl alcohol, available at your local liquor store)  and set it on a low heat (DONT BOIL THE ALCOHOL) for several hours, once you think its cooked long enough (its really gonna depend on how much you have) take it off the heat and strain the contents- ditch the left over plant bits as they're nothing but cellulose and left over junk at this point, your deadly PGA extraction must now cool and then slowly evaporate- this is what can take the longest.

to evaporate your green fire water you'll need to pour it into a container (or containers) with a large surface area, like a casserole dish. Point a fan towards the dish and basically just wait. you technically *can* speed this process up by doing this but on the stove with the heat on super low but remember the alcohol isnt just disappearing- its going into the surrounding atmosphere where exposure to an open flame or just a hot burner could start a really nasty **invisible** fire.

Once most of the alcohol has evaporated but you've still got some (you dont want it to be a goo yet) transfer your liquid from the dish into a small container like a jar or bottle- from here you can either concentrate it further by evaporating the rest of the alcohol off, that will give you an (unpleasantly) dabbable substance that you can also easily cook with by basically just adding it to anything you'd like. 

You can also just keep the liquid as it is and use it in cooking as well, however unless you want the hellish taste of PGA in whatever it is, you'll for sure have to cook whatever you're making so the alcohol evaporates off.
