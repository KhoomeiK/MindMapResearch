look harder. if you can't easily find it in the task manager, this has nothing to do with autohotkey. there's no daemon or process you could orphan by uninstalling, or even just deleting the home dir. it could leave behind some broken context menus if you didn't uninstall properly, but that's all there is to it, none of this runs without any active scripts.

there would have to be intentional effort put into concealing whatever you're looking for, not plausible if its functions were as simple as what you're saying"

that's what happens when you refuse to use `#warn`, which would have told you `StrPutVar()` is being called with a non existent var. then it won't write any files and/or return garbage, key functions in `Crypt_AES()` would just fail with `NTE_BAD_HASH`"

Android,fdedf6z,t1_fddph3a,1578336598.0,"it's totally normal for licensed modules to rely on original hosted production servers for distribution. the point is they're clearly identified as third party code, thus developed in a samsung environment. to what extent we still don't know, but 360 would not refer to themselves as ""powered/developed by"".

so by definition, samsung is held directly accountable for what this software does. do they have the balls to let them create such a scandal, I don't see it either, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't take your own steps to eliminate that risk.

it's empirically proven by now, that you can achieve statistically effective reduction with such bare minimum intervention, the WHO standard is *20%*. that's how low the bar is, for the number of addicts you have to reach. you are killing 2 incorrigible birds with one stone, what's not to like. there is continued resistance because they're more useful for political leverage as scapegoats than positive social platforms."
Games,fd6an0m,t1_fd4ptrj,1578188070.0,"it's not the 90s any more, you don't need to hoard games just to have access to them. this kind of thinking led to a mountain of carts going [straight to landfill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_video_game_burial), since *getting your money was so easy, there was no risk in marketing literal trash.*

every title sitting in your backlog contributes to artificially inflated demand, reduced incentive for quality, and more money towards marketing over content. unplayed games just remove incentive for devs that should be competing for your free time, why grease the wheels of commerce, when you have direct control over your perceived demand."

technology,fd2etvr,t1_fczqk8b,1578146202.0,"just what the above was talking about, people confuse motivation with aptitude all the time. and it goes both ways, you could be interested in something and fail to grasp the underlying concepts, usually due to flawed approach or poor instruction. other side of the coin is if you don't give a shit what loops do, you won't get this no matter how I try to explain it.

looping mechanics are pretty abstract to anyone that couldn't imagine why you would want to repeat the same code, much less if they know nothing about control flow. like trying to learn algebra before basic arithmetic. that's not how I was taught to do it, and I wouldn't expect anyone else to just get it."

autohotkey doesn't ever need to be installed in the first place, you just have to get the interpreter onto their machine somehow, which seems like way less work than renaming files every time. the installer just handles shell associations and utilities, none of which end users need if you can get them to run by command line, or shortcut if batch is not an option."

this is always a priority over keeping any kind of mass produced label on the shelf, since it brings people into the store. even those with no intention of picking up anything besides the cheapest loaf of sugarbread find it appealing, and it's a standard strategy world wide. what country with diverse market of processed goods doesn't also have shitty bread?"
