Natureisbrutal,ff5fto8,t1_ff59nox,1579591008.0,"I can see why you think that. It was actually my first thought when I saw it as well. I’m not saying it isn’t real as the colour of the guts/offal does darken as it gets exposed to air and starts to dry up, (obviously being covered in blood will do this too), but it normally takes a very intentional cut along the abdominal cavity to open up a deer enough for everything to fall out as much as this has. This suggests to me that the deer in the image had to have landed on the fence with enough momentum for it to actually tear it open, rather than it jumping and just getting falling/getting skewered on it.

ETA: Why the downvotes? This entire sub is NSFW? I’m sorry if I’ve offended people with my description/thoughts on the image."

NatureIsFuckingLit,fekpbkx,t1_feknbbc,1579204806.0,"That’s interesting. I know there is demand for the velvet in certain places, but I didn’t know there were deer farms which catered specifically for that. Obviously a lot of the deer in parks/farms in the UK also go for venison. In reality, I suppose some of the places in the UK must also try and make the most ‘bang for their buck’ and also market the velvet & pizzles etc. I certainly know a few individual stalkers that make a bit of pocket money that way. 

We don’t have much demand for high fence hunting here. I know of one place in Scotland that caters for a couple of Americans who like to come over and shoot trophy quality fallow bucks, but ‘hunting’ is terming it loosely, as the entire park is probably not even 100acres. It’s more people paying to assist in a cull and to take a trophy home than it is actually stalking."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fek5aln,t1_fek4xl6,1579192909.0,"Agreed that they aren’t ‘natural’.

As for the motivation for breeding them, I’m not sure about NZ, but when deer are bred like this in the UK they are more often bred for ornamental purposes in deer parks than they are for ‘canned’ hunting."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fek4qxf,t1_fek4bqv,1579192579.0,"No problem, deer are pretty fascinating animals. (To me at least!)"
NatureIsFuckingLit,fek399a,t1_fek1nbe,1579191681.0,"You’re incorrect. Deer cast their antlers every year and they grow back from scratch. The genes of the animal ensure that the antlers share roughly the same characteristics each cycle, with the exception of growth and subtle changes in them as the animal ages. Dramatic changes only tend to occur if there is damage to the velvet itself, or to the testicles/production of testosterone, as this is what governs antler growth.

Antelope, or animals with horns, rather than antlers, keep the same set their whole life."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fek30yx,t1_fek1btc,1579191539.0,"They aren’t diseased. They are selectively bred, and given feed and supplements to promote antler growth. The commenter you replied to was describing a real, but rare, phenomenon. It’s called a perruque, and it’s when a deer is unable to rid itself of velvet, which is the felt like covering of the antlers which supplies blood to them during the growth stage of each antler cycle, before it then dies/gets scraped away and the animal is back in hard antler. In perruque deer this last stage doesn’t happen, the velvet continues to accumulate until it covers the entire deers head, hosts parasite/flys, weighs it down and it makes the deer almost blind and unable to feed properly. The red deer in this article are not perruque deer."

Hunting,fe14gae,t1_fdz4c5d,1578822384.0,"You were absolutely right. While I’d never tell someone to rush straight in with knife, done correctly, it is a valid option of dispatching an animal if a second shot isn’t a safe option. 

I’m not here to crap on anybody else’s experience, but if you spend enough time around deer, a situation like that occurring is a definite possibility."
suspiciouslyspecific,fdy9qkr,t1_fdxvbt3,1578777531.0,"No, Ü"
Hunting,fduh3qh,t1_fds6rv3,1578732884.0,"With all due respect, just because you can’t think of a scenario where a shot isn’t safe, doesn’t mean they don’t exist. Occasionally you might even find yourself in a situation where an animal needs dispatching and you don’t have a firearm available, if you see a deer get hit by a car for example.

The person you replied to didn’t provide enough detail as to how you should use a knife in these circumstances, and that does make it bad advice,  as the last thing you want is for people to rush in using a knife. However, there are occasions where a safe shot isn’t available and using a knife becomes a valid option.

You are absolutely right in what you say, these animals can easily cause serious injury or death, and a knife should always be a last resort, but if you approach the situation carefully, using a knife can be done relatively safely. An awful lot depends on the specific circumstances at the time, and ALWAYS try to take a second shot if the option is available.

- NEVER rush to finish off an alert deer with a knife.

- Leave the animal alone, observe, and wait until the animal is as close to death as possible.

- Approach quietly from downwind.

- Isolate and immobilise the head, whilst also being aware of the legs and the potential for being kicked. 

- Pull the head back, and cut through the major arteries by sticking the knife into the neck, close to where it meets the jaw, and pulling the knife outwards. This cuts through everything in one movement, as opposed to trying to saw through the hair from the outside in, which can quickly dull the knife. 

Once again, it should never be the first option that comes to mind, but there are occasions when a follow up shot might be unsafe, and there are certain steps which should be followed in order to minimise the risk of injury if you do find yourself needing to dispatch an animal with a knife. 

It’s a highly unpleasant thing to have to do, but worth knowing the best way in the rare event that you find yourself in this situation."
Hunting,fdttfw6,t1_fds66xj,1578721926.0,"Another reason for opting to use a knife is if taking a follow up shot was in any way unsafe, i.e a high chance of ricochet. It should definitely be a last resort though. 

You’re absolutely right about the damage they can do, so waiting to try and let the animal come close to expiring is crucial, before then controlling the head/antlers and dispatching with the knife. Not a pleasant experience, but it’s occasionally something you need to have the ability to do. Safety is always your priority, and using a second shot is always preferable to using a knife. 

At the risk of being too graphic, for those of you interested, the technique for dispatching via a knife isn’t slicing from the outside-in, (nothing dulls a knife quicker than being used against bone or thick hair). The best method is to pull the head back and stick the knife in close to the bone underneath the jaw, and then quickly pull the knife outwards, severing the major arteries in one movement.

NEVER rush in to finish the job with a knife, if you absolutely must use one, wait for the animal to get as close to death as possible, approach quietly and from downwind, isolate and control the head - and also be aware of kicks."

At the end of the day, when we have a deer in our sights, the decision to pull the trigger is a personal one, and, provided it’s safe, ethical and legal, nobody should be vilified for the decision to either shoot or to refrain from shooting. 

Back last year I was criticised for saying I will always earmark an albino deer for the cull plan if I happen to see one on the land I manage. It’s not as cut and dry as people being ‘trigger happy’.

Sometimes I feel like cancer is viewed as something that can always be beaten if you have a strong enough will, but that’s not fair to those people who fought with everything they had and still succumbed to that vile disease.

In addition to this, somebody who goes out and humanely shoots a deer is harvesting a source of meat which is far more ethical than mass produced or battery farmed meat. If everyone were to buy up all the supplies of meat from the grocery store, you would only end up increasing demand for intensive farming practices.

I’m from the UK, and we have a well established set of principles which outlines what checks should be made prior to taking a shot. 

This includes things like: 
Ensuring the deer is in a position which allows for a humane shot and also ensures the bullet will pass into a safe backstop after passing through the animal. 
Ensuring there are no other animals overlapping the targeted deer, due to the ethical considerations.
Ensuring that the deer is observed for a moment prior to the shot to assess whether it appears to be healthy and acting normally, or has any indicators of disease etc.

It should be blatantly obvious that you are looking at a deer and that the shot is safe before you even consider pulling the trigger.
