You can never prevent people moving abroad to avoid it. Well you can but that's a bit extreme for my tastes.

dontyouknowwhoiam,fgn8k94,t1_fgn7k7k,1580939720.0,"A security company will hire bouncers. A bar will hire the security company. I guess it would be possible to unionise since every company has a core set of doormen and less experienced ones they'll pair off. So they can't just hire someone else, especially since you need a licence to do it. But bars will drop a company immediately if they can't send doormen since they legally need them I believe after a certain capacity"
dontyouknowwhoiam,fgn886o,t1_fgmy10y,1580939541.0,"Worked in a bar all through uni, probably met over a hundred doormen. They are usually sound as fuck and have good senses of humour as required when dealing with drunk 18 year old girls every weekend. People genuinely like to paint them with a bad brush because they hold power over them and they're massive. You'll never see someone get disrespected worse than a wee bouncer."
