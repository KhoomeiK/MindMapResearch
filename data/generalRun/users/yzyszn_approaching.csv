fatlogic,ffgal55,t1_ffevy9r,1579902028.0,Shitting and pissing is also disembodiment..how dare you reject waste from your body? That is your internalized shitphobia speaking if you poop regularly
fatlogic,ffg9z3i,t3_etbmyx,1579901651.0,"A friend is currently losing weight with CICO. He has never really spoken about it, never made a big deal of it. But now he is visibly thinner and not the ‘fat guy’ of one group anymore. He used to get called fat face and other stuff in a casual way by a few people in our group. Now he doesn’t look that fat anymore. There are some people in our group who look like they could soon inherit the title of ‘fattest in the group’. They are generally encouraging of my friend about his weight loss but I noticed one of those guys telling my friend things like this- “hey you are doing good but don’t get so obsessed” “it might be hard for you to hear now but girls don’t really care about men’s weight or looks that much..all they want is confidence, so it is great that you are losing weight but girls are not going to get impressed probably”

I am like, my friend didn’t even speak about his weight loss thing that much to be called obsessed nor has he ever said he is doing it to get girls..am I reading into it too much or are these other guys are being subtly jealous and discouraging?"

fatlogic,ffg774l,t1_ffg3lhh,1579899935.0,This. I am also getting called ‘obsessed’ regularly. It is making me question myself- how else am I supposed to achieve fitness? I work out for just an hour a day..it isn’t even that obsessive
fatlogic,ffermoc,t1_ffere8i,1579862137.0,"I guess what I am trying to say is, one of the points you mentioned is “ the idea of I can be big but I don’t want a big person is so baffling”. I just think this is not a baffling idea, lots of people don’t do that level of introspection and the kind of tuning of expectations based on their own qualities. They just want the absolute best (which is fine) but then that gets distorted into looking down on someone they perceive as ‘not the absolute best’ which is the thing they cry out against if it happens TO them"
fatlogic,fferb63,t1_ffer347,1579861654.0,"People will never have problems with wanting to be with someone they perceive as more attractive than themselves. If they get that chance, then all these principled stances go out the window.
But if someone they perceive to be more attractive than themselves comes out and rejects them then they will complain.
Edit: A fat person who doesn’t want to be with another fat person is a very common thing and mostly they will just go “so what?”. It is just “rules for thee not for me” kinda thing."

Kanye,fcolnnn,t1_fcohtsc,1577835351.0,"I think he is capable enough for another album like MBDTF, but he doesnâ€™t NEED to make it now. Primarily because MBDTF already exists - it was his magnum opus so to speak. So he got nothing left to prove.
Secondarily- he doesnâ€™t have the angst in him anymore to do that- and that is a good thing. He now has a family, children, he seems to have found his religious path. Basically all the pain that was bubbling up inside of him when he made 808s and then MBDTF (the Taylor Swift thing was also a fresh wound) is not there anymore or at least a lot of that pain is now assuaged to a big degree.
So now I think he is in the â€˜return to homeâ€™ part of his heroâ€™s journey and MBDTF was the â€˜slaying the dragonâ€™ part. There is no dragon left."

AskReddit,fc796od,t1_fc78xns,1577500852.0,YOU feel like you are the same person because probably your inner qualities are something you consider a lot in creating your self image (and that is healthy as hell!) but those same inner qualities were ignored by those people and now the outer qualities which may not figure in your self image for yourself are causing them to change their opinion (which just means they will go back to their old ways if you gain the weight back)
