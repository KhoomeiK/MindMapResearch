suggestmeabook,febut1a,t3_eo9upn,1578962986.0,"I took a brief dip into Warhammer 40k, and one of the series I read was about Ciaphas Cain. Cain pretty well nails what you're looking for: he's frequently an unwilling hero who does good things because he doesn't have a choice. He's a good guy by only the strictest definition of the word."

todayilearned,fdw36vf,t1_fdvmpdq,1578754605.0,"That's $280/week, $1,120/month, $13,440/year for pooping of you can every day. I think I'd live with it."
DnD,fdqdh7s,t3_emo1ee,1578663762.0,Very cool. Gonna have to make one of these.
todayilearned,fcxk8zv,t1_fcxile5,1578064977.0,"You're right on some level. I will never be able to say ""my grandmother cooked it this way."" What I will say is that it is very similar to the food I had while in those countries, the ingredients and methods of cooking are consistent with proper local stuff.

Are they identical? Maybe not, but there are several that I don't think would be out of place in their home countries."
todayilearned,fcxgarw,t1_fcxff4g,1578062177.0,"I have admittedly not visited Vietnam, but the German and Mexican places are fairly authentic. The big chain Mexican places tend to be Americanized, but the little mom-and-pop places (Mexican, especially) tend to stick very closely to the traditional stuff; you won't find a crunchy taco in most of these places.

I think that's because Mexican culture is very alive here. There are Mexican markets everywhere, and typical ingredients are easily found. That said, I'm only a 12 hour drive from the border, so I'm sure that plays a part."
todayilearned,fcxf3w7,t1_fcxef0q,1578061276.0,"You're right to be skeptical, but it really depends on the city. I live in a part of the country where there are lots of German, Vietnamese, and Mexican immigrants. If you want good German, Vietnamese, or Mexican food, you can pretty much take your pick of restaurants.

There is a very distinct lack of good Italian and French food, though."
