Exactly and that's a really crappy way to go through life in my opinion.  Just because someone made something you dont particularly like doesn't mean it didnt take time, energy, effort, materials, creativity, knowledge etc. Constructive criticism is always appropriate but tearing down someone else's work over stylistic differences is something I dont find productive."

I am intimately familiar with Chouniard and Tompkins his close friend and everything they did through their lives was conservation minded.  Just because a company grew does not make it bad. The pursuit of perfection is the enemy of great and in my opinion Patagonia exemplifies that.  It would never be possible to run a company of that size with 0 impact but i truly believe and have seen they do everything they can to REDUCE impact.  Constant reduction should be our goal, not 0 impact at all.  Try and reframe your question in the attitude that better is always better and best is what will always be on the horizon."
