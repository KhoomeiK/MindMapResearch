I think plenty of politicians are maliciously smart. Like they intentionally make misleading arguments, or employ fallacious reasoning when they're not likely to be called out on it."
unpopularopinion,febnmp5,t1_fe8io4t,1578960745.0,Idk. Reddit seems very approving of Democrats most of the time.

If people won't listen to her, she doesn't actually have any power."

Because my dad told me that shit too, but I was a fat weakling as a kid. I couldn't actually do shit to bullies."

My dad told me that shit too but I was fat weak little kid that couldn't actually do shit to bullies."
unpopularopinion,febi1gl,t1_fealbkm,1578959027.0,"Assuming the kid even gets a hit off.

It's not easy to just hit someone. Especially someone antagonizing you who probably wants you to hit them.

The bully is pretty likely to dodge or block the hit. If he is stronger than his victim, he'll then have an excuse to physically hurt the victim.

Don't tell your kid to hit someone unless your kid can actually win the fight."
personalfinance,febc9y1,t3_eo9hf8,1578957401.0,"You fucked up. You fucked up a lot. You need to recognize that and accept it, so you can fix it. Figure out what the hell you were thinking going $84k into credit card debt.

Seriously, there's something wrong here. Figure out what it is and address it. Talk to a therapist, a friend, a pastor, or whoever else you think can help you with that. That's the hard part.

Getting out of debt after that is an easy math problem.

You should be out of debt in 2 years.

You make $120k. After taxes and deductions like for healthcare, that should leave you with like $85k. I'll assume your interest is 26%.

How much do you need to live off of? Can you make $25k work? Yes, you can. You better.

Now throw $5000 at your debt every month and it's gone in 22 months.

Can you live off $20k? You can. Plenty of people do that. Congrats, your debt is gone in 20 months.

How about $15k? It's not impossible. Your debt would be gone in 18 months."

Sometimes they do good deeds for PR reasons so children and dumbshit naive adults think they're always good guys."
changemyview,feagf0w,t1_fc3wa4n,1578948431.0,">Assuming that they will keep it until it needs to be taken to the trash heap is not a very good way to do this analysis.

I disagree. It's the perfect way to do the analysis.

People who buy new cars every few years don't care about what makes financial sense anyway. Solving a financial optimization problem for them is absolutely pointless.

The person who is trying to figure out if it's more financially prudent to buy a new or used car is a minority, but they're also the only one who cares about the answer to this question."

He is definitely joking. He's mocking people who act like men being raped isn't a big deal.

Right after that he gets serious and starts talking about how awful that situation is."
changemyview,fea91pe,t1_fbyobnq,1578945802.0,"He was mocking people who act like men being raped isn't a big deal.

If someone mocks what Todd Akin said about a women's body ""shutting things down"" during the event of a rape, that's a lot different than someone actually suggesting that women don't get pregnant from rapes.

Rogan was not expressing an awful opinion. He was mocking an awful opinion. You can dislike him for other reasons, but this really wasn't a big deal."
changemyview,fea74v9,t1_fbz5zq2,1578945133.0,"Hold up. Did he actually change your mind about that? Or just point out some minor detail in your original post that was poorly worded?

You didn't actually think it was okay to expose yourself to someone like that, even if they happened to enjoy it, did you?"
