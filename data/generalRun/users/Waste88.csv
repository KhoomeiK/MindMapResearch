CasualUK,ffeuy56,t3_et9a88,1579866650.0,"I wouldn’t these days, but I remember being a teenager and finding a nearly full multi-pack of McCoys crisps in the park while I was getting stoned with my mates, and we absolutely ate those. 

Couldn’t properly enjoy them though, because the whole time I was eating them I was half expecting to bite into a needle or summat."
quityourbullshit,ffeu62h,t1_ffetj0q,1579865675.0,"Tbf to em, they might not have deliberately lied. They might be reiterating misinformation that they incorrectly learned was fact."
bicycling,ffcj84h,t3_esw7ij,1579800623.0,I actually kinda love this.
trashy,ffc6g1o,t1_ffc5yjo,1579792634.0,Where in the world does it take six months to approve an ambulance?
IncelTears,ffc65u6,t3_esudre,1579792444.0,"They should absolutely not ‘be themselves’, jfc.

They’re toxic cunts and should be working on being anything but themselves."
trashy,ffc5b10,t1_ffc3yf6,1579791868.0,"True, but it is nice to know you won’t be bankrupted by an ambulance journey."
CatsAreAssholes,ffc3ks5,t3_estt10,1579790683.0,"Well, the quantity is certainly impressive."
PeopleBeingJerks,ffbtyoa,t3_esrq86,1579782647.0,"Yeah! Stick it to the man! Having some minimum wage worker clean up all the mess you’ve made is like, so anarchic and badass."
Botchedsurgeries,ffbogfi,t3_esqhpu,1579775689.0,"They always look so stretched out and sore. I think it’s the weird shininess combined with the swelling. It just looks super uncomfortable.

I feel sorry for these folks."
Justfuckmyshitup,ffblzbz,t3_esqp66,1579771912.0,Better that it’s a haircut. At least that way it’s nothing a set of clippers can’t fix.
fatlogic,ff9dwce,t1_ff9d70h,1579710892.0,"Oh aye, me too tbh. If I didn’t bike to work and back I’d get fuck all cardio. But that’s only because I don’t enjoy it. I’m not worried about accidentally becoming a triathlete."
cringe,ff91xvs,t1_ff873wg,1579702825.0,Rejection implies he made a move. Seems more the type to secretly lust after someone from afar.
CasualUK,ff8tvns,t3_esaz7e,1579695900.0,"Personally, I think ketchup is versatile, but in every situation it can be applied it is bested by a different condiment.

Chips? Mayo. Bacon sandwich? Brown sauce. Barbecue sauce in most other situations.

I’m sure this isn’t a popular opinion, but I am somewhat of a ketchup sceptic."
fatlogic,ff8tq2s,t3_esazin,1579695741.0,"I fucking hate that ‘I don’t want to get too bulky’ shite. As if you can accidentally end up looking like Ronnie Coleman if you so much as touch a barbell.

It’s like saying ‘oh running? I don’t fancy that, might accidentally run a marathon.’"
SatanicTemple_Reddit,ff6coom,t1_ff6cc7k,1579624316.0,"Fuck knows where they plucked that from, then. Pew Forum actually seems to clock church attendance much higher, but I guess they couldn't play the victim as well with stats like that."
SatanicTemple_Reddit,ff6bqp8,t3_erwhyf,1579623715.0,"'Only 18% of Americans attend church of any kind. If the vast majority of children are not brought to church, how will they hear the gospel?'

Maybe they don't want to hear the gospel, cunts."
Whatcouldgowrong,ff5ink7,t1_ff5hxo0,1579594627.0,"Tactical toupee. She goes to yank his hair, it comes off in her hand, he makes a run for it.

Would have been ideal for this situation."
Tinder,fenilhv,t3_eq3qou,1579285476.0,I think you could probably just say something along the lines of ‘smoking is a big turn off for me’ and then just swipe left of the people you consider to be too overweight for your taste.
ElderScrolls,fener2v,t1_fenemc3,1579283113.0,Gotta be a good few years ago. He’s been rocking the new look for ages now.
United_Chads,fenddz9,t1_fenclsh,1579282286.0,"Ah fair, yeah I got a few inches on you height wise (and a few years, and waist inches I’m sure)
Try the 2500 calories and see how it works for you. If after a couple of months you don’t notice much in terms of gains, increase it further :)"
United_Chads,fen9mb9,t1_fen90n3,1579279966.0,"My advice is to work out how much you are eating to maintain, and then increase it. For me, personally, 2500 would not be enough for a bulk, even a lean one, and my lifts would definitely suffer.
Do you track your calories and macros?"
United_Chads,fen7d27,t3_epoo68,1579278580.0,"Hey bro, I totally get you. When I would stall or lose progress in the gym it would stress me out because I would feel like my work had been for nothing. But it's important to not let it demotivate you. You've achieved a certain level, and that means you'll bounce back to that level a bit easier when you return to the gym. I'm speaking from experience on that one.

Keep lifting heavy stuff, and keep eating right and sleeping well, you'll regain that lost progress and then some. You got this mate."
OSWReview,fen41e3,t1_fen2z9r,1579276493.0,"Ahh fair. I’m guessing they only counted the matches that actually happened. All the sources I checked state his record at 173-0 and 174 days.

So I’d personally say his kayfabe record is 173-0, but I can see how that would be up for debate."
OSWReview,fen1nj6,t1_femzit0,1579274972.0,"If we’re talking kayfabe, would we not include all the wins that actually never happened? In kayfabe, he was winning like twenty matches a week at one point."
Tinder,femzufk,t3_eq14er,1579273784.0,Traps for days.
OSWReview,femyqhi,t3_eq1axv,1579273025.0,"John Cena has the best win/loss ratio at PPV, but it's hard to argue with Goldberg's kayfabe 173-0 streak."
CasualUK,femydp4,t3_epzmjp,1579272783.0,I think people are just having a bit of fun mate.
United_Chads,femjq4y,t3_epod6w,1579259080.0,"I used the Stronglifts program to increase my squat 5x5 and I found it pretty effective. Went from 60kg to 120kg in a few months with a good calorie surplus.

Good luck, king!"
ElderScrolls,femjk7z,t3_epykt3,1579258845.0,"Orrrr, the default Nord was made to look like Triple H..?"
Cringetopia,fek9j9w,t1_fejznui,1579195424.0,"Mate, if you think you can get some money out of it, hustle them furries."
