piercing,ff8for2,t1_ff8fjnn,1579676445.0,No problem! I would wait until the septum isn't getting crusty anymore and isn't super tender. I had such a hard time with both that I almost regretted my choice to get a nose piercing.
piercing,ff8e7hb,t3_es792u,1579674745.0,You absolutely can but from speaking from experience..... Don't. Do. It. It's the biggest pain in the a$$ when healing. I would accidentally pull on one piercing trying to clean the other. If given the choice again I would never do it. And good luck trying to clean boogers out of one nostril.
piercing,ff5xfzn,t1_ff4uqur,1579613449.0,I have that exact one but I use it for my septum! It's from Hottopic.
piercing,fexbfna,t1_fexb2e5,1579428118.0,"Hun. This was my first after 10 years. I had it redone 4 times before it was done right so I know the pain. I took mine out myself but it would be best to have it looked at to make sure it's done without too much pain and to avoid damaging it further. That's the correct answer. HOWEVER, I'm a lazy b!tch and pulled mine out myself. Just make sure your hands are clean."
piercing,fexav24,t3_equ5vh,1579427871.0,Your piercing should be what others here call high and tight. It is indeed in an odd place and you should take it out and retry.  It's ultimately up to you.
piercing,feq13rw,t1_feo5cen,1579335886.0,Yooo rebuy it and return the full priced stuff.
piercing,fepzcur,t1_fen3r4j,1579335198.0,"I mean, if you can do that you could always wear 8mm in diameter jewelry if you really want to keep it. It's still quite too low though but whatever works for you. A girl I work with has hers too low and she can get away with it since she has a teenie nose."
piercing,fepz509,t1_femyvb2,1579335098.0,Yeah they all don't as to not show if they fucked up or not. I'm sure yours is fine. Mine is the same way and I was upset/worried for a while because my piercing looked too high for my liking. I mean it still is but I'm not redoing it to have it 1mm lower. I actually like a gap between my nose and my jewelry. After I took my retainer out for a horseshoe I was pleasantly surprised that 10mm jewelry sat in my nose fine. It seems like he put an 8mm diameter piece of jewelry in anyway. Just be sure to not make the mistake I did and try to put other pieces in. I did that and GUUUUUUURL. My nose was tender as hell and swollen for a week.
