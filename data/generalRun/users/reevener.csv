cats,ffig4lg,t1_ffict6w,1579973061.0,"Hi there, I was a former vet tech & current cat owner. Dander is a very common issue and (mostly) caused by grain. Many cats are grain intolerant, and unlike people, for cats allergies show up mostly through the skin. It could be that your kitty has a grain allergy. Try switching her to a grain-free food.

Also, I recommend a vet trip as well. There could be other more pathological things. Skin bacterial or fungal infections perhaps. Be extra safe and see a vet."

They tried the unknown thing before, getting people to stalk and potentially assassinate Ambassador Yovanovitch. That used ‘unknowns’ but unfortunately there is ALWAYS a trail, whether it’s texts, call records, or photographs. These ‘unknowns’ aren’t protected due to their anonymity, yet, they’re aware enough to know they could be silenced next. Therefore, ‘unknowns’ are more likely to keep a record of information in the case they need to turn in their boss before their boss turns on them.

See Parnas. He did an interview on the Maddow show to protect himself from William Barr/Trump.

When consulting a crown prince to do your dirty work, WHO in this world has enough consolidate power to make him cough up the evidence? There’s certainly more info linking him to this crime, BUT because he isn’t an unknown (rather immensely powerful) there is no way to get the evidence from him and no incentive for him to provide it."
