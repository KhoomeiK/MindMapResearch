ANormalDayInRussia,ffwsu6k,t1_ffwgcwt,1580310182.0,"They are, I live around black bears and go up a bit north, grizzlies. The saying is true “black fight back, brown lay down, white, say goodnight”. Black bears are more skittish, grizzlies will fight you (hence laying down, pretend to be dead and they might leave you alive), and white goodnight, because they have been known to stalk and hunt humans. Unlike other bears, polar bears are predominately predators, were grizzlies and black bears do hunt, they forage a lot as well. You are a meal to them. Had a friend with family in churchill, a canadian town with polar bears. They have curfew and you leave you car unlocked so other people can find sanctuary in them if needed. Stores have these cage like hallways outside of them so that you go outside, a bear can’t attack you right away."
AmItheAsshole,ffwl5zq,t1_ffseejd,1580304454.0,"I loved our trip to Aruba when I was 16. We went snorkelling, to animal sanctuaries, natural pools, national park, historical sites (caves and castles), and to butterfly sanctuary. We even went in a submarine. It was really fun. I mean, be grateful for what you get, but I disagree that there is nothing to do in Aruba. It’s small, yes, but there are a lot of attractions and I liked how quiet it was. We got an Airbnb outside of the city. Perfect vacation. I’ve also been to Curaco and it was Lovely there too. I imagine Bonair would be similar."

I’m disabled and queer, I do my part when I can but it is honestly hard (especially over the internet) to tell if someone is really wanting to learn, or just make fun/ridicule. It isn’t my job to educate them. There are so many resources now, online, in blogs, books, videos. The information is already there, as someone who strives to educate myself as much as I can, I use those resources first. I follow activists in communities, learn from them.
