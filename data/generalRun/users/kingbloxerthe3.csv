And star destroyers need an array to leave orbit but can be designed to have an array on it. 

Also: pointless side plot, useless speeders that can't even fire and when trying to ram into the mini-deathstar thing loses all its speed. And using a ship to leave another ship, not get detected then realize that small transport ships could get everyone off. And not telling people you have a plan."

She likes it and loves the children, but there are some problems of course(which I might be more angry about than her). 

It turns out that teachers can't really talk about problems with the school(which means they can't really say when there are stupid rules without possibly getting fired).

it turns out her school(not stating which) is really afraid of punishments. So much that she can only threaten to send them to the principle's office, or send them to the principle's office where they just get food(she does not let them know that though)... 

Again: she does like her job(and I am probably more angry at it than she is).
