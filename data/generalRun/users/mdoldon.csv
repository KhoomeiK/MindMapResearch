Apollo got away with it because the country decided 'beating the reds' was important.  A new moon landing has no such goal, it's nothing but an attempt to please a narcissistic President.  Most scientists agree it has no long term benefits.

Replicating Apollo would require a Nasa budget estimated at 10 to 20 times their current budget.  There is no interest in Congress for even considering that.  NASA's current plan has almost zero chance of actually getting to the moon that soon, ifvthey end up going at all.  My bet is the next President will reverse this silly plan and let NASA get back to their highly successful planetary science programs."

space,fes6rsq,t1_fenm40u,1579362001.0,"The point is not to incentivize private business to BUILD telescopes.  The point is that there is no ability among the science community to BUY the result.  The thread revolves around taking an already designed piece of tech and offering it to industry to build and then offer to the market.  The X prize type of system encourages innovation, but in this case arguably the innovation has already happened (not totally true, but more on that in a bit).  What i missing the funding to build build deploy and operate the equipment.  Of course private industry CAN build duplicate devices, but who PAYS for it?  

NASA itself is the primary funding agency for space based technology.  They do not consume funding stream, they PROVIDE much of the funding
Some of their money is spent internally  some goes to contractors and outside researchers.

 NASA has no budget available for a second JWST or really a second ANYTHING.  Even if the development costs are removed, the cost would still be very large (and ongoing for the life of the project), and the agency has no budget for simply repeating what has already been done, simply because there is a desire from one particular group of scientists.  Their aim is to push the science forward, and they have myriad groups of scientists seeking their help.  Each group thinking their area of study, their project, is the most important.  NASA needs to distribute their budget as widely as possible to get the most done.  

And no, private industry cant solve that issue, if NASA cant write those checks.  NASA is tasked with exploration and development, not repeating their work.   If some other organization wants to find the money to fund multiple additional telescopes, NASA will in fact supply the design documents.  But i dont believe there is  such an organization looking to run a ""rent an orbital telescope"" service without NASA paying the way."
