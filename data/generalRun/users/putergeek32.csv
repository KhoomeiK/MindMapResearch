smoking,ff40p3t,t3_erhi92,1579552997.0,your getting close!  Some more heat (275-300) and time.  Choose your favorite sauce and toss.

Wellthatsucks,ff39q60,t3_er9b3m,1579536988.0,Thoughts and prayers.  This is a very difficult time and its ok to grieve.  Our fur babies are gifts that have brought many great memories I am sure.  Remember those.
smoking,feh6qrw,t1_feh53q7,1579110308.0,Nice and simple.  Let the meat be the highlight!

As for the religious subtext, your EXACTLY right.  Your ""religious"" perspective is whatever you make it.  Your higher power can be a rock if that is what helps you.  

I wish I could shake the hand of the man or woman who sent this amends.  To me it doesn't matter if its $1 or $1000.  Its the act of admitting it to himself in Step 8 and following through in Step 9.  

Maybe we will cross paths in Step 12...."
smoking,fde6d68,t1_fddytgd,1578332165.0,I like this idea....  Much less risky.

Whatcouldgowrong,fcxdv6u,t1_fcwysqj,1578060303.0,"You seem to know a lot and spend a great deal of your mental energy hating on a country that is not even yours.  I am not sure where you are getting your information (my guess is main stream media and Reddit) but the situation you describe would be very unlikely to happen.   Do superiors take care of the underlings they like?  I would assume so since it happens in EVERY other profession.  

Now, I am not saying that it does not exist.  Sure it does, look at Chicago and Illinois as just one example.  But to throw a blanket statement over the entire police force is incorrect, unfair, and ignorant.  With a country and force the size the US has, you will always be able to find some kind of example.

I bet you were the kid in grade school who told on someone who did not wash their hands while you were picking your nose."

HumansBeingBros,fcuylcf,t1_fcuxa6u,1577991111.0,"I do agree that there certainly is an discrepancy between cost and return via salaries in the education system.  I am not sure that is totally the education systems fault though.  I believe that if an education was actually rewarded rather than expected, it might make costs seem much more reasonable.  I do also think there is some room that Universities can give though when it comes to tuition costs.  I just do not want to lessen the quality of education provided now."

HumansBeingBros,fcug1dz,t3_eikrle,1577980085.0,"I found a wallet once that had just under 2k in cash in it.  Boy did I want to keep it but I knew that it would bother me forever.  Was able to track down the owner via the store I found it in and return.  Dude wanted to give me $100 but I declined because it was about principal.  If it happened to me, or happens to me in the future, I would hope it would be found by a similar type person."
