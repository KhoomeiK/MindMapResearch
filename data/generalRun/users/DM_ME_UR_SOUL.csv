nba,feiiikz,t1_fei8vbg,1579139321.0,What's fits gotta do with how much you practice? D. Wade was one of them but he was also working his ass off. I think all we want to see is the people who started from the bottom and rise to the top stay the same as they were day one. Like how people hate on rappers for not talking about gang shit or they soft after being out of it for years.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fefrs6l,t1_fef2e99,1579063296.0,Its kind of used in sarcasm or ironically like u/AgentSurvivor said. Kinda like saying the n word. Its a derogatory term but its used in different ways for certain effect. I think its how white people used to talk about black ppl back in the day but I'm no history major.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fefriiu,t1_fee6lx2,1579063088.0,J Cole or Kendrick never said fuck cancer. Why they rocking with Cancer like that?

aww,fe6n7ay,t1_fe6mdn9,1578896735.0,Obviously not healthy but that's what Michael Jordan did
aww,fe5pskt,t1_fe4q602,1578872772.0,It really depends on the person. Some people take the no support and use that as motivation to prove something but then sometimes this loving support is helpful and you're happy but you wouldn't be like Jordan. However your mental health might be better.

nba,fdr7bcf,t1_fdpon11,1578680511.0,"How are you going to just ignore the fact that D-wade was more of a role player than a star that series? He was gettin his ass handed by Manu. Bosh was never that good on that team because they used him to shoot spot up shots and rebounding. Then the rest of the team was too old to compete. 

THAT and the fact that Spurs probably played the most perfect basketball ever with no real stars on that team."

lakers,fd7exlk,t1_fd6akhz,1578203414.0,"I was trying to say, people have very high expectations for rookies out of the gate. Not everyone is the next big thing, you can hope for it but dont expect it. The expectations for rookies/sophomores was too high. Lebron came to LA to finish his career in style and he cant afford any more years off. If Lakers don't win it all this year its gonna be a fail because we just gave up the future for a couple years of winning."

lakers,fd1chx5,t3_ejprjf,1578129813.0,"I mean as clever/smart as it is, I never liked this aspect of the game. Every ""veteran"" move is literally a player getting away with cheating. I don't think that great players / ""analysts"" should be encouraging these tactics. It's not real. If you care so much about being the best, maybe you shouldn't cheat to be the best."
lakers,fd1bp3i,t1_fd12v3a,1578129505.0,you expect bunch of rookies who have been winners in college and high school to lead a team of nobodies to playoffs right away? They were not even 20 years old when they got drafted. Is this how you expect your own kids success? They don't do well one or 2 years and suddenly you dismiss them?

edit: I only wish I had this much of a fun relationship with my parents. My parents are not like abusive but its a lot of societal pressures that we have to live up to and it was not easy for me mentally as I'm more emotional of a person."
