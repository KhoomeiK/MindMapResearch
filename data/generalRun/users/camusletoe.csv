college,ff1znel,t1_ff1zc55,1579489929.0,"Totally agree. I went to CC for my Associates/the first two years of my college education, no shame in it. Also, early college and middle college is becoming a more popular option over traditional high school - it allows high schoolers to get their AA/AS in high school. Early college students spend all four years of their HS experience in a community college environment, and middle college only the last two years. I did middle college, and probably saved ~$15,000 or more, and I always encourage my younger friends to consider it heavily if they come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds like I do."

Maybe you could ask for them to step out for a few minutes if that would go over well? And IMO if it's a good physician they'll still take it into consideration. Even if you're too young to be considered sexually active, many if not most 14-year-olds are still pretty horny a lot of the time, so I would categorize that as perhaps abnormal. Again, I'm definitely not trying to scare you, just trying to look out. I wish you luck and good health."

Advice,fdyioct,t3_eiv9dl,1578780158.0,"I'm going to be completely honest with you.

I've been browsing around on r/AITA and saw your catnapping post, then went to your profile.

I see that you want to work for the BAU of the FBI, and that you also posted about wanting to use/abuse dilaudid.

Are you just a really big fan of Criminal Minds? One of the characters, Spencer Reid, has several PhD's, is a psychologist, and has a character history of dilaudid abuse.

I get liking a piece of fiction so much that you almost want to inject yourself into it - hell, when I was 15 and reading the 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series, I wanted to swing around a longsword myself - but basing your entire career off of liking a television show is not a good move in the long run.

That being said, it is not impossible to do what you're asking.

Step 1 should be easy enough, graduating high school.

There are a number of steps between steps 1 and 2. Before getting your PhD, you will need to get a Bachelor's. I saw that you plan on majoring in psychology and criminal justice, this is good. While in undergraduate school, you're going to have to work hard to distinguish yourself from all other PhD candidates. This will mean running studies, doing internships, maintaining as close as you can get to a perfect GPA, etc.

Since it looks like you're planning on getting your PhD in Aotearoa before moving to the US, I'm not sure what that process is, but moving to the States should be relatively easy - that could change, though. If you're 15 now, you'll likely earn your PhD around the age of 31, and a lot can happen in 16 years.

I have no idea what the requirements of joining the FBI or the BAU are.

Good luck."
