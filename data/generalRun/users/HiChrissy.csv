I asked for cards on Thursday and already received some today! Later today I will take photos and thank people properly! This week I have worked very hard on my physiotherapy. I am also working on my handwriting in both Japanese and English because I want to improve it.
I was wondering, what do people write on the postcards usually please? I don’t want to be very boring or write the wrong thing! 
I hope everyone is well!"
