Children have the inability to choose, it’s horrible to see so many selfish parents risking their children’s lives when they have no ability to research or develop their own opinions at young ages.

I personally have short hair as a woman but my hair grows very fast and gets into a “bowl” shape after drying. 
I use a blow dryer, brush sides and back down, and dry top hair; down towards brows, to one side, down, and to the other side. It helps your hair take the shape or your head, and keeps the sides down. 
Always blow dry in the direction brushed, then when it gets damp, brush into how you like to style it + add product 

I recommended a haircut to give some texture, and to thin out the shape. You don’t necessarily need to go short but having it thinned out will make it much easier to style"
