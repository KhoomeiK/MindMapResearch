It says i should invite her to the beach maybe we could do something risky.
Entered her room, invited her, there's 3 to choose from i think? Chose all of them everytime i invite her but nothing's happened. Her exhibitionism is so low though."

AndroidNSFWgaming,ff2zwy3,t1_ff2zqks,1579529894.0,Is it repeatable? Like you can type it again and you can get another 1k over and over? Or is it just a one time thing??

Animesuggest,fen56wv,t1_fen4ski,1579277219.0,"Well i think he's hero cause he saved the city from that robot shits in his show, but i may be wrong since i only watch the Accelerator not the Index, Railgun and etc.

He's more of a villain so yeah, i just want an anime with a male lead like him since i don't think Accelerator will be getting a second season since it's just a sequel."
