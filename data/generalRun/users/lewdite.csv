There’s just a better ROI to be earned on luxury housing than there is on affordable units and the demand is such that you don’t have to worry about filling either. Why spend 6-8 months for a $2M profit when you can spend the same time for a $20M profit? Or even $200M? Rent control and deregulation of builders is only a bandaid. The underlying issue is squarely a supply and demand issue. The weather and economy are just too nice relative to the rest of the country and that’s not about to change anytime soon."

Unfortunately after WWII people got it in their heads that property could only increase in value. 

When a mortgage goes underwater, you lose your equity. When stocks go down... so long as you aren’t on margin, nobody forces you to lose equity. That’s why everyone who had their money tied up in the market is richer than ever and everyone who had their money tied up in their house is broke and feeling hopeless. Unless they managed to hold on to their houses... in which case they’re also probably doing well. But the dichotomy between “have” and “have not” is worse.

nevadapolitics,fg0ba0c,t1_fg081li,1580404173.0,"It’s an interesting debate and I recognize the merits on both sides of the arguments. On the one hand, this isn’t an issue with renters who pay in full on time. At the same time, poorer families are being pushed out to the margins. On the one hand, gentrification and rising prices are good for the city because they bring in higher net worth individuals who, up to a certain point, contribute more to the local economy, attract certain kinds of businesses  and help increase the value of homeowners’ properties and thus the overall wealth of homeowner residents. On the other hand, it materially damages lower income workers who may not possess the education or skills to find suitable work in the shifting economy and who now must commute further which likely reduces their quality of life. The haves do better and the have-nots do worse while we struggle to respond to a homelessness crisis in the west. 

I don’t have a solution, I’m one of the people who overwhelmingly benefits from gentrification. I don’t think building “low income housing” is anything more than a temporary solution and I don’t think builders are all that interested in investing in such projects when they can do better building luxury units. Someone on the main Nevada sub just yesterday was complaining about how they got a section 8 waiver but couldn’t find any property managers willing to accept it or charge rent within then limits of the waiver. And of course 50 years of wage stagnation means the average working stiff just can’t make enough money to improve their own lot without moving to a less economically active state where prices are lower but so are wages. This whole problem is exacerbated by the influx of people from high tax states since Trump and Co. decided to spitefully eliminate the SALT deduction. I only see this issue getting more extreme in the intermediate future."
