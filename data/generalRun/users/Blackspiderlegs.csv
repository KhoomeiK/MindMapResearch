fatlogic,ffictkw,t1_ffiamrp,1579970820.0,How does a tossed green salad have a 140 calories and a tossed green salad with balsamic vinaigrette have over 600???? How much balsamic vinaigrette do they add?? What??
fatlogic,ffhoawo,t3_etgmzb,1579945122.0,"Calorie counts are so great! They're not widespread where I live at all (actually I've never seen them) so I  was really shocked when I travelled to the U.S And saw them in most fast food restaurants. 

It was a real wake up call,I didn't think a wrap or burger could have more than 600 calories, I still honestly don't understand where they pack up to 2000 calories in those tiny meals. 

However, I will say, it happens more than once during that trip that I'd walk into a restaurant, starving from having walked all day, and walk immediately out because I saw the calorie counts on the menu. My maintenance is only about 1400-1500, I can't ""afford"" a 1000 calorie meal, especially when I know I'm going to be hungry afterwards anyway. 
It made choosing a place to eat really difficult."
Advice,ff6g5o5,t3_ertzn4,1579626479.0,"What sometimes works for me when I'm stuck at a certain weight is to raise my calories slightly (usually to maintenance of current weight) for a couple of weeks (even a week or ten days usually works) and then cut them back down to your usual cutting calories. I honestly couldn't tell you why this works but my theory is that after a while of dieting you stop being so careful with counting and you get tired of eating less than your body needs, so ""resetting"" can be helpful. Anyway, it usually works for me."
fatlogic,ff4ci7f,t3_erc58w,1579560392.0,"I know this is the exact opposite  what these activists believe, but I honestly think that this is what big companies want, they want you to eat more, consume more, spend more, and then, when you realize you're going to die you spend more money to get fit (either through fitness stuff or through medical bills etc...)"
AskReddit,fek0n5n,t3_ephk8p,1579190071.0,"The black magician trilogy - a seriously underrated book series, I'd recommended to anyone into the ""adult(ish)' fantasy genre."
fatlogic,fegzaf0,t3_ep2rum,1579105837.0,"There's a lot to unpack here, but ' there's no ignorant fat people check your prejudices""(paraphrasing)???? Well, last time I checked, believing that a whole group of people is or isn't something is pretty prejudiced...(There are NO ignorant fat people ??)"
fatlogic,feg76zm,t3_eotyif,1579080236.0,"Do these people know how much work goes into having a body like that???? 
""We're coming for your jobs"" when we get off the couch that is..."
