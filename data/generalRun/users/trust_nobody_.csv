raisedbynarcissists,fh84mh8,t1_fh7bcis,1581351922.0,"I'm in awe of the relationship my husband and I have cultivated. There have definitely been hard times with my fleas on full display but after really working on myself we have reached a form of stability. We apologize to each other for pretty much everything and don't say it unless we mean it, we give each other space to process then come around.

I look at my parents and think, ""they have no clue what it could be like"""

I've, as an independent adult, started saying, ""I don't accept your apology but I'm okay with going back to pretending everything is okay""

I don't expect many if any concessions from them at this point."
insaneparents,fh7sstp,t1_fh7fm1z,1581343744.0,"I'm 27 and still feel a bit like this. I've been in therapy (that actually helps) for almost a year and have seen a lot of positive change in myself. I still have a long way to go and don't plan on having kids in the next decade or so, but I'm more hopeful that one day I'll be stable and effective, that mental illness won't keep me from something I truly want."
insaneparents,fh7rq1u,t1_fh7g9en,1581342886.0,"My parents knew I was self harming in high school. I went to therapy but quit due to peer pressure by my team to not miss practice (I didn't tell my team where I was when I missed 30 min of practice once a week). In my mid 20's my mom told me it was my fault I didn't get help back then, that I was the one who quit.

The shame that comes with self harming as an adult is really hard to deal with at times. I've been in therapy that actually helps for almost a year now but fuck. It's okay to assume kids go through phases but not with stuff like this."

RATS,fgsodw1,t1_fgsge8g,1581089161.0,The mods cracked down on fat rat posts because it became a friendly competition at the expense of the unhealthy rat at some point last year. I still see fat rats posted but rarely see it glorified or whatever.

TrollXChromosomes,fgmuyxv,t1_fgmqkxt,1580932548.0,This! I took a moral problems  philosophy class and this is the thing I remember most. I've tried to explain it to people but I've never nail the landing and I've never met someone who had heard of it. Time to refresh.
TrollXChromosomes,fgmujfl,t1_fgms9lz,1580932329.0,"Michigan, too. Last year my area had 2 different cases where parents sued for religious beliefs. One of the kids passed days after leaving the hospital for a rehab facility and the other passed before leaving the hospital. It was heartbreaking to watch, knowing full well how it would end. 

I have many bones to pick with the medical community/laws over quality of life. Watching a family member slowly deteriorate in a hospital/rehab has left me scared."
cats,fgm0dcg,t1_fgkdz5j,1580915296.0,"My kitty was on pred for a few years, too. My vet stressed to me the side effects of the oral steroid even though I couldn't afford the inhaler, at least not in my country. It's almost $300 for a refill (one single inhaler) that lasts 6-8 months using it minimally.

So I started buying it online for reasonable prices. I was really sketched out buying something not FDA approved but I haven't found anything bad about the manufacturer over the years. 

I can send you the site I use if you'd like, I just gotta look in my email. 

Ironically, my cat had his last attack around the time I stopped the pred. My kitty might be worse off than yours, but the oral steroid isn't as effective or safe as the aerosol.

Best of luck with your kitty! I'm glad they are in good hands (:

Edit: my cat was about 2-3 when he started having attacks. I thought he was trying to cough up hairballs for the first few years till I really looked into it and was absolutely horrified. I felt so bad he had gone untreated for so long."

I don't doubt you that the psychotropic effects would diminish with a consistent dose, but I can't afford to. Part of the ""ball and chain"" is that I don't smoke indoors and where I live gets cold. I don't know how cig smokers do it. Maybe they're just as uncomfortable as me, idk.

I've tried the edibles thing but it's hard to find ones that aren't just THC distillate and they are more expensive than flower anyway.

raisedbynarcissists,ffx4zz0,t1_ffwq20q,1580317871.0,I remember when one of my friends casually mentioned gaslighting to me when I was 23. We weren't talking about my parents or anything like it so I sat there silently while my mind imploded. I had known there was something wrong for many years but that was a turning point.

Turns out they were fighting and I was able to gather is was because of me by the way she ignored me and walked out of any room I walked into the rest of the trip.

Yet, I still have a mini freak out if I can't find one right away in the morning. 

On the flip side, I've had to get into the habit of accounting for my cats at night before I close the door because one will hide and get locked in there on accident. He was playmates with ferrets at one point so he's not a concern past accidently hurning them, but it's still to be avoided."
raisedbynarcissists,ffcmvcw,t1_ffceqq0,1579802827.0,"I always wanted a relationship with my brother despite what my mom said, but once the veil was lifted and I saw my parents behavior for what it was and reached out, my brother still rejected and ignored me for a number of years because of what my parents had told him about me. It absolutely broke my heart like it had never been before. For a number of years I thought he would never come back into my life and I started to think of myself as an only child as a type of wall to the reality I didn't want to accept.

Then on day on the rare occasion my brother and I were in the same state and under the same roof (family wedding) my brother just...started talking to me. We stayed up til 2 am together talking. He told me he had worked through some of his own stuff regarding our parents behavior and came out the other side realizing his reasons for pushing me out were wrong.

I'm glad we are back in contact and building a relationship, but it hurts remembering that I went through all my HS and college years without his support and knowledge. I had a rough go of it with chronic physical and mental illness. I do forgive him because I know what it's like to be in that position. I know that our mom poisoned our relationship. It hurts because we can't get those years back. We used to live within a couple hours of each other and have slowly moved farther apart over the years, he's now a 16 hour drive away. 

Anyway, thanks for that. I forget people on this sub are in the same shoes as my brother. Knowing my future kids will have an uncle brings me so much joy. I hope you get that kind of happiness, too."
raisedbynarcissists,ffbzptd,t1_ffbpw23,1579787774.0,"I think how much they interact with their (toxic) family matters, too. If someone will protect you against the abuse in their family and not expect you to interact with them much if at all, it's a lot different than them bringing you around them because they don't have boundries set up to protect even themselves. 

Basically, if the person has boundaries and protects themselves, they are more capable of protecting you against the same thing as you enter their life.

How much you trust them to actually do it, is  still up to you."

Fibromyalgia,ff94zkx,t3_esbajt,1579704973.0,"So my rheumatologist told me I've been synptomatic since my mid teens, it took me almost a decade to be diagnosed (given, I was never looking for a diagnosis because no one believed my pain was abnormal till I was 25 and saying it feels like I'm being stabbed in the leg), but my pelvic pain started a few years ago after being diagnosed. My doctors say it may have been a cyst, because I felt a pop and then severe pain for a few hours. But they have also tested me for celiac and one doctor told me the pain was just my GI track (I had a heating pad shoved down the front of my pants and I couldn't sit without the pain crishendoing, but yeah sure, I ate something weird).

Was your pelvic pain part of the diagnosis or seperate from fibro? Given, I don't know if our pelvic pain is similar in any way but, I think it's worth asking."
