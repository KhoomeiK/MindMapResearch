And if I suddenly get diagnosed with cancer, I am not gonna go bankrupt or just die because I can't afford the treatment.

HumansBeingBros,fft5ij3,t1_fft4z7y,1580208203.0,"Finding family doctor is easy. There are tons of clinics and GPs are plenty. The waiting times come for bigger stuff like surgery etc. But again it depends on the severity of the issue. Mum had some issue with her leg and was referred to the big hospital and got an appointment with a specialist within a week. She got the treatment she needed very quick. 

I personally haven't had to deal with hospitals much but when my wife wanted to get contraception, it only took a few days to get the appointment. My sister had her kids in New Zealand and I remember going to the hospital and it was great. NZ is similar to Australia for healthcare. 

Maybe someone else can comment on wait times for other stuff as I don't have any personal experience. I had some health issues with my stomach and got blood tests, sugar tests, colonoscopy, endoscopy all done in a short amount of time. It was all free and usually got the appointment the same day or next day. 

We also get upto 10 free psychology or 10 physio per calendar year as well. I have a pretty physical job so those physio sessions come in handy for massage or some work related muscle injuries."
HumansBeingBros,fft4bw2,t1_fft224a,1580206401.0,"Look one way to look at it is I am gonna pay tax regardless. What am I getting for my tax? Melbourne roads are great. We have world's largest tram network. Great train network. There is currently a massive tunnel being built to connect east to the west. There has been a massive investment to fix our railway crossings and infrastructure. On top of that we have free healthcare, good parks, great national parks. Almost every suburb now has free to use BBQ facilities built into their little local park. 

I think the biggest difference for us is that we don't spend huge amounts on military. We spend more than we should but no way near the US does. So something gotta give. You can either have best bombs in the world and shiny planes or decent public services. The government has finite amount of money and who gets it is the big question."

It's the same thing in India, the public health care system exists but it's so shit that only poor people use it. Everyone else uses private system and its ridiculously expensive.
