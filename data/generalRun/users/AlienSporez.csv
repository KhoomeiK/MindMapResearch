Every person who requests Canadian citizenship is, in fact, requesting it from the sovereign (The Queen) and as such must declare their loyalty *to her* (same as when you take a government job or join they military). As an heir Harry doesn't, necessarily, need to be granted citizenship since he can live anywhere where she reigns and all he needs is her consent to live there. As a courtesy, however, the Queen would likely request Canada ""accommodate"" her heir, but Harry doesn't require citizenship."
