ThatsInsane,fdb7snh,t1_fdawhtx,1578254747.0,"I just read up on the pioneers of that and it is HEARTBREAKING how the Nepal government treated them. All of their birds were confiscated. One of the rescue birds, Barry the booted Eagle, who was being rehabbed after being given to them by the British Embassy was forced into the hands of the Central Zoo of Nepal. They refused to agree on Barry's species(they said he was a black kite... Idiots), confined him to a 3ftx5ft cage for Quarantine, and without notifying the original caretakers they released him. The issue with the release was HE COULD NOT FLY! The Central Zoo killed that poor animal with idiocy and neglect.

The Parahawking Project left Nepal and rebuilt in Spain. From what I can see they are doing well for themselves.
