pcgaming,fcgynav,t1_fcb12rf,1577645393.0,"Because the money was never in take twos account. And take two isn't offering anything that's worth buying the game for. If it's available for free and people still choose to buy it ,it means it's worth buying. Bring something better to the table and maybe I'll buy it too. Fuck it up and maybe I won't."

pcgaming,fcaxrv7,t1_fcagpa6,1577578716.0,"They're not losing money from piracy. That money was never going to be spent on their game in the first place BC the pirate had 0 intention to do so in the first place.

Sales not made = money you never made = money not lost, however this then becomes a market untapped BC you couldn't price them into your business model & that is a fact of life. You'll never be able to capture 100% of the market BC people who can't afford it will either pirate or just not buy.

Companies love to cry over spilled milk. 

They want to have their cake and eat it too."
