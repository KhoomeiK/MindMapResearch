linuxquestions,ffia7a2,t3_etsi9p,1579969024.0,"Man, Linux is not picky, it will work with whatever you have, I used it for years on my old spinning hard drive and it was okay!!! now I have two ssd's  ADATA cheap 120GB one and HP 250gb(S700), honestly, I feel no difference in speed(os wise, I do not transfer very large files).. maybe more expensive ones will last longer and have slightly better read/write speeds but for linux, grab whatever you have money for it will run well."
Ubuntu,ffi7lxe,t3_etptds,1579967191.0,"what I have noticed is that ubuntu 19.10 or Gnome, in particular, is quite heavy, my ubuntu 19.10 OS takes up about 7gb ram when windwos 10 on the same device uses only 5.8 - 6.3GB with the same apps open (same tabs in Firefox browser). but if you go for ubuntu Mate or something, that thing just flies, and easily beats Windows by resource usage.    
I have this old laptop with celeron N2830 + 4GB ram, Windows 10 was the os it mainly was used with, while it was working, it was terribly slow, I tried ubuntu on it, Gnome was literally unusable, super lagy. But then I put ubuntu mate on it, and that machine is still working as a secondary browsing device.  


Gnome on ubuntu 19.10 is suspicious, they claimed they fixed memory leaks and for the most part it's true, gnome uses \~250Mb ram, but on rare occasions, it jumps to 600 - 1.3GB and starts lagging badly, animations become choppy, even mouse starts to not respond.  


Ubuntu itself is insanely fast and responsive, but Gnome... maaan I still don't trust that environment."
firefox,ffc8pjf,t1_ffc8l3g,1579794094.0,NICE! thank you for answer.
firefox,ffc7a05,t3_estq9x,1579793175.0,will linux users get that someday too? I switched to linux and wondering will we be able to utilize this tech too?
Windows10,ffbdt3a,t1_ffb4l2e,1579761063.0,"you are probably right, if you provide enough resources to win 10 it will work very well, on my desktop pc it runs fast, relatively smooth, but it takes up quite a bit of hdd space and RAM, my older dual core laptop with 4GB of ram is not that happy running Windows 10. I think SSD helped quite a bit, without it the usage would have been unbearable. Windows 7 was so much better on that machine, I know, because I used it, and now it is not supported while that laptop is still perfectly functional , but struggles with windows 10, had to look for alternative."
Windows10,ffa6q5g,t1_ff9qw29,1579728954.0,and I read all over the internet how ppl claimed windows 10 is so much faster than 7...  always had hard times trying to understand those claims.. my old guy runs Linux now...

SuicideWatch,ff3sd7g,t3_erfsmj,1579547812.0,"you remind me of myself, particularly those self destructive questions...  why should I do anything? why go there... Why do this, you have to understand, that thoughts cause emotions, and the worse are the questions(thoughts) you ask the worse you will feel yourself.

"" I fucking hate the way life forces us to be selfish in order to survive and to cause suffering to others. Fuck this shit. I’ve given up on humanity. "" Dude, I literally asked the same questions and made the same conclusions. Not even joking. And those thoughts made me so miserable. I absolutely understand what you feel when you think like that, because my life was shit - still is and I thought like that.  If we had a conversation about that I am pretty sure I would agree with you completely.

But now, I have to tell you, that YOU LIVE IN YOUR HEAD TOO MUCH..  YOU OBSERVE/ANALYZE too much and that causes your suffering.  YES, if you look closely enough you will notice that life sucks, humanity sucks, and you can even prove it. Enough to spend 15 minutes on the media and you will find tons of articles that something bad has happened, that ppl did something terrible.. that is true. But I understood one thing man, **YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO LET GO** and you will be happy. It's that simple. Learn to let go the things that you CANNOT CONTROL... if you cannot change something dwelling on it will not help you, but accepting it will make you free, FREE of suffering.  This comes from Stoic Philosophy, maybe try read some of it? as I mentioned I experienced that and Stoic Philosophy that is used in CBT behavioral therapy helped me.  Now I feel so much better. Did world get better? hell no! I got better myself.  That is all you can do my dude, you won't change humanity, but you can change yourself.

Psychologists claim that Anxious or depressive personalities come from compulsive thinking, fix that! World sucks, but you can be happy[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bibXcVlISGE&t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bibXcVlISGE&t=2s)"

socialanxiety,fezxoxt,t1_fezwiuv,1579463054.0,"I did meds for 10 years..  tried CBT, and was advice to do immersion therapy, like, engaging with people little by little to get desensitized, get USED to it. But instead of getting used, my nervous system broke down and affected negatively other functions of the body. Funny thing is that meds now don't even relieve anxiety.. I can't feel the difference between being on meds and not using anything.  Luckily, not all social anxiety cases are like this, quite a few ppl manage to get out of it, some faster for others it takes longer but some do beat it! So those primary symptoms you experience, while annoying, they might not last long,  you have a real chance to beat it, but be cautious don't push yourself too hard, because body may break if it can't handle."

I get more of that on Windows and I am addicted to it! but other than that I already use plenty of open source programs, qBitTorent,  VLC, Crow Translate, Joplin, Natron, Notepad++, even if I am not on Ubuntu, I support open source wholeheartedly!!!

factorio,fcvlh3i,t1_fcvftxc,1578004647.0,"> You don't necessarily have to put the chests near your port for it to work. As long as the chest is in range of the entire network (yellow zone), construction bots in the network will automatically repair any entities in that range with those repair packs.
> 
> You'll want to create repair packs somewhere in the network range and place them in passive provider chests (red ones).
> 
> What the chests do:
> 
> Passive Provider - Red - if something is placed in it, robots in the network can take it when it's needed somewhere (you request it on your person, you build a blueprint, you have a requester chest somewhere, or repairs etc.). If nothing is needed anywhere, contents will remain in the chest.
> 
> Active Provider - Purple - actively gets rid of its contents by sending it first to any active requests, like the above list, then to Storage Chests.
> 
> Requester - Blue - Actively requests the resources that you specify from the network's Active Provider and Storage Chests, then from Passive Providers.
> 
> Storage chests - Yellow - Bots will dump anything that you deconstruct, stuff they were carrying when an order was cancelled or stuff from Active Provider chests in these, unless it's first requested elsewhere.
> 
> Buffer chests - Green - these act as both requesters and active Providers. They request the things you specify and then provide that to the network (yourself, robots or requester chests with the Buffer option ticked). Useful if you want to ferry stuff over long distances without having to wait for it from all the way at the source.

excellent guide Thank you!!!!"
windows,fbj1yj5,t1_fbj00uc,1576922543.0,"can't touch Linux? it's touching Linux, quite intimately,Microsoft creating their own kernel version for their own Linux powered Sphere os, they pay Linux foundation for a seat, for a RIGHT to influence development, they also contribute code, they offer WSL subsystem... they twist and shift Linux to make their business grow... now it can be  useful to linux, but microsoft eventually will earn way more than they get back.

I have read quite a few articles how Linux kernel will include controversial code that community wasn't happy about but no one listened the community. Like those DRM kernel modules or that FAT support from microsoft, many ppl said they didn't want that, but wealthy corporations had more say in it than those common contributors. Or am I wrong? 

on the other hand Kernel can be forked and used without those modules so in that sense it cannot be touched probably, but regular consumer like me would never do that, I simply lack knowledge. 

Underdeveloped in a sense that some bugs are going for YEARS unfixed, or some tools/libraries becoming abandoned or are maintained by only one developer, who has no time to fix bugs or takes YEARS to introduce new features, what I have read about in dev.to developers complaining that they lack help and that only the biggest projects get funding/enough attention from developers. FUSE case backs my claim how one developer was struggling to remain afloat EVEN the project was immensely popular so he simply made library closed source. Well in this case I talk about Linux ecosystem as a whole, not just the kernel, because if I use Linux distro I need way more tools than just the kernel itself. 

Hobbyists like Linux! of course! because it is open source and they can modify it to their liking! it suits perfectly those needs. Even KaiOS used Linux to build open, sadly only kernel is open source everything else was closed. 

Now this is how I see it, don't need to judge me for that, if you think I misunderstand feel free to correct me I would like to see it from other perspective."
