Capital is totalitarian, all-encompassing, so everyone is expecting a totalitarian plan, down to the last detail of “who will plow the streets?”

But free time, controlled by the individuals themselves, cannot be guided or contained by a state or any other body.  

Thatcher once said “There Is No Alternative” and she was correct, in that there actually is no alternative system.  An association of free peoples, with hundreds of years of improved technology, communications, accumulated knowledge and methodologies, is the potential within capitalism.

I agree, it’s a difficult argument to make.  Also, what smooth transition?  Capitalism is a violent production method in of itself.  So I expect no smoother transition than has already occurred in the form of the 4th industrial revolution in microelectronics, the rise of service industry and precarious labor, and the destruction of our ecology.

Everything else, I can’t comment on.  

But Marx was aware that, contrary to labor going away all of sudden, technology would only intensify the labor employed, refined down to monotonous micromanaging, and extensive reliance on machines.  We’d become appendages to them.  (The microelectronics revolution evinces that point all too well by now, and development in things like RPA , AI, IA, and ML should convince some and naysayers who claim jobs and value can be created ad infinitum).  Unlike Victorians, and unlike Ned Ludd, he didn’t see technology as an impediment, nor capital as an impediment, but as historically necessary to traverse the wage system entirely."

They own enormous buildings in major cities, all tax free.  But all their practices are protected by 1A.

Unless the proposal is honest in its aims — to abolish wage labor — you can’t sell it.  It is too much abyss, too much unknown, for the average person to fathom.  It is far easier to make a political donation with the known parties and their visions than an idea which doesn’t at first glance seem to have universal application, or a plan to bridge the gap between 40 to 24 hours, 24 to 16, 16 to 8, etc.

In theory, knowledge should not contain one atom of exchange value.  And where exchange value breaks down is perhaps the markets (housing, healthcare, education, food...fucking everything) where prices begin to spiral out of control (inflation).
