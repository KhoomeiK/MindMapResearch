Issue is that laser sensors are affected a ton by the surface theyre hitting, as well as dust in the air. You can try to filter out the second (without filtering out someone breaking the laser) but the first can't really be addressed in a room like this."

The climate-change activist side makes themselves look ill-informed and generally silly when they create this strawman that denies the actual change in temperature. 

Sure you can find a couple morons who would deny that the temperature is changing whatsoever, but the majority of sane people who oppose climate change legislation and activism think that the numbers are being blamed on humans so that ""new"" energy and foreign interests can supplant the current American energy companies.

If you sound like you dont even know your opposition, then how can you be trusted to know anything about the subject at all?

Well at least I hear theyre useful for crack. But I've smoked crack a few times and the crack ""afficionado"" of the group would usually have one of those crappy knockoff adjustable lighters. Theyd take the silver guard off and adjust the flame to be like 4 inches long. That way the flame runs through all of the brillo in the pipe"
