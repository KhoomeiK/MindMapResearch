Documentaries,ff1hynl,t1_ff1gf7p,1579479514.0,"Yeah but criminalising prostitution won’t help. Regardless of the law, there are always going to be women who are desperate, men who know how to manipulate them, and men who want to buy sex. There’s still prostitution in countries where it’s illegal. 

However, if it is illegal and a woman is abused by her pimp, or is attacked by a client then who do they go to for help? They think they can’t go to the police because they’ll have to admit that they’ve broken the law themselves. It makes them even more vulnerable to being abused, hurt, and killed. 

So regardless of the fact that it highlights that it’s not healthy for them, I don’t think it’s necessarily saying that criminalisation of prostitution is therefore the correct route through which to fix this. Particularly not when you’ve seen Louis’ previous documentaries on the subject"

I spent £4500 when my puppy looked like she had a seizure and started having her head permanently tilt sideways. Turns out it was a waste of money (no tumour, a condition with no particular treatment that resolves itself within a few weeks/a month or two) and I’d still spend it again regardless, just to make sure she was ok.
