Rotterdam,ff5n4up,t3_eri1cg,1579601239.0,What area do you live and what are your hobbies/whatever? Maybe I know some things that might be of interest!
BPD,ff5n13c,t1_ff5mjqc,1579601081.0,"I think I'm going to do some research on this Daniel Fox. I've been on the waiting list for BPD for over 6 months now, so no official diagnosis, but I recognize myself for 90% in the stuff being posted here. Until I finally can get some professional help I'm reading a lot of books and articles on the subject, so Daniel Fox seems like a good addition. Thank you!

And edit: I just now see that my original comment can be understood in a few different ways, excuse me :p I woke up 5 minutes ok alright :p"
AskVet,ff5mkdo,t1_ff5eb3r,1579600364.0,Thank you for caring for these babies and OMG YES that fish one is the best.
BPD,ff5megb,t1_ff5lxby,1579600109.0,Do you know if it's possible to have different attachment styles with different persons?
BPD,ff5mddy,t1_ff5lu0a,1579600064.0,"I think (but not sure) they're trying to minimize the value of a FP as related/important to BPD, but not the existence of a FP. IMO it's totally fine, maybe even normal, to have a FP. Does it mean you have BPD when you don't? No not at all."
BPD,ff5mae4,t3_erqh4l,1579599938.0,"I used to have FP's, but I was never theirs. I also see it unrelated to BPD, even though when I first read about it it felt so ""oh that's so me, oh see I have BPD"". A FP just something that I long for because I need the validation of being loved and being important in someone's life. I've recently found mine, and I'm his. So, if it's something you think you truly need, be patient."

holdmycatnip,femwyb6,t1_felr4cs,1579271773.0,"It's not really that cats aren't thirsty, it's that they get their water from their food so drinking doesn't come naturally to them. A lot of house cats develop kidney failure over time, wet food is important and I highly recommend getting a water fountain because (in nature) still standing water can be infected so water in a bowl isn't usually attractive to a cat."

TwoXChromosomes,fddj3uj,t1_fddighz,1578314317.0,"This. We were at a point where we were discreetly telling new employees to run while they still could, or if they wanted to tough it out, to keep their head down and just nod. Everyone was scared of her so no one spoke up. Fuck that shit."
TwoXChromosomes,fddhgfz,t3_ekt2v2,1578312443.0,"I'd absolutely report her. I reported a previous manager that was an absolute nightmare (different reasons than your coworker) when no one else wanted to report her, for the same reasons they're giving you. ""it would be a nightmare, nothing will change, she will make your life hell when she finds out"".

Well, I did report her, she did find out and she did make my life a living hell. But in the end she had to leave and we got a new, great manager. I took one for the team, the team was grateful and we were all better off for it."
AskReddit,fddh8oi,t1_fddfcua,1578312176.0,"Pets absolutely can save your life. I wouldn't be here if I didn't have my cats. On the one hand they need me to take care of them so I couldn't abandon them, on the other hand I need them to remind me of why I want to keep living."

They get a little more visible in summer when I get a tan, but no one ever mentions them and most of the time I forget they are there. I'm not ashamed of them, they're part of my history and my road to better mental health."
AskReddit,fddh0wy,t3_eksqog,1578311907.0,"The female orgasm. In porn women always seem to come, multiple times, squirting all over the place. It made me really insecure at first because I'm not able to come from just penetration, let alone squirt.

Got a new boyfriend recently and have been squirting since then, so I guess everything turned out alright :p"
TooAfraidToAsk,fddglcm,t3_eksh0n,1578311367.0,"Just checking in on a regular basis can do wonders. People who are depressed often feel lonely and/or they don't want to burden others with their problems, so if you reach out and actually ask them how they're doing it can mean the world.

Also, it doesn't always have to be about their depression. Sometimes just hanging out, seeing a movie together or cooking together is enough to take a depressed person's mind of things and can really make a change."
sociology,fddggqm,t3_eksaze,1578311208.0,Maybe ask the mods of those respective subreddits if it would be OK for you to contact people that posted on those subs?
TwoXChromosomes,fcwwf0x,t1_fcwlrm5,1578040474.0,The Netherlands. There's a waiting list for personality disorders because it requires specialized treatment and there are only a handful of people at every facility equipped to treat such disorders.

A few years ago I decided that I would spend Christmas on my own. Dragged my mattress into the living room, got a ton of food and watched all star wars movies with my cats. Best Christmas ever.
