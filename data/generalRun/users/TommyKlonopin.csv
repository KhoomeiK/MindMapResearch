getdisciplined,fdj3aj4,t3_elhgf8,1578457308.0,Keep a journal and jot down things you want to improve or add into your life. Identify where you want to be and research the best methods to making that happen. Subsequently Make a schedule of what you need to do the night before and plan out your day. Stick to that schedule!  No slack!
getdisciplined,fdj366t,t3_elmyrj,1578457221.0,"I plan on waking up at 8AM and starting off my morning with a double shot Espresso followed by a 20 minute loving-kindness meditation session. After that, I'll check my email and read the news around 8:30. At 8:45 or 9AM, I'll do a light workout followed by a 40 minute run, getting back to my place around 10. Then I'll decompress, shower and get to work."
getdisciplined,fdj2x0u,t1_fdgcmg2,1578457041.0,It was great. Unfortunately I underestimated how much time I had to allocate to building the financial models. That ended being the bulk of my day. Today I kinda slacked off. Tomorrow I'll need to compensate. Let's go!

Late start. 

Thats OK. As long as I am disciplined going forward.
