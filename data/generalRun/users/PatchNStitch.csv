HumansBeingBros,ffe57dk,t1_ffdd4m7,1579837005.0,"Funny how a phone call from far away can bring you closer, even for just a moment.  My parents and I live within 10 minutes of each other, but. Brother is a 24 hour drive.  He was my rock in high school when I dealt with my first major depressive episode, and again when I've had my two suicide attempts.  When he called from basic training for the Marine Corps...even for the whopping 10 minute phone call they got on Christmas eve made it feel like he was right there ready to fight me with an empty wrapping paper roll like we did when we were kids.  He's 9 years younger than me, so I also have a lot of ""motherly"" emotions and stories of him growing up since I helped my folks so much.  

I'd call my dad or brother now after reading your story, but one is in bed and the other at work.  

Say hello to your dad from me next time you talk.  He sounds amazing. :)"
HumansBeingBros,ffe4pab,t3_eszist,1579836629.0,"This would be my dad spot on.  When I was in a crib, he took a hair dryer to warm up the sheets and blankets before he laid me down to sleep.  When my brother was born, dad took me to do special things so I wouldn't feel less loved or unimportant since brother came.  When I tried out for band at university, he came to my work and gave me roses as a ""good job"" message.  He has come to change my tire in the pouring rain, taken me to the hospital for numerous issues. Listened to me, stood up for me, hugged me, helped me move SO many times...and even though he doesn't verbalize it (though I DESPERATELY wish he would) I know without a blip of a second of a shadow of a doubt...he loves me. He is proud of me.  And if it is within his power, would do anything for me.  Best dad I could dream of.  

But I do know I am, sadly, in a minority.  My mother is my best friend and I have often told others they can ""borrow"" her as a mother for special events or whatever because their mom isn't in the picture or is horrible or whatever.  So many times, people took me up on it, shocked I was willing to share. Everyone deserves to be loved by their parents, biological, adopted, foster, extended family. Whatever.  

I hope you are loved, too.  All of you."

AskReddit,ffd1t1k,t3_esse9d,1579811735.0,"There are two in this story. About 12 years ago,  I was walking through a parking lot when a woman with dark hair and dark sweater pulled up next to me in a dark sedan and asked to use my cell phone.  I denied.  She proceeds to tell me it was a VERY important call. She had to call her friend in California (I'm in Arkansas) to tell the friend about a radio show that was on.  I denied again because I didn't have long distance.  She had me pinned between her car and the two I was walking through, so I couldn't leave.  She started screaming at me and telling me it was ""unchristian"" of me not to help someone in need.  Need? Really? That was easy to blow off, but then she told me I was horribly fat and my ass jiggles when I walk.  A complete stranger!  Yes, I'm overweight and have been all of my adult life, but I have feminine curves and have gotten many compliments on my backside over the years, though it is still one area that makes me most self conscious.   

She finally leaves and I'm so upset I leave the parking lot desperately trying not to cry.  I drive a short distance to where my brother worked for some consoling.  He was busy.  And by this point I was bawling.  Again, in a parking lot when a second complete stranger, blonde, light cream sweater, walked up to me and asked if I was okay and I just blurted out the story.  The woman was so very kind, she hugged me, wiped my tears away and told me it would be okay because that woman had a dark heart and I clearly didn't or it wouldn't have upset me so.  She hugged me again about the time my brother walked up and she got in her car and drove away.

The story sticks with me not only bc two strangers of polar opposite color and approach were there, but the second woman showed complete and honest kindness.  I wish I knew who she was, but...that's part of strangers, I guess."
