It is of real concern that Andrew has been prepared to offer laughable explanations for his friendship with a convicted Peodophile, and we know that his ex wife also knew Epstein (a Channel 4 programme showed she had telephoned Epstein's house a number of times, met Epstein at Beatrice's 18th birthday party and other occasions and I believe borrowed money from Epstein.

He remembered particularly when he was at Pizza Express in Woking because he, as a non sweating too honourable war hero VVIP, he does not typically go to high street restaurants. This is because he is a very very important person. 

Further, if he was in Woking between four and five that day, he could never have travelled back to Central London (25 minutes away perhaps an hour if the traffic was very bad, but he would as a VVIP have got a police escort to clear the traffic) that same day to be in Tramps nightclub by ten or eleven. He didn't even know where the bar was in Tramps for goodness sake! How would he have even found the nightclub? The photos of him coming out of Tramp's sweating were because he is a war hero.

He has also explained that although he is always surrounded by ""staff"" he had to stay in to look after his kids. Couldn't have gone to a nightclub then. Does he think we are as stupid as he is?"
