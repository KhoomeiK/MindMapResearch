offmychest,fdqzc26,t3_emu3i6,1578677292.0,No you’re not rude because I completely agree with you. These are very childish behaviors. Tell her she needs to learn patience and understanding because she is clearly lacking it in any way. I know some people (myself included) cAnt really grasp the concept of being an adult very well but sometimes you have to suck it up and at least act like one. Good luck with her my dude.

AskReddit,fdkv7q8,t3_eluch8,1578511842.0,"I was at an all time low. My mother passed when I was 15. I wasn’t close to my dad. Life kinda stopped. We lived in a pretty nice house, considering we’re not really that rich. One night, I climbed up to the roof and jumped, mind you with no real intention to end my life. It was more of a what would happen type situation. I fell maybe 30 feet— directly onto my back. Turns out I broke four of my vertebrae that night. When asked what I was doing up there I told them I was trying to get my cat down from a tree (totally obviously fake, but had photo proof of this cat and him in his tree) because it was cold outside. Lectured about how dangerous it was, never went to the looney bin. I have a therapist now."

offmychest,fdii29t,t3_eljxd7,1578443392.0,"If you’re at your wits end, try to avoid her at all costs. I know that probably seems impossible, but block and delete her from social media, block her number from your phone, and all that stuff. If she asks you why, tell her straight up. Tell her she has an ugly personality and that she’s rude to everyone. And if she bullies you, tell someone immediately."
offmychest,fdiho4a,t3_elketi,1578443142.0,"Honey, listen to me. First of all, you have nothing to feel sorry about. You have nothing at all to feel sorry about. It’s not your fault. If you still work at this place, I urge you to tell someone. I know you’re scared, it’s a scary situation. It shouldn’t matter who you tell. If you have a favorite coworker, tell them. If you have higher ups, tell them. You can tell your parents, you can tell the police. In a situation like this someone has to listen. And don’t worry about other peoples’ businesses. It’s not your business that you have to keep afloat. This scumbag could probably find another job to do pretty quickly. But from a person who’s dealt with this kind of thing before, do it for yourself. You owe yourself safety. It’s so much more traumatic when you have to keep it to yourself. If you just can’t tell your parents, ask your parents to talk to a therapist. Therapists do help, and generally they don’t poke their nose into these types of situations unless asked. But speaking of asking, I’m asking you to please tell someone and get this man arrested. Keeping your job is not worth keeping your silence. I hope the light finds your way."
