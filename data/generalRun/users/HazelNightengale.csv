worldnews,ffikzuk,t1_ffieztp,1579976386.0,"Agriculturally, Michoacan is mountains covered with shitty pine forest. How shitty is it? There are armies of kids selling blackberries at the trail-heads. Not black raspberries; *blackberries*, that are one of the few things to flourish in sandy, relatively sterile soil. *There is fuck-all to do there*; many of the Mexican immigrants I've talked to come from those hills.

financialindependence,ffijn7k,t1_ffigv07,1579975452.0,"Not from what I've seen- if you want a house with similar square footage/amenities, a neighborhood that doesn't smell like open sewer, and to take advantage of services without a language barrier, there isn't much to arbitrage- utilities tend to be more expensive as well. If you want healthcare providers that speak English, you won't maximize your value there, either. And many schools in third-world cities, quality means private school.

Prosperous upper middle class people do not give up their creature comforts easily. Not when it's still a reasonable choice. Implicit in their housing choice is addressing the crime rate- expats tend to be a target. This isn't Florida; in some places gated communities exist for a reason.

Retiring abroad for *cheap* means a two bedroom condo or townhouse, a compact car or none at all, and being fluent in the language. For an older couple living on Social Security and maybe a tiny pension, what they can get abroad might be better than what they can swing at home- they don't have kids to worry about and they might not afford as much healthcare/dental care in the US anyway.

WritingPrompts,ff6piy9,t3_eru94m,1579632182.0,"""You have *got* to be kidding me,"" Professor Potter said. ""You said that renovations would be finished by the time we started classes! The third floor looks like a bunch of cub Death Eaters had a party!"" 

Rayvn Tenebris, the renovation project manager, exerted all her will to *not* roll her eyes. ""We've been over this,"" she said patiently. ""The fire was listed on the real estate disclosure forms. The committees from Hogwarts *and* from the Salem School emphasized that they needed '*Cheap space, in a neighborhood tolerant of the odd monster or explosion.'* The hospital is within spitting distance; it's no St. Mungo's, but they do the job."" The Clortho School was already off to a rocky start. To keep things low profile, they'd left the *Sojourner-Douglass* sign on the building hanging askew. Ravyn frowned. ""Maybe, as funds allow, we can buy and renovate those busted apartments as dorms, but we must walk before we can run. In any case, the place is almost as invisible to Muggles as Hogwarts itself."" 

Hermione Apparated in, gazed around, and remarked, ""Well, three classes into Advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts, it'll look like this anyway. I'm sorry, Harry. I tried my best, but the Ministry will only release so much in funds for a school that isn't on English soil...""

Potter cursed under his breath about Brexit and unfavorable exchange rates. ""Use the contingency funds to hire more house elves to bring the place up to code,"" he said. ""Looks like this semester is shot...""

""Nonsense,"" Rayvn said reassuringly. ""Just set up camp in a couple of game shops and start classes in the guise of 'running a campaign.' No one will blink, you won't lose any time, and you don't have any full-time students here yet; they're all dual-enrolled."" 

""We need to accelerate enrollment just as badly!"" Potter protested. ""The Death Eaters, having taken over Hopkins, are casting their net wider and wider around the city!""

""But I've brokered an accord with the mermen of the Inner Harbor,"" Hermione pointed out. ""Soon as Druid Lake's finished, we'll re-colonize it with kelpies. Some of our more interesting operatives have discreet quarters at the zoo. We've gotten the goblins in the Zoning department on our side. If the Death Eaters try to make a move on Fells Point or the Inner Harbor, they'll be kept busy for *years* with the paperwork. *Breathe,* Harry!""

Professor Potter had needed a change and a new challenge; when the call for teachers for a new school went out, Potter had written back the same day. Leave the ossified British education system and help build something new...more nimble...more accommodating of non-traditional students. The War had taken out many wizards on both sides; the key to long term viability was training up new wizards. The US was mostly an un-tapped market. But the Headmasters and the Groundskeeper all met with suspicious accidents. Harry had been catapulted from Senior Lecturer to Headmaster, managing the later details about getting the new school operational. The place was held together with chewing gum and duct tape.

""Do we have any replacement staff?"" Hermione asked Harry.

""Luna will serve a detail for a few months,"" Harry said. ""That buys more time for people to make plans.""

""And the were-rats?"" Ravyn asked.

""Staying neutral for now.""

""And the art school?"" Hermione prompted.

""Disguising our entrance exams as a mid-term project. There's some promising leads,"" Harry admitted. ""At least we still have the Herbology professor; he's helping with that big hydroponics setup..."" Harry rubbed his temples. ""We're always outmatched financially,"" he sighed. ""Beauxbatons can barely pay its supplies bills...Durmstrang is falling apart...""

""We *need* a Bureaucra-mancer,"" Hermione said. ""Get Federal funding somehow. Couch it as counter-terrorism initiatives.""

Professor Potter, as well as the various countries' Ministries of Magic, had to look to the long game. A large country with a greying population meant vast supplies of Necromancer fodder. The darker factions of the wizarding world had knife and fork in hand for a death magic all-you-could-eat-buffet. The great thing and most terrible thing about the States was that *there was so much of it.* They had contributed food and men to the Muggle wars; the great fear was that soon they would contribute food and men to the Wizard wars, and to the wrong side. It was a huge, mostly un-tapped resource that *could not* fall into the wrong hands. New York had fallen years ago, but the rest of the country was still in play.

Exhaustion seeped into Harry as he admitted to himself a hard truth. This was way bigger than him; squarely outside his control and strengths. He needed to ask for help. Very specific help. He would have to eat a heaping helping of crow...but it was for the common good. Harry seemed to sag a little.

""Right,"" he said. ""Let's call Percy Weasley.""

""She's taking her afternoon nap. As I said, she's ancient."" I idly stacked sugar cubes on the table.

I laughed. ""Good man,"" I told Alonzo. ""I like you, and because of that, I will give you something valuable indeed.

Stolen dragon hoards now have no step-up in cost basis vs. the dates on the coins or era of the collectibles. If you go by nuismatic value, well, they've yanked up the tax rate there, too.""

I added as an afterthought, ""Go no further than the pantry- there's valuable spices in there, incidentally- but any farther than that and you won't have enough of a lead to escape.""

""Are you sure you won't get in trouble?"" Andali asked. ""Won't you come with us? Should we circle back with a rescue party?""

""I like my situation fine. Thank you for your concern. And to ease your fears, allow me a moment to grab something...""

""What could I do when it's me against five? Leave marks on me, though, and I daresay you'll piss her off."" I took a couple of pieces of paper out of my pocket and handed it to Alonzo. ""Here is the rest of the evidence against those crooked generals that I hid away, just in case. Take them to Queen Danntje or one of her trusted associates. It's her dowry the generals are squandering, and I'm sure she'll reward you handsomely for the lead and the evidence. Please exact my revenge where I cannot."" The rogue's face split into a genuine, unguarded smile. To Luis I said, ""There is a beautiful set of armor near the Faraund lute- it's midnight blue, beautifully wrought... and when I accidentally knocked it over one day, it made no sound at all. Useful for your next raid, I'm sure.""

Horatio stood up and stretched. ""How about we get this over with before Grandma wakes up?"" he said. They made there way toward the cave entrance.

""No traps or anything to worry about,"" I assured them. ""Just be quick about it if you value your hide."" My guests crept into the cave, ready for a grab-and-run. I edged off to the side, ready to watch the fun but not blocking their exit.

Several well-controlled gouts of flame shot off around them, singeing but missing them.

Once I heard her coming back, I placed my hand over my coffee mug so her landing wouldn't blow dust into it. She dropped onto the main ledge.

""I saw you got rid of that Armor of Silence,"" Pandroal said, unperturbed.

""That Lute of Impotence as well.""

""I still laugh over you mistaking that piece for an original Faraund..."" smoke tendrils came out of the dragon's nostrils.

""I tossed in those pieces of jewelry from the Xun Dynasty as well,"" I told her. I popped another cashew in my mouth. ""See? Like I said. Put a beetle trap off by the edge of your garden and the pests will flock to that instead of eating your vegetables.""

""I saw you got rid of that Armor of Silence,"" Pandroal said, unperturbed.

""That Lute of Impotence as well.""

""I still laugh over you mistaking that piece for an original Faraund..."" smoke tendrils came out of the dragon's nostrils.

""I tossed in those pieces of jewelry from the Xun Dynasty as well,"" I told her. I popped another cashew in my mouth. ""See? Like I said. Put a beetle trap off by the edge of your garden and the pests will flock to that instead of eating your vegetables.""

""Those Xun Dynasty pieces were ugly,"" the dragon said. ""Frankly, I'm glad to be rid of that drek. What do you have planned for dinner tonight?""

I was sorting a pile of loose gems when I saw movement in the scrying mirror. A few people were coming up the mountain wearing their very best tin funeral suits. ""Company!"" I announced to Pandroal, my employer. She swung her neck over to look. ""I am not delaying my afternoon nap to argue with a band of grubby thieves. You deal with them."" She ambled off to her sleeping chamber, her tail lashing with irritation.

I smiled. Few people ventured this way; I might have some fun this afternoon. Since I had a little time I put a pot of coffee on and set out a small table and a few chairs by the entrance to the cave complex. I added a dish of candied nuts from my last trip to the Duchy of Shiobar. I made sure my hair looked okay, tossed a few things into the spare bedroom, propped the spare bedroom door ajar, and grabbed a book to wait, letting the smell of the coffee drift down the path.

The adventuring party approached cautiously, and I even recognized one of them. I decided to ham it up a bit. I gave a loud, high SQUEEEE upon visibly recognizing the bard. ""Ohmygawwwwds! I can't believe it!"" I squealed. ""It's Gerardo Goldentongue!"" I knocked over a chair in my supposed excitement and ran up to the group. ""You're here! You're really here!""

The bard preened by reflex. ""You have me at a disadvantage,"" Gerardo said. ""You have my name, but I don't have yours.""

""Miriam!"" I squeaked. ""Miriam Levy."" I shook his hand with both of mine. I caught the rogue rolling his eyes behind the bard's back. ""Who are your friends?"" I asked. ""Please. Sit down."" I re-set the chair I'd knocked down. ""Here- let me get you some coffee, I'd just set a pot on..."" I brought out delicate, intricately painted cups and saucers. No one sat down yet. Damn...

""Please, have some Shiobar cashews,"" I tried, offering them the crystal bowl. ""It's a while before dinner, but I'm sure you're hungry after the trip..."" the mage had the pensive look of someone casing the joint, arcane-style. He'd find precious little.

""I am known as Andali Braveheart,"" the cleric said. She bore the holy symbol of the Temple of Light.

""Pleased to meet you, ma'am,"" I said with a respectful nod.

""Luis Tafalla,"" the soldier said, then bowed. ""The little twig there is called Horatio Cazalla,"" he said, nudging the mage as a hint to be more discreet. The mage blinked back to the social world. 

""Sorry, your name was?"" Horatio asked. 

""Miriam,"" I repeated. Formally of the Kingdom of Artor's Internal Revenue Service. But a few years back I entered into the service of Pandroal the Calm."" I sipped my coffee. Then I sat down.

""Don't you mean Pandroal the Dread?"" the rogue asked.

""Sorry, what was your name?"" I asked with my sweetest smile.

""...Alonzo.""

""Well, Alonzo, seems you did some cursory homework at least..."" I poured out coffee for the guests.   The dragon Pandroal has a vast wealth of years, and for much of recorded history was known as Pandroal the Dread. But two thousand years is a big milestone for dragons, and at that point they choose a different naming, one befitting their vast power, knowledge, and wisdom. And so my employer chose Pandroal the Calm. She's been reclusive the past few centuries; word has not gotten very far among human society."" I grabbed some cashews. Perfect blend of sweet and spice; I could nom them all day...

Luis raised an eyebrow. ""Pandroal the Calm is a name meant to strike fear into us?""  

""Think it over a moment, and you might understand. Do any of you remember your grandmothers?""

""Yeah. Tough old bird,"" Andali Braveheart said. ""There was no riling or surprising her. Zero shits given. Came down on you hard if you misbehaved, but never angry."" There were a couple of other nods of recognition.

""Yes!"" I nodded enthusiastically. ""Now take that dynamic, multiply it by twenty generous human lifetimes. Pandroal the Dread ascended to Pandroal the Calm. Can't fool her. Can't rile her. Can't appeal to her vanity.""

""Does she forcibly bend your face over a rack of smoldering chili peppers if you misbehave?"" Alonzo muttered.

""Uhh, wow, I..."" I gaped. ""What kind of childhood was that?! No, she doesn't bother with that. Mainly because she has her own fire, which she wields with perfect accuracy.""

""Yet you live to tell the tale,"" the cleric remarked. ""No visible burn marks, even.""

I let myself look a bit chagrined. ""Yes...well, it was a very near thing,"" I hedged. ""I was banished from the Kingdom of Artor's service and stranded nearby as punishment- a sacrifice to the dragon.""

""You embezzled, you mean,"" Alonzo said with a grin. He sat down with me. ""Do tell...how much did you get away with?""

I held my head high. ""I did no such thing. I ran into trouble when I discovered embezzlement. I recognized dark patterns in the tax paperwork among the generals. They were skimming money off the military spending, I knew it! So I asked for an audience. King Rigoberto saw me. Alone. I laid out my case. He listened intently, asked for my evidence. I furnished some of it.""

""Aaand you'd ratted out the King's old buddies from the military academy,"" Horatio said. He leaned his staff against the table and took a seat. ""Next thing you know, you're dragon chow."" The mage grabbed a cup, sugaring his coffee heavily.

""Yeah,"" I whispered, hanging my head. ""But the Royal Guard had the wrong location for Pandroal's lair. They don't want to stick around and test their theory either. I didn't look this gift horse in the mouth; I started heading downhill toward Shiobar. And then I tripped too close to the dragon's lair. She grabbed me and chained me in the kitchen while she decided how she wanted to kill and cook me.""

""You look surprisingly hale for a batch of barbecued Long Pig,"" Luis said. He grabbed a handful of the cashews but remained standing. His eyes constantly roved to different angles of approach- including from above.

""Well...I saw in the room across from me an original Faraund lute. And I made some small talk.""

""Wait-what?!"" Gerardo Goldentongue said. ""Herman Faraund, not his pissant grandson?""

""The inlays and decorations were a bit simpler, but the hand and mind that made it was obvious. The sound is the same; I'd heard one at court once. The dragon was impressed that I'd made the connection. Curious, she brought me a few pieces of jewelry to appraise. My father, rest his soul, was a jeweler by trade, so I knew a thing or three about that, too. That helped me get my gig at the Royal Internal Revenue Service. I was a master at audits."" I eased back in my chair. ""Since I'd found myself newly unemployed, I offered my services as Pandroral's accountant. The books had been in disarray for decades."" I poured a warm-up in my coffee cup."

WritingPrompts,fdyazkl,t3_en5iby,1578777883.0,"The movies always showed a sleek, shiny spacecraft touching down. This heap  was not it. The craft was dented, pockmarked with blast spots, and it sported an exhaust trail that glowed in the afternoon sun. The landing, shall we say, lacked grace.

It was the last thing anyone would expect to show up at the town's Easter Egg hunt. Right in the middle of the park's soccer pitches sat an unknown craft. The reactions were mixed. At least half the crowd dragged their children back to the minivans and SUV's, peeling out of the parking lot like they were on their way out of church and trying to get to brunch without having a wait.

A few whipped out their smartphones. A gaggle of children ran up to the craft; most being snatched away by their parents. But this diversion meant that they couldn't get to their parked cars without getting run over in the panic. Instead, they drew back to what they hoped was a safe distance. A few bags filled with plastic eggs littered the soccer pitch. There were murmurs of consternation as the craft sat there a moment. When a platform came out of the craft, the small crowd drew back a little further, but held.

Stairs blossomed from the platform. The door opened, and the crowd could see a knot of creatures inside. They gasped as the first one slowly descended. It was four feet tall at most, its skin the shade of the red clay of the South. Its black eyes were the size of the Easter eggs the children sought. Its steps were shaky, uncertain. The crowd was murmuring. The alien glanced around at the crowd, missed the next step, and fell ass-over-teakettle to the bottom of the stairs. It lay there in an ignominious heap. Then there was a small wail of pain. The aliens at the top of the stairs held back, seemingly torn.

Suddenly, a boy grabbed his mother's purse and ran forward. He knelt by the heap of alien at the bottom of the stairs. ""That had to have hurt,"" he said, laying a hand on the alien's shoulder. The alien sat up, skittering away a couple of feet. ""You're bleeding!"" the boy said. ""Green? Like Vulcans?"" The boy reached into his mother's purse. His hand emerged with bandages and antiseptic. ""Here,"" he said, ""Mom always keeps lots."" He opened the antiseptic. ""This might hurt a little, but you have to clean the scrapes first."" He gently dabbed the alien's wounds.

""*Peter*!"" his mother hissed. ""Get back here!"" She held a toddler girl in her arms.

""He's hurt, Mom!"" the boy shouted back. The alien flinched at the sound.

""Sorry,"" the boy said. ""Now the Band-Aids. These ones have Superman on them. My favorite. He can fly because he was born in a different gravity. Guess you weren't so lucky, huh?"" The boy started putting bandages on every place that oozed green. The alien tilted its head, watching the boy intently. The boy finished quickly.

""See?"" Peter said. ""And since you didn't cry, you get something."" He reached into his bag of Easter eggs, unscrewed a plastic shell, and grabbed the tiny candy bar inside. ""Here. These are good."" He handed the candy bar to the alien. It gazed down at its hand. Then it grabbed a gadget on its belt and appeared to scan the candy bar. Meanwhile, Peter had opened another and ate it, demonstrating. ""Try it. It's good!""

The alien finished scanning, then negotiated the wrapper. It put the candy bar in its mouth, then started to chew. At this moment Peter's mother ran up and snatched him away. ""Don't you touch him!"" she growled. The alien shrank back.

""Mo-om!"" Peter cried, then squirmed out of her grasp. ""He isn't doing anything!""

""Peter, *get in the car,""* his mother ordered.

""Mom!"" Peter cried. ""He's hurt!"" The woman stared down at the alien covered in Superman Band-aids. The alien gazed back at her solemnly. The aliens still in the ship had their hands on something, possibly their weapons. Silence yawned between them. The alien swallowed the candy bar. It wanted more; in fact it was starving. Normally its race wasn't so *gangly.*

""In church we talked about washing the feet,"" the boy said. ""Isn't this it?"" The alien was searching in the bag for more Easter eggs. Mother and alien's eyes met. The alien froze.  ""Son of a bitch,"" she breathed. She reached down for her purse and grabbed the hand sanitizer. ""SOAK your hands in this,"" she told her son. A teenager had crept closer with his smartphone. Peter's mother rummaged in her bag. She grabbed a bag of almonds. ""Don't eat more of those candy bars,"" she told the alien. ""God knows what they'll do to you."" She lifted the plastic Easter egg from the alien's hands. ""Eat these."" She gave him the almonds.

The alien scanned the bag, then addressed its comrades in a chirping sort of language. They descended the stairs and annihilated the bag between them. ""Right,"" Peter's mother said. She raised her voice and addressed the small crowd. ""Go to your cars, bring back your Goldfish crackers, your granola bars, your dried fruits, but *not* those goddamn Lunchables, let's not create an interplanetary incident."" She sighed and eyed the hatch of the alien vessel. ""How many of you are there? Looks like we need to rig up a pot luck here...""

WritingPrompts,fdrgpez,t3_empbqm,1578684266.0,"The light hurt Soran's eyes. He whimpered in pain. The guards made no comment as they hauled the scrawny biomancer out of solitary confinement and prodded him out of the dungeons. Soran's hands were still tied; he couldn't even shield his eyes. Three days without light took its toll...the guards dragged him to the main floor of the palace complex, down a maze of passage-ways. Soran smelled food and his belly rumbled; they had given him water only during his stay in the dungeon.

Soon they came to a section Soran recognized, and in a minute they had reached the wing that held the Emperor's study. The secretary gave Soran a disdainful sniff. ""Don't try anything funny, Elfkin. Your guards can sense magic."" The guard unbound Soran's hands.

Soran mimicked the disdainful sniff. ""You know I have no combat magics,"" he said. ""Were it otherwise, your men would never have captured me. Or my family."" One guard opened the study's door. The other shoved Soran inside. Seated behind the desk was The Exalted Aihara Kojuro, Overlord of the Kavumid Empire. On the desk was two bowls of lamb stew. It smelled *divine.*

Kojuro raised an eyebrow. ""You could have let him bathe and shave first,"" he said to the guards.

""That wasn't part of your orders, Your Excellency."" The guard to Soran's right said.

""I will be more specific next time,"" Kojuro sighed. ""Soran, please be seated."" The Overlord shoved a bowl of stew and a spoon toward Soran's seat. ""It's lunchtime- eat if you wish,"" the Kojuro said. He had given the order to throw Soran into solitary. Many other orders and dispatches were stacked about the study- the place looked like the cubby of some low-level civil servant rather than  the seat of an empire spanning the continent. A lowly civil servant would not have four elite guards posted in the room, though. The biomancer grabbed the bowl, drinking the stew straight- manners be damned, palace be damned, *Overlord* be damned. Kojuro ate his stew with small, steady spoonfuls. ""Have you taken time to think over our last discussion?"" he asked Soran.

""What else was there to do down there?"" Soran replied bitterly. ""And I still maintain that your plan is untenable. We agreed on a prototype; it was *not* a model that looked like it was made of childrens' molding clay!""

""Time and speed are of the essence,"" Kojuro told him. ""We need new troops *quickly*.""

""Do you want *more* troops, or *effective* troops?"" Soran countered. ""Quality takes time, and a different effort. Besides, the assistants you gave me have only so much stamina; they can't slap together major musculo-skeletal elements twelve hours a day. They need to switch gears, or they'll burn out and won't be able to fuse a single muscle. Time on the final details is necessary, and will result in a more effective product. My golems can kill swiftly, cleanly, with one hit because we take the time to define the fine motor control."" Soran drained his stew bowl.

""I make the decisions here, not you,"" the Overlord said. ""And I am telling you, in plain terms: *work faster.* Focus on brawn and blunt force. If making them *pretty* took no extra time, I wouldn't make an issue of it.""

Soran sucked in a breath. ""Bad enough that you kidnap me and my family and make me work against my own people. But you propose to leave my compatriots as twitching, half-dead smears of *gore* on the battlefield? Instead of a clean kill and an honorable death?"" The guards flanking him tensed slightly.

Kojuro stabbed at a hunk of meat with his spoon. ""You could make four *simple* golems in the time it takes you to produce one of your...*objets d'art.* My generals do not wish to hold the mountain passes only. They want to make it into the High Reaches with enough people to hold the place.""

""My daughter could have molded golem bodies better than those when she was *four,""* Soran shot back. ""May I remind you that you consented to release her once I submitted a prototype for your golem army.""

""It wasn't an *acceptable* prototype,"" Kojuro said, unperturbed. ""Too much in time and resources were put into the look of the thing. I need them tough, tireless, and able to put enemy combatants out of commission. Not necessarily killed. One of our Great Generals pointed out that grievous injury to enemy soldiers weakens a nation faster than killing the soldiers outright- they have to expend labor and resources on medical treatment. Those who *are* killed will have little time to contemplate the aesthetics of their end. Make the first contingent of golems to spec, and I will release Liza.""

Soran growled in frustration. ""*Quality* golems can hold the passes and protect your troops' retreat as they  run raids, *sir*. It would not put you behind schedule. And you need something better to show the nobles! To get their buy-in! I recall one of your poets having that line ""*A terrible beauty is born...*"" you have to milk this stuff for PR, Exalted One. Shock and Awe.""

""What notion does a half-elf bastard have about appeasing the nobles?"" Kojuro spat.

Soran leaned forward. ""More than you think- we don't just appear out of thin air, you know.""

Kojuro chose to ignore the jibe. He set his soup spoon down and looked Soran in the eye. ""Another rebellion has been quashed. You will use the materials gathered to create a platoon of golems within a week.""

Soren banged both fists hard on the desk and got in the Overlord's face: ""I *will not* have my name connected to the half-assed abominations you propose! I do this right or not at all!"" The biomancer was violently yanked back by the guards, knocking over the soup bowls in the process.

""Time in solitary did not subdue you one bit,"" Kojuro noted. ""Your antics have put me behind schedule- and so your schedule will suffer as well. Insubordination has a price.  Deliver me that platoon within a week- *and your wife and daughter will remain alive.* Once we have a solid Company, they will be released from prison, allowed to live in the city, and visit you. Once the High Reaches have been totally subjugated, and its waterways secured, I will grant you *your* freedom. Meanwhile, you are dismissed."" Kojuro addressed the guards. ""Take him to his lab. Give him an hour to ponder his options. If he does not begin work after that hour has passed, take Liza and throw her in the barracks. Allow her father to watch."" Soran started screaming insults in Elvish as he was hauled away.

The guards took him back to his lab and locked the door from outside. Soran started puttering about his lab to give the guards something to report and encourage them to be lazy the rest of the day. Once the coast was clear, Soran took the Overlord's soup spoon from where he'd hidden it in his sleeve. It was a basic fact of biomancy that every being had its own unique ""code."" Everyone knew that. What *wasn't* common knowledge, though, was that a useful sample from someone could be very, *very* tiny. Soren grinned at the Overlord's spoon. He dropped it into a small apparatus that would heat and amplify the sample. Within a few hours Soran would have enough for the platoon of ugly, half-assed golems the Overlord required. After a day he would have enough for a Company, and then some.

A few minutes later, Soran called for his assistants. Soran knew that his bid to work slower in order to buy his people time was unlikely to work. The Empire favored scorched-earth tactics. The peoples of the High Reaches could potentially hold out against raids and skirmishes until they could bring forth allies. But the Overlord didn't care if he razed the place; the Empire wanted control of their water and the mountain glaciers. They didn't care if the villages burned or the skilled workers vanished. A tiny, cowed contingent might be allowed to stay- nothing remotely resembling a threat. There was no negotiating with the Overlord; he wasn't even concerned with keeping the deals he originally struck.

Soran started fashioning the first golem. The fighters from the recent uprising had been well-trained; their brains would already have the framework for combat. Fortunately, adding a homing mechanism to a golem did not take much extra time. Soran started making tiny alterations to the poor rebel's amygdala. The Overlord would get the ugly, ungainly, crude golems he required. They would be done in time for the Overlord to show them off to the nobles. And *then* they would get their Shock and Awe.
