Anyone who’s had a stint going home and away with a shite team will understand. I guess you weren’t around in the bad days of Liverpool games home and away to understand
gifs,ffy6gpy,t3_evsmm1,1580339476.0,"The guy dropped to the floor for dramatic effect. He didnt feint or anything. He appears very reserved and if he just stood there all neutral like ""oh, you gotta be kidding me"" when he tells him its worth 400k would be very underwhelming. After all, he got this appraised on TV for a reason. He wanted to be on TV. He could have gone to an appraiser much easier and faster if it wasnt for the fact its on TV. Because hes reserved this is how he reacted. Over the top etc. Basically he knew he had to react in a way that was positively recieved and this is how he chose to do it... by dropping himself to the floor. More cringe than anything tbh but im happy for the guy, he deserves it."
LiverpoolFC,ffy2kml,t3_evltw4,1580337353.0,"So what.. If you're a loud liverpool fan in my home end I'd throw drinks at you too. If you're in the home end shut the fuck up and watch the game. You got no right to celebrate and disprect the home fans in such a audacious way. That's horrible.

This got upvoted because its jerking off the liverpool subreddit but seriously, if any fans were in the home end of my club and got rowdy when they scored I'd kick off too. fuck that. stop virtue signalling OP. I bet most people here never go to any games at all. Its infuriating to follow your team home and away 40 games a year to see some dickhead goad you in the home end. Fuck that. I'd hope they get kicked out for that. Maybe even a roughing up if they were being over the top. Straight up disrespectful and disgusting. I go to every game. Did a 9 hour round trip last week. To see my team get battered and fans having the audacity to sit in the home end and essentially goad the home fans by celebrating is asking for trouble. Just dont do it. Imagine being a West Ham fan on the brink of going down and some loud mouth liverpool fan starts clapping and cheering next to you. So disprectful. Meanwhile mr west ham has watched hours of shite spent hunderds of pounds and given up every weekend to watch them home and away and hes still turning up to see some knob having the audacity to cheer in the home end goading... WTF?

Fuckinghell. I would NEVER do that. If you sit in the away end as a Liverpool fan you DONT celebrate. Whats wrong with you people. Disrespectful and completely lacking self awareness. Like I said I imagine most people who upvoted this never go to games. Just watch it on their armchair at home.

If you decide to support a glory team and cant get tickets to the games because youre on the bandwagon dont expect to be celebrating when you gotta sit in the opposition end. Its basic stuff. Proper fans understand this. Its just not even an option to celebrate. Honestly Im not a violent guy but if people have the audacity to laugh at the diehard fans by celebrating they deserve to be kicked out and abused. Really poor insight here lads. If Liverpool fans sat next to me, having a grand old time disrespecting a team thats doing shit, probably going to their first game in 3 years because theyve came good, meanwhile everyone in the opposition end goes to 30+ games a year, I'd hope they got kicked out at the least and a stern talking to at the minimum. Maybe a few drinks launched at them for being such arrogant knobs."

Its not a child friendly game and as we all get older into our late twenties, thirties etc, you cant be grinding as much. The game will eventually reach sub 10k players like it did pre-updates and itll start dying. People dont wanna face facts. The game will get stale and the playerbase is aging. Theres no revolving door of new players. Not as many to replace the core playerbase anyway. The game needs to maintain momentum as nobody wants to play a declining game, or start rather."
2007scape,ffx30ey,t1_ffx2vay,1580316665.0,"Like I said, we're talking about the **typical** person here. I understand it's all relative, some people won't consider it a waste of time in the future. But I'd be willing to bet my life on the majority will regret it when we realise instant gratification technology has become a monster and the youth are all becoming shutins. Most successful people dont game all day. Fakts. The typical RS player plays a lot, hours a day. It's all relative too. How you define success. Wealth? Happiness? Social connections? I'd say success meant true happiness and **for most people** that means social experiences and connections. In real life. Like how we evolved to live in tribes.

I didnt dodge your claim at all. Im saying society is getting wrecked and happiness is going down the toilet. Success isnt necessarily money. Do you dispute this? Do you think modern technology and by extension gaming is making people less happy and successful in life? Remember, this is the typical person, dont be personally attacked. I feel like you are. Im a victim of technology too im calling out myself too. Im thinking objectively, not projecting.

I will go on record: Now, in general, is the least happy humans have ever been since homosapiens began. If nothing changes hikikomoris will become rampant. Suicidal depressed teens refusing to leave their bedrooms. Successful societies, successful communities, successful families, successful individuals need to take steps to stop dopamine abuse. Its not normal for humans to isolate themselves watching screens. It's not indicative of a successful human society. I do youtube for a living too.. I earn far more than my peers, that doesnt mean im successful, what kind of metric is that? Hunter gatherers woulda been happier, stronger, perhaps more intelligent than I. But again, its all relative, its quite a philosophical thing to ponder. All I know is community is dying and humans are community."
2007scape,ffwy158,t1_ffwxfbs,1580313571.0,"We are talking about the typical person here. If you dont want to face the facts that the world has a problem with instant gratification then you do you. But its highly damaging. The technological world is causing a lot of people to be very unhappy compared to if they lived pre-technological age. Dopamine systems are being completely ruined. It's why depression is on the rise. Its why increasingly numbers of youth are becoming shutins. Anxiety, mental illness, you name it. Its reality. Shall we just not address it and let people keep damaging themselves? A lot of people probably never even reflect on their internet, technology, porn, instant gratification habits. They probably dont know why theyre depressed. They probably just think its a chemical imbalance that cant be helped. 

I make youtube videos for a living too and im grateful for that but ill no doubt be happier pre-internet age. We are social creatures. We are becoming more isolated than ever because of instant gratification technology. I'd say you're being the ignorant one. Theres countless studies on how instant gratification in the modern world is doing us in. I'm not going to ignore reality just because some people will feel bad about it. There needs to be an open discussion about it else no progress will ever get made. Take high speed internet porn for example. Thats highly damaging but its taboo to talk about so nobody talks about it. A depressed person may think their 1 hour of porn a day habit has no impact on them at all because nobody is aware that its damaging. So they continue forever and suffer, not knowing whats wrong.

Society is causing depression. Its not the individuals fault, its our world. And if we never address it then humans are doomed to become increasingly neurotic. Suffering of millions of people that can be prevented if we can address it. Openly discuss solutions. Make people aware of addictions and instant gratification. Provide solutions and support.

Maybe its too late anyway, technology has become runaway. Take china for example, theres no going back. Tbh I'd happily go to one of them 'gaming addiction' bootcamps in China where you stay for a few months on a dopamine detox with rigorous discipline and exercise routines. I legit think It'd sort me out. Throw in some philosophy, therapy, education and introspection etc and I think that'd make millions of westerners happier. But if youre in a dopamine detox bootcamp you cant make money for the system, and its not profitable for big pharma to do that."
2007scape,ffwtjwo,t1_ffwsf55,1580310668.0,".Oh im not denying that, I play runescape too, im just saying I imagine people who neglected the present will probably regret the future. When we're like 50 and got little experiences under our belt because we got our dopamine shots from left clicking on tree's and monsters rather than doing something worthwhile. 

Im 25 and look back at the mega opportunities ive blown due to laziness and think 'why the fuck am I wasting/wasted my time'. I could have X or be at Y by now. It'll only get more painful. We're humans, our actions have consequences when we're alive. If the living future didn't exist it wouldnt matter what we did

Runescape is an easy controlled way to get that hit of dopamine that our brain dispenses when we do intuitive and worthwhile stuff. Like working, or achieving something, or working towards a goal. Its artificial. A replacement for the real world. Satisfying your brain in the meantime by tricking it into thinking youre achieving worthwhile things when in reality theres no point to it except from dulling the present malaise. I cant imagine many 50 year olds to look back at their prime years playing runescape in favour for making real life progress, real life happiness and real life experiences and think.. 'no regrets'.. Its gotta be the complete opposite surely. When I realised this I shit myself, Im thinking about quitting because the instant gratifiation fake dopamine hits is killing us all. Its why depression is becoming so common. Were all addicted to the internet, porn, dopamine skinner box games, social media etc."
2007scape,ffwrvgl,t1_ffw9v80,1580309518.0,"I realised this back when I used to bot. In like 2013-4 or something, maybe a year or two after release,  I was running 40 or so flax botters 24/7 and not one got banned in weeks/months. So I started botting on my main. got 99 wc, 99 combat stats, 99 mining, fletching, fishing etc. Then i quit and didnt bot when I returned.

I got 3 million flax btw, I believe it was worth 50-90gp at the time I was botting each but I cant remember properly.

Another fun time I botted was when they released partyhats originally. how it worked was in each world there was a partyhat dropped in a location and once someone picked up the partyhat itd spawn in another location instantly. There were maybe 100 or so preset locations all around the world. And they werent botting banners. Naturally everyone started botting this since its so easy to make a script to just click and pick up a partyhat.

So I made like 50 lvl 3 suicide bots, dropped them in the best and most obscure locations I could find that were 'bottlenecks', where people werent finding the partyhats more often then went to bed. Wake up with like 100 partyhats and at the first week of release they were selling for like 5 mill LOL. The hype was unreal. I made hundreds of mills. The funniest thing is jagex told everyone they were gunna be worthless but everyone still paid bank for partyhats in the first week. And the way they implemented it basically meant normal players got fucked. Botters could just go to bed and wake up with dozens of partyhats whereas legit players were lucky to get 1 in hours. Its as if they wanted to cater to the botters.. I loved that feeling of waking up to see some of my bots have like 4 partyhats on them. 20mill in one night on one account back when gp was worth a lot more. Good times.

Wouldnt surprise me if the devs such as reach did this intentionally with 300 bots lined up waiting in the predetermined locations for when it comes out on release. Remote access his pc, log them all in to the locations and make like 50 grand from RSGP. Knowing full well this bottleneck method of phat implementation with an item thats hyped so much will make BANK for people, especially people with inside knowledge. It takes like 1 minute to write a script to pick up partyhat ID and then continue waiting or hop worlds. Basically the most perfect update ever for botters wanting cash.

When you think about it runescape is unbelievable when it comes to potential for exploitation. It seems like auditing is poor there and the devs pulled some shadey shit like how partyhats were implemented. Whoever implemented it coulda easily made tens of thousands of dollars so so easily you'd be mad not to do it. If you did it smartly you couldnt get caught either, how they gunna link accounts to you when youre using vpns and obscuring your identity to the gold selling companies etc. All Im saying is you probably need an iron will to not skim off the top by using insider knowledge when its so ridiculously easy. I bet Jed applied to work with this in mind. He probs knew how easy it woulda been to exploit his position at apparently poorly run jagex"
2007scape,ffwrii8,t1_ffvxdbo,1580309264.0,"Runescape is literally just a skinner box to get an artificial dopamine hit instead of working on actual real life goals which lead to a better life. Similar to wanking to porn instead of finding a girlfriend. Obviously the main audience will be not so successful people. Successful people dont waste their time on OSRS for their fake dopamine hits, they go into the world and achieve stuff. When Jagex finally dies and the plug is pulled all those thousands of hours might as well have never happened, Whereas turbo johnny motivated that grinded on a business for his dopamine hit will be living it up."
selfimprovement,ffqzgun,t1_ffqxwcn,1580147112.0,"I convinced myself I have ADHD so I got a psychiatrist to assess and diagnose me.. but he just asked me questions for an hour then gave me the diagnosis. I felt like I was seeking it and he would have given me it no matter what since he charged £200 an hour. When my GP heard that I got diagnosed by a psychiatrist he basically belittled me and scolded me for trying to seek why my life is failing and that I need to take responsibility. I live in a really run down town in England so I imagine hes fed up of people trying to seek drugs legally, swindle benefits by feigning problems etc.

I read that adhd can often be missed in 'gifted' students since you can get by in the early days of school before serious autonomy is needed i.e. university. I never revised but still did OK.. until I started sixth form.

So I went to my new GP and asked for an assessment for ADHD for closure on whether I have it or not. I'd like to get on the medication if I have it because I always do really bad risk taking behaviour at the moment which I've heard is common for people on adhd unmedicated. The appointment is an initial assessment / meeting but its 2 hours long so I imagine its going to be quite robust. The endgame will be to be medicated and perhaps even therapy if they say I have it. I was on the waiting list for well over a year, maybe 2 years.

Yeah I've been pondering life a fair bit recently and concluded that potential isnt a productive term. Life just be like that sometimes. potential is more of an illusion in my opinion. Stuff either happens or it doesnt.

I try not to think about it much as I have a bit of a chip on my shoulder about being 'gifted' and being given a seemingly great hand for life yet im just squandering it. Ive bought something like 30 self-help books but it seems like theres something inherently wrong with me to fit into todays society. ADHD is my best theory atm. Like you said its fine to be mediocre.

Nevermind all the drug abuse and severe alcohol addiction and pancreas issues that forced him to retire from touring and had him in pain. Nevermind the fact he probably had a wealth of drug related issues not published for decency reasons. No. The answer is HE WAS MURDERED. [Avicii looked terrible (gaunt) towards the backend of his touring](https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/avicii-2014.jpg), that was 2014, he died in 2018. He was a severe addict and had bad depression, probably facilitated from his unsustainable lifestyle that forced him to quit touring else die. The logical reasoning is his lifestyle killed him if he was susceptible to depression in the first place. Touring is relentless. Full of drugs, lack of sleep, endless partying, random hotel rooms, its brutal you need an iron will to not smash drugs and drink 24/7. he admitted himself he was a severe alcohol addict whilst touring.

I remember one occasion. I was drunk as fuck in a bar with friends. Remember drinking a double vodka and that was it, blacked out.

Theres about 6 hours unaccounted for. Maybe more. Like 12 hours. I woke up in the train station with vomit all over myself and nothing in my pockets. Wallet, phone, keys, all gone. Really hope I wasnt diddled. Very shameful none the less I imagine people took pics and that. I gotta quit the drink."

GHB must be a helluva drug. If he managed to be undetected for so long. Theres been so many nights where ive gotten absolutely blackout drunk in cities and woken up in the gutter.. Been in one city then wake up in my bed in a different city with ZERO memory inbetween. Not even 1 flash, like i was under anaesthesia and wake up 1 second later. makes me scared if anything has happened to me.. You'd know... right? Tbh if something dodgy ever happened to me in the past and I got no STDs id rather not know.

Edit: turns out he targeted mainly heterosexual men but hung out in the gay village a lot nonetheless. Probably because gay people are wise to GHB. Perhaps some fetish too re: hetero men. Freaks me out because if some friendly unsuspecting guy welcomed me into his flat to charge my phone etc (which is usually dead) I woulda been a victim for sure."

AskReddit,fdcrcod,t1_fdcr994,1578282144.0,"Im not mormon but Im interested in it, one of my friends converted and I think its a strange religion and researched it quite a bit. Its the best religion I could think of that correlates with MLMs. It's basically the religious equivalent of a MLM. However, I must concede they seem to have a lot of the social aspects correct. Which leaves me thinking whether they should be bashed as much as I did in my original post. If you believe the means to an end which is happiness of the individual. We can learn from them with the social values, but again, it seems highly suspicious with all the missionary duties and tithing, and ultimately, the promise of an afterlife which appears to be completely fabricated and only exists to manipulate the believers

Heres a very interesting documentary from the UK. A young missionary from the UK goes on a 2 year mission and hes basically distraught. He appears to be completely destroyed and manipulated by his elder to not say anything negative. It seems very horrible. The guy had to endure 2 year of misery because otherwise he will fail his religion.  Basically crying the whole way through for a year. [https://youtu.be/-jORAciyGk4](https://youtu.be/-jORAciyGk4). One example [https://youtu.be/-jORAciyGk4?t=1438](https://youtu.be/-jORAciyGk4?t=1438)"
AskReddit,fdcp7wf,t3_eklnv0,1578280565.0,"MLMs prey on people that have little opportunities. They manipulate you with emotional aspects like asking about your personal life, telling you that you can work from home for cheap, make a lot of money, get out of your problems. Its hard to escape that when you got nothing. They're selling you the dream of getting rich when there's no other apparent way.

It's strange because some religions operate in similar fashions like mormons. They focus on people that are highly likely to be struggling to convert to become part of their movement, and then conveniently get them to give away 10% of their lifetime salary and in return they can go to heaven. Sounds legit. Similar makeup, but religions are untouchable. MLMs are painfully obvious. Fringe cults like the latter day saints are still obvious but hiding behind religion. Just donate 10% of your salary and heaven is assured friend. I promise. Youll even get to become a god and populate your own planet with your children. How about that? All it takes is unconditional faith for your life to the church and a portion of your cash.

MLMS and religions like mormons are basically the same, just a different scheme. Maybe I should start a religion.... faith has a far better pull than MLM promises. The promise of a perfect eternal afterlife is priceless. This post got a bit political and I didnt intend that, but I just noticed the parallels behind some religions requiring tithing and MLMs. Mormons are specifically trained to look for those struggling. Remind you of something?

Both MLMs and fringe cult religions have similar followings too. They're 'brainwashed', or trained rather, to ignore rebuttals. They're shown media that explains to them how all the negative statements against their movement is basically misinformation to misguide them. Therefore the people involved in these schemes are able to shut their brains off whenever anybody gives an argument against it, because they know that the rebutter is in-fact the person that is brainwashed. For example, victims of MLM's will be shown videos explaining how MLM schemes are new and in the future they will be recognised as the huge successes that they are, and everyone else is just naive. Same applies to latter day saints. The heathens simply dont understand. Milk before meat. (The mormon phrase of not giving any outlandish mormon information until the recruit is acceptably initiated so that they dont get weirded out by the weird info)"

Just the other day. Its hazy now because I forget dreams fast. But the girl in the dream resembled a girl I met briefly at a bar. We met up and spooned for a night and then she got back with her original boyfriend. She seemed so compatible with me. Anyway, in the dream there was someone that resembled her very closely. We were on a university trip abroad, went through the airports buying souvenirs, walking together to another destination chatting, I believe got a plane to dubai or some middle eastern place and went to classes there. It sounds so mundane but in my dream it felt very emotional. You know, one of them where you wake up and it makes you think of the person a lot more profoundly."

Ive only ever met one person where I truly have nothing bad to say about them at all. A true bromance where we have everything in common. I'd never say anything bad about him and even if he does something really embarassing or something thats 'not on' I wont think badly of him. I've seen him get high on acid (everyone at the party was) and he got really aggressive towards this gay guy and kicked him out. The guy started crying over it and his mate made a big deal about it after it happened. When he realised he was being out of order he started crying in front of everyone hysterically. It didnt change my opinion on him at all. Thats true friendship right there. I wish I had more friends like him.

Edit: I even read in the past that the reason why people gossip (women in particular) is because its beneficial for people in the community to know details about people. Its a strong social tactic to understand who can be trusted and who cant etc. Things to know about potential mates, things to know to protect your kids etc. Especially useful in the past. I.e. hunter gatherer days. Imagine if nobody ever gossiped about anything, we'd basically not know anything about anyone unless you were really close friends. It makes logical sense to gossip from an evolutionary standpoint"

He made constant pornography jokes in game and in videos and made very unsavoury comments about jagex. For rank 1 youd expect an ambassador of the game but he was out of order completely. He probably had autism and was a strange guy doing strange things like all the porn references in his vids.
