PrequelMemes,fffa637,t1_ffeyc5c,1579879454.0,"Yep, and it's great. It's a really good scene IMO. The New Yorkers are standing up for Spider Man and it's touching and nobile but *of course* they get schooled by Doc Ock. I felt it was a nice moment after that dumb bit in the first film where Green Goblin gets distracted by New Yorkers throwing things off the bridge at him to great effect and with stupid, stupid dialogue."

community,fff6gyi,t1_fff2z33,1579876930.0,"I think it's perfectly realistic. At least early on. Jeff is supposed to be in his mid 30s, he's probably about 15 years older than Annie but more important than the actual years is that she's very young. Besides they started out as friends in a group. He's smart enough to know how much damage that would almost certainly do. Last season, things are a bit murkier but they kind of address that in the finale."

I used to work in this bar in Brooklyn and these same two kids were sent in every other day. They were tactical as *fuck* cos it was these two little girls who would then make a scene when getting kicked out and the customers (not knowing these same kids have been running this for years) think the staff are being assholes.
