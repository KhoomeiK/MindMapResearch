The main issue that I have isn’t with those who struggle due to massive disadvantages, they should still try their hardest as everyone should, but it’s more towards the middle. The posts I see rarely come from people who are genuinely disadvantaged, rather there seems to be a large body of people who grew up with a relatively privileged setup and have failed to apply themselves. Call it survivorship bias if you want, many have had more opportunity than I did where I grew up and did far less with themselves, turning now to “the systems broke”. 

You have suggested a framework and it’s noble, the problem I have with these feelings based approaches is there’s no substance. How do you ensure people’s needs are met? Who pays for it? How far does it extend, one country, the world?

The system is more likely to implode on itself and then be remade into something worse than it is to be made into a utopia.
It always falls down when it comes to costs, then there’s the drive. How do you get people to work if their basic needs are met, how many will work? Will it drive a bigger divide between those who don’t work and those who do leading to them to become the underclass? Will everything above clothes and food become luxury items due to rising labour costs. Will pensions function, if so how, if not do we work till we die or just make do with basic?

If we change the situation to where you tripped and I ignored this completely then it would probably be seen as acceptable to do so but if I did this with a friend they would probably feel much more uncomfortable and embarrassed due to my silence.

Every interaction has to judged in context and that’s very hard to do from outside the situation as we have no way of knowing how certain groups of friends are comfortable with.

If it offends you to hear what others say to each other within their own friendship groups then you have to assess why. In this case you seem annoyed he used a word that is often used as a racist slur, but was his intent to offend knowing it was a racist slur or in his friendship group, private message I might add, is that ok. Why should he have to modify his speech to conform to standards not applicable to private groups of friends when interacting with them.

Even though you labelled it as sarcasm it still stings to hear knowing there’s people who think like this. It’s not sustainable, you need a life long healthier diet and not a one off weight loss and back to eating crap. No wonder they think weight loss is unsustainable if they treat it like a small period of time to diet and then they can resume eating whatever"

I haven’t really had any issues with transcoding, it’s perfectly fine for the most part, especially with hardware encoding.
With family I can have 5-6 streams at a time and with 3.5k movies and 200 TV shows it just isn’t economical to have re-encoded versions of everything.
I mean, to each their own but it just fits my use case better to have on the fly transcoding"

UKPersonalFinance,fctrwwq,t1_fctr003,1577956331.0,"I think there’s two types of people in this area, those after financial feeling of safety and want to pay off their mortgage sooner thereby having much lower core bills to worry about and getting a feeling of relief from the stress of losing their job (as an example). Then there are those who want to try and maximise investment returns in order to grow a larger pot to get that sense of financial independence knowing that regardless of a set back like losing their job they can still pay the bills they have.

I think I’m in the first group, I’d rather pay the mortgage off earlier."
LifeProTips,fcs4euy,t1_fcs0dhm,1577911313.0,"That’s the problem with people. We are all different, from a linguistics point of view saying sorry for your loss is appropriate (obviously if the person means what they say). They are saying they feel sorrow that you have to experience the pain that the event has brought you.
But people, like I said, are different and we react very differently from one another in our reactions. This whole life pro tip would be absolutely the worst advice for people interacting with me after a loss. In the times I have lost people I want to be left alone to grieve and would absolutely love people to offer help without imposing themselves thinking it was what I wanted. 

I honestly think life pro tips which are so subjective like this one are pretty useless. I imagine there’s a bunch of people who would prefer to receive food as help and a bunch that wouldn’t, a bunch who want people to check in and a bunch that would like to be left to it and reach out if needed. It’s far too subjective, like your aversion of not wanting people to say sorry for your loss whereas others would have no issue with those words"

fatlogic,fcb4iqf,t1_fcawr5p,1577582247.0,"I think the terms healthy and unhealthy don’t actually help much. Those two examples are quite black and white but foods are more of a spectrum from very healthy to very unhealthy and labelling them as just one or the other isn’t always the best way to show people how to build their diet. 

For example a lot of nuts are healthy foods, however they can be very high in natural fats so very calorie dense so while considered healthy they can quickly lead people into a calorie surplus. 

If they were saying we shouldn’t call foods healthy or unhealthy then that’s a bit much but it seemed more like they were trying to reframe it into a more explained situation by saying “yea, eat pizza if you want but be away that you should eat less of it because it’s energy dense and lacks vitamins, fibre and other useful stuff. Likewise salad is the opposite so feel free to be a bit more liberal with your portion.”

Some people genuinely don’t get the definition of healthy and unhealthy foods. They know what foods may be considered to be in each category but not fully understand why"

Fact of the matter is the statistics say they are dangerous, anecdotes say they can be the sweetest dogs ever. They are fiercely loyal dogs, say that kid has a friend come over and they start play fighting, as kids have been known to do, the dog could take it the wrong way and go for the other kids. This has happened many many times and is reported on many many times. Sadly cross referencing incident occurring immediately proceeding the dog attack isn’t often recorded but seems like it should be law to do so to determine more accurately the danger of the dog versus how it was raised"
