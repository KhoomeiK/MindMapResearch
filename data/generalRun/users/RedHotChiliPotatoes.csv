worldnews,fe5vcgq,t3_entaa1,1578875776.0,"It's 30° today. In January. In Detroit. 

I had a light jacket on today. We've yet to have a single day this year, only a few days in December that reached single digits (and we hardly hit them). 

Last December was mostly sub 30° with last January being sub 15°. This December, we had a few days inching towards 60° and only a few days ago it was nearly 50°.

Most of the low temperature days this January and December were mainly due to lake effect/wind chill, no snow. If you stood in the sun without the wind, it felt like Spring. 

AGAIN. In Detroit. In January.

Climate change is very real, anyone thinking otherwise is lying to themselves."

marvelstudios,fdeqxtv,t1_fddjnci,1578344758.0,"It's really not too surprising.

While movies are definitely made more theatrical and dramatic with music, they're typically more immersive and intense without music.

Two good examples would be the shootout scene in Heat or the subway scene in The Joker. 

The lack of sound force us to focus more on the sounds of battle, the things we would actually hear if we were there. A good music score does a lot for the tone of a scene, but sometimes no music at all draws us in.

I prefer either version honestly."
