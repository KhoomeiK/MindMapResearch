OutOfTheLoop,ffg4qn7,t1_ffg34k6,1579898425.0,"It's kinda hilarious watching the insults since they've clearly never heard a single episode of his podcast. He makes a living off making stimulating conversation with people from all kinds of backgrounds. From the straight-up loonies to the most prestigious intellectuals. 

That's not the mind of a bigot. That's the mind of a person hungry for wisdom and fresh perspectives."
nba,ffg2si5,t1_fffsi3x,1579897224.0,Now I'm thinking about how Top Gear/TGT could be even better if they had a 4th who was a straight man like Ernie whose job is to get those buffoons back on track.
madisonwi,fff2bdi,t3_etaa4b,1579873782.0,"I'd ask around the Monona Bay area for ice conditions and what bait to use. If you do go out there, watch your step for holes that have partially frozen over and haven't been marked."
patientgamers,ffczdf4,t3_esuqni,1579810383.0,"Great reviews. I also binged through PS4 exclusives recently and had pretty much the same thoughts. Although I was underwhelmed by some of the hyped titles, Dad of Boy made the purchase of the entire PS4 worth it."
television,ff6iiwm,t1_ff6gphd,1579627936.0,"I had played all the games and read all the books (albeit several years ago) and I was still going like ""wait wtf's going on"" every now and then. If I hadn't been familiar with the series I would've just dropped the show out of frustration."
television,ff6idq9,t1_ff6f16m,1579627848.0,"I also hated the main character at first, cuz he comes off as an extremely insecure ""tough guy"" and I didn't want to root for him. I'm still kinda meh on him, but there are enough great side characters for the show to be well-worth it. For example, Amos the actual tough guy is my absolute favorite side character."
television,feur54r,t1_fetracb,1579389166.0,"It was the perfect meme for /r/breakingbad during the last season when everyone was gushing over every episode and going over all the tiny details to predict what would happen next. It wasn't a mean-spirited meme though. We all had a good laugh at ourselves.

Those times and the first 4 seasons of game of thrones were probably my favorite times on reddit. Everyone so united in loving a TV series and looking for details to love it even more."
nba,ferxi31,t1_ferv6z2,1579359358.0,"I agree but for different reasons. People like to meme that he's stupid, but he's not. He's got a serious mental disorder and he's going to have a mental breakdown one of these days."
nba,fepy0r0,t1_fep3gze,1579334448.0,I don't really think of it as a joke tbh. It's clinically serious narcissism.
nba,feooen5,t1_feo6d0w,1579303018.0,I mean he's a flat Earther. He's absolutely used to making those kinds of mental gymnastics to ignore irrefutable facts in order to support his ironclad belief that he's smarter and better than everyone else.
thegrandtour,fed44dt,t3_eog543,1578997872.0,Their chemistry despite their very different personalities reminds me of what makes old TG/TGT work so well.
thegrandtour,fe6swzy,t3_env2mx,1578903883.0,This show is really scratching my itch for a good travel show ever since Bourdain passed.
nba,fdwgst9,t1_fdw7sqi,1578758514.0,"Every time I read a quote of what Rowling ""meant"" when she wrote Harry Potter I lose a little more of my suspension of disbelief of of the fantasy world. Kinda wish she'd stop making comments about the series and focus on something else."
patientgamers,fdw8c98,t1_fdvqog9,1578756108.0,"It's a damn shame we can't play older versions of PoE. Near beta, the game was a lot simpler and designed around hardcore gameplay, even blind. 

Now even the best players have to study new mechanics and do research before tackling new patches. The game's gotten way too complex for its own good, and maybe that's why they've announced releasing a complete rework in PoE 2."
patientgamers,fdw78q7,t1_fdvye6x,1578755817.0,"I feel like the story/character development is as much a masterpiece as any I've ever seen in a video game. The gameplay is good, but mostly just good enough to not be in the way. I would've been fine with the whole thing being a TV series."
patientgamers,fdw6h6o,t1_fdvpu5j,1578755538.0,"I typically avoid multiplayer like the plague for the reasons you've stated. But out of nostalgia I played a private server for a version of MapleStory that's 15 years old. 

For the first time in over a decade I found an online gaming community of like-minded people who actually enjoyed the game and enjoyed each other's company. The small number of active players (~500) ensured that any bad apples with selfish or toxic attitudes were on an unofficial blacklist from guilds and parties. 

Another case where ""patient"" gaming paid off."
nba,fd89drs,t1_fd6blsh,1578215424.0,The executives have a right to criticize because they want better ratings out of the superstar and want him to play at 100%. But I don't understand why fans would give a shit unless he fails to deliver during playoffs.
RPClipsGTA,fcjdjyu,t1_fcj7pbf,1577683894.0,"One of the reasons why he's so good at these verbal altercations is that he is rarely actually angry. In his default emotional state he comes up with these scalding clever insults. 

I mean don't get me wrong. The man's a true asshole, but he's smart about how he abuses people and one of the best at keeping it IC."
RPClipsGTA,fcjcrzj,t1_fcja4e1,1577683226.0,">The issue is that people get mad at someone roleplaying a police officer when they tow their car.

I haven't been really keeping up lately. Is this to all police officers or just Jordan? As I recall, Penta's been successful at playing a memorably *different* cop character who's an asshole to everyone, so I'm not surprised that crims, civs, and the viewers who watch them would mald at Jordan over even the tiniest of things."
patientgamers,fcj03xd,t1_fcih82r,1577673967.0,The crafting parts were fun to find out on my own. Advancing in the main quest was not. The hints were vague enough that you could spend hours wandering near the next checkpoint if you didn't get lucky.
todayilearned,fc8vxm7,t1_fc8r3a8,1577542889.0,"At the time of his assassination, MLK Jr. was not popular, even among black Americans. There's a whole spectrum of ideologies of civil rights leaders. On the left MLK Jr. wanted to uplift poor black Americans (as well as poor whites) to become god-fearing, civilized people. On the right the black power movement embraced creating a new culture that only black Americans could be a part of. Guess what the right called MLK Jr.? Uncle Tom. Race traitor.

The point is that even amazing human beings like MLK Jr. was called a race traitor just because he wanted black people to ""better themselves"". Cosby is a narcissistic psychopath who happened to have poor opinion of poor black people. How about we focus on the narcissistic psychopath part?"
todayilearned,fc8n9j7,t1_fc8liag,1577538391.0,"Why not? Because you admire one man and despise the other? Doesn't change the fact that calling someone a ""race traitor"" implies the speaker is either deeply ignorant or racist themselves. 

Think about what kind of white people would be considered a ""race traitor"" and what kind of people would use the term."
todayilearned,fc8jejx,t1_fc8hqdw,1577536179.0,The same term was often used to describe MLK Jr. before he was killed. It's an idiotic term based on the idiotic assumption that black Americans are a monolithic group.
television,fc7fxn8,t1_fbj53hd,1577506241.0,I did read the books. It's just that the show was a poor introduction to the world to those who hadn't read the books or played the games.
television,fc6wi8d,t1_fc6d5gy,1577491300.0,"Same. The show's not perfect, but they make a real effort with the physics (and pointing out when we should ignore physics and turn on magic) which I appreciate for a good world-building sci-fi."
television,fc6usau,t1_fc67dkb,1577490038.0,"That's a real stretch, tho. Even Omar's worst enemies would concede he's a masculine dude who likes pretty boys. He's like the direct opposite of an effeminate man who dresses flamboyantly for attention."
nba,fc6owsh,t1_fc69443,1577485790.0,Seems more like Most Likable (and also happens to be a great) Player at this point.
RPClipsGTA,fc04yk4,t1_fbze4kp,1577278783.0,"He and Lirik both strike me as people who would've become successful and respected without Twitch. They're just ... professional about how they focus on entertainment while they stream and gracefully avoid expressing personal opinions when it might create unnecessary drama.  

I've noticed a lot of streamers (in RP particularly) almost depend on their chat for emotional support. I'm not judging on whether that's good or bad, but when I tune into Lirik's or Mehdi's stream, I'm guaranteed to be entertained without having to worry about getting caught up in the latest drama and taking a side."
