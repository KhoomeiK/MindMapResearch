SampleSize,ffro7mk,t1_ffqsqpj,1580162144.0,Every survey I've ever seen on here is majority male. I'm also wondering how this happened.
dankmemes,ffro32s,t1_ffrnn4o,1580162066.0,"What is wrong with your brain.? You keep trying to assert that illegal gun crime shouldn't count towards mass shooting deaths. Even though illegal gun crime is the only type of gun crime.

Shooting death statistics are not meant to represent all the deaths due to legal gun crime. Seriously, how fucked are you?"
dankmemes,ffrngyw,t1_ffr7bgs,1580161695.0,I know lol. That's my comment.
dankmemes,ffrnejp,t1_ffrblln,1580161655.0,">They count under violent gun deaths which people use to mean mass shootings when they don’t have valid arguments.

Interesting definition by you. Doesn't matter though as you're objectively wrong.

Defining mass shootings as a shooting in which there was more than 1 casualty, gives 31 deaths. Nothing you say can change that."
dankmemes,ffr6zxu,t1_ffqudva,1580151819.0,"Important to note the meme is about death counts, not occurrences."
dankmemes,ffr6ph9,t1_ffqoqmq,1580151635.0,"If you pay attention to the meme they're talking about death counts.

Both are wrong. Coronavirus is at 81 and US Mass shootings are at 32.

You're also wrong. The things you mention as reasons for the number being ""high"" all don't fall under the category of mass shootings as they do not result in multiple deaths. Except ""illegal gun crime"", whatever the fuck you think that is. All gun crime is illegal."
dankmemes,ffr614b,t1_ffr5rgt,1580151222.0,I know. But I'm saying the info had to come from somewhere. Either you follow the chain of articles to an actual source or someone made it up. I'd like to think that the articles eventually lead to a source but if they don't then it doesn't really matter if it's Celcius or Fahrenheit.
dankmemes,ffr581i,t1_ffr54us,1580150720.0,So you're saying they just completely made up the number and news? The info had to come from somewhere.
dankmemes,ffr4x8i,t1_ffpzhsz,1580150534.0,Even if it was an American article it would still be celcius. The original scientific release would undoubtedly use celcius so the article would just copy the number instead of bothering to convert.

Says something about what types of ideas propagate easily)."

CrappyDesign,ff9s4ph,t1_ff95h36,1579720004.0,Yeah. I think this is supposed to be like a middle ground between the fat man variant and the standard variant.

MovieDetails,ff7w2n3,t1_ff7ghkw,1579659730.0,Parr is actually a fairly common surname. The actual name itself doesn't really have anything you can weave into a reason for choosing it for the character though.

CrappyDesign,ff7ttf2,t1_ff7q7tg,1579658201.0,"The difference is in the original you are choosing to kill 5 **or** kill 1. In this version you are choosing to kill 5 or kill 1 **in order to** save 5. Personally I don't think there's a difference but some people will behave differently, or at least reason differently to get to there decision."
CrappyDesign,ff7tjjo,t1_ff7bzbh,1579658011.0,"This is actually a legitimate variant of the problem. If you pay attention to the skulls it's clearer but maybe you need to be more familiar with it to understand, I don't know.

There is a variant where you divert the train and it kills the single person and by crashing into him stops (presumably this one guy is extremely fat or something). It is distinct from the usual version of the problem as the 5 workers are still on the same track. So the difference is (supposedly) as follows: in the original version you are choosing to kill 5 or kill 1, in this variant you are choosing to kill 1 in order to save 5."
television,ff6up81,t1_ff6njuj,1579635260.0,"In the show, Envoys **are** anti-rebellion spec ops. Takeshi is sent on a mission to quell a rebellion of which his sister is a part and then he defects - joining like-minded individuals. 

I haven't read the books, but my point here is that you are misremebering the show's portrayal of Envoys."

starcraft,fevwpgp,t1_fevdl9b,1579402406.0,You don't have to be a dick about it. These aren't bad at all. The animation was honestly pretty terrible. But these are definitely a level above.
GrowCastle,fepa849,t1_fep578x,1579315626.0,"Angel works but she's on a cooldown so she can't always defend. The turret works well to supplement. Poison Golem also works well.

No Problem."
GrowCastle,feok94w,t3_eq74gk,1579301366.0,"There's skills for summoners that you can acquire by conquering the right skill locations on the map. Cooldown skill won't affect auto summon speed but cooldown items will.

If you add in golems, use 3 and the ring (as opposed to 4). There is also a hero that buffs golems.

There is also a leader for summons.

Summons can have trouble with air sometimes so you may want to consider the anti air turret. The barracks turret is not too good imo but use it if you like.

I'd also mix in a bit of splash damage like goblin and zeus. The band hero can partially refill summons health and therefore time but generally isn't very effective. The gold passive on him is good too.

Summons are particularly strong at clearing the towns so I'd get them done when you can to guarantee regular gold."

GrowCastle,feajmgu,t1_feaiw1q,1578949611.0,What did you spend your money on? I'd guess you didn't do gold build but you clearly have got some gold increasing stuff. I had 1k on archers and lvl 200 heroes at lvl 350. Is there some part of the game I've just totally neglected?
GrowCastle,fe8zih8,t1_fe8wbze,1578932580.0,His mana pool suggests his castle is around level 450. But given his level is 429001 it's difficult to tell what's going on. He should be much higher level in everything. If he spent all his money on other stuff (and not castle as it appears) I'd guess his archers are a couple thousand by now and his heroes maybe around 300.
