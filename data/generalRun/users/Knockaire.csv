We cant even get in with each other, why do we think a brand new species would be accepted. We still kill each other over money, religion, food.... the wealthy have more than enough to feed the world but buy ridiculous super yatchs.

The world is no where near a paradise just a place where the powerful do what they want the middle class (slaves) make sure the poo is removed, the fancy houses are built, and the diamonds are mined."

The people of America do not value the same thing as me.... the truth, no guns in the hands of idiots, fair wages, personal time off... Americans are Trump.... they have the biggest economy and military (to a laughable level... cant afford universal medical care or education but can afford $718 billion for war).... so maybe we are all wrong."

Our families do love us and will miss us when we are gone.... we only get once chance at life and only 80 years to experience it. So experience it. If we are gone we never get to smile again.... and while we are going through the bad times smiling is hard but life will have better days.
