uchicago,feodxrs,t3_eq1xzz,1579298762.0,"STEM PoC PhD here. NGL a lot of the law students I've met (small sample size) are kinda strange.

Also my buddy was looking at applying here or Northwestern. Got morose vibes here whereas Northwestern was a lot more positive/supportive environment

My limited experiences aside, the law school is unashamed of their conservative reputation. I wouldn't recommend here if you're looking for a progressive, supportive, sensitive environment."

AskReddit,felgetp,t3_epkaux,1579221568.0,"My veteran stepdad is buddy-buddy with some law enforcement. Apparently cops in some areas (in this case, NJ/PA/NY area), will hand out these large badges to friends/family that they can mount on their car windshield next to their inspection sticker that more or less signifies that this person is with law enforcement and should not be pulled over. My stepdad  basically can now speed or make vaguely minor traffic violations with no repercussions. He was bragging about this to me on a ride once and bit my tongue on the matter of pervasive police corruption."

uchicago,fcu6x1j,t3_eiwwf3,1577974010.0,"Last year some unarmed 16yo kids from the south side robbed a GameStop and crashed their getaway car on campus.  They hid in Saieh Hall and were arrested.  On their way to the copcar some Maroon journalist thought it would be a good idea to take the kid's photo and put it on the front pageof the Maroon. The community was largely and understandably appalled because that goes against journalist ethics to reveal the identity of suspected criminals if they are a minor. The editors argued the community ""deserved to know"" who the suspect was. 

 Really bad look for the Maroon."
