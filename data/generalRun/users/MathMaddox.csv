Eve,ffflxhy,t1_fffgh5h,1579886803.0,Any AMD since the AMD 64 in the early 2000's has had an on board memory controller and does not use the FSB for ram access. I think Intel followed suit somewhere around the Core-Duo days.

formula1,fffiif5,t1_fffhije,1579884696.0,"I don't remember any more, I had to look up the the order of the races to remember China happened after Japan. He was racing hard in China when he only really needed to finish to win the Championship. Instead he pushed hard on his in lap and beached it on the pit entrance. 

With 17 races in a season, there are always a few events that can cause you to lose by a point, but those last three races were insane. 

It's crazy to think how unlikely Kimi was to win that year. If Alonso doesn't crash in Japan, if Hamilton doesn't crash in China, or finishes in the points in Brazil, or if we had the new points system 1-10 instead of only awarding up to 6th. Or if Massa doesn't hand the win to Kimi, or if Alonso manages to split the Ferrari's and finish second.  

That season was a roller coaster."
