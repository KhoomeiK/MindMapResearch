The mutations also allow it to reinfect people with a new strain and they all have different rates of infection and severity, unlike slower mutating viruses like chicken pox or measles.

Also if we manage to be proactive enough and manage to contain it, it might eventually peter out, though given how far it’s spread already that may not be possible.

Of course this is all speculation with such a new virus it’s properties are hard to guess or predict, and I’m only a biology student with a very basic understanding of viruses.."
