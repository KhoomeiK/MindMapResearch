tinnitus,fdouvet,t3_elrbs7,1578613405.0,Well it doesn't hurt perse but it feels like my brain is on a dIscO pArtY routine 24/7. I don't even remember the last time I slept alright.
tinnitus,fdouma0,t3_eluumo,1578613243.0,I can pinpoint mine.
tinnitus,fdouiye,t3_em06n1,1578613183.0,"Well every tinnitus story is unique, but yes you should have hope, people have stopped having tinnitus after it being chronic for years, so yeah it's quite possible. 

Tinnitus can be present to people with or without hearing loss, and it can be due to a variety of reasons such as somatic of psychological disfunctions. In your case I think it probably has to do with the muscle trauma.Can you change your tinnitus tone/intensity by manipulating the SCM, moving the head or opening the Jaw? If yes that would very likely be somatic tinnitus. 

From my understanding it's due to a routing error where neurons that are shared by the somatosensory system and the auditory system are firing off in the wrong area of the brain(auditory). 

It's like you ordered a package for delivery at your home and they sent it to your parents house. So what you can do is fix the initial problem and hopefully the packages will get sent to the correct address.

Try to keep yourself distracted and hit the problem from every angle you can, e.g I think you might need to see a dentist for a bite guard as you could be clenching your teeth due to stress induced from this which further aggravates tinnitus.

Good luck to both your and your mother mate, and don't beat yourself over this, it wasn't your fault, you couldn't plan for it and you very well didn't deserve this. But the past is out of bounds ,now just focus on getting better."

news,fcxfou2,t1_fcx7soy,1578061721.0,Lol this was literally the prevailing mentality right before wwI. It's nothing more than wishful thinking.
