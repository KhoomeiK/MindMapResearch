It gets me familiar with the place, a local shows and tells me about fun things... Frequently my lodging can recommend a tour company. I even did a night time Bangkok tour once. Good guides know how to keep you safe. Once I did a Segway tour.... It's so much more efficient if I don't have to figure out a few basics about a city on my own. It maximizes my activities and fun."
