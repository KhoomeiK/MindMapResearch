AskReddit,fep3789,t3_eq1wzh,1579311115.0,"Honestly, It would take a lot. Although I, myself have chosen a path where I can truly do what I love for my career, I cannot be happy unless my parents  get caught up on their mortgage so they don’t lose their house. See, both of my parents, and my big sister are alcoholics, so if they could get help for that, that would be awesome, but of course they’re broke and in denial. At least my sister goes to AA, but she’s currently in a half-way house, hoping to get some low income housing afterwards. Single mother of two, from two different men. One of which ran off, and that’s why my partner and I are currently fostering her 3 year old. It’s a mess and there isn’t enough help for single mothers. It’s hard to see a light at the end of the tunnel for them. Oh yeah and my brother just cheated on his wife of 4 kids and wants to leave her now. So yeah it would take a lot I think but thanks for askin"
