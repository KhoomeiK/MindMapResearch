He is offering solutions that target the issue versus throwing a bandaid on it. If we are so lucky as to have Yang as our President someday then please feel free not to opt in to the freedom dividend, stand by your beliefs and watch as we continue to automate away jobs. And just to clarify, Yang isn't some ""tech bro"" with stock market buddies. He has the 2nd lowest net worth on the stage.

I was mistaken on the electric car tax increase amount. It was originally higher from my understanding but later reduced. After looking it up again it appears it went from $35 for a 2 year to $251 per year. Thank you for the clarification.

The wasteful spending I personally think needs addressing is the shear amount of bodies of government we have in Illinois versus other states. One specific example is the school districts. Many of our schools are single k-12 school districts each with full administrative staffing. As in superintendents, asst supers, principals, assistant principals, and a slew of bloat staff that could be better allocated to allow more teacher funding and student resources. Consolidation of some districts could be beneficial in some parts of the state. This also applies to smaller towns having townships that only include their city. 

I think Illinois residents also see that we have one of the higher tax burdens in the nation but are suffering from significant debt, so the assumption is where’s the money going. I can’t pinpoint any one thing.

The others I’m mixed on and not as familiar. They also made electric car registration go up to 450ish dollars a year (because they don’t pay fuel tax) which I think disincentives people to buy green vehicles.

240,000,000 * 1000 * 12= 2.88 Trillion.

Second this is not something being added to the existing budget with out a way to pay for it. It will partially be funded by adding a VAT of 10% to qualifying non essential goods. Estimates put that at about 900 Billion in annual revenue. This will also be applied to companies like Amazon and Google to pay their fair share

news,fct7i42,t1_fct0yd6,1577934918.0,I think people generally refer to the selling Obama’s seat after he went on to be president as the corrupt part. Also the verbiage he used to describe a specific black person to fill it was pretty bad.
news,fct76ry,t1_fcrzjaa,1577934675.0,"Technically Rauner paved the way in his term with decriminalizing it and that’s pretty significant for a republican governor. Just to be fair. Also, with legal weed we got a metric shit ton of tax increases in Illinois thanks to JB."
gifs,fcow0y8,t1_fcoohia,1577843116.0,"Taxes mostly, the suburbs around Chicago are pretty solid. South of Naperville it starts to get boring. West of DeKalb same story. Incomes are pretty decent. Even entry level jobs like working at fast food places are paying $10 an hour. Nice places like Portillos  or Buona Beef pay like $15. So many food, shopping, and housing options. But yeah our winters can blow just like other Midwest states, taxes and fuel are some of the highest in the nation. Oh and rec weed is legal tomorrow if that’s your thing. I can’t speak for how good or bad southern Illinois is."
YangForPresidentHQ,fbenbjo,t3_ecz277,1576789522.0,I was kind of hoping there'd be some Yang x Glover collab gear. Like some cool band tee's but with our boy Yang. The poster is cool though.
