PC will soon begin to obsesse with it, especially after completing the first two stages, which are relatively simple. Each stage should require an INT roll to solve, each becoming increasingly difficult. 

At stage three you start requiring POW rolls for the player to resist messing with the box for a significant length of time. Failure results in them first feeling a pressing need to see the box, eventually causing SAN damage if they remain away for to long.

The beauty of making INT boosts the reward is that the player will slowly but surely solve the increasingly complex stages of the puzzle box. Allowing you to set the pace for his decent into madness depending on how large or small you make the awards.

Of course to give the PCs a fighting chance, you need a way to reverse the effects. This can be a specific spell (causing further SAN damage learning it), or as simple as destroying the Puzzle Box.

My personal favorite ""victory"" method, is that the effects can be undone simply by having someone undo the puzzle box stages, descending with equal difficulty, and a mental compulsion to leave the box alone (with accompanying POW test).

Not that any efforts you make on a individual level really matter. Only large organizations like governments and corporations could possibly hope to be able to combat the damage being done to the environment."
