i wonder how many people watched sovietwomble and his friends play arma or whatever and thought yup this looks fun only to then be disappointed by the game, because, well, the game wasnt the thing that was fun.

overhyped mediocrity being marketed left and right is what attracts these poor players. they play not the 'next cool thing', but what their favorite person plays or 'whats popular'. i hope i dont have to tell you why only following whats popular is a good thing. following expectations of others will get you disappointed real quick."

overall, ive enjoyed playing the main game for a long time before getting disappointed. atleast the way ive played it was quite enjoyable. i cant just play it for 50 hours or whatever it takes to finish main story and claim i didnt enjoy anything about it. i would be sadomasochistic to play a game for that long and only conclude that its the worst game ever or something. it would be silly.

you are being dishonest comparing it to shitfest like unity tho.

origins is a polished game for the most part, odyssey wasnt properly thought out and it shows. odyssey would have been a much better game if:

* cities were properly polished, the distinction between locations wasnt big enough (compared to all sorts of different temples origins had)
* pointless need for two protagonists took way too much time probably. could have focused on one and just made him/her more distinctive and have a proper backbone. obviously would favor alexios in this, due to the obvious reasons.
* remove modern setting entirely
* i can imagine the powers being quite godlike due to bloodline etc, but some of them were way too ridiculous
* overall game was trying to do too many things at once, get world too big, 1 too many protagonists
* dlcs shouldnt have been continuation of the main story"

this applies to what i consider to be 'migrants'. a huge chunk of gamers who have little to no loyalty, absolute sitting ducks for any hype coming their way etc. noticed that around the time of call of duty vs battlefield bc2 - battlefield 3 period when marketing and hype just told people 'you must play battlefield, because call of duty is for noobs!'. call of duty being sort of the same game every year helped battlefield a lot. the result? people who didnt actually want a team game, were stranded on battlefield. wookie snipers on the hills, while no objectives are getting done. then battlefield kinda also followed the trend of being the same thing every year. then dayz happened. the gamers from previously mentioned shooters flocked to that. twitch streaming got popular. oh those guys on twitch are having fun so i must also have fun? wrong. most people never had as much fun as select few clips compilation from a group of streamers. then dayz standalone. then pubg. fortnite. apex. definitely forgot to mention overwatch somewhere in the middle there as well. its like the flavor of the month (or more like flavor of the year/halfyear) attracts roughly the same crowd."

gamingsuggestions,fejh174,t3_ep46bx,1579173866.0,"For a little bit different suggestion - Inside. It is a 2d game in a dystopian world. Wouldnt call it horror, but it is super atmospheric, creepy game with amazing sound design. Can beat it in one or two sittings."
gamingsuggestions,fejgsgb,t3_epex8h,1579173540.0,"Katana zero is that sort of thing, tho obviously it is pixel art sidescroller. 

Door kickers is a smallscale top down swat/r6 game that has elements that you described.

My friend pedro is also a sidescroller, but might be the closest to what you want oute of my suggestions. 2d max payne with acrobatics with super kickass soundtrack."
gamingsuggestions,fejgavk,t3_ep4lbv,1579172861.0,Mademe think how great it would be to have a commandos game with rpg elements :(
gamingsuggestions,fejg97q,t1_feis6ia,1579172798.0,Maybe upcoming sequel will be better.
gamingsuggestions,fejg64e,t3_epdi89,1579172677.0,"Despite all the shortcomings of EA, origin subs are decent choices. Origin basic already gives access to such good looking games like bf5 or battlefront 2, both of which are now decent games, as opposed to controversies on release. And then you have access to hundred other games. All that for yearly cost of 25$. Jedi fallen order is also a fantastic looking game, but requires origin premium.
Cant believe im speaking favoribly of anything related to EA, but here you go."
Warframe,fejfs5h,t1_fejdy2a,1579172113.0,"We didnt really need new icons on top of new icons, while having obscure names for every new system. New equipment houses were introduced in patch notes, while they could have easily used existing 5 schools for consistency. No one can tell me a reason why that couldnt have been the case.
On top of that such info is shown in terrible way in almost every place.
Honestly I couldnt even tell you what a single ability icon is, what most of the effects are, because not only they are just vague shapes reminiscent of nothing, but they are shown at the top of the screen with a dozen other vague shapes while your screen is bombarded with special effects while you are moving at high speed. In menus more information is obstructed than before, needing you to press more buttons to view important info, or you are required to hover mouse on several things back and forth just to know whats what. Interface designers should be fucking shot then fired then shot again.
For reference I play since closed beta."
