AskReddit,ff2mdgc,t3_erakxj,1579513115.0,"I like that in my country we have several levels of high school and college/uni. High school goes from 'middle-level vocational education' and is aimed at people who are less academically inclined but might excel at working with their hands. Then there's 'higher vocational education', 'atheneum' (which is hard to translate) and eventually 'grammar school' (all increasing in academics and focusing less and less on working with your hands / practical topics).

Basically you don't just clump everyone together but already teach kids more at their level, I guess - often in schools dedicated to that level.

We also have a split in college / uni, where university is the highest and where you can get master's degrees, HBO which is where you can get bachelor's degrees and MBO which again is more focused on practical jobs. To become a doctor you go to university, to become a nurse you go to the HBO. Which level high school you went to also determines whether you can get into university or not."

AskReddit,ff2l1aj,t3_eramo0,1579511093.0,"Not very well. I was in grammar school and the bullying was purely mental, not physical - maybe if it had been physical I'd have been better able to deal with it. I was already in a bit of a bad place because when I was 11 my sister ran away from home, and I didn't have a lot of social skills so I was an easy target. I was desperate for friends and would actually just laugh a lot of the bullying off to 'fit in' and just hoped they'd start to like me and stop... I ended up completely isolated, started self-harming, in a desperate bid to ""bind people to me"" made up a story about a stalker so they'd feel sorry for me (I was 13 and stupid) but that came out so then it got even worse. Changed classes from 2nd to 3rd year but then my old class started talking shit about me to the new one and I started skipping so much school I was held back. Things went a bit better then in my new class, but my social skills were still shit and I was still super insecure and desperate so people still thought I was a bit 'weird'. Ended up being the first one with a job at age 16 cause I was a bit older than everyone else (cause held back) and a few people took gross advantage of that and I ended up spending my heard earned 200-300 € a month on buying them drinks and other stuff they ""needed"".

Anyway. I started martial arts at age 16, to grow some self esteem (didn't work that well but hey I'm a 3rd degree black belt as I'm writing this so something came out of it). I again stopped going to school during the 5th year of high school, self harm hit a peak, depression was at a high, got kicked out of school. I did finish high school in a separate, 'adult' school. Took a year out to work, then got my Bachelor's degree (didn't have many friends in college but no bullying) however when studying abroad for a year developed some pretty bad anxiety issues.

Depression and anxiety still exist to this day, I'm 28 now. I still find it hard to make friends at ""normal places"" like work, however I have a few close friends now (met them on Reddit) and am engaged to a super understanding and loving woman. (Being a closeted lesbian/bi woman probably didn't help my self-esteem when I was being bullied).

That got a bit longer than expected but hey - at least things turned out OK for me in the end so if anyone can take anything from that feel free."

You could've made it smaller or dismissed it but you didn't and that's a great start. I think communication and openness is one of the most important things, so honestly just try and talk to your partner. I've never experienced abuse in my life, but if I hit my partner or my partner hit me I would want to sit down and talk about it. And apologise profusely, of course.

AskReddit,fejmwzf,t1_fejdxbl,1579180266.0,"Yeah that's acceptable. My dad is a retired paramedic and he would come home after a shit day and just be 'Hey I've had a bad case, I'm not feeling very great. Want to help me with dinner?' No details, but just saying the case was quite bad. It would at least not make me wonder why he wasn't talking much.

One time that stood out to me was when I heard him on the phone talking to a support person from his job (he volunteered as that person as well, they can see all cases people had during that day and they'll give the people involved a call to see how they're doing). I didn't hear what it was about but his voice was pretty shaky and I left him be, years later I asked what it was and it turned out he'd had to cut someone in half to get them out of an industrial piece of machinery this person had fallen in to. Had died almost instantly but still had to be removed from the machine, so he... just had to cut him in half.

To counter with one of my favourite more lighthearted stories: when he and his colleague (they weren't as experienced) were called to a house in which the elderly (we're talking 90+) gentleman had fallen into the pond in his backyard and drowned, they wanted to preserve his dignity and took him out of the pond and cleaned him up a bit. When the police arrived they weren't too happy that they messed with the scene which technically could've been a crime scene..."

AskReddit,fejgcl3,t3_epfjje,1579172927.0,"Hmm tough to decide between when I landed wrong during martial arts training and fully ruptured my ACL and partially tore my MCL (knee ligaments), or when I had jaw surgery to have all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed in 1 surgery and couldn't eat anything but tiny spoons of yoghurt for a week.

First turned out to have mostly been the MCL being in pain, as the ACL was fully ruptured and therefore the nerves were shot too - didn't feel that one. But lying on the ground screaming in agony grabbing my knee was something I won't soon forget. Added bonus I guess: I'm scheduled for surgery (ACL reconstruction) somewhere in the next month or 2 so recovery from that is gonna be fun I'm sure.

If I remember correctly from my group therapy the majority of people with disordered eating actually have EDNOS. Like they're not restrictive enough to be called anorexic, they're not showing the right symptoms with the right frequency to be called bulimic... but in my case, they still end up crying in the shower if they eat 100 calories over their allowance for that day and refuse to eat if there's no label / scale to make sure that they know EXACTLY what is in it.

And that's not sarcastic, it took me many years of bingeing and actually making myself throw up paired with heavy constricting to then sort of be willing to accept the idea I might have an eating disorder when a health professional told me. So yeah eating disorders are hard, especially when they creep up on you.

Anyway, anorexia and bulimia are only a small chunk of the ED 'group'. I was diagnosed with EDNOS (Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified) which makes up for a large majority of people with disordered eating. So just because you don't fit neatly into either of those two, doesn't mean it's not real and valid. So again, good job on recognising it!

If you can get some professional help I think that'd be a good idea, it really helped me get a better relationship with food. Basically I learned how to make fewer rules, and make them less strict (carbs weren't wholly evil, having a cheat meal wasn't a huge failure after eating 1200-1300 calories for 6 days straight and exercising 2 hours a day). There's still rules of course, but no foods are completely evil they just all take up different places in my diet now. Really craving that brownie? Have a bit of dark chocolate and save it for that day out on the town you're planning on Saturday. Instead of telling myself ""I'll never eat sugar again in my life"", basically - which led to a binge on chocolate and cake and then making myself throw up because I felt so horrible.
