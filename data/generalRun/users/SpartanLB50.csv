CFB,fgkmxfm,t1_fgjs3kf,1580869212.0,You must not have been around for the Bobby or Slappy years. Only 2016 should be used against him and there are good reasons on why that team splintered like the Titanic.
CFB,fgkm34d,t1_fgjjx58,1580868705.0,"Hey man, we haven't poached a coach from you for 14 years. That's a lifetime ago, my kid wasn't even born yet. He still isn't, but he wasn't back then either."
CFB,fgklpdk,t3_eyvqzp,1580868464.0,"The football program that Coach D built at State was founded on toughness, effort, and a pure desire and drive to be great. It wasn't founded on ancient history, shiny new 5 stars, or a entitled mindset. My freshman year was 2009 when we went 6-7, and I'd have said you were crazy if you told me that we'd go on to win 3 conference championships and accomplish all that we did. Yes the past 4 years have sucked, but that 6 year run from 2010-2015 has created an entitled mindset within Spartan Nation. Sure we could go out and hire the next Dabo, but I think it's much more likely we'll get another Bobby or Slappy and not sniff another trip to Indy for the foreseeable future."

American Expressed called him and said that someone had stole his card and purchased $70,000 at a Walmart in Phoenix, then he said ""No, that was me!""."

The moment you say something like ""You're a horrible ump!"", ""You're garbage"", etc where you're attacking them as a person/umpire is when you get a tossed."
