And yes, mutts _can_ be hypoallergenic, but again, it's something that we BRED for and in this case happened because one of the parents (or both) were already hypoallergenic. And again, the number being accidentally produced is far less than the number in demand.

aww,fe65p5b,t1_fe24zmp,1578882371.0,"This is definitely a HUGE issue. 

With my requirement for the fullgrown dog to not be over 60lbs (for safety reasons), the small handful of dogs that my shelter did have were all far too large for me to feel comfortable taken, even if they had been good for any of my other requirements.

Not only that, but removing my own 'special' circumstances, apartments, rentals,etc. with size limits, breed limits, and so on and so forth... :( It's a rough situation."
aww,fe65jqt,t1_fe26cjd,1578882273.0,"For that one, you applied to be considered as a pet owner. If you passed everything, they created a personality / life profile on you and then selected a pet for you. 

I have had pets in the past, but it has been close to seven, eight years, and I've moved states since, so I don't have a vet referral because... well, no pets.

Our shelters and humane societies are dog starved - so there just never was a dog for me to adopt from them which sent me out seeking further where I ran into the other issues listed above.

And in the first house (i did not own), I had a HUGE chunk of land available, but no fence (out in the middle of nowhere). Second house is one I recently bought - had no fence yet. (We have the makings of one going up now!) So I have a dog run, membership to a local agility arena, a doggie daycare around the corner, and a few other things worked out for my girls!"
aww,fe653hb,t1_fe4c207,1578881974.0,"The lines are what create hypoallergenic dogs, and what create dogs that are suited to working in the police force, and to working with children, or in hospitals, or as service dogs. Without someone maintaining those lines, those dogs disappear. We will have no hypoallergenic dogs, or working dogs. We will have no service dogs, or any other kind of dog except backyard bred mutts that won't be suited for the jobs they're tasked with - which is bad for the family, bad for the pet, and worse for the environment when they start getting dumped at ever increasing rates.

aww,fe64tju,t1_fe6376p,1578881801.0,"Our local shelters and SPCA are doggo-starved! We have to almost exclusively ship dogs here from elsewhere. It's actually a big issue in the northern areas of the USA (and I think Canada?) :(

There was one dog that I managed to get in and meet, but she already had four other applicants and was adopted by the first applicant."
aww,fe61696,t1_fe4dfi5,1578879476.0,"I tried both, as well as shelters and rescues across the US. Unfortunately ran into many that could not shift a dog my way, or I ran into issues with inspections being unable to be completed, or with the fact that I hadn't had a dog recently. 

I also tried Petfinder, which resulted in a lot of rejections for the no recent pet (so no valid history) and no fence.

A lot of the places that did approve me (and had dogs available) only had dogs over the size limit (60lbs) or didn't have dogs that met the agility requirement and/or hiking requirement.

I tried for around 8 months before I opted to arrange pups to purchase. It was another couple of months after that before I finally made a decision.

All in all, it was a little over a year before I got my two girls."

aww,fe5zkyp,t1_fe4eqj9,1578878458.0,I tried this and couldn't pass the home inspection because I was buying a new house without a fence. Didn't matter that I planned on installing one or that I had a dog run or anything. I got rejected over a fence. It was stupid
aww,fe5ysuf,t1_fe2o1j5,1578877963.0,Can confirm! I live in Indiana. We have major doggo shortage in shelters around me. Cats not so much.
aww,fe5ynf5,t1_fe2amdp,1578877870.0,"All of the shelters around me are doing really well, so there's very few dogs to adopt. All of the ones left that weren't being fought over didn't fit into the lifestyle we needed, even before factoring in agility. 

I tried shelters further away but ran into issues with the home inspection, so I turned to rescues... and yeah. Significantly worse.

The worst one I personally ran into was a rescue that required you to essentially complete a personality quiz, and a home inspection, references, etc. And then you were either approved or denied, and if you were approved, they picked the dog for you. You had no say. 

A friend of mine tried to adopt a second dog from a local shelter near him (in TN) and was rejected because he had a puppy that wasn't fixed yet. (The pup was 3 months old and even his vet said he recommended waiting to neuter.) So my friend bought his second dog too."
aww,fe2adni,t1_fdxwkl8,1578836258.0,"I know this is a joke, but I figured you might be amused by this anyhow:

Pups have a tendency to try to join their owners in workouts, and a runnin' pup equals a poopin' pup.

Most amusing experience I have with this was when one of my aussie girls decided she really likes treadmills. She ran and ran and I watched and encouraged... and then there was flying shit from nowhere. I was so confused. And she felt so bad. 

In retrospect, turns out she backed to the edge and squated while running to stay on the treadmill...but the angle I had of her made it difficult to see what she was doing. It just looked like she flagged for a few seconds.

Unfortunately, since she insisted on staying on the treadmill, the poop hit the back end and got slingshotted off"
aww,fe242rm,t1_fe1dyj4,1578834267.0,"And what about working dogs, service dogs, hypoallergenic, etc, etc.?

The problem with the entire argument - both sides of it really - is that everyone is treating it as a black and white issue when it's not. 

Without breeders, every dog line will fail due to noone ensuring the lines are being kept clean, and then suddenly, we have no dogs appropriate for any job, be it emergency, agriculture, service, therapy, etc.

Most dogs are not suited to those specific roles, and even of those bred specifically for it, many of the pups cant fulfill the role because of the stringent rules governing such jobs.

Yes, family pets should be fixed. But blindly spouting that all breeders are bad is just idiocy. That is why you are being downvoted."
aww,fe20kgf,t1_fe1hhyd,1578833191.0,"I ended up buying because I kept running into dead ends on the rescue/adoption route. Now I have two beautiful Aussie sisters that I don't regret one bit.

Some of the dead ends I ran into:
no recent pets (my last was years prior)

home inspections (recent house purchase. Some wanted multiple for up to a year after adoption)

Wouldnt let you pick the pet

I wanted 2 dogs similar in age

I wanted dogs well suited to agility

I wanted dogs well suited to hiking

And I wanted dogs that were medium-sized (40-60lbs)
