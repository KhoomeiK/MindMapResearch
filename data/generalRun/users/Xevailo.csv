facepalm,ff72nh8,t3_es0ll5,1579639896.0,"I think the point is that many gamers concider the third game in some generations (yellow, crystal, emerald) as ""dlc"" games that just add on existing content. Yet, in opposite to the dlc for sword/shield, these titles are full games that one can buy and play without any prerequisites, for the normal price of a game. The new dlc on the other hand are not standalone but require either sword or shield to be playable, thus making them inherently more expensive (cheap price of dlc plus full price of basegame) than the standalone dlc games. This is better for people who already own the base game as these people do not need to play through the entire game again on a different cartridge, but worse for the kind of people who -back in the days- would have waited for the third release of a generation."

Persona5,ff6f6d4,t1_ff6ec1t,1579625866.0,"Tbh I actually kinda like the idea. Every floor could have a different setting (garage, groceries, clothing, tech) with unique enemies, and transfer between floors could be hindered by real-world events. The boss fight would obviously take place on the roof, and the whole scenario could be explained such as the ruler of the palace sees the world as a store, allowing them to take whatever they might need from anyone they want. Some real-world thief maybe..."
dontyouknowwhoiam,ff2l2l8,t1_ff2firm,1579511146.0,"**First off:**     
>Show me where in the medical books it says when the soul enters the new human body? When you can show me that, I'll grant that having a medical degree gives you authority on the question.         
     
It's not our job to prove your statements. If you believe that some soul exists then it's up to you to provide any scientific evidence as well as ""when the soul enters the new human body"". Scientific discussion is not ""you can't prove I'm wrong"", that's Kindergarten behavior.    
   
**Second:**     
There. Is. No. Soul.    Period!     
And no, it's not a question of name for me but of the concept itself, our personality being some form of essence that resides or permeates the body. People have tried finding it, but to no avail.
Personality is in simple terms just a chain of complex biochemical reactions in our brain, nothing more. So if you want to know when the ""soul"" becomes relevant, you have to look up when brain activity starts. That is the ONLY acceptable measure here, unless you want to factor in other made up, invisible, non-provable things that are totally 100% there.    
    
**EDIT:**     
Added first point in order to avoid double-commenting"
