I didn't have a recourse except to report them both, and they both still replied ""i didnt scam you"", while never sending the BCH.

How exactly is the escrow system on the website supposed to work? The website should release the BCH to me when the seller recieves my payment. But if the seller never confirms that he recieved it, there's nothing I can do?"
