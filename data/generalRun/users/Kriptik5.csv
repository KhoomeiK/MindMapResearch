pcmasterrace,ff9ruvp,t1_ff9ntap,1579719798.0,Downvoted for having a different preference? Nice guys.
AskReddit,ff1lrje,t1_ff1hel3,1579481263.0,"You couldn't be any more wrong. I'm responsible enough to be cautious with them, and I use them as the tool that they are. Nothing more.

You say you have children in your comment history, did your wife go completely drug free for every single birth?"
AskReddit,ff0cuvd,t1_ff09rbm,1579467657.0,"You're acting like drugs are evil. Drugs help people, and as adults we can decide what we want to do with them. Get your head out of your ass."
AskReddit,fezqiou,t1_fezla30,1579460379.0,"It depends entirely on the person, and it's incredibly annoying when people who know nothing about the topic try to speak on it. People who ""go outside and live their life"" are still very susceptible to anxiety and depression. I know plenty of people with great jobs and social lives but are still struggling on the inside."
AskReddit,fex4bmg,t1_fewwtit,1579424099.0,What a weird account. Not sure if you're just a troll or if you're *actually* that much of an edgelord.
AskReddit,fewzeb0,t1_few2t1x,1579421831.0,Awful advice.
PrequelMemes,fet4v7l,t3_eqhk2q,1579371801.0,You know what DK stands for?
Anxiety,feox8c0,t3_eq92aa,1579307360.0,"I also struggle when alone with my own thoughts, so I use any sort of noise to distract me. Keep a tv on, have some music playing. I've been sleeping at night with livestreams playing out loud on my phone and having another voice there helps immensely."
wow,felg95l,t1_fel8mh0,1579221463.0,Bunch of lame asses taking their volunteer work too seriously.
xqcow,feh19gw,t1_fegepc7,1579107036.0,Why is that a ban?
wholesomememes,fed3ozr,t1_fed3ie0,1578997246.0,r/hydrohomies has you covered.
Overwatch,fe3xi96,t1_fe21moi,1578853768.0,You aren't wrong there.
pcgaming,fe09ex4,t1_fdzneno,1578806778.0,Half the setups over at r/battlestations do the same thing and it makes me cringe too imagining it getting knocked over. Not leaving a whole lot of mouse room either.
Overwatch,fe08fmq,t1_fe01iyd,1578805894.0,Sigma has only existed in the game for like 5 months now. To say Orisa/Sigma are featured in pretty much all metas couldn't be any more wrong.
AskReddit,fe04lqg,t1_fdztzh9,1578802936.0,100%. Normal tp until there's nothing left and then a baby wipe for good measure.

wholesomememes,fdpczkt,t1_fdp3nvo,1578625510.0,A killer battlestation is all I strive for.
ImaginaryOverwatch,fdgiwby,t3_el98gn,1578398664.0,"I love it, very cool take. I get pretty tired of all the cleavage art with same-face around here."
pcgaming,fdc1q6e,t1_fdanj5t,1578265388.0,"You play with other platforms no matter what, unless you turn that off. I've been using m/kb since I bought the game and most of the lobbies I get into are console players."
LivestreamFail,fctyw6d,t1_fck8p0y,1577966350.0,Literally just bought the game yesterday. Fuck.
videos,fctkeew,t1_fctgas4,1577946444.0,"If people would keep their beliefs to themselves while respecting others beliefs, there would be no hostility or alienation. I'm Atheist myself and couldn't care less what religion people are, but there's a time and a place for all that."
pcgaming,fcsac32,t1_fcs6s93,1577913730.0,I miss fight night.
LivestreamFail,fcmrsfy,t1_fcmkbp6,1577789065.0,Wow who would have thought that a post-production song sounds better than a live one.
starcitizen,fcmg105,t1_fcmfi6q,1577773881.0,"The thing is that I did still try to go sell, and the sell screen showed an empty ship as well. Even double checked to make sure I was at the right place that bought what I was carrying."
starcitizen,fcmerjq,t1_fcl8umz,1577772593.0,"I dropped 30k on some cargo, only to board my ship and find an empty cargo bay. Decided I had played enough SC for that day lol"
Overwatch,fcmec1l,t1_fckrhun,1577772174.0,"You're awesome for that. As a kid I always wished my dad would play games with me, or at least show just a sliver of interest."
CBD,fciugmt,t1_fciud6c,1577670090.0,Lol it's hard not to binge when they just upload it all at once.
CBD,fciueoy,t1_fciub54,1577670052.0,The Witcher on Netflix. You might have heard of the games but the show is based on the books. It's pretty good!
CBD,fciualf,t1_fcitzam,1577669973.0,"Last I read they were aiming for 2021, season 2 filming doesn't start until early 2020."
CBD,fcitynv,t1_fcitwqd,1577669750.0,Lmaooo my man.
CBD,fcitx4q,t3_ehelh3,1577669722.0,I just finished it the other night and loved it. Bummer we have to play the waiting game now for s2.
aww,fciqcvk,t1_fcifpex,1577667313.0,"They can ""waste"" however much time they please doing whatever they want. Get your head out of your ass."

AskReddit,fch2lhu,t1_fch05w6,1577646710.0,That's another one I wish I could scrub from my mind. Be glad you didn't hear the audio.
AskReddit,fcgv7pi,t1_fcgqldp,1577644323.0,"Same here, I used to watch gore/shock videos just for the hell of it and got to the point where I felt nothing from them. Fast forward to 2019, I got curious and watched the mosque shooting video and that one broke the camels back. I felt more depressed than usual, couldn't sleep for several days and couldn't stop thinking about it. It might sound a little dumb, but I even went on reddit and un-subbed from anything that had negativity or toxicity too often, my mind just couldn't take it for a while."
LivestreamFail,fccc01u,t1_fcbzjhl,1577596673.0,"You're right, it's not. I just liked the arcade feel of it over other BR's. I didn't take it seriously and that's what made it fun."
witcher,fc97kpk,t1_fc68hnp,1577548297.0,"Agreed, but they have no competition sadly."
wholesomememes,fc8xr41,t1_fc8w9j4,1577543777.0,"I honestly thought the people who knew nothing about the witcher would be turned off by the timeline. I'm glad I'm wrong, at least with you."
starcitizen,fbwdba6,t1_fbvoeld,1577146914.0,Are you in a group? My friend and I were constantly crashing at the same times while grouped up. Now we just meet up with eachother without forming a group and we haven't crashed since.
