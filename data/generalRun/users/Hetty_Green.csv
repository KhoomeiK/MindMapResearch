ABraThatFits,feyu0i2,t3_eqxm18,1579450500.0,"FYI, a few US brands might use DDDD, but most will call the size after DDD a G(a few may call it E, but in UK DDD=E, some US brands use DDD/E), after that UK and US size charts will progress differently.

It would probably be beneficial to use the calculator from the sidebar and get a UK size and start from there. Then you can convert your UK size into any US brands you might find. There are boutiques in the US that carry the UK brands like Freya, Panache, Fantasie etc., and Nordstrom does too if you're close to one."

My grandpa managed it for almost 20 years without ever taking insulin. He was about 250lbs when first diagnosed, got down to about 180lbs at his lowest, maintained 190-210lbs for a long time. He just paid attention to carbs and monitored his blood sugar, and stopped overeating so much."

fatlogic,fdykm55,t1_fdyjqyu,1578780770.0,I wonder if that's a guestimation based on the mean they got or if there's raw data to back it up
fatlogic,fdxkspk,t3_en9y8m,1578769883.0,"Disingenuous statistics strike again! The average they always use for these things is the mean(adding every data point then dividing by how many you have), which is very much skewed by a few higher outliers like size 26+. I believe that if you poll as many women as you can, or take sizes that stores sell and calculate the mode(size that occurs most often), you'll probably get a smaller size, something around 8-12. That is usually more accurate if you want to know what size an ""average woman"" is wearing."

vaxxhappened,fdofnok,t1_fdoe6g2,1578604184.0,"Wouldn't say America is any better or worse overall, but definitely different from what your experiences seem to have been. And ""famous people"" represent an obscure minority of those that have learning disabilities in the US. Most are given varied levels of support and generally find a way to be productive or successful. The few you hear about are outliers that likely also had fucked up home lives and other issues beyond disabilities. There are a lot of factors at play, but ""ableist"" questions and the like aren't what make much of an impact on kids"
vaxxhappened,fdo3jsa,t1_fdo07v1,1578598238.0,"I definitely believe most teachers are decent and want to help all kids reach some kind of higher potential. 

There are usually certain classes for certain subjects where kids are separated. When I was in school there were also teachers that specifically went to regular classes to help the kids in special ed, the more severe kids that needed just babysitting were in completely separate programs or schools. Depends on the state in the US somewhat too. But like I said, most aren't going to overtly penalize kids that obviously have a disability or need extra resources, and in the US your GPA is just used as a metric against yourself, and maybe honor-roll/recognition type things in high schools. Selective private schools *might* take it into account GPA from elementary, but if your parents are willing to shell out the money for that, the bar isn't set that high."
vaxxhappened,fdnzcgr,t1_fdnykaz,1578595918.0,"Ah, America can't not accept kids to public schools based on test scores/grades alone, but there are special ed and alternative schools for those that need it. Also, like I said the world sucks and some shitty places may fail these kids, but a majority of the decent elementary teachers are going to recognize when these kids keep getting things not quite right and recommend special ed classes, tutoring, or therapy etc. Now whether parents coordinate with them and the kids get help is another thing, but most elementary teachers in the US are using questions like this to evaluate abilities. It's not outright ableist to ask the questions to see how the kids answer, it's part of the process to identify if they need extra help."
vaxxhappened,fdnxw4c,t1_fdnw14w,1578595078.0,"Nah, at this age(elementary) they'll use it to evaluate the kids abilities, as long as it's obvious they're trying or aren't getting it wrong purposefully to be contrarian little shitheads. GPA doesn't mean much in elementary school either."
vaxxhappened,fdnv9ak,t1_fdns2is,1578593541.0,"This very well could make teachers aware of a learning disability, ie. if they keep answering something like blue to these types of questions the kid may need help and if you don't give these questions early on you're not catching it to get them the resources they might need. Obviously I'd hope kids aren't being ridiculed or severely punished for not answering comprehension questions perfectly, though our world sucks sometimes."
ABraThatFits,fdkgjtq,t3_eltj8v,1578503409.0,"So you're definitely wearing too small a cup. The calculator from the sidebar gives 38HH uk or 38L us. Lane Bryant is US so your cup is way too small, and I think 38 is a bit too tight. 40H or HH uk may be more right, but your shape sounds very similar to mine, and our measurements are close in proportion, I'm a 32 band though. Very full on bottom is a bitch to find anything that doesn't push the wires down and unfortunately makes a lot of cups seem too small. Freya padded half-cup tend to keep lifted the best for me, but then freya molded cups like deco are all the wrong shape. I do have a lot of space between my boobs though and wide gores just push them farther into my armpits, so I tend towards lower gore or plunges as well. Panache Andorra leaves some space in the top, but the stretch lace kind of minimizes it under clothes. 

If you have a specialty boutique or Nordstrom near that carrys brands like panache, freya, fantasie and other uk/euro brands you see on this sub a lot go in, tell them your size from the calculator and don't let them push you into anything you don't want. You just have to try different styles until a shape makes sense."
AskReddit,fdke2tg,t1_fditsg9,1578501909.0,"Doesn't India also have laws about not naming your kid after any living relative? Like you can't have a jr. with the same name or name the kid after a living grandparent, or even a distant cousin happening to have the same name. That could make it really hard to come up with good names if you have a large extended family."
AskReddit,fdjzhpw,t1_fdjc5i1,1578492212.0,"Let him fuck up. Don't hold his hand through every little thing. Let him deal with non-harmful consequences(obviously don't want him severely hurt or dead).

I have sometimes wondered what made me turn out differently than some of my friends growing up, and one big factor seems to be their parents didn't let them fail and took care of EVERYTHING for them. I had a friend that didn't know how to put gas in her car until college when I showed her how. She went home every weekend and her dad just took the car and filled up, she'd been driving over 5 years without ever putting gas in. It took her a long time to figure out living on her own, she racked up a bit of credit card debt, but has finally figured most of that out.

My parents let me do what I needed, let me bear consequences for things like forgetting a project and failing a class, while I had another friend in a similar situation whose mom called the school and worked out some kind of deal so she got a passing grade. That friend never learned from her mistakes and now has 3 kids with two dudes and no custody of either kid. 

Failure is how you learn and grow-some of the last couple of generations parents seem to have forgotten that."
