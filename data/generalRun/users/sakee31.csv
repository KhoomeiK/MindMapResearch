It was during the great battle of Earth, two men fought in the wastelands, one short, one tall, the tall one was accompanied by his 4 year old child, and his bald best friend, who was a midget, they fought and fought till the other man created a moon (because a green slug destroyed it) and turned into a large ape, but, a fat samurai cut off his tail, then that ape turned into a man again, he started beating the fat samurai, until the 4 year old child turned into a large ape, then his tail was cut off, but while falling, he landed on the short man, since he was transforming, the short man now had a naked child on top of him, long story short, the short man who beat children is now my husband and we have technically 3 kids, 2 from the present and one from the future who is married to a woman 4 times his age, but her youth was given to her so she was 6 when he met her as a child, to make it more understandable, my 7 year old son is dating a 6 year old born in the 1980 and the year is 2020."

Advice,ff5ehya,t3_ernzkc,1579589444.0,"I sell rap songs, and I try to make them as unique as I can, but there will also be influence from another artist, every artist, fighter, musician, soccer player, basketball player, fuck every business has taken inspiration from somewhere, it is almost impossible to not take inspiration from somewhere unless you create something brand new (which is extremely difficult to do). 

Look at Pop, every artist is inspired by MJ, Bruno Mars is an amazing singer/song writer, you can hear some MJ in his music, same as Chris Brown, then you turn to rappers, you’ve MGK, NF, Hopsin, Kendrick you’ve got pieces of Em in there. 
Guaranteed that YouTube who you got compared to, wasn’t the first to do that type of editing. 

I could write a song using Eminem’s style of flow, or J Coles style of flow, but the reason why people won’t say it’s the same as Eminem or Cole is because the message, lyrics and wordplay is unique to me. 

There’s a rapper out there called Denace, the reason he isn’t big at all, is because his style is identical to Eminem, from the flow, the voice and the wordplay, it’s all like Eminem (at a lower quality), that’s why most people see him as Stan, rather than Denace."

If I did my research and my experiments, then released an article, and everyone took it seriously, all of you would probably die because I’d be wrong as fuck, at least then I’d have something in common with the antivax community. 

Science continuously tries to prove itself wrong, do you really think they didn’t try and prove themselves wrong here ? 

I can deny that, and I will, and even if they do care about their children, that doesn’t give them a right to harm others because they’re delusional twats. 

I’m not, for this topic I’m in the very common tier of intelligence, it’s just that antivaxers are so fucking stupid, they make me look like Stephen hawking. 

Mate, I’d call you and any other antivaxxer an idiot, whether I’m afar behind a screen, or if I’m a centimetre away from you. 

If scientists, governments and people providing thousands of sources can’t change their mind, how can I do it ?
