RedvsBlue,fc07xot,t1_fc05lh1,1577282327.0,"Freelancers weren’t wanted criminals until after the fall off the project and shit got revealed, and even if they were nobody would know who maine is outside of his armor.


 We also have no idea what the daily routine of a freelancer even is. Yes they were most likely spending their time training or on mission, but it’s not like people don’t get time off in the military.York apparently was out drinking with other agents, I’m sure Maine could’ve found the time to get a tatoo. Not every episode takes place right after the next

As for where he got the tatoo, He could’ve just gotten onboard the Mother of Invention or planetside. The Freelancers were training on various planets all over, so we know they made stops every now and again.



And again ask about what? 
Why are you putting so much thought into a simple tattoo?"
