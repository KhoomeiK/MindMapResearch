AskReddit,fdo5adl,t1_fdnu371,1578599140.0,"I think making sure a kid doesn't fill up on junk food is a lot different from refusing to allow them to eat.

I am not doubting your story, as anorexia has no defined cause and can come up from a lot of different issues, but I do think there might be more to this example.  Like, if he refused to eat a meal was he denied food until the next meal, or did he just refuse to eat what was prepared?  With our family if you refuse to eat dinner saying you aren't hungry we will set their meal aside and heat it up later rather than provide a snack.  

Was the family poor and unable to provide enough food?  Were three meals a day presented to them?  Were they offered snacks on occasion or never?  At what point did he stop eating, childhood, teen years, early adult?  Were there any other sources of stress that moved them towards body dysmorphia or food aversion?  Any history of eating disorders in the family?  Any major life events or other psyhological or physical problems?

There is just so much here that doesn't add up to a typical case of Anorexia and while this might have been a contributing factor, I wonder if there is something else at play as ""it's my parents fault for insisting I eat three meals a day"" sounds like a weird cause for an eating disorder."

MurderedByWords,fdhoanf,t3_el8wev,1578426862.0,"Once upon a time, I received actual formal training in the proper rules of etiquette in society, from making calls, proper dress, speech, and yes - dinner parties.  One of the things we discussed was the proper way to handle a menu when guests may have a food allergy or religious restriction.  We were also taught to hold veganism to the same standard as it is both an ethical choice, and the change in their diet over time makes meat a dietary restriction as well as their bodies simply have a hard time handling it.

But anyway, when you invite a person to a party that includes a dinner it is proper to include a menu showing them what will be served.  If multiple options are available, you should ask them to indicate their preference when they RSVP.  If you do not know or believe the guest has any dietary restrictions then it is their responsibility to inform you if they do have any restrictions that would make your menu unfit for them and to inform you of any allergies they have and inquire as to if your menu is safe for them.  

If it is an easy alternative to accommodate their restrictions, such as substituting an ingredient then you should do all that is in your power to make that accommodation or provide them an alternative that meets their dietary needs.  If it is impossible due to timing, logistics, or unreasonable cost or labor, you should invite the guest to join you for entertainment either before or after the meal or to attend and skip the meal portion of the entertainment.  It is also okay for the guest to decline the invitation at this time so as to not disrupt the flow of the evenings activities or to spare your reputation so that they would not have to explain the reason for them being absent from the dinner.  

You should you decline to invite entirely or uninvite a guest because of a valid dietary restrictions as the purpose of the party is the entertainment and company, and not the meal.   However, if a guest makes demands for accomodation not based on a valid ethical, religious, or health based reason you do not have to offer to make accommodations in the food offering.  A person who says they do not enjoy lobster and asks if you could make fish for them instead is in violation of proper etiquette.  You may politely excuse yourself that this would be a burden on your chef or the preperations for your meal and can then gentley warn them by asking them if they would like to skip the meal portion of the evening and join you just for the entertainment.  In this way they are warned that you will not change your menu and you maintain the proper decorum.  

A person who accepts an invite where a menu has been presented and who only at the event or after the event complains of either a valid or invalid objection to the menu can be excluded from future invitations and the host can safely and coyly excuse themselves to the other guests by stating something to the effect of ""I'm sorry, the menu for tonight's meal must have been misplaced from your invitation.""  At this point to keep the evening from being spoiled you can make a token gesture to prepare them something else to eat, or you can meekly apologize that they can not enjoy the main dish but beg them to stay for the rest of the evening activities.  As long as proper invitation procedure is followed, your guest can not complain about your generosity and inclusion."
MurderedByWords,fdhlww0,t1_fdhe8ah,1578425433.0,"There's a big difference between serving an alternative for someone who can't eat something versus someone who doesn't like something.  Religion, allergies, and even a vegan diet (due to ethics or health) are all perfectly valid reasons to prepare an alternative dish.  If it is a private party a guest is well within the rights of etiquette to ask about the menu and/or mention any dietary or religious restrictions they might have.  The host can then see if there is an alternative they can prepare or invite them for the social part of an event exclusive to the meal.  The guest is also able to decline the invite if an alternative would be too hard to make or the host is unable/unwilling to comply.

However, to turn down an invitation because ""I don't eat that vegan crap"" or ""Sorry, I don't care for pasta"" or any other preference based rejection is a huge breech of proper etiquette and disrespects the host as a proper invitation is about the person or the event and not the dish."

He died comfortably at his home, surrounded by loved ones.

My Aunt died at 37.  She was an avid athlete and followed a strict vegetarian diet with only local and organic food.  She ran marathons, jogged daily, and went to the gym 3-5 times a week.  She never drank alcohol, smoked, did drugs, or even stayed up late.  She prided herself on being in bed by 10 every night and up at 6.  One day when she was jogging early in the morning she slipped and broke her ankle badly enough that she needed surgery.  After the surgery she developed a drug resistant infection and died.

The point is, there are always outliers.  Does it mean my aunt shouldn't have take care of herself, or that my great grandpa found the secret to long life?  No, it just means that outliers exist, and life isn't always fair.

Sucks for you, but hey you aren't dead yet - so make the best of shit.  If you've got something treatable or controllable then do that and move on, if it's fatal then hey, sorry man - but  you at least know and you can what you want to do with the time you have left rather than not know and just drop dead at random one day.

I'm not the most motivating person, I know, but I just think the worst thing you can do when things go wrong is wallow in depression and feel sorry for yourself.

War used to mean that an invading Army would come through your country.  You might be conscripted to fight, and face a potentially brutal death.  Some invaders like Genghis Khan would subject those who they captured to brutal tortures before death that we can't even imagine today.  It also meant your children and wife might be enslaved or also killed.  Even if you surrendered you might still be put to death or enslaved under the new rulers.

Even if you managed to flee, your home would be burned to the ground, your possessions either stolen by the invaders, destroyed, or left behind.  There was no insurance either, you would have to start again, and if your tribe/king/nation was defeated then you were then a refugee and would have to beg for a chance to return to the most meager of lifestyles in the best case scenario.

He had followed the instructions exactly in the ancient tome he found in the bookstore.  A carefully drawn circle surrounded by a Voodoo veve, black candles, some animal fur, a little blood, and some cheap incense followed by some Latin chanting and the demon appeared.

The demon looked him over and smiled with his rotting yellow teeth, his black tail flicking back and forth with the speed of a whip.  

""What is it you desire mortal"" he spoke in a deep voice similar to an 80 year old man with a pack a day smoking habit.

""I want to be able to add the remaining lifespan of anything I kill to my own"" Samuel spoke his carefully crafted line.

""I would be willing to make that deal, but know this, upon your death, your soul will be judged as all men's souls are judged"".  The demon extended a long bony hand with black fingernails, which Samuel took.  With a puff of black smoke the only sign of the demon was the lingering smell of rotted flesh.

Samuel was no fool though, he had read his bible - mankind was put on this earth to dominate the beasts, it would not be a sin to kill them.  With this he could live for millennia, until he was bored with life, and his soul would be as safe as ever.  And if he saw the demon had tricked him and his aging didn't stop, or life became to much to bear, he could always just stop killing animals and insects and allow himself to die, his soul still intact.

The first hundred years he discovered that he was right to do so.  Although he did stop aging, seeing his friends and family die, and seeing the world fall apart and change, he longed for the embrace of death.

After 1,000 years he knew something was wrong, he had stopped killing after only a hundred years, surely he hadn't misjudged the lifespan he had stolen so badly.  He returned to the same place he had visited so long ago, and repeated the ritual.  In a puff of acrid smoke the same demon with his rotted smile stood before him.  Angrily, Samuel asked him ""why have I not died yet, I only ever killed insects, and surely not this many"".  

The demon laughed at him, pus and spittle flying from his mouth.  ""You foolish one, you said to add the lifespan of ANYTHING you killed to yours.  Every move you make kills thousands of your own living cells, every step crushes moss and microscopic creatures.  No, you will ive for eons, ever building up your lifespan, and when this universe fades into emptiness, you will remain for an untold eternity after alone.  And when you are finally done, you will curse the god that brought you life before you delve into madness.  And when you finally die and are judged for your blasphemy, I will be there to bring you to hell""."

To be able to drop $650 on one part of a Holiday celebration means that they probably spent a total of around $1,500 after drinks, decorations, other food, etc.  Mapping this out and assuming they spend somewhat the same throughout the year means that their entertainment budget is probably around $10k-$15k for the year.  Assuming they are keeping a strict budget and prioritizing holiday celebrations and entertainment and that accounts for 10% of their total budget, then their annual household income is around $100k - $150k.  This would put them earning in the top 4-8% of all Americans.

I am not doubting your story, as anorexia has no defined cause and can come up from a lot of different issues, but I do think there might be more to this example.  Like, if he refused to eat a meal was he denied food until the next meal, or did he just refuse to eat what was prepared?  With our family if you refuse to eat dinner saying you aren't hungry we will set their meal aside and heat it up later rather than provide a snack.  

Was the family poor and unable to provide enough food?  Were three meals a day presented to them?  Were they offered snacks on occasion or never?  At what point did he stop eating, childhood, teen years, early adult?  Were there any other sources of stress that moved them towards body dysmorphia or food aversion?  Any history of eating disorders in the family?  Any major life events or other psyhological or physical problems?

There is just so much here that doesn't add up to a typical case of Anorexia and while this might have been a contributing factor, I wonder if there is something else at play as ""it's my parents fault for insisting I eat three meals a day"" sounds like a weird cause for an eating disorder."

MurderedByWords,fdhoanf,t3_el8wev,1578426862.0,"Once upon a time, I received actual formal training in the proper rules of etiquette in society, from making calls, proper dress, speech, and yes - dinner parties.  One of the things we discussed was the proper way to handle a menu when guests may have a food allergy or religious restriction.  We were also taught to hold veganism to the same standard as it is both an ethical choice, and the change in their diet over time makes meat a dietary restriction as well as their bodies simply have a hard time handling it.

But anyway, when you invite a person to a party that includes a dinner it is proper to include a menu showing them what will be served.  If multiple options are available, you should ask them to indicate their preference when they RSVP.  If you do not know or believe the guest has any dietary restrictions then it is their responsibility to inform you if they do have any restrictions that would make your menu unfit for them and to inform you of any allergies they have and inquire as to if your menu is safe for them.  

If it is an easy alternative to accommodate their restrictions, such as substituting an ingredient then you should do all that is in your power to make that accommodation or provide them an alternative that meets their dietary needs.  If it is impossible due to timing, logistics, or unreasonable cost or labor, you should invite the guest to join you for entertainment either before or after the meal or to attend and skip the meal portion of the entertainment.  It is also okay for the guest to decline the invitation at this time so as to not disrupt the flow of the evenings activities or to spare your reputation so that they would not have to explain the reason for them being absent from the dinner.  

You should you decline to invite entirely or uninvite a guest because of a valid dietary restrictions as the purpose of the party is the entertainment and company, and not the meal.   However, if a guest makes demands for accomodation not based on a valid ethical, religious, or health based reason you do not have to offer to make accommodations in the food offering.  A person who says they do not enjoy lobster and asks if you could make fish for them instead is in violation of proper etiquette.  You may politely excuse yourself that this would be a burden on your chef or the preperations for your meal and can then gentley warn them by asking them if they would like to skip the meal portion of the evening and join you just for the entertainment.  In this way they are warned that you will not change your menu and you maintain the proper decorum.  

A person who accepts an invite where a menu has been presented and who only at the event or after the event complains of either a valid or invalid objection to the menu can be excluded from future invitations and the host can safely and coyly excuse themselves to the other guests by stating something to the effect of ""I'm sorry, the menu for tonight's meal must have been misplaced from your invitation.""  At this point to keep the evening from being spoiled you can make a token gesture to prepare them something else to eat, or you can meekly apologize that they can not enjoy the main dish but beg them to stay for the rest of the evening activities.  As long as proper invitation procedure is followed, your guest can not complain about your generosity and inclusion."
MurderedByWords,fdhlww0,t1_fdhe8ah,1578425433.0,"There's a big difference between serving an alternative for someone who can't eat something versus someone who doesn't like something.  Religion, allergies, and even a vegan diet (due to ethics or health) are all perfectly valid reasons to prepare an alternative dish.  If it is a private party a guest is well within the rights of etiquette to ask about the menu and/or mention any dietary or religious restrictions they might have.  The host can then see if there is an alternative they can prepare or invite them for the social part of an event exclusive to the meal.  The guest is also able to decline the invite if an alternative would be too hard to make or the host is unable/unwilling to comply.

However, to turn down an invitation because ""I don't eat that vegan crap"" or ""Sorry, I don't care for pasta"" or any other preference based rejection is a huge breech of proper etiquette and disrespects the host as a proper invitation is about the person or the event and not the dish."

War used to mean that an invading Army would come through your country.  You might be conscripted to fight, and face a potentially brutal death.  Some invaders like Genghis Khan would subject those who they captured to brutal tortures before death that we can't even imagine today.  It also meant your children and wife might be enslaved or also killed.  Even if you surrendered you might still be put to death or enslaved under the new rulers.

Even if you managed to flee, your home would be burned to the ground, your possessions either stolen by the invaders, destroyed, or left behind.  There was no insurance either, you would have to start again, and if your tribe/king/nation was defeated then you were then a refugee and would have to beg for a chance to return to the most meager of lifestyles in the best case scenario.  Most likely you would simply die of starvation, disease, or exposure.

So unless you are actually a current member of the armed forces, what do you really think is going to happen to you?  Yeah you could technically happen to be in an area where an Iranian sponsored terrorist attack happened to occur successfully but you are much more likely to die in a traffic accident.

That said - as a former member of the armed forces and friend of many current service members, screw Trump for putting us in this situation where we might need to disrupt hundreds of thousands of lives in order to kill one man for a very tenuous reason.

He had followed the instructions exactly in the ancient tome he found in the bookstore.  A carefully drawn circle surrounded by a Voodoo veve, black candles, some animal fur, a little blood, and some cheap incense followed by some Latin chanting and the demon appeared.

The demon looked him over and smiled with his rotting yellow teeth, his black tail flicking back and forth with the speed of a whip.  

""What is it you desire mortal"" he spoke in a deep voice similar to an 80 year old man with a pack a day smoking habit.

""I want to be able to add the remaining lifespan of anything I kill to my own"" Samuel spoke his carefully crafted line.

""I would be willing to make that deal, but know this, upon your death, your soul will be judged as all men's souls are judged"".  The demon extended a long bony hand with black fingernails, which Samuel took.  With a puff of black smoke the only sign of the demon was the lingering smell of rotted flesh.

Samuel was no fool though, he had read his bible - mankind was put on this earth to dominate the beasts, it would not be a sin to kill them.  With this he could live for millennia, until he was bored with life, and his soul would be as safe as ever.  And if he saw the demon had tricked him and his aging didn't stop, or life became to much to bear, he could always just stop killing animals and insects and allow himself to die, his soul still intact.

The first hundred years he discovered that he was right to do so.  Although he did stop aging, seeing his friends and family die, and seeing the world fall apart and change, he longed for the embrace of death.

After 1,000 years he knew something was wrong, he had stopped killing after only a hundred years, surely he hadn't misjudged the lifespan he had stolen so badly.  He returned to the same place he had visited so long ago, and repeated the ritual.  In a puff of acrid smoke the same demon with his rotted smile stood before him.  Angrily, Samuel asked him ""why have I not died yet, I only ever killed insects, and surely not this many"".  

The demon laughed at him, pus and spittle flying from his mouth.  ""You foolish one, you said to add the lifespan of ANYTHING you killed to yours.  Every move you make kills thousands of your own living cells, every step crushes moss and microscopic creatures.  No, you will ive for eons, ever building up your lifespan, and when this universe fades into emptiness, you will remain for an untold eternity after alone.  And when you are finally done, you will curse the god that brought you life before you delve into madness.

I wanted to quit for good, and having failed with the gum and cold turkey I went out and bought one of those vape mods that sell for about $80 and started with what I thought was a really high nicotine level of 18mg.  My local vape shop helped me out describing how I could use my device to track how much I was using my device and set up a plan to ""step down"" my nicotine intake gradually.  After about a year I was done with vaping as well and it's been years without me having any craving.  At one point in the middle of this (about 5 months in), I took a family vacation to Disney, and went to the park one day from 8AM to 9PM.

Imagine this is the opening level - you start fighting a fire in the woods as a tutorial and get the call to evacuate,  you hop in the fire truck and drive through this.  Later on in the story line we change things up and there's a living fire spirit laying waste to everything across the Outback slowly heading towards Sydney.  You have to stop him before he gets there, fighting fires, building fire breaks, calling in helicopters to drop water, and rescuing people as you go."

This gives me a huge variety of shows to watch, Good Omens, Peaky Blinders, Black Mirror, Runaways, South Park, Simpsons, Disney movies, Mandalorian, etc.  There's always something to binge, it's cheaper than cable, and I don't have to watch 5 minutes of commercials for every 10 minutes of TV anymore. 

Combine this with YouTube, IMDB, and Tubi and others and you can get just about anything you want if you're OK with a few ads or paying a bit more."

CrazyIdeas,fckrpcy,t1_fciwh0z,1577731744.0,"There have been cases like this where discrimination based on name has been observed.  Applicants with otherwise identical experience, work history, education, etc are examined and those with more ethnic names have to send out more resumes on average to get the same number of interviews/call backs.  There have also been studies done where hiring managers are asked to select 5 candidates from a stack of nearly identical resumes and will tend to select those with more traditional names over other qualified applicants at a disproportionate rate.  The same also applies to women.

news,fc624tv,t1_fc5u2cu,1577470556.0,"To be fair, a guy I went to high school with started working in a factory at 18, at 22 he became a team lead, and is now a manager making over 120k at 36 with full benefits.  In the other hand, many people who went to college are still hovering at 50-60k.  Others didn't ever advance and are still living at home working multiple part time jobs and making under 35k with no benefits. 

There is nothing wrong with working your way up from the bottom, and no job is worthless if you strive to do better for yourself. 

All that said, I support universal healthcare because I also know people stuck in their job because they can't afford to switch and do the months of cobra.  They can't open their own business because their kids need continuing healthcare and they can't afford to pay out of pocket, and others live in constant fear if getting sick because their deductibles are several thousand and they have no savings to cover a major illness or injury.  We need healthcare reform, but not because there is something shameful about working a factory job."

Every single girl who was a friend, classmate, on a team with me, or who I met through another friend they always pestered me with the ""oh, it's a giiirl huh?  Do you like her? Is she single? Is she pretty?""  I ended up not introducing them to any girl I dated after high school, not that it stopped them from asking.  Every call was ""so are you seeing anyone special""?  I lied, even if I was in bed next to someone I told them no.  Eventually I stopped calling them as much because I didn't want to hear it.  I never told them about another girl I was dating until I was ready to pop the question to my wife.

I have made it a point to not do the same with my kids, my daughter mentioned a boy to me the other day and I get it now, a little in that I want to know if this is a boy she ""like-likes"", because if it is a boyfriend then I want to know that about her life, but I don't want to pry or embarrass her either because I know how it felt, and I want her to feel free to bring it up on her own.  With my son, I do the same because I also want him to know that it's okay to be friends with a girl, even an attractive girl, and not want to date her or screw her."

But yeah, you can relentlessly pester and use psychological hard sell techniques to convince an 18 year old girl who is in bad shape financially to have degrading painful sex on camera with multiple people and it's perfectly legal, but if you let her have a beer at the post show wrap party then you can go to jail."

And then, the age is 26.  If you're 18 and graduate high school and can't find yourself a full-time gig with benefits in 8 years then it's because you didn't make it a priority.

If you went to college for 4 years then you then have 4 years to find a position and a lot more ability to find a position with benefits.

If you can't find work, can't work, or are working a minimum wage position then you probably qualify for medicare or free insurance through the healthcare exchange.\\

The real thing to worry about is what will happen if you change jobs, have a 90 day waiting period for insurance at the new job, and during that 90 days you get into a horrible accident."
