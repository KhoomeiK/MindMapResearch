And to repurpose the term suffrage fully knowing its sounds like suffering is a clear sign of the subterfuge. It was a greater plan that the Girl Code would ensure women would inexorably take over politics due to natural ingroup preference. Women are powerful, but only at all agreeing with each other, which translates to all voting together. Which translates to legislating in favor of women. And now its 2020."
