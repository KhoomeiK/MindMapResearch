TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffdm5c6,t1_ffcm5rm,1579823816.0,"She definitely is. 

It was exhausting just associating with her and hearing all the stupid shit happening. That's what I feel like Kail's life must be like."
TrueOffMyChest,ffbs89e,t3_esqc0a,1579780762.0,"It's hard losing a pet, especially when they become your baby. I lost my ferret in june and was wrecked over it for a long time. 

Love up on the other kitty and maybe down the road you can find a nice shelter animal and save their life to honor your kitty."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffbr290,t3_esocka,1579779348.0,"Girl, I really hope you've got your own form of BC. Don't trust the sperminator or that will change."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffbqs5j,t1_ffbo1t8,1579778988.0,"Ske reminds me of someone I know who was in a somewhat similar situation. 

Knew the guy was with someone else, proceeded to pursue him. Got pregnant and miscarried, the other woman found out and started harassing her. Continued to persue him, got pregnant again 4 months after the other woman got pregnant. Other woman is now heavily pregnant and busts into her apartment in the middle of the night to beat the shit out of her. Guy still stays with other woman and doesn't show interest in the second kid. She continues to persue him and after a couple years somehow does actually get him to be with her now. Multiple years later agrees to get married and then just fights almost non stop now after being married. Other woman still in picture because of the other kids and makes life hell too. 

I do not know why some people make their life so complicated."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffbqfd7,t1_ffbhf3s,1579778522.0,"Oh good God. Sorry you're going through that, that's ridiculous! 

Happy cake day."
depressionregimens,ffb0c09,t3_esmx7u,1579748662.0,"My heart rate was higher when I was on it and i sweat a lot. I have anxiety though so sometimes that ramps my heart rate up, but it seemed I consistently had an HR in the upper 90s to low 100s and my blood pressure was elevated. 

I've been off for 6 months now and that's all dropped back down again. If you're running at over 100 beats a minute you should call your doctors office and tell them. If it's not that high then maybe give it a few more days to see if you adjust and then call."
aww,ffazdh2,t3_esmeab,1579748014.0,"Yep. My two are definitely lap cats, they enjoy nothing more than snoozing on us and being pet. I suppose they do equally enjoy their treats too but that's another subject."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffaowob,t1_ffalk9n,1579741050.0,That's what I thought too. Like a dog peeing on things to mark their territory.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffakrt1,t1_ffahjcv,1579738212.0,"They don't show the worst of the animal abuse but they definitely show some of it. If you can handle that, then yes. 

Its fucking insane. Those people make the TM hatters look like amateur newbs with their sleuthing."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffaf9u7,t1_ffabgag,1579734364.0,Agreed. I think he loves that she's easy to control and she's got a good cash flow coming in.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffaf88e,t1_ffaeuqe,1579734332.0,I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you get to feeling better soon! And happy cake day!
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffaf2y4,t1_ffa4gd1,1579734222.0,"I'll look into that, thanks! 

I was on a lot of heavy meds but it had me feeling numb and doped up 24/7 so when I was informed my psychiatrist was no longer practicing I decided that was my sign to taper off. I gained so much weight being on that stuff and it didnt do anything other than numb me to life in general so I'd rather not go back on it if I can help it. I'm not anti meds, it just didnt work for me and I'm really hesitant to try again."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffaeomr,t1_ffaa3md,1579733912.0,"I still have some seriously bad flashbacks due to that show. Ugh. It was so scaring for me. 

Imma go hug my kitties (one who's currently obnoxiously howling at the door at the moment.)"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffaek6u,t1_ffaeh9b,1579733812.0,Jenelle has done her fair share of animal abuse. She just may not have used a gun to do it.
antiMLM,ffa0706,t3_esgkxl,1579725230.0,I don't even paint my nails and I can tell you that looks horrid.
aww,ff9zsqn,t3_esh9s5,1579724997.0,Oh. Its *you*.
aww,ff9z4fd,t3_eshc25,1579724604.0,"Give it back!

Edit. I meant this to sound like the dog whining but instead it sounds like an internet stranger being pushy. Sorry."
interestingasfuck,ff9yp5h,t1_ff9qbl2,1579724354.0,I had mine for 10 months and there was nowhere near as much work involved straightening mine out. Had to be either a couple years or they were a lot more aggressive with them than mine was. If the latter is the case that would have to have been absolutely excruciating.
oddlysatisfying,ff9y8ej,t3_eshdro,1579724082.0,I just had one front tooth that was set back behind two others and the pain of moving the two out of the way to pull it forward was bad enough. My mouth hurt watching this.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff9vekr,t3_esfppg,1579722335.0,"I don't see it happening. If he was still trying to sign the rights away to Lux last fall it would take a lot to change his opinion of being a father. It seems pretty screwed up that Lux is old enough to at least recognize Chris as his father, they've spent a decent amount of time together, and Chris still tried to sign him away. 

There's no way I could see Chris taking on 4 kids if he couldn't handle/didn't want his first one. They're both absolutely stupid to keep playing this game and then end up with another kid too."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff9rfto,t1_ff9p48y,1579719471.0,"Its tragic because a mother of 3 is never truly alone. Imagine all the snuggles she could get if she let them. The games she could play with them. Laughs at movies and memories in general made. Instead she throws it away for a pitiful excuse of a man who puts her down, makes life miserable, and loves the power over her more than he loves her. 

I get that a relationship with kids isnt near the same as one with other adults but those kids have so much love to give and she just throws it away because it's not enough for her. I don't even want my own kids and looking at that situation breaks my heart."
TrueOffMyChest,ff9qua8,t3_ese8ym,1579718997.0,"I wish she would just disappear, she makes anything she involves herself in worse."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff9koiz,t1_ff9jhwm,1579715030.0,Take my sad/reluctant upvote for that one.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff9k1br,t3_esepa3,1579714652.0,Does she have makeup on or is it the filter making her eyes look so dark? It's a cute picture aside from that.
UnsentLetters,ff9i4ck,t3_esekv6,1579713507.0,Sounds like your workplace needs a poop knife.
trashy,ff9hu6o,t3_esemfw,1579713334.0,In a Ford? Good luck with that.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff9fkfa,t1_ff95oek,1579711946.0,"You're right, I wasnt trying to say everyone but I see its come out that way."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff9fex3,t1_ff9a8gv,1579711853.0,"I actually just called to set up an appointment because I can't control my anxiety attacks right now. No availability for appointments for a solid 3 weeks but ""if it's bad enough [I] could try the ER."" 

And then you add the health insurance issue on top of it and that's a whole other level."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff949l9,t1_ff90rt7,1579704481.0,"If only he put the time he spends chasing random internet comments down into being a parent. 

I think you're right."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff8zwqw,t1_ff8r0q0,1579701254.0,"It sounds like he threatened to kill himself so she probably didn't want to leave him alone for fear he'd do it. 

Which is classic abusive gaslighting behavior. When I was engaged the guy would pull that shit on me too. It paralyzes people because you don't know what to do when you hear someone say that so all rational thought goes out the window."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff8zfi7,t1_ff8z8h6,1579700877.0,"He procreated with Jenelle so that's already a level of mental illness in itself. 

But yeah, he's not okay. The drinking might be aggravating the TBI."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff85gxt,t3_es5c8k,1579666522.0,"I always forget about her and then when I see her name I remember ""that's the stillbirth faker"" and get too annoyed to look further at whatever she posted."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff850zi,t3_es5pwy,1579666173.0,"I'm just going to wait for the sleuths to figure out who bailed him out. I actually wouldn't be surprised if it was someone other than Kail, this guy seems to have a lot of connections."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff84hzp,t3_es5t5t,1579665766.0,"I think it's fair to want some things to stay private but I have two caveats to that. 

1: don't put things on your SM that would allude to the situation and expect attention for it but also claim you want it to stay private. 

2: they're on a show that's whole premise was supposed to be about the hardships of a teenage pregnancy and encouraging teens/young adults to prevent it. Yes that ship has sailed but there are still ads played though it advertising safe sex. By continuing to be on that show they're continuing to be associated with that message. It should be absolutely no surprise when a pregnancy rumor flies like Kail's and people are bothered by it. And I'll take the heat for this, but I think when they put themselves in that position they should have to answer for it. If this was any other reality TV show I'd agree they have the right to not talk about a pregnancy, but not this one. Its spiraled so far from it's original message though that it's almost unrecognizable from what it was supposed to be."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff6fikn,t3_erv3tv,1579626079.0,"Right, because moving like 2 hours away from your own child for your soulmate of the week and then having a replacement baby was such a more respectable move. Then you proceeded to do it all over again with a new soulmate. 

I feel bad for how much emotional damage these kids have to recover from because of all their parents. None of them have a better option and Jace's long term success rides on how much Barb realized she messed up with her own kids and changed things with him."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff5t0t0,t3_erq6kd,1579609135.0,"If the way they said things wasn't so cringeworthy I don't know if they'd be getting as much heat. 

Like if she had just said ""stop mocking me for learning Spanish, I want to be able to talk to Royer"" I think most people would've instantly dropped it. 

Instead she bumblefucks around and insinuates a biracial kid will immediately have a language barrier at birth and uses spanglish to make herself feel justified. 

Makes me wonder if in their google translations they've figured out yet that spanish has different dialects depending on region and sometimes one spanish speaker will struggle to understand the verbiage of another."
TrueOffMyChest,ff4wwqz,t3_erls9z,1579574405.0,Find the unique subreddits and that's less common. One of my favorite subs is a trashy reality TV sub because that doesn't come up much there-- if it does it seems to get shot down pretty quick. There's still places to escape it but you have to look for them.
TrueOffMyChest,ff4wi4j,t3_ermgzx,1579574124.0,"My sister and I are 6 years apart and we hated each other until my mom died and we had to band together. Honestly, if my mom hadn't died and life went nuts, I don't know if we'd be as close. I ended up raising her so we had to just get over it. 

That's just the hard part about siblings being spaced out in age. Maybe as you both age you'll find common ground."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff3ujxj,t3_eric4y,1579549163.0,"Who knows. Shit is so crazy at this point, we may never know until a baby mysteriously appears."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff2us4v,t3_erby7g,1579524983.0,"Interestingly enough, Jenelle, YOU'VE never made it about your child either so that literally puts you in the same light as Nathan. 

Its bullshit that Kai's only shot at life rides on if his 60-70something year old grandma can take care of him and her seriously ill (or disabled, I can't remember) husband. 

Both of you buffoons failed him. ***BOTH.***"
