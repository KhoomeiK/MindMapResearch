If you compare a 19"" 480p tube TV today to one from 40 years ago I'm sure it would be a lot cheaper (if they were even made, which they aren't, because everything today is giant 4k panels with complex firmware facilitating all kinds of connectivity).

Understand that loading times are only partly due to reading data from the HDD... there are a lot of other things being done during that time including pre-computing shaders and other in-RAM optimization of data. Also understand that SSD's have a MUCH larger advantage in writing data than they do in reading it and game load times are affected by reading, not writing. Also understand that even if the SSD cuts the load time to 25% (which would be better than reality according to my own observations) that's still pretty insignificant compared to the total time playing the game. Consider a loading screen takes 30 seconds on an HDD, 20 of which is actually loading data, and the SSD drops that to 5 seconds of loading and thus 15 total seconds on the loading screen... okay, I saved 15 seconds and then I played the game for 3600 seconds... So the amount of time saved is like half a percent of the total time spent in the game.

SSD's CAN speed up the OS quite a bit, as everyone is saying, but the affect is more apparent to people with poorly optimized systems with a bunch of shit running in the background (which describes 99.9% of PC users). People like me who HATE having stuff running in the background and know enough to know which things can be disabled don't see as much of a benefit. This is because the SSD boost for the OS has a LOT more to do with latency than it does with throughput (your OS isn't writing or reading that much at any given time, but 100 different background processes might be trying to write a few bytes each to their log files every damn second...)"

I agree with everything being said here: It's all calories, it's physics, a Calorie is a unit of measure that measures metabolic energy, your body uses so much energy each day and if you eat more than that your body will store the excess in your fat cells, if you eat less than your body needs it will make up that difference by using stored energy in your fat cells. Fat cells inflate and deflate like balloons... To lose significant fat you must consume less energy than your body uses each day for a prolonged period of time (months or even years).

A pound of fat has ~3500 calories. If you eat 500 calories per day less than the amount of energy your body uses each day (called your TDEE) then you will lose 1 pound of fat per week because 7 * 500 = 3500."

It's really very simple... there is nothing new about accused people being let free, that has always happened, and they have sometimes committed crimes after being let free. You are only hearing about these things now because of this new law. It is bias, perpetrated intentionally by the media, which is also known as propaganda.

The bail system as it used to exist was discriminatory against poor people. There was little, if any, effort made to scale bail amounts to financial status of the accused. This meant that wealthy people were effectively immune to it entirely while poor people were burdened by it. That is is not a good thing... and we were right to end it."

People need to know they are doing something wrong in order to change. It feels good to overeat and to eat junk food, that needs to be countered with feeling equally bad about it. How else do you expect anyone to willfully deprive themselves of something that is so enjoyable? There needs to be a counterbalance, and in that counterbalance you and I and everyone else here find our ability to resist overindulging.

Agreed, I had the same experience. I really liked keto at first, it made me feel better than I had in a long time. I've realized since then though that the shitty feeling comes from simple carbs in junk food... you can eat complex carbs in reasonable portions and not have those affects.

If you're doing keto like I was (measuring your pee with diabetes test strips to make sure you're staying in ketosis) then I think you should relax a bit with that, it's not very good for you to stay in ketosis. It absolutely ""works"", the science is sound, it makes your body burn fat for fuel instead of carbs... however that does not mean you lose more weight, your weight lost/gained is still 100% due to caloric balance with your activity and BMR. You lose weight just because it's really fucking hard to eat like that!

I follow what I consider to be a ""low"" carb diet... but ""low"" is relative. Compared to most people it's low, compared to what I used to eat when I was fat it was low... now I just think of it as normal healthy eating though, and I'm not sticking strips of paper into my piss stream anymore"

Also keto is just a trick to lose weight, it tricks you into eating less calories. I used to do it and it worked, but it didn't work because of any weird macro split, it worked because I ate less overall. I feel like I've outgrown that in my knowledge and my willpower and can now lose, maintain, or gain weight without any such tricks.

I used to be fat, you know what finally woke me up and got me to lose all the weight? Browsing the old ""fatpeoplehate"" subreddit before it was banned. Before that friends and family would tell me ""you're not fat!""... I was obese according to the BMI. 4 years later I am now 160lbs and muscular and have been going to the gym 5 days a week for the last 3 years.

Most people do not find obesity attractive, and that is biological. We are evolutionarily programmed to find health and youth attractive, because healthy and young individuals are statistically more likely to produce healthy offspring that survive. Finding obesity attractive is an aberration, there is no plausible evolutionary benefit to creating offspring with an obese person, and that is what drives sexual attraction.

There are obviously genetic differences that exist between different groups of people depending on their lineage and these differences are the result of the process of allopatric speciation, namely geographic isolation induced differential selection pressure and differential random mutations. We were separated into populations that never interbred for long enough to develop distinctly different traits before we invented methods of travel that bridged those gaps between our populations and lead to resumed interbreeding, which cut the process short before those populations could actually evolve into separate species. We are now in a long process of reunification through interbreeding between those historically isolated populations. If this continues at some point in the future we will all largely look the same with the same skin color and facial features and everything else that currently makes those groups distinct."

I wonder if it would be a cheaper option to give them house arrest with a police chaperone... You'd need to hire more LEO but that might be cheaper than more judges and court staff and buildings. Then you have the issue of the very real detrimental effects of house arrest on the accused... as it is they would likely lose their jobs and that can't be allowed to happen if they are innocent so we have to solve that problem... mandating employers hold their job open for them is a burden on employers so I don't think that's a good idea. Maybe we could allow them to continue to work with a police escort, not necessarily at their job but on the commute to/from to make sure they only go there and then only return home after.

Any solution will cost more money and that's why no one wants to do it... because they care less about the rights of the accused than they do about saving a few dollars a year in taxes (you can see just from this discussion how most people automatically assume accused people are guilty... which is honestly fucking scary if this is the way our society is going, we are primed for a very dystopian future like this)."
