relationships,fdpl8ov,t1_fdpkzgr,1578631744.0,My issue with that is that you are comparing someone with little to no responsibilities to someone who now does. The age at the point doesn't matter because for whatever reason they (both parents involved) chose to keep this child.

I completely disagree. He is definitely overreacting but this is a silly comparison. When someone becomes a parent they accept a list of responsibilites that come with it, and its pretty fair (especially with the breast feeding point) that he wouldn't like it if the mother of his child goes off, does drugs, drink all the time. Now this doesn't mean that you have to stay at home every night for the rest of your life, there is a middle ground that they need to hit on but she needs to remember ""oh yeah, I have a baby at home"" when she makes certain decisions."

He gave a weight he put on and you told him ""no you weren't eating that little"", ""no half of that is factors I have no idea that defintely played in your gain"", ""no you didn't put that much on whats so hard to understand."" We don't know this person and yet you are claiming things as if you have some confidential knowledge of his physiology for this period, his diet and his routine.

For the third time I will reiterate this  He  didn't claim he gained 30lbs of muscle and if we assume he regularly  weighed, followed a routine (that we have no way to know he didn't)  and each week he gained weight, he gained it, simple as that. Arguing that half it is water or food or factors we have no idea how/if they played a role on some anorexic weight gain is pointless."

>But again, its pointless argument. He  didn't claim he gained 30lbs or muscle and if we assume he regularly  weighed, followed a routine (that we have no way to know he didn't) and  each week he gained weight, he gained it, simple as that.

You are actually gatekeeping weight gaining and telling him he didn't put on weight."
gainit,fcitt21,t1_fcisvvq,1577669644.0,"People who start diets and lose 10lbs in one week of water are usually the people that are at 250+lbs and don't drink enough water, don't exercise at all and more factors. They aren't losing all that weight because they cut one portion of potatoes. They are drinking more, exercising and hopefully eating some less carbs. All those things LOWER water weight and most of it are active parts of people gaining or losing.  You won't suddenly gain 10lbs of water while doing the same activities because you ate two portions more of potatoes.

But again, its pointless argument. He didn't claim he gained 30lbs or muscle and if we assume he regularly weighed, followed a routine (that we have no way to know he didn't) and each week he gained weight, he gained it, simple as that."
gainit,fcismkr,t1_fcis5dk,1577668844.0,"And imo you are highly overestimating but it doesn't matter regardless. Like I said, if he weighed repeatedly week to week and each week it said ""22, 24, 26, 28"" etc. And each week he had the same routine of how, when, what he ate etc he still gained 30lbs. Your argument is almost that as if he claimed it was all muscle or something, which he isn't. But to say ""no 15lbs is water and food in your stomach"" is so laughable, no, it won't be."
gainit,fcirwpc,t1_fcir0ck,1577668369.0,"If we take what he originally says he was averaging it absolutely makes sense. You say its impossible becuase the BMR is usually much higher for someone of his stature, but that also implies pretty precise knowledge of his body, his eating habits prior, his weight prior etc.

Just because its an outlier doesn't make it untrue, it means that we probably don't know every variable of his weight gain . 

But from the stats given, 6'4 dude, was at a135lbs, found that he ate about 1100 calories average, then started eating 2200, that is almost the exact 1160 surplus you say he would need to achieve what he said he did.

Look, either he is lying and decided to google tde calculators as you did to bring legitimacy to his claim or he is telling the truth, I think its closer to being true than you just shitting on him telling him he had a large meal before he weighed."
gainit,fciqlv8,t1_fciluu2,1577667479.0,"You should probably take your own advice considering from the sounds of it you really don't know shit. 30lbs over three months is about 2.5lbs a week which is absolutely achievable, especially if we allow for fat gains (no one ever only puts mucle on and if thats a part of your argument, its dumb as fuck) and that he was basically near/was anorexic.

You don't know his body, how he has gained what he did or does now look like etc so I don't know why you keep trying to tell him ""no you just had a full meal in your stomach when you weighed"".  Week by week if he weighed and he averaged around 30lbs gained or more during his bulk, regardless of water or breakfast or whatever, he gained that much, its not hard to understand."

Myfitnesspal,fcgx5cz,t1_fcg6twt,1577644956.0,"Well the last ten days would also include all the extra you have been eating/drinking over the holidays right? So it may not be a correct estimation for what you eat week to week, month to month. Because yeah, at 2200 at your stats you would be putting on a lot more weight week to week unless you are not accounting exercise or you occasionally heavily undereat."
