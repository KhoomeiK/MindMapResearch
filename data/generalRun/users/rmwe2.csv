In 1790 there was no wild disparities like exist between say, California with 40,000,000 residents and Wyoming with 577,000. California has 69 Americans for every American Wyoming has.

In 1790, the *entire US* had just 3.9 million people. The biggest state was Virginia, with 747,610 people (39% of whom were enslaved) and the smallest was Delaware with 59,094. The largest non-Slave State was Massachusetts with 398,000 (apx). So, even counting slaves, the biggest difference in # of Americans was one State having 12 Americans for every one in the smallest.

We've already changed both how the House and Senate function in order to accommodate population, expansion of suffrage and elimination of slavery (House capped its membership, part of the big problem with disproportionate representation in the EC, and the Senate now takes elected rather than Governor appointed Senators). 

We never bothered with the EC mostly because it only opposed the popular will *once* before in 1888. Except this century, its already done so twice --- both times in favor of very rural isolated voters that have this outsized structural advantage that just didn't exist in 1790."

worldnews,fg5okgu,t1_fg59uld,1580533411.0,"I appreciate the good will, very rare between Trump supporters and everyone else these days. Let me try and address all your points:

>one political party to undo an election.

Thats one of the weirdest arguments I see regularly from Trump supporters. Impeachment exists in our Constitution to remove unfit Presidents. It absolutely does not undue an election. If Trump were to be removed (and clearly I think he should be, he is a hazard to our republic imo) *Pence* would be President. Not Clinton. I think Pence would be a *bad* President and would vote against him (as I did in Bushes second term after voting for him in the first), but I wouldn't advocate for his impeachment. In any case, Trump would still be our 45th President, would still have signed into law his laws, would still have appointed his judges, would still have signed his treaties and would still have signed his executive orders. The election is not undone.

>This entire Presidency has been bombarded by half-truth fueled accusations and they all have fallen flat. The Mueller Report didn't reveal Russian collusion, so then it was obstruction for awhile.

Thia kind of gets at the central disagreement between Trump supporters and everyone else that I've seen.

The Muller Report very plainly laid out how Russia helped the Trump campaign *specifically* and details how the Trump campaign was aware of and welcoming of that help. That by itself is plainly not a crime, but I personally as a citizen am deeply disturbed that the Trump campaign welcomed and didnt report that help. Im deeply disturbed that Trump denies the plain truth that Russia conducted a large and coordinated campaign on his behalf, including hacking into the DNC.

>The Mueller Report didn't reveal Russian collusion, so then it was obstruction for awhile.

The Muller report goes on to outline Trumps obstruction of the investigation. You portray this as if it is somehow an *excuse* rather than itself a deeply disturbing action by the President. Not only does Trump *still* deny the plain truth that Russia interfered on his behalf, he actively hampered the investigation into him.

He is boasting of doing *exactly the same thing* in this Impeachment hearing.

That's the divide: You and other Trump supporters actually cheer on that he is not held accountable and take it as evidence that somehow is treating him unfairly. As if somehow this Billionaire President of the United States who has taken full control of one of our two principal political parties is the *underdog* rather than the single person who holds the largest possible structural advantage over the US legal and political system.

That last part is what I cannot understand about Trump supporters and why ultimately I hold them in disdain. For no other politician would you take their ability to escape justice as proof of their innocence. Either Clinton for example: many investigations, no proof, no convictions, nothing. Do you gloat about that? Does that make you proud? Do you go get in online arguments about it and defend them? Why do you do those things for Trump?"

The Senate is run by Mitch McConnel who made it very plainly clear that he did not intend to do anything but acquit the President and literally said he would not consider any evidence. He is the one who pushed to block the Senate from calling any witnesses or subpoenaing any additional evidence.

The President and his agents like to loudly and often lie that there is no evidence. They have told very specific and plain lies you can also verify yourself (for example Trump claimed not to know the Ukrainian criminal Lev Parnas, a business associate of his own personal attorney, Giuliani. A tape came out showing Trump and Parnas having a conversation about the US ambassador to Ukraine, who Trump agrees to get rid of based on Parnas' say so)."

How do you not understand yet that we don't have a copy of the actual call, but rather an explicitly non-verbatim memo of it? Even that shows Trump tying military aid to this favor.

Second, Trump refuses to face anyone. He will not appear under oath or otherwise.
