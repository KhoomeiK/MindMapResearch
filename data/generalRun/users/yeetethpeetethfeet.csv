fatlogic,ffd4rzw,t3_esz8vz,1579813409.0,"Yo-yo dieting is terrible for you. Having listened to a lot of fatlogic from my friends and family, I do believe that a lot of HAES people have been exploited and used by the diet industry in the literal sense, trying completely unsustainable diets (grapefruit diet for example) only to then ""relapse"" into weight gain. The basic principle that a diet should be *for life*, and must therefore incorporate foods that the person enjoys eating, seems to have been lost.

HAES and fatlogic are easy to fall into. If all you do is fail at diets, and know nothing about nutrition, it becomes a ""logical"" viewpoint. Education and help is needed."

But, in terms of width anyway, you need to be very overweight to actually fail to sit in one. Aircraft seats are designed to still be safe for the vast majority of passengers- that includes people who are large, since most of the population is overweight or obese.

The last time I checked, you would need a waist in excess of 42 inches to start ""rubbing"" the sides of the chair in an unsafe way. That's a large waist size, and honestly, you have more to worry about at that point than aircraft seats."

fatlogic,fduz45n,t3_en5bsw,1578741204.0,"1- Diets don't fail, people fail. This is probably the most important point. If you eat 1,700 calories a day and burn 1,800, you will lose weight. If you eat 3000 calories and burn 2800, you will slowly gain. The ""diet"" never fails, the basic principles of physics and chemistry don't fail. You fail, and that is something which can be avoided. 

2-  In fairness, she could have been badly advised here, but the basic point isn't really true. Of course you treat the patient for their health concerns, but losing weight is often an integral part of treating those conditions. Someone with an eating disorder of course needs treatment for the disorder, but their physical health and not to mention mental health will be helped with dietary changed in many cases. 

3- Having a fat body is a health concern, so the natural response of most doctors when encountering one is to suggest weight loss. Hurting yourself on an intense hike is more likely when you're overweight, UTI's are more common in severely obese people. Acne and depression can also be aided by dietary changes. No doctor with their salt encounters a severely Ill woman with a UTI and just ""tells them to lose weight"", but a sensible doctor would prescribe weight loss and immediate treatment 

4- indeed, If someone is a healthy weight and body composition, then it isn't the best recommendation. Nor does Weight loss replace other medical treatment. But if you are overweight and not an extremely fit athlete for whom BMI breaks, your health is being dragged down."

cookingforbeginners,fdqcitq,t3_emncjx,1578662975.0,"1- Get a selection of dried spices. These can be used on almost any dish, add flavour for not much cost, and keep almost forever if stored in a dark place. 

2- Stock up in canned ingredients and long lasting goods at the beginning of the month. That way you don't need to worry as much about getting odd pieces and can just focus on the fresh ingredients.

3- Cook meals out of simple ingredients in large batches, and plan what to do with leftovers. For example, make 3 portions of a Thai Curry on Monday, and use the leftovers on wednesday to make 2 portions of fried rice. Freeze what you cook- it lasts for ages.

4- when your spices, fruit, cake etc is about to go off, freeze some of it, and eat at a later date. 

5- finally- PLAN YOUR SHOPPING. Think at the beginning of the week what you will *definitely* need, and then think what might be nice to have. Buying things like rice, bread, pasta, tomatoes eventually becomes habit."

Obviously double check by making a drier marinade- if it still waters up, you'll know it's the beef. 

If it is the beef, cooking at a very high temperature and quickly stirring ingredients around the pan can help, as it will get rid off the moisture quickly. Other than that, low quality beef and chicken (especially mince) can sweat."

If you want tips on how to make the most out of your ingredients, I'd suggest these:

Buy things with the longest sell by date. Sounds obvious, but a lot of times people forget. Even a day or two extra could give you a chance to use it.

Find recipes which work with slightly stale products- this works really well with fruits such as bananas. The ""sell by date"" or ""best before date"" can usually be exceeded if you are, for example, making a banana or apple cake.
