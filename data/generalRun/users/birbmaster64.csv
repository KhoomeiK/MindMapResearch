sadcringe,ffpy2y7,t1_ffpw74s,1580110443.0,"Assuming they've never met it's the best advice you can give. Chatting or texting is very different from face to face conversation. As a teen I used to think that only people who were interesting to talk to online were interesting in reality as well. I quickly learned it can be quite the opposite and some people are too invested in their real life to be bothered by endless online friendships. Then I became such person myself. I dislike texting too long without meeting the person and my limited experience in dating shows that if you text for too long without planning to meet very soon, you'll never gonna meet. /edit: word"
insanepeoplefacebook,ffpmpvk,t3_eubgfi,1580098917.0,Why are people like this.
trashy,ffpmkbg,t3_euc0zl,1580098794.0,This gives me awful memories. 3 years of this bullshit. At least I live alone now.
trashy,ffkzehz,t1_ffje78g,1580031970.0,"You know I agree with you about not your commitment thing. And I can picture a situation when you hook up with someone not caring about their marital status. It's their responsibility after all. I don't know where and when I would draw a line but for sure actively purchasing relationship with a taken person is trashy for me. Don't know the circumstances in this case tho.
I'm not monogamous myself but I like all things clear and open. I also wouldn't want to be involved with someone who cheats on their significant other... Way to get yourself into unnecessary drama. Also, they don't care about their spouse, they care even less about you.
I have a friend who was very much in love with a married man few years older than herself. An affair lasted 2 years. She was isolated from social life cause they had common friends and she had to hide so couldn't attent any parties if he was around. She lost them all. Then he dumped her but didn't came back to his wife either, he left his wife too. Nowadays dude has a new family and kids in different city, my friend is not so lucky. He destroyed her. Don' know about his ex wife."

/edit I think I should clarify life damaged by drugs, not a hiv status. Nowadays being hiv positive is nothing like it used to be in the past"

aww,ffiua93,t1_ffiqs6c,1579982889.0,Haha I was planning to use this account mostly on bird subreddits but got sucked into many different communities.
aww,ffio3r5,t1_ffini7p,1579978526.0,"Can confirm, when you say ""no"" loudly they give you a silly look. If you get angry with their behaviour they start annoying you for fun. I guess when you are flighted that attitude is understandable. You can escape any moment and laugh and shit at everything from above."
aww,ffimcqs,t1_ffijjoz,1579977321.0,"Yeah, parrots can be potty trained, don't know about other birds. Parrots poop in certain position so you see they're about to do their business.  They poop consciously and are smart but simply don't care. Some are cleaner than others tho, I have one bird that always moves away to avoid shitting on me or his perch or bed or whatever he's currently sitting on. Meanwhile his girlfriend poops into her own food. 
With smaller birds potty training is problematic cause they move around and poop a lot and it's hard to pick them up and place at certain spot everytime they're about to poop.
With bigger birds it's easier but you have to be careful to not give them impression they are allowed to defecate only on command or something. Parrots are hella smart and can wait for their owner to come which can hurt them, that's what I've read somewhere."

trashy,ffej1ob,t1_ffefcru,1579850024.0,I think it's maybe a coping mechanism to avoid dealing with consequences of your husband being this nasty to you. Instead of blaming the person you love they choose the less devastating option (for them) and the other woman gets all the hate. I'd like to see if there's any connection between this and staying in relationship with a cheater.
trashy,ffdp1xl,t1_ffdmdx5,1579825594.0,Or at least in separation or getting a divorce or something.
trashy,ffd7aq2,t1_ffcd2ts,1579814812.0,"It always baffles me that it's not a cheater who gets most of hate. I mean it's trashy to sleep with a married man but come on, she is not the one who promised you to be faithful."

IncelTears,femr9lp,t1_femo72c,1579267315.0,"What saddens me is countless number of young boys that fell into that dark hole full of potential sociopathic predators and believed it's over for them cause they are virgin at the age of 16 and have bad acne. It's always young frustrated boys getting deluded by a promise of power, aren't they? In all armies of totalitarian world, in all terrorist groups and many cults. And that power requires degrading women, always. It's always  hatred towards women and feminity. It always uses very primitive physiological urges. Vile."
facepalm,femqfzo,t3_epwmlf,1579266588.0,Edgy troll I believe. Still hope he sees it in the future and cringe hard at himself.
trashy,fek0qz2,t3_epgz2n,1579190136.0,I feel like nothing triggers me anymore but here we are. I've read about some truly vile things... but this shit. Ugh. It's like my brain doesn't even accept it's real.

AskReddit,fdddaiw,t1_fdcsdyk,1578306803.0,Yeah but it was probably the first time I felt completely puzzled why is it a thing. I disliked Snapchat too but at least it wasn't that alien. Tic toc made me realize that eh maybe I'm kinda old now and don't want to understand something. Scary!
AskReddit,fdbxgtw,t1_fda5zs8,1578263472.0,I'm a millennial (one of the youngest) but tic toc makes me feel like a boomer. I don't get the appeal of it and would hate to even try.
