fatlogic,ffxro2e,t1_ffxcoq9,1580331081.0,"I don't *say* ""no fats"" on my profile.  It's pretty dumb to load your profile with a bunch of negatives.  Talk about what you do like in a partner, or your own hobbies and good traits. It's easy enough to weed out the people you aren't attracted to without half your profile being a list of things you don't want.

It's not like someone's going to look at your profile and say, ""I was going to swipe right on her, but she said 'no flakes or mind games' and I'm totally flaky, so I won't waste her time."""
fatlogic,ffrcj3w,t1_ffdziaw,1580155234.0,I wouldn't call that a reputable source.  And I hope they called out for their BS.

badwomensanatomy,ffrc32x,t3_eulm6f,1580154962.0,">She asked what was wrong so I told her I usually don't like to fuck on the first date and I felt as if we should wait a bit more.  She bought it and I internally let our the biggest sigh of relief I ever have in my life.

Why the sigh of relief?  What would have happened if she hadn't ""bought it?""  Would you have been legally obligated to have sex with her?"
fatlogic,ffdsx8i,t3_esnqnk,1579828119.0,"Show me one claim.  One claim.  From a reputable source.  That says a BMI over 20 is too high unless you're very muscular.  

I'll wait."

loseit,fepb134,t3_eq4f8x,1579316167.0,"Here is how I deal with bulk food.

*Create a recipe in the recipe tab of MFP (i.e. for carrot ginger soup - 1lb carrots, 1T fresh ginger, 100g onion, 1T olive oil etc. makes 4 servings)

*Cook the soup

*Put the storage container I'm using for the soup on my scale.  Zero out the scale

*Pour all the soup into the container.  See how many grams (or ounces) it is.

*Calculate how many grams (or ounces) is one serving.  (If the entire recipe comes out to 800 grams of soup, then one serving is 200 grams)

*Write on the lid of your storage container ""200g."" with a dry erase marker, so you remember how much to scoop out for each meal

*Mark it as one meal in MFP.  If you entered the recipe and how many servings, it will calculate for you how much of each macro is in a serving.

It doesn't take as long as it sounds.  I've been doing it for so long, I don't even notice anymore."

fatlogic,fe4h1sd,t3_enqy84,1578859202.0,Alcoholics like me can be denied liver transplant surgery based on arbitrary BAL limits.  Almost like medical professionals are alcoholphobic.

badwomensanatomy,fd7dlm3,t1_fd6lypa,1578202824.0,"I agree with you, but it looks like the boobs themselves might be distorting the lines of the dress.  I'm an owner of big boobs, and they do that to tight clothes.  It's especially noticeable when the clothes are ribbed, as they are in this case.

I mean, it's obviously a ridiculously awful photoshop, but that part might actually be real."

fatlogic,fcy9wmo,t1_fcvzowo,1578076837.0,Thank you.

fatlogic,fcvs2k2,t3_ej6554,1578008826.0,"Nobody rewarded me for weight loss.  In fact, FAs have done such a great job at making everyone feel guilty, nobody even mentions the fact that I went from BMI 36 to 27 in two years.  
I did it anyway.  I'm still doing it.
Although, I must say, I AM being rewarded.  By being able to run around and jump and climb fences and hike and swim and roller skate without getting winded immediately.  By being able to find clothes that show off how hot my body is now.  By saving money on groceries and eating out.  I can go on..."
