EU trucks don't have these problems.  They can actually see where they're driving.  Which, as you can imagine, is a huge safety improvement in a city filled with people walking around everywhere."
virtualreality,fdlep72,t1_fdk26jc,1578522420.0,Interesting point.  Perhaps the best way to handle a racing game would be full 360 degree rotation with just a little bit of incline/decline to handle hills or simulate acceleration/deceleration.

Really sucks that our city infrastructure forces us into making these decisions at all.  You don't see this choice nearly as much in, say, Amsterdam."

So if you're making pants and the one at the top of the stack is a 32/30, one at the bottom might end up being sold as a 31.8/30.5, who knows. Yeah, you'll have fractional sizes. And inventory becomes more around ranges."
NYCbike,fczjb65,t1_fczg1a2,1578102484.0,"There are plenty of intersections you can go to in Manhattan and file *multiple* T&LC complaints every light cycle for T&LC-plated vehicles blocking crosswalks or blocking the intersection.  All it takes is the 311 app.

If it's so damn easy for any random citizen volunteer, why in the hell aren't the traffic cops and regular cops doing their damn jobs?  People speed, run red lights, park illegally, and block crosswalks and intersections *constantly*, and almost nothing ever comes of it.

If it's asking too much for the cops to do their damn jobs, then we should undertake the alternatives of getting rid of as many of these vehicles as possible (by removing travel lanes and adding congestion charges), and we need to add red light and speed cameras up the wazoo everywhere.  They'll pay for themselves in a month.  And then automatically suspend the license plates & registrations of vehicles that rack up too many violations."
NYCbike,fczdaql,t3_ejmrsz,1578098637.0,"There's too many vehicles everywhere going too quickly, and there's insufficient protection for pedestrians and cyclists from them.

The way VisionZero sees success is to drastically reduce the number of vehicles on the road and slow down the ones that remain.  There's a huge number of different actions that need to be taken to accomplish this, but some promising ones that have seen success elsewhere include: converting travel lanes into wider sidewalks, actually protected & separated bike lanes, and busways, eliminating free on-street parking, reducing parking in general, adding commercial loading zones and then *towing* any illegally parked vehicles outside of them, implementing congestion pricing, pedestrianizing foot-traffic-intensive areas entirely (start with Broadway between Columbus Circle and Union Square Park), better enforcement of traffic laws, adding lots of automated red light and speed cameras, the list goes on and on."
