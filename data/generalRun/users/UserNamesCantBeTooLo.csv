politics,fdj6hlj,t1_fdir5tj,1578459804.0,"That scenario failing to happen in a similar situation is how we got here. An attack on American forces by an Iran-backed Shi'ite militia prompted a response by the U.S. (Military leaders presented a menu of options including killing Suleimani, and Trump picked a relatively moderate one instead). Then there were protests and an attack at Baghdad's Green Zone & the embassy that didn't kill or hurt any Americans, and that's when Trump decided he had to assassinate Suleimani.

Maybe your scenario will happen this time, though. I'd guess that Trump's intent is to avoid war, so that he can both ""look tough"" for lashing out, and also look like he's keeping his promises to ""bring our troops home."" Then again, avoiding war may be easier said than done when you open Pandora's box like this."

politics,fd666j2,t1_fczwaax,1578186075.0,"It's more like he's defending Russia than Trump--Trump just happens to benefit from it. He keeps on minimizing Russia's attacks on the U.S.:  “Some Russians wanted to help Trump win the election, and certain people connected to the Trump campaign were receptive to receiving that help. Who the fuck cares about that?” https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/01/glenn-greenwald-russia-investigation.html (Quoted in a very good, nuanced New York Magazine article about Greenwald's stance on the Trump-Russia connection).

Here's the Tucker Carlson segment mentioned in that article:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJszevux0jU

He keeps going on Fox to stress that it hasn't been proven that Donald Trump himself made an explicit agreement to cooperate with Russia's efforts to help him get elected. While ignoring that:

1. [""Since at least March 2016, Russian government cyber actors targeted government entities and multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors.""](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A) (This is a too-often overlooked aspect of Russia's attacks on the US, possibly because it doesn't have anything to do with Trump directly. It's just that *while* they were helping Trump win, they were also hacking critical American infrastructure. Regardless of any partisan considerations, the fact that Russia attacked the business networks around American nuclear power plants, etc. should not be overlooked.)

2. Russia clearly did attack the 2016 US presidential election with a clear preference for helping Donald Trump and attacking his opponent, as assessed not just by US but multiple foreign intelligence services as well.

3. Paul Manafort, who before signing up with Donald Trump, ""[secretly](https://apnews.com/122ae0b5848345faa88108a03de40c5a) worked for a Russian billionaire with a plan to 'greatly benefit the Putin Government,'"" and Donald Trump Jr. accepted a meeting in Trump Tower in June 2016 sold as ""part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump"". President Trump in 2017 [told Trump Jr. what lies to tell](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-dictated-sons-misleading-statement-meeting-russian-lawyer/story?id=48958619) about the meeting, and in 2018 denied knowing about the meeting.

It is entirely possible that, while Russia spent millions to help Trump win, and win he did, those efforts didn't make any difference. It's entirely possible that while Trump was probably open to the help, and he's been strangely submissive to Putin ever since, he didn't do anything technically illegal.

But why, apart from defending Trump, would anyone focus so doggedly and exclusively on the least damning aspects of the story?

To quote the article I mentioned at the beginning:

> To listen to intelligence veterans, there is also a defensive aspect to Greenwald’s collusion skepticism. “You really cannot dismiss as part of his motivation the way in which this new story is undermining the very things that he made his reputation on,” says cybersecurity expert Stewart Baker, a former NSA general counsel. “Which is: embracing WikiLeaks and Snowden and a hostility to the idea that there are national-security threats the U.S. has to respond to.”

> Journalistically, the problem with this dynamic is there’s virtually no revelation in the Russia story that could get Greenwald to change his mind. Which means that while Scahill and other Intercept colleagues tend to evaluate each new revelation at face value, Greenwald focuses disproportionately on debunked or overblown Russia stories. Ever the lawyer, he curates evidence that suits his argument. More than a year ago, the Washington Post published an erroneous story alleging that Russia had hacked into a U.S. electrical grid in Vermont. Greenwald continues to bring this up. To him, it’s not just a random piece of bad reporting but a crucial exhibit in a case he’s building.

It seems like while Greenwald obviously doesn't like Donald Trump, he does like resisting the American military-industrial-intelligence complex. Both are respectable positions. But he's allowed that second objective to come in the way of being impartial on the Trump-Russia connection."

Reports on science and technology tend to be good news (except for those that delve into the effects of pollution and the extinction crisis, which are pretty sobering topics). The source for OP's article, the New York Times, usually has ""bad news"" on the front page, but is also full of ""good news"" on the inside if you look for it.

The old cliche ""if it bleeds, it leads"" is only true because those are the stories that people are most interested in. News media have a strong built-in incentive to report the most dramatic side of things as quickly as possible. And that's not their fault, it's just the nature of human attention.

Disconnecting from the news is really a bad idea. The best practice is just to keep the aforementioned facts in mind, and always be asking hard questions about what you're reading or watching. Try to put things in historical context."

Shubin's prior book was ""Your Inner Fish"". He's the paleontologist who led the team that discovered [Tiktaalik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiktaalik), the first fossil evidence of vertebrates' transition from sea to land 375 million years ago.

The student then led a nationwide campaign to get the required number of states to pass it. In '92, it became the 27th amendment.
