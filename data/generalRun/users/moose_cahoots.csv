Most of the time, a mutation is ""good"" in sense that the mutated version doesn't help the virus. But sometimes the mutation is ""bad"" and makes the virus treatment resistant or more lethal. Let's say the chance of ""bad mutations"" is one in a million.

So if one person is infected, you have one mutation and a 0.0001% chance\* of a ""bad"" mutation. But if you infect one million people, to there is now a 100% chance of a ""bad"" mutation.

So we really want to stop the spread so it has fewer opportunities to have a ""bad"" mutation.

reactiongifs,ffeoqp7,t1_ffenusy,1579857790.0,"I'm well aware as I am a software engineer who specializes in microservices and cloud computing. I am also aware of the issues around eventual consistency. But if your customer is noticing sync issues, it means you screwed up the implementation.

The reason I point out that the cloud is ""someine else's computer"" is that there is nothing special about cloud computing. If you are doing an on-prem install of a service, you have all the same issues unless you are literally installing it on the **exact** machine the boss is using. Eventual consistency, network outages, uptime, and service discovery are all present. The moment a network becomes part of the equation, it doesn't matter if the server is in your on-prem data center or AWS. The issues are identical. So cloud vs on-prem is a basically a meaningless distinction.

Somehow, hundreds of companies run software on the cloud and provided flawless service. Google, Uber, Facebook, etc... don't have these problems. To blame it on moving to the cloud is lazy. 

Because at the end of the day, whether you deploy it on the cloud or within your own data center, the only difference is who owns the hardware. And software doesn't give a shit about that."

To put this another way: your husband thinks he sees a problem and is trying to engage with his wife to solve it (bad ideas, buy he's trying). You think you see a problem and turn away from your husband to punish him. A relationship only works if you turn **towards** each other when there are problems. And right now, he is the only one doing that.

Also, keep in mind that pregnancy affects the male state of mind too. Expecting father's frequently become more protective and react more strongly to any perceived threat. I myself found myself passionate about buying a gun to protect my house. Once the kid showed up, the instinct vanished. Same thing happened with my second kid.
