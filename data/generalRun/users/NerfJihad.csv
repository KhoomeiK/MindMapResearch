Sometimes those jobs aren't advertised accurately, but they offer you an interview anyway.

Now you have to drive 40 miles for an interview for a job that doesn't pay what it said it did and requires a lot more than you thought.

Now they want you for three bucks less per hour, doing stuff you aren't experienced with, you don't get benefits or overtime, and nobody but your coworkers see you as fully human.

Until you get fired again and rehired for another pay cut doing the same work for basically the same people.

I sat down at the too tall stool at the too tall table, black coffee perched too close to the edge and I didn't hesitate.

I turned, nudging it into my lap with my elbow. I grab it too tightly and the lid bursts off like a water balloon.

At first, I can't tell if it's hot or cold. Bright white pain flooded into my brain and my legs kicked out, knocking over the table and toppling me from the stool. My teeth chip when they click into the shiny, trendy finished concrete floor, chopping into my upper lip and squirting blood in a fan.

I screamed in ecstacy and passed out.

When I woke up, my groin was raw and blistered. Boiled eggs and gray greasy sausage. It looked like it would come off in my hands. They said I was lucky, and the second degree burns shouldn't significantly impair function.

Now that skin is shiny, pink and translucent, like a Thai egg roll. The deep red shrimp and shiitake platter, with a side of grey green mottled thousand year eggs. I'm fucking a styrofoam tub of hot and sour soup in my car in the parking lot of my favorite Chinese restaurant.

Rivers of vinegar and chili pool under my ass, as I slosh the third cup up and down in my lap. You start at the bottom and stab up with a razor, making sure you don't push in too hard. When you push in the first time, it sticks closer to you, feels more special.

The steam has fogged the windows in my car, which is a good thing, because I'm only halfway done. Buried under empty bottles of aloe vera gel and empty gauze pad boxes in the back seat is my salvation.

Sous vide chorizo con huevos with a side of ham and taint gets smeared with the last quarter of a 16oz family size bottle as I layer on the brand name antibacterial gauze pads.

I throw the rank and foul towel into the front seat and bask in the afterglow for a minute, resting my fevered brow against the cold tempered glass when a rattle of fingernails snaps me fully awake. I tongue the scar on my lip and smile, stretching it painfully and spreading the V shaped notch.

""What are you doing?"" She asks in a disgusted tone.

I climb over the center console and pull my keys from the ignition, climbing over the passenger seat headfirst, pushing the box of soup onto the floor and opening the door for her.

""Heroin, get in here before they see you."" I hiss at her.

The towel covers up the wet sound as I drop into the driver's seat and blink in shining, agonizing ecstasy. Her face falls.

""Where's your works?""

""What do you... Oh you really thought I was doing heroin?""

""You're not?""

I thought back at all the times I was late, fell asleep at my desk, fell asleep on lunch, and generally exuded a general feeling of sketchiness.

""No way, dude. I'm insulted.""

""Oh, that sucks. I would suck dick for some H right now.""

She eyed my bulging, padded groin.

""You sure you don't got any?"" She asked in the breathless voice she thinks is subtle.

""No, you blew it. I'm going straight back and narking on you right now. I'll get security to toss your desk in front of everyone, you dumb junkie bitch. Get the hell out of my car.""

She flew into the kind of rage only borderline personality disorder and long term poly drug addiction can produce, eyes foraging through the immediate surroundings for a weapon of opportunity.

""I'm going to tell them I caught you-"" her head whipped towards the back seat and scanned the contents ""-...JACKING OFF!""

My heart stopped. My face betrayed me. Her face twisted like the Grinch as she got her story straight in her head.

""I'm not! I wasn't! It's a medical-""

She was awash in her own endorphin cascade. She didn't even notice my complaints.

""Get OUT!"" I yelled, trying to push past her and open the door. She flails, kicking the box of soup and slapping me.

I withdraw, boxed in with her. She bends, grabs a styrofoam cup in each hand and throws them onto my crotch.

I scream, high and shrill and undignified. My back arches, my eyes roll up, my toes curl, and I deposit another fat dollop.

I'm shaky, pale, and sweaty. I know I'm in shock. My mind reels and my vision constricts. Her face is awash with wild calculation.

""That... That wasn't pain, was it?""

Looking into her gray blue eyes with my bleary, bloodshot brown ones, I said ""No. It wasn't."" And passed out completely."
