Seattle,fgi3lrw,t3_eyhum7,1580803925.0,What is that blue stuff behind the clouds?
cars,fgh8txw,t3_eye2fu,1580779378.0,I have a 2012 Maxima and I want to buy from Nissan again but nothing they have excites me.   I owned a 2005 Altima before that.  I was having this conversation last week that I feel like Nissan is forcing me to bring my business to a different brand.   Their offerings seem like they are cutting their losses in the North American market.
Military,fgg208n,t3_exyjzg,1580752516.0,"There are a lot of design sacrifices made with military gear to have them work in every feasible environment.  I don't need my civilian gear to work in both a desert and the arctic circle.  And it reflects in the aesthetics, targeted performance and price tag.  When people say military grade, I think it barely works everywhere."
todayilearned,fgey93i,t1_fgewzvo,1580714897.0,Oh yeah. All the time.  Sometimes for kicks I will give them a fake name.
todayilearned,fgeth4v,t1_fgera46,1580709406.0,And the bartisitas do not write the names on the coffee cups to prevent foreign agencies from collecting the information from the garbage.
todayilearned,fg76m6k,t1_fg6tei4,1580585218.0,"For future reference to any of those high speed Army trainers telling people that AC in armored vehicles is optional, I have had the unfortunate experience of having the AC in my M1114 uparmored HMMWV go out on a patrol in a high IED threat environment.  Temp was 110+ outside, we were in full battle rattle and cracking the windows would expose us to fragmentation from potential IEDs.   Their was a gunner up so the turret was open.  


Here is the bottom line, I could not make it even ten minutes before the heat became overwhelming and required me to pull the convoy over to do a dismounted patrol so my crew could cool down.  It was not a matter of being tough like those trainers tried to tell you.   The heat was so bad I had to do a dismounted patrol in a IED environment to cool down.   After the dismounted cool down patrol, I decided to have us crack the windows on the next lowest setting to prevent exposing the rest of the convoy to the risk.  Yes it is bad to crack the windows open in an IED environment but there was no other option.  


Sorry about the self righteous story.  It pisses me off when people try to be tough for no good reason and are creating unnecessary risk."
SeattleWA,fg4932t,t3_ewa31m,1580498753.0,There should be additional punishment added to crimes that are done to purposefully disfigure a person.  Cutting a woman's face with a razor blade should not be treated the same as other injuries from a legal perspective.
patientgamers,fg1tmvo,t3_ewb3oa,1580433031.0,"I hate to say this, but I will never play this game.   It being released just shortly before an anticipated game with a misleading title seemed like a feeble attempt at getting unearned sales.   Everytime I see this game, I waste seconds of my life figuring out that I do not want it."
Military,ffzfmh6,t1_ffz58lf,1580376642.0,"> which I can't quick make out - ""Post St...""?

That part says ""Post Studio"".  Most likely the ones that took or developed the photo."
worldnews,ffxeo26,t1_ffx83lp,1580323612.0,"Helmets are primarily there to protect against shrapnel and accidental head injuries.  They can stop a pistol round.   Pistol rounds are rarely encountered as most people are shooting rifles or machine guns.  A straight on rifle round will go through a helmet easily.  


You would be surprised at how many falls, falling objects and accidents occur on the battlefield also.  Combat vehicles moving around, people parachuting, or some diving in to a fighting position for example.  The helmet protects you from these hazards also."
patientgamers,ffw1x24,t1_ffvs17q,1580280843.0,People forget how advanced that branching rain drops running down glass was for a console back then.   I remember being memorized by the graphic effect.
community,ffulike,t3_ev621v,1580244488.0,Sometimes I regret not buying the community table v2 when it was on auction.     I do not have the space to store it.  I wanted it specifically because it was touched by Gillian.
army,ffp5vbf,t3_eudmmg,1580087015.0,I am sure we know that each rank acts like E-1s when they are by themselves in a school setting.  I can't speak for them but I am sure there is a SGM Academy Class saying the same thing.
army,ffk4ay0,t1_ffk2cxt,1580015403.0,"Considering how that particular Chick-fil-A has Soldier lined up there for the rest of the year, I think they can afford the promotion."
SeattleWA,ffcqx93,t1_ffci6tm,1579805399.0,"Totally agree that arrests should not be part of the conversation.   Then the police could arrest you 100 times with no convictions and have the court of public opinion declare you persona non grata.


  Convictions are relevant.  But what kind of convictions like you said...are they violent to be of concern to others around them?"
SeattleWA,ffb52vv,t1_ffb2hgw,1579752009.0,Convention center is huge.    If they have to search that it will take forever.  I hope there are no people in there for hostages.
movies,ffawxa7,t1_ffa5thi,1579746394.0,And the funny thing about that scene is they filmed the gunshots normally without messing them up in postproduction.
army,ff1vl0o,t1_ff00grc,1579487158.0,Shoot I remember the aviators taking proficiency flights to Vegas.   I knew they were on to something...
AccidentalRenaissance,fezzd3s,t1_fex69ky,1579463499.0,I was on operation with some Afghan Army.  I heard this huge boom on the other side of a truck like 10 feet away.  Afghan Soldier had a negligent discharge while sitting down and the muzzle of his M16 was a foot from his face.   Dude was in shock staring at his weapon like he betrayed him.  The look on his face reminded me of someone who was bit by their pet snake.  It would've been much worse had he rested his chin or his hand on the muzzle.
army,fetyskl,t3_eql3vp,1579381419.0,"We had a 4 day pass in Sofia, Bulgaria as R&R for a Kosovo deployment.   Decent looking city.  A super drunk Army guy got his wallet picked clean by a taxi driver.  Fortunately he was also deposited off at his hotel unharmed.   Never make that mistake again."
funny,feo1ngr,t3_eq2jdc,1579293932.0,So should I feel okay with doing this if the store doesn't have my size or desired color?   I feel guilty but I dont feel like I am being unreasonable either.
army,feekog4,t3_eoojfr,1579035693.0,Good leader stuff here.  A V device is a V device.  God knows all the politicking and 99 revisions it took to get here.
ThriftStoreHauls,fedvnw1,t1_fedtk61,1579020864.0,The narrator's voice mellows me out.

army,fd5ntpb,t1_fd2u4n3,1578179482.0,"Wow I did not know this happened.  Entire company stood down for recovery.  


As a side note I was temporarily attached to 256th during that period and I thought they were pretty straight.  They were out in some rough areas taking some big hits and kept on going.  At least the part if it I saw."
