I was in college around the time this album came out, and I remember sitting in a philosophy 101 class when some freshman guy contributed to the class discussion by stroking his beard and suggesting, ""Perhaps it is our lifestyle that determines our deathstyle.""  So as soon as I hit that line again in Frantic I had to turn it off."

With pastewax and Boeshield I still experienced rust even after recent applicaiton, on the other hand with WD40 I never experience rust unless I go too long before re-application.

Young people also have had less opportunity for hardship.  Death of loved ones, the grind of a corporate job, losing your job, the humbling experience of your body aging.  

Generally speaking the older you get the less you fear death.  Like Harry Potter, you go from fearing it like a villain to welcoming it like an old friend.
