depression,fddtyow,t3_ekndnp,1578323911.0,"I feel this. I haven't really had a group of friends since I was 16 and I'm 20 now. I feel like I've missed out on so much and it's too late now.
I've spent so long letting anxiety stop me from living my life."

I've haven't actually spoken to a guy on tinder yet who isn't just trying to fuck"
depression,fcv5ojp,t3_eixauo,1577995169.0,I know how you feel. I'm 20 and I've had depressive episodes since I was 12. It's difficult to remember the happy person I used to be.

depression,fcutk62,t3_ej0085,1577988214.0,"I don't think you're lazy. Lazy people have no desire to stop doing nothing.

I'm in the same position. Not wanting to do anything comes from the fact that taking action will bring negative feelings. I can't speak for you but I know that for me I avoid going out and socialising because I know that afterwards I'll analyse every conversation I had and spend the rest of the day thinking about it."
Anxiety,fcupvc0,t3_eit1wh,1577986103.0,It makes me scared to get into one in the first place. I feel like once someone realises how much it controls my life they'll leave me for someone more normal...
depression,fcoarqk,t3_ei19sk,1577827684.0,"Not alone but out with my parents.
I know it's better than being alone but would rather be with friends. I only have 2 friends who are both busy and I dont have a boyfriend.
I've been trying to not let it get to me but it's really getting me down. 
I'm 20 and most people my age are out or at home with friends"
