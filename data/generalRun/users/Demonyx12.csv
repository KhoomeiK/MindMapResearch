Fitness,ff64omw,t3_erui4m,1579619050.0,"Since I sit a lot for work and have a history of shoulder and low back issues a daily stretch routine is almost mandatory for me. Also, I'm an older lifter. Younger guys, folks with no/limited injury history, and those who don't sit for hours and hours a day may not require a stretching/mobility routine.

M-F before I eat lunch I do a brief stretch routine that primarily hits shoulders, hamstrings, and calves.  Has done wonders for keeping me pain and injury free. When I slack off I can feel the stiffness and pain creeping back in.

I'm told the science either is uncertain or shows that stretching is worthless but if I don't do it regularly I suffer pain (frozen shoulders, back goes out, etc.). So my stretching routine is either the worlds most powerful placebo or it is actually effective, either way I'm not stopping.

PS - My pet theory is that sitting too much and lack of regular walking is 90% of most peoples mobility/pain issues. Maybe humans who don't live out of a chair and walk all the time don't NEED stretches. I never once had a back issue as a kid and young adult until my academic career took off and I spent hours and hours a day sitting."

todayilearned,fejui2y,t1_fei8c5n,1579186145.0,"Completely disagree. Again you are conflating technology and science. Trial and error and manufacturing tools and basic crafts (including axes AND including and acknowledging your examples) are technological achievements not science.

Technology may require some rough empirical observation but not true insightful understanding or the creation of a systematic knowledge base. Crafting is not necessarily researching. Empirical observation while admittedly is a tool used by science, it is not science itself.

Technologies can come before and after and without true science. They can also be interdependent and complimentary with science to sure but they are both quite distinct from each other. You need to read broader than wikipedia.

Additionally, origins are not the thing per se. Single celled organisms respond evolutionary to interactions with the environment. The sensations these cells respond to is based on the empirical. Does this mean that science began four billion years ago with professor prokaryote? If yes, then that kind of definition of science is so broad as to be meaningless.
