This isn’t just dating, but it’ll come up time and time again as you make other decisions in your life that don’t align with theirs. Lying and hiding is a fool’s game. I’m also guju and female and I used to do this, but after a certain point in my mid 20s of hiding all my boyfriends (which never happened to be Indian), travels, parties, etc. I’m just like, screw it, if they disapprove then they’ll disapprove, but they love me so they’ll eventually get over it. Now our relationship is SO much more open and authentic, but it did take years to get there. Worth it.

Also re dating, I would never date a guy who would hide me for his parents. To me that’s a huge red flag in a relationship."
