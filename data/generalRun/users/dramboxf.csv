The other, the Virgil Flowers series, is about a Minnesota BCA (Bureau of Criminal Apprehension) detective. He has an investigative style that might resonate; he's not big into traditional detective work that you might see in the normal ""detective"" novels...he just sorta rambles around asking people questions. He's pulled some hilarious tricks in some of his investigations -- once he asked 20 people to make a list of thje 10 people they thought might have committed the murder. His thinking was that if 3 or 4 names appeared on all 20 lists, THOSE were the people he should investigate."

He had the same exact lunch every day of the week that he brought in a zipper lunchbag: A tunafish sandwich, a sugar-free jello pudding, a can of diet pepsi. He'd put that in the common-area work fridge.

One of the guys in my department (I was the IT Director) decided to just see how long we could fuck with, oh, let's call him Scott since that was his name. 

Scott got there at 7:00am every day and had lunch at 12:00 on the dot. 

So, starting the first week, my guy (let's call him Dave) would steal his cold soda at about 9:00am and replace it with a warm one. So it would get cold-ish with the 3-hours in the fridge, but not the ICE cold that Scott was expecting. 

Second week, he stole and replaced the Diet Pepsi at 10:00.

Third week, at 11:00am. 

Fourth week at 11:45. 

Now what was hilarious is that Scott was so fucking dumb he didn't realize THE REST OF HIS FOOD WAS COLD. It was just the Soda that was warm. 

The last week, Scott put the soda in the freezer at 7:00am. Dave found the soda and swapped in a warm one at like 11.55am.

Scott was getting madder and madder about this. What's amusing is that almost every other person in the company had already figured out what was going on without having to even be told (it was an engineering firm packed with PEs). And they ALL hated Scott."

If there is an all-powerful creator of the universe, pretty fucked up to think it looks like us. (""Created in His own image."")

All the suffering in this world explained with ""It's all part of God's (unknowable) plan.""

The paradox of predestination and free choice. If God gave us free choice (thus allowing sin) but God ALSO knows all that has happened, is happening and will ever happen, then God is just fucking with us the same way a kid does with a magnifying glass and some ants.

If there is a creator, it is absolutely, utterly incomprehensible to the human mind, and we are nothing but motes of dust. If God is everywhere, and inside each human heart, the idea that I need to spend a fixed amount of time in a special building every week so God knows I love him, well, then God is a narcissistic psychopath and I want no part of it. The very idea that God ""demands"" that we ""worship"" him/her/it, for me, puts the entire concept beyond redemption. The very idea that an entity powerful enough to create the universe, so powerful that it controls time and space, needs us, puny little hairless apes to ""worship"" it is hilarious.

My wife made an observation about religion when we first got together. It was along the lines of what is really or is really not a sin. Paraphrased, she said, ""All the big ones? The ones that ALL religions and spiritual belief systems share? Don't lie, don't cheat, don't steal, don't kill, don't fuck your neighbor's spouse? THOSE are legit. Anything else? Don't eat this food, wear that clothing, you must worship on this day? Bullshit. Every last one of them."""

He treats SF, a major fucking metro city, as an ""out of towner"" where he tries new material. He's not polished and does WAAAY too much ""crowd work"" for an A-lister. 

The 2nd Cobbs appearance he came out sick as a dog and the set just sucked. He ended with this giant bit about Jesus if he were a homicide detective working a hooker murder and I'm a hardcore atheist and it was just not funny. At all.

And yet, he's still my favorite. Segura, Mulany and Birbiglia are my other favorites."

santarosa,ffqp6ws,t1_ffpudty,1580140397.0,Yes. More DUI patrols. Far more DUIs are detected by regular patrol efforts than by checkpoints. There are apps you can download for your phone that tell you the instant a DUI checkpoint is setup. Not so much for random patrol.

AskReddit,ffpipdj,t3_eu725g,1580095991.0,"My wife and I live in California. Her sister lives in NYC. On that day, around 6:20, the phone rings. I sleep with earplugs in (I use a CPAP) and the phone is on my wife's side of the bed. 

I hear her answer it, and there's about 20 seconds of mumbling, and my wife's voice is getting more and more strident. 

All of a sudden she says, very loudly, ""What do you mean? ARE WE AT WAR?!?""

My first thought was, ""Ok, time to wake up and take the earplugs out.""

My wife waves me towards the bedroom door. ""Go turn on the TV!""

Like a movie character I say, ""Which channel?""

""ANY CHANNEL!""

I run into the living room and turn on the TV, which just happened to be tuned to CNN. JUST in time to see the 2nd plane crashing into the tower. (It was a replay.) 

That was a weird fucking day. I grew up just north of NYC. I couldn't wrap my head around the idea that the towers were just...gone."
