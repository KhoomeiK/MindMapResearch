AmItheAsshole,fc3aexe,t1_fc39lr3,1577385360.0,I get the child may have felt that pain. What I'm saying is that the blame for that pain still belongs with the mother because its her intentionally deceitful actions that allowed all this to happen.
AmItheAsshole,fc39b37,t1_fc38rsq,1577384581.0,Yes the child may have those issues but the blame for those issue ls because of the mothers actions. The child would have less a chance of having these issues if she didn't lie to begin with. If she looked for the bio dad when the truth first came out. If she didn't raise the child for a decade resenting a man that isn't even her father. It's ALL the mothers fault.
AmItheAsshole,fc38fwd,t1_fc3396f,1577383975.0,If he wasn't lied to he wouldn't have been there for the first 3 years. He and the child are both victims of the mothers deceit. The responsibility for all the child's pain related to this falls squarely on the mother's shoulders.
AmItheAsshole,fc373sf,t3_efup4p,1577383048.0,"NTA. It seems you had no choice in the matter. The child looked you up, they didn't accept being told you aren't their father. Yes you could've said ""ask your mother"". But let's be serious. This is someone who has a decade long history of lying to this child about this, would you really put faith in them to tell the truth? I would say OP had no choice but to tell the truth. The child wasn't going to get it anywhere else.

The child deserve the truth. They shouldn't have to live their life thinking they were abandoned by their father when they just weren't. They were left with their mother by a man who was tricked into thinking he was her father for 3 years. 

There's also the biological dad who is out there and probably doesn't even know he has a daughter. If either man has any responsibility for this child, it's the biological dad."

Unless they've stopped region locking consoles, but I've not heard anything about that. They'd be better waiting until it came available again in the uk."
ChoosingBeggars,fc61uzz,t1_fc61hio,1577470377.0,The whole thing is made up. It's satire. They aren't actually expecting anyone to give them the game.
ChoosingBeggars,fc61b87,t1_fc60tmh,1577470024.0,So you honestly think there is a possibility that this could be real? Ever been interested in buying a bridge? I have a few in manhatten I've been looking to offload to a new buyer.
ChoosingBeggars,fc5zs1t,t1_fc5bwzi,1577469188.0,No clue? Did you read it? There's plenty of clues.

Edit:bread to breed. Dogs aren't made of dough, apparently."
AmItheAsshole,fc3aexe,t1_fc39lr3,1577385360.0,I get the child may have felt that pain. What I'm saying is that the blame for that pain still belongs with the mother because its her intentionally deceitful actions that allowed all this to happen.
AmItheAsshole,fc39b37,t1_fc38rsq,1577384581.0,Yes the child may have those issues but the blame for those issue ls because of the mothers actions. The child would have less a chance of having these issues if she didn't lie to begin with. If she looked for the bio dad when the truth first came out. If she didn't raise the child for a decade resenting a man that isn't even her father. It's ALL the mothers fault.
AmItheAsshole,fc38fwd,t1_fc3396f,1577383975.0,If he wasn't lied to he wouldn't have been there for the first 3 years. He and the child are both victims of the mothers deceit. The responsibility for all the child's pain related to this falls squarely on the mother's shoulders.
AmItheAsshole,fc373sf,t3_efup4p,1577383048.0,"NTA. It seems you had no choice in the matter. The child looked you up, they didn't accept being told you aren't their father. Yes you could've said ""ask your mother"". But let's be serious. This is someone who has a decade long history of lying to this child about this, would you really put faith in them to tell the truth? I would say OP had no choice but to tell the truth. The child wasn't going to get it anywhere else.

The child deserve the truth. They shouldn't have to live their life thinking they were abandoned by their father when they just weren't. They were left with their mother by a man who was tricked into thinking he was her father for 3 years. 

There's also the biological dad who is out there and probably doesn't even know he has a daughter. If either man has any responsibility for this child, it's the biological dad."

AskReddit,fc2jmsw,t1_fc261gb,1577363658.0,"Not that many, this newer company has about 35 staff while the original telltale games had 400 at its peak. Granted that 35 are mostly from the original telltale games but it's still two different companies."

Im quite proud of that, I should probably think about volunteering at the hospital to help translate for other stroke victims."
AskReddit,fc1vchr,t1_fc131hv,1577330874.0,That's not the same company. When telltale games was winding down another company bought their name and is now trading using that name.
AteTheOnion,fc1jnub,t1_fc1c54j,1577320759.0,"Again, it depends on the product. A couple of factors off the top of my head that a lot of companies would deal with would be what the competition is charging for the same product/service. Shipping costs, manufacturing costs, research costs. Trade wars. All come in to play when determining the price of some things. If you ignore them and only go simply by demand of the product you will fail. Not all companies have the same factors, a lot can be unique to whatever industry/service they're in. 

Also with regards to your edit to your previous comment, the down votes are simply people disagreeing with your opinion but they can't be bothered getting into a debate on Christmas about the differences between capitalism in practice and capitalism in theory. Someone might not have liked the tone of the comment, not that I did or didn't. Someone's thumb could've slipped while scrolling. I wouldn't take it so personal. It just seems you've taken 8 people down voting you as a whole political movement turning their back and you and shunning you which would be a bit ridiculous."
AteTheOnion,fc15fa6,t1_fc128kw,1577308772.0,"Generally that's not exactly how it works in practice. There's multiple factors that determines price with demand only being one. Depends on the product as well, its not like there's a one size fits all formula for determining how everything is priced."
Tinder,fc01vql,t1_fbzxhrn,1577274269.0,"It makes complete sense when you realise he's purposely lying about his age to try and match with younger women but he's just not that good at it. He uses a younger picture of himself to try and sell the lie, not realising the dated picture itself can easily out his lie."
soccer,fbxiv4p,t3_eesh88,1577189647.0,Unless Man U start being interested in any of these players. Then their value will miraculously double.
