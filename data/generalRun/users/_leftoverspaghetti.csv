Portland,fecbduy,t1_fec3rb9,1578970097.0,I thought I posted something that might help folks who would otherwise assume they wouldn't be allowed shelter/safety. Sorry. Just trying to help.

Portland,fec3rb9,t1_feal7p3,1578966221.0,"Many of the shelters providing e-beds for the night (or when its announced ""severe weather"")  will allow pets (well behaved/can be around other people/pets), and many are low barrier - which means if you use/drink/are under the influence, it's cool, so long as you don't bring it to the shelter (or like, don't let anyone know or see you have stuff) and and can stay chill or somewhat composed and get along with folks.

So if you have a pet and/or use, or have used tonight, call 211 and let them know you have a pet or need a low-barrier shelter for the night. The earlier you get hooked up with a shelter, the better - some may have a capacity limit and are first come first serve.

Everyone stay safe and be kind to one another."
