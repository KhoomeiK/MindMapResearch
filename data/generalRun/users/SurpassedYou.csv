The way I look at it is simple, this is the only life I’m ever going to get, when it’s over it’s over. I’m very caring and sometimes it gets me in trouble, but I’m not going to waste much time on people that don’t enrich my life."

NYGiants,fcmoifq,t1_fcmoa1p,1577784377.0,"I see, very true. It's funny when we play road games and there are so many Cowboys fans there that it feels like a home game. 

I was born a Cowboy fan because of family/location, it would be much easier if I could remember the superbowl wins in the 90s."
NYGiants,fcmnyqb,t1_fcmjv5j,1577783610.0,In the last twenty years name the quarterbacks that have won two superbowls. Now name the quarterbacks that had two superbowl wins against Tom Brady.

Bill and Tom apparently hate each other, Bill is at the end of his contract, Tom is at the end of his career, Jerry knows he only has a few seasons left before he dies and is willing to do whatever to win another super bowl. I'm going to remind you all of this in a couple months."
