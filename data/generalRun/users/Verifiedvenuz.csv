UnearthedArcana,fd8vxyb,t1_fd8r5wx,1578224210.0,"I understand your reasoning on a gameplay level, but I do think it makes sense in-universe for the thing that determines your powers to be the one who granted them. I've intentionally framed the character so that he's very subserviant to his patron. (He's undead, she's the only thing keeping him alive) despite her being chaotic evil and him being nuetral good.  


Good to hear it doesn't break anything. Luckily I love talking about my characters, here's the backstory: I used him in the first session of my current campaign, he was a Kobold who got seperated from his two sibilngs and ended up growing up in a random city, he eventually discovered he had innate magic that made him a bard but simply believed he was extremely talented, doing things like using mending and believing he was an amazing carpenter. He ended up joining a pirate crew and quickly replacing the captain due to his powers and good people skills despite his idiocy. Forming genuine friendships with his crewmembers. He was known for being non-violent, very fast talking/acting, always being cheery and exclusively targeting people who were already well off (and making sure they had enough to get by afterwards) sorta like a selfish robin hood. Eventually his crew retired early due to a massively succesfull heist involving him using disguise self (which he believed was just him being really good with makeup) to pretend to be a rich womans husband and dancing with her whilst the crew stole everything in the house. He still thirsted for adventure and eventually joined the party, but he believed they were all pacifists, not just him and through a series of wacky excuses never believed that his partners were killing our enemies. That changed when during an interrogation our barbarian remarked that the person had ""Seen our faces"" and smashed their skull right in front of him.  


I loved this due to the new dynamic and played it up, making my character act cartoonishly traumatized (eg, using speak with animals to use a goose as a therapist) and eventually ended up trying to kill the Barbarian (with the player and dm's permission beforehand). When the Barbarian was mounteed on dangerous terrain, I casted sleep on the mount.  


The roll failed and he was split in half the next term, it was an ironic death because he had achieved his goal (wanted a warship, died on a warship, wanted to be a captain again, was the one commanding the crew.   


For the next few sessions, I've been using one of his brothers, an evil druid Kobold with a robot friend, plotting how to revive my old character. Eventually i made a deal with the dm and my character is going to pray to a god (Godess of diseases and poisons) and offer anything she could want in exchange for his life. I'm changing him to a warlock because he'll definitely be in servitude to the goddess. As a newly revived man he's got a much higher wisdom stat, and now relies on mask of many faces to hide his disfigured body. His familiar is the captain he replaced transformed into an imp by the goddess, sent to rat him out if he tries to do something like cure a disease. After being replaced he played the role of right hand man to my Kobold but secretly resented him. My kobold is now more of a semi-pacifist, descelating fights rather than simply avoiding them and sometimes even fighting back. (Hellish rebuke really fits him) and taking on a more confident persona as someone who seeks to protect others and stop evil, as apposed to simply craving adventures and helping people when it's convenient. My co-player actually changed characters from their barbarian because they felt they were too evil, but his long term goal is now to find and kill her as an npc. And his main flaw is the fact he's not really over what happened. I'm still working on the character so there's probably more I'll add.  


I personally don't know much about 3.5, but now you mention it the hex is a lot more relevant in this version."
UnearthedArcana,fd8or1t,t1_fd8m38y,1578221070.0,"Lol now that you mention it I'm one of the few people who dislike ""no negatives"" so it makes sense that it was intentional. I understand your reasoning for the Raven queen but it does leave a little void since it was the only familiar focus patron.

I personally am going to keep using cha over int, but that's partially because my character is a little dumb and I didn't realize it used int until I was done lol. Also I think its cha because your powers come from your ability to earn the favour of others 

I love hexblade being expanded as a pact because I no longer need to devote two invo slots for it, I thought that was restrictive on a class built around freedom."
UnearthedArcana,fd8kvoj,t1_fd8d7la,1578219583.0,"One more thing: I thought it was an interesting choice to turn hexblade from a patron to a pact, but it does make a lot of sense if you want pacts to be more influential on playstyle. I'm going for a semi melee build and if it weren't for how cool famliars are I would definitely have took it."
UnearthedArcana,fd8jcnv,t1_fd8d7la,1578219063.0,"I've been writing up a sheet for this class and honestly, this seems like it would be more fun in every way. And I think you should make the removal of eldrich blast (outside ofthat one pact) you mentioned to someone on this thread a bit more explicit. That was actually why I looked for this, I love the concept of Warlock but I also hate how it's centered around an incredibly boring projectile.

I personally prefer invocations to the pact progression because of the additional freedom, but if that's the direction you want then it's a fair reason to nerf invocations.I LOVE the jolt spell, it feels like a really good non-lethal option and is perfect for the nuetral good character I have.

Me and a friend had a lot of fun constructing a familiar from your new system, the openeness allows for way more intersting characters. My only complaint is it's very easy to get no negatives with the stats and you can cheat the system by getting the message cantrip instead of telepathy for a free point. I love the choices but I do wish there were more special traits, I will let you know if I have any ideas.

I also like the changes you made to the patron trees, most feel a lot more interesting now and the new ones have really cool premises. I am however curious why you removed the raven queen patron?"

1: go full hexblade and get smite and such  


2: get grasp of hadar and reskin eldrich blast to be some kind of sword on a chain  


3: think of a positive for the hypothetical homebrew invocation (Thanks for pointing out the ac thing, but if I go melee I'm gonna calculate it as one attack, like 1d20 instead of 2d10)
