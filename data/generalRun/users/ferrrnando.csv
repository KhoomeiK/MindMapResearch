classicwow,ffsphhq,t1_ffsb4bu,1580187990.0,I would drop trade to my alts. Do you mean drop trading once they enforced the trade rules where you essentially couldn’t give things out for free?

Awwducational,ff58uoj,t1_ff3bauy,1579583695.0,Your question made me imagine a prairie dog committee charged with keeping their language standardized across North America lol. I’d imagine they do have different cultures.

Virginia,feknb8i,t1_fekk1so,1579203613.0,"You’re not wrong but wouldn’t you have to draw the line somewhere. There is an imminent potential for a gun to end a life in the blink of an eye, how can you compare that to a chicken sandwich. Would you say it’s ok for me to walk into a crowded place with a bomb that I control with a button. That relies on user input to detonate."
Virginia,fekja5k,t1_fekiakd,1579201213.0,Sorry for pandering. I really didn’t think you were trying to have civil discourse when your  brought up chicken sandwich murder weapons so I’d though it’d just troll with you. Everything you just said just has nothing to do with this thread.
Virginia,feketke,t1_fek89jn,1579198555.0,Good point. I don’t know why they’re talking about guns as if they were the issue. Why is nobody talking about murders by chicken sandwiches. Hold those fast food restaurants responsible!

classicwow,feem6lk,t1_fedpyl0,1579036570.0,Maybe not a problem for you because you’ll move on to playing some other games. But a problem for blizzard if they lose all those subs.
classicwow,feazbos,t1_feah2mf,1578953817.0,Not that I disagree with you but. Did you really lvl them through questing though? I imagine you’d quest at least until you can run the first dungeon and then just dungeon level all the way to 60
classicwow,fe0ht5e,t1_fe02min,1578813649.0,Sounds like a lot of effort
