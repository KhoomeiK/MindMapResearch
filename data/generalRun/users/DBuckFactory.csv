beerporn,ffikr1c,t1_ffhk5hc,1579976220.0,It's better than it sounds but you have to use the right beer.  I've had a couple of beer floats that are good.
FloridaGators,ffikeer,t3_etsh2h,1579975975.0,Anyone have the whole routine?

findapath,ff91281,t1_ff89k2v,1579702161.0,"Most colleges won't accept 7 year old classes from a community college in a different state due to accreditation issues.  She can test out like I said, but I wouldn't bet on really old credits from counting outright.  I'd rather tell her the truth than beat around the bush and give hope for something that is a longshot.

GetEmployed,ff83i2n,t3_es5zeh,1579665006.0,I'm legit working in supply chain for a large energy company.  I have a lot of co-workers that are fresh out of college (though I'm not).  I actually like the job and it pays decently.  Teaching is difficult and there's a lot more to it than it seems.  My wife is a teacher and she puts a ton of extra hours into it.
SalsaSnobs,ff82ix9,t1_ff7xg72,1579664286.0,Same for me.  I soak my arbols and they still come out rough and won't blend.
findapath,ff7hk9w,t1_ff7aw9d,1579649709.0,"Also your credits are 99% probably worthless due to the time passage, but you can test out of a lot of general education stuff and maybe jump to the interesting bits.  Good luck"
MarvelStrikeForce,ff7h027,t1_ff758ud,1579649339.0,"For some, voting either way makes the post hidden.  That cheapens the process a bit and makes it not matter which way you vote as much."
fatlogic,ff75ngc,t1_ff6zy49,1579641608.0,"She already did it and the weight has been off for over a week afterwards so far.  She ate very little and exercised a whole lot.  She basically had to cut 10,500 calories over her basic expenditure in that time frame.  Didn't seem likely, but the scale shows it.  It's probably a couple pounds of water weight or something."
fatlogic,ff586ss,t1_ff5617a,1579583091.0,"Of course not, but it's for her wedding so she doesn't have to spend money on a new dress.  Not for a long term loss.  She did a lot of veggies, fish, juices, and cardio.  Not sustainable at that level, but doable for a cut to get where you need to be."
deadpool,ff54l54,t3_erkb4l,1579580066.0,This was 100% a joke and right in his wheelhouse.
fatlogic,ff541jw,t1_ff4uaya,1579579636.0,Friend of mine got fitted for her wedding dress and had to lose 10 lbs in two weeks to give a seamstress enough time for alterations.  She actually pulled it off.  Hopefully she keeps that off plus maybe a few more for the wedding next month.  Sometimes you don't know.
criticalrole,ff3kwsk,t3_erdc10,1579543232.0,"I started listening on podcast like a year ago and I caught up.  My job had a lot of driving though, so that helped.  Also listened while doing dishes or cooking and stuff like that.  I even have a baby too, so I somehow found the time."
ufl,ff2cd0w,t3_er3hdg,1579500542.0,I met my wife through a friend while at school there.  We graduated a long time ago though.
specializedtools,fethfdv,t1_fegtrpu,1579375509.0,I didn't think they went down too low.  Depends on perspective I guess.

lfg,fet85gt,t3_enu7mj,1579372640.0,"Hey I might be interested in joining.  I'm currently in a weekly game on Wednesdays.  I am 33, dude, married with a young girl.  I've only been playing for almost 2 years but I've played a bunch of different characters.  I'm busy some weekends, but I can usually play.  I'll be out of town this weekend and next, but otherwise mostly clear."

DnDGreentext,feiw18r,t1_feicyfa,1579148751.0,I legit looked for this song on Spotify a few weeks ago.  Found a version by Matthieu Boré that's pretty good.  Wish I could find the original that this was based off of.
specializedtools,fegnj93,t1_feghn91,1579098044.0,"Pretty much.  Palms generally have root balls.  A bunch of fibrous pieces that don't go out very far from the center of the root ball itself.  Depends on the palm, of course.  Some do get some pretty large spread (for palms).  I used to manage landscaping services in South Florida (Keys through Marion County on the east coast)."
spicy,fefo18x,t1_fefgle0,1579060556.0,Or have a lot of wet naps.  I can't eat wings like normal any more.  I pick at them like a baby so I don't get any sauce in my beard.
Cooking,fef1nxf,t1_feewx3u,1579046077.0,I use a mix of Serious Eats and some Jamaican travel website recipe I found.  I've had one bad set of it.  I never write it all down though.  Probably should someday.
cosplaybabes,fef0jf5,t1_fef04qk,1579045333.0,"No idea man.  Don't use the site, just know about it.  I wasn't the one that saw her on there.  I don't think the posts would stay up too long with prostitution being illegal in the US and all, but idk!"

TumblrInAction,feey615,t1_fedql4x,1579043791.0,"Privelege doesn't mean that you get whatever you want.  It just means that you're a step ahead of someone else.  It's not erased because you also have a shitty life.  However, it really doesn't matter in a lot of cases.  People throw it around like it's something to be ashamed of or to make themselves feel better.  It's mostly just dumb people trying to argue how oppressed they are at this point.  Makes me give less of a fuck."
seriouseats,fec8y3f,t1_fe8rrac,1578968741.0,This is one of my favs to make!  I can't make much for my DnD group because they have very different dietary restrictions.
dndmemes,fe7cjbw,t1_fe6e8j9,1578912806.0,I explained what I was saying in my other comments below.
dndmemes,fe5ryqw,t1_fe5qrei,1578873659.0,"That's why the OP saying he rolled a 20 to seduce the dragon is ridiculous.  Bruh you can't just seduce an intelligent, sentient monster of a different species with one roll.  Just like I can't roll Arcana to cast a spell or get through a ritual that isn't a spell on the book.  There are usually more than one step to things like that."
dndmemes,fe5qc01,t1_fe5gpa7,1578873078.0,"I'd run it more of a skill challenge with more than one dice roll, but I also don't really do fantasy sex stuff in my games either."
dndmemes,fe5pusr,t1_fe5kki7,1578872810.0,"Yeah I know but people constantly talk about seduction checks like it's a skill.  I think it's more of a skill based on how you go about it.  Deception, persuasion, straight charisma, performance, and even constitution might tie into it.  If you go on a date or go for a hookup, seducing someone isn't going to be just a quick few words.  It'll probably take a few things."
dndmemes,fe5f0ck,t1_fe4pmnj,1578868658.0,"But there's no seduction skill

Edit:. Also using seduction all the time is gross lol"
GetEmployed,fdtvaln,t3_emuvqn,1578722774.0,"I totally bombed my interview for where I'm working now.  The lady cold called me like 5 minutes after I had put my daughter down for a nap.  Zero schedule, zero notice.  She asked.me questions about the company and how my experience was related to the job specifics.  I flat out told her that I was a bit nervous and tried to get through the interview as best as I could.  

Somehow I got a second interview that I did really well on and then I had in person interviews that I think I did extremely well in.  Preparation is key.  I had my wife drill me on all of the usual interview questions and info about the company a few minutes every day.  I probably got lucky still."
FloridaGators,fdttkx2,t1_fdsz0mw,1578721985.0,Oh man my dad went there when I was growing up.  I still count them as my second favorite lol.  Crazy how different experiences shake out!

FloridaGators,fd9pgb7,t1_fd6e8xn,1578236340.0,"I mean, the team is getting shots.  They just can't make them fall.  It's insane how low their shooting percentage is.  Idk if it's all Mike Whites fault but we'll see how the rest of the season goes."
DnDGreentext,fd9lsld,t1_fd8e6ve,1578235095.0,Late game they are kinda weak IMO.  Low damage bois.  I played one to level 16 and felt like I could do little but try to stun at higher level.
FloridaGators,fd6zhfw,t1_fd6c189,1578197629.0,I was laying in bed and was too lazy to turn it on and I saw the score.  Was meh.  Gave the baby a bath until just after halftime and watched it.  Glad I did!
FloridaGators,fd6z53g,t1_fd6d6fy,1578197518.0,He's been putting in more effort.  Sometimes he tries to be that handling guard and no.  Fucking no.  But that steal was amazing.  My wife and I went a little nuts and I couldn't believe it was Locke!
ATBGE,fd57l2y,t1_fd4k2qr,1578174978.0,No it's not Dr. Phil's place of living.  It's his son's and it's an anti-gun art piece.
ATBGE,fd3jab9,t1_fd2j2bf,1578158870.0,Lol it's not even Dr. Phil's house.  His trust owns it and his son lives there.
ATBGE,fd3j1wq,t1_fd2ae65,1578158800.0,It is a house owned by Dr. Phil's trust that his son was living in.  The guns are all melted because it's an art piece.  You can get a better look on the house's listing online.

MimicRecipes,fcib7an,t1_fchy77o,1577660019.0,Also more surface area means more crisp.  Serious Eats' method is to bang them around a bit before frying.  I usually put the lid back on after draining them and shake them up a bit.
