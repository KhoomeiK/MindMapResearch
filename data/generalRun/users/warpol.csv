thatHappened,fgl4xue,t1_fgkww66,1580882159.0,"To be fair, a senators kid would probably be slightly more likely to follow this kind of stuff and his dad would be more likely to talk about climate change than your average Joe. So the chances of this being true increase due to his position. I mean his dad coulda legitimately been like ""I hope a main issue is climate change"" the day before. Kids do parrot their dads. As for the heart attack thing, maybe a touch of hyperbole."

Like who cares if people take your recipes and mod them the way they like, people can eat what they want? That said I guess that's potentially my views on 90% of cultural appropriation so maybe I'm missing some nuance who knows."

facepalm,fggvc6b,t1_fgf7ub2,1580770384.0,"The logic of these people is that in their views, the fetus is a living being, and therefore following those views, it's understandable that they call it murder. I'm not anti-abortion but it's an understandable pov because the line of when a fetus becomes a child is pretty vague. 

For example taking these views to their real life equivalent, if there was a newborn and the mother wanted to kill it because she didn't want it and you convinced her not to, do you think you should then be responsible to look after it once it gets taken off her? 
Yes this is a different situation in our views, but in theirs it is not."

TopMindsOfReddit,ff6zxjc,t1_ff5snsz,1579638339.0,"Doing funny things too statues can also be disrespectful to be fair but I get where you're coming from, I imagine it's very true that'd cause uproar. As for the mlk stuff, the waters are muddied by the fact he has surviving family on both sides of the political spectrum, arguing both ways. So I'd still say, whilst in general I think you're right and it's very unlikely that a black rights activist would be a trump supporter if you were to modernize them, modernizing isn't so cut and dry."
TopMindsOfReddit,ff5rxa4,t3_erhl71,1579607907.0,"Putting a cap on a statue isn't really disrespect especially if they legitimately believe what they're saying. Also arguing a historical figures modern day political alignments either way is a bit shady. The current Republican party ""hating black people"" isn't the same as that eras hating black people, and is pretty arguable for both sides. Not saying one side or the other is wrong or right, I'm not american so tbh don't have an in depth knowledge of race in America, but I'm 100% sure it's not all black and white (I wanted to avoid the pun but honestly i dunno an alternate phrase and am too lazy to find one)."

Not to mention socialising with coworkers may instill trust, and also let people get a proper read on you. There's a bunch of reasons that socialising can lead to success, it's a valuable skill.

EntitledBitch,fe7k7rx,t1_fe6jmq3,1578915740.0,"None of that is really the point I was getting at. In my opinion (yes it's an opinion I'm not claiming it is the only true choice), even if the service was better in America than other places (lack of evidence other than Americans often claiming it), it is a better time as a customer to be paying a laid out price rather than needing to calculate it,  especially if it's pretty much a requirement anyway. Then the tip can always be on top. 

Also your comment ignored the end part of my last comment."
worldpolitics,fe7fxqy,t1_fe6zts6,1578914133.0,I assume the above person was looking for some kind of source/proof of that. Which I've actually been looking for also. I realise it'd be quicker to Google but I'm in a lazy mood.
EntitledBitch,fe61zmr,t1_fe5ocpa,1578879988.0,"Nah you misunderstood my discomfort point. I'm talking from a purely selfish customer pov, why should the customer be responsible for paying the wait staff. It puts extra pressure on the customer to make sure they tip the right amount or spend more than they want. Dining out should be a relaxing experience, and whilst minor, that interrupts that. Things should be how much they say they are. Also your example of still getting the same even for a less than optimal job kinda shows that it isn't so much a way to secure better service standards. 

Sure it's up to the individuals, but sometimes there is very limited job opportunity, so for a lot of people, a wage would be better than pure tip system."
EntitledBitch,fe5l6yz,t1_fe5cxvv,1578870880.0,"Australian here, so we don't pay for public bathrooms or public water. 

Often the reason foreigners who don't have to tip think it's bad is because it pressures the customer into paying the server rather than them getting paid a reasonable amount to start with which to me as a customer at least would be a more comfortable dining experience. (The getting tips means better service I doubt because here in Aus you still get great service). 

In the end it's not so much about the cost, because when there is no tipping the price is added to the meal anyway so everything would cost about the same. Although whilst some great servers can pull in more money for tips, it also means folks working at quiet businesses would get basically nothing for the same amount of time, if not effort."

However if it's lunch time and you're just stopping in for a meal at a pub or something different story. 

As for your sport cap, I can understand people wanting to wear merch in celebration, but also I would say you should generally respect house rules, but if she agreed no harm no foul."

Imagine being at a restaurant and singing, whistling or playing Gameboy, it's pretty rude. Plus singing and whistling would be disruptive to the others if they wanted to chat. As for the hat thing, some people just have rules about hats indoors and I guess at a dining table is a more formal setting.
