TaskRabbit,ff7y6rf,t1_ff7xl78,1579661169.0,"I’m absolutely nauseous over this. I’ve never been fired, or even written up in my multiple decades of my life. I messed up my first and probably only task."
TaskRabbit,ff7ulua,t1_ff7uer4,1579658741.0,"Oh god, I thought it was 3%! Ugh. Well, I’ll never make that mistake again. I didn’t try to be shady... I just didn’t want to argue with a nice old lady."
YouShouldKnow,ff7thkg,t1_ff7tdmm,1579657973.0,I know!!! They all do!! Gahh!
YouShouldKnow,ff7taut,t1_ff7t2y1,1579657841.0,"It’s genius. I’ve wanted to buy flowers so many times, but either the bouquets are not what I want, or there’s something that isn’t cat-safe in them. This is absolutely perfect. :)"
YouShouldKnow,ff7swzd,t3_es4spp,1579657574.0,I had no idea! Thanks!!
whatisthisthing,feukcif,t3_eqngrh,1579387316.0,I now need to know what kind it is! It looks so soft and fluffy!

menwritingwomen,fdfr116,t3_el5e8t,1578368111.0,That’s a ‘call 911’ situation.
resumes,fdfkh25,t1_fdfk9pd,1578363801.0,"Thank you!! I think I can re-word it and make it shine. I just didn’t know what to do. I can definitely change up some of the lingo to make it work. He’s got the experience and he’s darn good at what he does, so it was hard trying to figure out how to get the resume to do its thing."
Career_Advice,fdfk9yz,t1_fdfk1ud,1578363675.0,"Yeah, $15 an hour is tight but it’ll get the mortgage and most bills covered temporarily. $45 is much closer to where we were at before the stuff hit the fan last year."
Career_Advice,fdfjwng,t1_fdfjpud,1578363434.0,"Sadly, money is an issue. Worth a shot though, especially if it’s temporary. It might buy him time to pass the SAP exam, though!"
resumes,fdfju1s,t1_fdffl1i,1578363387.0,Ahhhh PERFECT!! Ok. I can re-word it. THANK YOU!! (Yes! I’m yelling out of excitement and gratitude.)
Career_Advice,fdfjm4y,t1_fdfjaur,1578363239.0,"I don’t even think he has thought about Business Analyst roles. That title isn’t even on his radar, but it’s definitely worth looking into! He’s great at selling himself in person, it’s just that we haven’t had great luck getting callbacks. It’s definitely the resume, for sure. 

We were back and forth with a few temp agencies, but it seems like a slow process. 

Thank you!! :)"
resumes,fdfespo,t1_fdfdr06,1578360007.0,"I have been a stay at home mom for 13 years, so this is all Greek to me. I’m trying, though! What does it mean that “skills such as Leadership and Inventory Control are deal breaker.” So keep those off? 

I need and appreciate all the help I can get! :)"
resumes,fdfbpok,t1_fdf6p1k,1578357924.0,"Hi!! Thank you for replying!! I didn’t even know about STAR. :) [This](https://www.indeed.com/m/viewjob?jk=869ee2fd5e43bc00&from=appshareios&dupclk=0)  is what he sent to me.

spirituality,fca1yb0,t3_egf7hp,1577561807.0,"I have felt that way most of my life. I didn’t even “plan” on a certain kind of future, because I didn’t think I’d live that long. I’m now 39, and I don’t feel that way as much anymore. No matter what, live each day the best you can... even the crappy ones. :)"
