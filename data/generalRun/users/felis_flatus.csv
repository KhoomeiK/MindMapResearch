StartledCats,ff4cwiv,t1_ff4cql4,1579560644.0,Lol I like how we both posted basically the same thing at the same time 👍🏻👍🏻
StartledCats,ff4cr3m,t1_ff4ce6z,1579560548.0,"Autonomous sensory meridian response. It’s the tingling sensation or goosebumps a person gets when listening to specific things. For me, a specific part of songs often does it. For others, whispering, crinkling paper, soothing voices, etc. Just depends on the person. If you look up “ASMR video” on YouTube, you’ll find loads of examples."
TheDepthsBelow,ff3st2o,t3_erdgm2,1579548082.0,"Looks like that scuba diver lost ownership rights over their footage. It was taken by the manta, and mantas can’t legally own things. Must be public domain now!"
Showerthoughts,ff2bdnz,t1_ff253jo,1579499558.0,"That looks different from the mice I opened. All of the early ball mice I used were mechanical, though I didn’t use a single PC mouse until they were optical. All my early mousing was done on Macs, which were entirely mechanical."
GetMotivated,fe9lqfk,t3_eo5g3s,1578939227.0,I like to think of it in relation to butter. A pound of butter is one box. Looks like a hell of a lot more when I see it that way.
blender,fe0jd7b,t3_en6gx9,1578814327.0,Now THIS is art! Very nice.
DidntKnowIWantedThat,fe0gasq,t1_fdzw8jv,1578812960.0,"Very good point. Maybe another tactic would be to call 911, then immediately call or otherwise reach out to a close neighbor or friend that can help while waiting. Keep up chest compressions for a short while instead of a long while. Just trying to think ahead to the eventuality of being old and my wife having to get help when I inevitably have heart issues (runs in the family, regardless of diet)."
DidntKnowIWantedThat,fdqp7a6,t1_fdpxhk7,1578671892.0,"Good point. I was thinking more along the lines that the person may have enough strength to put a device like that on someone, but not to maintain chest compressions for an extended period. But if it’s that difficult to even move the person to put it on, what options are available for people in those sorts of situations?"
DidntKnowIWantedThat,fdpuoy1,t1_fdptfqt,1578641233.0,"Or it’s a real question. There are all sorts of scenarios where an EMT would not be available, potentially for a very long time. An older or weaker person may not have the ability to maintain proper rhythm for chest compressions long enough for a medical professional with training to save them. Having a device that performs that for them while they make calls, help with breathing, or monitor vitals and wait for someone to arrive could make all the difference they need."
AskReddit,fdniq4h,t1_fdnhpo5,1578586647.0,"I’m not saying I agree with that, just that I can understand it.

You’re absolutely right—if a kid wants to stay up later, they should be able to and learn about the consequences. But they should be made aware of those consequences beforehand so they can make an educated decision.

Likewise with eating too soon before bed. Too many parents just say, ‘do this because I said so,’ instead of ‘do this for these real reasons.’ If a kid does the wrong thing after knowing the reasons behind doing the right one, then the decision becomes their fault and you can point it out to them when they’re suffering from the consequences later. But it has to be their -educated- decision."
Baking,fdmlkrj,t3_elz3sq,1578554538.0,"I hate macaroons...airy, sugary, flavorless garbage. But these look beautiful. If you were my friend and made these for me, I’d eat one and tell you it tastes amazing because of how beautiful it is and how much work it looks to have taken. Good job!"
AskReddit,fdmj0rh,t1_fdm5875,1578551669.0,"Both of these rules make sense to me as an adult, but would have driven me nuts as a kid.

9pm bedtime ensures you get all your bed prep done and laid down in time to have plenty of rest before waking up at the insanely early times required by schools.

7pm food limit helps prevent acid reflux during the night, which helps ensure better oral health as well. I also remember something about late eating affecting your quality of sleep, too, so maybe it also helps you sleep better?

So yeah, sounds like your parental units were just trying to ensure you did the healthy thing."
aww,fdmioeb,t1_fdmfpgv,1578551302.0,"Terrific ideas! I settled on the clover idea because it’s already gaining popularity, especially in places with less water and communities concerned about all the massive die-offs of bees. Once I manage to get that concession, I’ll see about extending that to wildflowers 😀"
aww,fdmbb0n,t1_fdlyruu,1578544568.0,"We’re buying a house soon that has an HOA. I plan on secretly spreading clover seeds on everyone’s lawns. Then badgering the HOA into agreeing that, not only does it look nice, but it’s also better for our health, our pocketbooks, and the environment."

tifu,fdef6ld,t1_fddr8p5,1578337697.0,"Family just sucks at seeing humor when their children or siblings are in apparent danger. My brother got angry at me for making jokes when I was about to go in for abdominal surgery. It’s natural for me to use humor to lighten a heavy situation, even more so when I’m being pumped full of opiates. He got over it, though."
Art,fcvw4d3,t3_ej2p7x,1578011431.0,I love it! Beautiful and cute
curlyhair,fcvvvi4,t1_fcvvpcl,1578011272.0,"Yep! It’s also called “dumb cane”, but I like the other name better. Yours looks really healthy :)"

DadReflexes,fcpg86h,t1_fcmrdak,1577862612.0,"Good to know. I'll have to read into that, then. I haven't learned anything different for about 20 years. Thanks!"
aww,fcoqs4m,t1_fcnuy65,1577839064.0,"I would love nothing more than to snuggle with a tiger, but I refuse to do so with it drugged. So it’s a dream that will never become a reality, because I’m not too keen on getting mauled."
DadReflexes,fcmclg5,t1_fclkd5s,1577770556.0,"I’m confused by this statement. I’ve always heard that you’re supposed to head to doorways, at least if you have a newer house."
DadReflexes,fcle7io,t1_fcldm97,1577745747.0,"Oh, I certainly agree. The oak table is an old handmade table. Most tables now are made out of particle board, even the sturdiest of which is flimsy by comparison.

I’ve got a few other locations (doorways, mostly) at home I’d definitely jump to before the table, unless I have no choice. Just pointing out that there are still some sturdy tables out there."
DadReflexes,fcldb3g,t1_fclahum,1577745157.0,"Pretty sure this depends on the table. I have a table I wouldn’t trust with the weight of my two cats. But I also have an oak table I’d trust with the weight of the roof on it. Thing is ridiculously sturdy, almost to the point of being overbuilt."
AskReddit,fc7lkgr,t3_egi52s,1577511382.0,What is that smell?
