Most people who need kidneys wait around 5 years for them. Looks like prior living donors are waiting an average of 3-5 months.

Also, the prioritization applies to you for any organ you might need, not just the type you donate. Not to mention if you donate a kidney you might just set off a chain donation and help dozens of people get kidneys.

Many people like to sleep in a colder temperature and just cover up, it's comfy! But you're body tries its best to do whatever the human equivalent of short term hibernation is. I guess we just call that sleep, whatever. But, if you sleep in a warmer temperature, it's a lot easier to wake up and get going.

Therefore, similar to that alarm clock that slowly makes your room brighter to wake you up, you should have a temperature controller with a timer that way an hour or an hour and a half before your going to wake up the temperature can begin increasing to appropriate levels so that when you wake up, your body is at the perfect temperature. Like all things it may require a little experimentation, but it should help with the waking up as well as getting out of bed.

Also, just give yourself enough time so that you don't need to use your alarm clocks, those things will end up killing you."
