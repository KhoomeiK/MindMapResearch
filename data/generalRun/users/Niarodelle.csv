CPTSD,ff8k2ao,t1_ff8hear,1579682188.0,"I dunno if it'll help but this reminded me of the song ""spaceship"" from Kesha's rainbow album which all deals with lots of trauma stuff."
CPTSDmemes,ff7dhzv,t1_ff6dlmr,1579647036.0,Omg are you me? I honestly don't know how to feel anything but jealousy and resentment to people who are CIS and neurotypical on top of emotional neglect and abusive relationships like it feels like the universe is just trying to make things as complicated and difficult as possible...
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,ff79ery,t1_ff609o5,1579643805.0,My cousin's name is Kaiden so it's definitely around! I think he'd be around 20 so if you're in that area then there is guaranteed other people who got named Kaiden :)
TrollCoping,ff0baul,t1_fezntcx,1579467160.0,There's the fast bad one and the slow bad one and there's apparently a good one but so far I've only seen the one that's just kind there but doesn't do anything...
CPTSDmemes,fefishu,t3_eoq8wd,1579057201.0,Ooof fuck this was a real gut punch
BetterEveryLoop,fecwghg,t1_fecu43h,1578987354.0,Thank you
TalesFromYourServer,fecq30y,t1_fecioi4,1578980518.0,I think it was supposed to be a joke. It just didn't land...
ADHD,fecnmf4,t3_eobufh,1578978449.0,"I should save this Post so I can read it later!

12 years later..."
BetterEveryLoop,feckeq7,t3_eod36j,1578976066.0,I wish my parents could have told me they were proud of me... Just for anything really...
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fecgxtv,t1_fecghgo,1578973660.0,"It sounds like you're taking this a lot more personally than you need to.

I'm not interested in an argument. I just want everyone to be able to express themselves however they most feel comfortable, be that as a witch, a priestess or a princess or any combination thereof."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fecf6lz,t1_fecam69,1578972463.0,"And that's perfectly fine for you to live how you want to, but that doesn't mean that other people who do want to associate with the term are any worse than those who don't."
NarcissisticAbuse,feceoev,t1_fece4il,1578972123.0,"I'm not virtue signalling at all.

I am a transgender woman who has to deal with bigotry and hatred and listen to these slurs on a daily basis and I respectfully asked you not to use a slur. 

I understand how much this situation sucks for you but that is no excuse to use slurs against a minority group."
NarcissisticAbuse,fecdzld,t1_feah9yp,1578971655.0,Could you address the use of the slur transvestite?
NarcissisticAbuse,fecdxeo,t3_eo71bv,1578971616.0,I understand that this is absolutely horrible but please don't use the slur transvestite and don't use someone's gender as a reason that she is a bad person.
Wellthatsucks,febzyb0,t1_febzr06,1578964752.0,"Oh jeez you've shown me the error of my ways. 

Don't have kids - hopefully you'll just end up oding yourself before you can further extend your clearly fucked up genetics which you seem to clearly be so obsessed about"
Wellthatsucks,febzffg,t1_febyy7m,1578964548.0,Is that really the only thing you can come up with? I mean I understand that you're using 99% of your brain just to keep your circulatory system running but jeez at least try come up with a new insult
Wellthatsucks,febxdil,t1_febwwms,1578963850.0,"Honey if you still don't know then you've got bigger problems because honestly it sounds like you have dementia with how poorly you're following this conversation...

I'll keep it simple so you understand.

You=big dum dum
Autism=not an insult

Was that simple enough for your drug addled brain?"
Wellthatsucks,febwdp8,t1_febvu9h,1578963482.0,"Hahaha you're so pathetic it's honestly hilarious how badly you feel you need to defend yourself over this. Seems like you've got pretty low self esteem. I mean I understand, if my only redeeming quality was being attractive and I couldn't even do that well I'd be pretty upset too."
Wellthatsucks,febvhmd,t1_febuupm,1578963172.0,"I bet you voted for trump, I will say I do understand wanting to vote for someone with the same level of intelligence as you though so I can't really blame you"
