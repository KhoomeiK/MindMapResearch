GetMotivated,fgijj1z,t3_eyp00o,1580823502.0,"I get the sentiment, but unfortunately the internet is full of misinformation and every documentary has at least some b.s. (some more than others). Many people who ""self educate"" end up going down a rabbit hole of self-delusion. That's why it's important to have an expert (i.e. a professor) on hand to challenge what you think you know."

HumansBeingBros,fg3plko,t3_ew9pnh,1580486934.0,"Pirating games is what got me into gaming to begin with. As I got older and started making more money, the hassles that come with pirating games (no online gaming, manually patching updates, no support, potential viruses) didn't seem worth it anymore. Especially with all the great deals you get with Steam sales. I've gone back and purchased all the games I've pirated because I wanted to play them again on my upgraded hardware."

facepalm,fesle31,t3_eqfx9v,1579366437.0,"I agree that having a separate ceremony for the black students would be a step backwards, but that article failed to mention that the black students also participated in the main graduation ceremony with the rest of the students. This was just a small crowdfunded effort to show how far Harvard has come from the days when they wouldn't let black people enroll. I don't think the organizers realized how something like this could backfire."

They were both hospitalized and it's nothing short of a miracle her kid survived. They're now up to date on all their shots.
