science,ff8o651,t1_ff7w4bf,1579688450.0,"I can fall asleep any time and anywhere, I'm very lucky in that regard. I just wanted to comment about the biphasic sleep part of your comment. I sleep for about four hours, wake for one or two, and then sleep another four or so. In fact I'm actually on my awake break right now as it's 5am here. I just find that I naturally wake up after that amount of time. Highly recommend it to other people!"
