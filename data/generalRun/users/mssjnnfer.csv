What she did was bad. Disrespectful. But you’re her parent. You’re going to disown her? Have you honestly tried everything? Therapy? And her punishment is to go live with her other parent... what message is that sending?

I get you’re frustrated, but you’re supposed to be the more mature person in this scenario. I feel bad for your daughter."

AskReddit,fewm8hc,t3_eqies2,1579414401.0,"Years ago a friend of mine invited me to join her church. It was a small church. The pastor and his wife were very nice and everyone was so welcoming. My friend told the pastor that I was a singer. Their usual church singer had just moved away so they needed a new one, and he asked if I would. At first I declined, I get shy singing in front of people I don’t know. He said he wouldn’t give up asking me until I accepted. He asked every Sunday for several weeks. 

One day I was trying to sign up for a website and had to do the CAPTCHA thing to prove I’m not a robot. The thing where it gives you random garbled letters and numbers and you have to type it in. Except my letters weren’t random. My letters were -

TrueOffMyChest,fewko81,t3_eqiiai,1579412825.0,"One time I called Sam’s Club to order a cheese pizza for my boyfriend and I. (Seriously have you tried their pizza? It’s awesome and like $8.) I ordered it before driving because it’s like a 15 min drive with traffic. (I live in a suburb of Phoenix.) the person on the phone (a male) said it would be about 15 mins. Cool. 

So I get there, go up to the counter and let them know I had ordered the pizza. The gal behind the register looked worried and kinda started looking around before finally coming back over to me and letting me know they never got a phone order for a pizza, but if I didn’t mind waiting they’d have one ready in like 10 minutes. She apologized a lot. I literally was in zero rush, and mistakes happen, so I said no worries. I paid for the pizza and a slushee since I’d be waiting and took a seat. She did ask me if I was sure I’d ordered from that Sam’s Club, and I said I was like 90% sure now... lol. 

Well, about 10 minutes later a younger guy called me up to the counter for my pizza, and he said he was the one that took my call. He apologized so much, saying it was totally his fault, he got busy after the call and forgot to start the pizza. He tried giving me a free churro, and just kept apologizing. I let him know it was completely fine. It was a Saturday night, they were busy, I was not busy or in a rush, people make mistakes... and for him to please not worry! He thanked me for being cool and said a lot of other people wouldn’t be so cool lol. I told him I 100% understood cuz I worked in customer service for MANY, MANY years."
GetMotivated,fetrb6u,t3_eqhr0b,1579378810.0,"I’m turning 32 in July, and I’m dabbling with the idea of going back to school to become a pharmacist. It’s been 10 years since I graduated with my bachelor’s degree, so I’d want to (and most likely need to) redo my bachelor’s first, so that’s eight more years of school. Very daunting... but then I figure, I’d be 40 anyway. Might as well be a pharmacist too!"
