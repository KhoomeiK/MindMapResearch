Whooping cough is a much more severe thing in humans than the common cold.  That's all i am saying. I agreed with you that they shared properties.

Edit: i agree without proper intervention kennel cough could become more severe as well."

Kids should not have phones that can access that kind of thing until an older age. A phone just for texting and phone calls is sufficient."
dogs,ffyotfi,t1_ffygbjr,1580351524.0,This is incorrect. Kennel cough and whooping cough are not the same. They have similiar organisms but whooping cough is more severe and dogs do not get it.
dogs,ffyoj1v,t3_evwmcv,1580351329.0,"The Kennel cough vaccine is not a core vaccine. Which means it's not %100 mandatory and is actually your decision based on your pet's lifestyle. 

Also, it doesn't %100 cover all the strains of kennel cough. Dogs can get kennel cough from the vaccination itself. They can also get kennel cough even if they are vaccinated against it.

It is a good idea to get it if you plan on your dog going to doggy daycares, boarding kennels, dog parks, etc. And yes, the more volume of dogs in one area makes it more likely it could happenm but an infected dog can get it from any one infected dog. Keep in mind your dog can and will likely get kennel cough in its lifetime despite being vaccinated for it. The vaccine would make it  a less severe case of it.

It's also a self limiting disease which means that if your dog was to get kennel cough, 99/100 they would not need antibitoics or medical treatment. Keeping them rested with fluids and proper
 nutrition is usually enough to make it go away on its own. It can last for 7days to a few weeks. 

It's okay to wait until your next paycheck if you keep your dog around your own house and yard."

unpopularopinion,fffl4le,t3_et9h2b,1579886312.0,"I think that there can be separate views here.
I've known dogs that were bred and raised to watch their flock. Who would rather die then leave them to be in the house. But as i said, these dogs were bred for that. Their size and agility is capable of defending itself to predators. Their coat is able to endure tough weather etc. Although these dogs have the choice to the dog house or sleeping next to the flock.

Other dogs are NOT bred to live outdoors. Nobody can tell me that a chihuahua for example, would be happier or for it to be uncruel to live outside. They cannot defend themselves to anything bigger than a field mouse and they could not endure any weather other than warm weather.

Domesticated dogs have classes in which they were bred. And many were not for being outside their whole lives. 

Even if they have a nice cozy doghouse that doesn't mean they are safe. Hell, a Bald Eagle is capable of grabbing anything as large as a West Highland Terrier as it's prey."
