The tables in the cafeteria were long and had 8 seats on a side. They could fit 4 of them lengthwise in a row. There were probably 5 or 6 rows and a few round tables scattered about.

My friends and I sat at one end of the table-chain. On the opposite end, some kids had thrown their trash under the table and kicked it towards our end.

Well the new vice principal's apparently got something to prove, so he sees trash under the tables, and comes up to the middle of the row and starts shouting about how ""disrespectful this and ungrateful that.""

I'm thinking ""yeah man, tell 'em what's up.""

Then he gave the entire row detention.

 Like 40 people.

And since it was *almost winter break*, he decided detention went on the whole week (it was either a Monday or a Tuesday).
