I experienced something similar 3-4 years ago to my(F) best friend (M) who was 3 years older than me, he was already like a brother to me. The night before he got into the accident I was in your shoes, had been thinking about him but hesitated to reach out and ask how he was doing; until it happened, he died in a vehicle accident.

You must feel very heartbroken and devastated, OP. Please know that it’s not your fault and this too shall pass. Enjoy this grieving period, cherish the moments you had had with her, how lucky you are to have met a person like her.

I hope you feel better soon! *edit: here’s a virtual hug*

P.S. Sorry if my sentences may be misleading, English is not my first language."
