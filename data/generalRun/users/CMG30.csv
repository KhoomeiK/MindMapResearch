politics,ffvvx86,t1_ffvuzsf,1580274867.0,"Crimes have nothing to do with impeachment. Impeachment is a constitutional remedy for removing a president who is acting in a way that, for lack of a better term, is doing great damage to the country.  As for the procedure the house used, this was a carbon copy of the rules Republicans put in place to impeach Bill Clinton. Why do you think Trump deserves a different set of rules?"
politics,fft0dsu,t3_eutoh5,1580200392.0,"You know that guy who says that he might actually consider voting Democrat this time if only they nominate somebody who's moderate?  Ya, well he's going to vote for Trump. Stop playing their game Democrats and nominate the best candidate for America!"

facepalm,ffplg3n,t3_eubl6i,1580097964.0,The only facepalm here is the original poster who failed to mention that many of the jets that flew to Davos this year had paid extra for carbon neutral jet fuel. Essentially ethanol from crops.

Next, they saved having to plumb the thing by tapping into the toilet drain. Even Gained a shelf. Only downside is the ugly foam."
facepalm,ffpjy91,t1_ffn4s39,1580096850.0,Washing machine. Just drains down the toilet. No hot air.
politics,ffe7a4z,t3_et0hlv,1579838604.0,"Funny how Hillary, who campaigned on breaking gender stereotypes, is trying to pigeon hole Sanders supporters as angry white guys."

politics,ff9lewm,t3_esano6,1579715460.0,"Hillary represents one faction of the Democratic party who has historically had the most control. Hillary worked for years behind the scenes to secure the nomination and the party put their thumbs on the scales to make sure she was the nominee. The fact that large sections of the Democratic members really didn't want her was of no consideration to the party. Hillary was arrogant enough to believe that she was entitled to the presidency no matter how much baggage she had and how unpopular she was. 

To that end, the party worked feverishly to make sure one of the most extreme wingnuts on the Republican side was nominated to set up the electorate with a choice of this terrible individual from the Republican side or hold your nose and vote for Hillary who is competent no matter what else you think of her. They basically tried to play chicken with the electorate and this time the electorate didn't blink. Years of the Democrats campaigning from the left then governing from the right caught up with them. Their traditional supporters in the northern blue collar states either didn't show up at the polls or voted for Trump because at least he was promising to do the thing that the Democrats say they believe in but allow Wall Street to veto again and again. Again, the Hillary took this support for granted even though the alarm bells should have been blaring since Sanders was soundly thrashing her in these areas.

Now she's still blaming Sanders for her loss.  The arrogance is astounding. Hillary and the Democrats who tipped the scales need to undertake serious introspection or they will continue to lose 'sure thing' elections."

A large percentage come to it because they were incapable of anything but a completely literal understanding of the bible. And still others go for it because they believe they're smarter than 3000 years worth of scientific discovery. Finally, others probably have some undiagnosed mental condition that predisposes them to various conspiracies. Come to think of it, basically the same nonsense that leads many folks to antivaxx..."

AskReddit,ff23x8r,t3_er6f2u,1579493127.0,Sounds good in principal but falls apart when you get into the weeds. Just wait till some governor throws all the women who've had abortions onto the list.
politics,ff1zuxb,t1_ff1hzcd,1579490079.0,The saddest part is that they're probably on medi-cade which is similar to the socialized medicine they're so afraid of.
politics,ff1zl2e,t3_er1veo,1579489882.0,"As a Canadian who works in the health care system, I will let everyone know that there is plenty of room for improvements in the Canadian system.  It's easy to become complacent because it's so easy to compare to what's going on south of the border and see how much worse things could be.  No question single payer is far, far better than the alternative but let's not stop there, we should be comparing ourselves to the best out there, not just what's next door."
WTF,fevzhxh,t3_eqip5z,1579403440.0,Looks like axle oil. I suppose that's a little better.
facepalm,fedxdyt,t3_eojl5n,1579021905.0,Flat Earthers are a great example of people who will straight up deny what their own eyes are telling them.  Relate this to topics that are debatable.  There will be people out there who are simply unconvinceable no matter what you show them.  Be able to recognize these folks when you find them.  Don't waste your time with them.  Instead focus on people who have the capability of changing their minds when shown convincing evidence.
facepalm,febe1qm,t3_eo3wun,1578957878.0,No wonder flat Earthers can't get a photo of the flying space pizza: they don't know how to build a not-rocket to escape not-gravity!

technology,fdtkwsn,t1_fdtijdl,1578718243.0,Incorrect. Deliveries from the Chinese factory to regular Chinese customers began Jan 7. This is another reason for the strong stock price. The shorts claimed it was impossible for Tesla to get this factory into production  in only a year. Tesla beat their own 'impossible' timeline.
