This explains why his appeals haven't had much luck. Can you imagine the shitstorm it would cause for the insurance company and anyone who took a payout?"

Accounting,ff55dx2,t1_ff53e6w,1579580708.0,"You need to rearrange the formula from your notes - Get used to that now, you'll have to do a lot of that in your accounting courses. From what you said you have in your notes, you're solving for the rate they use to allocate overhead, not total OH.

The allocation base can be a variety of things, but for this particular question they've told you they use dlh.

They spent $108 on labour for that job, paying $12/hr. They allocate overhead at $14 per direct labour hour. As the earlier poster said, the total cost is DM + DL + OH.

Sometimes thinking about cost accounting a little bit more logically can be helpful. If you were running a business, what's the way of doing this that makes sense to you? It's honestly much less abstract than financial accounting, try to think in real world terms.

For question 2, imagine that Job A-500 was a job to make two exceedingly fancy hats. You would split the cost of manufacturing between those two units.  If Job A-500 instead made 40 much less fancy hats, how much of the manufacturing cost would be assigned to each one of those hats (assuming it's an average split)?"

""Meereen. The mere word probably makes you groan. It’s considered to be the weakest, most frustrating plotline in ADWD, and perhaps in in the whole series. It’s thought to be where GRRM lost the plot and spent endless chapters on pointless filler. The solutions seem so obvious, the villains seem obviously evil one-dimensional caricatures. And many fans see it as the plotline that ruined Dany’s character, revealing her to be a naive, incompetent, lovesick girl.

I used to agree with all of those criticisms — but I’ve come to believe that they’re all actually quite wrong. In these essays I’ll debunk them. After a reread (or several), and much productive discussion on various forums, I now firmly believe that ADWD is the smartest, most complex, and most thought-provoking book in the series. It is very carefully constructed, yet quite subtle and therefore rewarding of rereads, close analysis, and an effort to engage. In particular, the Meereen plotline is quite ingeniously constructed by Martin to mislead fans in certain ways. Often, the truth there is the opposite of what it appears on the surface.""

Maybe winds is taking so long because GRRM is out there writing essays to respond to internet criticisms."

Don't stress :)

I finished my education a while ago and I've been a billing/general accounting clerk at a legal firm for about 8 months. You will not need to use much of what you learned in school. It will be helpful in getting a view of WHY you are doing what you are, but in terms of the technicalities, you won't be lost. (As long as they arent awful at training)

Best of luck!"
AskReddit,fc4chnr,t1_fc3jzb5,1577412688.0,I appreciate that. It's been 2 months since the last breakup and this one was for keeps. Starting to get better now. But that sounds very similar to my relationship too. I am also around if you want to talk :)
