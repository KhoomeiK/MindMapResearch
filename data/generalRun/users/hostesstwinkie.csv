Is vaping bad for you?  I think the general consensus is yes, but it's less bad than traditional smoking.

As to why, that really depends on a lot of factors.  The temperature of the coil, the type of chemicals and their concentrations present in the ""juice"", frequency of use etc.  Any number of chemicals can undergo changes when heated on their own or in the presence of other chemicals.  These chemicals are then vaporized and brought into contact with lung tissue.  Many of them are harmless, but some of them could cause temporary or permanent tissue damage.  This damage could very well be cumulative.  At this point, we don't have enough historical data to say for sure what and how much damage is being done."
