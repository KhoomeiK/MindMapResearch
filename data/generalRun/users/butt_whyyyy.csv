TattooRemoval,ffnlz50,t1_ffnl7t5,1580067652.0,Aah... found it. Thanks a lot! I'll ask him if it's the same like in the US. Thank you!

TattooRemoval,ffnfdrn,t3_euavvr,1580065277.0,"It's really cute, sad you're not satisfied.
My laser technician uses a picosure and says there's no tattoo which can't be removed, it's just a matter of sessions which can be more for yellow."

SuicideWatch,ff8hg3a,t1_ff86qt0,1579678653.0,"I think we prefer the same thing. In Belgium it's okay for people with mental illnesses. The problem is you need insurance there. In Switzerland it's hecking expensive. (From what I've heard) a bummer....
(If this comment is inappropriate i'm sorry and you're welcome to delete it.)"
SuicideWatch,ff73mpb,t3_es07op,1579640457.0,"Totally understand. I just get it occasionally, but it's sort of normal, like what do i want to eat tomorrow? Oh look, i could just jump in front of that train! Did I lock the door?

It may be a stretch but I think it's kind of a comfort to know there's always a way out if it gets too hard, even when that comfort is just in the back of your head...helps you hang in a little longer.."
Botchedsurgeries,ff10udq,t3_eqxp5z,1579474112.0,Is this a permanent thing or are you able to reverse it?
depression,ff0x6hf,t3_eqwbwa,1579473157.0,Soo true. I'm struggling with university so much...I know i could handle all the work it's just so exhausting and hard to maintain any concentration. I used to be so smart and now I feel so dumb and useless.... depression is killing every sense of ambition.

SuicideWatch,fdodve7,t1_fdodltx,1578603323.0,"I agree with that service part, no question. But exchanging anything sexual with someone who's not your partner (if you have one) is cheating. So why is it not ok for his gf to be mad?"

Don't know about the head, tho. Been also wondering... ><"
depression,fcml19o,t3_ehuxug,1577779702.0,"Totally on your side there. Dog owner who can't drive. 
Just waiting for her to go, so there's nothing to hold on to anymore. 
She's super cute but started to bite and freaks out from time to time. It's not that I don't wanna help her, I already contacted someone professional, but it's draining - more than I hoped for. It's exhausting.
Your dog can be happy that you take care of him/her. There are far too many people who treat their pets like garbage."
SuicideWatch,fclip9b,t3_ehonx2,1577748710.0,Can relate so hard... my birthday was last friday and all I felt was guilt..
depression,fc3rmkj,t1_fc3d2d4,1577396882.0,"You hit the nail on the head.
When I was asked what I wanted for christmas, my answer was a bullet between my eyes.

Everyone around me is so fed up with this kind of humour, but it's the only way to bear it all. It is indeed a coping mechanism. 

Stay Strong!"
