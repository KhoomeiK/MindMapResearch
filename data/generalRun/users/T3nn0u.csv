gaming,ffgtgde,t3_eteqnp,1579914623.0,"Would love to buy 2 sets for 2 of my most used consoles(x360 and ps4).
Im ready to pay even 20€/set(+postages) if i can get them like yours, and in black. :)"

simracing,ffbb2f4,t1_ffba30k,1579758094.0,"Surprisingly i havent noticed anything major, gas pedal had a hiccup once but it went away by itself. As in at max throttle+slight force, like you would be driving with adrenaline, it went apeshit. But it stopped doing that few days later, i am quite smooth with my pedals(heard this from one pro driver from same series back in gt6 days, i was the jumboholder mostly, i.e last) so i suppose they havent had too much abuse, i drive pretty much all sorts of cars, drift,rally,gt etc. You name it, so it has had hundreds of hours of use, probably closer to 2k hours as i bought the set used(the pedals are from the 2nd set, got 'em ~4-5years ago? Cant remember exactly)"
simracing,ffb9zas,t1_ffb9feg,1579756769.0,":c thats sad, but obvious part of simracing(with a tad older, but still good gear) I just hope your servo lasts. I went through 2 of 'em, first one blew its main motor(one with pcb) and second one worked but i bought a t300rs and used the pedals, as they were working(and better than the stock ones that come with t300, no clutch-ones) pedals have served me for years now and i fear for them to break, as im too poor for an upgrade now."
simracing,ffb4fxj,t3_esehw3,1579751529.0,"Holy shit, thats beautifully done. Very much respect for having a shitload of patience!(based on your other comments,10h dremeling etc).
I hope your G27 serves you long! :)"
HumansBeingBros,ff6meoq,t3_eoz1ui,1579630303.0,"I have had similar experience, altho in fb. I joined one group focusing on ambient music(i do make music myself but have been unable to complete my projects for a year now), and i was shocked to see Lauge in the group. In one of his posts i commented that his song ""Daybreak"" gave me the igniting spark to compose my own music ~10years ago, i almost died and literally cried when he reacted to my comment with a heart and responded to it. I cannot remember what he said, but we had a short convo(few comments, lots of text)where i wholeheartedly thanked him for inspiring me.

One of the moments in my life i will NEVER forget"
