quantum,ff1apdj,t1_fezser0,1579476879.0,"You're mixing things a little here, like imagining a point particle turning into a wave that has to interfere with itself. It's not quite like that. 

Think of flipping a coin. When you see if it's heads or tails, that's your measurement. And we know the probability distribution for that, it's a simple binomial distribution, 50/50. No need for a complex wave function.

The coin never *becomes* the distribution, but still will always come up heads or tails. So the distribution in some way says something important about the nature of a coin: a coin has two sides. If you flip it 100 times, you'll likely get around 50 of each. NOT because the coin knows anything about probabilities, but because of its nature, it's qualities. The distribution is like a comment on that, even a proof of that.

Now consider a particle. Understand that the word ""particle"" is just a placeholder -- it's not a little ball. We don't know what it is, it's just something about which we've been able to observe certain behaviors, make certain measurements. We can't see it, like we can a dog. It's not quite an object, but something.

When we measure it, like we measure the coin, we can speak about probabilities of our seeing it here or there. The quantum mechanical distribution is more complex, and can be modeled by a wave function -- and that function tells you the probability that you'll detect a particle in a particular place. 

The wave function is a mathematical model used track what we label as, e.g., photons, electrons, or anything else that we can model as a particle, and tell us the precise probability that it will be in a certain place in the future. It cannot tell us exactly where it will be, as if it were a solid, independent, *real* particle, but neither is its location or speed totally random.

But this is important. It means that these ""things"" we label, e.g., photons, electrons, atoms, chickens, people, are not actually ""things"" in the way that they *appear* to us. They *appear* that way, true -- but quantum mechanics shows that that apparent solidity is merely an approximation. 

In a sense, this is quantum mechanics' *comment* about the nature of the particle: It's not an independent, solid, self-existent *real* particle. (But: neither is it totally imaginary. *Something* is there. The model just does not say what it is.)

Except for QBism folks, people don't like to hear this and don't want to know this, because it is psychologically threatening. This, I feel, is the underlying reason that, after 100 years, this fact has not been digested by physicists or the general public.

If course what we all want to know is, if the ""particle"" is merely an approximation, then what is *really* there?

Some physicists, Sean Carroll of late, strongly push the idea of a Multiverse. This is because, imho, they simply cannot abide with what quantum mechanics implies, and so rather than entertain the idea that things are not real in the way they appear, prefer to believe that gazillions of additional real worlds are generated each picosecond. Rather than face emptiness, stuff the world to the gills with more worlds.

This move does allow one to sidestep the ""wave collapse"" problem via the idea that it need never collapse -- but with the unfortunate side effect of infinitely branching worlds, all of them ""real"". 

Much easier, to me, is simply to recognize that the wave never ""collapses"" because it never has to. The wave is merely a mathematical model of a probability distribution. That's a simple fact. It's not reality! It's just a model used to explain the data. 

What do we measure, when we measure? We measure attributes according to some model we have in mind. Or we make measurements, and we come up with a model to explain them. In no case is the model ever the Reality. This is the key point: models are not Reality. They do not tell us what Reality IS. They only model it.

What is Reality then? That's a profound question. We could inquire into that if you want."
quantum,fezsneh,t1_few5ebz,1579461139.0,"This is precisely the problem. These two models, of a wave and a particle, just don't fit together. And yet, both are needed to describe what we, in fact, see.

Does it make sense to say that a photon starts as a particle, as a photon, and then becomes a wave in transit, and then becomes a photon again upon arrival?

That implies that unless we measure it, it is spread throughout the universe as a wave. It implies that the moon, as the object, *moon*, is not there unless you look at it. Einstein was understandably perturbed about this idea, but he could not come up with a solution."
quantum,feziiw6,t1_few75i5,1579457711.0,"You cannot imagine how a single photon can ""interfere with itself"" because such a thing is unimaginable. In mathematical physics, particles are modeled as points, and a mathematical point does not, could not, interfere with itself -- makes no sense at all. So that model is wrong to use here.

Which means that *that* way of trying to explain what we see, is fundamentally misguided, and you will not be able to attain a clear picture of what is happening -- this is exactly what has bedeviled physicists for a century.

The wave function, as a probability distribution, does not solve this problem. It tells us the likelihood that a mathematical point will appear in a certain place, *once we measure*.

It's a probability distribution -- it gives no picture, none, about what is there. A picture of a wave is intuitive, we understand that from our experience with water, but again in this case it is a model of probabilities, not *things*, not even fluids. Not energies, not ""pilot waves"", whatever those could be made of.

Modeling particles as points is helpful as a model, but in reality, no thing that we know of lacks extension. We live in 3 dimensions, not 1. Yes it works, spectacularly well, in making mechanical predictions about what 3D objects do, because objects can be modeled as their centers. But it's a gross simplification. I'm not my center of mass, but that will work fine if you shoot me out of a cannon.

Quantum mechanics, however, reveals the limit of that model.

We see *things*. We have the idea that they exist just like that, as *things*. But we're not sure -- we want to know *what is really there*. We want to *picture it*. 

Of course we do. Quantum mechanical experiments say: ""No. You get no picture, now or ever."" You can model it, but the math will not tell you what it is.

It's tough isn't it? :)"

I think that's a very good place to be, because you are seeing your limit at the same time you have a wish to benefit.

This is the practice of aspiration bodhicitta. Tonglen or similar practice is ideal.

I would suggest that those ways of viewing time are available to us right now, though they're a bit hidden. I don't think we're actually imprisoned by seconds and minutes, etc., but rather we have a society built around these concepts.

I think we have more flexibility, right now, in how we experience time, than we think. If we're bored, a minute can seem endless. But is it? It's just a perception. If we're happy and engaged, we have no thought of time.

What's ""eternal"", really? What does the word actually point to as an experience? One might think that it's like the bored minute stretched endlessly, but could that be true? So far, that minute had always changed into something else.

I think, whatever eternal actually is, we can already taste it right in this present moment, not as the fast, fleeting present, but as a relaxed spaciousness that doesn't have any boundary.

From the movie's perspective, this is related to the inseparability of past, present and future, the mixing of them. And we already taste that -- just not as fully as the aliens!

I feel like the next step is a challenging one. How to be in the world? Being ""out"" or ""above"" might be too disconnected (depending on how it feels, not the words).

Apeirophobia,fc6c6nl,t1_fc3kmn2,1577477155.0,"Interesting, I was raised Catholic too, but became a Buddhist 20+ years ago. I don't remember exactly when I had my first infinity-fear episode, but had a childhood friend die of a brain tumor when I was 11 or so and think it was happening by then. I'd had OCD-ish symptoms back then too, checking the lock on the door repeatedly before bed, arranging everything on my dresser in exact lines, needing the light to click off just right as I exited the bathroom or life just didn't feel right.

I was able to get over the OCD stuff myself, just by forcing myself to stop those behaviors, but I think the doubting quality of that syndrome, which yearns unsuccessfully for something to *feel finished or complete*, fits strangely well with apeirophobia. 

Later on in college I started having panic attacks related to a failed relationship and just the feeling of groundlessness of my total life situation, and those felt quite similar to the earlier attacks, and were ramping up in frequency. For a while there I was completely desperate, even with good parental support, though they didn't understand. I got into psychotherapy, which started letting some steam off, and eventually got on Clonazepam, though I resisted that a while, and it calmed my system down enough that I could stay in school and start digging my way out. After a few years I could give up the meds.

My path with this whole thing has been long, with many turns. I ended up getting a Master's degree in Counseling and also eventually found my way into Buddhism and meditation, where I've found the clearest understanding (for me). Sometimes it's good to have a very powerful opponent, because such an opponent forces you to grow and work hard in ways you never would otherwise.

That you've found that helping others is key, I think is wonderful. When apeiro happens to us, it's as if merely thinking in a certain direction could give rise to a tornado that will carry us away. It takes away some fundamental feeling of safety about the world, some unspoken feeling that everything will be alright somehow, eventually. 

Because of that, I think we have to relearn how to ground ourselves. There are many many ways to do that-- running, smelling the Earth and lying on the grass, looking closely at objects all around. Even more powerful is grounding ourselves by connecting to other people, giving or receiving help, sharing, especially physical  contact like holding hands, hugging, etc. This subreddit is also that grounding."

So basically, unless they have personal or clinical experience with this, they're likely to be a bit mystified."
Apeirophobia,fc0wndj,t1_f8rd8m9,1577301656.0,"I like how you're relating to this. I like how apeirophobia demonstrates a sort of ""no-go"" place for conceptuality. 

We have the idea that there are some things that may be too difficult for us to grasp, but this reaction is so visceral that I can't help but think that humanity has a number of defense mechanisms built in, and philosophies that arise out of an unconscious attempt to lessen the stress of this thought. It's so suppressed that most people don't even encounter it. But it can teach us a lot about the limit of thought."
Apeirophobia,fc0cisv,t3_cug1hg,1577286892.0,This is a lovely refection.
Apeirophobia,fc0btwu,t1_fbz3hqf,1577286255.0,"I'd go even further, the lack of boundary both in front and behind can make a subtle change in feeling which can feel quite spacious, like sitting in an open field. The exact reverse of the claustrophobic apeirophobic thought. And then that thought seems easier to see as it is, stuck in a moment (and you can't get out of it, sang U2)."
Apeirophobia,fburg1s,t3_eeej4r,1577119174.0,"These are really nice tips, thank you. I would just want to add that there can come a time when you are no longer afraid of this thought, but rather welcome it -- even if, as in my case, the thought is mostly, but not totally drained of its painful power. (The strange thing is that I don't quite want it to be gone until it has taught me everything it's here to teach me.) 

One can find that it actually is one of your teachers about life. At that point it can start feeling like a gift and not a torture. That's my experience, and what I wish for everyone who is suffering from it."
