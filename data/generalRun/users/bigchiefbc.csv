I know of one particular scenario that I'd be very surprised that you haven't unlocked yet if you're almost done with the campaign >!Scenario 72 has that enemy and is unlocked in the Town Records once you've retired one character and reached prosperity 4.!<
Gloomhaven,ff6cthd,t1_ff5jlhc,1579624400.0,It's not so much a matter of the decks being so good that x2s makes it worse.  There are definitely a couple classes that are so dependent on their modifier decks pulling specific cards often that extra x2s might dilute it more than wanted.

Gloomhaven,fdkwsee,t3_elo75d,1578512770.0,"I think people are really underselling the Diviner.  She's tricky, and a lot of the things she does are powerful but subtle.   Her deck manipulation abilities can ensure that your allies are doing a ton of damage and basically never miss.  She can fill the enemy deck with curses, and then make sure that the enemy draws them.  She can make sure that certain enemy abilities don't come up.  She can bless allies, give them shields, give them regen.  If you're solely focused on attacks, then yes, she's weak until level 7, and doesn't reach her full potential until level 9.

I'd say that it's probably a good idea to wait until at least level 3 and possibly level 5 until starting her, both because that will give you time to get really experienced in the game, and also she has significant power bumps at those levels.  I also definitely recommend that you play her a bit before starting the FC scenarios.  I went into FC without any experience with her and struggled at first until I learned how to play her."

We immediately saw that if you rush right up to the group of enemies and stay next to them, there are no open spaces for them to summon into. And each of the initial enemies you kill leave a coin that will also block the summons. You just need to be able to withstand the damage for a few rounds. Diviner has multiple cards that can provide allies with shields, and 2 of the other characters have the ability to shield as well. So we just parked ourselves in front of the cultists and tanked while hacking away, and the Diviner curse bombed.

When we got to the second room, we split up into two teams, the Brute and Tinkerer taking the group closer to the door, and 3 Spears and Diviner dashing to the back of the room to take on the farther group."
Gloomhaven,fdgpx0y,t1_fdgpqp3,1578405206.0,"Sure, that makes sense for effects that wear off like Stun, Disarm, Immobilize, Muddle.  But Poison and Wound don't have a duration.  They are there until the enemy dies or heals, in which case the status effect is gone."
Gloomhaven,fdgpl30,t1_fdgpelf,1578404936.0,"But if you try to wound an enemy that's already wounded, then doesn't it simply have no effect?

Gloomhaven,fdgp2r3,t1_fdgg3pc,1578404521.0,"Yeah, I never personally understood why the game assumes it's so hard to remember who applied a wound.  If your team is that forgetful, you could put one of your little character tokens on it,"

Gloomhaven,fdf5r69,t3_ekvhwv,1578353936.0,"I guess it depends on what kind of Eclipse build you're planning on going for.  I sympathize with your teammates if you're going for the most optimal build of Eclipse, because I found that being on a team with that class played that way sucked all of the fun out of the game for me, and almost made me stop wanting to play.  Not only did the executes make almost every scenario trivial, the constant invisibility made it so that the other three of us had the sole job of just sitting there and taking damage while Eclipse murdered everything.  

Stamina potions are stupidly powerful.  I'd say doing the standard nerf of 1 less card and making them non-recoverable is a good start to at least somewhat stopping them from completely breaking the game.

Personally I think executes should go away, and I'm glad to hear they will in Frosthaven.  And just constantly being invisible puts a ton of pressure on your teammates to take all of the aggro.

As for your team, I'd say that you need to talk to them, find out which parts of Eclipse they find most objectionable, and maybe try to steer away from that type of build."

Gloomhaven,fc8ps0j,t3_egqfmz,1577539763.0,"My group is about 8-9 scenarios into Forgotten Circles, and I'm playing the Diviner.  The one thing I wish I'd done different is to play the Diviner a bit before starting Forgotten Circles.  The first few scenarios with the Diviner in FC felt a bit constraining because they seemed to be set up to require the Diviner to do specific things, which prevented me from really getting a feel to how the Diviner plays in a ""normal"" scenario.  I feel I'm just now getting the hang of her."
space,fc7iosp,t1_fc7iiz2,1577508648.0,Doesn't it have to?  The energy from fusion and force of the gravity have to precisely match for a star to stay in any sort of coherent equilibrium.  I was always under the impression that it keeps collapsing until there is enough fusion energy to exactly counterbalance the gravity.
space,fc7hw77,t1_fc7hj59,1577507941.0,"Right, but each of those ""cessation of fusion"" periods between element-burning stages is very quick, like a matter of seconds.  A star can't go longer than that without fusion to balance against the gravity.  This dimming has been steadily increasing for over a month.  That just seems like far too long of a process for it to have anything to do with core collapse."
space,fc7epgd,t1_fc7bcv0,1577505204.0,"IIRC, once a star of Betelgeuse's mass starts fusing Silicon (pretty much the last step before Iron) in its core, that Silicon will last less than a day before it's mostly Iron, which is the end.  Once there is little or no fusion happening in the core, the star explodes in a matter of seconds.  I think the observed dimming is way too stretched out in this case to signal the cessation of fusion."
