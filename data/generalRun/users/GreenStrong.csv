But it is not a low- IQ hunting method.  Prey animals sprint away and hide, the hunter has to be able to interpret many different signs of the prey, actual footprints aren't always visible. They routinely make educated guesses based on their observations of prey.  The hunter stands where the last tracks were seen, mimics the body movements of the prey, and goes in the direction the animal would choose; it is predatory empathy.

Speilrein was a Russian Jew, whose transference during analysis led to her falling in love with Jung, and creating a belief that she was destined to have a child with him that was to be named Seigfreid, who would be the savoir of humanity by merging the German and Jewish races.  The affair apparently took place after he had talked her down from the heights of this belief.  Sabina Speilrein was murdered in the Holocaust, a macabre echo of her fantasy.

Ultimately, Jung believed that the meaning of life came from religion, but that Western religion had grown stale in the light of our new modes of thinking.  Dreams are a portal to the mind that creates new symbols with religious meaning.   Jung regarded it as somewhat of a curse to live in times when we have to find these meanings for ourselves."

Our other major source of Buddhism is Zen, which exists in harmony with Shinto shamanistic practices, but we only get the minimalism of pure Zen.

Von Franz is similar, I think the image is showing this experience is beyond gender.   It would be easy enough to assume that whichever one is the same gender as the dreamer is the Self, and the other is the Anima/ Animus, but I'm inclined to read it as two aspects of a single hermaphroditic figure of wisdom.

In addition to the symbolism of Jung and von Franz, there is an element of lucidity here, it is a dream about dream analysis, it is about gaining understanding and consciousness.  In my experience of ""Big dreams"", including the ones with Jung, they're what Andrew Holocek called ""hyper- lucid"", even though they're not ""lucid dreams"" in the usual sense that you're aware of the fact that you are dreaming.  Greater consciousness is present.

You need to consider what was going on in the USSR in WWII.  Start out with a nation bigger than most continents, which has forcibly assimilated people like Chechens and Siberian natives who don't speak Russian.  They began building a centrally organized government and economy in the 1917 revolution, but their communication, transportation, and even literacy are far below any European nation at the beginning of the Soviet era.  By the end of 1945, they will have lost *twenty million people* including civilians.

Things were disorganized.  You graduate from tank school, get assigned to a tank unit, hop on a train, get to the depot, and your commanding officer is dead, all of the tanks are destroyed, and no one knows which unit got the orders and billets for that company.  They want to assign you to a mine clearing company, but you show them your papers, and they put you in the pipeline to join the next tank platoon that gets put together.

In 1945, Soviet units weren't being consumed that way, but the system of organizing men and resources was put together in 1941.  The Red Army lost about a million men per month from June- December of 1941.  They didn't have a sophisticated system for allocating troops, if you had a piece of paper that said you were Ivan and you drove tanks, they would try to put you in a tank, God help you."

This brings up a larger issue- this is *short term relationship, outside of any community context*.

We need to develop skilled guides for local psychedelic retreats, with all kinds of substances.  Almost every ecosystem can grow local plants that will form an ayahuasca analogue.  But within the tradition, true ayahuasca is a sentient being who speaks with the wisdom of the vast Amazon.  Many people who have gone there skeptical of this come home believing it.

ICC profiles are the translation system.  ICC profiles make it possible to display an image in multiple media, and have it look the same.  For example, film studios do color grading on high quality monitors, for output on projectors in theaters- if there is a display profile for each device, they will match.

In print, the ICC profile translates between the screen and the output device.  But the Epson profiles that are installed with your printer are specific to epson ink.  You need to get a profile that is specific to your printer, and your ink set.

If you were doing really high end color matching, you would use a custom profile for your printer, ink, substrate, and temperature, and you would also measure and adjust the color on your monitor.

I read a bit on psychedelic therapy, and I listen to the Psychedlics Today podcast, which is hosted by two people who offer educational courses in psychedelics for mental health professionals.  I would say that many, possibly most professional psychedelic guides have some familiarity with Jung's work.  Actual analysis is a very particular technique, and the process to master it takes a huge amount of education.  It often takes many months, sometimes years.  There will never be enough purely Jungian analysis to treat the number of PTSD victims that exist.

Excellent book on psychedelics is Michael Pollan's *How to Change Your Mind*.  The author is possibly the world's most recognized writer of mainstream science books, he steps out of the mainstream for this, and writes something that is incredibly understandable, dense with information, but easy to understand.  The author takes a few trips with underground guides, he describes the process of finding and evaluating them.  The book is an overview of the whole subject, with quite a bit of history, but the history makes it understandable why they went out of professional practice and into the underground. (Timothy Leary played a huge role, it might have been different if not for him).  An audio version is available, and it is a New York Times best seller, so any library will have a few copies.

The suggestion about MAPS is excellent, but they fund research studies, which by nature only involve a few people.
