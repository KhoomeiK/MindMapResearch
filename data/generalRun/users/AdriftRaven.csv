I think that a major problem I have is that I kind of rushed through the refeeding process with a therapist that only seemed to unfairly judge me for having an eating disorder. I was in nursing school at the time and completely terrified of having to go to inpatient treatment. Fear probably isn't the best motivation to overcome an ED :/ 

Anyway, why I asked was my thoughts are probably the exact same as when I was at my lowest, I just have better coping skills thanks to my new, amazing therapist.  I know I need to keep working, but I guess it's nice to know that other people have lingering thoughts."
AskReddit,ff5piyt,t1_ff59d4w,1579604804.0,"Quick question, so when you say you beat yours, do you mean that you no longer having ED thoughts or that you no longer have those behaviors? I've been able to maintain a healthy weight for a year and a half now but I still struggle daily with the disordered thoughts. I'm just curious if those will ever go away."

The accurate disclosure of risk factors helps decrease exposure to contaminated blood products."
todayilearned,ff2fdh3,t1_ff22q77,1579503803.0,"I imagine that they did not want patients to fear contracting HIV through surgery, thus preventing life-saving procedures. Contracting HIV through donated blood products is an exceedingly rate [occurrence](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5941a3.htm)."
todayilearned,ff2f6qa,t1_ff2dpty,1579503590.0,"According to this [report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5941a3.htm) from the CDC, transmission of HIV through donated blood products results from donors failing to disclose known risk factors.

Asimov contracting HIV from a surgery has literally nothing to do with the surgeons. They most likely wanted to keep this quiet as they did not want to spread panic and mistrust among the general patient population."
todayilearned,fdayk2v,t1_fdaljih,1578251826.0,"I am absolutely not just saying that and I don't have inferiority complex. Read the rest of that sentence. The role that nurses have was much more appealing to me while also allowing me to have a life outside of work.

I have a twin brother that is in medical school. My decision to be a nurse was a personal one and had nothing to do with intelligence. That is all that I was saying. I respect physicians and completely understand that they are much more knowledgeable about medicine. My entire point was that their training does give the occasional physician the right to treat the nursing staff like shit."
todayilearned,fd7xmm1,t1_fd6xgrq,1578211544.0,"Nurses absolutely do not blindly follow policy. In fact, when one of us does do that, we let them know that isn't how it's supposed to be done and they need to actually use their critical thinking. And, admittedly, they will get shit talked for making that mistake."

GetMotivated,fchwqif,t1_fcgj47j,1577655041.0,"People aren't typically admitted to psych wards for depression treatment. Admission generally happens when you are a deemed a danger to yourself or others. 

The goal of treatment at a psych ward is to get the patient's mental state stabilized. Some depression treatment does occur, but it is not the goal of treatment."
