What you might be perceiving as ignorance may just be his lack of knowledge on how to handle things. His lack of interacting with you for a couple days on end may be either due to you not initiating anything or you being clingy. As a relatively introverted person, I feel that when you push someone to make a decision, you corner them and the result is worse than the beginning. You have to balance your requests with nurture, because they can’t learn how to foster a relationship without being taught"
