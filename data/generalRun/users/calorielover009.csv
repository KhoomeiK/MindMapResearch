offmychest,ff6em2o,t3_ern6z8,1579625519.0,"I have been in the same situation right now. It started gradually since our group kind of split apart, e.g. different classes in school. Before we used to know each other's personal life, but now I just feel like i don't exist to them. Which is why I decided to cut them off - not referring to them as my close friends anymore. We still see one another at school, but I'm just being civil to them. I don't initiate conversations anymore because it is bullshit to me, and I hate bullshits."
