LifeProTips,fdsnx81,t1_fdsfheq,1578705679.0,"No. It's more than that. Declawing a cat is animal abuse and ILLEGAL in a lot of state. It decreases their life spans and causes LOTS of health problems. ***Edit***: for the people who say that they have an old healthy cat. Fantastic.  Did you know that just because one animal survived abuse well doesnt mean that all will react the same? Did you know that it is also the equivalent to removing a human's first two knuckles in their fingers? Just to put it into perspective for you.  And that's just some physical repercussions. Declawing has been proven to have negative effects on the cats mental health
