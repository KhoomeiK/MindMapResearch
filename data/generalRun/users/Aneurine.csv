nutrition,fec84kc,t1_feb2rb6,1578968304.0,"Sure, in terms of their stability though, they're all going to be less prone to oxidation and rancidity than fatty acids that are unsaturated. I'd think that's something you could group them by that makes sense?"

nutrition,fe4a2m7,t3_enjlbk,1578857228.0,"I really appreciate your question and bringing this up for discussion. 

Can anyone provide sources or refute the following, I'd like to take a more critical look at and reevaluate my ""beliefs"" or get more sources to support them:

- Older studies did not distinguish between saturated and artificial trans fatty acids, which had a large part to play in findings and recommendations against saturated fat. 

- causes of death prior to WW2 showed very little heart disease (or cancer) and this was before much seed derived vegetable oil was around and tallow, lard, coconut oil, olive oil, poultry fat, butter were mostly used.

- The fatty acid structure - the more unsaturated, the more reactive, the more free radical generation, the more potential for cell damage in our bodies.

- The essential fatty acid LA in particular has an essential intake above which it is just increasing need for omega 3 fatty acids to balance it (themselves even less desirable above essential needs as they're even more reactive) with excess LA leading to a cat chasing tail situation where it becomes difficult to achieve the optimal 3:6 ratios, making it desirable to limit LA intake and therefore meaning you by default end up eating more MUFA and SFAs or carbs for calories instead in your avoidance of excess LA, which would seem to be more important from a reactivity and cell damage p.o.v than avoiding SFAs. Logically you'd choose MUFAs but they usually in most natural fats come with too much LA still to emphasize too much.

- Women with high LDL live longer and suffer less strokes and saturated fats usually raise HDL as well as LDL ...negating effects of LDL anyway?

I also think they shouldn't waste the culled animals, that should be our meat source, not CAFO meat..

nutrition,fdq7wy8,t1_fdoklf2,1578658591.0,"Nah, they just got craftier. I think they're allowed without labelling up to 2%. In addition products with mono & diglycerides can be hiding trans fatty acids. Technically they're not trans fats in that they're not 3 fatty acids on a glycerol backbone. And those who do remove trans fats often substitute with palm oil. Which is awful re environment and human health. Happy to see evidence contrary to what I've said if anyone thinks I have these things wrong."
australia,fdifq0c,t1_fdhdwpf,1578441874.0,"When I looked up Eucalyptus tereticornis at https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/species-search/?class=&family=&kingdom=plants&species=Eucalyptus+tereticornis it showed many crosses and subspecies, including a cross with the Sydney blue gum E. Saligna. So local seed is probably the wtg."
australia,fdifejy,t1_fdhmwgi,1578441667.0,"Was it eucalyptus tereticornis?

I'm not sure which ""blue gum"" was being used but Syntropic farming uses them to good avail - actually using them like living pumps to cycle water to more shallow rooted plants - released when they pollard them.  I guess that requires the lopping of the leaves and management though."

australia,fdi97kd,t1_fdg6x9y,1578437996.0,"There are over 700 species of ""gum trees"" and their flammability actually varies wildly. Even the same species in a different locale and conditions can vastly change its flammability. Some are actually quite fire retardant which is contrary to popular belief. Another thing that affects their dangerousness is whether they have flaky or stringy bark or whether it is smooth. 

Having said that I wouldn't want to risk planting them near my house as it seems too hard to know in given conditions. Many European trees are more fire retardant choices for within 100m of a house (still not against windows, reaching over a house, or touching it), even stifling embers that fell amongst the leaves (I wouldn't rely on that though - our fires have been crazy) and also plum trees in particular are pretty great. 

I would like to plant some blue gums on my property and I've heard there's a place growing trees for koalas in Byron Bay so I'll get some from there if I can and post the link if I find it again.

I really love gum trees, I grew up with a giant magnificent  lemon scented gum in my backyard which made beautiful honey - although it crystallised pretty quickly and the tree itself dropped many limbs. I've got strawberry gum, lemon scented gum and apple gum and I've just raised some yellow box and cider gum from seed. I'm surprised the cider gum is surviving but I probably won't be able to tap it for syrup like they can in Tassie due to climate. 

Given the effect on our farmland and food supply of the drought and fires maybe any non natives we plant should be mostly food producing..."

""Morrison also fought running battles with Tourism Australia’s nine-strong board. Its members complained that he did not heed advice, withheld important research data about the controversial campaign, was aggressive and intimidating, and ran the government agency as if it were a one-man show. But Morrison thought he had the upper hand. Confident that John Howard would ultimately back him, Morrison reportedly boasted that if Fran Bailey got in his way, he would bring her down. When board members called for him to go, however, Bailey agreed, and soon it was Morrison who was on his way. “Fran despised him,” says an industry insider. “Her one big win was ousting Scott. His ego went too far.”
