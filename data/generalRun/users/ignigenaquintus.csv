facepalm,fezb92o,t1_fey72j2,1579455618.0,"That’s the excuse, but as you can see in this case this isn’t how it is used, because if you are male then it can be mansplaining the moment someone accuse you of mansplaining. In this case they were discussing the issue, so it is impossible that they already knew the answer they were looking for, it was them who engage in preconception based on him being male rather than him assuming they knew less than him about the issue without good reason.

All this stuff is also very subjective, like how you know a man being condescending to a woman wouldn’t have been equally (or perhaps even more) condescending to a man in the same situation? You can’t, therefore the proof of it being mansplaining rests completely in what the accuser assumes about the other person, and what it assumes about the other person based on that other person being a man. So the proof is implied in the accusation, no defense is possible according with the logic embedded in the concept, if you accuse someone of it then you believe the accusation grants you legitimacy in your status of victim, by the sheer fact of feeling a victim. And all this is if in fact there was condescending behavior involved, like someone can feel somebody is being condescending to him/her but that not being the case, like for example the case OP brought.


It is simply a 100% sexist (misandrist) term, like “toxic masculinity” and all those new terms that although are behaviors everybody can do somehow some people believe we need new words for when men do them, but not when female do them. Like toxicity exists irrespective of gender, condescending behavior too, occupying more than 1 space in public transport too, etc... And the worst thing about it is that the excuse, the justification for singling out men’s bad behavior is the most biased and sexist BS you could think of, the excuse is that “it is systemic”, meaning men are supposed to do it all time, in numbers apparently so above females that they deserve being called out for their gender, the bad gender, the one that gets associated with all the bad stuff and reprehensible behavior."
facepalm,fez927l,t1_fexqpcg,1579454979.0,"Exactly this, these people are dangerous to speak to, you have to accept their attitude and leave the premises fast before you find something on media smearing your name for whatever imaginary crime, he has nothing to gain with that interaction and a lot to lose."
MurderedByWords,feyhwu5,t3_eqjlha,1579445810.0,"In what world is this “murdered by words”, this is the old logical fallacy of accusing the persons that hold opinions you disagree with of being bad persons, and of course any kind of defense by the accused will be answered with a “of course you say so, because that’s what a bad person (in this case racist) would say”, and then some sort of defense of post censorship based in “people should be responsable of what they say”, despite that being a defense only of the freedom of expression of the persons that hold opinions that are the majority opinion in society, just the opposite of the reason why the freedom of expression is a right, which is to foster, to promote sharing the impopular opinions, because without them there is no social dialogue. 

This is using the minimum group theory to silence any opposition to your ideological narrative, and imo, this shows a clear authoritarian tendency that contrary to its objective only generates polarization and radicalization at the other side of the political spectrum and superficiality. The only advantage it has, it’s not for society as a whole, but for the individuals using it, as it’s just a means to ensure virtue signaling that increases your popularity, often in the number of imaginary points on your preferred social media. Maybe we should stop arguing the validity of opinions on their popularity and come back to judge them in the strength of the arguments."
Documentaries,fetqm29,t1_fetljhw,1579378452.0,"Yeah of course, because heterosexual men having sex with men is the same than heterosexual women having sex with men. Why not compare it to men having sex with women they don’t feel particularly attracted to? Of course the money in it is nowhere as much, but that would be the only sensible/fair comparison."
WhitePeopleTwitter,feap1mg,t1_fe9jrku,1578950956.0,"He cares a lot about his status as non caring but that doesn’t mean he does care about other people trying to bring post censorship on him. And even if he would care it is the right strategy for a comedian anyway, that way he makes sure anybody knows he is going to keep as usual, he isn’t going to be pressured to self censorship himself. If he wouldn’t announce his noncaring attitude he would be in trouble because people would think he is admitting wrongdoing in his jokes. Either way is a battle that against people that are against freedom of expression (and pretend they support it but with consequences, that’s it, with consequences for people that don’t say what they want) you are guilty if you defend yourself and you are guilty if you don’t, so for some people they are going to find a way to hate no matter what."
Eyebleach,fe2k5a5,t1_fe2eui8,1578839362.0,"You are right, agriculture made specialization of labor possible. Hunter-gatherers didn’t have philosophers, astronomers, architects, etc... This became possible with agriculture because it leaves a lot of free time for the population in general, as many less people are spending time every day looking for food, and because you can store said food for longer periods of time. There are only some times during the year were agriculture is very labor intensive, as it was very different than nowadays when the production is orders of magnitude higher but requires a more intensive supervision."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fdz2ezf,t1_fdvvrk3,1578785968.0,"How you know?, I don’t want to be mean or anything but, this narrative of “you can do anything, you can be successful at anything just if you don’t give up in your dream”, it’s bs. She isn’t talented at drawing, pretending she is going to be an “incredible artist” just based on encouragement and motivation is, imo, laughable absurd. By that token everybody could be a soccer star, football star, Hollywood Star, musical star, NBA Star, bestseller writer, famous comedian, etc... No, that’s not true, very few people can be “incredible artists”, there are millions of kids her age with orders of magnitude more talent for drawing, like you see kids with amazing talent and they most often don’t make it, lying to kids that way doesn’t make them any favor. The opposite would be also bad, telling them they can’t make it, but telling them they can become extraordinarily good at anything they want is also a lie that will hurt them in the future in the form of bad career choices.

We say those things to kids for our own comfort, it’s easy, it is an easy lie that avoids a real conversation. It’s not for their benefit, you could protect their feelings by saying that you love it because she made it for you, you could say so many things, but pretending something is good for her age when is not is a bad thing for the kid, she only needs you to not mess with her enjoying doing it, she doesn’t need you putting absurd expectations on her. Later on she will learn not to ask for honest feedback at home, because she is going to get honest feedback from her peers at some point anyway, and she would learn the real conversations are taken place away from family, were people will tell her the truth."
