Two: 

I grew up with Godzilla movies and other such giant monster movies. I knew they were fake of course - giant kaijus like that don't actually exist. So clearly they made the movies by building giant life-sized kaiju robots, let loose on a giant life-sized and empty replica of the city built for the film, and actually demolished in real life."

It's got a lot of exploration across many different underwater biomes populated by a staggering variety of creatures and enemies. It's both very zen and feel-good at parts, quite intense in others.

I mean according to the other guy posting here, the OP has a good chance of having the charges dropped if they challenge them, because in their state and others there is precedent that ""it smells like weed"" is insufficient to claim probable cause. But because people in r/legaladvice are telling him that it's a done deal, multiple times, highly upvoted with no challenge, he's probably not going to do that. The sub is having too much fun piling on top of this guy to be helpful, and is dispensing what is apparently bad advice.

Even as an occasional lurker I've seen this sort of thing pointed out often enough that it's pretty clear that the sub is not dependable.

I think the headline is accurate enough. He is saying that there isn't evidence that there was a planned attack on four embassies. 

Despite how he says that ""there probably could be additional attacks"" on US embassies, he is admitting that he doesn't know that for a fact, especially with regards to the claim that four were being targeted. 

Also consider for a moment his choice of words: ""additional attacks"". This is probably ""additional"" in regards to the ""attack"" on the US embassy in Iraq on New Years Eve, right? Which was not so much an attack but a riot. There were no bombs or gunfights, and while there was property damage, no one was killed on either side. It ended as a sit-in protest FFS. It was not a murderous terrorist attack of the sort that is implied by the supposed need to assassinate its alleged instigator.

So what he's saying can amount to no more than ""I guess there could be more protests at US embassies"", which is true at any given point in the Middle East anyway, and doesn't do anything to back up the administration's claim that it was necessary to assassinate."
