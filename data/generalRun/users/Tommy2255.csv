That obviously doesn't mean that people who use the word marijuana today are racist. And choosing to look at it that way is comical because it actually is the Spanish word for cannabis, so they're basically saying that it's racist to speak Spanish. While this particular word was used by racists at one point in history, actual Spanish speakers have also been known to speak Spanish on occasion. If you try shaming people for using the term ""marijuana"", you're going to end up targeting relatively few actual racists, and a whole lot of immigrants using a loanword from their first language.

So do Jews. As I understand it (and I'm not a Jew or a theologian, I just skimmed a Wikipedia page once) the idea is that God is infallible therefore he says exactly what he means therefore any interpretation of the word of God that follows it to the letter *must* be a valid interpretation. You can't trick God, therefore any trick that works is not a trick and is in fact an intentional function of God's law. And they believed this so hard that interpretation of the law became a culturally significant act, leading to one of the most robust early legal systems including an adversarial system of legal defense which we still use to this day.

In fact, the word Satan derives from the Hebrew word for ""adversary"" in a legal sense. As in, God created Satan intentionally as an advocate for sin, just as worldly Justice requires an advocate for the accused even if everyone knows they're guilty.

feedthebeast,fg46z60,t1_fg3pwrx,1580497456.0,"Sure, I don't have any current playthroughs with this kind of building, but I can whip up a crude example in creative.

[This](https://imgur.com/a/MNCKvUg) is an example of what I mean by offset stacks. There is a single skylight leading through the roof and floor of each unit, so every room gets the full benefit of natural light, and each unit can expand out to use the roof of the unit below as a balcony, with the offset direction alternating on each level so that nobody has their upstairs neighbor's balcony directly over top of their own balcony. Only one balcony is expanded out and decorated as an example.

This is more decorative than my usual style. This is the sort of thing I might build as an apartment complex for villagers so that they can be safe and happy without taking up much space in terms of the building's footprint. Although if I were going to do that, I'd probably integrate the building's design to tessellate nicely so that I could have a whole row of apartment complexes.

[This](https://imgur.com/a/KfqoQWl) is an example of the sort of spiraling tower design that I tend to favor for my own base. Each room would be dedicated to a specific task. For example I might have a room dedicated to Tinkers with a set of the necessary crafting stations and a smeltery, then I might have another room dedicated to Blood Magic with an altar built out on an adjacent platform. Adequate lighting is ensured with Glowing Glass, my personal favorite lighting option when I can afford it, because it allows natural light while still preventing spawns at night. 

In the center is a small collection of apiaries of the sort I might use for pre-automation manual breeding, I like to give bees a sort of pride of place because they're one of the few things that absolutely requires direct sunlight and can't make do with glowstone. A couple layers up, I have some patio furniture set out on a glass floor, to demonstrate how I might make efficient use of the space without blocking the sunlight to the bees (any non-opaque blocks can be freely used in this part of the base).

The farm plot shows an example of how I might use a certain room. Because each unit has access to the outside of the spiral, there's effectively unlimited space to expand depending on the needs of the mod I plan to work on in that space. I could have a whole field of various different crops expanded out from the unit I dedicated to Agricraft, and all I would have to do is keep expanding out that platform. And even if I continued building upwards all the way around the spiral, by the time I was directly above my earlier constructions, there would be plenty of space in between for it to not feel crowded.

Obviously this is just an example, and if it were for a real playthrough I'd pay a bit more attention to detail. More creative block choice, more consistency in how far offset each unit is in the spiral, more planning to make everything come out even, etc. But that's a general idea of the sorts of things I like to build."

Violent revenge is locally irrational, but making a truly credible threat of violence has social utility. Globally optimal strategies may contain locally suboptimal moves. 

Fighting is dangerous. You could be injured or killed. But making threats is useful, it can earn you safety and resources. In order to make threats effectively, everyone has to know that you're willing to fight. Bluffing won't work, eventually someone will call you out and everyone will know you to be a coward, and threats will never work again. It is only by being 100% genuinely willing to fight and constantly asserting this willingness that you can minimize your risk of exposure to violence.

Anyway, the thing of it is that wizards aren't entirely wrong to think of muggles as lesser. As much as the context of the story makes discrimination in the wizarding world seem to reflect racism, it's really more like ableism. There's an element of completely objective superiority. A man who can use magic is simply better in almost every respect than a man who can't, just like a man with two arms is better than a man with none. There's no fairness or equality to it, being able to do magic is simply better than not being able to. Muggles aren't even inherently smarter, just better educated due to a different society. You can't even honestly say that muggles achieved more because their limitations forced them to be creative rather than rely on magic for everything. The differences are far better explained as a matter of sheer numbers more than anything. More people around having ideas, more free exchange of ideas between people, more opportunities for innovation, more opportunities for revolutionary ways of thinking, and eventually The Enlightenment happens.

Not being racist is at least possible. Ableism is much harder to combat, because it's natural to judge people by their ability. You would only come to the conclusion that one skin color is better than another by being taught. Nobody has to teach you that it's better to be smarter or stronger or capable of teleportation. 

That's probably why canon spends so much more time dealing with muggleborn than it does dealing with discrimination against muggles themselves. It's a much easier issue to deal with, because you can settle it with a simple objective observation. Blood purists say that blood purity affects magical ability. Halfbloods and muggleborn can be observed casting spells just as easily as purebloods. Therefore, blood purists are wrong. In order to argue against wizard-supremacists, it isn't a matter of facts, it's a matter of value judgements. Wizard supremacists say that muggles are inferior because they can't use magic. How do you prove that an ability to use magic isn't relevant to a person's moral value? How do you prove that human life has moral value in the first place? You have to establish some objective standard first. If trying to objectively prove a basis of morality is even possible, it's far beyond the scope of what the canon story was meant to be."

But consider if it were instead a Vaporeon with a base recruitment rate of -12%. Under the same conditions, you'd have an 18.1% of recruitment. Without the Golden Mask, that would be a -2% chance, in other words impossible for a party leader at that level."

TwoBestFriendsPlay,ffmcn3s,t1_ffkm7lq,1580052427.0,"Jedi deflect blasterfire primarily through minor precognition rather than reflexes alone. Putting up a block where you know an attack will be is much easier than catching the projectile in mid-air. There probably are Jedi who could manage that, but far fewer than the number who can deflect blasters effectively.

As for returning them to the shooter with the force, if they could do that, they'd just carry around a bag of ball bearings. Lasers can be reflected. A physical projectile would have to be stopped then accelerated again in the other direction. Or you'd have to somehow curve the bullet 180 degrees without slowing it, which would be a whole other level of difficult way beyond simply catching bullets, and if you're at that point you might as well just force pinch a nerve cluster or something because you're Jedi God."

Is that from a nearby anthill? If so, that's the best way to deal with zombies all around town. Kite enemies into each other. Ants are tolerable to deal with in small numbers, and more crucially don't evolve as far as I'm aware, so you can lead ants into zombies or zombies into ants until you're just left with a few ants, then kill those and smash the zombies. You can clear out a city block by block that way, and you'll be safe unless hordes show up.
