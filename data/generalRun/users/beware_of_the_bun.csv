Friend, I had a change of mind on this a few weeks ago. A month ago I would have said I agree completely with your opinion. That was until I had excruciating pain in my abdomen. I went to the ER and had to get an emergency appendectomy. At that point cost didn't matter; if my appendix were to burst my life would be in danger, so I had to have treatment. Recovering in the hospital for three days gave me lots of uninterrupted time to think and reflect. If I didn't have my health insurance what were the doctors to do? Send me away knowing my life was in danger? My pain was extraordinary, the worst I've ever felt. I don't wish that pain on anyone.
