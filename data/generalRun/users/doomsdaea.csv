bisexual,ffmqsbq,t1_ffmov5z,1580057936.0,"Oh, of course. Although I haven't been in your exact situation, I understand the aftermath of that kind of assault all too well, and it's so important to me that other survivors know that there are others to lean on. 

It's hard to put this into words, and a preemptive TW for this paragraph, but sexual trauma can sort of lead into the unconcious acceptance that, ""this is just how it's supposed to be"". The reality is just so horrible to deal with that the subconcious tries to find ways to make it normal. I know very, very many people who have similar feelings about other traits their abusers had, rather than just gender. Things like height, weight, age, haircolor, smell. It's so sinister, because like, obviously these feelings by themselves can be horribly triggering, but it seems to be a pretty common part of surviving this kind of trauma. I haven't heard of people discussing the gender factor outside of LGBT circles, now that I think about it."
bisexual,ffmlw7b,t1_ffmf9nd,1580056449.0,"I've got to say, it is *very strange* of your therapist to suggest that you're straight, and that you just thought you were a lesbian until you were assaulted. I have only ever heard that line of reasoning coming from homophobes who were justifying ""corrective"" assault, but of course, you're the *only* person who gets to determine your sexuality. Not me, not your therapist, not anybody else.

Again, I'm not trying to dictate your sexuality, but I feel that I should mention that it's not uncommon for women, even questioning lesbians, to equate that specific discomfort you mentioned (the ""weird"" feeling?) to attraction. Especially in instances of assault. One of my best friends experiences this on an ongoing basis as a result of her trauma, but she doesn't consider her feelings towards men to be a genuine part of her sexuality because she finds them to be pretty intensely distressing, whereas she feels calm and comforted by her attraction to women. 

Trauma changes us, there's no question about it. But when it comes to what you, specifically, are going through, you are not alone. Not one bit."

ftm,ffmfosk,t1_ffmfepy,1580054010.0,"OP is a truscum and likely does not care about what the medical/research organizations who treat us have to say about gender incongruence/that not all trans people qualify for a GD diagnosis, not that what you're saying isn't sound, just that that's what the truscum subreddit is for.

Gotta love it when people beg for information about dysphoria while ignoring that the diagnostic criteria flat out states that it doesn't apply to everybody."
bisexual,ffme3iu,t3_eu7zih,1580053191.0,"Attraction is supposed to feel *good*. Assault like that can stir up a lot of confusing feelings, and they're not always genuine or permanent. Do your feelings towards men feel good, or do they feel distressing?"

insaneparents,ffi2yy6,t1_ffi2oe2,1579963562.0,"Oh, I absolutely agree with you, and I didn't mean to imply that I don't!

insaneparents,ffi2dlt,t1_ffi274a,1579963055.0,"And likewise. I'm so sorry that you have such similar experiences to me, and to a ton of others in this group. It makes me nauseous to think about just how many phrases and actions our abusers almost all seem to share in common, but at least there are plenty of kind people like yourself here to commisserate with!"
insaneparents,ffi28wx,t1_ffi1x6j,1579962940.0,"Yeah, it's just hard to separate them. I'm sure to anybody who has not had more than a surface level relationship with my mother, her claims of parental alienation make perfect sense. 

She's able to behave herself around folks who aren't her family, so when she came out with the alienation allegations, people who hadn't witnessed the abuse flocked to believe her. Unfortunately, this is the most potent child abuse defense out there, because if the only two people who were around for the abuse are the abuser and the child, the abuser can just claim that the child has fabricated memories of the abuse.

It's an impossible judgement to make for somebody who isn't in the specific situation at hand, and of course each case is unique, but it's just so hard to differentiate for people who haven't had negative experiences with the abuser."

insaneparents,ffi0v7k,t1_ffi0igw,1579961676.0,"I've ALWAYS felt like my mom telling everybody I was brainwashed into believing she had abused me was her externalizing the gaslighting, getting everybody else to do her dirty work for her. I guess I wasn't so far off if they're forming internet roving alienation assimilation gangs."
insaneparents,ffi0s0x,t1_ffi0ljm,1579961592.0,"Oh my god. I'm so sorry. My mom just posts about it on her waify blog, but it still fucking stings to see people buying into her bullshit. It doesn't matter if we have witnesses, it doesn't matter if we have evidence, the second they say ""parental alienation"", *they're* the victim."
insaneparents,ffi0bpf,t1_ffhy8m7,1579961157.0,"I read further down in the comments and it turns out there are entire groups of adults with ""estranged"" kids who go and harass child abuse victims on reddit to try and get them to interact with their abusers. Would not be surprised if this freak was one."

insaneparents,ffhw14a,t1_ffhv9g7,1579956471.0,"Yes, the name of the group is likely the main problem in this post, but no, the issue isn't that most of us here don't know what that means. The issue lies in how abusers can use that terminology to declare themselves to be the victim, like the OP of this facebook post. 

Many of us who were genuinely abused witnessed our abusers use ""parental alienation"" as a cop out to explain why the kids who were being abused refused to spend time with the abusers, and so adding that into the context of this group's name starts to smell really fishy... It's not that Parental Alienation doesn't exist and isn't awful, it's the context of it's invocation in this screenshot."
insaneparents,ffhvwpl,t3_etq18v,1579956318.0,"How many of us have abusive parents who tried to pull the alienation card? Jesus, it's the perfect excuse to abuse a kid while also discrediting anything they say for the rest of their lives."

The first is that you could introduce yourself to strangers that way through omegle or another anonymous chat site. If you go this route remember to put some LGBT-related tags in your ""interests"" section, just so you don't get connected with any bigots. LGBT discord servers are wonderful places to go for this, even if you decide to join one full of strangers.

Another idea is the Pronoun Dressing Room,  which is basically a minigame you can find online where you put in a name and pronouns, and it'll give you a list of literary classics where you're the leading character. Another similar idea is that you could try and write some short stories or sentences about yourself using the pronouns you're checking out."

So, to use way more commonplace dictionary sources just because I feel like this is a really commonplace definition of the -phobia suffix, MW and Dictionary.com make the hate/intolerance/prejuidice meanings of the suffix explicit, but an implicit way to gleam the meaning in a sociological context (again, the words of some almost annoyingly pretentious professor) is to view the definitions of each of the bigoted examples presented above, and even the fact that OP put words that use the -phobia suffix right next to the word ""racist"", which explicitly means race-based bigotry. 

Pretty much any other example of a word that's commonly associated with social bigotry that has the suffix -phobia is defined the same way, because that is now an accepted definition of that suffix.

So for example, the MW definition@ of homophobia and islamophobia cover not only the psychological -phobia context (irrational fear), but it also describes intense aversion and discrimination. Dictionary.com specifically describes prejuidice, and in the case of islamophobia, specifically mentions that this is often a ""political force""."

My mother would constantly say horrible things and then completely deny that they'd ever been said. She'd tell me that my demonstrably real illnesses were ""all in my head"" (a very common gaslighting phrase, not that it's *always* used in gaslighting) and use that as an excuse to medically neglect me. This led to very serious injuries being ignored for several days at a time. 

One time, after her husband left a bruise on my arm, I called my dad to pick me up, and that turned into me ""always running away from my problems"". My actions of self-defense were always completely decontextualized and I was told over and over again that I was guilty of things that I had no memory of doing, and that I could not have possibly done regardless.

I noticed that my personal journal (tends to be a mistake in an abusive household, I know, but I was little) had been clearly gone through, complete with her freaking nailpolish streaked on some of the pages, and that turned into ""me *always* accusing her of reading my journals when she *never* once did"", even when she accidentally showed me a picture she took of a separate poem that I had hidden in my school binder about a year down the line..."

One good counter argument in that instance could be that GI is also a recognized medical condition, and international health organizations have declared that nondysphoric individuals with GI should be allowed to transition and have their genders respected as well.

Some medical supply stores have a big selection that you can try out in person-- I find that cane handles with lots of padding work well for me, but the recommended handle for people with hand issues (can't remember what it's called, apologies) caused me more grief than the ""standard"" handle.

Another tip is please, please pick up a cane with a pattern you actually like. Hell, you can get multiple canes to go with different outfits. It can be a drag being a young cane user, so we deserve to at least have nice looking ones. 

The mental aspect of going out into public with mobility aids can be difficult, especially at first, so *please* don't hesitate to reach out to folks. Here or otherwise."
lgbt,fejm7tb,t1_fejm09i,1579179618.0,"Oh! My bad, I didn't mean that either-- I mean that plenty of times folks genuinely think it's ""just"" a recolored flag (idk if you know, but flag recolors are a big thing on tumblr) and they tend to reach out and ask about either the flag recolor, or why a gay man is using what they percieve to be a lesbian flag."
lgbt,fejlvfh,t1_fejll0w,1579179293.0,"I wasn't being sassy, it was a genuine suggestion. A friend of mine made the original post with the blue flag and he regrets the fact that it doesnt have any meaning, and people who use it often have to clarify that they are not lesbians. I'm not so good at communicating tone over the internet, but since I came off as an ass, I just want to clarify that wasn't my intention."

If you're the kind of person who's MEGA into those tumblr flags, sure, do what you want, but when lesbians start messaging you like ""oh, nice blue lesbian flag"" you might want to have a copy-paste response."

I didn't even realize until just now that my comment could have been read as harsh, I didn't intend for that! It just kind of irks me sometimes that a lot of these current definitions just completely ignore bi history, and I wasn't careful enough with my tone.

I don't know too much about the ace/aspec (thats the term, right?) part of the community, but given that a lot of the identity terms y'all have coined focus on how somebody experiences attraction rather than strictly what gender somebody is, I understand how it could potentially be pretty hard to find the exact label that suits your needs."

lgbt,febwm61,t1_febuihb,1578963550.0,"Hey, sorry to correct you, but this isn't the case! Bisexuals can most definitely be attracted to trans people, and it's a transphobic idea that you can tell whether or not any one person is trans enough to be categorically not attracted to trans people. I'm not saying you're a transphobe, just talking about that implication!"
lgbt,febw49n,t3_eoddwb,1578963448.0,"The pansexual label came to exist because a group of people misunderstood what bisexual was and decided they needed a separate word to fit their experiences. Note that this does *not* mean that there is a material difference between bisexual and pansexual.

Bisexuals have been begging for at least 30 years for people to recognize that 1. We're inclusive of & attracted to trans people 2. We're inclusive of & attracted to nonbinary people, and 3. Bisexuality does *not* mean that you do or do not have a preference between genders.

Ever since people began using the word pansexual in this way in like 2009, bisexuals have had to explain that no, plenty bisexuals feel the same way and they're still bisexual, and people have been bending over backwards to try to fabricate a difference between the terms for years. It's just a linguistic redundancy :P"
