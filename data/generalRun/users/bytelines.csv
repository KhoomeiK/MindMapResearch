todayilearned,ff4vca7,t1_ff4cpb1,1579573321.0,"""Socialist"" and ""national socialist"" are very two different terms. Nazis are literally national socialists (where the ""na"" and ""zi"" come from).

The nazis imprisoned and murdered the socialists. Theres a monument at the Reichstag for all the socialist politicians they killed.

It's far from pedantic."

worldnews,fe4fpb4,t1_fe4dem7,1578858751.0,"""Assassination"" is a quote. It's the State Departments word.

Killed by unknown gunmen in a car. What word would you suggest?"
worldnews,fe3bi5c,t1_fe36ex3,1578847769.0,Is the video of them doing this also bullshit?

worldnews,fdak79z,t3_ekdanz,1578246921.0,I'm unclear did they actually sign something into law? Did they simply vote? What was the outcome  of the vote? Is it symbolic or binding?

politics,fchyrvi,t1_fchfi8w,1577655705.0,"Are you denying that opposition to ACA is a right wing view? Are you arguing that supreme court ruling in any way changed this? Are you arguing the individual mandate isn't the most staunchly opposed aspect of the aca?

Yes ACA was a center conservative type of reform. It's completely and utterly opposed, today, by the right wing. Roberts was instrumental in keeping it. Yet he's still a right wing lackey?"

Therefore ""its easier for a camel to pass through this city gate than a rich man to enter heaven"" which makes literally no sense at all but conveniently doesnt exclude a rich man from entering heaven. Checkmate atheists!"
