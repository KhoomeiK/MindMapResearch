Applicants definitely take note of this; I know for me you all have definitely gone up in my personal rankings. 

Thank you for providing recourses like this for free, and from the school itself!"
LSAT,ffe2ng2,t3_eszqzb,1579835105.0,"The best part of studying full time is that you don’t actually have to study full time. Dedicate a part of the day (I would pick 8am-12pm personally) and work super hard during that time. Drill, PT, foolproof, whatever. 

And then. For the rest of the day. Do your thing. Do that thing you’ve been wanting to do but haven’t been able. You won’t have time to do it in law school! It may be walking the dog more. Taking a bar tending class. Reading 100 books this year. Going to the gym. Whatever. 

Working 8+hrs every day on the LSAT is a sure fire way to burn out. Don’t think of this time as simply an investment in the LSAT, but in yourself as well."

personalfinance,ff98nr7,t1_ff977cb,1579707394.0,"If OP can get a decent house in a decent neighborhood for 120k *and* makes $23/hr, they are not lower class. That means that the COL is low and OP makes 3x minimum wage. 

If he were living in SF and making $23/hr? Probably lower class. If he were making 8.50/hr in his LCOL area? Probably lower class. 

OP can get to his $10,000 by simply continuing to save $1,000/month for ten months."
