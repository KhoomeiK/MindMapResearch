Hair,ffhggqa,t3_etlreq,1579934191.0,Bruh....that before. I’m so sorry you got that after thinking you were going to a professional. My DIY-“I did it myself in the bathroom mirror with shit from sally beauty” balayage still looks miles better than that lol. Your hair is looking fabulous now though so I’m so glad it all got sorted out!
bon_appetit,ffhg4ar,t1_ffhfv1n,1579933786.0,"The mashed potatoes are seriously a game changer! I couldn’t get over how delicious they were. I mean, that much butter and cream will do that...but still. The apple walnut cake sounds amazing and I bet you felt like a pro after flipping it! Enjoy your new kitchen!"
bon_appetit,ffhefri,t1_ffh9een,1579931874.0,"I would love to see a Rick show! He has such a warm personality and ties a lot of his food into personal anecdotes about his life, culture, and family which I think is really cool. Plus he is very clear and precise in the way he describes recipes. He’s a joy to watch. Give us a Rick show, BA!"
ChoosingBeggars,ffhe0jo,t1_ffh3dyk,1579931421.0,"Right?! Literally everything in this pack is useful, i can’t understand what she was expecting from a free box that would be better than this? Does her baby not need it’s ass wiped?"
bon_appetit,ffhd92p,t3_etlhju,1579930611.0,"Your recipes all look so good, nice photography too! 

I made a lot of BA recipes this thanksgiving (but not the making perfect ones) - Chris’ Very Classic Dry Brjned Roast Turkey, the Simple is Best stuffing (amazing), and Andy’s Ultra Creamy Mashed Potatoes. 

They all came out incredible but omg...the mashed potatoes are otherworldly. Simple, super rich, but holy crap so good. The stuffing won the battle of the stuffing at my family’s thanksgiving too! It’s like a chef-y version of the boxed kind, super classic flavors but delicious. 

I made Chris’ pistachio kale pesto which was also delicious. I didn’t have it over pasta, I just used it as a sauce for all kinds of things and I loved it. 

I’ve also made Molly’s Burnt Basque Cheesecake. I totally messed up the proportions of the recipe (it’s in my post history) and it was still really delicious so I’d like to make it another time correctly. 

Next I think I might like to try some of Rick’s recipes, especially his chile Colorado, and maybe some of Claire’s breads/desserts. I also think it would be fun to try some of the more doable gourmet makes recipes like the pop tarts or hot pockets."
fatlogic,ffh8kj4,t1_ffgnkpo,1579926203.0,Tbh she might. A lot of people with food issues wake up in the middle of the night and go raid the pantry. It’s hilarious that your coworker thinks that though lol. I fasted for 22 hours today so I guess I’m deceased??
Hair,ffgkme5,t3_ethyuu,1579908406.0,I really like the messy chic look! I actually think it would look even better cut bluntly to right above where the text is on your shirt. Would look really good with the bangs and layers you’ve got going on. Ps your glasses are super cute!
