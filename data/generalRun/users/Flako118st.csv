insanepeoplefacebook,ffld6o7,t3_etukp6,1580038037.0,"I cut my hand 2 years ago. I literally bled all the way home while taking a bus. Cops saw me and called a ambulance. I was drunk but I knew I had cut my self. I told the ambulance I declined a ride,as it M would cost me over 500 for a ride. Got some hydrogen peroxide. Clean my self, they gave me some gauze.  They even made me sign some paper saying I decline. Next day I woke up n saw how real deep I cut my hand. I took the train to the hospital 10 stitches.  Still 250 for stitches. When the doctor saw my hand and my sneakers. He said why didn't you come yesterday , I honestly told him I was drunk, but not drunk enough to pay 500 for a ambulance ride. His face said everything. A week later I went to a local clinic they asked me what happened. They understood(I had no insurance). My stitches were taken off , my hand was looked at( my bill zero) it was never process. Because taken stitches off alone would've been almost 100 dollars.

Just like petty offenders (felons)who end up in prison for petty offenses.  If I'm not wrong is about 160k a year for a person. But if you have them housing. It would cost less than half of that money. (Including non violent offenders ). Why did I say this? 
Let's say you have a homeless person. Let's say some one calls a ambulance or police, then think about the processing fee...followed by the people who do the follow up....followed by the third party help...followed by the same thing happening in less than month.

However many keyboard warriors chimed in. I don't care about your opinion honestly. I care about ops opinion. Because resentment is a feeling I had for so long. Until I let go n try to move forward by breaking the cycle. Not necessarily with my father , but with family members. But it lifted a weight off my shoulders. As I spoken to many people who did the same. Family is #1. I have asked for not toxicity but breaking the cycle how ever. Based on post. All I see is anger,hatred, even those who claim to do some reading before you speak comments. Have yet to mention what I said. Parents sometimes bring what they learned as kids as the norms. Suffering. I want n ask to break the cycle. Be the better man. But all the answers are just bitter , mad full of hate towards parents which makes me wonder. Why do ya hate parents so much?

Trust me, I seen it around way more often than people think based on online commenting. As I stated trauma often translate to the same from father to son. But one has to break the cycle. And resentment often times brings back that cycle."

Emotional trauma has long effects. Physical and emotional trauma must be such a burden. He is still your dad man. Regardless of anything . All we can do is love them , and try to help them.

Look both ways as you leave your building. If you have any sort of mirrors that can help you look outside, wall side mirrors to look outside. You'll be surprise to see how much suspicious things happen specially in the morning, not so much at night.  As you walk towards your destination if it's at night time. Look at your shadow, it helps you to know if some one is approaching you. Do not panick people walk the same routes as you. But if your gut tells you be careful, look towards any mirrow (car,shop) that reflects. That will tell you alot. If you look back most likely if some one wants to harm you, will either trigger them to stop or to move in. If you feel terribly suspicious. Find the nearest shop go in and buy w.e kill time. If the person goes inside try to make small talk with the shop keeper. This will make them hesitate and leave. Do not for the love of God run towards your building ,house. This will let them know where to find you again. 
And my security tip. Carry pens with those skinny tips.  Incase of need use it. Keep it in your pocket place it in your hand ready to use. (Women take it out and scream) as you threaten to stab them with it.  Or two carry a bottle made of glass(soda)  throw towards the person. As a distraction and run.
