AskReddit,ffa6gnl,t3_esd42q,1579728810.0,"1. Love unconditionally ( thanks mom and dad)

2. Forgive ( proven to reduce stress / cause stress
    otherwise)

3. Be patient with many aspects in life (Not just with
    family and friends)

           1. The stranger driving slow when all you
               want is to get home after a long day. They
               may be old, they may have lost someone,
               they may be depressed, they may be
               hurting, they may have work problems,
               home problems. So many hypotheticals. 
               YOU CAN BE PATIENT. YOU CAN GO
               AROUND, IF POSSIBLE. You will get where
               you're going eventually. YES, THERE ARE
               PLAIN JERKS OUT THERE. Mostly consider
               that it isn't intentional. It's not going to
               help to tailgate and push. Ultimately 
               leading to the victim being one or both if 
               taken too far. My husband laughs and
               shakes his head but I windshield wiper fluid
               people tailgating me. If I can't go any faster
               bc of the car in front of me, and you're.  
               tailgating me..... and I have to brake hard
               then there will be a bad day for you also. 

           2. Your pet that peed or pooped inside, that
               bark too much, that simply are irritating
               you. They love you unconditionally as you
               should give back the same. Animals
               repeatedly prove their companionship and
               loyalty over and over for centuries. Not
               limited to dogs, cats, rats, cows,horses and
               more....

            3. Your elderly or not elderly family that have
                onset dementia or full blown alzheimers.
                They know not what they are saying or
                doing let alone forgetting. Be kind, play
                along with repeating yourself, don't
                degrade and belittle them. Love. Be gentle. 
                Respect. 

            4. Try not to go to bed angry with your SO.
                 Trying is better then not trying. 

            5. Say I love you to those you love often
                because life can be taken in a moment.

            6. Break rules sometimes. Follow your gut.
                Just don't break these rules. Lol.

Life,feknu16,t3_epmbyp,1579203927.0,"Forgiveness? The other answers are good also. I like the awareness one.

You find it within yourself to understand why you hate them. 

My son whose 17 works with a manager way older that is rude, bossy and my son highly dislikes him. I told him he should try to kill him with kindness. Do you know why the manager is the way he is towards you son? Because you are 17, going to be in a great college, with a great future and career and he is old and at BK. LIFE dealt him shit cards maybe.... so son, be kind, do as asked and don't hate. Hate causes us wat more stress then we all need in our lives. We have enough.

I don't know if this is relevant but I haven't hated anybody per se. At times I thought I hated my ex husband for his actions but in time I came to understand that within myself, I didn't ""hate"" him per se. I was disappointed in his decisions and feel as if I hate him for not being mature enough,selfless even not being part of his sons life, to provide help on his own without being made to... never sending bd cards or Christmas cards for example. My mom and dad said they had to forgive him to move forward. I almost think hate is more of a feeling for me at times.
