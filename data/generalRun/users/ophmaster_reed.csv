facepalm,fed4967,t1_fed3lvm,1578998070.0,"And it was taken down there in less than a month for that exact reason. I'm arguing that the law (at least in the US) doesn't actually convict people of this on a statistically significant basis. Even plainly criminal rapes are hard to convict, much less ones with as much ambiguity as that. Sure a woman can bring charges, but the likelihood of it even getting to court, and the even less likely event of a conviction, and even *less* likely chance of the rapist seeing even a single day behind bars is tiny. 
I personally saw a case in which my husband's father raped his cousin when she was 13. She pressed charges, it ripped his family in two camps, one defending him and calling her a liar and the other side defending the girl. He went to court... and got six months of probation. Oh, and he had to take some court ordered classes. It's not like they didnt have evidence either... they had witnesses, medical reports, text messages dating 2 years prior of this stuff (since she was 11). Did I mention that shes developmentally delayed as well? A 45 year old man can rape a family member who is 11 for 2 years and get 6 months PROBATION. Needless to say we have cut him off from our 3 young daughters. 
Anyway my point is rape is rarely punished as it should be even in clear cases.
Edit: one more thing, the most infuriating part is that he didn't even have to register as a sex offender. We went to an arcade/roller rink in town for one of our girls' birthday and GUESS WHO WAS THERE. AROUND CHILDREN. Makes me fucking sick."

facepalm,fed2i5n,t1_fed1x3i,1578995479.0,"I was reading state laws that do say that the person need to be passed out drunk for them to be incapable of consent. Conscious but ""severely"" impaired is more of a gray area and looked at on a case by case basis. To complicate matters more, the laws vary state to state. 
My question is what's the alternative? Make drinking automatic, irreversible consent to sex with any person? ""Yeah, she was so drunk she didnt know where she was or how she got there or who I was  and was fading in and out of conciousness while I fucked her but dont worry, I made sure to shotgun a couple bud lights first so it's not rape because, you know, I was drunk too. So were all my friends that had sex with her after. Oh, she regretted the ""sex"" afterwards? I guess she should have thought of that before I drank those bud lights."" 

I understand it can be hard to determine if reasonable signals of consent were given in a courtroom after the fact, but we can't just let alcohol be a free pass to rape either."
facepalm,fed1vo7,t1_fed1qzc,1578994535.0,Well if this is so common there must be a plethora of these kind if cases. Where are they? People get drunk and have sex ALL THE TIME. Where are all the convictions of men by women who had one too many cosmos and regretted the sex after?
facepalm,fed1mku,t1_fed18w0,1578994160.0,"The poster makes a sexist assumption, sure. Admittedly law really isnt my specialty, I'm in nursing. However from what I've read it could (but no necessarily) be considered rape in the case that the woman was so drunk that she could not participate in sex, give consent, or resist attack while the actor (rapist) would necessarily be less drunk than that in order to carry out a rape. Basically the victim (male or female) has to be so drunk they are not conscious, and the rapist could not possibly be as drunk as the victim, or else they would be unconscious as well, so two tipsy people having sex are not raping each other.  I agree that men are less likely to be taken seriously when making a complaint about sexual assault, especially when the perpetrator was a female. Its shitty, but slowly starting to change."
facepalm,fed152v,t1_fed0nmt,1578993450.0,"Because getting drunk and committing a crime is still a crime. Sex is not a crime. I agree that if both parties are approximately equally intoxicated that a rape allegation out of regret is morally reprehensible. Also the poster is flat wrong, either party can be held legally responsible for a crime if consent was not able to be given. Obviously (and I really hope I dont need to explain this) that this happens much, MUCH more frequently to women by men. The second most common is to men by men. The least common is by women to men. Both men and women are unlikely to report rape, while false rape accusations are rare, accounting for 2-8% of all allegations. It's far more common for a woman to be raped and not report it than for a man to be falsely accused of rape, and studies have shown the majority of ""false accusations"" were simply cases of misidentification, the rape happened but accused the wrong person."
