presacanario,ffd7p1g,t1_ffd6skw,1579815029.0,Thank you! I was going to ask where you got it from. I showed my husband last night and wants to get one for our girl who looks like your guy :)
Pets,ffc3nsn,t3_esnxa0,1579790743.0,"First off, I'm so sorry for your sudden loss. 

Something a bit similar happened to me and my husband. We came home from work just like usual and we saw him, Obzen, laying under a blanket by the fire place. I bent down to pet him as I usually did, noticed he was foaming from his mouth, couldn't move his back legs, his eyes were just lifeless but he was still breathing. I wrapped him up in a blanket and as we rushed him to the vet he died in my arms.

 I still think to this day he held on to say good by to us. He was only 3 years old. He was the best boy, He was our first cat together. He was our love, our baby. 

I still call our newest kitten Obzen sometimes, just out of habit. (Its been 2 years since he passed) I loved that name, It was just like him.. Perfect."

PetMice,ffa7fb3,t3_esh9d2,1579729343.0,"I'm not sure what the correct answer is to this.. but I do let my  single male play/ interact with my females on occasion because i feel the male gets lonely. (not sure if he's actually lonely but I think I would be) and I have not had any ""accident"" litters yet. :)"

presacanario,fcsrisv,t1_fcnrczk,1577923279.0,"My vet told me not to take mine to dog parks but i dont have any around here. If you decide to take her,  at least for the first few trips i would keep a leash on her. Just for her safety and others. If you see regular people and dogs showing up. Ask if you can let her play with their pup, and if ok and theres only you 2 let her off and just keep close. I know that sounds hard with a very energetic pup in a large fenced area but if you ever start to feel uncomfortable... get her back on the leash.  There's nothing wrong with you doing that. You are keeping her and others safe. Please ask if you have any other questions.. im still learning too but am very happy to help"
presacanario,fcsqzmk,t1_fcos9g8,1577922898.0,I second this... my girl does not listen to my husband because she knows he will not correct her. But when im around she's very obedient (besides jumping) and always listens to me.
presacanario,fcsqt7r,t1_fcnfi5w,1577922770.0,"She is with certain things, like we are having trouble getting her not to jump up when she's excited. But for the most of everything as long as you start training as a youngster, they are so amazing. If you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask.  She's 10 months old right now.. so I'm still learning too but she has been one of the most amazing breeds i have ever had the chance of loving."
presacanario,fcnfi5w,t3_ei46j7,1577810652.0,"I got my girl at 12 weeks . You should do the training, even better with a trainer. They are a wonderful breed but can be stubborn.

we socialized her very well as a puppy, taking her out for long walks, if someone wanted to pet her we would make her sit before, we took her to dog events where she could be around other dogs (that were on leashes not like a dog park where it's free roam) 

Just make sure you work with her and she will be a great family member :)"
