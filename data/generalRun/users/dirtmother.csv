Oh and if you like reggae dancehall, Tommy Lee Sparta is pretty unique, especially his early black metal- inspired gangster stuff. And of course the original upsetter Lee ""Scratch"" Perry; the whole Jamaican E.T. album will make you feel possessed, in a good way. There was an issue of Hellblazer where John Constantine called L'S'P ""powerful voodoo magic to brainwash white hippies"" or something like that lol. It fits.

Interestingly, there was an experiment done some years ago about what songs make chickens shiver. That one made them shiver the most.

AskReddit,fdmyg6s,t1_fdk5qd1,1578571318.0,"If drugging is allowed as ""no physical pain"", then deleriants are king by a large margin. Intelligence agencies have definitely experimented with scopolamine, but really anything that acts on acetylcholine can be hellish and cause severe hallucinations and detachment from reality that is almost never pleasant. Common themes in deleriant intoxication: talking to people who aren't there, spiders/scorpions crawling out of the walls,  demons/shadow people, time lapse, intense unquenchable thirst paired with a frequent, painful need to urinate while completely unable to. Some common ones: diphenhydramine (Benadryl/otc sleeping pills), dimenhydrinate (gravol/motion sickness pills), datura/Jimson weed, angel trumpets, Belladonna/deadly nightshade, Mandrake root.  Of course you would need to use the whole bottle of diphenhydramine/dimenhydrinate, they don't act as deleriants until 20-100x their therapeutic dose. The plants are much more potent and also much nastier, since they also include a cocktail of other drugs and posions, especially nightshade. Jim Morrison quit doing drugs for two years after experimenting with Datura... Think about that for a minute.
