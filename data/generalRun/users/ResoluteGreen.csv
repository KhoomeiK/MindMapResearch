You do realize you're talking about redoing the entire basis of the government and judicial system right? It's going to take a lot of work. Menu costs alone would probably be astronomical. You know how many thousands of hours of bureaucrats and politicians time it will take? 

You're talking about taking a country that doesn't even have a constitution, is built around the Crown, and turning it into a republic. Who gets to decide? Who gets to decide who gets to decide? What mechanism can we use to make the transition? What's the legal basis? Do we do public consultations? What do those look like? Is there going to be a referendum? That's without even going into details on how the system will function. The change would take an inordinate amount of time and money, and cause massive disruption, even worse than Brexit."
onguardforthee,fee64ta,t1_fee496y,1579027190.0,"Yes but at what cost? If it cost £1 Trillion (14 months of UK budget) then it would take over 2,000 years to make your money back.

Half a billion pounds sounds like a lot of money, but when your annual budget is nearing a trillion pounds a year it really isn't. This is a common problem of not being able to wrap our head around numbers this large.

If you had a household budget of £50,000 a year, this would be equivalent of trying to save £26 per year (about £2 per month). How much would you spend to save that £2 per month? Would you spend £100 for a 4 year return? Would you spend £1000 for a 38 year return? Would you spend £10,000 for a 384 year return?

onguardforthee,fee3h8y,t1_fee2jo9,1579025619.0,"Why should taxpayers pay for removing the monarchy and reconstituting the country as a republic when there's more pressing matters to fix? I imagine if you asked voters if they'd rather spend time on the monarchy or spend time fixing health care (or unemployment, or transportation, or...) they wouldn't chose to waste time and money on removing the monarchy.

You seem to keep skipping over the fact that changing would cost money as well. You won't be changing the system for free, it will take a lot of time and money to remove the monarchy, in direct costs, and then as I mentioned there's the other impacts as well, like to the economy, foreign relations, trade, etc."

How expensive will it be to transition? What economic effect would the transition and uncertainty have on the UK economy? Markets don't like uncertainty, especially on that level, this would be worse than Brexit because the entire UK legal and government structure could be changing. 

Would that outweigh the £345M/yr in savings? In 2018 the UK budget had an expenditure of £842 BILLON. The savings, even if fully realized, and even if the transition cost nothing, would only amount to 0.04% of the annual budget in savings."
