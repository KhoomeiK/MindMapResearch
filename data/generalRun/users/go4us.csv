SuicideWatch,fdfbn9q,t1_fdf94ho,1578357878.0,"Look, im not giving advise from the view of a psychologist or teacher or whatever. If someone comes to me with a problem i will try to help you in a completely different way than a psychologist will. What i try to say is please take in consideration that it can freak people out when officials get involved, especially if you're not sure if they want this or not. As i said people and situations are different and so are the things they need in hard times. I experienced a lot of pain in my life because of depression, self harm and suicide and i wanted to share what i learned from that time. Im sorry that its not the advise a professional would give."
SuicideWatch,fdegpbl,t1_fddxspg,1578338642.0,"Every situation and every person is as different to another as it can get. I understand that. But what i realised is that when someone really, and i mean REALLY, wants to kill himself, they want to kill themselves, and not a visit from a bunch of cops that maybe even put you in a cell. When i was at my lowest point and i had to talk to my friends about whats going on i made them promise to me that they dont call the cops on me no matter what. And i told them if they still do it i will stop thinking about it and just jump from the bridge behind my house. If a person is unsure if life or death is the best option, believe me, havimg the cops in front of your house influences your thinking in a bad way."
SuicideWatch,fddwwk0,t1_fddcuh3,1578325966.0,"This may seem like the perfect answer at first but it isnt, especially letting the police know. If in my situation back then my friends acted like this i would have  definitely gone trough with the plan of killing myself. Just more spontaniously as i had planned."

trashy,f0pkhcn,t1_f0oqigx,1568836567.0,Why do we really always have to generalise... I dont know in which country this was but its absolutely impossible that adults in my country would act this trashy.
