truerateme,fdtrxat,t3_en295t,1578721257.0,6. I would recommend maybe a slightly different hair style and personally I am not a fan of the piercing but some people like that so it’s up to you whether you like it or not.

depression,fdlbk8z,t3_elwq1m,1578520525.0,I think it would be a cool idea if you get have people struggling with mental afflictions to be able to submit designs too or vote on new designs
depression,fddiq92,t3_ekqoek,1578313904.0,Great to hear! I finally reached out for help a few months ago because it was getting to be too much to handle on my own. Yes I was skeptical of medication and therapy but it actually helps. And don’t be discouraged if you still have bad days even with help. We all have highs and lows on our journey. I’m proud of you for taking this step towards getting better because the first step in getting better is to want to get better!

Help others on their journey through this battlefield because even though I understand what you are feeling; only pain comes from leaving. So stay here for the people who care about you and do your best to help them reach a life where they don’t feel this way! You are a King for sharing this and I hope you stay with us for a long time!!!"
