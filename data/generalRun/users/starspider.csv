Just because the spaces are less toxic and hostile than where you were before doesn't mean much. All it means is that you were so acclimated to environments and behavior that are hostile to a female presence that one which is less hostile seems welcoming. If there are still no women, it may be because your group earned a reputation.


Women who make themselves a space in places which have been made hostile to women *will not complain* if they value their time in that space. Complaining historically does not solve anything and so silence is what is chosen.


The point I am making is that these activities on their own are not gendered. You know that penis is not required to enjoy computing, of course. However, historically, society had behaved as if such plumbing were integral. That is mercifully changing.


Telling people that an activity is gendered is only going to keep people behaving and believing that way. The best ways to keep women out of your spaces are to say there are no women here and to make a big deal when they do join.


Making your spaces more inclusive simply widens your social interaction pool and that's a thing most incels definitely need.

>One clever student asks “What lesson can we learn from atheists? Why did God create them?”


>The Master responds “God created atheists to teach us the most important lesson of them all — the lesson of true compassion. You see, when an atheist performs and act of charity, visits someone who is sick, helps someone in need, and cares for the world, he is not doing so because of some religious teaching. He does not believe that god commanded him to perform this act. In fact, he does not believe in God at all, so his acts are based on an inner sense of morality. And look at the kindness he can bestow upon others simply because he feels it to be right.”


>“This means,” the Master continued “that when someone reaches out to you for help, you should never say ‘I pray that God will help you.’ Instead for the moment, you should become an atheist, imagine that there is no God who can help, and say ‘I will help you.’”

There is a prevalence among them of the divorced or widowed, but that is true for all age groups that appear to fall under the category ""elderly"".


The numbers indicate that women think about suicide more often, but men follow through more often. Young people make attempts, but adults are more often successful. LGBT kids are three times more likely to have what's called a ""medically serious"" attempt, and become 2.5x more likely to do so after bullying.


There is speculation that the primary reason for the difference between male and female success rates has more to do with the methods chosen. Poisoning is much less messy, but harder to get correctly. A gun leaves an large amount of cleanup, but has a higher rate of success.

7 in 100,000 youth ages 15 to 19 die by suicide each year. (NIMH)

12.7 in 100,000 young adults ages 20-24 die by suicide each year. (NIMH)

The prevalence of suicidal thoughts, suicidal planning and suicide attempts is significantly higher among adults aged 18-29 than among adults aged 30+. (CDC)

Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death for 15 to 24 year old Americans. (CDC)
Suicide is the 4th leading cause of death for adults ages  18-65. (CDC)

The highest increase in suicide is in males 50+ (30 per 
100,000). (CDC)

Suicide rates for females are highest among those aged 45-54 (9 per 100,000). (CDC)

Suicide rates for males are highest among those aged 75+ (36 per 100,000). (CDC)

Suicide rates among the elderly are highest for those who are divorced or widowed. (SMH)

Gender:

Suicide among males is 4x’s higher than among females. Male deaths represent 79% of all US suicides. (CDC)

Firearms are the most commonly used method of suicide among males (51%). (CDC)

Females are more likely than males to have had suicidal thoughts. (CDC)
 

Females experience depression at roughly 2x’s the rate of men.(SMH)

Females attempt suicide 3x’s as often as males. (CDC)
Poisoning is the most common method of suicide for females. (CDC)



Sexual Orientation/Gender Identity:


Lesbian, gay, and bisexual kids are 3x more likely than straight kids to attempt suicide at some point in their lives.

Medically serious attempts at suicide are 4x more likely among LGBTQ youth than other young people.

African American, Latino, Native American, and Asian American people who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual attempt suicide at especially high rates.

41% of trans adults said they had attempted suicide, in one study. The same study found that 61% of trans people who were victims of physical assault had attempted suicide.

Lesbian, gay, and bisexual young people who come from families that reject or do not accept them are over 8x more likely to attempt suicide than those whose families accept them.

Each time an LGBTQ person is a victim of physical or verbal harassment or abuse, they become 2.5x more likely to hurt themselves.

In my state (Washington) it is your right to carry pepper spray so long as you are at least 14 years old. Taser at 18. Some states actually have very specific rules about your right to use force to defend yourself. Mine is quite liberal but yours may be more strict.

Well, except your parents.


I wanna start off by saying I'm so sorry you went through this and you have every right to be upset. What was done to you was awful and you didn't deserve it.


Neither does your sister, though, and that's the rub. When I read this, I read ""brainwashed child does as she has been taught to do"". Your parents did a real number on her. So big a number that it took at least a full year out of their control before she realized what she had done.


You were both the victims of abuse, and it kills me to see survivors be at odds when they should be able to stick together but abusive parents drive wedged between victim children on purpose to keep you from teaming up to stop abuse.


The people she trusted the most in the world made her believe that this was what she was supposed to do. She did what she was taught was the right thing. Now she's going to have to live the rest of her life knowing that she was betrayed into ruining the most important non-romantic relationship she's going to have as an adult, that with her sibling, and that she watched you get tortured and did nothing.


You're no asshole here. Neither is she.


Not an asshole. But maybe a little self-defeating? Maybe it's time you two talked. For real. In person, cup of coffee. No promises about rekindled family relationships but a chance to come to understand each other and for you to both come to terms with the repercussions of that night.

You know, that stair that's broken and everyone knows to avoid it but nobody does anything about it. It isn't *dangerous* so long as you don't forget to tell someone new to the social circle that its broken. 

But there's always someone new. Like you were.


My favorite thing about being a childhood sex assault survivor is spending my whole life watching people make excuses for not reporting sex offenders. For some reason they always think that *their* confrontation with their rapist was the last one and that *they* set the rapist straight. They never do. Rapists don't give a fuck about other people. That's why they can ignore your ""No"". Your tongue lashing later means exactly what your ""No"" did. Doubly so if they've done it before with no repurcussions.


My second favorite thing is the fact that despite all that, you really can't hold hostility or blame for victims who can't being themselves to report because we see so much coercion not to report. It's made difficult, we are made out to be crazy or for trying to break the group up, being a drama queen, etc.


Woo. Fun times. 



I guess I ask because until his peers (people with dicks--this kind of guy doesn't ever even really attempt to change until other men get involved) kick his ass over this or they do the reporting, nothing will change. He will just wait for a new woman that draws his eye to join the social group and not get told about the broken stair. Maybe someday they'll realize how many girls they thought were crazy and decide that's a really wild number."

Don't actually raise your voice. Everyone grieves differently and some people do it deep inside while lashing out at everyone around them. It causes them to say inappropriate things they later regret sometimes.


That said, that's a *reason* for him to do it, not an *excuse*. He has a reason, and it is not an excusable one. Forgivable? Sure. Excusable? No.



Do talk to him. You've gotten a lot of good advice about pointing out that the couple were married for a year but together for several more. I would add that saying ""I know you're grieving and everything hurts. I'm sorry, but that isn't an excuse to hurt other people and by talking this way about your sister in law, you are diminishing the  your brother's love and therefore memory. Please stop."""
