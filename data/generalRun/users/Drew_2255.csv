facepalm,ff3hwtn,t1_ff3h8rw,1579541397.0,"You can’t just stop killing fish, they are a the main income of so much countries and they’re byproducts like they’re skin can be used in better stuff like bio plastics which are better than regular plastic, this specific bioplastic is biodegrade-able and really cheap because fish skin is considered a waste and thrown in dumps. And also these bioplastics don’t take fossil fuels to make, they are so much cheaper, easier to make and better for the environment. Now I have never seen this type of bioplastic but the ones I have seen/made can be made into hard plastic or bendy plastic and could be used for stuff like water bottles or packaging, since 40% of our plastic use is packaging and only used once I see this to be a really good solution to one of our biggest environmental problems."
facepalm,ff3g7p0,t3_erg2zo,1579540398.0,"You know fish skin is a problem and is basically free, it’s actually really good, better than it sitting in a dump producing methane which is a greenhouse gas, and this is BIOPLASTIC it degrades it won’t pollute anything and can be eaten by animals. This is far better than regular plastic please learn what bioplastics are and how they can help drastically with our pollution and plastic problems. And just cause you are active in r/vegan doesn’t mean you now about environmental problems."
