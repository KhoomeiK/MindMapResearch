You mean an extraordinary amount if you are willing to sacrifice yourself for someone else. That alone makes you better than a lot of people. But I totally get what you are saying."

bangtan,fdnur42,t3_emarh6,1578593245.0,"I am in awe. I watched this before work, and now is the only think I am going to stream today.  hahah   


I AM GOING CRAZY. EVERYONE IS ASLEEP HERE AND MY FRIENDS ON THE EASTCOAST ARE ALL AT WORK. LOL I'm going to continue to freak out until the next trailer. LOL

I love all imaginary, the references, the beat, and the lyrics. I am reminded of his lyrics from The Last where he refers to his fame and idol status as something he must accept. These themes of acceptance and dreams and wants and I'm BREAKING.  


This video. All of these damn visuals had me gasping. I was captivated from the very beginning. The grabbing, the hands, the people under the glass, the cell phones, and the pseudo stage area. They are hyper aware of the whole ""idol culture"" and what it is like. There are so many points that made me want to scream. When everyone broke through the door I wanted to rush in and protect him. I'm sure a lot of you thought the same thing.   


When he first said ""I want to be the king"" I honestly paused. My whole life was on pause. All I could think of was Yoongi getting a Grammy. All I was imagining was Yoongi struggling, but remembering him very happy at NYE in Time Square.   


I truly believe the boys show their true selves, and rarely put on a ""face"". I think this helps their songs to hit so much harder than a normal song.

OR I'm just insane and in love with everything they do. idk. I LOVE YOU ARMY"
AskReddit,fdky8og,t3_elssvy,1578513623.0,"When I was younger I used to think people would transport themselves into the radio. That they would shrink really small down and climb into the radio.  


I used to also think that having sex was basically two people slamming their butts together. When they found the right butt they would keep slamming in some sort of weird buttock harmony. The whole reason people got naked is because they need to see if your butt was a good match for them. People would go around smashing butts with others until they found the correct butt. The one that they could have harmony with forever.   


I was also led to believe that Kiefer Sutherland's name was Queefer Southerlind. My parents got a good laugh when I told them the TV spelled his name wrong."
