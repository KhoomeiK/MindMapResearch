People lose their dignity through poor choices or shoddy circumstances all the time. I can't imagine a world so absolute where that dignity is forever forfeited by nearly any lifestyle let alone a single action. Reparations and reform are nearly always possible in my book.

His clients would come in, for an average of 2-3 minutes and leave with scripts even when they were first time patients. Many paid cash for their visit. He also did brief VOiP ""therapy sessions"" and would write and mail out scripts for those clients. There was only one client who stayed for longer than 5 minutes during my entire 6-8 hour day, it was a kid and his overbearing mom as the last session of the day."

Futurology,fejz3fl,t1_fejr2w8,1579189111.0,"Definitely a lot of propaganda, commonly with a pretty absurd brand of liberal leanings; however, the cities that these programs were first implemented in tend to be places that vote heavily democrat. NYC put fairly widespread facial recognition systems in place in 2008. This comment seems off topic. If you were to make a post about purchasing exposure and votes or using scripts to up visibility, I'd hope you'd at least talk about modern methods rather than just saying Oliver North is upset about internet content aggregators and search engines censoring and prioritizing content.

It's user submitted content and we're voting on it, I don't see what the issue with commenting that, to me, the content doesn't match the values of the sub. It's an article, devoid of substance, baiting clicks with a name brand politician and a total absence of policy discussion, methodology or technical know how."

chicagobulls,fehnrt7,t1_fehlfgq,1579120282.0,"His movement, particularly laterally looks a little wonky and his reactions and defensive instincts fail to impress. He doesn't have much length and it's not like he's particularly oversized for his position. I've seen more bad passes than good ones so far but I've only caught two or three games of the last ten and it's early days. 

He's looking more comfortable out there and the way he moves makes it hard for the opposing defense to predict what he's going to do with the ball. It's hard to say where he'll end up but I definitely don't see star potential yet. So far he has a mindset not dissimilar to Zach's with considerably less talent and physical tools. That's a recipe for disaster although he's got all the time in the world to get it sorted."
Economics,fe3a625,t3_enp4v9,1578847412.0,"I'd agree, but we've seen solid growth in average hourly wage reported. Even when wages are stagnant, low unemployment is still generally going to shift bargaining leverage towards the employee and allow them additional employment choices."
AskReddit,fe0ght9,t3_eng56u,1578813064.0,"In high school me and my buddies started hanging out with a new group of girls. The other girls would tell me or my friends that this one girl would turn down hanging out with her friends to sit on Facebook and wait for me to log on. She'd message me every time I did. She'd randomly drive by my house when she lived multiple miles away. Pretty creepy really. There were multiple times I left my house through the back and cut through yards to friends' houses because of it. A year or two later I got way too drunk and couldn't really function and when pretty much all my friends bailed on me she looked after me and was super appropriate though. And I somehow got talked into taking her to her senior prom as a favor to our mutual friend. I don't really think of her often but as weird as the stalking was I think fairly highly of her.

Also, my friend's girlfriend came over with a couple of her friends one night and we were all drinking. One of her friends started making out with me like an hour into the night and I just went with it. Everyone left the room and I kind of pushed her away. She told me very directly to fuck her and when I told her multiple times I just wanted to find and hang out with my friends she just repeated herself. Eventually, my brain gave up the reigns to my penis and I went with it at the fourth time of asking.

selfimprovement,fdzvoax,t3_engpp4,1578796899.0,"Many people, if not all, experience some discomfort when encountering new and difficult situations. You're certainly not the only one in the world with this problem and as you build relationships and spend more time around people, this will likely become increasingly apparent. I don't know you and I'm going exclusively off of ten sentences, so take the paragraph of armchair psychology for what it's worth... not much. You need to figure out why you're like this and what you can do about it yourself or with a qualified professional.

It sounds like you and your mother took a stance of avoidance as the means of dealing with a series of less than desirable social circumstances. Your comfortable place became where you could learn unhindered by the difficulties of navigating social environments or your emotions that arose from them. Unfortunately, much of life, both personal and professional, requires communication, relationship building, team work and a variety of basic social skills that maybe you've had difficulty developing. Like so many other skills, this is one that can be improved through practice.

Maybe you can go through an entire life avoiding any discomfort or challenge but, is that really the life you want for yourself? Even if you can manage it, you'll likely make countless concessions of fulfillment and growth for the sake of familiarity and comfort.

At the end of the day, life can be difficult and is frequently uncomfortable. There's not much advice for you but to accept your short comings and do what you can to improve on them. Excuse my language but I'd prefer not to sound like a shoe commercial... Just fucking do it and keep doing it isn't really the advice anyone wants to hear but sometimes it's really the only thing for it. Find a therapist you jive with. Find some social gatherings for activities that you enjoy so you can be around people and the only discomfort isn't doing something you're uncomfortable with and rather just being around people. Make an effort to communicate with the people you encounter in your daily life; it might be rocky at first but that's not a big deal, you'll learn how to both be yourself and appropriately react to other people. Get the job and show up. Find proper, healthy coping mechanisms like breathing exercises or physical exercise.

Learn to anticipate thoughts of self-sabotage and be ready with mental frameworks and physical routines to counteract negative or impulsive behavior. Whether you need to take three deep breaths, tell yourself that you can do it, remember a happy memory or a time you pushed through adversity to achieve a meaningful reward, think of something that doing this activity will enable you to do or anything else that works, you need to figure out ways to encourage the kind of positive reaction and self-talk to enable you to overcome these obstacles to personal fulfillment. Maybe you just grit your teeth and bear it and establish a positive, meaningful reward afterwards to associate with that perseverance. Find out what works for you. That's what life is.

You can do it. It probably won't be as easy as you'd like but it will probably be worth it and will almost certainly result in you growing as a human being."
selfimprovement,fdz7lcv,t3_enf9jy,1578787485.0,"I like the saying that hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. Enthusiasm, energy and consistency can get you a long way in life. With that said, it's important to be realistic. Maybe you can be an actress, but there are a lot of people who would also love to be one and will make enormous concessions to try to make it a reality. And then the industry seems to be fairly incestuous at the top among pretty much all of those who actually make a living, and then so much more, off of their acting abilities. 

One way or another, good luck and work hard at what makes you happy."

chicagobulls,fcryxdp,t1_fcrssr8,1577908624.0,"Honestly I think the bulls is a pretty great fit for Zach. Big market, green light, gets to be the number one option like he wants, as good of a team as possible with him as the number one option, team is structured so that they look likely to be relevant for his entire prime, above average training facility and a fan base that he’ll enjoy a lot when they start winning."
chicagobulls,fcrgsb0,t3_eij7k6,1577901632.0,"No. It's hard for fans to objectively evaluate a coach because we see so little of what they do but he seemed basketball savvy, the offense looked fluid, our young players developed and he didn't get anything that even marginally resembled the personnel to fit his system. I think he'd do an average to above average job with this group and would only continue to figure it out. Boylen doesn't get a vote of confidence from me though, he seems in over his head in every aspect besides cultural fit."

We didn’t let people keep their jobs manually sweeping streets because it was easy and mindless and they only had a second grade education.

chicagobulls,fco5owk,t1_fcnpzx5,1577824569.0,"Eh, it's still really up in the air. Even with a really poor start, I could see him finishing with pretty similar per 36 numbers to Dirk at the same age but, crucially, on fewer minutes and less volume.  I don't think he has the type of game where he needs to be the focal point to be one of the best players in the league. It'd keep him from being a generational talent like Dirk but definitely not from being an all star."
chicagobulls,fco4i1u,t1_fcnfbc8,1577823920.0,"Ya, what if. He played like ass to start, it's good that he's playing well now but he needs to do it consistently. We don't really need to force him to take on a major load just yet and his lack of involvement has so much more to do with Zach and team make-up than Boylen in my opinion. Once we get Otto back I think the team will be good enough that Zach will see the need to play team ball. Right now we just don't really have the pieces and both Zach and Lauri are mediocre at best in the pick and roll and Zach just isn't a great passer. It's hard enough for him to drive and kick but you put Dunn or Hutch on the floor with him and you just added another defender to close passing lanes and he's going to up his turnovers trying to find Lauri. Otto gives him what he needs to try and make it happen more and hopefully he'll improve with time."
chicagobulls,fcnis0p,t1_fcnftqo,1577812514.0,"Ya, Dunn understands that making things work for Lauri can be an enormous amount of his offensive value and a way he gets extra time on the floor and with the starters. 

Unfortunately Zach doesn't seem to appreciate that if he can find a way to kick it out to Lauri or Sato in a corner on more of his drives he's going to face a lot fewer contests by multiple defenders at the rim. If you've got Lauri's defender in good position to contest the shot you're not going to get the foul from the on ball defender as often too. He could improve his finishing at the rim so much by looking to set up the drive and kick. He needs to grow a lot as a player if we're going to be a good team, he just doesn't have quite enough talent to be the kind of player he seems hell-bent on being. He could possibly grow into an all-nba player, but it's not going to happen without finding ways to create more for the team."

AskReddit,fc5qnv0,t3_ega9qc,1577463853.0,"I'll write what I can think of. Read as much as you want, I think it's fairly helpful stuff.

Don't use multiple pieces of equipment at one time, unless you're going to be quick (< 7-8 minutes), and if you do, keep it to two. Watch out for anyone trying to use either and if you see anyone who might want to, offer to let them""work in"" (do their exercises in between your sets).

If you have the ability to vary it up, do so. Don't just work on strength and don't just work on cardio. If you're not very out of shape I'd recommend yoga once a week. Circuit training can be a great way to incorporate the consistently elevated heart rate levels associated with cardio and still get strength gains. Circuit training is excellent for burning calories.

Exrx.net is horribly formatted for beginners but you can find short demonstration videos for virtually every exercise in one place. Do some quick research on anatomy and common workout splits and it should be a solid resource.

All sorts of people use the gym, but we're all there for one reason, self-improvement. As long as you're doing that you're not going to have problems with anyone and if you happen to, take it up with the staff. They can mediate.

You can't outwork a bad diet unless you're an exceptional athlete and even then a diet that doesn't fit your needs will catch up to you quickly. Your 45 minute jog doesn't entitle you to a piece of cake unless you're trying to go backwards. Cooking all your own food is a great way to eliminate processed foods and calorie control but if you're not seeing the results you're looking for, start counting calories until you get an idea what you're consuming.

If you want long term results, this needs to be a long term lifestyle change. Find some music that you like and that motivates you, find a time that works for you and don't frame your workout as a chore. You're healthy enough to exercise and it comes with some incredible health benefits, it's a privilege that shouldn't be taken for granted. Some people would give anything for the opportunity you have. If you hate your time in the gym, consider changing routines. If you hate swimming, jogging, circuit training, band work, plyometrics, HIIT workouts, conventional resistance training, yoga, pilates, cycling etc... You may need to look into why you have that sort of relationship with exercise and your body. What I'm trying to say is there's something for just about everyone out there.

On a similar note, stick with it. Frequency is the biggest contributor to results. Start off slow so that you don't make it physically difficult to keep coming back. Do a little bit more each week. When your body really hurts, it's okay to take a day off. I don't mean if your joints ache because you're overweight, I mean if your muscles are sore from unweighted movement.

Stretch after leg workouts and take 5-10 minutes to walk around and maybe do mobility stuff before you get in the car. It can drastically reduce soreness for the next day. 

That's mostly all I've got. I hope you find a way to enjoy your time at the gym even a tenth as much as I do because it'll be life changing."
massage,fc5msbk,t1_fc54tx1,1577461691.0,"The first part's exactly how I meant, I guess I didn't segue well. I was taught that the words deep tissue are a marketing strategy rather than a modality and don't refer to anything specific. That's been my experience, and many of my peers, as well, it could refer to any number of unrelated techniques, spa treatments etc. So it's just easier to talk about pressure which we can probably all agree is something that can be described as force / (time \* surface area)."
Economics,fc4syzx,t1_fc495qc,1577427247.0,"I'm not positive, not an expert at all, but I'd imagine that generally it would lead to greater demand for mortgage bonds and other types of mortgage backed securities. This would incentivize commercial banks to issue mortgages to consumers despite low interest rates and investment banks to create these bonds and securities because they have a ready made buyer. This is important because according to the BEA the industries termed ""Finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing; finance and insurance; real estate and rental and leasing"" constitute about 48% of the US economy. I'd imagine it also contributes to a lower interest rate and inflation to some extent. So, I think, it subsidizes important industries at the cost of dollar strength. The question is are we at a point in the economic cycle where we want to be incentivizing these activities at this cost? The answer is hopefully not although inflation has been pretty moderate outside of equity markets even as the money supply has tripled in three years. Change in contribution to GDP by the industries most affected by this sort of activity has been been pretty steadily positive over the two year period we've been offloading these assets. The fed still has 1.7 trillion worth of them on their balance sheet though not to mention another almost 2 trillion in treasury securities. I'd imagine that the former leads to an inflow of interest income from individual investment banks in exchange for taking on the risk of holding these assets, which in some ways appears to be a way to pool risk, while the latter leads to an inflow of income from the treasury and I'd think contributes to lower bond yields. All of this gets a pretty huge asterisk next to it though as I'm pretty uncertain about the mechanisms by which the Fed actually purchases these assets and I'm not certain enough about the structural organization of the FOMC to say for sure."

massage,fc1v2sk,t1_fc1s40e,1577330627.0,"I'm not commenting on quality of massage, just physical tools. I've had at least as many good massages, as a proportion, from women as men. 

Even at 6'2 and 190 pounds there are rare times where I'm using an elbow on the lowest table setting. There's literally nothing I can do except speed up strokes if that pressure is insufficient. I'm not trying to do rapid strokes in a super deep lunge with an elbow, it seems negligent and unlikely to feel good. A 5'1,100 pound woman could absolutely get sufficient pressure on me with proper body mechanics and knuckles but a 6'3 210 pound guy could probably do it with shit body mechanics and a forearm. I don't take particularly deep pressure though. Doesn't make the guy a better massage therapist, it just makes him more likely to serve a specific demographic. Maybe I'm wrong and it's 50/50 in terms of number or proportion of each gender uncomfortable with deep pressure but if we conducted a poll and that was the result, I'd be very surprised, not to mention it hasn't been remotely close to my anecdotal experience."
massage,fc1r30g,t1_fc12t4e,1577327032.0,"I've been one for 5 and only met one male LMT uncomfortable with deep pressure. Really he was just trying to avoid wear and tear on his body. I've met a couple dozen women. I've probably met between half again and double as many female LMTs but still. I'm happy to advocate for the female LMT's who are comfortable with deep pressure, and often have, as I've met absolutely plenty capable of accommodating any pressure level; however, men are, on average, 5 inches taller, stronger and 30 pounds heavier. Leverage, weight, force production, speed of stroke and surface area of the tool you're using are basically the exclusive components of what we call pressure. Some of the best massage therapists I've met are women but I don't really see how it's contentious to say women are more likely to experience difficulty accommodating deep pressure. If I was 5'1 and 100 pounds I'd have a lot of difficulty accommodating pressure. If I were 6'3, 210 pounds and slim I could choose virtually any tool to achieve the desired pressure on nearly all clients. There are virtually no men in the former category and virtually no women in the latter category."
