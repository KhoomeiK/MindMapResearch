Advice,ffsk8ht,t3_euwktg,1580183760.0,"Why please other people? Its not like they’ve done anything for you.

Honestly they should fuck off with the peer pressuring. You’re a free person and should be able to do whatever you want. Its not like you’re gonna hangout with them after you graduate."
Advice,ffsju15,t3_euyssy,1580183469.0,"Honestly this might be rude but I think she might be just self loathing for attention especially if shes done it publicly?  She just wants a reaction outta people.

I think you should leave this relationship slowly. Just stop engaging in conversation and eventually die out.  Seems like a very toxic person that just wants to drag you down along with her."
Advice,ffsjc6z,t3_euzhwt,1580183111.0,"You can stop and go back when ever you want. I was in comp sci too. Miserable and dropped out. It wasn’t something I wanted to do til I was 65.

Now I own an online business thats makes a insane amount. Like 10x my old paycheck. But the thing about online stuff, trends die down and you can’t do it forever so don’t rely on your whole future on a tik tok career. 

With the money I make, I saved it for schooling later (I’m doing autobody now) . Don’t go splurging on designer shit and brand new cars or youll end up back at square one working at best buy when you’re 30 after the tiktok money is gone."

Advice,ffq2q0e,t1_ffpcuqm,1580117145.0,This girl is so pathetic. I hope OP walks out with dignity and doesn’t drag it out longer than it has to. Really?? Staying in a hotel with another guy and lying about it. YIKES TALK ABOUT RED FLAGS.

Instagramreality,ffkwtor,t1_ffimcg2,1580030423.0,"I thought this hair color was achievable when I was 19 (starting from black hair to silver). 

I bleached and toned my hair to the color that OP hairdresser posted and my hair ended up falling off in chunks. LOL OOP- took another 2 years to finally recover from that disaster."
saskatoon,ffki7oi,t1_ffift5t,1580023185.0,"Well I think people buy a brand new car and think they have job security, lose their job to unfortunate events. End up being behind on bills then fail to make payments.

You only need to miss 2-3 payments before the dealership/bank sends the private investigator to locate your car to get repo’d."
saskatoon,ffhpgle,t3_etohaf,1579946919.0,What a couple of bozos. Bet they are the type of guys who get their truck repo’d by ashley low investigations. LOL. God theres so many trucks there.
IllegalLifeProTips,ffeoab0,t1_ffdxm9y,1579857095.0,"Paint thinner so hard to fix. You would have to sand down the whole section of the car and then repaint the primer, paint and gloss on top. A whole car to paint coats 5k-10k depending on what model the car is. 

Just go around the car with paint thinner, one big phat line across both sides.Don’t waste time just going over one section."
saskatoon,ffbca45,t3_eqhgnn,1579759378.0,I live in massey since I was born. I only got my home attempted to be broken into back in 2010 by some crack head. Otherwise theres not really much crime happening.
