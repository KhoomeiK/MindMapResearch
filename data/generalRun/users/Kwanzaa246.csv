Swimming,fcwbr84,t1_fcof7n9,1578021733.0,Your diet is primarily responsible for your cholesterol. Look into low carb diets and try one. Your performance will suffer as low carb diets don't offer as much athletic explosiveness but your body will be much healthier .
Swimming,fcwb72d,t3_eilqje,1578021367.0,"Muscle growth happens in the recovery phase. The faster you recover the faster muscle growth happens. You can't compromise muscle growth by recovering faster. Quick recovery indicates you are fit. 

As for recovering quick the few things you can do are 

1) eat a ton of good quality food and be in a caloric surplus. Don't eat shit from 7/11. Get your mom cooking you that nutritious shit. Eat steak and eggs for breakfast. Steak and rice for lunch and steak salad for dinner. Protein is important for recovery and fat is a close second. Carbs are useless for recovery and only useful for performance. 

2) sleep as much as you feel like, take naps, sleep in.

3) do active recovery. Light walks or jogs, yoga, bodyweight exercises like air squats and pullups. Not enough to fatigue the muscles, just to keep blood moving

beyond that there's not much to do. If your can't recover then it's to much workload for you right now. And thats ok"

todayilearned,fcn1iup,t1_fcmpjlb,1577800585.0,"But isn't 7mSV in 1 second much more significant than 20 over 365 days? 

I visualize it as a piece of paper with water dripping on it. If you drip 20mSV over 365 days the paper has time to dry and ""fix"" itself.

Of you dump 7mSV on it in at once the paper will more likely rip due to the force of water hitting it all at once 

As for radiographers doing what the can do reduce dosages, that's true in western countries but several of my CT scans where done in third world countries due to emergency situation and they do things alot less carefully (ie not covering the genitals and scanning them)

Radiology,fc6nj63,t1_fc6d7sg,1577484809.0,"Radiation hormesis seems to specify dosages are safe that fall in line with common medical imaging scans .

It routinely quotes dosages  <5cGY to <10cGY pose no additional risk. Assuming this is a cumulative dosage, it means people are good for 4-5 CT scans and shouldn't worry until then. 

One thing I may be mis understanding is the dosage quoted in radiation hormesis is not effective dose but total dosage. 

Ie in a CT abdom the dosage applied is ~400mGY-cm with an effective dose of ~7mSV. Is radiation hormesis refering to effective dose or applied dose, if it's applied dose then radiation hormesis would provide that medical imaging should be treated very carefully and not so liberally as it currently is"
