TrueChristian,febhn78,t1_febghbm,1578958868.0,"Well I pray all the time. Before I go to bed and after I get up. When I’m in the car, before I get out of the car, while I’m in between classes or on break at work, and before I read the Bible. I always pray to be closer to Him, for a stronger relationship, that he would increase my love and faith in Him, that I will be increasingly obedient day by day and sanctified in the image of Christ. I pray also that my desire for sin will be extinguished and replaced with a love of walking in the Spirit. I feel these are good things to pray for but I always feel closer to Him when I haven’t succumbed to sin (like porn or gossip, my two most entangling sins). I know feelings aren’t everything but still."
