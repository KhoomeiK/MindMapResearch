I recently helped a friend do a frequency count on a .csv that’s north of 5 million rows long and 50 columns wide. I wrote a simple generator function to read said csv, then update the count on a dict. It finished in 30 seconds on my 2015 rMBP while he spent 15 minutes going through the first million of rows on his consumer-grade Dell.

I simply told him: having an SSD helps a lot. Heh heh."
gtaonline,ff9ydkq,t1_ff97ocu,1579724166.0,"My crew loves to do sales in populated lobbies, and usually there’d be 2-3 armed escorts per vehicle, plus a jet and/or heli and a guy standing by at the orbital cannon console as our eyes in the sky. If it happens to be a 1-vehicle sale, then we’d guard that one vehicle to death.

I’ve had an occasion where a nightclub sale was guarded by a couple of Insurgents, a Khanjali, probably 3 Broomsticks of Death, an Akula and a couple of Lazers. A few lowlevel punks tried doing funky stuff with drive-by sticky bombs and whatnot, and of course they ended up suffering the wrath of the escorts."

todayilearned,ff8mryy,t1_ff8htiv,1579686325.0,"A few months ago, my late grandma had a heart attack in the wee hours of the morning. We called an ambulance and had her hauled to a hospital not even 10km away from our house. Cost? Equal to $1000.

That said, apart from the crazy ambulance bill, everything else is cheap. I’ve been to the ER for a very bad respiratory infection — to the point of having a sharp, piercing pain on my back and shoulder blades everytime I cough — and walked away with a $30 bill which included doctor’s visit and very potent antibiotics. 2 days later, I’m back on my feet.

And that’s Indonesian healthcare for ya. Which, apart from the crazy ambulance fees, makes me grateful that I’m not American."

Personally I use the XB controller on PC and the three things that has become muscle memory to me: snack, body armor and enable/disable passive. It also helps that the Interaction Menu is very fluid and responsive on PC, whereas it has this weird, slight lag on PS4."

FWIW, I’ve driven a friend’s chipped 528i with full Eisenmann exhaust in Jakarta. That thing was eerily quiet on the inside, even when I was going 220+ kph in sport mode. But once he dropped me off at a mall and left the premises, holy fuck did it sound like a slightly less angrier M4.

I run Ubuntu Server on production and thanks to this, I got to learn `diff`ing and `patch`ing conf files that would get replaced. The way I'd do it is that I'd drop into a shell, `diff`, examine things for deprecated configs and such, `patch` new stuff into the old file, then go back to the updater and tell it to 'keep the existing file'."
