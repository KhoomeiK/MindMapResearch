You probably know more autistic people than you think, and they don't tell you because even though they are fully functioning adults, they will still be labeled as stupid once someone knows they're autistic."

dogs,fgadbr6,t3_ex95th,1580649895.0,Oooh! What a smart dog he is/will be. Collies and German Shepherds are both very intelligent and loyal. You could teach that dog anything and he would be happy to do it! Such a sweet face too. I'm glad you found the perfect dog for you:)
AskReddit,fga5vz3,t1_fg8bc8c,1580647093.0,"When I was in middle school, I had detention a lot. And for some reason, only on Saturday mornings, the toilet water was always really hot. Like you said, I didn't touch the toilet water but there was a lot of heat radiating from it. It was always cold in the school so I would ask to go to the bathroom and just sit on the toilet for a while because it was nice and warm."

Anxiety,ffu9px1,t3_ev758t,1580237435.0,"House-Training. Your dog needs a routine when learning when and where to use the bathroom. Crate- training him is a great first step because he will spend some time there. Keep your dog in his crate but take him out at certain times of the day, take him immediately outside, tell him to go potty once you get outside. Say it encouragingly multiple times, and right after he goes, give him tons of love and pats and tell him what a good boy he is! Spend time playing with him and teaching him new commands while you guys are outside, and try to tire him out so he is more calm when he is back in the house. Keep an eye out so if you see him sniffing about like he needs to go to the bathroom you can take him outside. Keep his free time in the house to a minimum while you are getting him into a good routine though. He needs to recognize that its time to potty when he goes outside at these times, and his body will grow accustomed to going at those times of day. The less room he has for error, the easier house training is. You can probably find a good feeding and bathroom routine for him if you Google it. 

Instead of saying no when teaching him things, say a firm ""ah-ah"" (look up ""its me or the dog"" for a good example of that command. Its sharp and loud and easier to understand. He should recognize that as stop/no pretty early on.

Crate training can be hard for a dog that has separation anxiety, but it is crucial to treating separation anxiety. It can be knocked out quickly if you are patient and firm. Have a crate that is big enough for him to stand and lay in but not enough for him to be able to walk about. He should be able to turn around and stuff of course, but a dog won't go to the bathroom in a crate because they would have to lay on or right next to it and dogs don't want that. Keep this crate in the same place for now. Once he is fully crate trained it won't matter. Put a comfortable bed or blankets in the crate, and a blanket on top of it, with one side exposed of course. Tire your dog out first, play or go for a long walk, and then try luring him in with treats while at the same time repeating ""crate time"" or whatever you choose that will be short and convenient to say, because its how you will eventually tell your dog its time to get in his crate. Don't force him into the crate, and go at his own pace. Once he is in, tell him He's a good boy and give him more treats and pet him to try and distract him a little from being in an unfamiliar space. If he comes back out repeat this again and close the crate once he seems more calm. Give him a few more treats and tell him he's a good boy. Do some stuff in his sight like clean the room or do homework or just anything where the focus is not on him. Talk to him occasionally and tell him he's a good boy etc.   Then after a little while, just casually walk out of the room. Don't say anything, don't tell him you'll be back or make any deal out of it, just leave everything and walk out. Only leave for a few minutes, even if he barks or cries the whole time. Set an exact time and don't come back til that time is up. When you come back, tell him he's a good boy and give a small treat. He will eventually learn that you will come back and he will calm down. If he doesn't it may be a deeper issue that can be solved with a professional trainer.

Another thing you can look into for his anxiety is calming chews. Ask your vet for a good non-prescription product and give those to him before leaving him home alone. You could also distract him with a Kong with treats inside for him to stay busy while you're not home.

Dogs need lots of reassurance and positive reinforcement while they are learning! Training is also a bonding experience and your dog will trust and listen to you more with time and patience. I'm tired so idk if this is worded well. Feel free to ask questions if you want to know more. I know how stressful it can be to have a new dog. Nothing works for everyone, but the things I said above work for a lot of dog owners! I'm sorry you're having a hard time. I hope I can help!"
AskReddit,fftyyaj,t3_eutai7,1580230772.0,"All of these answers of people adulting are making me so sad because I feel like the living embodiment of shoving school papers in my backpack with no binder/folder. My thoughts are disorganized, I'm depressed, I don't remember what I did even yesterday because I'm riddled with anxiety that keeps me constantly worried about the future, I'm unemployed and want to die but won't do anything about it because my mom would be sad. :)"
HomeCams,ffpk64t,t1_ffpicai,1580097008.0,"I'm not an expert but I heard it happens a lot. Could be a last fight for survival or a blood loss thing, but its common that if they're had a traumatic injury that they'll ask for water shortly before they die. And healthcare professionals won't give any fluids until they know exactly what the problem is in case consuming anything could make matters worse."

AmItheAsshole,ffp67w1,t3_eu903q,1580087264.0,"NTA! But also I would like to say, a written will is more for money and belongings rather than funeral stuff, and wills aren't usually even looked at until after a burial or cremation. I would go to the extent of getting a lawyer, but I know that costs money.you may need to talk to them about your will so they all know every detail of what you want and are aware that the will includes how you would like your funeral to go. I don't really know what to say to someone who is dying and knows it, but I hope you're doing as well as you can be and that the days you have left are full of love and happiness. I don't think I could cope with the information that you've had to accept as reality. You're a strong one. Good job:)"
interestingasfuck,ffp217x,t1_ffp1j25,1580084589.0,"They qualify. ESA's don't have to be trained to do a particular job. It's inconvenient, and it'd be way easier on them and everyone else if they had an animal that could at least be trained to behave in public, like a dog or cat or even a pig, and maybe the lawmakers fucked up on that one, but yeah if that animal brings comfort to the person purposely or not and their therapist signed off on it, it qualifies and is doing what it's intended to."

interestingasfuck,ffp0iyd,t1_ffoz5h4,1580084035.0,Emotional support animals aren't allowed everywhere. They are allowed on airplanes and in hotels and apartments with no pets policies. That is all. And they are very helpful to people with anxiety and depression who don't qualify as disabled but their animal gives them something to focus on to alleviate their anxieties and feelings of loneliness.
AskReddit,ffgm0vm,t3_etcyd6,1579909356.0,"I know this will get buried but I really really want people to know. Ask the men in your life how they're doing. Don't tell them they're too emotional, or that they can tough through whatever is going on. Listen to them and remind them how important they are to you. My best friend committed suicide last year. His friends mom told me that he was overemotional and was the ""girl of the relationship"" when I was friends with her family years ago. I was the only person in his life who he felt comfortable sharing his thoughts and feelings with because I didn't judge him for being sad and needing a shoulder to cry on. He always told me that I was really cool and it was just because I was there when he needed me and I let him tell me how he felt, completely uncensored. He had a lot of problems that could've been resolved if he felt like he could get help without being bullied by his ""friends"", and I know he is at peace now. If my love for him could've saved him though, he would still be here. The crazy thing is, everyone else in his life said they didn't know how bad he felt or that it could get to this point. But I knew because I asked and I listened. Rest easy, Izaac. You were the best person to ever walk into my life."

obgyn,ffent8e,t3_et7js2,1579856389.0,"Do what the other person said, but are you sexually active? My hair is really thick and will fall down into my butt crack after showering, and there have been a couple times where I've had sex after a shower and have pulled a long hair or two out of my vagina and my boyfriend has pulled them off of himself as well. That might explain the hair, and possibly the irritation, but do go to the hospital if the pain is that bad, and make an appointment with your obgyn."

AskReddit,ffcrt92,t3_esr647,1579805944.0,"Public speaking. Its strange because usually people with anxiety just avoid it altogether. I hate the build up to it. I worry for weeks. If I start a class and find out public speaking will be involved ill try to transfer to another class even. I feel like I'm gonna pass out the whole time. But then I crush it every time. Not a single stutter, I project my voice when I need to, I make eye contact with everyone somehow. Idk. I hate the shit out of it though and I would be 100% okay with never doing it again."
