It seems like a waste to throw away all that great planning you did, it is a big compliment that she loves everything you chose. I don't really see why it would be that big of a deal. It's just a wedding, and she is trying to make the best of a bad situation. I doubt you will use that wedding dress again if you get married and you cant return it.  So why not let your sister have it. It sounds like a great way to turn a sore spot into something positive.

It is called grooming and it is usually a precursor or red flag for other behaviors. It is far from beating the crap out of women but it is inches from pedophilia. Do you think it is cool for a guy his age to be best friends with a 15 year old girl? He does not have any 15 year old guy friends.
BrandNewSentence,fdeo0gs,t1_fdefxcs,1578343042.0,From what I know its all about demand. People just don't want redheaded kids. My guess is because most people who do IVF want kids that look like they do. They want the kid to look like their kid or at least like they could be their kid. And gingers are a minority and some people don't like gingers. When I donated I was about 2 years past the age maximum at the hospital where I donated (each one is different) but I am pretty healthy and there was probably a demand for blondes where I donated.  They asked for a few childhood photos and then they show the IVF parents the different photos and they pick their donor from the photos.
