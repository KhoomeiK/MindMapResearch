None.

>What lives--and poops--in the pond?

Pond is underneath an apple tree and a bird feeder. It gets apple leaves, the occasional rotting apple, bird poop, the odd peanut or barley. It has a good population of pond weed and pond snails. It is fed by rainwater.

So, don't let him at the dog food. Making a habit of eating it could seriously harm his health very quickly.

If you put out cat food there are a couple of issues that you should be aware of: first, he has a collar and therefore, probably, an owner, an owner who is wondering why he won't eat; and secondly, he may have medical problems or be on a diet that you don't know about and which you are royally messing up by feeding him. 

One solution might be to ask around your neighbourhood and see if you can find his owner. They might be horrified at what their cat is up to, they might be grateful, it's worth finding out. If you think he might be lost, put up a few ads locally asking if he's lost or just an opportunist.
