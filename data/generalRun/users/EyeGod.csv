If you were to put a 20 year old boomer & millennial in a cage fight, who do you think would win?

We’re a bunch of fucking whining crybabies; we don’t know shit about suffering; we’re whelping because our measure of success is that of our grandparents’ & because the world has changed & we can’t replicate that success now, we blame them for all of it. 

Surely, they do bear some responsibility, but god are we entitled."
books,ffzcgyn,t3_evnbkv,1580372161.0,"Wow, man. This post gave me goosebumps... 

I haven't read The Road in forever. I first read it prior to the film's release, to prep myself for it (filmmaker here who loves to read the book before watching the adaptation to see how the filmmakers approached the material), but I loved post-apocalyptic fiction/settings, so I was intrigued from the first word.

What struck me about the minimalist prose was almost how it reflected that people had stopped communicating, especially in writing.

Furthermore - and perhaps the biggest takeaway from it - is how soft my generation (Y/Millennial) is, and how we can't hold a candle to our parents/grandparents, which is pretty terrifying: which skills do we possess that we can pass on to our children? And I mean basic survival skill. And is it our fault for being disinterested, or the fault of our parents and their parents before them?

I don't rightly know... perhaps it is ironically the excesses of living through the longest times of relative peace in the world... On an aside, I'm currently listening to Dan Carlin's [Blueprint for Armageddon](https://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-50-blueprint-for-armageddon-i/), which recounts the history of World War I, and it's hard to come to terms with the coming of age a whole generation of teenage boys/young men had to endure. 

My generation knows nothing about the real harshness, not only of life, the human condition or human nature, but the very fabric of nature itself, and The Road very much touches on that in a big, terrifying way."

DeathStranding,ffwpm81,t3_evkuwg,1580307908.0,I’m surprised Kojima isn’t in it himself.
prey,ffwhnk0,t1_ffwg5tb,1580301337.0,"Play on the hardest difficulty with survival options enabled.

Or, if hard intimidates you, the highest you're prepared to go, but with survival options enabled for sure; it adds so much value.

Also, try the No Needles play through: that is, no neuromods, so no powers. It's immensely rewarding.

EDIT: I guess this isn't really advice for anyone new to the game, but rather those who wish to squeeze some real good juice out of the game."
prey,ffwhj53,t3_evltxm,1580301216.0,"I wanted to say ""meh, old news"", but fuck it: discovering things in this game - whether it was at launch, or right now - is simply amazing.

Have fun, and remember: half the fun is in the replay and trying out different things.

(God, every time I read or reply to one of these threads I just want to boot up Prey and play again!)"

dune,ffw7s7c,t1_ffw77rl,1580288402.0,"Yeah, you nailed it. Since film is a visual medium they can really go to town with some great battles an build the legend of Muad’dib by showing him as this prophesied, great military leader despite his youth. 

Sure, it’s glossed over in the books, but this is a film, an adaptation & a visual medium. This will be what people are signing up for & also an opportunity for Villeneuve & co to put their own creative stamp on it whilst still staying true to the ethos of the books. I trust him to handle it well & imagine that they’ve put a lot more thought in to it than we can even begin to realize through speculation on Reddit."

dune,ffw5moz,t1_ffw5c0u,1580285431.0,"Yeah, came here to say just that... Could even just be ""The Prophet""...

It'll be a big call on behalf of the marketing team, because branding is so important, but if this movie ends up being as big as its potential, I think they could totally get away with MUAD'DIB or PROPHET... Though PROPHET OF DUNE probably is the safest bet. Also nice that it sounds like ""Prophet of Doom."" Heh."
