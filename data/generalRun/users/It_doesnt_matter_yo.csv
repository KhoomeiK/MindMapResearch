They are more concerned with their problems and lives/careers/children.

What makes sense now, won’t make sense in the future. What makes sense in the future, won’t make sense now. 

Everything is temporary.

My advice - don’t do drugs, save money, but not to much (have some fun and take that trip to Spain), your body won’t be at 40 what it is at 25, no one gives a fuck about you other than family (sometimes they don’t either), whatever you do go in 100% and expect nothing back."
