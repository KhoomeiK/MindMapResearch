So they cut corners until what they get is garbage they still can't afford. You offer them black and white on a color stock because that's eye catching, the paper is recycled, and it costs pennies a sheet. Nope. Gotta be full color heavy glossy stock mailers like the spam mail they throw away without a thought to how much that costs at such low quantities. And you can tell their graphic design intern volunteer really cares about their work and wants to build a portfolio, but focused on web design in school and has no idea how printing works."
YangForPresidentHQ,ffyzvzj,t1_ffygtqd,1580359566.0,"I disagree. The media will give someone like them a platform to suite a narrative or as clickbait because of the wild nature of the opinion. They're used. They're not authorities or leaders. They don't have influence.

When people were still figuring out how the internet works with activism there were a lot of people easily following some mega woke influencer  who seemed to be saying important things. People quickly realized those people were just out for attention so they stopped following and left them to only ever get small crowds of kids or the really gullible or like-minded wannabe celebrities.

Again I want to point out that because these people are taken advantage of by the media, their opinions are made to seem more widespread if that's the narrative of that media, and the current trend for conservative media is to pretend these people are major players and voices and not just some nobody on the internet who got an insignificant number of likes inflated by bots."

Also blues, along with those other two, have a silver blue sheen due to their fur being a deep gray on one end and white on the other, making then almost shiny.

Blues can be a deep gray blue or a lighter gray. The kittens have blue eyes that turn more green. They might have very dull stripes you can't see in certain lights. Gray cats were at a time considered a good gift for newlyweds because they tend to bond very closely with one or two people and then not care for anyone else.

I had two a long time ago and thought about getting another, but the two cats I have now are more affectionate than any I've had before.

Thisismylifemeow,ffj2gme,t3_etrgdz,1579988715.0,"Dear dog owners:

 stop being surprised at cats that play fetch. Most of them do. They just enjoy it for slightly different reasons than dogs. Cats vision makes them attracted to moving things so to play with something they will sometimes rely on a human to throw it, but will just as often throw things in the air themselves. They don't regularly bring them back because that aspect of fetch isn't as important to them. If they want you to throw it though they will. My cats like toys on a string and will bring them to me so I can make them move. Then when they're done playing they'll either stop chasing it, sit on it, or pull it away and drop it somewhere else.

Think of it as an introverted friend who is shy and awkward about working together and when you're done with something or a conversation they will just wander off not sure of how to explain that they've reached their capacity for socializing. Similarly cats consider simply existing in the same general space as a social activity. So a cat that doesn't seem to want to sit with you but sits near you is being friendly. They just need their personal space."
