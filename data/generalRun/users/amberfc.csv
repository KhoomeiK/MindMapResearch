KingPrincess,fetk2v0,t3_eqk5jn,1579376217.0,I got to the venue at 3 and I was like third in line for VIP maybe in the first ten overall. I was able to get right in the middle at barricade once they let VIP in. I think the first girl there got there around 11 but it definitely wasn’t necessary to get a good spot. It didn’t really get crowded until maybe 4:30 or 5.

insaneparents,fdtybuu,t1_fdtmgs6,1578724236.0,"My mother is exactly like this. As I was reading the texts I legitimately could picture my mother doing exactly this. It’s honestly terrible. It’s so suffocating and is like gaslighting because your parent insists that they’re trying to protect you and have your best interests at heart but they’re actually killing you. It honestly almost lead to my suicide because I could not take my mother controlling my entire life like that any more. And at the same time I feel terrible for feeling this way about my parent. I’ll add some stories for anyone interested in just a few of the things she’s done. 

When I was in 8th grade my mom took my iPod away which meant that I’d be totally isolated but I wanted my friend to keep my snap streaks so I gave her my log in. While my mom had my iPod she went through everything including my messages and saw that I had given my friend my log in info. She then forced me to tell her all of my log in information for all of my accounts and changed the passwords. From then on I had to ask her to log me into things if I wanted to use them. In high school she also installed a parental control program on my laptop called K9 that wouldn’t let me use a regular internet browser. The only one that worked was their special super safe and secure and censored one. 

Also in high school she forced me to get Life360 on my phone and turned on her notifications so she could see every update. It told her literally everything, my phone battery, my location, my driving (top speed, route I took, any sudden stops or speeding up a lot, etc.). To get around it I tried turning off data for the app but she would go and check and call/text me a million times asking why it wasn’t working and wouldn’t allow me to do anything if she thought it wasn’t working properly. If I tried to get around that by leaving my phone somewhere and I happened to miss a call I would get in trouble. One time after coming home from ski team she told me she could watch my location go up and down the mountain. A different time my senior year I went on a school field trip to a hiking area where we were going to do some creative writing. She had signed my permission slip for the trip a week earlier but when she got the notification that I had left school she started calling me. She freaked out and started yelling at me accusing me of skipping classes even though I had literally never once skipped class. This happened while I was on the bus. It was a small bus and pretty much everyone heard the whole thing...  


One time in my second semester of college I was exhausted after getting out of class and decided to take a nap. I forgot that I told her I would call her two days before. At 7:40 pm both my roommate and I woke up from our naps to knocks on our door from an RA and THE POLICE. My mother had called me 13 times and sent me a bunch of messages freaking out thinking I had been murdered or something. When we opened the door the RA and police told us that my mom called the RAs office twice which lead to them calling the police. She told them she hadn’t heard from me in days even though we had texted briefly earlier that day. She’s now called the police on me again and threatened to call them several other times.

Now I am an emotionally stunted adult because I cannot bear to impose on other people in any way and I have terrible anxiety and trust issues. Plus I don’t talk to my mom anymore."
Chipotle,fdtut5z,t3_en3dg7,1578722557.0,"I wasn’t there for all of these but I know for a fact they are true 

1. I had a pretty typical GM who wouldn’t do anything and hung out in the office. He would make up excuses that he was sick quite often to get the AP and SM’s to do his work for him. When the store hit a rough patch he repeatedly would purposely not take medication and pass out just to avoid doing his job. One time he didn’t time it well and ended up passing out while he was on line with a customer. The store closed at 8 that day. 

2. Had a coworker who was clearly on serious drugs. He was superrr jittery and weird and he talked nonstop. The way his body moved was so unsettling that I felt sick to my stomach. He told us he was 27 but he looked like he was 43 and was super racist and sexist. He would go to the bathroom like 11 times a shift and would occasionally rip a huge sheet of tinfoil to bring with him. I transferred away from that store so idk if he’s still there but I can’t believe my old GM was willing to put up with his erratic behavior. 

3. This isn’t really a horror story it’s just weird - sometimes the fire alarm will go off in the store but it happens pretty often and it’s always a false alarm or a problem in some other part of the large building so the crew knows to just keep working and ignoring it. I have never in a year and a half seen even one customer question the fire alarm or hesitate to walk in... 

4. One time after close there was a homeless man outside who was stumbling around and after a while he started acting like he was fighting someone and eventually ended up against the window hitting it a bunch and our manager had us all stand in the office until he was sure the guy was gone 

5. At one of the stores I worked at we were extremely understaffed and as a result the FL would often come work shifts to help us. The problem was that his entire right arm was pretty weak and painful/numb and he insisted on working grill. I have never seen anyone struggle so hard to cut chicken. He could barely cut through, his cut sizes were horrible, and he was painfully slow. The entire time we were running out of food and people would offer to help but he insisted on doing it himself so we just resigned ourselves to a horrible shift. 

6. In relation to your outside hire GM my old FL was also an outside hire and one time when he was at the store he referred to the portion cups as soufflé cups. What a wildly out of touch guy.

Edit: I forgot about this story cause it happened a long time ago but there was an SM at a store in my patch where one of my best friends worked. One night when she was MOD she said she received a phone call at the store saying that a person had taken the GM hostage and to take all the money from the safe and put it all on visa gift cards to send them. She freaked out and was trying to call the GM who was busy (and not being held hostage obviously) and complied and emptied the safe. She ended up getting fired because obviously she just made up the whole thing and stole the money and they found proof of it. Now there are stickers on every safe in the patch saying that they should never empty the safe for any reason."

Chipotle,fd6doda,t3_ek56ed,1578189387.0,Sofritas! It’s tofu but it’s very good and flavorful. You can ask to get a sample of it just a heads up it is a little spicy. Also definitely recommend adding fajitas and corn salsa.

TheNinthHouse,fcwimkp,t3_dsmh8k,1578026620.0,You posted this a long time ago but I just stumbled on it and the way I read it was that palamedes and Camilla weren’t strong enough for them to do it but I don’t think he was saying it was entirely impossible. Since it seemed like Gideon and Harrow had more raw talent than palamedes and camilla it makes sense I think? that they could be strong enough to pass through
NEU,fcwerjd,t1_fcvyhc0,1578023769.0,As far as I can tell either they don’t or they don’t really care. They basically walk around quickly and give things a quick glance. Walked outside to smoke once and came back to find the slip saying we passed room checks. On a table at most two feet from the slip was some rather inconspicuous stuff that they didn’t notice.

Chipotle,fc6vlnn,t3_eghumd,1577490636.0,"Forget every other type of annoying customer. People who try to scam their way into extra food are the most annoying. I don’t care who you are, four ounces is four ounces is four ounces. Pay for double meat like a real man or eat somewhere else."
Chipotle,fbtewvu,t3_eefcdq,1577076559.0,Yes. Tortillas alone have like 300 calories
