Indiemakeupandmore,ffpe08b,t1_ffpc4bk,1580092688.0,I don't know off the top of my head... It's like a bluish fuchsia pink with a pearlescent finish.
AskReddit,ffpdtp0,t1_ffnx4cb,1580092555.0,"There are a lot of stories on Reddit of people having mouths full of cavities before they are 30. It's really sad. My husband brushes like a champ but hated flossing due to a permanent retainer in his mouth. After having a ton of fillings between his teeth from not flossing, he's realized how important it is. Got the bar removed so he could do it easier."
AskReddit,ffpdmdx,t1_ffpawx2,1580092411.0,I have a cousin that just decided to go to a sperm bank and make her own baby. She was in her mid-30's and didn't want to wait. I suppose it would be better dating a single mother than dating someone who wants you to commit to children in the next 3 years on day one.
AskReddit,ffpcc6r,t1_ffpaw1v,1580091500.0,Yet so many of us poo that way with no issue... And I have IBS.
news,ffpalqr,t1_ffp8xkv,1580090288.0,"There is a bigger issue at play with the disenfranchisement of Black Americans. After slavery ended there was still rampant abuse, and even now massive amounts of discrimination keep the poor in a very bad situation. They aren't really equivalent situations."
Professors,ffp9nf0,t1_ffp9g9h,1580089622.0,"I'm not disagreeing with you at all, I was just confused because it sounded like, with your two comments together, that your students were using Adobe on their phones. I was just clarifying why I was confused."
Indiemakeupandmore,ffp7nvv,t1_ffp70ms,1580088279.0,"That's what I had always heard about it. This one is straight up floral to me. It's very pretty and I love floral, so it's a win for me."
Indiemakeupandmore,ffp6ofj,t1_ffp5dpv,1580087588.0,"I absolutely LOVE autumnalis. I have a full size of it. I think it's one of my favorites from the brand (but I have A LOT of favorites from that brand). 

I wore a molten gloss for the first time the other day and was a little disappointed by how fast it wore off."
Indiemakeupandmore,ffp4i3n,t1_ffozkj6,1580086030.0,The sugar is what made that one sound bad to me. I had the burnt sugar cardamom from firebird and love cardamom but hated smelling like sugar.
RadomActsOfGreed2,ffp4812,t1_ffozjsu,1580085830.0,"Or when they lived with their spouse in 6 years. I don't think it's the case with this one, I was just giving an example."
RadomActsOfGreed2,ffox6bp,t1_ffottv6,1580082890.0,It's common when leaving a domestic violence situation.
Indiemakeupandmore,ffoteex,t1_ffot3ix,1580081536.0,That sucks! I'm sure I have a lot of samples that are now gone forever and can't be replaced. Looking at my Shiro eyeshadow samples for sure...
Indiemakeupandmore,ffosvxr,t3_euezkq,1580081311.0,"I didn't wear makeup this weekend but I did use a sample of BPAL's Dragon's Blood. Their description is only, ""Powerful, commanding, blazing with strength.""

That tells me nothing... sigh.

In the bottle it smelled like a urinal cake. On the skin it was very floral. Maybe a mix of jasmine and lilacs? It was very nice and lasted all day on my skin. I would absolutely consider a fs of this one! 10/10"

Indiemakeupandmore,ffojfie,t3_eua7nk,1580078311.0,Camp nightmare is one of my very favorites.
RadomActsOfGreed2,ffnjb7c,t3_euay41,1580066683.0,"That certainly won the ""saddest story that can't be proven to get video games from strangers for free award"". 

Just keep begging Reddit to do it without question or proof to keep her identity safe.

I'm rather curious why he and the mom are both on medical leave right now."
RadomActsOfGreed2,ffnire4,t3_eu7vsn,1580066445.0,">I am actually looking at this one as a positive change in my life going forward, I just need to learn to be self sufficent...

Not everyone laugh at the irony together or it may shake the internet."
Professors,ffnhk5m,t3_etrrt5,1580066077.0,"Well, based off the comments in this thread, I'll just go ahead and say it: I am very, VERY lucky and have rarely experienced anything like what y'all are mentioning. I don't know if it's something unique to me or my student demographic, or if I'm the luckiest bitch on the planet, but yeah. I haven't had many entitled students and certainly not entitled parents.

I'm sorry the rest of you are dealing with that crap."
