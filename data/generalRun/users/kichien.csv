Had she not touched it there would have accrued enough growth & interest to pay for much of their college tuition. Point being, you might want to get help setting up a trust fund for your granddaughter. Maybe with age stipulations.

Transitioning might be the best option for some people (meaning I don't know because I don't know what dysphoria feels like) - but also I think our society needs to make WAY more room for men to express themselves across a wider range of options. Women have been addressing and fighting gender cliches longer than men have and while women still suffer from those cliches we have more options in dress at least. It's why I adore Billy Porter for instance. I'd like to see more men wearing dresses and makeup because they want to, without feeling the need to call themselves women."

Something she claims happened nearly two years ago she leaks the day before the debate? To the ""news"" organization running the debate? Then the way she handles herself after the debate?

No, I don't think it's two people telling ""half truths"".  I think it's very obvious. And honest to gods it makes me sad. She was my close 2nd choice and sometimes my first choice. I defended her A LOT against people who called her a ""phony progressive"" thinking it was mostly trolls trying to divide the progressive wing of the party.

I never understood their anger as I thought it was just her being proud of a family story but over the past couple days I've learned the extent to which she lied about that. She put down her race as 'American Indian' (not 'mixed race' but full on American Indian) on her Texas Bar registration - an official document. And she did it as an adult, not some kind of larky kid thing. Or Harvard Law School referring to her as their first hired ""woman of color"" - they didn't pull that out of their asses, she must have led them to believe that. I'm going to be honest, this really pains me. I've defended her and I've gone back and forth between her and Sanders as my preferred candidate.
