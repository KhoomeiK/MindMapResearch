>Bees have two stomachs, one of which is completely dedicated to storing  the nectar they collect from flowers. When full, this stomach can weigh  as much as the bee itself. These honeybees return to the hive after  visiting upward of 1,500 flowers. Once there, they pass off the nectar  to worker bees by vomiting it up out of their second stomach and into  the worker bees’ waiting mouths.

galaxys10,ffebjy5,t1_ffcnayn,1579842211.0,"Samsung has gone ahead with changing the naming convention of its entire phone lineup.  
We have new mid range phone series :   
Alpha series : A10/20/30/40/50/50s/60/70/80/90

Millennial series : M10/20/30/30s/40

Now Samsung wants to do the same with S series lineup. This helps in multiple ways:

1. Homogeneity across all lineups.
2. Now this is more beneficial for Samsung. This naming allows Samsung the room to release many many more new phones later, which align to the same series name.  


For example, the A series had multiple phone launches in the form of A\*0 across 2019.

* A50/A30/A10 were released in Feb '19.
* A70/A40/A20 in March '19.
* A [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy#Samsung_Galaxy_A_(Alpha)_Series) of other phones until September '19.

Finally, starting 2020, Samsung has started shipping phones with A\*1 series.

* A71/51/01 [launched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy#Samsung_Galaxy_A_(Alpha)_Series) in Dec '19 and are shipping now.

This is not something new, Samsung has done it earlier with its A series. (Remember A7, A8 phones from 2018 ?).

**TL,DR; Get ready for more models in S (Super Smart) series. This is smart indeed from Samsung!**"

Edit : Hi, folks. thank tou for your interest, I don't like to keep you waiting. I'll reply to all questions in a few hours. It's 4am here and I just woke up and saw your message, I'm gonna sleep again now.

See you guys soon. Apologies for the further delay.

Edit 2 : I am back! Let me begin by saying I am surprised, I was expecting to hear names of at least 10 apps that you all were using and considered myself a noob. But, I am happy to share my techniques if that helps you all.

I use a few other cracked premium Android apps, like Nova launcher, Washington post, MX player, Owly for Twitter. So let me know if you need info on that as well.

** Somebody please tell me if this isn't a violation of Reddit rules. I do not want to get banned or removed from Reddit. If that's the case, I'll post this elsewhere and provide a link here.

For now, focusing on Spotify, Youtube and Youtube music. I use Android and have no information about iOS/Windows phones. Let me also make it clear that the premium benefits are not carried to a desktop version of the app, and I do get ads when I'm using Spotify/Youtube on my laptop.

Spotify Premium - The cracked version that I have is 8.5.29.828, and the downside here is that I cannot download a song for offline use. The rest of it works like premium Spotify.
The steps are pretty straight forward, just google ""Spotify cracked premium apk"" or something similar. You will get a list of versions, you can download the one I have or get a more recent update.
Once you have downloaded, open the app and login. I login using Facebook. Make sure that you are connected to a VPN network while login. The VPN must only be of United States, no other country works. If you are already residing in the States, well it might work without a VPN.
Easy peasy, now you just need to login the Spotify app every 15 days using the same USA VPN technique.

Youtube Premium/ Youtube Vanced - This is pretty clear and documented on a lot of websites. Just google this term and you will find the original website where you can download the app, along with instructions. You will need to download a microG app as well to be able to login to Youtube Vanced.
Tip : Disable Chrome browser when you are trying to login to the Vanced app, it didn't work for me otherwise.

Youtube Music Premium - When I found Youtube Vanced, I was curious if something existed for Music as well. It works the same way. Just google ""Youtube Music cracked"" and you'll find a ton of website. You will need a microG for this as well, and also the method to disable Chrome while logging in.

I know I've been brief here, please let me know if you need detailed list of steps or the link to websites.

Cheers"
