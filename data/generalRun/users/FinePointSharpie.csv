baltimore,ffg6tjh,t1_fffc3f3,1579899701.0,"What about a college person that’s worked and volunteered in the city for years and was recently almost carjacked and a Victim of 2nd degree assault, robbery and felony theft? 

Do I get to have a opinion on this “fantastic city” that I work hard for my company to have a presence in? Or because I’m not from here it doesn’t count?

Just because one isn’t “from” Baltimore doesn’t mean people can’t understand and form opinions on real issues. And “better than the middle of nowhere” is subjective. After my experience - I’m lucky to be alive.

Baltimore isn’t a great city. HOWEVER: Baltimore has potential. It’s so low that it can only go up from here. It needs more people that are willing to push for change and actually stick to it."
