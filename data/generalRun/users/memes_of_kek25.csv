Show me where those numbers appear in said thread, seriously; please direct my attention to even a word that indirectly hints at a number like that. You can't - but why? The answer is a simple one, it's due to your undeveloped US education. Personally I think you put those specific numbers in there because ""100"" is the largest integer you can count up to without a calculator, as a mathmatician I'm amused - similar to the feeling one gets when they look at a small animal navigating it's pitiful existence.

Warning: I also noticed that you used an expletive to try hoard upclicks, if there's one thing I've noticed it's that children love when offensive language is used with impunuty. There are hundreds of studies linking swearing to rape, murder, marajuana addiction, and loss of IQ. It's a bad habit - even an illness - in which only a quick administering of downsvotes can fix."
