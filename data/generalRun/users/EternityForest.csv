Improvements on existing tech are usually safer because people expect the same openness they always had. Nobody wants an 0.73mm pencil lead that doesn't work with normal 0.7mm.

Sadly there is no physical discrete diode that has 0v of drop.  When  the forward voltage is in the ""curvy"" range, they act kinda like a nonlinear resistor. 

You get more current with more voltage until you finally get out of that range, and then they have a constant-ish forwards drop(It changes in a mostly logarithmic type of manner with the input current).

Until you get high enough current to destroy the diode, which is another fun analog phenomena!



If an analog circuit is working correctly and doing any kind of precision stuff, it's probably because someone with some real ultra mad skillz designed it.  Everything is wibbly wobbly and there's a real art to getting it right(Which is mostly totally over my head).


You could use an op amp clipper, or you could mess around with some other random odd things like taking a comparator and using that to trigger a tube to pull down the voltage at a certain point, to get some bizzare nonlinear effects and maybe a unique sound.

You might also want a certain amount of rounded clipping (Isn't that part of the ""tube sound""?), so maybe sharp isn't better. Or maybe you want tunable sharpness, or different amounts of clipping in the high and low frequency bands?"

Even the vim navigation commands are mostly only interesting to me because some keyboards don't have arrow keys.  

I haven't seen Vi's superiority proved in a study yet, and I suspect a lot of people who say using the mouse is slow aren't using a good mouse with proper pointer acceleration set up. 

Every DE seems to handle it differently, and I have seen truly awful mouse configurations that fling the cursor across the screen with tiny movements, or they require multiple move and lift and move steps to get anywhere.  Modern mouse acceleration is a pretty complicated algorithms that dynamically changes the speed in a nonlinear way, and like all ""soft"" computer algorithms, it's hard to get right.

Also, Vi may be amazing for writing code, but most programing I do is editing 300 line existing files, so raw input speed doesn't matter.


I use CLI editors for ten line config files. If I have something bigger to do, I mount SSHFS with dolphin, drag the file over, and edit in VS Code.


If you're a sysadmin, plan to use laptops without mice, or you write many small ad-hoc scripts such that you write more code than you edit, Vim is probably a good plan.

It seems a bit tedious to make 20 changes in a 1000 line file using it, but maybe it's just awesome for making one change in a ten line file.


You also might want to learn Vim if you enjoy logical puzzles and tinkering.  Do you like changing the spark plugs in your car?   Have you ever restored a vintage block plane? You might love Vim then.

I hear that both the configuration exactly the way you want it, and the morse-code like mastery of a fairly arcane skill is immensely satisfying for some.   Apparently being able to do complex things by muscle memory alone without thinking about feels really great to some people.

Which, incidentally, seems to be related to the appeal of writing lots of little bash one liners and setting up your environment just the way to want it.  Order from chaos, building things from scratch, etc.

SeattleWA,ffcnmt1,t1_ffchoon,1579803297.0,"I suspect being ""in the prison system"" can make someone feel ""like a criminal"" and become a starting point for more crimes.

Toss the thieves and vandals in the slammer, but don't push the alcoholic sleeping on the streets who's never stolen anything farther into the depths of misery.


There's a lot of effort to eliminate the supply of crime(By enforcing laws), which is good, but we also need to look at the ""demand"" for crime, the situations that lead a person to think that their best option is in fact, a crime.


Gang violence is a bit different though, because that's not just about money and drugs, it's a whole culture, including family-like allegiances and a sense of purpose and belonging that some might not find elsewhere.  

I don't know how to replace that one, without making meaningful careers easier to find, unless the people in question are interested in getting married early and focusing on their partners.


In the power metal fandom I think a lot of people stay out of trouble not by actually being peaceful and nonviolent, but by directing all their hate to the problem itself.

AskElectronics,ffcejeh,t3_esk35r,1579797755.0,"Oooh my favorite thing in electronics! Getting to eliminate a fussy precision mechanical step!

That thing looks old and probably meant to tolerate a certain amount of of force, but I like overengineering things, especially on hobby projects where I *can* and there's nobody to yell at me for it.

That giant heavy knob is a perfect lever. It's dumping all kinds of force on that pot.   Tactile switches aren't the best under constant load from what I've seen, I wouldn't be surprised if pots aren't either.


You could add another bearing to support it, but if that bearing allowed tilt, you'd still have the pot as  a second bearing. Better, but not ideal.

You could fix the pot to something, and then use a plain bearing to support the shaft and constrain it to the acceptable wiggle area.   You would probably be just fine, assuming you got the plain bearing to not scratch up the plastic shaft like an unfinished 3D print might.

(Ready your salt grains, I am not a mechanical engineer and may be speaking imprecisely)

If the bearing was thick, or you used two of them, so that no tilt could happen, you now have an overconstrained shaft. Any arbitrary two points make a line, but three points don't, unless they're just right.

Overconstraint is bad, unless you plan to just accept the need for precision assembly, or you've got plenty of floppy wobble everywhere to compensate.   I'm not a fan of requiring precision, it makes stuff easier to break if it gets dropped, and harder to assemble.


I believe two thrust bearings also counts as a type of overconstraint, they both aft along the same axis, and they both either fight each other, or onyl one does anything, if something isn't right.


So what we want is to exactly constrain things, with no more constraint than needed, aside from whatever redundant constraints we choose to accept (Like ball bearings I believe already use, but those are acceptable because they are mass manufactured and people have long since figured out how to make them well, aka they aren't your problem).


What we really want is for that pot to not move with the knob, but we don't want any force from the knob to get passed on to the pot.


One way would be to use a thick bearing (Maybe just a long hole through some plastic, preventing all movement aside from spinning and axial thrust.  

Now you mount the pot to the shaft, but you don't affix the pot in any way at all.  Now the pot is only subject to it's own weight plus the wires, not the weight of the knob.

Use pegs or something to constrain it's rotation, but don't bother stoping it from moving slightly in any other way.   Just wad up the wires with hot glue, so that it can handle that tiny movement without fatigue at the solder joint.


Now the only way to easily put force on it is to pull it, which, knowing users, is exactly what they will do anyway, making the whole thing seem pointless...


So to make it even MORE bulletproof, don't mount it to the pot, mount it to a threaded rod or something, use some nuts wedged against each other with thread locker(ew) to make a stopper so it can't pull out, then mount the floating pot to that.

Now no matter what they do, all the force is on the bearing where it right well belongs, and you don't have any high precision manufacturing challenges.

This kind of thing is why I love 3D printing!



If you don't have any particular mechanical skill(Like I don't!) it's usually way faster and easier to design things to be easy to build, rather than design them the obvious way and rely on your own talent to line everything up just right.


And yes, this is actually how I approach mechanical things in real life.   I just assume anything that isn't solid state is a little unreliable unless it's off the shelf, with five star reviews, or it's really overbuilt.


In fact, if I was actually doing something like this and wanted a big knob that had to stand up to random people beating on it, I probably wouldn't use a pot at all, I'd consider gluing a magnet on and use hall effect sensors and an Arduino."
