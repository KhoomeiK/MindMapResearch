The experience that you have gone through is in many ways comparable to what happens with domestic violence. Women have always been the primary victims of war. Women lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons in combat. Women often have to flee from the only homes they have ever known. Women are often the refugees from conflict and sometimes, more frequently in today’s warfare, victims. Women are often left with the responsibility, alone, of raising the children. Women are again the victims in crime and domestic violence as well. Throughout our hemisphere we have an epidemic of violence against women, even though there is no longer any organized warfare that puts women in the direct line of combat. But domestic violence is now recognized as being the most pervasive human rights violation in the world. Here in El Salvador, according to the statistics gathered by your government, 1 in 6 women have been sexually assaulted and the number of domestic abuse complaints at just one agency topped 10,000 last year. Between 25 and 50 percent of women throughout Latin America have reportedly been victims of domestic violence."

changemyview,ffhsqw5,t1_fffrghp,1579951990.0,"It is true that most people don't use calculus, but algebra is very basic and a lot of people use it to do their jobs. 

The thing is you couldn't just replace one year of advanced math with sign language and have people learn anything. It takes years to learn a language, preferably beginning while your are relatively young. So you wouldn't just be replacing that year of calculus at the tail end, you'd have to replace much more fundamental math concepts. 

And even if you feel like not everybody needs to take calculus, there has to be an option for people who do want to pursue a field that requires it to continue taking math throughout school. Replacing math with sign language would require that everybody stop taking math for years, which basically puts a brake on anyone who want to pursue a career requiring math.

(I think that there's an argument to be made that if we drop calculus from the standard curriculum it should be replaced by statistics, which is applicable to a wide variety of situations and poorly understood by the vast majority of people)."

neurology,feu9ej5,t1_feu2qn8,1579384414.0,"VEPs and SSEPs are definitely done by neuromuscular/EMG specialists at my institution, so it must vary from place to place (although frankly the procedures themselves are mostly done by techs and just read by the neurologists).

As for DBS, that's a good point but personally I'd put the involvement of movement specialists in a little different category, as although they have a key (and arguably the driving) role in the procedure, they aren't actually the ones performing the procedure with their hands. There are other activities that fall into this category as well, such as epileptologists doing cortical stimulation mapping and assisting with certain epilepsy surgeries. Neurologists can also be involved in a wide variety of surgeries via intraoperative monitoring."
neurology,fetfjd0,t3_eqjjcx,1579374951.0,"Many procedures in neurology involve procedures to varying degrees.

* Neurointerventional: procedures are the point of the field
* Headache: botox and nerve blocks
* Pain: nerve blocks, trigger point injections, etc, although most pain docs are not neurologists
* Movement: botox for things like tremor and dystonia
* Neuromuscular: EMGs and other procedures like visual evoked potentials and somatosensory evoked potentials
* Neurocritical care: LPs as well as standard ICU procedures (lines, etc). This is really the only place you'd use ultrasound much.  

LPs are a procedure many neurologists can do across specialties, however many don't do their own, in part because it does not pay very well. There are a lot of LPs to be done in MS/neuroimmunology in particular if you are so inclined. 

Many do not really do any procedures: stroke (unless you also do neurointerventional), cognitive, behavioral, epilepsy, sleep, neuroopthalmology (although you use cool toys during the exam)."

Not really just the modern era. Since 1935, the award has only gone to a player other than QBR or RB 6 times.
