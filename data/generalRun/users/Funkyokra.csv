Sacramento,ffau6ut,t1_ffan90w,1579744582.0,"NYC has a much lower rate of UNSHELTERED homeless--something like 95% of their homeless are sheltered. Shelter is not a substitute for permanent housing and I could talk all day about the need for CA, and Sac, to vastly increase access to affordable permanent housing. I would gladly turn all of our state's might to making that happen STAT.  However, I am not too optimistic that this will happen in the short term in CA.  In the meantime, we are talking about the pressing issue of an overabundance of unsheltered homeless people in our fairly small city, and all over our state, and the fact that cities have little ability to move them along because the law says you cannot enforce no camping ordinances when there is no available shelter.  NYC does not guarantee a right to permanent housing, just to shelter for homeless people, who still are considered homeless even if they have a place to sleep.  The benefits to CA in doing that is that more people would have access to beds and might choose to move inside, and also that cities would be able to enforce no camping laws in places like the American River Parkway and city parks, unlike now.  The downside is that you are not using those resources for permanent housing, but it seems like people are getting impatient waiting for that to solve the problem."

It is the lack of shelter beds that prevents cities from enforcing the no camping laws.  So, we can either continue as things are and hope things magically go away, we can provide permanent housing for everyone, or we can provide enough shelter space that the no camping laws can be enforced and a larger number of people will go into shelter on their own.

Shelter is not a substitute for permanent housing and I could talk all day about the need for CA, and Sac, to vastly increase access to affordable permanent housing. I would gladly turn all of our state's might to making that happen STAT.  However, I am not too optimistic that this will happen in the short term in CA.  In the meantime, we are talking about the pressing issue of an overabundance of unsheltered homeless people in our fairly small city, and all over our state, and the fact that cities have little ability to move them along because the law says you cannot enforce no camping ordinances when there is no available shelter.  NYC does not guarantee a right to permanent housing, just to shelter for homeless people, who still are considered homeless even if they have a place to sleep.  The benefits to CA in doing that is that more people would have access to beds and might choose to move inside, and also that cities would be able to enforce no camping laws in places like the American River Parkway and city parks, unlike now.  The downside is that you are not using those resources for permanent housing, but it seems like people are getting impatient waiting for that to solve the problem."

I see a lot of people make great improvements, but for many it is hard to maintain a good lifestyle when you are still living in a tent with no end in sight.  I know I'd be drunk right now if I were homeless."
Sacramento,fel2vc6,t1_fel0y14,1579212872.0,"Because I pay attention when Steinberg brings proposals to the council and they don't get passed, or they decide to spend a year and thousands of dollars ""studying"" something (ie, find a way to do it that is free and doesn't inconvenience SOMEONE).  I think they are still studying toilets from about 3 years ago.  Hooray, we got two neighborhood shelters approved, maybe to open about a year after they got passed.  Oh look, one of the shelters is for 180 temporary beds in a location that already permanently houses 90 very low income older and disabled people who are being kicked out with no particular relocation plan.  Because in Sacramento we can't possibly inconvenience people or spend money on NEW shelter space, just recycle the shelter space we already have and wonder why all our problems are not solved."
Sacramento,fel12xu,t1_fekwas5,1579211778.0,"I deal with these people pretty regularly. There is no one single story or solution, but I am seeing a lot of people engaging with various service providers and making changes in their own lives (ie, seeing doctors and taking meds, quitting drugs, looking for work, etc).  However, while service providers can help with many things, there's still that pesky lack of shelter and affordable housing.  One really motivated guy I know just made it into semi-permanent housing after almost two years of being totally on his game while still living in a tent.  And he is super functional, very motivated, with no serious disabilities or mental health problems.  For most people, trying to maintain and live your best life while living in the crawl space under someone's porch stairs is pretty hard--it is easy to lose hope and faith when all your shit gets stolen, and you are freezing, and you get beat up, and everyone around you is bonkers, and some whiskey sure would be good right now."
Sacramento,fekzm2c,t1_feki2iu,1579210907.0,"Plenty have offered strategies, but the bottleneck is that city council has to approve it.  Our mayor has brought them many proposals but most of them are voted down because they cost money, or they aren't the perfect solution for everything right this minute, or they would require a physical location and people object to that.  Once Mayor Steinberg comes up with a solution that is free, convenient for everyone, located on an invisible plane of reality, and guaranteed to perfectly solve the entire issue, then I'm sure they'll be happy to vote for it."
Sacramento,fekz7eu,t1_fekm1yy,1579210662.0,"No, the problem is that we haven't really tried much of anything because everyone is critical of each solution for not being the one size fits all magical silver bullet.  So, Steinberg brings it to the council, people whine that it isn't perfect, and the council votes it down.  Time and time again."
