facepalm,ffhe18x,t1_ffgxvcg,1579931442.0,Yeah some live in shallow waters on the coast. During the season you can just wade out and scoop them up at night with a wire net. It’s actually really fun if you don’t mind getting a bit wet and sandy. The water is usually pretty clear so it’s easy to see where they are

Music,ffgi0hn,t1_fff8qsv,1579906684.0,"Guns may have been a last line of defence back in Hitlers day but times and technology have changed. Now we have things like autonomous drones. If the govt really wants to take over, your little gun ain’t gonna do anything."
Music,ffgh7at,t1_fffh8wi,1579906156.0,"I don’t disagree, and honestly I think the ADF is under budgeted. Using equipment that’s like 30+ years old is risky and there’s only so much upgrades can do before you just can’t keep up anymore. High tech systems cost a lot of money to buy and maintain and that capability isn’t only used for wars as demonstrated recently with the bushfires.

But OP only quotes the figure for the Middle East which is for supporting the wars the US ‘created’. They fail to state that the figure is for a period over 19 years though which makes it seem like we spend a lot more on ‘wars’ than we really do."
Music,ffgfrqo,t1_fffzdlq,1579905238.0,"Yeah, I don’t see what’s down-votable about your comment haha. Nothing wrong with admitting faults and learning something knew"
Music,fff0yec,t1_ffeydvk,1579872657.0,"Australia basically supports the US as an ally in whatever warfighting efforts they do.

The figure that OP stated of $14.7b is over a period of 19 years, and not one year like I initially assumed from the other figures they quoted. Tbh not actually too much if you look at it yearly."

AusFinance,fdirpwm,t1_fdgsohx,1578449552.0,That’s really high for a grad program! Usually they start out at APS 4ish level which is only about mid 60s pay.
AusFinance,fdh2wln,t1_fdh0wkf,1578414218.0,That makes more sense. Sounds similar to one of my friends who is working in a tech company over in Silicon Valley. Good incentive to work hard for bigger gains.

IdiotsInCars,fdd4jpe,t1_fdcvq7t,1578294493.0,"Agreed, which is why I wouldn’t consider the car pulling out to be an idiot. The lane became clear after the accident so they changed lanes."
IdiotsInCars,fdd4dnk,t1_fdctqj3,1578294287.0,From the cars signaling right and the arrow on the road it looks like the right lane is for turning right into another road/building entrance. Usually it’s a slip lane that you have to turn into first from the main lanes so they probably got tired of waiting for the other side to be clear to cross or made a mistake
IdiotsInCars,fdcrp17,t1_fdcmnal,1578282403.0,The car pulling out was probably stopped waiting in the median strip which is what you're meant to do until it's safe to enter traffic. The Camry shouldn't have stopped to let them enter as they have right of way being on the main road.
