More sanctions while trying to Re-negotiate JCPOA? Not going to happen. Trying to Re-negotiate after killing Soleimani? Not going to happen. Iran will wait and see how the election goes before they do anything. Trumps Iran policies are flailing attempts at getting a “win”. 

Iran’s regime would rather say fuck it, and continue to gain influence in regional affairs. They’re happy to ramp up nuclear activities. It’s the only 100% deterrent against regime change. 

Trump has made the situation way more complicated than it needs to be, and is seeking concessions that the other side will never give up."

geopolitics,fdi1p39,t3_elhbnl,1578434167.0,"An interesting point about the Aramco attack:

Iran doesn’t have satellites. No GPS. 

They had to send a UAV ahead of a missile, and feed the data from the UAV into the missile in order to precision strike saudi oil infrastructure. 

They are THE best in the world at unconventional tactics (Soleimani, jerry-rigged stealth submarines, etc). 

We sorely underestimate their capacity to fight a war against us (America)."
