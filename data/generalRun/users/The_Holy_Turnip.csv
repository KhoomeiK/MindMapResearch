RingFitAdventure,ffq96r4,t1_ffq2wii,1580126716.0,"When you go to set fitness skills at the top you should see arms/legs/etc.
At the far right is a selection that brings up another skills menu that arranges exercises according to what you want to work. There's  Core, Waist, Glutes, etc, there's a bunch of them. I've found setting up my exercises using those as a template makes setting up a workout for more particular area easier and helps to speed up switching from focusing on one area of the body to another from day to day easier."

entertainment,fdk2fhp,t1_fdjup5m,1578494402.0,"Court jester was a title that was respected and sought after, they were usually well taken care of and/or paid by the wealthy in titles, land and cash to perform. 
They were also trusted advisors to the king and could get away with saying a lot of things the common folk couldn't say as long as it was tactful. 
Did to the nature of the job they were typically pretty intelligent and had a wide range of skills due to competition and having to constantly finding new ways to entertain the nobles. 
And finally, they were rarely executed.  That's just movie fluff. 

Malkovich would have been an amazing and highly valued court jester."

Food companies started selling you shit that tastes good, that you can easily eat a lot of, that's high calorie and cheap, fights to obfuscate those facts and had pushed blame to the self instead of the company practice.

It's like fighting climate change by taking your bike to work, wearing burlap sandals and living off of celery and homegrown leeks. That's great, good for you, it doesn't solve anything because you're not the problem. The companies are the problem, the blatant lies and kick backs to governments and politicians to keep the cash coming in no matter what are the problem. 

Teach your kids right, that's great, good for you! But if the poison wasn't hiding in the box in the first place this wouldn't be as much of an issue."
