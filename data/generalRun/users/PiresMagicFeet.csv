Wasnt all that impressed honestly. Super light at the start and not really that much flavour. It's very drinkable but not set apart from any of the other millions of juicy ipas that are flooding the market now."
Gunners,ff9enkb,t1_ff9asg1,1579711377.0,Would he make the midfield of any of the other top 4 right now?
Gunners,ff988hb,t1_ff96n8g,1579707118.0,He is an average player who plays consistently average and has an almost guaranteed fuck up in him. He isnt good enough for a team that wants to challenge for trophies.
Gunners,ff96fyr,t1_ff8klt6,1579705955.0,"I wouldn't go so far as to say very good. He has definitely improved, but so has almost everyone
 I just dont think playing at nothing more than average quality consistently is good enough for an arsenal midfielder."

soccer,ff7xbuu,t1_ff73ste,1579660581.0,Cant get rid of him if no one wants to buy him sadly
Gunners,ff7wmk2,t1_ff7r36l,1579660105.0,"I've been anti xhaka since his 2nd season. I dont expect our standards to slip, top 4 is minimum for a club like arsenal."
Gunners,ff7kjs5,t1_ff7c4q2,1579651735.0,"Xhaka is nowhere close to being good enough for the midfield of a team looking to compete in europe and for the league title. He is slow, makes a ton of errors, fouls people for no reason, let's his man run by him all the time, was at fault today for keeping chelsea onside in their second goal, chucked the armband, told the fans to fuck off because they booed him for walking off slowly, and so on. 

He is not at the quality required for a top team like arsenal. In 20 years I dont think weve had central midfielder who has directly led to so many goals against us. He led the league for mistakes leading to goals for 3 years. He doesnt assist and he doesnt score. Every time the ball comes to him he slows the game down drastically. He is always guaranteed to switch off on defense. Right now we dont have a midfield so he fits in. As soon as we can buy someone with half a decent brain and two functioning legs xhaka should be gone. 

When we were trying to sell him only a relegation fighting Hertha Berlin made contact. That should tell you what every other team thinks."
Gunners,ff7k5hd,t1_ff7e023,1579651460.0,I would rather have a defender who didnt gift the opposition a goal every time he steps on the pitch
Gunners,ff7jxou,t1_ff7bcz1,1579651311.0,"He had one average game. He made a mistake for their second goal. He doesnt contribute nearly enough. He is not a midfielder we can start if we want to challenge for the league or win it. That is what arsenals ambition should be, and he is not good enough to match that

If he was, bigger teams would've come calling for him. The only one that did was Hertha Berlin. They're relegation level in the Bundesliga."
Gunners,ff7jqfl,t1_ff7ehyr,1579651174.0,"Dont bother mate this sub goes apeshit for xhaka and mustafi cuz they both cried about how the fans were mean to them. 

I dont know how xhaka is still an arsenal midfielder, hes nowhere near the quality required to challenge for the league let alone win it"
Gunners,ff7jkng,t1_ff7dhbd,1579651065.0,"He was def at fault with the second goal he kept him onside 
But that's this sub for you. Lad has 60 minutes not dropping an absolute clanger and everyone thinks hes a good midfielder again. Theres a reason no good club wants to buy him from us. Hes not good enough"
Gunners,ff7j7nh,t1_ff7hkc2,1579650821.0,"You can be fast as a statue and still a decent player. The issue is he is not a decent player, consistently makes stupid mistakes, is easy to run around, and again HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DIDNT STEP UP ON THEIR CORNER. Mustafi lost his man but xhaka let him stay onside. 

He doesn't contribute that much. He is slow with and without the ball, he is predictable and he doesnt have brains

Add in the fact that he regularly makes mistakes leading to goals, in fact led the league at one point across the seasons hes been here, chucked the captains armband, and acted like it was the fans fault that he is a bad player. Its startling how he has not improved in almost 4 seasons with us. 

The fans had every right to boo a captain who told them to fuck off and walked off the pitch slowly. I cant think of a worse midfielder than xhaka in the last 20 years. I would pick even denilson over him and denilson did my head in at times."
Gunners,ff7dur7,t1_ff7ae0z,1579647269.0,"?? He was the one who played everyone onside for their second goal. 

Xhaka is not an arsenal quality midfielder, and he should be shipped out the second the summer comes"
Gunners,ff79l7j,t3_es067c,1579643933.0,"Xhaka and mustafi at fault for the second goal,  mustafi at fault for the first.  The sooner these two fuck off out of London the better"
Gunners,ff7575n,t1_ff74nez,1579641351.0,"Cygan went invincible with us and was ok at standing in when needed. Senderos made mistakes but he was young with us. He also had some decent matches as well. Sanogo and gervinho never cost us goals, and as frustrating as gervinho was he still had moments. Squillaci played when we had no one else back there and our team wasnt set up to defend ever, he had an interview where he said that what was expected of centre halves at arsenal was far more than most teams. Santos was a left back and also didnt fuck up this much. Silvestre I might give you but I dont remember him being nearly as bad as mustafi. If mustafi starts you give the other team a goal right off kick off. I have watched this team without fail since 1995 and he is the worst player I've ever seen play for arsenal. Xhaka for me comes second"
Gunners,ff74qpz,t1_ff72vuk,1579641093.0,Holding is still working back from injury.  It's not that complicated.  You don't fix an ACL tear and come back after 9 months in top form.  Hate everyone here writing him off.

Gunners,feiz4wj,t1_fehbayh,1579151336.0,"There are 4 main ligaments/cartilage in the knee; acl, mcl, pcl, and meniscus. The acl is side to side movement; it takes up to approx 500 lbs of torque. If you extend too far across the perpendicular when you land/cut, the forces on the knee, as the fulcrum of the leg, increase exorbitantly. If the other muscles dont contract in time to stabilize, the entire force of your upper body, plus whatever momentum and force in another direction due to landing, falls solely on the ACL, causing it to rupture. 

Ideally all the ligaments function together to stabilize, which happens most of the time. The human body is built for long distance running, not necessarily high intensity sprints and rapid changes of direction, though obviously we can train ourselves in that as well."
