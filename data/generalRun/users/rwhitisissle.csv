And here we are with a war to fight. Man, shit's crazy, huh?"" Like, that's such an insane statement to just gloss over politically and it opens up a massive can of worms conceptually for the Star Wars universe. So, the clones have to fight, and they're obviously not getting paid, which makes them slaves. But slavery is illegal in the Republic. Or is it? Also, apparently cloning is not illegal. Most sci-fi stories set in some kind of galactic society have cloning being illegal, largely to prevent issues like massive clone armies from being a thing and to avoid dealing with complex moral issues of person-hood. But here cloning is just a matter of ""oh, you want a massive fucking clone army? Yeah, dog, cash or credit?"" But the craziest thing by far is that the Republic just accepts that a Jedi master bought an army on their behalf. How fucking cheap is that army that nobody in the entire Republic noticed it in the budget? How was there no record of Sifo-Dyas buying the damn thing on the Republic's behalf? Who authorized him to make the deal in the first place? And why is nobody ever suspicious about the existence of this army? Like, isn't that just ludicrously convenient? *Too* convenient, even? The fact that none of these things ever even gets brought up by a character in the entire series is just astounding.

And here we are with a war to fight. Man, shit's crazy, huh?"" Like, that's such an insane statement to just gloss over politically and it opens up a massive can of worms conceptually for the Star Wars universe. So, the clones have to fight, and they're obviously not getting paid, which makes them slaves. But slavery is illegal in the Republic. Or is it? Also, apparently cloning is not illegal. Most sci-fi stories set in some kind of galactic society have cloning being illegal, largely to prevent issues like massive clone armies from being a thing and to avoid dealing with complex moral issues of person-hood. But here cloning is just a matter of ""oh, you want a massive fucking clone army? Yeah, dog, cash or credit?"" But the craziest thing by far is that the Republic just accepts that a Jedi master bought an army on their behalf. How fucking cheap is that army that nobody in the entire Republic noticed it in the budget? How was there no record of Sifo-Dyas buying the damn thing on the Republic's behalf? Who authorized him to make the deal in the first place? And why is nobody ever suspicious about the existence of this army? Like, isn't that just ludicrously convenient? *Too* convenient, even? The fact that none of these things ever even gets brought up by a character in the entire series is just astounding.
