todayilearned,ff4y04l,t1_ff4cgx8,1579575163.0,"Great story about the origins of the icing rule (Wikipedia):

The National Hockey League (NHL) introduced the icing rule in September 1937 to eliminate a common delaying tactic used by teams to protect a winning margin. A November 18, 1931 game between the New York Americans and Boston Bruins is cited as one extreme example that led to the ban on the practice. The Americans, protecting a 3–2 lead over the Bruins at Boston Garden, iced the puck over 50 times. The crowd became incensed and threw debris onto the ice, causing a delay while the teams were sent to their dressing rooms. When the teams met again that December 3 in New York, the Bruins iced the puck 87 times in a scoreless draw."

Players play a faster, European-style skill game today (more similar to Gretzky and the Oilers game back then), whereas in the 80s there will still a lot of fighters on skates on a lot of teams.

Players had much more of a tendency to drink and smoke during the season, and physical fitness wasn't as big.  That's why it is still called ""training camp"" - you came to camp to get physically fit for the season.  Today's athletes are training nearly year-round and are in peak physical condition."

Winnipeg,ff3q147,t1_ff35tvl,1579546382.0,"There are three levels of Court in Manitoba - Provincial Court, Court of Queen's Bench, Court of Appeal.

In most all criminal matters, the Crown has to make an election as to how they are proceeding - summarily (less serious/lower potential sentences) or by indictment (more serious/longer potential sentences).  Some offences are strictly summary, or strictly indictable (e.g. murder).

All summary conviction matters are dealt with solely in Provincial Court, and will never appear in the Court of Queen's Bench.

In Indictable matters, the accused has a choice.  They can either go straight to trial in Provincial Court, or if the accused wishes to have a preliminary inquiry, then you would have a preliminary inquiry in Provincial Court, and then a trial in the Court of Queen's Bench in front of a Judge Alone, or with a Judge and Jury.

The most recent legislation from Parliament has significantly curtailed the availability of Preliminary Inquiries, so there may be a significant reduction in the number of prelims in the future (and a concomitant risk of wrongful convictions).

Summary conviction appeals are heard in the Court of Queen's Bench.  Appeals of indictable matters are heard in the Court of Appeal."

The National Hockey League (NHL) introduced the icing rule in September 1937 to eliminate a common delaying tactic used by teams to protect a winning margin. A November 18, 1931 game between the New York Americans and Boston Bruins is cited as one extreme example that led to the ban on the practice. The Americans, protecting a 3â€“2 lead over the Bruins at Boston Garden, iced the puck over 50 times. The crowd became incensed and threw debris onto the ice, causing a delay while the teams were sent to their dressing rooms. When the teams met again that December 3 in New York, the Bruins iced the puck 87 times in a scoreless draw."

Players play a faster, European-style skill game today (more similar to Gretzky and the Oilers game back then), whereas in the 80s there will still a lot of fighters on skates on a lot of teams.

Players had much more of a tendency to drink and smoke during the season, and physical fitness wasn't as big.  That's why it is still called ""training camp"" - you came to camp to get physically fit for the season.  Today's athletes are training nearly year-round and are in peak physical condition."

Winnipeg,ff3q147,t1_ff35tvl,1579546382.0,"There are three levels of Court in Manitoba - Provincial Court, Court of Queen's Bench, Court of Appeal.

In most all criminal matters, the Crown has to make an election as to how they are proceeding - summarily (less serious/lower potential sentences) or by indictment (more serious/longer potential sentences).  Some offences are strictly summary, or strictly indictable (e.g. murder).

All summary conviction matters are dealt with solely in Provincial Court, and will never appear in the Court of Queen's Bench.

In Indictable matters, the accused has a choice.  They can either go straight to trial in Provincial Court, or if the accused wishes to have a preliminary inquiry, then you would have a preliminary inquiry in Provincial Court, and then a trial in the Court of Queen's Bench in front of a Judge Alone, or with a Judge and Jury.

The most recent legislation from Parliament has significantly curtailed the availability of Preliminary Inquiries, so there may be a significant reduction in the number of prelims in the future (and a concomitant risk of wrongful convictions).

Summary conviction appeals are heard in the Court of Queen's Bench.  Appeals of indictable matters are heard in the Court of Appeal."
