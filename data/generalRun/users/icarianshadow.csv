ProRevenge,fe3vvjb,t3_elu0q5,1578853338.0,"I am so glad everything worked out for you, OP! You inspired me to do the same thing at my own job. 

In October, my work offered me a transfer to another state because my current job wasn't going to be funded for next year. I wanted to go immediately and get away from my terrible boss, but I already had surgery scheduled in November, so they pushed my move/transfer to January. 

The surgeon lied to my face and said I'd only need a week off, and then after the surgery, it magically turned into ""at least two weeks."" So, I took two weeks off. At the two week postop, it became ""well we usually ask you take at least six weeks off..."" 

I felt about 85% at the time, so I probably could have pushed through and gone back to work. But I thought about your post, and about my boss, and I said fuck it and took all six weeks, which turned into 7-1/2 because it ran into our Christmas/New Year's shutdown. I got the rest of the year off, I had plenty of time to pack, and I got a nice relaxing staycation away from my terrible boss in preparation for the next chapter of my career. 

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for convincing me that I needed to take time for my own health!"

> 2. People who work to become thin did not earn their thin privilege. 

To normal people, privilege (I'll write it with a lower case p) is any benefit bestowed on you by other people. It can be either earned or unearned. In a social justice context, Privilege (upper case P) is specifically any *unearned* benefit bestowed on you by other people.

FAs navigate those two statements by selectively alternating between the two definitions and hoping you don't notice.

So let's look at the idea of thin privilege. Thin people very obviously have advantages in life. They're healthier and have an easier time navigating the world. Strangers view them as more attractive and desirable. FAs constantly talk about thin privilege as benefits bestowed on thin people by society. (This includes the health benefits, since FAs believe that ""health"" is a social construct, and that if only the bigoted medical establishment would adopt their size-inclusive model of health, then they would be considered healthy, too.)

When you point out that you earned all those benefits by working hard to lose weight, FAs turn around and say ""oh no no! You can't *earn* Privilege!""

And then they will explain how you didn't *really* earn that thin privilege by working hard to lose the weight. It had nothing to do with your own actions, discipline, or hard work. Instead, it was purely a product of your circumstances. 

For example, you had access to a gym/safe exercise space. You could afford to buy healthy food in a supermarket because you don't live in a food desert. You have thin genes / a fast metabolism. You could afford to buy a food scale and were educated enough to use simple arithmetic to add up your calories. You were educated enough to read this subreddit, and had enough critical thinking skills that you could apply the principles of CICO to your own life and change your habits.

I could go on, but I think you get the point.

**The convenient thing about the concept of unearned Privilege is that someone can take basically any privilege, and they can make up a bunch of scenarios to justify why this privilege wasn't really ""earned"" after all.**

Once they've argued that you didn't actually *earn* a particular benefit, then they can justify things like skinny shaming and other harrassment as ""punching up"" at you."
insaneparents,fbgja2u,t1_fbf9g92,1576851033.0,"There are two different things at play here: whether your opinion matters in court during the custody decision, and whether that decision is actually enforceable on you IRL, depending on your age.

Many states will take the teen's preference into account during custody hearings, depending on age. This is not relevant to your current situation, since it sounds like you already have a custody agreement in place.

At 17 *you cannot in practice actually be compelled to go.* Like some other posters have said, the parent you are currently living with simply has to give you the *opportunity* to go. You have every right to refuse to go. Literally, tell the other parent/family that you don't want to come visit. Explain that they can call the cops, but they'll laugh in their faces.

If the cops do show up, remain calm, and simply say you don't want to go visit your other parent."
