therewasanattempt,ffgs4us,t1_ffgqtc7,1579913662.0,"Except that exactly why I qualified it as a guess. Regardless just because there's a finite number of firefighting jobs doesn't mean all of those jobs are filled. My point is that I don't know. You are speaking with certainty that there's no open positions. 

Furthermore, let's presume you're correct and say all firefighting jobs are full today. There will still be people quitting, retiring and dying who will need to be replaced. Those positions could be filled in a more diverse way. So even in your scenario it's not impossible it increase diversity without taking jobs from white people. Nobody is suggesting firing white fire firefighters to hire POC.

Edit: also you specifically said white people would lose their jobs, not just that the numbers would be affect. Obviously there will be less white people. But that's not the same as saying people would lose their jobs."

terriblefacebookmemes,ff8hz36,t1_ff8ggi1,1579679334.0,"There's breast surgery specifically to alter the shape, not just size. I think the real issue is that there are lots of surgeons out there that do it for cheap (relative) and not all of them are the best. I just think there's probably surgeons that do it well but also plenty of surgeons that don't. Most people probably can't afford the ones who do it well so we end up with lots of people out there who get not so great breast surgeries. Coupled with the fact that it's all subjective. Some people just like the absurd over the top ballon looking boob jobs."
SandersForPresident,ff8h6ab,t1_ff7rxg1,1579678305.0,"I'm no constitutional lawyer, but since the supreme Court ruled that money is speech, how could a law be passed that limits donations without limiting speech as defined by the supreme Court? Any law passed that would contradict the citizens United ruled would immediately be challenged in Federal courts and would likely be struck down using citizens United as precedent. So unless you amend the Constitution, or have citizens United ruling overturned I don't see how that would work."

I'd say generally when people are talking about torque vs horsepower what they really mean is peak torque vs peak horsepower, not necessarily torque vs horsepower at a given RPM."

vegan,fdasku7,t1_fdaqojd,1578249561.0,Because when people accuse somebody of being a psychopath for killing a cat or dog it's because they've done it for no reason other than to kill them.

fakehistoryporn,fd0qtr2,t3_ejqpnc,1578122519.0,"To everyone talking about trigger discipline, contrary to what many think the 4 rules of gun safety have exceptions.

Always treat guns as though they are loaded - Glocks can't be disassembled without pulling the trigger. 

Keep your finger off the trigger until ready to fire - in addition to the example above, dry fire practice is widely accepted to be safe and a valid way of training.

Never point a gun at anything you aren't willing to destroy - guess this one doesn't have much exception unless you include inanimate objects.

Be sure of your target and what is behind it - this one probably has no exceptions

These rules are meant so that breaking any one of them isn't going to result in disaster. Treating all guns as though they are loaded in reality means treat them as though they are loaded until personally verifying it is not loading. Picking up a gun, verifying the magazine and chamber are empty, then pulling the trigger isn't bad safety."
