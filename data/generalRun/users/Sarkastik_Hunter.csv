Semenretention,fg8dxtp,t1_fg8axrt,1580616675.0,"See, that's how much hold and masturbation has on them that they can't even quit it long term. That's addiction right there.

You are right, it's natural to masturbate, but we don't really do that here because it doesn't really have any benefits, other than ""clearing the pipes"", which has been debunked already.

I have read your posts and it just seems like you're just rambling about doing sr and not doing anything worthwhile with it. 


Wtf would sr do if you're just in ur bed all day and have no actual goals that you wanna achieve. Surely, you must have some goals, that's why you are on this journey isn't it?


Have you created any good habits?


Have you transmuted your sexual energy into something good?


Do you read any books or socialise?


Do you want to have a partner?


SR won't give you anything but it's the first step in achieving everything you want, but it's not the only step, you have to still work for yourself but SR would make it easy for you. Atleast, that's what I understand from these wonderful posts here.


If you're on SR and don't make any good habits or learn some stuff, do you think it's going to make you a genius or something. That's what I thought.


Solution: Learn new stuff, Make new habits, Work on your goals/passion. If you don't have a passion, try to find it.


Ps please use , and . in your post from next time. Thanks and Good luck bro."
