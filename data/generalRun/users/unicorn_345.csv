unpopularopinion,ffp8lq5,t3_eugirg,1580088924.0,"I’m not sure it was initially advocated as time saving. When I went to drivers ed I think it was more about safety. The driver backing in is more obvious than the driver backing out. More likely to back in safely with mirrors as less movement around, as most cars are stationary around them and lines don’t move. Backing out issues are mirrors aren’t 180° as there’s always a blind spot. Ppl walking in parking lots aren’t always paying attn, other drivers aren’t always paying attn or don’t see the person backing out with all the activity."
insaneparents,ffp74bh,t3_eue8vi,1580087900.0,Insane. Much of the writing in black was ok. Not totally on board but relatively reasonable. “Cooperative” is what kinda had me think twice because kids have moments like adults. Then I read the rest. WTH. Being emotional is normal. Being grumpy is normal. Kids aren’t robots programmed with “sugar and spice and everything nice.” Some Stepford Wives insanity.
AskReddit,ffozyob,t3_eueera,1580083804.0,"My family lives out in the country, so far out in the country that if it snows hard enough they might go for a couple weeks without trash service and you have to have 4WD sometimes in the winter. Literally they aren’t leaving the yard or driveway without it. 

My mom falls, was standing on a step stool of some sort I think. They call the ambulance, they call me to meet them and grab my little sister from them at the hospital. Hang up right away as they’re waiting on the ambulance and mom needs basic care. I happen to be near the hospital at some shop so I just stay in the area. Half hour later I haven’t been called back, no news at all from any of them, and begin to worry as they should’ve been on the road by now. Call them. No ambulance yet. They’ll call when they leave. Ok. Wait around some more and finally around an hr after the first call they’re on the way. 

Ambulance got lost. Ppl not from the area, that’s fine it happens, give them directions, but they were still lost. Don’t know what happened there. So use gps. Come to find out, google maps and gps put their house down the other direction of the road and the ambulance went too far. When they plug the address into gps after getting lost it puts them on the right dirt road and it’s technically correct. If they could have followed that road it would drive right past the house. But it’s so far off the beaten path that parts of the road are little more than a dirt trail through brush and grass. Weird technicality of it still being in gps and on maps but it’s not considered a passable road and even as a trail in good condition can require 4WD. My dad had to redirect them once they got back on a main road and give turn by turn directions ahead of time because there’s several dead zones for many cell phone companies. 

Turns out mom broke some foot or ankle bones and required surgery. Met parents at the hospital, fed my sister and went home. A few days later I got on google maps and provided a correction for my parents address. 

A couple years later I heard about an accident a few miles from my parents place heading into town. There’s a bad turn on the way that isn’t smooth and it’s gravel. Lots of vehicles slide when going even a few miles too fast if it’s slick or if the gravel was put down recently. Well that’s what happened, a bit too fast and new gravel. Over the radio I hear the dispatcher describe the location after providing the crossroads, and detail that the reporting party said it was below the blue water tower. Ambulance radio responded that they don’t know where that tower is. Idk how long that response took, but knowing the area can make a huge difference as it seems to still be in the Stone Age sometimes."

Vent,ffo1rae,t3_eub585,1580073274.0,That is definitely odd that he didn’t tell you about knowing your cousin. That’s more than enough for some ppl to end things. Deception sucks and leaves you on edge and questioning things that person says and does. Trust is a hard one to move on from.

When I went looking for another dog the shelter informed me this one was other dog aggressive, and while he might have gotten along with my dog he might not get along with others. This mattered then and would matter now as my dog travels with me and sees other family and other animals. Siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles have met my dog in their own homes and had the shelter not been honest I’d have struggled some because I like to travel when I can and the dog goes with me."

When I’m gone he just chills in the bedroom. Outside though he tears around and gets the zoomies. I’ve only seen him get the zoomies inside once or twice.

rant,ffjxaps,t3_etur8z,1580009499.0,"Totally get that. Not a kid anymore but it’s still sometimes just can’t. Country living can be inconvenient at times and outright risky at others. Simple things like not always having trash service if it snows, or being able to leave if the weathers bad. Once couldn’t get an ambulance because gps didn’t direct ambulance correctly or they didn’t know how to get here. Any trip to the big town is an ordeal. The small local town has bare minimum groceries sometimes. Internet sucks and so does phone reception. Idk if it all relates, but I’ve lived in the city and the country and most ppl really don’t get how country living is."

unpopularopinion,ff835xg,t3_erz9j8,1579664754.0,"I’ve deleted comments. It’s not really the challenge as you say. It’s not fear or being afraid. It’s annoying ppl demanding attn and expecting me to give it to them. Delete and problem solved for me. I often answer with a mixture of experience and knowledge. I’m not random internet ppls encyclopedia, dictionary, or google and if they’re going to demand that and keep downvoting then the comment gets buried anyways and is of little to no use to anyone I might have helped. 

Often get one person spewing some crap, for example on a pet page. Person asked for food suggestions for an ill pet, everyone caveated with “talk to your vet” including me. I responded with my suggestion and had several ppl attack my suggestion and then demand I define the words I was using. Google can do that for them. My research on this food was almost a decade old as my pets hadn’t been sick much since then. And if they aren’t interested in feeding their pets a specific diet why are they harassing me? 

I have crap internet reception, crap data reception, and come on reddit as it demands less of both and to enjoy some convos and sometimes help if I can. Getting my inbox essentially spammed by their responses to my comment isn’t fun. So I’ll delete stuff, respond directly to the original post if I see a point in it, and move on without losing brain cells because other ppl want me to provide links to dictionaries and google. Mind you, I’ve only deleted a handful of comments if that. I’ve deleted a post or two that were no longer relevant in my life, as I didn’t want the reminder of a time I was upset."

AskReddit,ff69lq3,t3_erw223,1579622341.0,"Let someone couch surf because they needed helped. We both had dogs and hers kept pissing on the floor. She kept blaming my dog. So I locked my dog in the bedroom and her dog pissed on the floor around dinner one night. I happened to walk in the kitchen and see it. Let her know her dog pissed and it couldn’t have been my dog. She didn’t get up to clean it or anything in a half hr span. I ended up grabbing my dog and being gone for an hr. She was living rent free because she needed to save to get a place. I didn’t mind cleaning up the kitchen if she cooked. But she cleaned nothing until that dog peed and my dog was locked up. She nitpicked about money spent at Costco when she lived rent free. I had enough and said she had to leave at the end of the semester. She flipped because we had agreed to her staying two weeks into break. Well my plans had changed, I was leaving early for home, and I wasn’t leaving her to destroy my space. This doesn’t seem extreme and it isn’t all of it but her dog peed everywhere in the common space and she tried to blame my dog every time. It was linoleum so it mopped right up but it reeked the first week she left. I think I mopped twice a day for that week to get rid of the smell and it was winter so opening the windows made it cold. Add to it she expected me to tend to her dog but refused to walk mine and at one point I was injured and still walking two dogs. I hate roommates."
unpopularopinion,ff67y8v,t3_erw1fj,1579621269.0,"Before you say anything, I read the article. It often comes down to cost. It costs money, time, and experienced ppl. A lot of times that can’t happen. Prescribed burning happens all the time. But even if you had money, time, and experienced ppl it would take decades to catch up to some areas as many places have been short of money, time, and experienced ppl for years. The way I heard it put once is the forest is going to burn either way. The difference may be whether or not it’s human started and controlled. I don’t disagree. But some swaths of land are so vast that you can really only hit so many areas in the time allotted for prescription burning. There’s science and numbers behind it all and weather being relatively unpredictable can change everything in a day."

I know it’s not a perfect solution but maybe a “in the meantime” thing until you can talk to your dr. As far as the skin goes, I’ve used cool aloe gel. It helped the heat.

IllegalLifeProTips,ff3483c,t3_ercg5o,1579533265.0,"Dumpster dive? Some places it’s illegal so check that first. And definitely make sure stuff isn’t rotten, just “expired”. Maybe some places, like smaller mom and pop type grocers or more friendly places, see if you can talk to a manager. Maybe they’ll let you set up a temporary charge acct for bare minimum necessities. Or maybe they’ll give you “expired” stuff or past the sell by date. I know a small town store that my mom used to leave money for us kids to get food. We ran out once and were still getting food, they just turned it into a charge acct system instead of a prepaid and kept it all on the books. Small town stores can do this sometimes. 

Local charities might be able to help. Sometimes they have emergency funds set aside. I’ve seen ppl ask for help on site like Craigslist before. If there’s a local town to you it could help some or maybe someone there knows a local place that would help. Maybe even a freecycle.org in your area. Some metropolitan and large cities have them. 

Illegal stuff, steal and pawn. Don’t grab stuff with serial numbers or that is unique. But pawn shops now keep video. Steal and sell over Craigslist. Those get checked by ppl and cops too though so nothing identifiable or unique. And sometimes can’t get rid of stuff quick because it’s being looked for. 

Maybe could panhandle. Heck, set up a cashapp or something of the like and write the cashapp on your cardboard. Tell them something like “hungry family, every penny helps $cashapp” maybe some will bring out canned food. Maybe some will give your cashapp some small funds."

AskReddit,ff1x41n,t3_er61fh,1579488174.0,"Early on its often a gut feeling. At least if they know what they’re doing to some extent it usually just a gut feeling. You could date someone for years, get married, and never be abused and then the abuse could begin. One thing that does happen with some ppl though is love bombing. It feels like it’s going to fast and it’s a whirlwind romance or relationship of sorts. Watch how the person treats other ppl or talks about other ppl. If all their exes were crazy or somehow nothing was their fault ever in their life then you might have issues later on. None of this is set in stone though. Some ppl get married right off and never have a problem. Some ppl just had a crap upbringing or may be going through a rough patch. So back to that gut feeling."

AskReddit,fegjc8k,t3_ep1sf8,1579094538.0,"It’s had good and bad. Don’t mind getting carded at all but had one server think my ID was bogus. That was annoying more because it was just one of those nights. One boss couldn’t understand why I wore slacks and a button up shirt and thought I was “overdressed” for the community and field. I saw it as a way to age myself a bit as I looked like a kid to some ppl still, which could be detrimental."
AskReddit,fegiqti,t3_ep1tmp,1579094027.0,"Getting gas. I don’t mind maintenance, especially when I do it myself. I actually kind of enjoy working on my car some. I hate getting gas all the time. Live 30-40 minutes from just about anything I regularly do besides work so I’m always weighing the pros and cons of a drive because gas costs even when it’s relatively cheap."
AskReddit,fegicuu,t3_ep1txv,1579093692.0,Learning the language and when I first began I was told I’d likely be made fun of a bit because if obviously have an accent and not speak it perfectly. Is this really a thing? To mock ppl learning French.

unpopularopinion,fecs39s,t1_feavdmf,1578982482.0,"Diamonds are actually not as valuable as marketed, it’s a rigged market. The powers that be in that industry choose to restrict the sale of diamonds to keep the “value” up. In fact several other stones can be more valuable than a diamond even in the current market but the image of a diamonds value has created a false inflation of it."
wholesomememes,fecnszx,t1_fecnmxr,1578978588.0,I have a thing for noise when I sleep. Some tv shows and movies are easy to sleep to. Others are a big fat no. Maybe I’ll try Bob Ross for sleep. Obviously worked for the adhd one. Might work for me.
unpopularopinion,feazc1a,t3_eob47t,1578953820.0,They made a whole Rx internal capsule for this because for some ppl it is so severe and no amount or type of external care will cure it. Accutane is no longer prescribed as Accutane but in generic form now.

AskReddit,fe8vc9x,t3_eo5kcg,1578931414.0,"Mad I took my lunch instead of eating on the road, from the same person who had told me a week or two prior that I had to take my lunches. Also lectured about leaving the building for lunch when they weren’t paying me to stay. I’ve seen plenty of other bs but that one was  cheap as far as expecting productivity."
TrueOffMyChest,fe8v4ry,t3_eo5khn,1578931294.0,"Yeah, that happens. It sucks though. When I resigned I set a date only a week out as I’d heard that if they let you stick around that long you were treated in a hostile manner. This meant I had a week to wrap up some things and no time for the drama that could have occurred."

Both hairdressers were working with the same haircut, as I’d seen the one for awhile before switching to the new one. Now that I’m growing my hair out again, having the new hairdresser is nice. I can trust her trims to grow out as expected."

I meant to get some but found another decent brand, and tried a few different ways of making it. The moka pot and some South Indian style make espresso style coffee. Go with blondes as well. Like the flavor better. I read heard lighter the coffee the more caffeine."
AskReddit,fe7xqnv,t3_eo3gya,1578920330.0,Craft stores and home improvement stores now sell temporary wall paper and even temporary backsplash. It’s just an appearance thing but can add some personal touch. A nice rug can help if the carpet isn’t plush. Also will help protect the carpet from spills if they’re placed hear high traffic areas. Decent curtains can be nice.
