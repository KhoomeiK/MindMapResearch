If your university has student evaluations, then they already knew how awful she was, they just didn't have something they could use to get rid of her.

There was a miserable prof in a department I was teaching in.  She resented students and was the most boring teacher possible.  So the students tried to like her, but because of her unending resentment toward them, they universally ended up hating her, making for bad student evaluations.

Well the department decided to fire her - best move for the students.  But they couldn't.  They'd been giving her 3 classes a semester, which by their own rules meant she forever had the choice of whether to continue teaching.  This caused miserable teacher to lose a lot of friends in the department, but she stuck to her guns and refused to leave.  I'm sure that the dean is just wishing she'd do something crazy so firing her became possible."

Ok, so capitalism is a natural process?

That's more extreme than the claim I make above, where I specifically write "" Nature essentially works like capitalism, with the top hierarchy of any species pushing out the bottom hierarchy. If anything, capitalism mirrors nature so close that it uncomfortably shows us how base humans can be.""

&#x200B;

In other words, you just agreed with my initial claim. Thanks.

I'll also point out that your ""  Instead of history as something that happens to us, it is something we can consciously control and shape. The point I am making is that late stage capitalism or neo-liberalism is consciously and deliberately the way it is. It is not because of some ""natural"" historical process."" is 100% true, but a totally moot point for this discussion, literally adding nothing of relevance here.

What did you think powerful people were going to do? Party all the time? Of course they're going to create systems that maintain and grow their power!  Just like alpha males+females of other species - they work hard to maintain their power. So all you're doing is further backing up my initial argument, that capitalism mirrors nature, and you're explaining the process by which the elite maintain their positions.  I totally agree!

That's why I wrote that we have to be aware of our natures and build systems that correct for them. i.e., socialism.  I don't know, I guess me arguing for carefully constructed socialism that restricts individual greed specifically because capitalism shows us what happens when we don't somehow makes me not a socialist to you.

Whatever. I'm going to block you after posting this so I don't have to read your  self-interested, angry babbling of setting straw men to knock down that have absolutely 100% nothing to do with any of my points.

\^is what I wrote in my first comment. No where do I write ""therefore we should be capitalist.""

I'm pointing out that what may be a normal, expected outcome of natural systems is nevertheless unethical, that humans must rise above our base nature and create systems that are better for all.

Your point ""there is nothing natural about capitalism"" reflects your disgust with capitalism. While I'm glad you're also disgusted by capitalism, I find your claim that it's not the outcome of natural processes to be dangerous.

It's dangerous because it fails to recognize that individuals will tend to act in their selfish interests. As you wrote before about foragers, they created cultural systems that decrease the selfishness of individuals. Yet they did so out of necessity: each forager, as an individual, is better off acting for the group under those circumstances

This problem is exactly what we have to solve now, but in the modern world. We have to get people acting for the group, but doing so by recognizing that individuals will act selfishly."

socialism,ff7wkdg,t1_ff7tijc,1579660065.0,"If you're saying that social hierarchies are natural and punish those at the bottom, and that capitalism grossly exaggerates this, then we agree.  But that's only because of how capable humans are at controlling resources. Like so many of our traits, this one is magnified compared to other animals.

Among foragers, there are several reasons why they are egalitarian: 1. it's impossible to monopolize resources when everything you make and use comes from the land around you. 2. the groups are small, everyone knows everyone. 3. the tech is low, so individuals survive because the group survives, which means you're relying on everyone.  It's a bad idea to make enemies.

So you're partly right with this sentence ""it appears necessary to survival of our species when resources are tight.""  It's necessary for the survival of the individual, so people do it. But you have to know people still try to hoard, lie, and do normal human things in these cultures. Where family or individual housing exists, hunters will sneak their kills in.  And there are cultures where it's taboo for hunters to eat their own kills, thereby overcoming these problems too.

And higher ranking animals will take food directly out of their mouths if they want, and they suffer much less repercussions for beating them.

In other species, like canines, it's quite similar in terms of who gets to mate, who is policed, and who gets food when food is scarce. In fact, trying to think of a species that doesn't work in social hierarchies with the bottom suffering is difficult.

And this is why we should avoid capitalism: evolution, natural selection and the hierarchies it produces are not something to base morality on."

fictionalscience,ff5l2ga,t3_erp5u3,1579598067.0,"Your consciousness is produced by your brain, by your neurons creating connections between them - neural networks.  For ex., when you see something, say a spider, the light first hits your photoreceptors, which fire in a whole bunch of interesting ways, denoting the colors, shapes, shading and movement of the spider.  This information is then relayed to your occipital lobe, and then undergoes a lot more processing. As that resolves itself, connections are made to your language, emotional, memory and finally your cognitive sections.

So you see the spider, can describe it in your language, experience whatever emotion you have with spiders (fear, fascination, indifference) depending also on what it's doing (spider stuff or rushing toward you scarily), and cognitively think about it vis a vis your personal life history and cultural context.

In other words, experiencing something requires a bunch of separate neural structures in your brain all coordinating and talking together. You literally are your brain and you only function because of neural networks processing sensory and cognitive phenomena and informing other neural structures of these.

If you did as you wrote, slowly mapping and copying this all out, you'd create a copy that thought it was you - at least at the moment of divergence.  Then it would exist on its own, as a cognitive system based on how your specific brain works.  Assuming your model is 100% accurate of course.

Anyways, as it lived apart from you, it would grow differently than you. If it's not in a body, it's not living through human experiences.  If it were somehow in a body and you, the original died, it would probably think it was you.  But you would have died with your brain.  Because you are your brain.  You don't float separately from it, it's not just taking care of you, it literally makes you up.  That's why when people get brain damage, their personality can change, their experience of the outside world can dramatically change.

Re: how to create an exact copy of your hundreds of billions of neurons. Uh...using magic!  No idea, map each neuron out I guess and track them using tech we don't have.  There are several ongoing research projects involving doing just that - mapping out the neurons of various animal brains.  Last I heard they had some success with a nematode worm."

facepalm,ff2ia2y,t1_ff2gngb,1579507334.0,"You know what? I could be totally wrong.  But here are the reasons I don't believe that skin color matters to running fast:

\- running fast isn't genetically determined by 1 gene, but must involve genes for muscle size and strength, tendon strength, ligament strength, bone strength, height, lung capacity, heart capacity, and whatever mental attributes are needed to become a top athlete

\- it's unlikely one group of people would have a multigene complex that granted them faster running speed while other populations lacked it. Single gene mutations that offer advantages for specific environments exist in human populations, but I've never heard of one so complex as to govern something like running speed

\- genes express themselves in development through and because of the environment. In this case, that means lots and lots of running, good food and nutrition

\- genes are modified by environmental factors that affect epigenetics for up to 5 generations (this is why Americans are so tall: parents have unlimited food, their epigenetics recognizes this, modifies the genetic expression of their children, children grow taller than parents - for up to 5 generations). In other words, if there are epigenetic factors that govern running speed, the population of people where the best runners are is likely expressing them. This will give that population an advantage in running for up to 5 generations even if people from other populations have 1) exactly the same genetics and 2) same environment because they would still be ""catching up"" (as it takes 5 generations to exhaust genetic flexibility)

\- skin color genes aren't attached to other genes or gene complexes, and something like 6 genes code for skin color variation. So that's not a lot. In other words, if Kenyans were genetically ""better"" at running fast, it wouldn't have anything to do with their skin color but some other multi-gene complex, and this gene complex could be passed down to their offspring, regardless of the skin color of their parent

\- I suspect that the conditions top black athletes are raised in is what makes them top athletes more than their genes.  Yes, top athletes have good genes, but so do a lot of people.  What separates them is probably their development and dedication to whatever sport they perform
