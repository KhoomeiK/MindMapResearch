Parenting,fe8hnqy,t3_enz70j,1578926250.0,"Sorry if you already answered this, but I didn't see it scanning the comments... How did you know he needed to go to the ER? What were his symptoms?"
boston,fdrjez4,t3_emvdlt,1578685324.0,"Most of the spots I knew are dead and gone. The Pit in Harvard (area around where the T stop comes up), the Rat. I'm curious if anyone will pipe up with current places."
todayilearned,fdrbix5,t1_fdr2qmx,1578682067.0,Maybe that's not the right word. Tough? Impressive? You can be both tough and dumb. Alls I know is I definitely was not able to carry on as normal after either my motorcycle crash or surgery.
todayilearned,fdr07ub,t1_fdqs1o8,1578677799.0,"I've been in too much pain to eat or pay attention to a movie before. I mostly just lay there with my eyes closed. And that was with painkillers stronger than Tylenol, which I'm assuming she didn't have."
todayilearned,fdqp61p,t1_fdql3mx,1578671869.0,"Right? Doctors are obviously the heroes of the story, but the patient was kind of a badass too. Walk away from a motorcycle crash with broken ribs, quietly get yourself on a plane (not saying it was *smart*, but badass), chill after having a hole cut in your chest cavity like nothing happened."
CozyPlaces,fdkufa1,t3_ejefgs,1578511373.0,That spread looks delicious. :drool:
geopolitics,fcymwc4,t1_fcym9kd,1578083008.0,Thank you!
geopolitics,fcxiqcb,t1_fcx769z,1578063934.0,What locals? Are there any significant separatist factions in Iran the way Iraq and Syria have the Kurds? IMO the one thing that would unite the government and the protesters would be an outside threat like the U.S. My impression was that Iran is more of a cohesive entity than its neighbors.

Also that charcuterie looks delicious"
