Take her to the vet and they will microchip her for you. My cat was a stray, no microchip and tattoo was unreadable and no one called the shelters. He had clearly been abused and/or neglected and most likely lived on the streets for a while. He started coming around the place I lived at the time which was with a bunch of roommates. We had a cat flap and this one winter he just showed up, wouldn't let me nor any of my roommates touch him. He came and went as he pleased. Over time though I took over feeding him and everything and he eventually let me pet him without hissing at me and trying to scratch me, he was very scared. He was about 14 according to the vet, broken tail bone, FIV, missing and rotten teeth, and other medical issues but he was a survivor and really flourished once I moved out on my own. I had him for 4 years, he passed end of 2017 and I miss him so much, he was an absolute doll just so affectionate and sweet.

exjw,fdnilv4,t1_fdmrhft,1578586576.0,"Exactly, you're under your parents roof, you're basically their property. Do you live in the US? I feel like the US justice system doesn't protect children enough. So many countries have banned corporal punishment. I'm from Canada and we still have it legal here as well however the law says you can't break skin, bruises, welts, etc. How can you hit someone without marks? It's so fucked up. I will say though that the police were called on my house a few times when I was a child from neighbors and the police would ask to speak to me to see if I was okay. Of course I said I was alright because I thought everything was my  fault back then.

Also about that ""I turned out fine"" BS, there have been numerous studies showing the connection between mental health problems and corporal punishment when the person is an adult. I can speak for myself and say that I have mental health problems and my father used corporal punishment towards me. I can't wait until it's fully banned in Canada and US. There are way more effective ways to discipline children.

And these corporal punishment apologists cannot tell me that a parent is not angry when they are hitting their kid. You know how some parents say ""This hurts me more than it hurts you"". Yeah sure! It's an adrenaline rush when you keep hitting someone full force when you're angry."

They can ban her from seeing her friends, using the phone, tv, video games, going outside and just walking around. Trust me it's best to just play along until you turn 18. It's hell and she can tell them how much she hates the cult and can laugh during family book study (that got me tackled and pinned to the ground by my 6'4 250 pound father swearing at me and calling me a little bitch while hitting me) but it won't do anything but make things worse.

She's got to stick it out and be a good sneak as many of us were at that age. Be good at leading a double life, that's my advice. Sounds like bad advice but it's the only way to get through it all without wanting to run away from home.

exjw,fd81iuz,t3_ek5pk5,1578212877.0,"Please start seeing a therapist or go to group therapy about your mental health. Group therapy is generally free and individual therapy can be free if you go to a doctor and show them how sick you are, they will set you up with a counsellor at a hospital. If you can't get in to see a counsellor at a hospital than there are many private counsellors who do sliding scale in your area, so it's way cheaper than full price. You just need to tell them a bit about your financial problems and what you're currently going through. Oh and about the group therapy, you don't have to share anything if you don't want and if you do you can just be vague.

I cannot stress enough how important it is for you to get some mental health support. Your husband cannot be the one helping you through this time, there needs to be PROFESSIONAL outside help. You can discuss things that you can't discuss with him. And I know Reddit can be really therapeutic but it's not the same compared to therapy. Please don't ignore and just think these feelings are going to go away, you need to address them now because it will get worse. Also if you have any suicidal thoughts, are extremely anxious all the time, very depressed, I would recommend you seeing your family doctor and they will set you up with a psychiatrist.

And I just want to say just because someone does or has done drugs doesn't make them a bad person. An example of a bad person is someone who loves you conditionally, with strings attached.
