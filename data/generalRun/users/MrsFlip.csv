I'm not saying this to detract from violence against homeless women at all, but let's not sweep other victims under the rug in the process.

WeightLossAdvice,ff8oyob,t1_ff8km3t,1579689642.0,"A little tip for this is to weigh the whole meal once cooked and whatever it weighs put in serving sizes of 1 gram or ounce if that's your jam. So I made a soup and the whole pot full minus pot weighs 700g. I put that it makes 700 servings of 1g apiece. Then when you eat some just tare a bowl on the scale, serve yourself and see what it weighs. If you take 200g for lunch then log 200 serves. Much easier than trying to divide it equally since you might eat more tomorrow. And you can put it in the log in advance to know how much you can take if you're running out of daily cals."

WeightLossAdvice,fexoljg,t3_eqplmq,1579434110.0,"Depends on a few factors. 1 pound of fat is 3500 calories. So to lose 40 pounds you need to have a total deficit of 140,000 calories below your TDEE. So for 180 days that's a deficit of 777 calories per day. Work out your TDEE (there are online calculators), minus 777, eat that much every day for 180 days. Done.  
  
The problem arises when you have a low TDEE, sometimes a 777 deficit won't be possible. For eg if your TDEE is 1677 then you'd have to eat 900 cal per day but that's not usually enough to get all your vitamins and minerals in and you'd be hungry AF. So you have to have a smaller deficit and lose more slowly. But if you can handle a 777 deficit and stick to it then sure, it's doable."
