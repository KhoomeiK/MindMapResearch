And I never claimed you were dumb either, just that you seem to be under some sort of delusion that you are so much more intelligent than everyone else here.  

Nothing googled, nothing claimed, and yet you continue to hurl baseless insults. Its disappointing how much time you've invested into being an asshole, I almost pity you. *Almost.*  

You still contradicted yourself, but you don't wanna hear it. You give excuses for why it was appropriate but it still happened, you cant change that. Take the L and save some face, champ."

I don't think that's just, I don't think that does Justice to the Constitution, and its insulting to poor people. Yes I believe that its insulting to poor people. Because it is basically insinuating that those poor people require assistance to be as successful, which I simply just cannot believe.  For example, *the guy who made Starbucks was very poor to start, but now he has something like 3 billion networth*"
