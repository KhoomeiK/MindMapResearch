movies,fekk1ik,t3_epmxxj,1579201673.0,I greatly agree. I personally thought the first three movies were a great trilogy imo. The 3rd is a tad long but still greatly enjoyable.
NLSSCircleJerk,fekjsrs,t1_fekgj6b,1579201527.0,"I was thinking the same, but Austin became a regular well before then. Like around 2015ish. Idk if that was it. Imo, it was due to world events. Nick was especially affected when Trump won the election in America and since then, politics seeped into the show, jokes or not. It kinda tainted it for me personally. It became more bitter, less fun to listen to, and that also kinda became a focus regarding the games they played. Nick was always fairly light on the harsh criticism of the games they played but at a certain point the show kinda didn’t pull punches when they disliked a new game, and that probably didn’t sit well with Nick because he often considers the developers and the possibility that they were watching during their shows. At least, this was my observation, doesn’t mean it’s correct."

confession,fejdpe3,t3_epgse6,1579168987.0,"I have a younger sister, I’m 25 she’s 21 now. I was horrible to her when I was your age, as well as when I was younger than you. I deeply regret how I treated her and I turned my new leaf regarding her when I was 16 or 17, but it was too late. She has stayed distant from me when I wish we were closer and are there for each other. But she hates me. And I love her so much and regret what I’ve done so much.

Please, please I beg of you. Treat your sister kindly. Protect her and have her back. She’s the only one you have (I assume). Apologize to her for all that you may have done to her in your life and stand by her like a brother should, like I should have."
NoStupidQuestions,fejdfyq,t3_epgt7f,1579168595.0,"Well, the loud bang part yes I think of gun. But I don’t have an underlying fear of being shot. Even in the worst of areas, you’re more likely to get in a car accident than be shot randomly. Most gun violence is personal. Those shootings, while tragic, are not a norm across the entire country. It’s still very irregular. Just remember who reports on it. The media tend to take things in unnecessary directions and extremes with this kind of stuff, especially foreign media."
Showerthoughts,fejdako,t3_epgw3h,1579168364.0,Actually true. Usually much more subtly and more interestingly. Adult movies just say the punchline and that’s it.

The same type of person who hides behind the excuse of “I’m just saying what everyone’s thinking” to excuse his shittiness toward others."
writing,feitclf,t3_epcskg,1579146686.0,"Tropes are tropes for a reason. They work. They make sense. Often times when people try to stay away from tropes, it usually ends up being messy or inconsistent. It’s okay to try to think of original concepts but people should stop looking down on tropes and just enjoy entertainment for what it is. Not everything needs to be deep or try to be original all the time."

todayilearned,fem2rm0,t1_felxsu0,1579237847.0,I donâ€™t see why the invention of either of these things needed to kill the ability for public transport across great distances that isnâ€™t a bus and was much faster than said automobiles.
todayilearned,felojoy,t1_fellw3o,1579227123.0,Remember when the US used to actually have cross country passenger trains and they GOT RID OF IT....FOR SOME REASON???
movies,fekk1ik,t3_epmxxj,1579201673.0,I greatly agree. I personally thought the first three movies were a great trilogy imo. The 3rd is a tad long but still greatly enjoyable.
NLSSCircleJerk,fekjsrs,t1_fekgj6b,1579201527.0,"I was thinking the same, but Austin became a regular well before then. Like around 2015ish. Idk if that was it. Imo, it was due to world events. Nick was especially affected when Trump won the election in America and since then, politics seeped into the show, jokes or not. It kinda tainted it for me personally. It became more bitter, less fun to listen to, and that also kinda became a focus regarding the games they played. Nick was always fairly light on the harsh criticism of the games they played but at a certain point the show kinda didnâ€™t pull punches when they disliked a new game, and that probably didnâ€™t sit well with Nick because he often considers the developers and the possibility that they were watching during their shows. At least, this was my observation, doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s correct."

I deeply regret how I treated her and I turned my new leaf regarding her when I was 16 or 17, but it was too late. She has stayed distant from me when I wish we were closer and are there for each other. But she hates me. And I love her so much and regret what Iâ€™ve done so much.

Please, please I beg of you. Treat your sister kindly. Protect her and have her back. Sheâ€™s the only one you have (I assume). Apologize to her for all that you may have done to her in your life and stand by her like a brother should, like I should have."
NoStupidQuestions,fejdfyq,t3_epgt7f,1579168595.0,"Well, the loud bang part yes I think of gun. But I donâ€™t have an underlying fear of being shot. Even in the worst of areas, youâ€™re more likely to get in a car accident than be shot randomly. Most gun violence is personal. Those shootings, while tragic, are not a norm across the entire country. Itâ€™s still very irregular. Just remember who reports on it. The media tend to take things in unnecessary directions and extremes with this kind of stuff, especially foreign media."
