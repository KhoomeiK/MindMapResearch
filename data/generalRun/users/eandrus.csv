Theoretically, your body will absorb the nutrients it needs from the vitamins and the rest will be filtered out of your body by your liver and kidneys. This assumes a normal dose, not eating handfuls of vitamins every day. If you were to do that, it will cause toxicity and your renal system may not be able to handle it. Unless your diet is great, you could benefit from a multivitamin or targeted vitamins to fill in the nutrient gaps you're missing from food."
