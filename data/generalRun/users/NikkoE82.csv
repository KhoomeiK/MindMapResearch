WaltDisneyWorld,fe262fu,t1_fe0hs6m,1578834860.0,"I get that, but by that logic why not just rebuild all the great rides from other parks at Disney World? Iâ€™m fine with Tron in general, but Iâ€™d prefer some differences to set it apart. Otherwise it feels too cookie cutter to me regardless of whether Iâ€™ve been on the original. Iâ€™ve never been to Disneyland Paris, but I donâ€™t want an exact copy of the Ratatouille ride either. I havenâ€™t read too much on that one, though, to know if it will be or not."
WaltDisneyWorld,fe23s1m,t1_fe06i44,1578834146.0,"I like the idea that you can get the same general ride but with unique flourishes depending on which park you go to. Theyâ€™ve done the same thing with other rides that get repurposed at other parks. Space Mountain, Pirates, Peter Panâ€™s Flight, Haunted Mansion, Big Thunder all have little differences at each park. I had read before that Tron will be the same track layout and everything. I would prefer to not get that. Apparently my opinion is controversial for some reason."
