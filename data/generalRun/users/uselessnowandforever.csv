PersonalFinanceCanada,fep9jr8,t1_fep0eru,1579315185.0,"Uh I beg to differ, I am way dumber when it comes to this stuff but am willing to consult multiple advisors to gain different perspectives on my situation. Thanks!"
PersonalFinanceCanada,fenrs27,t1_fejyj7i,1579289825.0,Should I go to a person at my bank? Or would it be a good idea to even go to a bank I don’t deal with and ask to speak to someone there as a prospective client??  Thanks!
PersonalFinanceCanada,fegfqap,t1_feexwud,1579091237.0,"I also dump items in my cart and wait! I have taken out so many items (money saved) by doing this. And same here, I realize I don’t need material things except clothes and stuff. My one luxury is going out for a coffee a day but otherwise have not spent a cent at a restaurant in a couple of years. I also rather spend money on experiences than items."
PersonalFinanceCanada,fegf8zo,t1_fees8jf,1579090755.0,"I’d like to get into investing (not the dump your money in an account for the bank to do as they please type, I already do that) but feel like I’m too dumb to even understand the most newbie of all newbie subs or articles about it."
PersonalFinanceCanada,fegf2jo,t1_feepykj,1579090573.0,"Yeah even if the numbers are astronomically higher than my own, I still manage to get some insight to apply to my own personal situations. Also I’m happy to see how everyone jumps in to help and supoort each other and love reading about positive posts about people who struggled and got their head above water, and the congratulations and support they get from here."
PersonalFinanceCanada,fegeu8c,t1_feeq41c,1579090330.0,True!
PersonalFinanceCanada,feges5r,t1_feenxgg,1579090269.0,"Yeah I agree that although I have some savings,  reading about other people’s savings has motivated me to be more agressive in saving more money."
PersonalFinanceCanada,fegeiy3,t3_eort5y,1579089989.0,"I am already depressed about a lot other things and have other issues but I am not in debt which is my first concern... so my standards are not terribly high, but neither is my interest in necessarily having the same lifestyle and assets as the posters here on this sub. 

Ex: I don’t need 6 figures to live because I don’t need to own a property. I didn’t feel the need either when I was married and neither did my late spouse. We just “invested” (ie spent) money in the (little) things that made us happy with our biggest spendings going to the two vacations we took (6000$ for our honeymoon). Neither of us drove to work but we had a car to use if needed. We lived just outside of downtown but 15 minutes door to door by subway to the downtown core.

I still enjoy reading about those with questions about assets I will never in my lifetime own, I like to read about various financial points of views, I can grab little insights from even a situation way above my head that I can apply or relate to a situation of mine. I don’t wish I was in anyone’s (positive) situation, just happy with the (luckily) fairly cheap interests I have in life. 

Fees for therapy are a bitch though. My psychologist is my biggest monthly expense. (Orherwise cheap rent, don’t go out, no expensive hobbies, no dependants, no spouse, .... no life...)"
SuicideWatch,fecwqer,t3_eoc598,1578987679.0,Yep alone at home in bed is how I plan.
SuicideWatch,fe6dxzh,t3_enygs4,1578888078.0,No. I just don’t talk to anyone anymore. Therapist and psych only but they couldn’t care less so I just deny and play along until one day I’m gone.
SuicideWatch,fe6djff,t1_fe6cnv7,1578887754.0,Same
SuicideWatch,fe6ddte,t3_ens9m1,1578887629.0,That’s why I haven’t told anybody I know except those I pay to help me and even then it’s useless so I’m just gonna play along and do as I please when I want.
SuicideWatch,fe0cu67,t3_eni396,1578810132.0,I used to feel this way just a few months ago but have progressed beyond caring about anyone now. I am not close to anyone anyway. People would get over it. No one is emotionally attached to me.
SuicideWatch,fe0couw,t1_fe08znf,1578809969.0,Me too.
SuicideWatch,fe0cna7,t3_enf3vy,1578809923.0,I get it. Me too. But I already have no one left.
SuicideWatch,fe0cjqo,t1_fe0ca1n,1578809817.0,Exactly. Same here.
PersonalFinanceCanada,fe0byct,t3_en4hin,1578809190.0,"They did not ask for anyone’s advice or opinion about their finances. So we can either be skeptical and ignore the post or celebrate with them for reaching a financial goal they set, no matter how easy or hard it was and whether or not they got « help »."
PersonalFinanceCanada,fe0bqd8,t1_fdwgkv1,1578808964.0,"For the last point, I have plenty of contribution room in both... so withdrawing rrsp (today... 25k) would not put a dent in my contribution room..."
PersonalFinanceCanada,fdzrqx0,t1_fdvpgdp,1578794257.0,"Which point are we missing here? They posted to celebrate with this community, not dissect the details and determine the difficulty. They set the goal, they reached it, they posted to celebrate. However easy or hard it was to do is not for us to determine nor is it the point of the post. People have difficulties beyond the technical financial details of saving. They did not ask for advice, they asked for support to celebrate and encouragement for the next steps. Congrats again, OP."
