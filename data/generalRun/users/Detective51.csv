WTF,fff31bg,t1_fff2ai9,1579874349.0,"It was a ready weird felling when I found this.  I have no interest in elephants, not children’s test about them.  I can’t figure out first off, how I found this, and second, why I looked for it, and third, why I though highly enough of it to save a copy in my pics."

interestingasfuck,fff1urm,t1_fff1gh1,1579873404.0,"It’s not a shit post, I found it interesting that I at some point last night, unknowingly I looked up tests on elephants.  My kids are all grown and adults now and I have no grandkids. I can’t think of a single reason I’d want to screenshot a 1st grade test about elephants."

aww,ffadb77,t1_ffaayxd,1579732858.0,"I told my wife when she got home a few minutes ago and she said she saw her climbing up it yesterday but old made it halfway up.  I guess she’s evolving.  I’m just glad she landed on soft clothes and not on the hard floor.  That’s about a 2 ft drop, which is a lot for such a tiny girl.  Btw, her name is Gracie as she is a full poodle.  My daughter bought her for my wife for Christmas.  Which was very sweet because she just has a part time job and Gracie wasn’t cheap.  She is so sweet and playful. An absolute joy to be around."

dankmemes,femu6cs,t1_fem88fy,1579269689.0,Do you know how tough it is to fap when you have a green flaccid arm with a dowel rod attached to it and controlled by a sketchy dude hiding behind a desk who does it all for the children?  Not easy. Not easy at all.
blursedimages,femt9fg,t1_femsww8,1579268966.0,"My dad put 4 spaces after periods.   We never found out why.   His dad used 5.     He was a great writer.     But not as good as his dad,          That, guy, had, his, own, problems,,           ."
blursedimages,femsww8,t1_fel1y6v,1579268682.0,I putt 3 spaces after periods.  It just seems safer that way.  I don’t recommend it though.   Someone might get hurt.

aww,fcts1hu,t1_fctkt9h,1577956516.0,"Men that love cats are usually kind and loyal.  My wife and I will have been married 25 years in the fall of this year and we’ve been together since middle school.  I know of 4 other guys in my profession (police) who openly talk about liking their cats and all 3 are on their first marriage, at least 11 years in so far, and are men of integrity.  Find a man that loves cats and you’ll find a man  who is kind, with a giant heart who doesn’t live their life to impress other people."
