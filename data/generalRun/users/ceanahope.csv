askwomenadvice,ffmbl2k,t1_ffm7xxe,1580051917.0,"Well I will respond which is a repost of my removed post with a change of one word.


I don't cater to their fragile ego.  I am 38 female in Tech and 15 years into my career.  I have a habit of calling them out directly in a one on one conversation in a hallway so they learn to check their ego around me.

 In the case of the coworker being upset you were doing the project, you can address it one on one, or in casual conversation.  Let them know you were given this project and the approval of the work comes from the boss.  And if you wanted input you would ask your boss, but you are not *required* to get input from your coworker who is a peer.

It took me a while to handle situations like this, but once I did, I found work less stressful.  You don't need to be mean.  Just direct, and not afraid to be called rude in several ways (because fragile egos think women setting boundaries is rude for some reason).  Perhaps some professional development work is needed for you.  Look into books on setting boundaries, which are super valuable in the professional world (especially if you are a female in a male dominated field).  You will feel more confident as you find your ability to speak up and be heard, people tend to want to ignore anyone younger than them ,and younger folks (I was there) tend to not know how to navigate it.

I believe you will do great.  Don't be afraid to leverage some one on one chats with your boss as well."

It has big names (previous years have had Ott, Tipper, Polish Ambassador, Desert Dwellers) and lots of international music.  Several spaces for talks and learning.  Great vibe, AMAZING venue and stellar staff.  I have attended for 5 years in a row now and never regret it.  I suggest pay extra for early entry on thursday as camping packs in quickly and don't pay extra for special parking unless you need it.  Additionally if you are solo please use a small tent (too many huge tents with one person using it causes issues for late arrival folks).

Another one, even smaller I have gone to once is Imagine on Orcas Island.  About 500 people.  On an island off the north coast of Washington in early September.  It is an epic adventure to get there and back, but they have a spa with sauna and hot tub, cool ocean water to swim in and great vibes, music and people.  I volunteered for this one, so I can't quote cost, but it was amazing (even dancing barefoot in the mud and rain)."

Your brother probably doesn't realize some women say yes because they are afraid of saying no too much, when in fact it is their right to do so and it should be accepted.  Trust me, going about it the way you are, listening and accepting their boundaries, is going to be the best in the long run.  I dealt with pushy guys so much, my current partner 100%gets when I say no and honors my boundary when I set it. Nour relationship is amazing, because of that, but because we also discuss both of our boundaries and respect them.

askwomenadvice,ff5x4w2,t3_erpuws,1579613176.0,"She is right about scented soap on the labia minora, however the outer parts should be wahed (pubes and labia majora)..  She is wrong about soap on her underwear.  If she has sensitive skin she should wash with a gentle scent free soap in the washer.  Honnestly it is the scents that cause most of the issues for womans bits.  I stick with organic soaps and have no issues.

Also is her underwear cotton or synthetic fibers?  That can cause smell issues as well.  Full cotton underwear is her best friend.  Synthetic lace undies, though sexy, are not as breathable and will more likely cause a funk when worn a day.

If she is worried about darkening armpits, get a deodorant with a photosensitive scent like burgmont or other citrus oil.  Exposure to light can bleach the skin.  Burgmont may make her smell a bit like a hippie."

witchcraft,fds8kaa,t3_emxc4k,1578696803.0,"Everyone has their own way of finding them.  I was raised Roman Catholic, was baptized and confirmed.  I started becoming interested in paganism when I was 16.

I didn't pick a specific diety and practiced for many years.  In 2007 I went to a pagan conference (Panthea Con) and was exposed to many different gods and goddesses.  I wanted to explore my options.  The second year I attended I had an interesting experience with the Kali ritual.  I felt like I was home, was brought to tears and could hardly speak.  I knew she was one of my goddesses.  A couple years later it happened with The Morrigan ritual.

I felt called to them.  Recently (Panthea Con February 2019) I had Dionysus appear, and has been added to the gods and goddesses I worship.

I can say the event definitely helped me refine my path, but it is not the only way to do it.  Some pick because of ancestral connections, others because they match their personality.  Some even pick them because they like the mythology of the God or goddess.

I went for 15 years without a god or goddess I worshiped, and it was fine.  In the beginning I worshiped just the general God and Goddess, which worked for me.

I wish you success on your journey throgh your faith and hope you get some great information from others here to guide you.  Don't feel pressured to find a god or goddess.  It is not a requirement."

I won't lie, it was scary but it all went well.   I was towards the end of the window to be able to do this.  It hurt physically, and obviously emotionally but it was for the right reasons.  It took a few hours to go throgh, a good 30 min or so that was brutal for me (we all have different pain levels, it may not be as bad for you).  I had normal uterine lining shed after, for a few days.  After it was done, I didn't have any pain and I seemed to go back to my normal baseline.  Following all after care your doctor recommends is best.

The process of getting started, not hard.  Have a day or two to recover, mostly emotionally if you need it.  Be gentle with yourself, this is not a decision any woman makes easily.  Have a heating pad, this will help with the cramps.  Stay hydrated and have someone you trust to call on standby, or with you if possible.  If you are alone then prep what you think you need (snacks, self care items, feminine hygiene products).

I wish I could say more but it has been a while.  Emotionally I still feel sad once in a while, but remind myself why I chose to do it.  You know what is best for you.  Best of luck and as I said, be gentle with yourself.  I hope you have someone who you can talk to if you need it."

Having control of who hugs you teaches you that you have control fo your own body and personal space, it also teaches boundaries and how important it is to respect them."

I did 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar, 1/4 cup baking soda and hot water that my scalp could handle and some tee tree oil.  Soak for 20 min then wash after.  I did this as a monthly maintenance wash/deep clean for my locks.  You can also add a little lavender oil as well if you wish.  Both tee tree and lavender are antifungal and soothing for the skin."
datingoverthirty,fcxlzrr,t3_ej7upm,1578066151.0,"I took 2 years off.  My 2 year time ended unexpectedly when I met someone in February IRL when I was not looking, but felt open to options if they came along.  We now live together and our relationship is the healthiest I have had in my life.  Honnestly the 2 years of not stressing over dates and sorting myself out after too many toxic relationships, it was the best decision I made.  At 38 I want to settle down with someone, but not just anyone.

What did I do with my time?

- worked on my health, ate better, focused on stress reduction, worked out and did yoga, meditated.

- traveled and had experiences alone.  I did 3 trips in that time 2 were solo camping trips that were two weeks long, the other was 2 weeks with a good friend.  I did a solo birthday hike instead of stress and over a party or any get togethers.  I enjoyed the quiet contemplations.

- read some good self improvement books.  The subtle art of not giving a fuck, boundaries where you end and I begin are two I read.  I also did some recreational stuff and enjoyed ready player one along with others.

- focused on my career.  I live in the bay area, it's expensive, I was struggling (still am, but less than I was before).  I am in a better situation financially.

- focused on my mental health.  I was depressed and needed to address issues.  Dropping that which added to the depression, what stressed me and didn't serve me.  Broke old habits that also contributed to my mental state.

- connected with friends I have not spent much time with due to some of these past toxic relationships.  I am still working on this, but there has been much improvement.

Overall, I feel it is a success.  Work is still ongoing, but 2 years was perfect to make substantial changes for my situation. I had no set end date and was just rolling through life and self improvement until my guy came along.  Funny thing, he was doing the same I was when we met at a convention.  A few months may be all you need, you my come to the end of your 3 month break and find you want more.  Set your end date as a check in date to see your progress.  Set some goals and don't beat yourself up if you miss the goal date.  Don't rush through the process.  Yoj know when you are ready."

When you click departure date, look for the month tab and use that.  It will give you lowest possible price that is color coded.  If it shows a magnifine glass, it may not be as low as you want, look at neighbouring dates."

bayarea,fckuxwi,t3_ehpwjo,1577733737.0,"35 minutes for travel would be if you left at 5 am.  I live in North east SJ and commute to Mountain view at 5:15 daily, it takes 35 minutes. I avoid 237 since the opened the Express lane as it seems to have made traffic worse.

I lived in Milpitas in 2007 and I remember the smell.  Ugh, so gross.  The town is quiet, which is nice, but ick.

Redwood City, Belmont or San Mateo would be a closer more reasonable option for distance.  The bay area has crappy traffic unless you commute super early like I do, and even then it can be horrible on occasion."
