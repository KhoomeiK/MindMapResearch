Odds are you will die pretty much the same time either way.

I have observed noticeably faster decline in cognitive skills in people with severe arteriosclerosis. And arteriosclerosis seems to be affected by diet."
SweatyPalms,fepdkrm,t1_feo2lfl,1579317882.0,">I have no idea how sloths have survived this long.

1. Sloths spends most of their lives on branches of trees. These branches are too thin to support predators big enough to kill sloth (and you can't use superior tactic „jump and break their spine“, because that would result in potentially lethal fall). 
2. Many predators react to movement more than shapes. By moving slowly, they avoid these.
3. Sloths are well camouflaged."

* ""Without prescription"" hypnotics can require prescriptions in other countries (in Poland, pure difenhydramine, known as Benadryl in English-speaking countries, is prescription-only. There is OTC difenhydramine with paracetamol to discourage misuse)

I doubt. USSR existed for 72 years and average lifespan in USSR was lower than 72 years (\~64 years in 1950). In 1926, USSR had 147 millions of population. Therefore, it's expected that more than 147 millions of people died in USSR, and 147 millions only in USSR is much higher than almost all of total estimates of worldwide communism-related deaths."

Becase of its strength. LSD is used in doses over 100 times smaller than most of other drugs here. 

>* Why is cannabis so easy to detect?

Because cannaboids are easily soluble in fats and metabolites stay in your fatty tissues for months.

Up to 10 days for metabolites.

Opium will be detectable for longer - it's mixture of different opiates."
