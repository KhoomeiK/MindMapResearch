They scan all the mail that will be delivered to you so if this ever happens in the future you will know what exactly was taken or when certain mail items arrived. I get daily e-mails telling me what will be in my box that day and anything sent to my address (mail and what not) automatically gets entered into their system as long as it's being sent via USPS. https://informeddelivery.usps.com/

With that being said I thought HW:DoK would offer a similar experience I ran into a game breaking bug in one of the missions where all the enemy units were destroyed but it said there was still one left. Got frustrated with the mission so I never ended up finishing it. I would personally look at getting the HW remastered games and pick those up on a sale."

Frugal,ff865u6,t1_ff7wsbd,1579667082.0,Probably the best fix for this is to buy your own modem and wifi router if you can. At the very least your own wifi router. Though before you do that see if you can manually change what channel your two networks are on.

technology,fecrkft,t1_feaa704,1578981940.0,"GEO generally has round trip latency of 600-750ms with bandwidth of as low as 2mpbs to 100mps (I have a lot of experience with geo constellation satcom and it depends on what satellite you're utilizing), whereas LEO, in my experience, has the same bandwidth constraints but generally has 100-150 ms response. Of course this was a smaller provider and 3-4 years ago but it's completely feasible with their new constellation to reach those speeds and response time. I will say that there are going to be a ton of issues when they first roll out but it's exciting none the less if they can reach that response time and close to the bandwidth. It will undoubtedly improve if they can continue to invest in satellites and ground stations.

personalfinance,fdlj5cv,t3_elshda,1578525171.0,"Late to the party but the initial rewards, occasional %0 interest rate, and cash back is more than worth it. We bought a mattress recently and didn't have the cash straight up to get it (I have major back problems so at the time it was a must). Used my discount but purchased it with a newly opened card that has a $200 bonus and cash back. I can easily pay it off before the 15 month window closes but instead of paying $2200 for a new mattress we'll walk away with really only having had to pay about 1500-1600.

I do this with utilities all the time as long as the card fee (generally %1-3 fee) doesn't outweigh the cash back. I've gotten thousands of cash back since starting this in 2015 and haven't paid a dime in interest. 

Store cards are awesome too. I'm talking about Best Buy/Home Depot/Lowes. A lot of Christmas gifts and projects went on that because they generally offer 6, 12, 18 months interest free depending on how much your total purchase costs. 

Discipline and being smart is definitely where credit pays off."

If you like getting a workout another cool rhythm game is BoxVR.

Arizona Sunshine is a decently fun game as well if you're into Zombie shoot em ups and there is a sequel as well.

I have a rift though so some other games I'd suggest are Oculus exclusives. You can play them through revive but I'm guessing you'd like (and rightly so) want to keep everything on Steam.

Seconding the get one game at a time as well."

Ideally in the future I'll separate them into their own VLANs and/or go completely POE and block them completely.

I have a couple Wyze cameras because 1) they're dirt cheap 2) they work decently. Unfortunately they require a heart beat back to where ever they reach back to so I can't completely separate them but I can minimize my exposure and VLAN them off.

Android,fdf3qal,t1_fdek75d,1578352614.0,"Ahh gotcha. I don't know where they are physically located. That was just one of the addresses that OP had determined was being sent out from his phone that I also saw in my logs.

As far as the address space belonging to Amazon or not shouldn't matter much as once it hits their cloud the ultimate end point would be near impossible (or at the very least difficult) to trace. 

[See here](https://amcrest.com/forum/ip-cameras-f18/constant-external-ip-requests-t1590.html) about Chinese camera manufacturers using AWS and the seemingly nefarious constant reach backs.

**TEMPORARY FIX**

&amp;nbsp;

**With root:**

1. Install [AdAway](https://adaway.org/) or any other adblocker.

2. Blacklist the following domains:

* *.360.cn
* *.360safe.com

&amp;nbsp;

**Without root:***

1. Create an account on [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/) and copy the **DNS-over-TLS** address from the **NextDNS &gt; Setup** tab.

2. In the **NextDNS &gt; Blacklist** tab, type out these domains and hit Enter (no need for leading asterisk):
 * 360.cn
 * 360safe.com

3. If on Android 9 (or newer), go to Settings &gt; Connections &gt; More connection settings &gt; **Private DNS** and paste the DNS-over-TLS address.

4. On older Android versions, download [Intra](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.intra) (by Google) or the [NextDNS app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.nextdns.NextDNS) and use the **DNS-over-TLS** address to setup the app.

&amp;nbsp;

**This is not ideal, but it's better than nothing. It does require trusting a third party (NextDNS) with all your DNS queries. A better alternative might be to setup your own adblocking DNS server.*"
Android,fdeezal,t1_fde8v03,1578337572.0,"It is working as intended. For instance I can review the logs and see my geo block getting hits every 5-10 seconds and then do a whois on those addresses.

Android,fde0yg8,t3_ektg8u,1578328705.0,"Interesting..... I have updated my firewall rules and Pi-hole to block the domains and associated IP addresses. (For some reason my Geoblock rule didn't catch it but I suppose I am only blocking it for incoming connections).

I checked insight over the last month or so and it appears that only one device (my phone) had contacted only one of the IP addresses since that time. (We currently have a Samsung Tab A, and two S9+ in the house). It contacted via HTTP 54.76.6.111 on Jan 2 (so a whole 3 days before this post). Though that doesn't mean it's not being whitewashed by connnecting through some AWS servers as well as this is a known tactic that some Chinese camera manufacturers use.

oculus,fdc0ruz,t1_fd8saav,1578264894.0,"Again thanks for the honest and in depth feedback. Definitely a lot to consider. 

I'll probably continue to use the CV1 as you suggested and go with the Index when they're available. I'm really happy overall with Oculus and the support they've given me so far. 

I do think I'll start building my library in Steam though because as you said their platform is really HMD agnostic and only purchasing Oculus exclusive games (if there are any worth buying that I don't already own).

oculus,fd6hkzn,t1_fd697pk,1578191133.0,"I actually mentioned side grade in another reply and another post. IPD is the interpupillary distance (i.e. distance between your pupils) Mine is around 70 or so (big head) so that limits me right now really to the Quest or Index. The computers we have are great and are at least current gen or 1-2 gen behind. I agree the CV1 is fine except as of now there is no option for cable replacement. Trying to get suggestions to basically pay once cry once kind of thing. The CV1 I have is still good and luckily I have a back up cable but I'm wanting to weigh the options of transitioning to a different platform (and dealing with revive) or going with the current 1.2 gen (which everything really is compared to the CV1 like you mentioned, they're not true upgrades).

Biggest thing the quest has is the PCVR link, portability for us on trips, and the adjustable IPD (for my big head). Index would be ideal but it's out of stock and probably isn't worth the grand to spend as I already have a great headset."
oculus,fd6azwk,t1_fd651zo,1578188222.0,Thanks for the input. Someone else suggested the Quest. Might not be a bad compromise to keep using the CV1 for myself and letting my son use the Quest. Did you have to go with an active extension? I had to go through quite a few combination of extensions to get the right combination for my CV1 to work with all three sensors and the headset.
oculus,fd6aqsc,t1_fd65a80,1578188115.0,"That's actually not a bad idea. The CV1 I have still works perfect and I've got my main rig and VR rig (real similar specs) so we could have some fun with that. I think instead of getting 2 quests though I'd like get him a quest and keep the CV1 for me (since I'm better at knowing how tangled up I am). We already play a lot of Minecraft, Left for Dead, and some other games together. Wish our Best Buy did demo's. The one I bought my CV1 from did demos every Thursday or something. It would also be great for the occasional road trip we do (instead of lugging the VRPC around could just take the Quest).

I would like to stay with Oculus as my experience with them has been great but supporting Valve would be cool too.

Thanks for a really different perspective on this. Definitely a lot to consider. Biggest downside for this is having to pretty much spend twice the money on VR games and the flat games we play. Honestly though I think the only ones I'd have to rebuy are the job/vacation simulator ones so he could enjoy it on the go as those are his favorites."
oculus,fd63uav,t1_fd6196q,1578185157.0,:( Biggest oversight on the S for Oculus in my opinion. Probably a cost saving measure.
oculus,fd602mx,t1_fd5le1p,1578183677.0,"I use extensions as well. It always helps for when my son or one of his friends walks too far and unplugs the extension instead of dragging the computer with it.

My Rift is way out of warranty but fortunately they replaced my headset a couple months back so I have spares of everything. I'm just at the point where I need to decide if I want to use the new cable or salvage it and switch to another device (already leaning towards just using it and getting an Index when they're available)."
oculus,fd5zpdz,t1_fd5jgoa,1578183540.0,Yeah I keep hearing that. Someone in another thread agreed it was more of a side grade. I don't mind not having inside out tracking as I currently have no issues whatsoever with my 3 sensors. Beat Saber had a little weird issue awhile ago but that's probably due to a mod I'm guessing. I also am unaffected by the new update where I see tons of S and Quest owners complaining about it.  Really hoping the Pro has adjustable IPD though otherwise Index or another WMR (which WMR isn't worth it IMO).
oculus,fd5yyqb,t1_fd51uz4,1578183274.0,"Thanks a lot for the input. I like your idea about keeping the CV1 as either a back up or for not having to deal with Revive in addition to the other platforms I have games on.

Might even be worth it to get another working headset off eBay for that reason. I've seen quite a few that look like they're in good condition for relatively cheap.

What's your take on the Index? Is it really worth a grand? Or would you, knowing what you know now, wait to get one used? I don't expect them to be available for purchase again until probably close to summer and the cost really isn't too big of an issue but I don't think I'll be blown away by any viable 'upgrade' right now.

Also I don't have any experience with other headsets audio but I can say the CV1 seems like it's a really solid build overall, and the sound is fairly immersive (compared to my Sony with noise cancelling on flat gaming)."
oculus,fd4t98h,t1_fd4rvu1,1578170861.0,I've seen that too. I'll play around a bit with the bad cable and see if I can't give Cable Guardian a try. Honestly it's mostly my son that has a hard time with knowing where he is spatially when he's playing. I'm generally pretty good about knowing where or how tangled I'm getting.
oculus,fd4sih8,t1_fd4pdt4,1578170711.0,That's definitely a good suggestion too. I think I'd be able to even get close to the cost of the 64gb version (or I could be a complete douche and sell my good cable for $160 on eBay :/). Have you already purchased the link cable?
oculus,fd4pe3d,t1_fd4nvpk,1578169737.0,That's kind of what I'm leaning towards. The CV1 is still great (though I don't have anything to compare it with). I had the CV1 for about 2-3 months before I took protective measures with cable loom and tying a safety loop at the headset so I think most of the damage was done by then and it still lasted me about a year and a half.
