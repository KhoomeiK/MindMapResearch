They are, in turn, fascinated by their friendly visitor who scratches to come in and rubs affectionately on the glass at them. 

At first I was worried he was a stray but I’ve begun to suspect he’s just a neighbors cat. He doesn’t have a collar but he:

1.) Only appears during certain hours of the day when a human might reasonably be expected to have let the cat out

2.) Is a chonker, clearly well fed

3.) Seems familiar with how to signal wanting to come into a house 

I’d love some tips for figuring out who this cat might belong to. He’s got no collar to attach notes to, and I’m afraid that if he does belong to someone I would worry the owner by “abducting” him to go check for a chip. Our neighborhood is pretty large so it’s not like I can go door to door asking. I guess maybe I could put pictures up?  Not sure, and I’d rather not introduce him to our cats without knowing he’s vaccinated, even though all involved parties seem curious rather than aggressive."
Fitness,ffq8mdh,t3_eu8vka,1580126026.0,"If your goal is to just do a certain distance, then slow down.

You’ve got to use what I call the “juicebox technique.”  Pretend your endurance is a resource: a tiny little kids sized juicebox and you’ve got to make it last through your entire lunch, which unfortunately is a dry sandwich and pretzels. It would feel good and natural to take a big gulp of juice right after the first few bites of food, but remember you’ve got the whole lunch to get through, so you have to take sips that are much smaller than you’re used to. Treat your endurance that way. Don’t spend it all at the beginning, gradually titrate it out. A pace that feels comically slow on mile 1 will feel pretty smart at mile 6 and beyond. You should be able to hold a conversation comfortably if you’re running a long distance for the first time (or for a casual training run).

So they didn’t invent that for the movies, that was accurate. 

That scene was always meant to feel a bit....cheap, unearned, even vindictive. A big part of why Ron was doing it was because he was mad at Hermione. It wasn’t meant to feel celebratory. I think the movie did tolerably well at conveying that sentiment. 

On the other hand, the Harry and Ginny scene, while superficially similar to the Ron and Lavender scene, was supposed to feel like the photo negative of it. The culmination of their mutual attraction, not a spontaneous immature fling. Harry, being a (lovable) moron didn’t really pick up on the fact that Ginny was still into him after all those years, not until that moment.

The amount your metabolism declines between age 20 and 40 is actually pretty negligible.

But starving isn’t necessary to lose weight. Not even close.  The trick is to pick foods that fill you up without being high in calories. This is one of the main reasons why salads and other vegetables are considered healthy. Lots of mass, not a lot of energy. Total opposite of a large order of fries or a few IPAs that pack an obnoxious amount of calories into a small space that leaves you feeling hungry afterward.

loseit,fe8pgzg,t1_fe8fdd5,1578928867.0,"Well, like I said, these kinds of things can be pretty individual so I’d encourage you to seek therapy if your symptoms are hard to manage, but here are some things that seem to work for me:

* Cut down or eliminate alcohol. If you drink regularly this can be a tall order, but even a reduction helps a ton. Alcohol fucks with your sleep even when you don’t realize it. 

* Try to get sunlight during the day. This can be hard with a full time job when the sun rises and sets during working hours, but maybe take a walk on your lunch break. 

* Vitamin D supplements have been outstanding. Taking vitamin D when you can’t get enough sunlight to produce your own vitamin D internally has been shown to improve mood and it certainly seems to work for me. Realized I hadn’t been taking my multivitamin in weeks. Fixed that right up. 

* Get a normal sleep schedule. Get at least 7-8 hours if you possibly can. Put your phone down, turn the lights off, and sleep, even if you’re going to bed comically early

* Hydrate yourself. /r/HydroHomies  You’d be surprised how depressed and irritable you are if you’re not drinking enough water. 

* Take some goal directed action. Physical activity is best since it also produces endorphins (I run and lift) but anything that keeps your mind focused on a goal seems to help. Honestly getting out on the highway to road trip to family for the holidays seemed to work wonders, even just the driving for an extended time managed to activate that “working towards a goal” mentality 

* If you’ve got a significant other, sex helps, for obvious reasons. I know the prospect can seem daunting if you’re really in the throes of depression but it’s worth it for so many reasons. Intimacy is great. 

* Breathing exercises can help by delivering a combination of relaxation+purpose. I suspect that the sense of control gained from sustained attention to your own breathing is a big factor in why it helps mood. 

* Go easy on yourself. The aforementioned anger that can go along with the depression almost always gets turned inward. I have enough self control not to snap at other people when I’m experiencing this, but I can’t quite stop from beating up on myself. Just try to remind yourself that the feelings are not reflective of your actual worth, that this is simply a maladaptive neurochemical response to a specific situation. You are not a bad person, or a failure, or any of the other things that might echo in your head most loudly while depressed. You are more than that, and the cacophony of self-critique will fade if you let it. Feel the emotion, accept it, and don’t rage against it. Rage is non-discriminatory, and rage at *your feelings* very quickly becomes just another wave in the cycle of rage against *yourself*.  Instead, let the anger and the self-loathing wash off you like waves breaking on a tall protective wall. The waves exist, but they do not break you. Calmly tell yourself “I am feeling this way. It’s not true, but I’m feeling this way. Things will improve. I am doing my best, and I am better than how I feel right now.  It will be ok.”  Try some of that breathing. And it WILL be ok."

Right now it’s “playable and fun.” But if it wants to achieve real destiny/division/diablo/borderlands status it needs much more endgame polish. It needs wider build options, a stat sheet, more types of currency and activities, more robust crafting, etc.

The fat is your body’s emergency storage and you need to make your body burn up that storage for calories instead of using calories you eat. So you have to eat less. Use a free online TDEE calculator to figure out what your baseline number of calories per day would be, the number of calories you’d need to stay the same weight.
