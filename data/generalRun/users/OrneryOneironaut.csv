Catchy headline, “Biden says video games teach you how to kill people”, but c’mon - was the reddit karma worth distorting the facts? Not like anyone’s gonna read the full transcript anyway...and there were bigger gaffs from him than this one, shitty, contrived takeaway. Christ’s sake."

Normally I feel euphoric when I work myself to the point where my body is dripping/trembling, but right now I just feel downright demoralized. Whoever designed/QA'd this level (and the hinge pose exercise) deserves a special place in hell."
