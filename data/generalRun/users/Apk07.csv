xmpp,ff9svch,t1_ff8qjv9,1579720518.0,"Yeah I'm really just sending to and listening for stuff from one specific remote server. I have no control over this remote server, its by a third party I'm working with that is much larger than myself, so I have no pull over asking for changes or anything to their architecture/code. 


Their idea is to send to messages to {anyone@myserver.com} where ""anyone"" doesn't necessarily exist on my end, because I'm not actually running an XMPP server, just a TCP listener. I get these and handle them by converting the messages into data that my own software/database/APIs understand. It would act as a sort of catch-all user that captures all incoming messages regardless of their intended delivery recipient.


Then the inverse is true as well, I need to send messages from my {random@myserver.com} off to their server's *real* users/usernames.


You can think of this whole idea as an adapter of sorts. Using/consuming their server's stuff and adapting it to work with my own internal APIs and software. Linking the two so they can interact, despite me not actually running any XMPP stuff.


This is proving pretty difficult, though, which is why I started poking around existing XMPP server software that might be able to be adapted to do this... We are strictly a .NET/Windows shop, so whatever it is has to run on Windows, nothing Linux, Java, PHP, etc."

dotnet,fengwfn,t1_feng1qr,1579284429.0,"You can use a REST API just for internal use if you want. If you're just having one program on Server A query another program on Server A, REST services still work perfectly fine. 

The added benefit is you can ""expose"" this service to other remote servers and clients and other programs with little effort if need be.

There is also nothing really stopping you from having a WebAPI project and tossing your WCF into it as well. They can run in tandem. Obviously if .NET Core doesn't have WCF that wouldn't work, but if you are hanging back on 4.x at all you could keep both."
dotnet,fenghe3,t1_fenf8ks,1579284173.0,"For REST, look at WebAPI (for .NET 4.x and also .NET Core).

It is the basic concept of making controllers and functions for sending and receiving data over HTTP/HTTPS.

For instance you can have a ""Controller"" named ""CustomerController"" and then functions like List, Create, Get, etc...

So you then issue a GET request from a client (another program's code behind, javascript, the browser itself, anywhere really) to 

    /customer/get?id=123

And return appropriate customer data, like results from your database or a class of compiled info in JSON or XML.

Once you get into the basics, it becomes a pretty simple concept to incorporate. You usually read stuff with a ""GET"", and write stuff with a ""POST"" or ""PUT"". There are other verbs like DELETE and stuff but they're optional unless you're really following all the rules.

Its nice because REST is a pretty universal standard so almost anything can consume it. Most APIs you find for third party services online are all REST-compatible as well. The browser or program you're reading this Reddit message on probably retrieved its info via an HTTP GET which is part of REST. Same with the Reddit logo."

What we're doing is acting as a sort of SMS gateway for someone else's XMPP shenanigans. They have a working product based on XMPP but they want to add SMS (via us) into it. 

Their idea is to treat us as a federated server, where we just have a little TCP listener waiting to see a message go out to phone@domain.com. They federate that over to us, we pick it up, and send it to our own API's (REST/HTTP).

We will also poke them to send a message out on someone's behalf. Lets say one of our users (REST/HTTP) wants to tell an XMPP guy ""how are you"", then we basically pretend we are an XMPP user and send to them.

Its kind of convoluted and confusing, both to me and to everyone else trying to understand it. Obviously the best solution would be for this company with XMPP to just spam us HTTP POSTs instead of doing this federation BS, but they refuse to modify their code (and it is likely they can't because they may be using premade software).

Basically all I have at the moment is a plain old TcpClient() in .NET blasting packets of XMPP-ish XML over to them. I get responses (in XMPP-ish XML), where it says stuff like TLS and Dialbacks required, but that's as far as I've gone.
