Columbine,ff6d1lj,t1_fbw07x1,1579624540.0,I think instead of simply being a cold blooded psychopath Eric was simply a narcissist. He felt superior to everyone else and that killing them is justified because in his mind they were never worthy of life anyway. If you’ve ever checked out r/raisedbynarcissists you would see that it’s not uncommon for a narcissist to be really cold and uncaring about the people around them even if it’s something like parents or their own children let alone strangers or classmates
Columbine,ff6c8j8,t1_fcmpji5,1579624032.0,"I read her book too and it hit me hard as well. If Sue is still in denial then I really don’t blame her either. What Dylan did to his entire family was like saying: “you know how you always loved me and tried to raise me into being a kind, responsible and respectful person? Well fuck you for even trying! In fact, I’m going to do the opposite even if it ruins your life!”. What he did with Eric was possibly the most selfish and rotten thing he could’ve ever done. And he didn’t even give his family a chance to ask him why. He put a gun to his head right there in the school."
Columbine,ff6bxgw,t1_fbscwaf,1579623837.0,"I totally agree with you on that one. I’ve been reading Sue’s book and from what she’s said about Dylan from infancy to adolescence I can see a lot of aspects of Dylan in myself (I’m not talking about the homicidal/ suicidal tendencies) because Sue did something the Harrises never did- she humanized Dylan. 

She took the time to write a book basically saying “here’s the son that I knew and loved and here’s how that differs from the person he actually was”. I would love to see the same for Eric because I think if we do then there might be some way to see if there were missed clues and how anyone could detect them and stop the next Columbine.

If we were to get the same glimpse into Eric’s life growing up it might uncover another piece of the puzzle we’ve been missing. Something had to have planted the idea into their heads that not only was this ok, but it was the right thing to do. What they did was tragic and uncalled for in every single way but it was also a slap in the face to their parents. 

When I was reading Sue’s book I thought that if it was all true then it was a cruel slap in the face from Dylan to his family that basically said “you know how you tried your best to raise me into a mature, responsible adult that had love in his heart? Well fuck you for even trying!”.

I know it was long but hey if you got through this rambling mess I appreciate it"

From what I’ve observed as long as you keep the kids minds busy with things that aren’t screens their natural curiosity kicks in and they are little sponges who want to soak up all the information they can get. If you take that away from them and put them in front of the tv or tell them to go watch YouTube and not bother you that’s when you start to stunt the growth."
