Magic in the HP universe is treated very similarly to technology: it has rules, it starts of with simple spells (like simple machines) built up to larger and larger constructions.  

The original question was ""why aren't all the kids super excited to do magic?"" Well, the answer is the same reason kids in real life aren't super excited to learn math.  Math is the basic building block that allows humanity to accomplish everything humanity has accomplished! Yet some children aren't at all excited about it. 

The magic in the Harry Potter universe is shown to be a little boring to learn (lift a feather?  How banal!), difficult to perform well, predicated by ridiculous amounts of wealth (pretty much all the kids at a prestigious boarding school are loaded and if they are poor, they perform magic worse), and sometimes painful, sickening and potentially injurious (portkeys and apparition are described in awful detail, and apparition can result in splinching).  And in canon, magic can only be performed with a wand (a tool).

I can levitate myself by building and sitting in a chair, I can apparate myself by taking a bus, I can create electricity by mixing a metal and a liquid.  The only difference between Harry Potter's magic and the real world is the factor of time.  And if it takes years to become proficient at a time-saving piece of magic, how much time will you end up saving in the long run?"
Unexpected,ff78c1s,t1_ff727es,1579643111.0,This was the first thing that came to mind.  I wore the hell out of our copy of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves!  It looks as though I could watch it again and it may still hold up!
Dualsport,ff6um69,t1_ff6s28y,1579635210.0,"I don't consider electric motorcycles to be ""e-bikes.""  As far as motorcycles go, almost any dual sport or dirt bike made for an adult is going to be tall.  I would have loved an [Alta Motors electric dirtbike](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Ca5gNPbhk), but they folded I think two years ago"

Since we know there are assassins, we can assume they get paid."
Jokes,ff6sz7t,t3_erpnx3,1579634250.0,"If a dude has a small dick, let him have a cool car.  Why do we expect him to have to suffer through life *more*."
HPfanfiction,ff6ssog,t1_ff5r3q0,1579634141.0,"That's just being rich.  Why don't you study real hard, get rich and have all your chores just magically do themselves?

It's because you're just as lazy as most people, and the effort it takes to have all your chores done by someone else exceeds the effort of just doing your chores."
HPfanfiction,ff6sh79,t1_ff5y546,1579633948.0,"Ok, you're gonna have to open your mind.  We have so much magic that we treat it as mundane or boring because we're used to it.  Why dont people absolutely marvel in the wonders of our technologies?  It's astoundingly amazing and essentially magic in the same vein as the HP universe: it has rules, we have to learn it, it takes a very long time to get good at it, and it's built off the shoulders of giants!

We can fly, but still it's not enough!  We can move around in cars and motorcycles, either gas or electric, essentially teleportation!  But it's not good enough!  We have preserving charms for our food, nutritional and flavor charms, too. We can predict the weather, and sometimes control it!  We have almost all the knowledge of the world in our pocket, and we can converse with almost anyone, almost anywhere in the world in real time!

And it's still not good enough.

It all about changing your perspective.  We all know that if we studied super hard, we could focus on one specific topic and move mountains, but instead, most of us just want to dick around reading silly stories and playing games.  Just like the boys at Hogwarts!"
