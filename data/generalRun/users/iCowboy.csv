He is a terrible gossip, not always reliable but a lot of fun. Most importantly, he was also there and he was very careful to distinguish between what he saw, what he read, what he was told and what was gossip. He also made it clear what he did and didn’t believe.

Fortunately, his ‘Histories’ is well and truly out of copyright:

https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Herodotus

In the case of the pyramids, the Greek sources are almost the only texts we have about those pharaohs; the Egyptian sources are almost entirely silent - there are almost no contemporary writings about them and in the case of Khufu, the only definite portrait we have of him is a little ivory sculpture that would fit in your hand!"
pics,ffbwqkw,t1_ffbbt8t,1579785283.0,"The pyramids are from Dynastic Egypt - somewhat later than the PreDynastic Era. Specifically, the Giza pyramids are from the Fourth Dynasty.

There is some suggestion the Egyptians used giant saws to cut the soft limestone of Giza, but there’s no mystery how they cut granite because their quarrying can still be seen at Aswan. 

Where possible they would crack blocks of granite along existing cracks or weaknesses, or they would drill a series of holes using a bowsaw and quartz grit into a solid block. Then they inserted wooden wedges into the holes and pounded them into place. The wedges would be wetted, they would expand and eventually crack the rock. Some modern experimental archaeologists have also used copper flat-bottomed saws and quartz sand to cut granite, so that might also have been used by the Egyptians.

For the very largest blocks - such as obelisks - it was quarried by pounding the rock with balls of dolerite, some of which are still in the quarries. An outline would be marked on the surface and teams would gradually sink trenches around the object until the required depth had been reached, they they would gradually undermine it to form a keel before it was released from the rock. It must have been backbreaking work, hopelessly uneconomic to our eyes, but the Egyptians has time and endless cheap labour.

If you ever get a chance, visit the quarries at Aswan, they are astounding and you can still see an entire obelisk almost ready for deliver - except it has cracked which must have been heartbreaking for everyone."

The Giza pyramids are the northernmost of three huge pyramid fields from Saqqara in the South, which is close to the then capital of Memphis, through Dahshur and eventually Giza.

All of the pyramids were sited on the edge of the Western Desert, which was symbolic to Egyptians because the so-called Red Land was dangerous and not for the living and the West was where the Sun sank in the evening for its journey through the Underworld. So almost all of the major funerary monuments in Egypt are on the West Bank of the Nile.

Pyramids were also designed to appear on the horizon when seen from the river valley, which means they usually sit on the low bluffs and plateaux of the Nile river valley. Earlier construction at Saqqara and Dahshur had used up many of the prime spots so the work moved to Giza which was also blessed with immensely quantities of easily quarried limestone.

Their position was also governed by the need to bring construction materials, such as granite and the white casing stone from Tura in the East bank to the site. So they were close to the edge of the Nile floodplain; during the season of Inundation, waters would rise and huge blocks of stone could be brought to the edge of the construction site. This no longer happens because of the Aswan High Dam, but there are photos from the 19th and early 20th Century showing lagoons very close to the pyramids almost so they appear to be floating in water."
pics,ffbv2qp,t1_ffbre98,1579783749.0,"The ptolomeic Egyptians knew who built the pyramids and why they had been constructed. However these pharaohs had been mythologised to some extent and legends had grown up about them. 

For instance, according to the Greek historian Herodotus, Khufu (known to the Greeks as Cheops), was thought to have been an excessively cruel king who forced his entire country to labour on the pyramid and even forced his own daughter to work in a brothel to help raise money for the construction. The legend, according to Herodotus, continues that she asked each of her partners to give her a stone which was used to build one of the small satellite pyramids next to the Great Pyramid. 

There is, of course, absolutely no evidence that this was the case and the stories of cruelty and slavery in the construction of the pyramids is almost certainly down to the Greeks - a slave owning society - not thinking there was any other way of raising large monuments.

The third pyramid, that of Menkaure, was also the subject of legends in a Greek times. It is MUCH smaller than its two partners and some of the granite casing stones low down on the flanks are unfinished. The Greeks had it that Menkaure (Mykerinos to them) received a prophecy that he would only reign for six years, so he ordered his crews to build the pyramid under torch light effectively doubling his reign, but not giving him time to build a large pyramid. 

This cannot be true since the dimensions of the pyramid were set before actual construction, so the relatively small size of Menkaure’s pyramid are down to him not having the same resources as his ancestor. But he might have died unexpectedly since the unfinished state of his pyramid and the fact much of the surrounding temples were constructed in mid suggest it was finished in a hurry, possibly after a reign of 18 - 22 years. One upside for him, the Greeks said he was thought of as a just and kind ruler who alleviated the suffering caused by Khufu and Khafre - though this is again apocryphal."

The quarries are all around the site, although many of the early ones which supplied stone for the Great Pyramid were buried by rubble from later construction. You can visit some of the quarries and see the cutting faces from where rocks were extracted using wooden wedges; and the worker villages are also close by.

Some stone wasn’t local, the fine white limestone casing (some of which is still in place on the cap of the second pyramid), came from the quarries at Tura on the other bank of the Nile and would have been shipped across using rafts. During the time when the pyramids were under construction, the annual flooding of the Nile would have brought water close to the site and allowed them to bring blocks almost to where they were needed. The other significant rock used in the pyramids was granite from Aswan in the South of Egypt. This was used in much smaller quantities for lining the burial chamber of the Great Pyramid, the sarcophagus and also for some of the casing of the third pyramid. This was an extraordinary achievement since the stone is incredibly hard, it is beautifully carved and some of the blocks are more than 60 tonnes in weight."
pics,ff9ytt9,t1_ff9vd7r,1579724430.0,"The stones in all three Giza pyramids are beautifully cut and precisely laid with almost no gap between blocks, so it is very hard to get any purchase on a stone in order to move them out of position. They’re also huge, I’m not sure how big the stones are in the third pyramid, but the average size of stones in the Great Pyramid built less than fifty years before is 2.5 tonnes with some up to 70 tonnes in mass.

This is in comparison to the stones in other pyramids, both before and after the Giza cluster which tended to use smaller blocks and often had very roughly-laid cores which made them much easier to demolish for building stone and especially for lime burning."

The Earth contains lead that originated in the Solar Nebula from which the Sun and the Earth formed. 

Lead has four stable isotopes 204Pb, 206Pb, 207Pb and 208Pb. Of these, 204Pb is called a 'primordial nuclide' which means it is not formed by the decay of heavier atoms; instead it is made in supernovae. It makes up about 1.4% of all the lead found on Earth. So we can definitely say that 1.4% of the lead down here is not from radioactive decay and came from the Solar Nebula.

The three remaining isotopes can also be made in supernovae, but are  each the final result of a chain of radioactive decays from uranium, actinium and thorium respectively. This is called radiogenic lead.

There is a method of radioactive dating called lead-lead dating which uses changes in the concentration of radiogenic lead isotopes with time compared to their primordial values. It is the method most commonly used to date especially ancient rocks and meteorites."

askscience,fe2t881,t3_ennltn,1578842600.0,"Different elements have different chemistries which mean they do not crystallise together, instead one element will be separated from others when crystals form from magma or solution.

As a simple example, uranium eventually decays to lead which means that U-Pb dating is a standard method of dating rocks containing reasonable amounts of uranium. When the rock forms, uranium is concentrated in certain minerals, but the chemistry of uranium is sufficiently different from that of lead to ensure the crystals containing uranium initially contain essentially no lead.

We have to assume that the crystal is ‘closed’ - that is no atoms can leave or enter the crystal. As time passes some of the uranium atoms in the crystal will decay into lead. A crystal that once contained no lead will accumulate lead at a fixed rate from the decay of uranium. Essentially, dating requires finding a suitable crystal and measuring the proportion of lead to uranium.

There are many complications, essentially if the crystal is not closed - it might be cracked which would allow water to enter the crystal or it can be reheated sufficiently that the products of decay can escape - all of which will throw off the dating. This is a real problem for dating where the decay product is a gas such as the popular potassium argon method. 

For this reason, geologists love rocks containing the mineral zircon which often concentrates uranium, is immensely tough and closes at very high temperatures which means that it can survive pretty much everything short of complete melting.

Selecting suitable crystals can be really challenging and involve lots of crushing, cleaning and picking out individual crystals by hand."

As well as volcanic emissions, the PETM carbon has also been suggested to have been released by cooking of organic sediments which are widely distributed in the UK and Ireland.

Essentially, and keeping it very simple, Amenhotep IV followed his father to the throne and quickly assumed the new name Akhenaten. At this time he started moving the country towards monotheism and the worship of the Sun god Aten. Akhenaten married the fabulously beautiful Nefertiti who seemingly appears from nowhere and went on to have at least six daughters and one son. 

Late in his reign, it gets very complicated - a new pharaoh Smenkhare is named alongside Akhenaten - but where did he suddenly come from? Smenkhare disappeared, Akhenaten was replaced by Neferneferuaten - who may, or may not have been Nefertiti. Neferneferuaten then disappeared without trace and Akhenaten’s only known son, Tutankhaten, took the throne as a child.

Tutankhaten (mother unknown) restored the worship of the old gods, was renamed Tutankhamun and married his (half?) sister Ankhesenpaaten. He died  young with no surviving children. His widow, now known as Ankhesenamun might have written a series of letters to the king of the Hittites offering his son the throne of Egypt, the prince was murdered on his way to Egypt.

Instead, the throne passed to Ay, a commoner who first appeared in the reign of Akhenaten and went on to assume fabulous power and prestige. It has been suggested that he was actually the father of Nefertiti - but there’s nothing written literally in stone. In becoming pharaoh, Ay frustrated the likely line of succession which should have gone to a well-regarded general by the name of Horemheb. Ay might have married Ankhesenamun, but died without children and didn’t mention her once in his tomb.

At which point Horemheb assumes the throne and began the process of erasing everything that had happened from the accession of Akhenaten onwards - which is why we have so many gaps in our knowledge.

And like I said - this is the simple telling.

history,fd4ygtf,t1_fd4pb6x,1578172385.0,"If the Greek historian Strabo is to believed then a canal from the Delta region to the Bitter Lakes *may* have been started under the reign of Senusret III in the Twelfth Dynasty but there is no physical evidence or contemporaneous inscriptions that it ever existed, let alone was ever completed. Senusret did manage to build a canal bypassing the First Cataract of the Nile and was very careful to tell the world about his achievements; had he competed a link to the Red Sea, we’d know all about it.

It’s not clear if any canal was ever completed from the Nile to the Red Sea before the reign of Ptolemy II nearly 1600 years after Senusret. The Greek records also mention, but disagree about, Necho II (26th Dynasty) or Darius the Great (27th Dynasty) were the first to build a canal."
history,fd4j5o1,t3_ejxa69,1578167950.0,"There wasn’t really a trade route as such. The Egyptians didn’t appear to know much about the lands to the East of the Red Sea. Their focus was on land trade from the areas to the east of the Mediterranean as far as modern Turkey and Iran and trade from further up the Nile, a region they called Nubia. 

There was some ocean traffic to the coasts of modern day Israel, Lebanon,  Syria and Cyprus - but it was relatively minor in terms of the Egyptian economy - mainly for things the Egyptians didn’t have, such as large timbers which almost exclusively came from what is now Lebanon. This lack of timber to build ships has been suggested as one reason why the Egyptians didn’t become a seafaring society like the Phoenicians or Greeks. 

Another reason for the construction of the Suez Canal in the 19th Century was the massive and growing trade between European nations and their colonies in Asia. Cutting travel times and costs by bypassing the route around Africa was economically sensible - even though the British were loathe to allow a French company to build the canal."
history,fd4g2aw,t1_fd3vmqx,1578167170.0,"Yep - the Egyptians had a well-established route to the Red Sea through the Wadi Hammamat which runs easy from the Nile a little north of Thebes (modern Luxor) Valley. The route was safe since it was lined with watering holes and forts. 

A number of ports were built along the Red Sea Coast including at places now known as El Qoser and  Mersa Gawasis and was used to launch expeditions to a land called Punt whose exact location is still uncertain but might have been in the modern Horn of Africa. Punt was famed for its exotic spices and fragrances which were used in temple offerings. 

The famous 18th Dynasty pharaoh Hatshepsut devoted a large part of the decoration in her massive mortuary temple at Deir el Bahri to a successful expedition to Punt and the strange animals and people they met there including King Perahu and Queen Ati.

The route remained vital throughout pharaonic history since it was by far the shortest route to the coast from the Valley.

As an aside... As well as trade, Hammamat was mined for gold, basalt, schist and a super hard sandstone used for carvings; most notably an object called the Narmer Palette which dates back to the First Dynasty and commemorates the unification of Egypt under a single crown."

history,fcz1s6h,t1_fcydumz,1578091937.0,"The Weald, south-east of London was the centre of iron-age and Medieval English iron working. It was ideal since it was heavily forested which produced large amounts of timber suitable for charcoal burning. The woods in the area were heavily coppiced, but as you say, combined with the demand for timber for shipbuilding, there just weren’t enough trees to go round. The Weald was also geologically suitable as it contains Cretaceous clays which not only could be used for building furnaces, but which also contain bands of siderite iron stone. Siderite is iron carbonate (just under 50% iron by weight) and tends to be low in both sulfur and phosphorus both of which can weaken iron and steel. 

The location of the Weald, between London and the Channel ports also meant it was perfectly-located for trade and for importing technologies such as the blast furnace from mainland Europe. The Weald industry survived pretty much until the advent of coke-fired blast furnaces which were located around the coalfields of the Midlands and Scotland where high-grade haematite deposits were located under the Coal Measures themselves."

The Egyptians knew about the Minoans and called them keftiu. There was extensive trade between the two civilisations and Minoan wall paintings of bull leaping (or at least art heavily influenced by the Minoans) has been found at a location called Tell el-Daba (formerly the city of Avaris) in the Nile Delta. The paintings are located in a palace that has been dated to the mid-18th Dynasty, most probably to the reigns of either Hatshepsut or to Thutmose III. 

The Sea Peoples first appear in the Egyptian record about a century or more later in Year 2 of the reign of Ramesses II when he put down a seaborne invasion by a people the Egyptians called ‘Sherden’ who may have been Philistines. They then reappear around Year 5 of his successor Merneptah when they are called ‘The Nine Bows’ and involved forces from Libya as well as peoples from Canaan and the Hittite Empire. 

Finally, the main Sea People invasions began in Year 8 of the reign of Ramesses III where the main culprits may have been linked to the collapsing Hittite (the so-called Denyens), and Mycenaean civilisations (the Tjeker - which have variously, and controversially, been linked to both Crete and to Troy). These wars crippled Egypt’s economy and things weren’t helped by the murder of Ramesses III. From that moment on, Egypt was pretty much on a downward trajectory of decline overseen by a seemingly endless dreary succession of pharaohs called Ramesses."

worldnews,fcsmckt,t1_fcsd492,1577919611.0,"40 years was a conservative estimate of the lifetime for reactors - in the US there is plenty of pressure to certify existing PWRs for 60-80 years. The Russian VVER is already certified for 60 years. A lot more is known about the effects of radiation on reactor vessels than when they were built and it looks like they can run safely for longer than expected. The existing reactor fleet will probably deliver a nice profit for their owners if they can be run for their full lifetimes - but I suspect the plummeting price of renewables will mean many can’t dispatch power at competitive rates.

The only Western reactors that won’t get a significant lifetime extension are the UK’s fleet of graphite moderated AGRs which will be phased out from 2023. The fleet has already exceeded its original design lifetime, and will be shut down because of cracking in the graphite bricks which do not compromise safety, but which cannot be repaired.

Gamma rays are a form of light which we can’t see and which carry a huge amount of energy. Most gamma rays pass straight through he camera , but some will be absorbed by the atoms of the sensor itself. This delivers a huge amount of energy to the atoms which ‘excites’ the electrons in those atoms.the atom eventually loses that energy by spitting out a photon of light. It is this photon which is registered by the camera’s sensor.

If this is an image from photographic film, then radiation causes bright dots and fogging on film. Film is made of silver halide (chloride, iodide, bromide) salts in a plastic film. A photon of light causes a negative halide ion to lose an electron which is then gobbled up by the positive silver ion to produce opaque metallic silver - enough of them and you have an image. Alpha radiation (helium nuclei) and beta radiation (high-speed electrons) have enough energy to cause the same chemical reactions in film as light."
