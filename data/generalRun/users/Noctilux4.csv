""The most common type of medium-sized black holes is called ""stellar."" The mass of a stellar black hole can be up to 20 times greater than the mass of the sun and can fit inside a ball with a diameter of about 10 miles. Dozens of stellar mass black holes may exist within the Milky Way galaxy."" -NASA. 

I used 10 solar masses instead. 20 times the mass of our sun in a 10 mile diameter sphere, is the density. How are you confused about this? It's Astronomy 101."
