If you really want to open it, you can likely do it with a friction ball, or maybe a ball of duct tape like the other guy said, never tried that myself. If you decide to do that, be very careful to only open it in a clean, dust-free area. If you plan on getting it professionally serviced that's not such a big deal, but dust and dirt can wear down the components much worse than they normally would over time.

Also, I'd like to emphasize just how incredibly small the components are in there. I have just barely shaky hands, almost imperceivably so, and if I didn't have the patience of a saint I'd have probably thrown stuff across the room out of frustration after trying to get a screw back in place 100+ times until I got it just right, or incorrectly oiling a part just to have to clean it and try again dozens of times over.

Repairing it also won't be happening unless you plan on investing on some tools which can get pretty expensive.

All that said, I don't mean to discourage you. Watches aren't incredibly complex once you get in there and see how it works, they are incredibly precise and small though. Repairing them is a super rewarding hobby, if not monetarily then personally. If you've got the patience and aptitude then by all means take a crack at it. I'd recommend watching the videos on Watch Repair Channel on YouTube to get an idea of what it's like and what's required. If you enjoy doing it, you can start building your own custom watches. Also, you can get a good book about watch repair, I started with ""Watch Repairing as a Hobby: An Essential Guide for Non-Professionals"" by D.W. Fletcher."

Since it appears that everything is working ""after"" the balance, I'd say it's very likely the gear train is working fine.

Considering you said you think you may have overwound it, I'd imagine the problem lies in the mainspring, which will mean a full disassembly, mainspring replacement, cleaning, oiling, and reassembly. You can try talking to a watchmaker somewhere near you, but I imagine the cost is going to come close to half what you paid for it new, if not more. I saw you didn't have a local watchmaker, but if you can find one in a large city near-ish to you you can probably either drop it off or mail it in to them for service if you're willing to go that route."

politics,fekym21,t1_fekm9h1,1579210304.0,"If we did senators more fairly I'd have less of a problem with them. As it stands now, a majority party of the state often gets both senators, even if they only get 51% of the vote. It would be far more fair to have a majority/minority senator based on some percentage of the vote. Alternative voting methods like ranked choice would be an obvious solution here, but that would also require both senate seats to come up for a vote at the same time.

The way the founders originally intended it, that the state legislature choose their senators, is still a better option than what we have now, though gerrymandering would still affect it pretty heavily so I'd still rather it be up to an alternative voting method.

All in all though, it still creates a very large power disparity. The senators from Wyoming have the same amount of power as the senators from California, essentially giving each Wyoming resident the same power as 68 California residents. That's the most extreme example, obviously, but there's no way anyone can look at that and say it's fair, especially when the simple majority of a state gets both senators. We can mitigate the unfairness of the Senate, but it will never be truly fair. I don't believe it was ever really meant to be fair though.

Of course there's plenty of unfairness in the system, like the electoral college allowing winner-takes-all, electors and house seats not changing to be proportional to population state to state, the two-party system in general, etc. There's a lot to fix if we intend this country to even be *remotely* fair, and with all the other systems having been eroded from their original intentions (proportional representation based on population) I'd say the argument that the founders wanted the Senate to be 2 per state no matter what is kind of moot."

In other words, I literally know IFF *inside and out down to a component level,* including how it interacts with other systems onboard.

What happened here was not some coordinated effort to get Iran to shoot down a plane marked as an enemy aircraft as you're suggesting. Almost every weapons system in the world that utilizes IFF has *at least* one firing mode that is set to ignore IFF or at least not warn the user of IFF mismatches. These modes are used when a military unit is expecting an imminent attack, like Iran's SAM operators would have been at the time.

As far as spoofing IFF is concerned, yes it is technically possible, though not in the way you're describing as that would be an absolutely insane undertaking. In the US Military IFF codes are loaded manually, meaning they are loaded via a very controlled, offline, dual control procedure by only trusted individuals with appropriate levels of security clearance, and those codes expire within a very short period of time at which point nee ones must be loaded. Spoofing IFF does happen, but not in the way you're describing. It's feasible for an IFF transponder to impersonate an enemy *willingly*, but it is an insanely unfeasible goal to load IFF codes onto an enemy's IFF transponder.

US military IFF systems are literally classified top secret, so what I should talk about on the subject is extremely limited, but suffice it to say that you're talking out of your ass here."

p'(h) = 62.4 pcf per foot.

If one starts at a depth of 15 feet below the surface of the water, how many feet deeper must one dive for the water pressure to increase by 800 pcf? Round your answer to the nearest foot."

educationalgifs,fcwp50e,t1_fcwn3w7,1578032287.0,"It absolutely is intuitive. I never learned what I had basically figured out on my own even had a name until later in my life. I have been able to clear my mind since I was very young, I didn't really get good at it until I was in my early 20s though. When I was 24 I met a few people who were super into spirituality who told me all about meditation and the benefits, etc. I told them I don't really need to do that because my mind is under control, and of course they didn't believe me, I was too young for that clearly. I didn't learn until then that a lot of people don't really have a handle on their minds. But this is something I've been at least haphazardly doing since I was a child, I just didn't realize it wasn't something that everyone did. I honestly thought it was normal. So of course I go to my friends of the time and recount stuff like ""man, this old hippie thinks that being able to blank out your thoughts is something you have to work for, it's not *that* hard haha"" and they look at me like I'm crazy. Apparently it's not common hut realizing your thoughts are under your own control is definitely something you can realize on your own."
educationalgifs,fcwoecv,t1_fcwmh8c,1578031552.0,"The thoughts aren't sentient, they're nothing but a product of your subconscious. They have as much power over you as a bad dream, which is to say they have none. You are not obligated to entertain those thoughts any more than you are obligated to carry out the vague remembrance of a dream.

Your consciousness is a river and you are just floating along in it. Usually it is calm, sometimes it is turbulent, but either way there are obstacles that you must avoid, and how you deal with them is something that no one can really tell you how to do beyond figuring it out for yourself. Others can offer advice on *how* to figure it out, but your method is your own.

Ultimately you can deal with that river 2 ways: fight against each obstacle that comes your way and hopefully avoid them all, or flow with the ricer and let the currents take control. The latter is what meditation is like, except instead of sinply allowing the currents to carry you, you become the current."

educationalgifs,fcwc2ci,t1_fcwb8ii,1578021936.0,"That's exactly how it works. Like, by definition. There are millions of things we passively perceive and do not think about every day. Do you have a thought about everything in your field of vision? You still see all of those things, but perhaps don't focus on them and form a thought about them. You notice them, you become aware of them, but you don't think about them. You are aware of things in the room with you, even if you don't think about them. If something went missing you would think ""where'd that go?"" If you weren't aware of things and notice them without thought then you wouldn't have any object permanence. You don't have to think about the lamp behind you constantly in order to notice it no longer being there, so why would you need thought to notice that it was?"
educationalgifs,fcwb4mt,t1_fcw9kxb,1578021323.0,"Perception is not thought. It is perception. Your senses themselves do not constitute thought. Thought is ideas, opinions, focus. Perception does not require thought, and thought does not require perception. You can perceive something without forming thoughts on it. Once you form that opinion in your head of ""that feels good"" you've thought about it."

Unless that was meant as a dig towards men in general, in which case you should try meditation."
educationalgifs,fcw9ikw,t1_fcw8iav,1578020248.0,"Thinking about it would be a conscious thought, like if something feels good you think to yourself ""that feels good."" If there is no conscious thought to go along with a feeling then it is just a feeling, not a thought. The two things are separate, and you don't have to think about something to feel it."

I would sometimes worry that in an impaired state I might not always think that about them. So I tried stopping them the only way I knew how, blanking them out. Eventually they stopped happening altogether, but I'm told that's typically not an effective way of dealing with them and it usually makes them worse."
educationalgifs,fcw8f5y,t1_fcw6u7z,1578019514.0,"I mean, if you count subconscious processes as thinking then sure, I never stop thinking. If I want though I can have no conscious thoughts. I don't have to think about if something feels nice to simply feel it. It never has to become a thought."
