I asked the people there every time, and genuinly tried to get what he asked for.  Turns out I never got the cut he wanted. After like the fourth time I fucked up I was fired from buying meat. That might be an option, of you don't want to buy it just get the wrong one a few times."
AskReddit,ffay1j7,t3_eskc2n,1579747135.0,"So, this is a joke question with mostly joke answers. I am married to a man who added up his time to be over a year on wow, he was morbidly obese, and a virgin. He realized he wasn't doing himself any favors, he began learning to cook and not eating out. He started working out, and began getting out more, learned to listen and talk to women. When I met him he'd lost 100 lbs, showered everyday, and had signed off of gaming. If you don't care about yourself, no one else will either. Giving up 1-2 hours if gaming will make a huge difference."

bestof,fei6bko,t3_ep52lc,1579131247.0,"Honestly this is a conversation they need to have. A wedding is a big day, and she wants to look nice in photos she will have for life. Wedding planning can be super stressful, but one way to make a marriage last is to be able to talk about it. $950 is a very reasonable cost. There are some very nice ones for less, websites that sell used dresses, or discount stores. Wish is not one, quality is questionable at best, and they steal from designers. If the $100 dress comes in and it's no good you're out $100 and have to rush order which will cost more. Idk, this just seems like a chat every couple should have."
