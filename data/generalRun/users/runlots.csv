I know you believe it. I know it will take time to undo, but we both know that it's not true, and it's not useful either. You have value no matter how many friends or dates you have.

bipolar,ffpvema,t1_ffpl9pp,1580107186.0,"I feel this. I described it as sawing off the most important part of myself. I went off after Christmas and I like myself again after 2019, my year on olanzapine that resulted in constant depression. It does eliminate mania, so at least it did something, but it was not a life that met my quality standards. I acknowledge that no meds isn't necessarily the best option for me - my soulmate cocktail might be out there somewhere - but I like it right now and I have a good support network looking out for me. If they say it's time to try something again, I will."
bipolar,ffptvvb,t1_ffpqvj4,1580105529.0,"Oh, what I'm suggesting is NOT easy at all. Sorry if I made it seem that way. You are completely right in wanting and needing a partner who is equal participant. What I'll suggest is being firm that you need her to experiment. Try seeing a professional and/or support group for a defined period of time to see if she might find it helpful. Personally, I struggle to believe or internalize anything that I didn't help discover myself. I'm very resistant to things that are just told to me. Therapy is an assisted journey. A personal trainer for your brain. You do the heavy lifting, and the counselor coaches you how to do it intelligently. Without one, it's chaos and strings of unforced errors. You know, you're living it. If she refuses to try it, maybe you decide that's a dealbreaker for you. And if one therapist doesn't click with her, it's not time to quit; it's okay and normal to try another. Maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but I believe that you can fight bipolar with one of medication or therapy, or both. I'm biased towards therapy. But I know for certain that you cannot choose neither. Neither is pure suffering for everyone involved.

On self destruction - yes, intervene, but carefully. When I am self destructing the first thing my girlfriend does is ask when my next counselling session is and we decide whether I need to book one sooner. I actually had a down day today. I skipped work and didn't eat until night. We weren't going to see each other for a few days because schedules but she suggested that we make time to get together tomorrow and go for a walk in the park. I appreciate it and feel loved and don't feel like she's nagging or overstepping any boundaries. It also helps that she knows my love language is quality time, and she actively practises it. Hope this was useful

Edit: just skimmed your original post again and refreshed that she has tried therapy and medication before, but right now one of the issues is cost of treatment. So some of what I said was less applicable but I'll leave it as is. It's late! Brain fart"

bipolar,ffpqe0x,t3_euilzx,1580102064.0,"I struggle with this. Sometimes I wish I'd never been born. That's a lot cleaner than being alive and then dying, but it's also completely hypothetical, so not very practical. My weird take is this: I wasn't alive for the enormous chunk of time that the universe has existed, and it will exist for another unimaginable amount of time after I'm dead. Living a life is the longest thing we will ever do, but it's still nothing on a cosmic scale. Might as well live it out and see what's here. Maybe become a hedonist. Who knows! Who cares? My sentimental take is to do things that align with your values and make your loved ones happy. It feels good to spread happiness to strangers too. Do that, live a reasonable life, and hope that when you're dead and someone mentions you, a man raises a beer and says ""Oh, Jonathan? What a great fucking guy. Cheers!"""

bipolar,ffpntnp,t3_eug8cg,1580099808.0,"Caffeine is dangerous. I keep caffeine free herbal teas in the house, and treat drinking coffee like I treat alcohol. I don't think I want to abstain from it entirely but I know I'd be pretty messed up if I was dependent on it, riding the high, crash and craving of it every day."
bipolar,ffpmvnl,t1_ffpit8g,1580099045.0,"CBT is neither optimistic or pessimistic. That would be like accusing your ears of having a political bias. It's simply listening without judgement, then examining whether specific thoughts are true, and how they impact your emotions and behaviours. The twist that my current therapist puts on it is asking whether the thought is true, or if it's useful. Often faulty thoughts are neither, so we need to be able to identify and stand up to them. 

Next: what I'm hearing is that you're trying hard to help her, which is great, but the tough thing about it is that your role is as her partner, not as her mental health professional. It's difficult to give the help needed from this role because no matter your gender or how good your intentions are, you get perceived as a mansplainer, or a nag, or someone looking to renovate a fixer-upper. I have dated two women who happened to be social workers and as helpful as they have been, their relationship to me demanded separation of church and state. You cannot be both fixer and lover to a person. You can be supportive though. This means listening, and building her up, but not offering solutions unless you're asked for them specifically. It can be hard not to but sadly it is not very helpful. Being supportive also means communicating in her preferred love languages. If you're unfamiliar with them, look up John Gottman and the 5 love languages. This might mean cooking her a nice meal, or planning a nice date together. That's your comparative advantage, that you can do for her better than anyone else can. A healer shouldn't be rushing into attack - a healer should be performing the role that he's designed best to do. Healing!"
bipolar,ffpekpx,t1_ffpdnyh,1580093096.0,It takes time to dismantle beliefs like this. I think it took 10 years of dysfunction and counselling to finally believe I was good enough for my parents lol
bipolar,ffpdpgx,t3_eugyns,1580092472.0,"I don't think the professional she sees necessarily needs to be a psychologist. I've had some great counselors whose backgrounds have been in social work. Look for someone who does cognitive behavioural therapy. CBT trains you to notice and challenge thoughts that contribute to the extremes of this mood disorder. It also is supported by research as one of the best approaches to manage it. So that's a good place to start. Use a mood tracker - I personally use eMoods. It's very easy to lose yourself in moods if you're not checking in on yourself daily. Another thing that has been useful for me is support groups. My counselor found a bipolar support group in my area and I have been attending weekly, for free, ever since. It has helped me feel less alone in this struggle and given me hope that I might be able to live well with bipolar. Once you get through the CBT material my one on one counselling sessions have become more support than teaching, and while I still get a lot out of going to counselling, support group is really good at support. And free is a lot cheaper than expensive. So if you don't end up finding a place that takes health insurance, I would still recommend paying full price for someone to at least get her through CBT sessions. At best, it's powerful enough to change the trajectory of her life, and at worst, it's just another tool to use to fight back. Good luck and thanks for being a good supportive boyfriend to write out your post. A strong support network is key to fighting this, and you're definitely doing your part."
bipolar,ffnz5vl,t3_eu5eq0,1580072518.0,"Um, excuse me? Someone who says things like that that is no angel, no matter what goody things they do in their spare time. What a bitch!

Congratulations on your employment record, that is seriously impressive. Since diagnosis my employment history has been measured in months, not years. You can do this."
bipolar,ffnso59,t3_eua71w,1580070264.0,"I've never smoked and I still got it. I definitely understand the thoughts searching for a cause though. We always seem to want a reason for things, but sometimes you don't get an explanation. It's something I've personally wondered a lot about. I've had a lot of brain issues in my life (concussions, cracked my head open as a toddler, brain tumour as an infant) so that's generally where my thoughts have gone at night. But I also found out a few days ago that my great uncle was hospitalized for something mental health related many years ago, and bipolar does have a genetic link, so maybe that's my answer? Unfortunately it's going to be hard to learn the details - he's dead and my family is very secretive about all health issues. Like for example I didn't know my grandma had and beat breast cancer until this past year. Who hides breast cancer?! My family, apparently. I'm not much better though - only my immediate family knows I have bipolar 2 and I'm scared to come out to the rest of the family, so I'm also a part of the problem. 
Well, this turned out to have very little to do with marijuana. I hope you got something out of it. Thanks for reading!"
relationships,ffnd275,t3_eu49hb,1580064474.0,"Do you ever go to a movie and afterwards just feel so sad and mute? Regardless of genre. Especially if it's a matinee and you leave the theatre and it's light outside and the feeling hits you. For me the only response is to reset myself by going to bed. Night movies are the only way.

What to talk about: sometimes nothing is perfect! When I'm feeling this way I just say something like ""I really appreciate how we can enjoy each other's company without feeling we need to fill every moment with chatter."" I read with my girlfriend all the time and it's way better than reading alone. You have to talk sometimes though, so here's a few goldmines:
1) Share embarrassing and awkward experiences. This can be scary for a lot of people but it's amazing how powerful exposing yourself and being vulnerable is for creating strong bonds. Usually others reciprocate too so you're going to hear some incredible shit. Highly recommend.
2) Ask weird hypotheticals. Would you rather types of things. Some people have no patience for this but it can lead to interesting conversations and understanding different perspectives.
3) Create shared experiences together and later have ""Remember that time we went _____ and _____ happened?"" conversations. I've been with my girlfriend for 4 years so we have a lot of these. You forget a surprising amount of good things and it's always nice to reminisce on them.
4) Ask her more about herself! I assume you haven't been together long so there's a lot you don't know about her. You're dating her, so you should be curious. Childhood, family, good and bad school experiences, dreams for the future, things she finds irresistibly attractive, political and religious beliefs. There are so many subjects that are now open to you because you share this intimate relationship. Ask away! Most people like talking about themselves, and while she's talking, your only job is to listen. Enjoy"

bipolar,ff70r2q,t3_erzt9q,1579638816.0,"What doesn't work: lay in bed on my phone until people start wondering where I am and then I might show up late. I haven't found much success with this, but it has happened many times so I think it deserves to be said. 
What I am supposed to do: follow the basic action plan. Number one on the list is usually make a cup of tea, or coffee. It's easy, satisfying and gets you moving. Next on the list is to commit to going out for a walk for 10 minutes. This does a few things. 1. Sunlight. It helps! 2. Movement. Any exercise is better than no exercise. 3. You might enjoy it and decide since you're already out and doing okay, you can stay out for longer. If you're interested in running, the same concept applies. Sometimes you just need help to get out the door and you're fine. If not, you're always allowed to come back in after 10 minutes. 4. You might see a dog or maybe even a cat. So nice! 5. If you haven't showered for days and feel self conscious about how you smell and look, the prospect of going outside might compel you to shower first. Two birds with one stone. If not, no big deal, nobody is going to care or say anything. What's important is having a task to accomplish that will feel good while you're doing it and you can strike off the list once you get home.
If this just isn't your day and you can't handle any more, you can go back to bed. But when I do this, that rarely happens. It changes the trajectory of my day. You can also mix in other chores and incentives to your taste. Dishes to do? Laundry? Start doing it, and then give yourself little rewards for making progress. Play videogames for a bit. Enjoy a small snack. Whatever works for you! We can manage this illness and live fulfilling lives. Sometimes you just need a plan to help make it happen."

They weren't reasonable - they were relentless - and I believe they came from the drug. I stopped taking Latuda after 2 weeks of this hell (this started after I was on it for a month) and booked an appointment with my doctor for new meds. The thoughts stopped immediately.

I've lowered my expectations for myself dramatically and it seems to have helped. My original life plan was to start my own business to solve the world's problems while being this incredible pillar of the local community but I don't think that's realistic at this time.

Another thing - I used to have a job delivering the mail and it was a pretty decent work if that's something that interests you.

You definitely should not model for him if you don't feel comfortable. Your body choice trumps any disappointment he may feel. Do not allow him to pressure you into something you are not ready to do.

On the other hand, modeling might be an activity that could help build up confidence in your body. You say you have no stand out features. I don't believe that. He's dating you for many reasons. Ask him, he should be able to tell you what those are. And if he's as talented at photography as you say he is, he might give you a glimpse of what he sees when he looks at you.
