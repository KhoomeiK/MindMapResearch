>After being in the room a bit and meeting her the question inevitably comes up of how we came up with her name.

Info:

Who asked? 

Because if it was your mother, you know she knows who the baby's named after, and the question was a set-up. 

You don't actually have to answer her questions, or mine, but how was her relationship with your father's mother? Are they close? Have you a good relationship with your grandparents? It's important to think about context as to how you deal. Did she want to be the center of attention there too?

But if I'm right and your mother asked the question, it's up to you to keep that from your wife and kids. There's lots of ways, and it's best to try to and think about it like this: a child is like a pebble dropped into a family. That pebble makes ripples  and the ripples are the circles of importance and need. Baby in the middle, parents in the next row, aunts, uncles, grandparents following down the generations. 

Keeping it simple, sometimes the transition from inner circle to outer circle is very traumatic, but that doesn't mean you can stay. Some people push back, some run away, some scream and carry on, and most stay in their lane and are helpful support. 

You have a screamer. An attention hog. Someone who sounds like she resents being pushed out of the middle, let alone the inner circle. She wants to make sure all eyes are on her, always. You can't fix that, but you can do everything you can to minimize the impact on your family. I implore you (and your wife) to get therapy to help you work out a strategy for containment and control. It's much better to frustrate them into avoiding you, rather than you being forced to fight to the death of the relationship.
