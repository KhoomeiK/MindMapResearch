nursing,ff8v2mm,t3_es8uam,1579697086.0,Take some time off. You need to even if you think you don’t.
Endo,ff8u2ud,t1_ff4jgyy,1579696106.0,"Actually yeah I did have 1 private consult - he was the one to refer me to the public. (Sorry I had forgotten about that) I remember I had to do that so I would have a proper detailed cat 1 referral to public. From memory (2017) it was about $120 I think. He didn’t really do anything or suggest treatment, he just wanted me on the public list in case I needed surgery. So got referred to the royal women’s hospital gynae clinic. The surgeon I saw there was great but unfortunately he moved back to Israel :(. Anyways I got my appointment in maybe 2-3 weeks and had surgery maybe 2-3 weeks after that. I’d suggest the royal women’s who have 3 endometriosis specialist surgeons who have completed RANZCOG/AGES Level 6 Which is an official training (highest level) in laparoscopic excision of grade 4 endo. So there is definitely some seriously good surgeons there. Good luck and feel free to ask if you need any help!!"

nursing,ff38cim,t1_ff37efg,1579536090.0,Whoa I’ve never heard of or seen that. Sounds horrible. Is that classified as mechanical restraint? Nothing like that exists in Australia where I’ve worked. Which country is this? That’s insane.
Endo,ff37sng,t3_erediu,1579535722.0,"I had my consults and surgeries/inpatient stays with no insurance and had zero out of pocket fees. Just in case you weren’t aware this is free, but you probably are if you’re an Aussie."

endometriosis,fer222m,t3_eq3b9q,1579348709.0,"I’m so sorry that you had that experience. We all know too well how difficult it is when people underplay your day suffering. 
I’m not sure why this is such a common thing amongst people with endo, but it’s surely contributed by the fact that they actually don’t know truly what we are experiencing. 

Feel free to reach out if you need some moral support. Remember your reddit endo friends will always have a listening ear so to speak. 

Oh and I hope your endo belly has gone down a little, or that your doing okay."

I was semi laying down trying to wash under my car, lots of mud on the gearbox, noticed big lumps of mud on my driveway, so I unintelligently tried to spray them downhill whilst still laying down (instead of just waiting till I was up and finished), kinda aimed in a sweeping motion towards my feet but was all kinda sqwishy underneath my car so held the gun kinda awkwardly and managed to spray my leg.
