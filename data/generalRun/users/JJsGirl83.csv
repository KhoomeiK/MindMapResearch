Your ex ""friends"" were acting like immature little boys and blaming you for being annoyed with them is childish."
Marriage,ffy3i0f,t3_evrohb,1580337847.0,It honestly wouldn't bother me as I trust my husband and knows he's not going to cheat just because his moronic friend does. I'd be wondering why he is still friends with this guy though.
AmItheAsshole,ffw0y59,t3_ev9vkc,1580279786.0,"NTA

I think you did the right thing with Ethan and he even admitted to you that he didn't like lying to Jess or Cindy."
rant,ffw0spc,t3_evek75,1580279623.0,"As a straight person, I've only been to Pride a couple of times and I didn't see anything overly sexual there.

However I do agree that the sexual stuff should be kept away from children. In my city it's much harder to avoid the Pride parade and the stuff afterwards as an adult as it's held in a public space where anybody can go."

We had friends tell us that she was pregnant at our wedding and I was thrilled for them. Mind you the big difference was they didn't make a big announcement to everybody, they pulled my husband and I aside to have a quiet chat about it and then we went back to dancing."
childfree,ffvzase,t3_evdf7g,1580278077.0,"No but I'm always glad it's not me in their situation. Even if it's someone who wants a child, I still feel sorry for them because of how limiting pregnancy and children can be. I wouldn't ever trade my freedom for that."
relationship_advice,fft7lp4,t3_euwtcn,1580211095.0,"Wow, so it sounds like his proposal has nothing to do with his feelings for you and everything to do with getting back at his sister for ruining his graduation. If I were you, I would call off the engagement and potentially dump him."
AmItheAsshole,ffrirc4,t3_eusi69,1580158833.0,INFO: How did you have access to her venmo account? Did she bring that up willingly or not?
childfree,ffrigj0,t3_eust3a,1580158651.0,"Nope, I have a crush on a guy with a dad bod."
Marriage,ffr7o2a,t3_eush58,1580152237.0,I would still consider that cheating as you're not properly divorced yet.
AmItheAsshole,ffr4yct,t1_ffr4vgu,1580150553.0,Sorry but you should have reported him long before now.
AmItheAsshole,ffr4qab,t3_euq68g,1580150415.0,INFO: Why didn't you report him for this before? You knew he was recording these women in sexual situations without their consent.
unpopularopinion,ffr4j5f,t1_ffr1l4o,1580150293.0,"Mine are not enhanced at all, they're just naturally large because all of the women on my mum's side of the family have naturally large boobs. I'd trade them for a B cup if I could but can't afford the surgery."
prochoice,ffr402e,t1_fds60fn,1580149965.0,"Nope I consent only to sex not to the pregnancy. 

There is nothing you can do if I could get pregnant and didn't want to be. You have zero say in that."
prochoice,ffr3h35,t3_etj5if,1580149636.0,I'm also an atheist and pro choice so can't really give you a religious viewpoint on this.
AskReddit,ffr2pz9,t3_epyrmi,1580149167.0,Never learned and don't see the point when I live about 100 yards from public transport and there's no place to park the car nearby.
childlessbychoice,ffr0e0j,t3_eun9xn,1580147694.0,I love them as long as they're not my child and I'm not responsible for them 24/7/365
rant,ffr07a6,t1_ffqw2p3,1580147578.0,You're correct in that me having an abortion is none for your business. Nor is it any of the business of female strangers on the internet.
AmItheAsshole,ffpyftc,t3_euf69e,1580110913.0,"NAH

You are certainly not obligated to tell them and as you said, you already gave them a wedding gift. Keep it private and enjoy your winnings!"
relationship_advice,ffpybm0,t3_eui1nr,1580110759.0,"My husband was unemployed for a while in the past and we did have small disagreements during that time but I knew he was actively looking for a new job and I know that he would never slap me during a disagreement. 

Dump her and if you're living together, get her to move out as well."
crazyexgirlfriend,ffojbia,t1_ffohq7v,1580078274.0,I know right? I can't explain it
relationship_advice,ffoj8z6,t3_eubv14,1580078249.0,"Nah, ditch the jerk. Not only for your differing views on abortion but because he made fun of you for your opinion on it."
unpopularopinion,ffoik75,t3_eu6t8u,1580077987.0,"So scroll past those posts or block the person if you find it that offensive. Personally I don't care enough to be bothered if they post that on social media. Hell, I saw my sister in law breastfeed both her kids in public before and couldn't care less."
atheism,ffogvc9,t3_euarb8,1580077506.0,"Nah, I don't buy her claim it was a metaphor."
relationship_advice,ffnp0zb,t3_euazuj,1580068785.0,"Thank you for telling him, you're allowed him to knowingly make a decision about whether to stay with her or not with all of the facts rather than only some of them."
aww,ffnothv,t3_eu830c,1580068700.0,"Nah, she is way cuter than babies"
prochoice,ffnol65,t1_ffnnu5b,1580068604.0,"A lot of the ""pro life"" people I've come across would be quite happy to force women to stay pregnant under every circumstance. So yeah that's pro birth rather than pro life in my view."
relationship_advice,ffnoetf,t3_eu4qv9,1580068533.0,"OK, I have edited my post to say unhealthy interest instead"
relationship_advice,ffnlcsm,t1_ffnl2ee,1580067529.0,"Ok, how about ""unhealthy"" in this case?"
crazyexgirlfriend,ffmsg9h,t3_eu706s,1580058406.0,I kinda miss Trent LOL
UnsentLetters,ffm9ewo,t1_ffm96zg,1580050919.0,That is so sweet and lovely. Thank you for providing me with a different point of view on this.
AmItheAsshole,ffm7pq1,t1_ffk0704,1580049937.0,"NAH

I have two half brothers but I never call them that as it makes zero different to me. I also grew up with them around a lot so I see no reason to call them anything other than my brothers."

Would he be saying the same thing if you were using an inhaler or breastfeeding for example? If he would, then I say have a chat with him and if he says he would, I think you need to re-think your relationship with him."
AmItheAsshole,ffm6zbu,t3_etslki,1580049623.0,"NTA

My husband and I have been together for 7 years and I still don't know any of his passwords nor does he know any of mine. My accounts are mine and mine alone so I decide who has access to them other than me. That includes my bank account which like yours is linked to other stuff.

And just because she claims that all her friends have their SO's passwords doesn't mean you have to share yours."
aww,ffm680k,t3_eu2cgn,1580049231.0,Her niece is a little angel but this poor horse sounds totally neglected and I'm glad to hear you were going to report it to the authorities.
prochoice,ffm5wx3,t3_eu0mnc,1580049082.0,Typical words from someone who will never be pregnant in the first place. And I agree with her calling him pro birth instead of pro life. They don't care about the lives after the birth.
relationship_advice,ffm5oce,t3_eu4ywl,1580048893.0,I've never googled any of those things so I think it's highly unlikely he was looking up that stuff for any other reason other than cheating while he was there.
relationship_advice,ffm3v45,t3_eu4qv9,1580048000.0,"Your boyfriend's relationship with her is strained because of her and her frankly overly unhealthy interest in her son's sex life. 

It does sound like he is trying to do the right thing by pointing out that she is being invasive and inappropriate, particularly the time she did it in front of other family members."
