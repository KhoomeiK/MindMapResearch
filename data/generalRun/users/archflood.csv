patientgamers,ffejpnx,t1_ffej7j9,1579850839.0,"Cool thanks for the info, that kind of got me excited for Ninja Gaiden black again. That game has always looked good compared to other games of that generation, which are typically low detail polygons and murky textures. I am looking forward to the 4k look

I mean dark souls is great and all and I am loving it, but Ninja Gaiden does have that special feel, how smooth and fast it is, just feel so badass especially when up against loads of enemies"
patientgamers,ffej15c,t1_ffeiak3,1579850006.0,"I didn't know about the backward compatibility for ninja gaiden, might be a good excuse to get a Xbox once the new one (Scarlett?) comes out.

I briefly thought about getting PS3 + NG sigma back then, but didn't have much PS3 games I like so forgot about it

So it has to be the Xbox one X? The XB One S wouldn't work?"
patientgamers,ffeh7sw,t3_et4xjm,1579847892.0,"It's awesome I still have my Xbox original because of that. Love every bit except the piranha and the swimming stage

Ninja Gaiden 2 could not enjoy as much personally because the camera is somehow worse, zoomed in way to close"
misophonia,ffah7c3,t1_ffaeybj,1579735662.0,Yes I would be interested to know what the treatment is as well
gamingsuggestions,ff9pe0h,t3_ese29j,1579717951.0,"Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor does, where the enemies have their own rank structure. You can also mind control someone in their ranks, and eliminate their competitors to let your spy get promoted. If you get killed by whoever, they would actually gain rank and have more bodyguards etc so next time you go after them will be harder.

The world is kind of static though, not much NPCs"
gamingsuggestions,ff9oi8g,t1_ff9ieyz,1579717312.0,"In XCOM if someone in your squad is critically wounded (need to be stabilized by medic but survive the mission), their mental fortitude?? stat will have a permanent drop and will panic a lot easier in future battle."
kingdomcome,ff9nvmk,t3_esawwm,1579716917.0,"I love how Brother Nicodemus just kept being passive aggressive the entire night instead of telling you to get out

And the whole time I thought it was because of Mutt constantly barking outside"
squash,ff9ncsj,t3_esfipe,1579716609.0,"I have not worn Salming Kobra before but here's my input for Asics Gel. I usually wear Gel Rocket, but do notice that the gel cushioning would break down after about half a year of playing. Instead of feeling firm, the cushioning becomes mushy. Wasn't a lemon because I play my forehand open stance, and all my right shoes cushioning always goes mushy first while the left shoe is still ok.

I weight more than a good fit squash player so take that for what it's worth.

That said, I use Gel Rockets because they are good, available everywhere and cheap, and my shoes tend to wear out first from left foot toe drag after a few months and I can't afford buying high end shoes a few times a year"
introvert,ff9cw35,t3_escvg7,1579710184.0,"I do. Every weeknight after work, dinner, family time, and putting the kids to bed, it would be past 10 and I should be going to be bed to wake up 5:30 next morning. But if I just do that I will be very cranky after a couple days.

For some reason I could play video games (alone) for a few hours and cheat on sleep and feel better the next morning. Only works for one, two nights max though, before the lack of sleep catches up to me again, so it's always a great balancing act for me"
