Also please get help. Find a psychologist, find one that’s covered by your health insurance, get a referral to see one that’s beyond your insurance if you find one that you enjoyed. I did that, I have had 2 major incidents. My current psychologist is an absolute geek. He and I spend 1/2 the time geeking out about shit. But more importantly there’s an openness to talk about the harder issues too should they ever arise again. I had a referral since I didn’t like my insurance covered psychologist location (50 minute drive). When my insurance asked me why I requested a referral “because I attempted suicide” the lady quickly got things going paperwork wise. I don’t pay a cent. So I see him every week (15 minute drive, so no excuses), regardless of how I’m feeling. It’s a positive routine, a good habit.
