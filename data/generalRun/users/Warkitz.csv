drywall,fefy40d,t3_eos4g7,1579069109.0,"Scrape off anything loose. Cut the caulk out completely. Patch the hole with fast set drywall compound. This part is the tricky part. DAP makes a product for tubs/showers called 3.0. It is a spirits based caulk and doesn't clean up with water only mineral spirits or thinner. This stinks and can be hazardous to breath in. So we put mineral spirits in a cheap spray bottle. We put our bead of caulk along the joint where the tub meets the drywall. Then we spray the mineral spirits on the bead of caulk. This makes it so the bead wont stick anywhere the spirits lands making it easier to work with. Then smooth with you finger and wipe excess on to a cloth with spirits on it. That's the best sealing caulk I've found for this stuff and it dries fast enough that you can use the shower within a few hours. I would also paint the walls with an exterior paint.

That is the cheapest fix."

drywall,fdu3rdt,t3_en2007,1578727015.0,You're using plaster? is the rest of you house plaster? Plaster isn't joint compound or a patcher for drywall.

A sanding sponge can we rinsed or banged out. Sounds like you really fucked this up. good luck.

I cope with all the things we're not supposed to cope with, but I've also become more and more secluded. I've stopped working(I own my own business so not like anyone can fire me). Everyone just assumes I'm lazy. My mom always calls me lazy. My dad's been telling people in town that I've ""been in a pissy mood"" due to some issues with clients. I think its a triumph that I'm still alive, and haven't made any relationship ending or life altering catastrophes and every minute of every day feels like a struggle. But I'm a giant lazy piece of shit because I can speak very calmly and be present in conversations and act fine to everyone else.

It's similar to closet junkies. When things are going good for junkies they look like everyone else. Happy, funny, successful, etc. We don't recognize them as junkies until they're plummeting toward rock bottom. Just because we look like everyone else doesn't mean there isn't a problem. Makes understanding mental illness hard for people that don't struggle.
