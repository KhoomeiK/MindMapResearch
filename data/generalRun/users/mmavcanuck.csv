It seems like common sense that it’s cheaper to execute someone than to house, feed and take care of them for the rest of their natural life. But there are a lot of unavoidable costs that make a death sentence far more expensive than a sentence of life without parole.
Most of these costs result from the unique status of the death penalty within the US justice system. Because it’s the only truly irreversible form of punishment, the Constitution requires a long and complex judicial process for capital cases, including several levels of mandatory review after a death sentence is issued. The appeals process takes decades to complete.
Studies of the California death penalty system, the largest in the US, have revealed that a death sentence costs at least 18 times as much as a sentence of life without parole would cost.

https://deathpenalty.org/facts/5-myths-death-penalty/


>	A 2011 study by Ninth Circuit Judge Arthur L. Alarcon and Loyola Law School professor Paula M. Mitchell calculated that California taxpayers have spent more than $4 billion since capital punishment was reinstated in 1978, and estimate the annual cost of pursuing executions to be $184 million more than pursuing life without parole. Since then the expenses have only grown, and total cost estimates now exceed $5 billion since 1978."
todayilearned,fe65msw,t1_fe65619,1578882328.0,A death sentence costs like 20 times more than a life sentence.

Hereâ€™s the direct quote


the point is moot, as I wouldnâ€™t say yes to finishing ASOIAF, if asked. (And I donâ€™t think theyâ€™d ask me.) Iâ€™d respectfully decline. I wouldnâ€™t be right for the job for many reasons. I wouldnâ€™t want to put in the content that the series has, and part of that is due to my religious faith, part of it is just who I am. I donâ€™t shy away from difficult material, but I prefer not to get explicit."

It seems like common sense that itâ€™s cheaper to execute someone than to house, feed and take care of them for the rest of their natural life. But there are a lot of unavoidable costs that make a death sentence far more expensive than a sentence of life without parole.
Most of these costs result from the unique status of the death penalty within the US justice system. Because itâ€™s the only truly irreversible form of punishment, the Constitution requires a long and complex judicial process for capital cases, including several levels of mandatory review after a death sentence is issued. The appeals process takes decades to complete.
Studies of the California death penalty system, the largest in the US, have revealed that a death sentence costs at least 18 times as much as a sentence of life without parole would cost.

https://deathpenalty.org/facts/5-myths-death-penalty/


>	A 2011 study by Ninth Circuit Judge Arthur L. Alarcon and Loyola Law School professor Paula M. Mitchell calculated that California taxpayers have spent more than $4 billion since capital punishment was reinstated in 1978, and estimate the annual cost of pursuing executions to be $184 million more than pursuing life without parole. Since then the expenses have only grown, and total cost estimates now exceed $5 billion since 1978."
