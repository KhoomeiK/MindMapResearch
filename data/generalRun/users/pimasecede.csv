ukpolitics,ff5sky8,t1_ff36wj6,1579608651.0,"I agree with you in principle, but it’s pretty common to have processes in place to prevent majoritarianism.

The US Congress and electoral electoral college is set up to prevent exactly that. Each state is equally represented in the senate, despite massive disparities in population size between them. The EC similarly conveys huge power to smaller states in presidential elections. This is common in federally structured democracies.

The UK is unitary, and there is no constitutional provision for Scotland, NI and Wales to have veto power. If I were from those places I would absolutely be looking to create those provisions or be independent; it’s scary how easy it is for England to impose major decisions on them without any semblance of consent."

Women Are A Huge Reason Why Trump's Poll Numbers Are So Bad
Specifically, if the Sanders-Trump voters in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania had voted for Clinton, or even stayed home on Election Day, those states would have swung to Clinton, and she would have won 46 more electoral votes, putting her at 278 — enough to win, in other words.

But then, it's not as simple as that. First off, this counterfactual world in which these voters didn't vote for Trump rests on a few ifs. If the Sanders-Trump voters in these three states had defected and if nothing else had happened to somehow take electoral votes from Clinton elsewhere and if this survey is correct ... then yes, Clinton would have won. (Some would also argue that if Clinton had campaigned more in the so-called ""blue wall"" states, she also could have picked up more votes.)”

civ,fduxrpk,t1_fdut802,1578740699.0,"What difficulty are you playing on? It’s uncommon to see the pantheon you need taken on turn 15.. especially on lower difficultys (id probably rage quit lol) but it’s not unheard of. There isn’t a huge amount you can actively do to get a pantheon earlier, other than play with a religious focused Civ. Peter or Gitarja will always get the first pantheon because of their unique abilities.


Otherwise, it’s situational: being the first to meet a religious city state, picking up villages for the faith bonus or a relic (which are more uncommon than other bonuses); maximise your chances to get these by building a scout first and using your warrior to explore quickly. Natural wonders and lux resources will also give faith in some circumstances. You can’t control these factors, but you can 
set the up with legendary starting position and abundant resources in the pre game, which give you better chances for wonders and lux.


The other thing is to have a second pantheon in your mind to take. There’s a pantheon that gives you a free settler, which is the most powerful non situational pantheon in the game, should be the immediate go to if you don’t get your first choice. The one that gives culture to pastures rarely gets taken and is a very powerful boost to early culture.


For me, early game is the most fun because the decisions you make have huge consequences for what happen later, it’s all about seeking maximum value and every detail is so important. I’d recommend watching YouTube vids on early game play. Potato Mcwhiskey does whole game play throughs and he’s awesome at early game. Saxy gamer is also worth looking at."

The Partisan by Leonard Cohen.


For the former, try listening to Alan Lomax’s Italian recordings, it’s on YouTube and Spotify. Lomax travelled around Italy in the 50’s recording folk music as part of a research project (along with lot of other countries music cultures). The song I’d particularly recommend is La Partenza, link below. I heard this years ago, and could never find it again until just now, so thanks for the prompt.
