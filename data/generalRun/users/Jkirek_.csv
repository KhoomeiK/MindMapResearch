With an unlucky early game, you can't force a mediocre comp unless it's given to you. If you get a good early game, you are forced to build on top of it, rather than transitioning away. You also have a rough time going for brann comps, because you can't reroll for buffs. Demons is extremely difficult, since you're last to the floating watchers and have a rough time rolling for more demons. And the list goes on.

After that you need to get good rolls on 5 to stabilize, to get stats (not megasaur). At that point you can start winning against most comps because of stats, but you'll still lose to demons. 

If you face demon people, instead of surviving 2 losses and then getting lucky rolls (usually taking 20-30 damage), you need to survive 3 or 4 turns while getting lucky rolls. It's so difficult that going murlocs is very unrealistic, you're much better off getting 2nd or 3rd with a different comp than suiciding to 7th trying to get lucky.
