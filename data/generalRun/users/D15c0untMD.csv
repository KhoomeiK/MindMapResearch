Then there’s special coronary CT scan which allows you to image the amount of calcified plaques in your coronary artheries. It’s not as sensitive though.
And of course CAG, a coronary angiogram. A catheter is placed in your heart cavities via your leg artery, and a dye injected, that can be seen under xray. Under live imaging, we look at the way the dye distributes along the coronary arteries, and, if need be, can go in at significant areas stenosis and dilate them with a balloon, and propping it open with a small metal mesh called a stent. You’ll be on blood thinners for a good while after though, and low dose aspirine for the rest of your life.

Also: stress ergometry, where you sitnon a home trainer on increasing resistance while wired to an ecg, to see at what point you develop dyspnea. More testing ventricle function than presence of plaques, but that often goes hand in hand.

Other cardiac structures can be viewed directly via ultrasound (either through the chest wall, which is quick, but doesn’t show as much, or while swallowing a sonography lead and imaging from inside the esophagus (which is obviously more invasive). Classic ecg can show some signs, but is also interesting for rhythmic anomalies."
