Well... that's just it. What is chemical change? Bonding is a spectrum, not discrete. The distinction between hydrogen, ionic, covalent bonding is useful, but arbitrary. Sodium chloride is a polymeric ionic lattice in the solid state, but individual ions with solvation shells when dissolved in water, that's a very significant change and it really can't be said to be the same material. The ionic bonds between Na+ and Cl- *form* as the water is removed, so it's really not that clear cut.

chemistry,fdfafcq,t1_fdf85h6,1578357070.0,"Can you give any examples of reactivity being reduced with increased pressure?

With that example we get into a bit of a philosophical discussion of definition of what the ""thing"" is. I'd argue that there, the ""thing"" is probably some kind of hydrate or what-have-you of their desired compound, since the interaction with water is so strong as to stabilise it in that way. That's not really the same ""thing"" as the anhydrous compound even if it can generate it readily. Analogous is the extreme example of sodium and chlorine stablising each other by redox. Chloride is clearly a different thing from chlorine. Similarly I don't really see salt hydrates as the same thing as their anhydrous counterpart, and they definitely have different melting points, stability to decomposition, etc.

So you can be pretty confident that something doesn't have a liquid phase if some solid decomposes at some temperature under vacuum or inert atmosphere. If it were important enough, you could add very good computational support by looking at bond energies or transition states of the decomposition pathway. 

The best examples are thermally unstable organometallic compounds which undergo some sort of rearrangement above a very low temperature (e.g. -80 C) and are solid under vacuum below that temperature.

No u. The price to the consumer is cheaper if you don't make a profit. ""Competition"" is irrelevant because programmers want to keep their job whether working for a private company or the government. People in jobs everywhere are terrible, public or private.

I do admit I've never worked for the US Govt, and I could easily be convinced that it is a uniquely useless institution. It would explain why you are the richest country in the world but still can't maintain a first world standard of living for the average person. But that is not a feature of governments in general, and is primarily caused by the radical free market philosophy you are espousing here.

>What's the population? How do the tax laws differ from the U.S.?

Much lower than the US, which would imply a much higher per-capita cost (though we have significantly lower overall taxation). Simpler tax code, but you'd be paying for that regardless of whether the app was developed by the govt or privately so it doesn't factor in to this. [The UK, Germany, Japan](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-other-countries-use-return-free-tax-filing) among many others have similar systems. The US is simply behind the times."

Per person who uses it, when that's almost everyone over about 16 in the country? Yes, it is. For a sense of scale, the US could spend *half a billion* dollars developing such an app and it'd be less than $2 per taxpayer.

Uh, twice, and that's an incredibly unlikely scenario because:

The government doesn't have to profit from app development so it's inherently cheaper. Programmers still have to do their jobs to be competitive for their jobs.

But the fact remains that alcohol is *objectively* worse for people than many other drugs (cannabis, MDMA, magic mushrooms and LSD to name the most important ones), so I'm not sure the basis for your view is very sound. Your post doesn't make your view very clear but from my reading and in my opinion, it's a pretty immature way of thinking. 

For example, you go directly to addiction when many of these other drugs are demonstrably far less addictive than alcohol. So why is it that you think alcohol is okay in moderation but not weed (in moderation)?

It sounds like you think anyone who takes drugs other than alcohol is addicted to them, which while a common (and therefore somewhat understandable) view, is basically a lie. I totally support your position not to take drugs as the best choice, but I would examine your biases if I were you."
