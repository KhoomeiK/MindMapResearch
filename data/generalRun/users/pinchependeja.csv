I’ve tried to use an expired coupon on accident before and when I was told I couldn’t use it, I was like oh shit my bad not CAN I SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER."

But I’m trying to give myself a schedule this semester where I’m still working a decent amount, but I have some breather time even if some days are going to be rough going straight from class to work. This semester I’m putting my mental and physical health above the rest."
TalesFromYourServer,fdgxzzr,t1_fd7pz7s,1578411092.0,I think some places still operate with the “must be 21” mindset even in some of those states. My mom and I were in a restaurant in Wyoming (and we googled multiple times to double check) where supposedly minors could drink if they were with a parent and they refused saying I needed to be 21.

I once had a woman come in and ask to be seated by the fireplace. I told her oh it’s not on (because it was winter and we only turn it on when it’s like below 40 or something like that.) She said oh and that was it or so I thought and once we got to the table I was taking her to I laid her menu down and told her about when we do have it on and her attitude dramatically changed. She said in the nastiest way, “I don’t care if it’s on, I just wanted to sit by the fireplace.” It doesn’t sound nasty but her tone and voice conveyed it all. 

Legit I was so taken aback because of course people have their preferences, but the way she said it was so rude. I was like oh okay sorry my bad you know, usually people want to sit by it because it’s on not because of some random ass reason. So we went over to a table by the fire place, I apologized again and went back to the host questioning myself and the situation. I used to be a not very chipper host and my RBF game is strong - so I thought I had improved and been having a good day but that interaction felt like it set me back. 

Five minutes later I had gone to the back to stock something, and I came out and that bitch was back at the table I had originally sat her at. Just wanted to sit at the fireplace for no reason my ass."
