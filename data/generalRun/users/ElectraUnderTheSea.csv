Have dad tell her he cares about her and wants to have her around. He should spend more time with her and insist on it, even if she resists (within reasonable limits of course). I think her behaviour is testing limits and also to get attention, as it seems she doesn't get much of it.

Now, if for instance he ended up happily single some years into the future, and happened to bump into you in a store and started catching up on life, totally worth reconnecting as the bad feelings would likely be gone so you could start a relationship (be it friendship or not) afresh.

Even if he does try to get back together and you decide to give him a chance, do keep your eyes open to see whether he wants YOU back, or just the safety and predictability of a relationship. Be sure he doesn't see you just as a fall back plan.

In my personal experience (as someone who was once in your ex BFs shoes) and coming from a culture where long term relationships are the norm, I am yet to see anyone trying to get back together again with the long term partner they dumped: if you ""dare"" to leave the comfort and security of such an established relationship, with likely all the family, friends and financial entanglement that go with it, it means you are dead set in your decision and won't ever look back again.

stepparents,fe3m3gj,t3_ennyev,1578850574.0,"Very often it is a power play for them: they mention dad (and mom) doing something better than you because they know it affects you. You should have merrily told them ""ok no worries, more for me!"" and not give them the pleasure of seeing it hurt you. And sometimes it is the loyalty bind to mom which speaks louder: they can't acknowledge you do any ""motherly"" thing well as it would mean they are betraying mom. 

If it is of any consolation, my stepkids often complain I can only boil pasta and little else (mostly true), unlike their mom and dad who cook like gods (they freaking do, I'll admit it). And you know, I owe it and I don't care, if they want they can cook themselves :) last thing i am going to do is to show them they can compare me to mom to make me feel bad about myself.

But yeah, your feelings are totally valid. It is not petty because it is one more thing to add to a string of thankfulness, but just remember it is more often than not their loyalty to mom speaking, and not a dislike of yourself."
relationships,fe2ri47,t3_enkda3,1578842026.0,"Is he really depressed or just saying he is to get out of responsibility? Depression can make people be really mean and unfair sometimes, and do absolutely nothing at home or in the relationship - obviously it is not fair to you and he absolutely should not do it, depression or not. If he doesn't work, under normal circumstances he needs to pull his weight at home, it is a totally reasonable expectation to have.

If you think things can still be repaired, he needs to seek help and put some real effort into addressing his condition. If you are beyond done (what I think you are), then it is ok to leave too; this kind of behaviour can burn one out quite deep and make resentment replace love rather quickly. Keep in mind though that you will have to share your daughter and if he is not working, you will likely have to pay him child support and rely on childcare if he is not around; if he doesn't want your daughter more time with him, you will be a full time single parent and again receiving little child support as he has no income (even if he works part time, it will not be a lot I guess). So, while those considerations are not enough reason to stay in a loveless, unbalanced marriage, you do need to keep them in mind."
relationships,fe2o5hi,t3_enm87j,1578841089.0,"If the guy is in another country, legally I do not really know what you can do, if anything at all. Your daughter trusted you to tell you a secret that was bothering her for a long time, and if you react poorly she will never trust you again. At age 16, you should ask her if she has sent nudes (very likely I am afraid), what were they talking about, and make her see why it all was wrong, and why you won't let her travel to visit him or let her see him, or ever contact him again. If you blow up at her and blame her, she won't trust you next time she is in trouble or tell you the truth. Tracking her devices as only measure is not reacting well, you should only do this if she perseveres in seeing him or talking to him.

I do not understand why your husband and you are mad at her (rather than the dude or the situation itself) when she is a victim here. And she trusted you and came to you to admit she messed up, and is asking for your help. Talk to her, and explain her why this needs to end. If she is as mature as she sounds, she will understand. You can perhaps also ask her for the guy's contact and tell your daughter you will tell the guy to stay away and that if he tries further contact you will report him (kind of an empty threat but hopefully it works)."

She knows what she is doing, make no mistake. She is giving you an ultimatum because, somehow, subduing you is more important than having you by her side on that special day. I bet she is afraid you will look too pretty next to her and that you will take the attention away from her, hence she wants you to look worse and make you the person responsible for you dropping out. i cannot think of any other explanation for such a crazy, cruel request.

Get her ultimatum in text or email so you can prove she really said it (e.g. ask her if she was really serious when she asked that), and then tell your family about it all. This is horrible stuff, and it crushed my heart when I saw why you are so attached to your hair."
