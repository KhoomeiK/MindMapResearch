AskReddit,ffqbgui,t1_ffq3l05,1580129259.0,"Honestly for me I dont have anyone that would say anything so I am thinking about what would theoretically help me.

Maybe a calm reminder that its ok about whatever it was and a reminder to stop what im doing and be still for a moment. Control my breathing, close my eyes, and take some time to slow down the 8 billion thoughts racing through my head. Counting my slow breaths helps. Each in and out is 1. Take the type of breaths that you do when a doctor is listening to your breathing, in and hold for a sec and slowly out. For me I just breath in n out with my nose but all the meditation stuff says in with nose and out through mouth. 

Ive only just recently (2 weeks?) started doing the breathing and counting thing but its helping a lot so far. I got the idea from meditation which id love to try but dont reasonably ever have a quiet place to do so. 

Also keep in mind my stress and anxiety is a much bigger problem for me at this point than my depression is anymore so if her issues are more heavily depression this might not help as much."
