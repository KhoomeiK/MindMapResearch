90DayFianceFanArt,ffj8e8p,t1_ffj68yq,1579992904.0,"thank you so much for taking the time to give such a well thought through feedback! It’s very interesting because you put words to what I was already kind of feeling; I struggled with the eyes and ended up trying to converge to something that at least didn’t look too wonky/wrong. But i’m much happier with the simple, broad lines for the mouth and jaw. 

I’m practicing drawing in ink because I wish to capture features as simply as possible, and even though it’s frustrating when it gets messed up and there’s no way to fix it (although i did an emergency white out-surgery on the brow), I LOVE it when it actually does turn out right! 

Hair is also something that I struggle with, the proper techniques good artists use seem like they’ll take a looooot of time to practice and learn. I’ve started practicing techniques, but so far I find my best bet for a clean overall look is to just “go with the flow” and not overthink it. So I truly appreciate your comment on this because confident lines is exactly my goal and it’s an area of difficulty for me, so it really warms that you would acknowledge and comment on that, i appreciate that very much! 

And yes, I have noticed it’s generally far easier to do this “show features in simple lines” when drawing older or ... “less attractive” people. Of course young and beautiful people will have less distinct features to work of since everything is more like “where it’s supposed to be” and of the “right” size. 

Again thank you so so much for your feedback, it’s both very helpful and encouraging! Would love to see some of your artwork since you clearly know what you’re talking about!"
90DayFianceFanArt,ffj2zfx,t1_ffj127a,1579989086.0,thank you! I’m very happy you could see who it’s supposed to be; i’m a complete beginner and my goal is to learn to show characteristics with as simple lines as possible.
90DayFiance,ffj2oxr,t1_ffiyfh8,1579988880.0,"ooo innovation! I will try this out too. Thank you for mentioning/crediting me here, feeling appreciated now!"
90DayFiance,ffj1ymz,t1_ffixw4b,1579988360.0,"Glad you appreciate it! This is exactly what I love so much about this subreddit; an open space where we all spontaneously get emotional and warm, caring and supportive of each other. It’s the best corner of the internet. More info, my hair is very soft with fine strands and doesn’t curl naturally. But I like some movement in it since it’s  fairly long (recently cut off 5-6 inches. but still). I find the waves hold up best if I fold it while it’s just slightly damp, ALMOST dry but not completely, and then I sleep with it or keep this bun in my neck under clothes/winter jacket so it dries and also gets a little warm from body heat. Alternatively you can use a hair dryer to warm it up and dry; in that case, let it cool down before unfolding. I hope some of these tips turn out useful. And I wish you all the best!"

90DayFiance,ffitmed,t1_ffin3tn,1579982410.0,"I mean, I grab all my hair at the root as if going for a low ponytail. I keep my right hand tight around the hair at the root, and let the left hand run down the length of hair. When left hand reaches the end (tips), I lift them up to the right hand, thus folding hair in half. I grab the ends with my right hand, while keeping the root grip. Then I repeat; run my  left hand down along the new “section” i just created, lift up and fold over again. This was way too hard to explain in words... I’ll see if I can make a video/gif to show what I mean and post the link here, just a second."
90DayFiance,ffimxus,t3_etnyhx,1579977730.0,"I get waves like this if I fold (not twist) my hair into a ‘bun’ when it’s nearly dry after washing. Having long and thick soft hair might be key for this simple solution to work, not sure."

90DayFiance,fffdjr1,t1_fff2fka,1579881595.0,"ok but still, where is the logic to justify posting something that will be a spoiler for others? And you’re posting in a forum that IS most definitely related, so you’re much more likely to hit someone who doesn’t want spoilers, than a “random ad” was. You could easily use spoiler tag or post to r/90dayfianceuncensored"
90DayFiance,fffcwbq,t1_fff09ns,1579881184.0,"haha i’m sorry if my last comment seemed mean, I didn’t intend for it to be! I was just trying to be funny, and I have a special place in my heart for those words where a very small typo (or autocorrect) can give the whole sentence a new, different meaning. So I couldn’t resist.  But I was not trying to make fun OF YOU, just the linguistics - I am a nerd."
90DayFiance,fff2o7g,t1_fff09ns,1579874062.0,"yeah, don’t be too ambiguous, but to also don’t be too little ambiguous, i’m sure you know what i mean"
NoStupidQuestions,ffevlzq,t3_et6mos,1579867432.0,"Yeah a little. I do the same thing sometimes (although my main vice is (overuse of) parentheses). Both make the sentences too long, probably because we’re trying to cram too much information in there (in my case I think it’s because I have ADHD and so I have very very long trains  of thoughts, always digressing and thinking of new things that I think are relevant, but often it actually has very little to do with the sentence I originally started). 

But I’m always trying to remember that I don’t need to either talk or write in the exact same way my brain naturally forms sentences. I just have to self edit a lot (i’m not doing that right now, just to demonstrate my natural inclination). 

It’s not that hard to self edit. I’m actually a very good writer (in my own language! Which is not english), and I used to be editor in chief for my university newspaper. Just be aware of your tendencies, “kill your darlings”, and re-read your text for editing while keeping in mind that even though all your commas might technically be following all rules and CAN be there, that doesn’t mean they SHOULD be there. 

Some people seem to use super long sentences because they believe that’s something “smart people” will do, while short sentences seem more “simple minded”. This isn’t true. Quite often a short sentence is exactly what you need. Many find it helps readability. Only using short sentences isn’t great either. It can seem a bit dumb. Variation is key. Use both."

Then I read your comment and read it in Natalies voice, and it got my brain in a know because of how different the two versions was! And also how perfect it was because that was basically exactly her script in that scene, lol"
90DayFiance,ffensvm,t1_ffcwkcz,1579856375.0,"i thought the dark in Before The 90 Days season 1 looked very unnatural on her.

90DayFiance,ffeno0b,t1_ffdw7kn,1579856169.0,"ooh yes the too tight clothes. I have a theory that she and Stacey, especially since they often have the same clothes, are in a constant competition about having the smaller size. “Which size did you get in these jeans? I’m a XXXS”"

90DayFiance,ffen6l1,t3_et2rt3,1579855456.0,"I have implants and i can explain. This especially happens when I wear a “plunge neck” bra, a push up bra that pushes both inward and upward AND the cups are very tight, especially at the top, to make sure the boobs are both lifted up and squeezed (flat), thus pushing as much tissue as possible towards the cleavage area. The tightness of the cup cut the boob. This dent is probably more visible when you have implants because implant are much firmer than real boobs (almost jelly bean texture). It is NOT the edge of the implant, but a dent in the middle, caused by tight push up bra."

90DayFiance,ff7j0ll,t3_di1s2u,1579650686.0,"I agree with you, I like Zied a lot. Yeah, there's a big age difference, but I like Rubika a lot too and I think she looks amazing. Amazing for her age, yes, but i also think she's a beautiful and attractive woman no matter what age you compare with. And she is sweet and kind. So to me it's definitely believable to think that Zied is genuinely attracted to her. They have very similar sense of style too, and so overall I think they look like a well matched couple. They're in the same league, I would say (in sharp contrast to all the other ""US woman - Arabic guy"" couples we've seen on the show). 

And I admire Zied for being a muslim, arabic guy, who has been raised in a culture where men are expected to be jealous, controlling, temperamental, and unaccepting of stuff like divorce, adultery, homosexuality, children out of wedlock, women with kids from other men and so on. So of course those things will be difficult to adjust to and accept, and with Rubika he has been confronted with a few of those issues, which he has admitted made him angry - but HE WAS ABLE TO FORGIVE HER AND TREAT HER NICELY, and did so after clearly working through his feelings and reactions. I think that's reassuring. Accepting it without reaction would have made me think ""oh he just wants a green card so he doesn't really care about anything else"". But he seemed angry and hurt which I think indicates that he does care about Rubika. 

he's also just generally funny and charming and seems very likeable to me. I love his way of speaking english, too. And when they met at the airport he seemed so genuinely happy (and looking at Rubika I have no problem believing that he was genuine). So I root for them, they're one of my favorite couples!"
CasualConversation,ff79vte,t3_ert9js,1579644149.0,"Those are the best compliments! So much better than ""you're pretty"" or ""you're so good with numbers"" (well, thanks, DNA that I did absolutely nothing for), or ""you have beautiful eyes"" (well, aren't ALL eyes beautiful, really), stuff like that. Congratulations on having put in a mindful effort and now enjoying the fruits of those efforts! And I whole heartedly agree, dressing nicely does wonders for the self esteem, and in it's own way fashion is really a way to express your personality, creativity and artistic self. So I'm happy for you that you now get to see it's being received positively by the world. Have great days!"

climbharder,fez2gwa,t3_eqwibn,1579453230.0,"My indoor climbing course was done in one weekend; 4 hours each day, saturday and sunday (i.e. 8 hours total). We were a group of around 10-12 people. First some theory about climbing and the equipment, then practicing belaying each other on top rope. Theoretical explanations about lead climbing, then practicing that in pairs, alternating who's climbing so everyone learned both belaying and clipping quickdraws. And we all had to practice falling, and catching a fall, which we did in turns so the instructor could watch everyone do it and issue the national ""climbing licence"" for all of us. (For safety and insurance purposes, every climbing gym in Norway require users to have this licence, issued by certified instructors). 

I assume some places classes are individual with only the instructor, and other places it's in a group, maybe you'll be able to make a guess based on price point? I paid around 160 USD for my course. But keep in mind I live in Norway and prices probably differ a lot from place to place, and I don't know where you live, so it's probably a useless reference. I can only tell you that prices are generally *very* high in Norway, but from a Norwegian perspective, this was a very good price. 

Does it not say anything about the logistics on the websites? And, may I ask where you live and what the prices are? I'm invested and curious now!"
climbharder,feyxcxu,t1_feyua7j,1579451586.0,"I agree, I for one have absolutely no problems with interacting with people in person. No social anxiety or confidence problems, and also no (groundless)(haha) fear of heights or any issues that apply to climbing. But I still hate calling on the phone. Like, sometimes, if for instance I need my doctors office to issue some documentation or prescription, I'll rather make the trip to go there instead of just calling and ask them to mail it to me. I assume this rather irrational, but so very common, phobia of phones has to do with it being very unnatural to speak to someone in voice only and not being able to see their face. Also I hate the suspense of waiting for someone to pick up, and never knowing if/when it'll happen; I always get ""nervous"" while waiting and a little startled when they do. I know it's completely stupid and irrational, but clearly a lot of people feel apprehensive about phones, and I don't think that is a disqualifier for rock climbing *at all.*"
LifeProTips,feyudnq,t1_fex95k6,1579450637.0,"same here; where I live, you can look up phone numbers and find someone’s full name AND ADDRESS. Unless you go through the trouble of registering your number as unlisted, but that’s too bothersome so almost no one does that without a very good reason. And I don’t see how it would be such a huge problem to “be found” on facebook, you can block people there too. AND why would you give out any such information to someone you don’t want to “be found by”?! Of course sometimes people have bad luck and become involved with someone that they shouldn’t, it happens.

It worked, but it also numbed my whole mouth and felt like i’d been to the dentist. So apparently hard liquor is a good local anesthetic."
