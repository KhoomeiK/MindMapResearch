ipod,ffv4fe1,t3_evdrar,1580255427.0,Talk down a little but still not terrible. Is the casing in good shape?
ipod,ffsmqyb,t1_ffsixld,1580185664.0,"Absolutely, there can be tell tale signs mostly with resealed items. Typically they don't get the thing plastic right, the machine they use needs thinker plastic and the joins are too rough.

Doesn't mean they can't/haven't been getting better.

However, I meant my original question about knowing there's a pristine ipod with decaying battery in there never seeing the light of day. Who knows, it could be an ipod that was DOA.

At the end of the day, what are you buying if you never see the product. I could understand a figurine which you can see but ipod packaging is way different."
ipod,ffs55jp,t1_ffrlvgi,1580173392.0,Thanks for the reply! Do you ever get curious about the iPods inside? What’s the rest of your collection like?
ipod,ffrlidv,t1_ffreiyc,1580160505.0,"I’d hazard a guess and say the 4th Gen mono is on the left because it says Mac + PC, and not PC + Mac like the other one."
ipod,ffrlcuk,t1_ffriw29,1580160412.0,Is your collection all factory sealed? If so that’s amazing. Did you take long finding them for a reasonable price? I have only ever seen crazy unrealistic prices for them.
ipod,ffkdnzg,t1_ffi8plm,1580021054.0,Got a link? I thought a flash upgrade was a SD card upgrade.
ipod,ffdzrrw,t1_ffduohc,1579833010.0,Sometimes the screen being inverted is just because of the angle of the camera.
worldnews,ffbtzbv,t1_ffbtpcz,1579782665.0,Military.
ipod,ff2pdrf,t1_ff2k9hh,1579517760.0,Apple TV+ won’t work because they are from a subscription. Just like Apple Music won’t sync to an iPod.
brisbane,fem3x1g,t1_fem248m,1579238917.0,We do!....wait.
AppleWatch,fej0s8i,t3_epegqa,1579152823.0,I wish it could be used to send short voice messages and the recipient could play them back. Unfortunately it works exactly like a walkie talkie and makes it a little inconvient as it's not loud enough in a busy environment where it could be really useful.
todayilearned,feiwnye,t1_feiwfpc,1579149256.0,"I know you didn’t make the fire comment, but weird to reply to it and not to my comment directly. That meant I took it as a bad joke rather than just a plain comment. 

Sorry about my comment."
todayilearned,feiwahi,t1_feivu9n,1579148953.0,"You brought up that a kid needed to be murdered to bring in this law, following another comment about our fires. Pretty insensitive?

I acknowledge my comment wasn’t really needed. I hope you’re having a good day/night!"
todayilearned,feivron,t1_feiozc8,1579148549.0,"That was the 1960’s. 

How many kids have to die for gun control in the US though?"
AppleWatch,feioxko,t3_epcblc,1579143614.0,"My S3 watch randomly did a full resync yesterday without any prompting. I wonder if it was related to the issues? 

Never seen it happen before."
todayilearned,feie9x0,t1_feib63t,1579136487.0,In Aus our winnings are tax free and you can choose to not be revealed.
ipod,feggrlz,t1_fegggpi,1579092240.0,Please tell me if you find any too! 4G mono and photo parts are hard to find!
CFB,fecc3yf,t1_fecc27e,1578970493.0,How?
CFB,fecbyna,t3_eoehbi,1578970415.0,That toe is down. Not sure how people aren't seeing it.
CFB,fec8x0m,t1_fec8u9k,1578968725.0,Thank you for your sacrifice.
CFB,fec8kr8,t1_fec8ix3,1578968541.0,Did well to get out of the end zone.
CFB,fec4fiv,t1_fec4971,1578966500.0,Totally agreed. Stop trying to make them happen Apple!
CFB,fec44lm,t1_fec419d,1578966374.0,Not something I expected. I expect LSU to strike back hard.
CFB,fec36lu,t1_fec2zrm,1578965982.0,Absolutely. I get nervous when Burrow steps up though. He's a machine.
youtubetv,fe24q2o,t3_enlkzh,1578834427.0,Some movies will have it from the library I’ve experienced however channels won’t without your receiver up mixing it (from what I can tell).

funny,fdjhcvk,t1_fdjh4aq,1578470856.0,"Well, on the plus side it means we get something exciting coming in the near future rather than it already being said and done."
funny,fddgvev,t1_fddgfl7,1578311715.0,"Usually there are broadcast standards for different time slots. In Australia we have rules for language at different times of day, so that’s probably a similar thing for the US."
funny,fddckqr,t1_fddb98j,1578305737.0,"This seems like it’s straight off the broadcast. So, who knows if we’ll get a fully uncensored version."
funny,fddcjle,t1_fddbrtl,1578305687.0,"With how much services are paying for the US and UK versions of The Office, a show he created there is no way they’ll scare him with a blacklisting."
funny,fddcfcw,t1_fddcbep,1578305512.0,Watch from about the 5:20 mark.
IAmA,fctrbt9,t3_eisfup,1577955482.0,Hey! When I was in the South a store opened close by and fell in love hard. Wish I could have one back in Aus!
funny,fctj52m,t1_fct6heo,1577945079.0,"During Episode 1, we also knew that the Jedi were having problems with the Force and their ability to foresee things as mentioned in their meeting with Palpatine."
funny,fcsyxq2,t1_fcsyifv,1577928606.0,"But you’re also talking about a Yoda during wartime, and a Yoda who then had been isolated from other physical beings for 30 odd years."
