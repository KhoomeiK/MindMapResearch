Good
Productive 
Meh 
Stressful
Bad :(

So far I’ve had one brilliant and no bad, mostly good or meh this month. System works well for me!"
bulletjournal,ff4h2kr,t3_er7n5e,1579563439.0,I have some pink letter stickers I need to use up and I might just steal this idea for my own cover page
bulletjournal,fep87d4,t3_eq7v55,1579314323.0,"most of my bujo is trackers. I have one for mood, cleaning, productivity (this one I just write down everything I did in a day so I never go to bed feeling like I was unproductive), dreams, spending, and so on. Next month I think I'm going to include an important events page and maybe a food tracker. I mostly use my journal as a way to unwind right before I go to bed, so I don't have any daily or weekly type pages, especially since I leave my journal on my nightstand and don't take it along every day."
bulletjournal,fep5w6t,t3_eq9467,1579312830.0,"this is wonderful! I've been wanting to do a period tracker but I really have no need for the ones that just track when it happens, so one that tracks symptoms is just what I was looking for!"

bulletjournal,feesx9o,t3_eoqxr3,1579040520.0,Where do you buy stickers like this in bulk?
bulletjournal,feest2g,t3_eosc3w,1579040449.0,Love those pens! I’m trying out other pens for my bujo right now but I use those if I can’t find a color I like in my current pens and I also use those to take notes for my classes!
riverdale,fee5gh9,t3_eooonk,1579026788.0,"“Out of the way, Bert and Ernie”"
bulletjournal,fec6w0a,t3_eobg3a,1578967671.0,this is gorgeous. I normally only do monthly spreads so I might have to use this theme for my calendar page next month!
OSU,feaoxus,t3_eoa7nv,1578950922.0,"the parking lots behind smith steeb and park strad are C lots. No guarantee there will be a spot at that time of day, but probably your best bet."
bulletjournal,fe6gbnz,t3_enz11f,1578890038.0,"This is wonderful! I was thinking about doing something similar to this for mine, but I might do a valentines theme and make them all love/heart type symbols."
bulletjournal,fe04hfo,t3_enilzd,1578802850.0,I took inspiration from a similar mood tracker I found on Pinterest - my January theme was blues and grays so I stuck to that color scheme!
OSU,fdo907u,t3_emdx5u,1578600967.0,Econ 2001 was very easy
riverdale,fd53qm7,t1_fd39mt3,1578173920.0,It’s just a thought. It was probably his kidney.
riverdale,fd2j5h2,t1_fd15ro2,1578147984.0,I think they took his appendix or one of his kidneys. Nothing worth mentioning again
OSU,fb1ssml,t3_eb1l7y,1576440681.0,You’ll be fine but can I ask what the prank was
