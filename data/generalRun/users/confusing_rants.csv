depression,fegvxgv,t1_feg0oag,1579103733.0,"No I just had this girlfriend in high school, I had a crush on her, and she ended up being very suicidal, but because I had a crush on her I played into it and I actually started to think of suicide in the way she did because I liked her so much. Anyway. I havent been the same since. She opened my mind to depression."

NoFap,fdkbwvr,t1_fdkbrsn,1578500617.0,"Same here, I don’t have any real life friends either. I’ve lost them all. I used to have a ton of friends as a kid. Ever since people started growing up and getting girlfriends, reality hit me and my sadness and frustration has taken over, I can’t stop feeling bad. 

I can’t have fun with people. I’m too depressed to have friends. This is all a life or death situation for me. I’m always contemplating suicide. It’s not a mystery why I don’t have friends, I’m just too distracted to care and enjoy their time."
