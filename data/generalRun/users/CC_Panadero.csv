AmItheAsshole,fepjzen,t3_eqatcl,1579322467.0,"YTA big time. Imagine inviting close relatives to your home for a family gathering. Now, imagine one of them not only refusing to eat with you, but bringing in take out for every meal. It’s not just awkward, it’s extremely rude. You should also look into cast iron care, because soap is a big NO! 

Honestly, it sounds like you may have other unresolved issues with her family. This came across as very petty and passive aggressive. I would be mortified if my husband acted like that anywhere, but especially around family"

AmItheAsshole,fdwyjz8,t3_en6jau,1578763564.0,"NTA- I was grounded more often than not in high school. I didn’t bully anyone, but had strict parents and would sneak out fairly often. I figured we weren’t smoking, drinking, or using drugs, so what’s the harm? I hated my parents (particularly my Dad) at the time. Now that I’m a parent, I look back at those years and cringe. I was an asshole to my parents and they probably didn’t know what else to do with me. They would take the phone out of my room (this was 20 years ago before cell phones) and I’d have a friend bring me a spare to school. 

We have a wonderful relationship now that I’m out of my angry teen years. They are great parents, have been there for me through thick and thin, and I’m very proud and grateful to be their daughter. 

She won’t see it anytime soon, so don’t expect that, but eventually she will see that the punishment fit the crime. Bullying can have a lifelong impact on people. Maybe she could earn her senior prom back by volunteering at an after school program or something similar? Maybe don’t tell her that initially, if you do it. If she volunteers with a good attitude (without just doing it so she can go to prom) you could surprise her with prom privileges. Just make sure you tell her in time to get tickets, a dress, and possibly a date. 

Hang in there, you’re doing the right thing."

I don’t understand why she would need her own place, and unless she’d be keeping your child all day and night I can’t fathom her expecting you to support her completely. That’s crazy. 

On the other hand, personally I’d rather have a family member watch our daughter than put her in daycare. That’s just a personal preference though. 

If she currently lives far away, maybe she just wants to move closer to her grandchild but can’t afford to. I bet her tune will change if you guys say “thanks, but no thanks!” I mean at what point would you supporting her end?"

I can’t even imagine staying somewhere and leaving it trashed. Clearly your family doesn’t respect you and your husband. I genuinely hope that everything works out and you all spend the holidays together next year. If it does, maybe you could suggest that everyone chip in and rent an Airbnb. That way you all stay together, but everyone is expected to clean their mess before leaving. 

We do that in the summer/fall and it works out great. There are 3 families and we take turns cooking. It works out better than I though possible. Either way, I hope this works out for you guys. You have nothing to apologize for and hopefully they will all come to their senses soon."
