You say men dont understand what women go through because they dont experience it. Well that's true of all you talking to me. Everyone hear says that what I'm saying is all bullshit and hyperbole. What if I said that about women's issues? Or LGBT issues? Od be a bigot. The only reason you're not is because you've decided on your view of my life experience and nothing will change it.

These things have been said to me. To my face. That my entire race and gender are worthless and inherently evil. Whether or not you believe doesnt change the fact that it happened.

My 3 closest friends are gay and another is a mexican immigrant. I dont hate them. I'd die for them. I acknowledge that i have privileges but that doesnt mean I dont deal with any issues. Men have issues that need to be acknowledged. Women have privileges that need to be acknowledged. 

And that's my point. How can you expect me to fight and stand with you if you cant hear my issues? White men are made into the enemy. Even those that are allies. Like I said I have lgbt friends and minority friends. I have no problem with those groups. But this is a two way street. Everything I've said has been dismissed as lies and falsehoods. If you wont even passively acknowledge the issues I deal with as existing, how can you expect me to actively fight with you.

My issues may not be as bad as others but I will not stand for those that wouldn not stand for me if our roles reversed."

FragileWhiteRedditor,ff5o21t,t1_ff43spu,1579602637.0,"As someone who has dealt with this; he means you supported LGBT right, believed in social policies, werent racist, supported women, and fought against misogyny but were still never fully included in your social circle because you werent any of those minorities. 

A lot of minorities have a (possibly unconscious) resentment of straight white men and blame them for their problems and it comes out in their behavior. It sucks when you feel like you're doing everything right, doing what your told is right but still being treated differently. You may not believe me but stop and think how many times people say ""straight white men"" in an angry context.

This happened to me and many people I know. You can say it never happens and ignore. Whatever. I dont care. But if you expect these racist alt right white people to examine and acknowledge their subconscious racial biases, it's only fair that you be open to recognizing your own."
FragileWhiteRedditor,ff5nqnl,t1_ff5ldy9,1579602157.0,"Yeah well just because that's your personal experience, it doesnt reflect everyone else's. 

I fell into the alt right for a while because of this exact attitude. This guy is literally telling you his grievances and why hes being pushed that way and you just write it off. 

I left the alt right but I still hear the shit that pushed me there in the first place but I cant say anything about it because it's just met with ""oh boo hoo, poor white men"" and then called a fragile white man."

The fact that you're a man makes this even worse. You're a sexist piece of shit. The gender equivalent of a ""benevolent slave master.""

badwomensanatomy,fc3je6j,t1_fc3hc0u,1577391105.0,"Because women complain about how long it takes to do their make up. They do it to feel good but they feel good because they think it makes them look good. If that's not true, they're wasting their time. A 30 minute walk would do more for them than 30 minutes of make up that no one can see.

Some women genuinely enjoy doing their make up. That's great and I'm happy they have a hobby that they enjoy. But most women act like it's something they have to do or are pressured into by society. That's not doing it for yourself. They also complain about the unrealistic beauty standards for women and how hard it is to live up to them. Well if men say it's a waste of time, those unrealistic standards are, at least partially, only in your head.

My point is, if you like doing your make up because it's fun then do it. But if you treat it like some burden and complain about how long it takes, dont fucking do it. Regardless of what rhetoric people like to say, most women are not doing their make up for themselves. If you were in some twilight zone episode and found yourself to be the last person on earth, you probably wouldn't do your make up(or shave your legs, or wear nice clothes, or do your hair, etc.). Most women put on make up to look good for men(and just in general). Men do things to look good for women as well. And there is nothing wrong with either of those."

You say men dont understand what women go through because they dont experience it. Well that's true of all you talking to me. Everyone hear says that what I'm saying is all bullshit and hyperbole. What if I said that about women's issues? Or LGBT issues? Od be a bigot. The only reason you're not is because you've decided on your view of my life experience and nothing will change it.

These things have been said to me. To my face. That my entire race and gender are worthless and inherently evil. Whether or not you believe doesnt change the fact that it happened.

My 3 closest friends are gay and another is a mexican immigrant. I dont hate them. I'd die for them. I acknowledge that i have privileges but that doesnt mean I dont deal with any issues. Men have issues that need to be acknowledged. Women have privileges that need to be acknowledged. 

And that's my point. How can you expect me to fight and stand with you if you cant hear my issues? White men are made into the enemy. Even those that are allies. Like I said I have lgbt friends and minority friends. I have no problem with those groups. But this is a two way street. Everything I've said has been dismissed as lies and falsehoods. If you wont even passively acknowledge the issues I deal with as existing, how can you expect me to actively fight with you.

My issues may not be as bad as others but I will not stand for those that wouldn not stand for me if our roles reversed."

A lot of minorities have a (possibly unconscious) resentment of straight white men and blame them for their problems and it comes out in their behavior. It sucks when you feel like you're doing everything right, doing what your told is right but still being treated differently. You may not believe me but stop and think how many times people say ""straight white men"" in an angry context.

This happened to me and many people I know. You can say it never happens and ignore. Whatever. I dont care. But if you expect these racist alt right white people to examine and acknowledge their subconscious racial biases, it's only fair that you be open to recognizing your own."

badwomensanatomy,fc3je6j,t1_fc3hc0u,1577391105.0,"Because women complain about how long it takes to do their make up. They do it to feel good but they feel good because they think it makes them look good. If that's not true, they're wasting their time. A 30 minute walk would do more for them than 30 minutes of make up that no one can see.

Some women genuinely enjoy doing their make up. That's great and I'm happy they have a hobby that they enjoy. But most women act like it's something they have to do or are pressured into by society. That's not doing it for yourself. They also complain about the unrealistic beauty standards for women and how hard it is to live up to them. Well if men say it's a waste of time, those unrealistic standards are, at least partially, only in your head.

My point is, if you like doing your make up because it's fun then do it. But if you treat it like some burden and complain about how long it takes, dont fucking do it. Regardless of what rhetoric people like to say, most women are not doing their make up for themselves. If you were in some twilight zone episode and found yourself to be the last person on earth, you probably wouldn't do your make up(or shave your legs, or wear nice clothes, or do your hair, etc.). Most women put on make up to look good for men(and just in general). Men do things to look good for women as well. And there is nothing wrong with either of those."
