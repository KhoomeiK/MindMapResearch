CampingandHiking,ffb2pl6,t1_ff9xqea,1579750288.0,I love seeing people visiting this area! I took my last camping trip with my mom before she passed at the low campground there and just love the areas. Such good memories!
ArcherFX,ffb1fc3,t1_ffa4wqi,1579749402.0,I just used this one in another sub!
ArcherFX,ffb1dt1,t1_ffa141u,1579749373.0,"I sent my wife a picture of our cat sitting on the computer yesterday and said he was working from home for the day. I leave the room and come back a few minutes later and the other cat has pulled out a bunch of q-tips and spread them all over the room. So I send her a pic of that and told her the other cat said, “You’re not my supervisor!”. 

I’m still laughing about it."

Welding,ffazki6,t3_esl6la,1579748146.0,I thought camper shell... then I remembered the wheels.
Endo,ffayoua,t3_esm7rj,1579747558.0,"I absolutely think you need to see another doctor. The lap is really the gold standard for diagnosing endo according to colloquial evidence in this sub, but also from so many surgeons that have been seen by the users of this sub. I went through 7 years of pain before things escalated and I went to the ER twice in one week after not having been to an ER since I was in Kindergarten. I still had to move to another state before I found a surgeon who specialized in endo. It took her less than twenty minutes with me to agree that I needed surgery and she had me under two weeks later."
Incorgnito,ffatuo7,t1_ffal3v6,1579744356.0,I’m still trying to get Ceagle started lol
treecaching,ff503ds,t3_erj4kp,1579576654.0,Awesome! Thank you for helping to keep this sub alive
Catsmirin,ff46nt4,t1_ff3vn3z,1579556706.0,"My mom used to rescue feral cats and her trick was to put them in an enclosed shower. Usually it took less than three days. The first day she would put them in there with food and water. Second day fill the food and water. Third day do the same and get in the shower with them. This seemed to help them calm down and show them that she was there to help. I think she might have gotten in the shower with them as soon as they would let her, but my memory is a little rough."
CRH,ff3335p,t1_ff2suvs,1579532419.0,There is a guy at my local antique shop that sends people that buy anything home with a steel penny. Such a sweet guy!
Baking,ff31z7c,t1_ff2zhvb,1579531568.0,I do a no water bath cheesecake and for mine it’s dependent on taking it out when the middle is barely still jiggly. That way it can finish while it rests and therefore doesn’t crack
BorderCollie,ff26zbo,t3_er74fx,1579495591.0,Focus. Speed. I am speed.
corgi,ff268zo,t1_ff25kdm,1579494981.0,"I do! I think it is so precious, my mom taught me about it when I was little and she was raising corgis. Such a magical legend!"
BorderCollie,ff25rk3,t3_er5330,1579494581.0,My family always taught fetch in a hallway with all the doors closed and lots of praise!

Baking,ff24ud3,t3_er70r4,1579493848.0,Nice job! I always consider a cheesecake with no crack a success!
endometriosis,ff24snk,t3_er5m3p,1579493810.0,"My excision surgeon was very clear with me that I should get about a year of relief. If we get more than that, wonderful! But she didn’t want me to count on one surgery being a fix all, especially with having a nodule she had to leave on my rectal wall for further testing."
succulents,ff22tn7,t3_er79uj,1579492273.0,I just put a couple baby succulents in an old container that used to be part of like an ice cream cone set. Looked odd but once I put plants in it then it turned into a unique and cute plant pot

unexpectedhogwarts,ff1yvot,t3_er04ey,1579489369.0,My wife hasn’t read the books or watched the movies and I’ve made no post on Sunday jokes a few times. Then she said it the other day and I was dying!
Idaho,fewaork,t3_eqr8um,1579407636.0,Was expecting a dumpster fire and was happily surprised
corgi,fewa2gp,t3_eqratq,1579407391.0,My family raised corgis when I was young and one of my favorite things was watching the little ears start to pop up. Such cuteness!
Welding,few9fgi,t3_eqrdee,1579407125.0,I love seeing this! I grew up in a very rural area and was the only girl in my shop class and I won every competition we had. My family never really encouraged me to move up from that first class and I really wish they would have as I’m now nearing thirty and looking at getting into welding.
MaliciousCompliance,few8aar,t3_eqrfyl,1579406804.0,I didn’t think those kind of mattresses came with springs. My particular brand didn’t and I don’t remember any that we researched having them. Seems like it would make it even harder to try and recompress!
personalfinance,fevtusc,t3_eqqitt,1579401427.0,I would definitely let them tell you first what they are bringing to the table. It sounds like they might even be willing to help with moving costs. If  they say there will be a pay cut ask them the number they are thinking and state you will be doing the same work and feel your pay is adequate and see what they come back with. If it sounds like a pay cut is inevitable then give them the number you are comfortable with. Good luck!
Incorgnito,fesl3uk,t1_fesjk4z,1579366351.0,"Oh my goodness, you have no idea! Someone going into another apartment? He wants to talk about it. Upstairs neighbor walks around the living room? He wants to talk about it. Birds chirping outside? He wants to talk about it. Mailman opening the mailboxes? He wants to talk about it. Kittens are playing? He wants to talk about it. Lol I love the stinker!"
