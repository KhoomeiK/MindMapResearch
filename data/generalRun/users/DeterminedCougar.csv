Your advice is spot on: plan ahead and practice. The FD said we had basically 2 minutes to get up, get out once the alarm went off. The smoke will get you before the flames. It got our cats. We had no idea how to evacuate. Husband forgot about not opening a hot door. We couldn't see in the smoke and chaos. I now keep carriers in the bedroom and our cats sleep there with us at night. God forbid I have another fire but if I ever do, I want a fighting chance to get them out alive."

cats,fdnu5hb,t3_embxus,1578592890.0,"30 years ago, my parents made a long distance move and I had my childhood cat, one of a litter of three we adopted as kittens, at my rental place for a time. I still regret not keeping her permanently by my side. I loved her so but the mom played the emotional blackmail game \[*""she's happier with her siblings not alone with you, you work all day, not enough attention to her"",* yada yada\]. You go right ahead keep your beautiful kitties close and indoors-believe me you will not regret this and they will be happiest with you!"
