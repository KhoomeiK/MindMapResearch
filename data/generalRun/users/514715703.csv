UnresolvedMysteries,ffohqbi,t1_ffn5jfu,1580077692.0,I’ve listened to the podcast.  I stand by my theory.
UnresolvedMysteries,ffmegpl,t1_ffm6n2x,1580053354.0,I agree with this theory.  I’ve read that a particular family member had a habit of following Libby.  Her taping this mans presence on the bridge may have been her attempt at proving to others that this family member does follow her.   Sort of saying...see I wasn’t lying.  The press conference only solidified this belief for me.
WattsCaseEvidence,fflx014,t1_fflslnb,1580045181.0,Well I guess I’m done on that sub.  Kessinger plays an active part in the murders imo.  Sorry you had problems yesterday cricket.  Chin up.  Don’t let the bastards get to you.
TLCsisterwives,ffckdpi,t1_ffbrzvf,1579801318.0,He’s like a succubus.  He steals everyone’s life force.
Chriswatts,ff6n4zt,t1_ff6m82w,1579630743.0,I definitely see her.  Holy shit.
