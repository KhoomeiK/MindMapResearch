Or that culturally, the entire feminine beauty market existence depends on convincing women they are ugly.

udub,fcjmz46,t1_fcjmp2i,1577694532.0,"70% of Psych majors do not pursue post grad education even though its a field with growing demand.  But I don't think that should worry you.  The vast majority of people who graduate do not pursue a post grad education.  If you major in psychology you're going to come out ahead of a lot of people going into graduate Psych field who do not have a degree in Psych.  You'll have research and background knowledge.

It's a pretty good spot to be in financially and time wise."
udub,fcjm7e0,t1_fcjl67a,1577693491.0,"Ah I see.  Well allow to give you a little bit of a warning.  There is an army of biology PhDs out there who hate their research/jobs and make very little money.  I have met more biology PhDs than any other field.  So unless you're going for premed, I would think a little more on the end goal of a biology major.
I think at least right now, stick with the psychology major.  Because if you move onto post grad education you will beat out 70% of Psych majors and there is a pretty good salary at the end of the tunnel.  With the plus that Psychology is a very flexible field and you end up studying biology anyway."

udub,fcjk1wp,t1_fcjjmy7,1577690727.0,"I'm not sure what hoops there may be but it's pretty common to switch your major, I don't it'll be a problem.  But make sure you have your reasons fleshed out.
What turned you off about psychology, if I can ask?"
