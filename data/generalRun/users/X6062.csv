I dont know how much money you have but you can build an ok pc for $300, and then later add a grapics card later to make it not just an ok pc but a good pc."

TIHI,fdfv15x,t1_fdfr86p,1578370954.0,"I agree being against this kind of surgery is insane since adults should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies. But to me the most interesting part about this kinda stuff is the physiology behind it. Are people born trans or is it a product of their environment? Id guess that its a product of their environment since most things in physiology are but I have no sources on that and its just a guess. You know of any studies on this?

&#x200B;

Also I think its fascinating how people talk about this kinda stuff (im guilty of doing the same) like its politics, when its really not something you can be ""against"". Its kinda like being against someone else being vegetarian, its not poetics. I might not want to be a vegetarian myself but that doesn't mean that I should (or can) force vegetarians to stop being vegetarians."
teenagers,fdbquyv,t1_fdbjdmy,1578260427.0,"? At some point both the java and bedrock game servers will shut down. It might not been anytime soon but its gonna happen. And when it does you will still be able to play on java with friends since you can host your own servers.

This is a massive problem with games nowdays, you wont be able to play 80% of games in 30 years since they require some sort of central server that you have no control over."
teenagers,fdb42vx,t3_ekae2y,1578253515.0,"But we are finally rid of python 2, for the first time in 40 years a bunch of things were released into the public domain, and there are lots of cool things coming up like spaceX getting astronauts into space for the first time in February.

oh and who could forget all the games coming up like half-life alyx and cyberpunk 2077."
teenagers,fda9x98,t1_fd8bzgb,1578243453.0,"Have you tried it? Yes you can abuse the way windows loads in dlls and get your dll to load when the game is run, but interacting with anything in the game is basically impossible due to the fact that most functions (if not all) arent exported). Now there is a way around this but it would literally take years since there is no way of knowing all the offsets for all the functions in the code. And even then all your work would be reset next time they recompile (so next update)"
teenagers,fd7qzay,t1_fd7qf7t,1578208722.0,"If you actually read what the link you just sent it says that the java edition only uses java, but that the bedrock edition is written in c++."

teenagers,fd78prm,t1_fd6iinp,1578200894.0,"Idk man java is better, unlike bedrock you will still be able to set up a server for java when the actual main game-servers shut down."
teenagers,fd77fgs,t1_fd6s8z6,1578200411.0,Yeah thats basically java 1.15
teenagers,fd772ks,t1_fd73i5b,1578200277.0,"Its the same thing that's preventing real modding on the bedrock version. C++ code is compiled to raw machine code that your cpu can run natively, but is a lot harder to understand since the compiler does some crazy stuff with it. While java is compiled to a sort of half-compiled format thats a lot easier to modify and should let your program run on any cpu.

These ""hacks"" you're talking about aren't actually hacking the server, but are just a mod that helps you aim and stuff. So by making modding really hard its also really hard to make these ""hacked clients"""
teenagers,fd74v1l,t1_fd655lt,1578199459.0,"Some people seem a bit confused on how programming languages work here.

First of all c# is *very* similar to java but with a few differences while c++ is completely different.

Also code made in c++ isnt automatically better/faster/whatever than java, its just that its a bit lower level so in general you can squeeze a bit of extra performance out of it. C++ main problem is for the people writing the code. Its an ancient language with a bunch of feature like pointers that makes making mistakes really easy."

teenagers,fd72byo,t1_fd6bju9,1578198563.0,"Also this might just be that im used to java but to me bedrock just ""feels"" wrong, the rendering is a bit off, the movement is... Idk how to describe it but its weird."
teenagers,fd71kl2,t1_fd6bwl1,1578198314.0,"Consoles dont run ""c++"", they run machine code just like any other computer, so there is no reason why you cant make console apps in any language."
teenagers,fd70e81,t1_fd58gw8,1578197935.0,"Pfff ""better language"" different programing languages have different strengths and honestly c++ is a mess. The fact that minecraft is java is what  make it so moddabe! Compiled c++ is basically raw machine code and therefore really hard to modify."
