JoeRogan,ffgbp38,t1_ffejbej,1579902705.0,"""the left"" involves progressives, centrists, and moderate right wing camps. The current republican party isn't even really conservative in policy anymore."

OurPresident,ff7pjyz,t1_ff60xea,1579655229.0,"Joe has always been ""progressive"". He plays uninformed centrist because it allows him to ask the questions conservative interviewers typically avoid, while still appearing to be impartial. Joe Rogan is probably one of my favorite journalists, how absurd is that? Lmao."
teenagers,fetoo1a,t1_fepzixz,1579377696.0,As an adult this legit made me chuckle. You're all clones of your parents and free will is a lie!

pathofexile,fduacer,t1_fdu5yw0,1578730318.0,"There is a possibility that a meteor could kill you at any second, wanna buy some super special meteor insurance? You're ignoring all of the people literally being scammed in favor of some imaginary character you've concocted because you're bad at having a discussion in good faith. GOODDAYSIR."
pathofexile,fdu43wa,t1_fdu0yu4,1578727189.0,"What I am telling you is that there are literally tens of MMO's with just as profitable crafting and the community handles scammers pretty easily without admins having to ban anyone. There are plenty of chat moderators in Tera Online, they don't ban you or mute you for calling out scammers, they ban you for being racist or rude. Can you point to a single instance where your hypothetical has happened and there was significant damage? 

  Maybe it's just too simple for me to understand, I guess I'm just too stupid to believe complete nonsense."
pathofexile,fdtxm0g,t1_fdtmxp4,1578723884.0,"This does not happen in any other mmo all of which allow naming and shaming, just not witch hunts without proof. I don't understand your logical steps here, can you explain it in more detail so I can understand?"

AmItheAsshole,fdkmhpn,t1_fdk1fxw,1578506624.0,You literally came here to backseat relationship drive. Why do liars like you always just out themselves constantly?
rickandmorty,fd6q3kd,t1_fd5rz4b,1578194349.0,"What? This was probably the worst episode of R&M so far. This new season was generally just figuring out the formula and producing episodes according to it (more or less), but with this episode I caught myself for the first time being bored and checking how much time is left to the end of episode.

There is no real content anymore, just exploiting the easy stuff. Flat tyre in space was not the good kind of silly which they wanted to make, but just regular silly, even for R&M world. And what you wrote, that's excactly the problem, I think it's just non creative, a bit infantile forced joke. It's clear that the creators ran out of fuel this season (there were some cool things like that toilet in the enchanted forest) and are just buildnig on the foundation they made with previous seasons, but it's a bit painful to watch the artists that made such a great show struggle and be ok with bad product."

worldnews,fczn179,t1_fczmh68,1578104798.0,"He's everything that's wrong with our species in my opinion. I see zero scenarios where humanity buckles down and pulls through. Climate change was too late 20 years ago and these psychos are literally burning the forests, putting people in concentration camps, and trying to take healthcare and food assistance away from poor and dying people."

todayilearned,fcw829m,t1_fcw7i2j,1578019284.0,"Yeah that's why I hate fundamentalists, everything ""goes without saying"". Normal functioning adults are capable of discussing problems and facts, they don't need to bury them and ignore them and pretend the world is full of candy and spice and all the garbage donuts they give you at sunday service. It goes without saying."
todayilearned,fcw72t6,t1_fcw6k4u,1578018644.0,"Bro, shoving religion into every fucking moment is annoying to every single person that doesn't care about that religion. The guy pointed out that amish communities have their problems and they aren't holy people that never commit crimes.

  He added valuable information to the discussion, this conversation we're having right now is most definitely not."

Watching someone fumble is pretty satisfying though,  upvoted."

news,fccuozu,t1_fccsim9,1577602852.0,"In my experience growing up with a few jewish friends, their parents were super involved in their lives, when I was young I felt bad for them because they never seemed to be able to get out from under their parents, but as a 29 year old man I still think fondly of how much they cared about setting their kids up for success.

 In my experience Jewish american families typically care more about whats right, not what ""looks right"", which is admittedly another flaw I see in my past home life."

OurPresident,fca4691,t1_fca3hj0,1577562811.0,"Yeah, that justifies stealing the pathetically small token amount of land we gave to the native tribes of the united states. Were you born this way or did someone corner you in a dark house?"

NintendoSwitch,fc9j8h6,t1_fc9ekzb,1577553467.0,"It was JUST Christmas, are you retarded? Tons of people have been GIFTED switches, and even setting that aside, my point is nintendo shouldn't have pushed a shitty product, and people should not be OK with the issues just because they offered to fix it if you mail it to a specific location to be added to a queue of thousands of other broken joycons. Trying to spin this into ""poor people shouldn't be irresponsible then"" is really sick and I hope you're just having a shitty day. 

 I'm not gonna respond to the rest of the children that lack critical thinking skills and are incapable of arguing facts and have to resort to personal attacks. <3"

This whole ""Hey they screwed me over after I gave them 300$, but atleast they fixed it 2 months later after I gave them another 70$, and it was FREE too!"" is so weird?!
