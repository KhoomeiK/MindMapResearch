Bondedpairs,ffiixk3,t3_ettwns,1579974970.0,"So our boys have struggled a bit. The old man in the front, Gordo, we adopted as a feral, 3 years ago, already 2-3 years old. The gray boy in the back, Squirrel, was an 11 month old shelter cat we adopted 2 years ago. They were a bit rough in the beginning, mostly because Gordo never liked other cats and just wanted to sleep, but Squirrel always wanted to play. You could tell Squirrel wanted to just wrestle but Gordo felt he had to defend himself. It only got worse as Squirrel outgrew Gordo. 

Over time, they got along as love/hate brothers. Mutual chasing, but sometimes hissing, etc. As they’ve both gotten older, they’ve started to feel (especially Gordo) more and more comfortable sleeping closer and closer. We’re hoping one day they’ll actually cuddle."

VAGuns,ffi11we,t1_ffhy57j,1579961850.0,Indeed; I see nothing but an allegation in the OP. Where’s the wide-spread reporting about the presence of shell casings and that inferring anything at all?
CCW,fff0hep,t1_ffe0u0q,1579872253.0,"Agree with both comments. When I travel in rough areas I can’t carry I was already in the habit of carrying decoy items too. Standard part of my kit now. 

The ASP video posted above sounds interesting too, gonna check it out. 

There have been several video case studies posted the last few weeks. On the one hand is the first victim of the Texas church shooter. There were several mistakes made (stood up and identified himself as a target to the shooter before drawing, then struggled to draw his 6 o’clock carry, etc.), and it was horrifying to watch how long it played out before the shooter finally fired at him. 

Compare that to the videos of that lone store clerk in the phone repair shop or the guy in Brazil on the same side of the counter as the perp. A running theme in each of those was a fairly fast draw, but both of them did it while the perps attention was focused elsewhere, even for a moment. You won’t get the drop on someone staring at you with a finger on the trigger."

SmithAndWesson,feh3ht1,t1_feglrmn,1579108376.0,"This may sound silly but you’re using the M2.0 manual that came with the firearm? I don’t know how old it was, but I saw an original M&P manual that had different lube points (more I think) so that would be the first thing I check. 

Not sure what you mean by twangy? Resistance? Are you sure it’s seated right? Disassemble the slide and double check the rod/spring. I’ve put it back on before and had it be just a hair off the seat on the frame, slightly angled looking from the side like they show in the example photo in the manual. Just re-center it and push down and it was fine. If you’re getting any resistance on the slide after reassembly that’s probably it.

Edit: one thing I would add too, if you’re sure everything is reassembled properly, this is just a stiff frame/spring/magazine firearm. Especially brand new. If you haven’t shot a handgun in a while vs. the AK, in my case for instance it took a week or so of handling to get used to the levels of resistance and feel. Especially when checking the chamber off the front finger grips, or locking the slide back, or even just pulling the slide. Same goes for loading a full magazine with the slide forward. For some reason these M&P 2.0s take a really hard slam to get it in there, otherwise you risk the magazine not seating. You get used to it quickly though as your hands just get used to the pressure you need to exert. That was the case for me at least."

Great handling and feel, and both of my M2.0s have been flawless after a couple of thousand rounds at the range. I have the 9MM myself and don’t regret it at all.

Then No Reservations. Early episodes are great travel/food shows that are entertaining and will pique your palate.

I’d recommend at least going through some of No Reservations before you hit Parts Unknown because you can see that Tony’s experiences in episodes like e.g. Beirut completely changed the trajectory of his life and his focus in Parts Unknown being about visiting some of the most difficult places in the world to learn about them through their people and food."

What you learn is all of the different ways, behaviors, tools, and other strategies to protect yourself that don’t involve reaching for a firearm.
