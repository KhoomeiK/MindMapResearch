For the remake there was nothing at all keeping you from playing it in a more aggressive fashion. Was playing it more defensively probably the safer option? Absolutely, but that's also the way I play *every* game, so I'm not in a good position to determine if it's fun or not because that's what I inherently find to be fun. But even so, you could totally rush a map and try to achieve the objective as fast as possible. It didn't need a timer forcing you to do so. If you chose to play it slower, that was entirely on you if you don't find that to be fun.

With the sequel it didn't really change that except for adding in the timer. So now you were forced to play in a given fashion or lose. The gameplay didn't suddenly get modified in such a way that would make rushing more effective and defensive play more of a hindrance. The developers just added in an external mechanism to punish the player. That doesn't make the game more fun, it just makes it irritating and needlessly difficult."

It's also relevant when you go back to classic cartoons. Despite going on to be viewed as aimed at kids they were originally intended for general audiences.

But even then the difference between season two and three is significant.

They take the effort to show how much work goes into impersonating someone. Not just an impossible mask and voice changing gadget.

They would come to rely on masks much more in the future, but it was a rare case where they relied more on something approaching reality.

The current *M:I* films are fun, but what nearly every one after the first has forgotten is that it was largely about pulling off complex heists where the whole team had to act in perfect concert to accomplish their goal."

The Russian Consulate in San Francisco, until it was closed a few years ago, was long used as a major site for Russian intelligence, particularly on matters of technology and communications.

When they're trying to figure out the location via sound, you can follow it and actually end up with a pretty plausible part of the Bay Area.

Most of the locations are in pretty reasonable parts of SF (e.g. large post-industrial spaces in SoMa, Liz's apartment appears to be the rather posh Russian Hill, etc.) and when there are scenes on the street they make sense in terms of where the characters would be traveling to/from."

boardgames,fef1f1s,t1_feenmmx,1579045912.0,One of the best CCGs ever released. It offered far more in the way of gameplay than most with a more board game sort of style.
boardgames,fef18dp,t1_feexcr7,1579045787.0,"That's always the problem with any game or series, regardless of the medium. The hardcore lifestyle fans want tons of content released at a rapid pace. The rest of us can barely keep up because we have other interests."
AnimalsBeingBros,fee6gzd,t1_fedw5b6,1579027389.0,"The horse didn't have a bond with anyone. It was all about his fixation on the horses. More to the point, the horse was a combination of god and projection of his troubled relationship with his father. That's before we even get into his complex sexual issues."
worldnews,fee5gia,t1_fedz9ce,1579026789.0,"Idioms can generally be learned from context or usage. The harder part is explaining references. While you can learn some from repeated use it's often a much longer process.

Idioms are pretty easy. We all learn them contextually with many not even making literal sense to native speakers or facing obvious origins. We just repeat them as set phrases."
pcmasterrace,fee4029,t1_fee13ys,1579025926.0,"I am, but oddly enough it's not even a mechanical keyboard. Just a cheap, pack-in board from an old PC that's lasted an absurdly long time. Gaming, school, daily work as a programmer... this thing has lasted for 25 years of being used for hours every single day. I wouldn't be surprised if it's seen 50,000 hours of use. The only damage is that the printing on the ""s"" is slightly worn off on the bottom half.

I keep meaning to replace it with a Model M reproduction or another high quality buckling spring keyboard, but it's one of those things I've never quite gotten around to. I might not have much of a choice soon. The AT to ATX adapter is annoying enough and pretty soon I'll probably have to throw a USB one on there as well."
