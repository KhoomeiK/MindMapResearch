Pathetic. John Roberts is a young, inexperienced, Justice. He actually had to ask the question, 'Is he allowed to object?' when the white house council objected to the 10th amendment to not be read out loud. Trump's lawyer objected, and the Chief Justice had to ask a clerk if he was allowed to object. And of course he wasn't. A senator then woke up and objected the motion."
The_Mueller,ff8jdzp,t1_ff8ecws,1579681228.0,"Trump was impeached. You mean convicted in the Senate. He won't be convicted in the Senate because it has a majority of Republicans. 

And why is that? Why would all the Republicans not want to hear any evidence and vote to aquite Trump? Could it be because they are all guilty of a crime as well? Perhaps a foreign government infiltrating the NRA with money, having that money laundered through the non profit, and given to the RNC. The RNC which was being run by Trump's campaign manager. The same campaign manager who is serving 4 years in jail for... You guessed it, illegal campaign contribution to Trump through the payment of a loan on his house to pay off a porn star that Trump cheated on his wife who had a 4 month old baby.
