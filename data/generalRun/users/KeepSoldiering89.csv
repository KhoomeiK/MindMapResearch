SuicideWatch,feqwzje,t3_epwvfr,1579347009.0,"Hey chief a small recommendation for you to consider,cognitive behavioral therapy. Essentially you go about the slow process of changing they way you think and react. I know it sounds somewhat stupid but IMO it works. Essentially you train yourself to have different/positive thoughts. So when you would normally react by using a self demeaning comment you would use something more understanding and you would also begin to generally change your attitude and thought patterns by repetition . Just something to look into to"
SuicideWatch,feqvjf1,t3_eqdwch,1579346548.0,"Try to see if you could get in, if you did that could be perfect for you new people and a new environment would most likely help you. However if you don’t that doesn’t mean it’s the end of the world. Plus kindness is not always expectant of a reward. While yes you can break down basically all human interactions to how someone benefits but not everything must be extrinsic when it comes to kindness. There are those who help others because it is the right thing to do whether it be because they do so for religion or because they’re a nice person. For example going onto this sub reddit to try to help others isn’t to benefit or gain something but rather to help someone through a trying time in their life. Maybe you could find solace in trying to prove that assumption wrong to spread happiness and kindness selflessly to prove there are those out their who want to help other and be kind because it’s right"
SuicideWatch,fequdgo,t3_eqdd6r,1579346073.0,I know it would be hard partner to open to those close to you and around you but if you have people that you know truly care about you then you should open up to them and tell them how you’re feeling they may end up understanding and being able to help.
SuicideWatch,feqrq39,t3_eq5g3y,1579345252.0,I’m sorry partner that your path has lead you to a point like this but like every road there are bumps and divots. You just got to keep soldiering through it and with time and effort I think you can achieve it. Plus you can make this your goal to achieve to find people who care for you and people to love in return. To acquiesce due to a rough patch and to sacrifice what could be is unwise press on my friend. Should you choose to press on which I believe you should find a hobby something to devote your time to that can help you find enjoyment and stay busy. By doing this it will give you less time to dwell on the bad in life. The other great thing about a hobby is that you can integrate yourself into a community and make friends and allow you to meet new people. If you work for it happiness is achievable

AmItheAsshole,fdv5c5q,t3_en0zfr,1578743359.0,"YTA~ let me say it is very irresponsible for your daughter to be texting and driving and it isn’t safe for everyone even if a majority of us do it from time to time. I respect that you care for your daughter and want to protect her safety but I think that you went to far. First up you just put a wedge in you and your daughters relationship. You just took away a teenagers freedom, made getting to work significantly harder if not impossible and have now have ostracized her from her friends. Second you should have consulted her mother before doing something this drastic you chose to make a major change in your daughters life that will also effect her mother. Third, this punishment in my opinion should have been a few months long but not only is she out 200 bucks she’s unable to legally drive for 2 years. So for two years you’ve made her the friend that always needs a ride or she’s going to drive illegally and put herself in further jealousy. I believe that you wanted to do what was best for your daughter but you were rash and over did it without thinking"

If you knew he was drunk driver why did you allow him to pick you up in the first place, if you knew he was drunk why didn’t you drive or refuse the ride. It obviously didn’t bother you enough or seem to endanger your safety to the point you refused the ride. If you knew he had done this before why didn’t you call an Uber. Instead of having a sit down talk with this dude the first time you to let this guy get a massive ticket a night in jail and he will lose his license.
