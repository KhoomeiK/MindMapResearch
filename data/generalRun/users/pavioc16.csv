Way back when I first started driving, when I first got gas I freaked out at a ""Pending"" charge that was in ADDITION to the money I had paid for gas for a card.

I didn't understand that merchants didn't get the money right away for a while, that came later when it was actually explained to me, but I understood the basic concept that transactions took some time to process... Why else would there be ""pending"" charges?"

We ended up giving them the 10% discount that does apply to even parties like that, but whatever manager was trying to be nice and they typically give a 10% discount to the immediate family of employees, just it was kinda ridiculous they wanted 50% off for a 19-top.

They all tipped terribly, including the hostess. The server went to the manager and the manager actually talked to the hostess and said that especially after getting a discount not tipping well to your coworker was not OK...

Like my employee card still works there and I get 50% off my togo orders, and I literally tip that 50%. Why not? Food is usually $10 anyways, so it's a $5 tip!

But the labor I cost is so cheap, and servers make up the majority of crew members... If all our wages tripled over night, that $10 would not go up to $12.

If it was only $2.13, serving would be much more iffy. I support the tipped minimum wage being raised to at least $5/hr to provide that cushion in other states, and to reflect cost of living.

But let's look at some stats.

> According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, waitresses earned a mean hourly wage nationally of $11.73 in 2016. The highest 10 percent made $18.49/hour, and the lowest earned $8.22/hour. Mean is the average of all workers' wages. The monthly median wage for the top 10 percent is $3,205, while the bottom 10 percent brought home $1,424. Median means half of the workers earned less than this amount, and half of the workers earned more.

-  https://work.chron.com/much-money-average-waitress-make-per-month-22289.html

As in, the lowest still makes more than the federal minimum wage. And remember, it's custom for the majority of tipped workers to underreport cash tips, so this estimate is lower than actual, in all probability.

Also, my States relatively higher tipped minimum wage, which is still not at $7.25/hr, makes it much easier to reach that median, and not too difficult to reach the top 10% if you choose to work at the right place. I've heard the State I work in is great for servers..."
unpopularopinion,fe8qepg,t1_fe8n4k4,1578929259.0,">Tipping enables discrimination towards waiters and of different colors or sex. It allows the customer to use their tip as a power dynamic to either sexually harass their female waiter, or to reinforce a racist mentality they have. 

This is the only argument against tipping I accept. Better HR and better management is the answer, though.

>Waiters can also discriminate. Let’s say a few teens go into a pretty nice restaurant and the waiter thinks “oh these guys aren’t gonna tip, I’m not gonna keep my focus on them”. 

Bad servers do this. I don't, and as a result that group of teens is more likely to tip me well. As a rule of thumb, the servers where I worked that discriminated SUCKED. I had a black woman and her daughter request me all the time and treat me very well... Got her into one of our better drinks! She loved me, and she loved Hennessy. Was a great exchange that I wouldn't be motivated to provide if there was no tip involved.

>If the waiter made a livable wage and didn’t rely on tips, they would treat their customers equal in order to keep their job. 

Just like they do in fast-food, where management was paid just above that livable wage, and so most workers provided equally bare-minimum service to everyone with no consequences. Sure some people ran circles around them, but they were the minority and they'd get overworked and resentful.

I worked at McDicks and I get bare minimum there, for the same prices my restaurant can afford to give because they pay me 1/3 what they earn.

>And like I said before, wage is not certain. Waiters can be paid as little as $2.13. With most places dividing their tips amongst their servers. Meaning even the worst server is getting just as much in tips as the best server. 

Most is an exaggeration. I'm job hunting right now and I won't work in a pooled restaurant... I'm not having a hard time finding restaurants because tip-pooling isn't even really the norm. Tipping out is, but that's different.

Part of the attractiveness of tipping is that my wage goes up and down based on how hard I work... 

>Tipping is just a way for employers to make more and blame it on the working class for their employees not making enough

So, I went to a crappy Italian place last night with a guy. We left the girl $4, which was about 20%... $3 of that was me. The girl had one other table that was probably the same. That was it. If you include the States tipped minimum wage, her combined wage was about 1.5x the States minimum wage. She didn't look unhappy, because she wasn't working hard at all.

Pretty much the only time you don't make minimum is if you don't even get guests... with that $2.13 an hour, you just need one tip of $5 and you're pretty much at federal minimum. And again... You work less, you get paid less. I think it's a fair deal, much more fair than a crappy ""livable"" wage."

Again, where I work the minimum wage is soon gonna be 3x as much as my States tipped minimum wage... at three times the labor cost, you would most certainly be paying my new and lower wage, at a level that would properly account for servers being that much more expensive to my boss.

Where I work my restaurant can afford ridiculously cheap deals and lunch combos that you can easily pay across the street at McDicks, because my labor is 33% as much as the average McDicks worker.

The reason fast-casual sit-down restaurants can be so cheap is because of tips... $8 lunch combos? Two meals for $25? That would not be a thing. The restaurants in Europe not only provide crappier service, but like most everything in Europe, it's much more expensive... you pay more for less!"

I'm talking about being helpful and actually crafting an experience for your guests... Where you try to get your guest what they want and provide the level of service they indicated to you. 

You look at fast-food or grocery store clerks, and sure you get some good workers... but you also get a lot of shit.

To use a recent example, I quite literally helped get a sexist coworker fired because he treated a female coworker terribly. On the other hand, a bartender I work with has occasionally expressed ignorant views, but he treats everyone the same... I get along with him just fine and I corrected him about some of the shit he was saying about LGBT folk... We even went out for a drink.

>As for ""sinking to their level"" if someone's out there ordering gay people killed, I'd be happy to put a bullet in their head. I'd rather stop the problem than nobly try to convince Putin gay people are OK while we're butchered in Chechnya. 

An extreme example that has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. I'm talking about everyday human beings having different views, not genocide or murder.

>Working class people like myself lean left...
That used to be true, but there's been a wave of right-wing populism that's pretty much world-wide, from the Philippines, to Poland and Hungary, to the UK, to Brazil, to Germany, to France... the list goes on and on. At some point you can't blame the leaders. These are all Democratic countries, and the majority of everyone in these countries is working class. The middle-class isn't as big in general. As a whole, the working class is moving to the right, otherwise over a dozen countries wouldn't be voting out the left and voting in the right.

> I will not compromise on those issues, I will insult and condescend to bigots.

That's your choice. You choose how you react to people. It's an understandable reaction, one I can sympathize with, but it causes harm. But I'm not going to change your mind and you aren't going to change mine... it is what it is"
lgbt,fdnp1mp,t1_fdly431,1578590221.0,"I think it's obvious you are angry, but you aren't seeing my point. You aren't seeing my friends and coworkers and people I interact with every day as human beings, but you're reducing them to caricatures you can hate.

I'll bring up the example of the girl who was anti-immigrant, pro-torture and my best friend in high school. This was a sweet girl, incredibly depressed though, that was emotionally abused by her family... She honestly tried to do the best she could for other people. But when I told her I didn't support torture, she responded, ""What, so you support terrorists over innocent people? I'd rather they get tortured if that saves lives.""

And while I disagreed with that point, and you may argue agreeing with torture made her a bad person, I'd argue that this was just one facet of her personality... EVERYONE is good and bad and reducing people to only bad immediately only harms yourself, because then there's no chance for meaningful change.

I also really do believe the oppressed should be held to higher standards, because you shouldn't want to debase yourself by lowering yourself to the tactics that were used against us... We were demonized, called perverts, people used to say they wouldn't let me babysit their kids, blah blah blah all that shit... And yes, personally, I held myself to a higher standard.

That didn't mean when people actively discriminated against me I would just sit down and accept it... when someone told me they didn't support same-sex marriage, I wouldn't be aggressive, but I'd ask, ""Why the hell does it matter to you if I get married? Don't come to the wedding then!"" When a kid yelled ""f/*/*got"" at me, I yelled back ""fucking asshole!"" I got up during one of those dumb school assemblies on bullying and said bullying on the basis of being gay was unacceptable.

And I AM angry at people who see black & white because I truly believe that the reason that all across Europe and Americas there's this huge wave of right-wing populism that is actively harming people is directly tied to the mostly working-class population that is on the fence with these views, or growing up surrounded by people that are more right then not, just being completely demonized. There's the not unfair feeling that they are being looked down upon by the left-wing for their views, and they don't feel represented by the left anymore, and so the right found an in and now every year in the news I hear about yet another right-wing party coming into power in Europe or South America! 

I have a varied cultural background and now EVERY country I trace my heritage to has lurched to the right, even Brazil which was devastated by the right-wing military dictatorship! I'm no political scientist, but I think it's a reasonable hypothesis that it can be traced back to a disillusioned working class that feels insulted and condescended to by the left-wing..."
books,fdltt5s,t3_eltzva,1578532329.0,"I really enjoyed The Song of Achilles and Circe by Madeleine Miller. Both are retellings of the Iliad and the Odyssey from the points of view of more ""minor"" characters or characters whose motivations are not traditionally explored. I've read books like this before, and they can go either way in terms of quality, but I couldn't put either of these down! I didn't know anything about Patrocles, but the story as told from his POV was extremely compelling. Same with Circe, which I actually enjoyed even more.

I read quite a lot, and it's been a while since I couldn't put a book down... Both were recommended to all my aunts at Christmas!"
lgbt,fdlrme4,t1_fdlq70x,1578530846.0,"I'll agree to disagree with you. I do think it's kinda sad that you think many of the people I interact with are bad people just because of the views they have, but I realize that's not an unusual opinion anymore. Empathy for different viewpoints is not a usual thing anymore, and it kinda sucks because I think one of the ways that the LGBT community gained our rights was from people simply coming out to friends and family who were, for the most part, against same-sex marriage and the like, and then showing these people we are just human beings.

Now it's all about demonizing the other side... It's all black & white. It kinda makes me afraid for the future, because in the end we are all human and flawed, and the best way to get people to recognize that is not too scream & shout and call them terrible people for their beliefs, but to simply educate them by showing them that LGBT people, immigrants, and people of color are simply people going through the same shit they are... I've seen it happen myself... a very conservative friend became liberal and stopped being so anti-immigrant simply by hanging out at my house and around my family. She wasn't a bad person, just misguided.

It's dangerous to reduce people to their views... I feel like a huge part of the backlash across the world, a big lurch against civil rights and to right-wing populism, is from people being sick of being told their terrible people and becoming defensive... People tend to radicalize when they become defensive. And now I live in the world of Bolsonaro, Trump & Boris Johnson... and I feel like Trump could win his next term to."
lgbt,fdlob50,t1_fdln5xz,1578528589.0,"Didn't consider the LGBT marriage thing. In my original comment it's not stated out right but my friend doesn't support same-sex marriage. That one doesn't automatically make you a bad person.

US interests aren't always the best... I have Brazilian heritage, trust me, I know. But it was sort of his job? And nothing we are discussing here is like what leaders in other countries do that make them truly despicable... This guy is just misled and possibly just not really smart, not actively a dick.

Plenty of good people support the Patriot Act. Again, because you can have what are, in my opinion, fucked up views, but not be a bad person. They think it's what is needed to keep themselves safe...

Maybe it might help for context that I live in a pretty conservative town so I've interacted and been friends with plenty of conservatives that have been pro-torture, anti-immigrant, you name it... but would also be generally good people. And most of those views come from fear and ignorance, and a desire to keep themselves and their families safe, which is understandable."
lgbt,fdlmi1y,t1_fdlm120,1578527377.0,"Neither of us were in his position. I don't know whether he's a bad guy or not, but I give him the benefit of the doubt in thinking he may have actually thought he was doing what was best for American interests. Remember, the vote to approve the war was bipartisan.

Everything I've heard about him apart from the War on Terror doesn't rub me the wrong way, like I've heard about OTHER politicians that seem to suggest they are only in it for themselves.

I'm not saying he ISN'T a bad person, just that there isn't enough there to say he is... just that he has fundamentally different beliefs about what is right for the Country."
lgbt,fdlimys,t1_fdjq9il,1578524844.0,"Listen, I actually was friends in high school with a very conservative Christian guy who believes the earth was 6000 years old. I had discussions with a girl who tried to suggest I go to an ex-gay camp, which is BTW a HORRIBLE place (she specifically linked Exodus International) and we had a discussion which ended with her thanking me for being so polite and backing off... I still think I might've planted the seed to change that girls views later on but we didn't keep up with each other.

That is how you change people's views... not by demonizing, but by trying to empathize, and then to educate. And if they become an asshole, THEN you shut them down.

And yes, I do think GWB was essentially demonized... I don't agree with his politics but he isn't the Antichrist. I'd be polite if I, for some incomprehensible reason, was at an event with him... He doesn't seem like a bad guy just not the brightest POTUS we had, and Cheney and Rove mixed in with that was a mess."
