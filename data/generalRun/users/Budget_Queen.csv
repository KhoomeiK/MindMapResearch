personalfinance,ff9hhtp,t3_esdj83,1579713122.0,"Your university didn't ghost you, your professor did.

As much as it sucks, it sounds like you only contacted one guy and all via email. When I was having trouble with my classes, I sent an email. No response, so 48 hours later I made a phone call. Only slightly helpful. Then I contacted multiple other people throughout the department and got my answers.

It sucks but especially with big schools you have to take things into your own hands. If you don't get an answer within a reasonable amount of time, escalate, just like you would for any other business."

IdiotsInCars,ff1vk5l,t3_er3fmu,1579487143.0,"I remember once as a young driver I made the poor decision to merge right in front of a truck, thinking my pos car could somehow accelerate enough to outrun it and totally misjudging the entire situation.

AskDocs,ff1sswt,t3_er1n52,1579485385.0,"NAD but have dated a few men with this issue. Do some reading on PIED (porn induced ED). You may think that the fetish videos aren't affecting your sex life, but it's possible you've wired yourself to associate the fetish with orgasm rather than ""vanilla"" in person sex with orgasm. Also look into death grip or other ways you may be desensitizing yourself. Otherwise, a doctor visit may be in order. Good luck!"
IdiotsInCars,ff1se5r,t1_fez6m6m,1579485127.0,"I grew up without a dad. I was never taught how to maintain a car, or that it even needed maintenence. I always set up an appointment if a light goes on, but I do the bare minimum to keep it running. I know no other way. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot if girls' dads did the maintenance themselves without saying anything or teaching their daughters, so the girls grow up to be women who think the cars sort themselves out somehow."

niceguys,fekzrc6,t1_fekefzl,1579210995.0,"As I always say, never block crazy. If she had blocked him, then he escalated to following her, then where would she be? Better to find out who he is, keep him unblocked so you know if he says something like *hey I'm going to stop by to see you "", then report report report."

justlegbeardthings,fduv7a9,t3_emsebb,1578739363.0,"I think the added ""tree sexism"" may have been a joke.

In my town, they prefer to plant trees under electrical wires, then trim them every year until they look like deformed horror movie tree corpses.

Edit : Read tweets. Not satire. But amazing how many people assume that towns don't want to plant trees that create fruit because they ""don't want to give people free food."" Or maybe it's because fruit rots and attracts bugs?... No way, it's definitely the other thing."

If I had known the other option was to say all men are awful and blame everyone else, I would have saved myself a whole lot of time reading and money on books!"
