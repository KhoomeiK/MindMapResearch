I don't own that laptop so I cannot say for certain, but ideally you would want as much heat going from the CPU and GPU to the headsink. That would mean that technically, increasing thermal conductivity between CPU heatpipe and GPU heatpipe would be better overall. 

A lot of older designs had 2 heatpipes and 1 for CPU and 1 for GPU, but most newer designs have 2 pipes shared between both CPU and GPU, which I assume is better.
