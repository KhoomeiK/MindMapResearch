National healthcare is cheaper for everybody, you dope, the only people that lose out there are the private corporations. When you pay into private health insurance, you're paying for when everyone else with your insurance company has to use it, plus profit for the insurance company. When you get taxed for public healthcare, which literally everyone would (should) be doing, you're paying for when everyone else has to use it, without an insurance company profiting. That coupled with prices being more fixed sounds solid to me. Now you may think that private corporations, whose only true goal is to milk as much money out of you as possible, may handle health insurance better, but I'm more ready to believe the government has it in their best interest to keep me healthy so I can be productive.

If there were stricter enforcement of the current tax codes, paying for national healthcare wouldn't really even be a question anymore. 

Publicly funded higher education results in a more well educated populace who then by all rights should have higher earning potential while also being more valuable as citizens overall. This of course would help increase GDP per capita across the board."
