I can not say it will be all good or you will be extremely happy somehow.

But you are fighting and you have written this because you did not give up because you needed the relief I think.

If you want to talk about it more I will surely listen. If you dont, I just want to say that my hopes were my everything when i was  in really hard pain. I slept with them, woke up with them, cried and screamed with them. But without them i would be dead by my hands. Never lose them please."
