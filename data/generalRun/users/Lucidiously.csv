The plank shield is indeed pretty useless, and it has a shield bash instead of a parry. Some shields can be used to parry, other will have a bash or allow you to use your weapon art when one-handing, it will be in the description of the shield.

Small shields are better at parrying than medium shields as they have a bigger parry window and the buckler, target and small leather shield are the best for this. Also certain weapons, most notably fists&claws, can parry when equipped in the left hand."

Now I don't have too much hope that those who post on gendercritical will actually change their beliefs on transgender people, especially since any dissenting voice is quickly shut down.

Got a source for that?

The ancient Greeks, Egyptians and Mesopotamians didn't have a taboo against it or even viewed it as beneficial. And while we do not know their exact views on it there are depictions of masturbation from even earlier in history.

It being taboo seems to mostly stem from a Judeo-Christian viewpoint where it's seen as sinful because sperm is wasted instead of used for procreation. Even in the major religions there are varying schools of thought that range from ""it's absolutely taboo"" to ""it's wasteful but allowed"".

The more modern taboo against masturbation we get  from the 18th & 19th century and the puritanical attitude at the time. Many of their views on sex are nowadays generally regarded as backwards and sometimes even harmful.

I'm not trying to say masturbation is good or bad, and nothing should be done in excess, but to say that there's come worldwide consensus that it's taboo is just not true."
