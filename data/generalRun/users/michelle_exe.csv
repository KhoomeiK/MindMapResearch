I had a couple of tests done there and nothing showed up in the lab results so I was referred to another, larger hospital with a OBGYN ward and had an ultrasound and vaginal exam that confirmed the massive cyst. I was admitted and had surgery the next day because the weight of the cyst twisted my fallopian tube, which stopped the blood flow (that's what caused the pain) and could've resulted in having to have the whole ovary and tube removed if I had waited any longer.

Many high ranking members of the nazi party were Austrians and approximately 10% of the population (700,000 people) were registered members.

relationship_advice,fdr0z21,t1_fdqz1oh,1578678003.0,"I'm sorry but 'don't force your dick into my mouth while I'm asleep and hold me down after I say no' seems like a boundary that doesn't really need to be set unless you expect your partner to be a rapist. You don't need further personal details to believe someone when they say they were assaulted, you fucking weirdo. You'd believe someone if they said a stranger beat them up, believe sexual assault victims too ffs"

relationship_advice,fdqy7w3,t1_fdqxoxx,1578676618.0,It's not different in the sense of needing consent before you try to put you dick into someones mouth. You people have literally no understanding of consent. It doesn't matter that they were in a relationship. Consent isn't something you get once and keep forever ffs
relationship_advice,fdqxxfk,t1_fdqx38u,1578676441.0,"Your sexuality is irrelevant to the scenario. The point is that after the trauma and humiliation of having someone try to force themself onto you, (again, LITERALLY ATTEMPTED ASSAULT, not a 'cringe moment'), you don't owe your assailant shit, no matter what your relationship was previously. They don't respect your bodily autonomy, your decision to say no and, quite frankly, you as a human being. 

Also, nice little bit of homophobia you sprinkled in there."
relationship_advice,fdqwaht,t1_fdqv99c,1578675733.0,"That's not a 'cringe moment'. It's literally (attempted) assault. If your buddy tried to force his dick into your mouth while you were asleep, and after you tell him no tried to hold you down, you'd probably not sit down and talk it out and happily continue to be friends because it was just a little 'cringe moment', regardless of how close your friendship was beforehand. Stop trivialising assault"
