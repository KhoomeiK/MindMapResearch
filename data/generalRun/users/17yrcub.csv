Great wholesome post though."
ExNoContact,fex6euh,t3_eql4m0,1579425288.0,I blocked her but I do miss her every day.
SuicideWatch,fehnoub,t1_fehig28,1579120234.0,I don't really open up to individuals because I'm scared of being a burden. But thanks.
offmychest,fe1er8x,t1_fe1en7m,1578825688.0,"Not at the beginning, but it developed into it eventually."
offmychest,fe1cpxb,t1_fe1ckc4,1578825113.0,A breakup.
offmychest,fdr5iwk,t1_fdr4f5u,1578679721.0,"I have told my family about the way I feel for a long time. My dad ends up getting mad because he's lost so many friends to suicide. My mother doesn't understand and thinks it can be fixed by her giving a motivational speech, then she gets angry when I don't improve. My brother says he'd be ""annoyed"" if I did it."
AskTeenGirls,fdhyi44,t1_fdhskhy,1578432479.0,I found one. I'll find another. Thanks for the luck man
askteenboys,fdhr91a,t3_elat9a,1578428608.0,"First off, I don't care if other people do it. 

Here's why I don't do it.

1. My father used to come home drunk and was abusive when I was small, so I associate alcohol with that and I don't want to become that. For the record, he's a very good dad now.

2. My father used to be in a gang and I saw a lot of people get into a lot of trouble because of drugs.

3. A certain amount of alcohol will remove inhibitions. I get suicidal intentions often and I don't want to act on them when I've got no self control.


However, I do have an interest in psychedelics and hallucinogenic. I haven't done them yet but I plan to try mushrooms as I know where I can get some."
AskTeenGirls,fdhqks1,t1_fdhq7tv,1578428218.0,Honestly if a girl was humming to herself and looking lost in her thoughts with a smile I'd probably fall in love right there.
AskTeenGirls,fdgywyp,t1_fdgrh9t,1578411694.0,Been to multiple and none have been able to help but thanks
AskTeenGirls,fdf31zo,t1_fdf2ysf,1578352174.0,I've had these for over three years now and they've not faded. But I don't mind.
AskTeenGirls,fdf0wtb,t1_fdf0jyq,1578350808.0,"Kinda same here.

When mine were new they were a deep, purple colour and were way more visible. When I first showed my ex she took a few seconds and then said that I look like a tiger."
MomForAMinute,fbyeduk,t1_fbxrdcf,1577214794.0,I don't really know how to thank you properly but I appreciate it. I won't say anything just yet. I don't want to ruin Christmas. But I will stick around and say something.
