Blacklabs,ffgdx45,t3_etguql,1579904077.0,So handsome!!! What a perfect looking Lab.

Edmonton,ff04isn,t3_eqwfij,1579465135.0,So fucking spot on!!!! The spirit of the 80's really got me. Edmonton and its obsession with the 80's and classic rock is proof the 80's weren't just a decade but a state of mind.

facepalm,fdxyd8g,t1_fac00ds,1578774191.0,"I believe Texas can. They were a separate Country before being absorbed into the US. If the US government shuts down for a certain amount of time they are legally allowed to separate. Like last year when the government shut down and air controllers were working for free. Texas could have left. They have their own power grid, massive military bases, oil, ports and big population..."

alberta,fdehp1w,t3_ekx0qu,1578339253.0,"While I agree with this article, before we go green and holier than thou ethical. Please educate yourselves on how batteries are made. Electric vehicles are not the answer and are not green, not in the slightest. Take a look at the ecological disaster of open pit lithium, cobalt, cadmium, nickle etc mines. Then understand most are in third world countries with no safety standards. Workers die in droves to mine this toxic material thus creating a massive amount of human suffering. Then also understand we have very little infrastructure to deal with or properly recycle those batteries. So when your electric or hybrid cars battery craps itself in 5 years it likely goes to the dump where it leaches nasty heavy metals into the ground. I'm fully on board for green energy and renewable resources. But first understand the entire impact of your technology before saying it's the answer. Research into better batteries is needed to make electric vehicles more sustainable."

AskReddit,fckcja4,t1_fcjha4b,1577722262.0,They contracted the Canadian company Avro Aero ( hope I spelled that right ) to make them. The videos of them flying are pretty funny.

guns,fc9s2kv,t3_egr212,1577557365.0,I think inland manufacturing made some. And ithica made some as well. Or for a less authentic version literally buy any pump action 12ga and put wood furniture and a heat shield on it. Get a Mossberg 590A1 if you want a bayonet. It uses a M9 bayonet so if you own a AR15 with bayonet lug you can use it on two guns.

canadaguns,fc6ltw7,t3_eg64qz,1577483621.0,"Great gun. I have two and absolutely love them. Action gets buttery smooth after about 300ish rounds. Federal blue box 170gr round nose bullets printed 1.5"" at 100 yards every time for me. Welcome to the family and enjoy your new family member!"
canadaguns,fc5od81,t3_eg20bj,1577462590.0,"Beautiful rifle, Lee Enfield fan boy here. Great rifles and even better as a carbine. I have a bubba'd carbine  with brass butt plate and the kick isn't that bad. About 30-06 levels. Builds character. That's a old warhorse and nothing would make it happier than to be shot. Paying homage to your grandfather while doing so is the best thing I've heard today. Enjoy"
