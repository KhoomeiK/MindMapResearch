This is typically spit onto the ground or in a container**, because swallowing the saliva-tobacco mixture can cause irritation to the esophagus and induce nausea and vomiting.

And no.. no buddy, it was never answered. Fortunately for you, you must never have put a dip of tobacco in your mouth before.. loose leaf, from a can. It is made to putt the product in your lip, saliva is formed, and you are supposed to spit it. Thats why ""spitoons"" exist. Look it up. You'll learn something about history.

Its definitely your fault my friend... because everyone in the world understands it except you. But thats why you are here. To argue and troll... or hide that your product doesnt work.

Waist:hip ratio, preference for balanced faces, possibly larger eyes, what men subconsciously look at, that doesn't change.

While people will point the the Venus of Willendorf or other old totems as indicators of preferred beauty standards, we in reality are just guessing there and little evidence exists that that kind of body was a ""turn-on"" on preferred.  Just as there's little indication that runway models of today are top preferred body style - though Victorias Secret models have typically been built with more curves than most runway models.
