My major issue is their coyness in it all.
Like no one is going to ask them outright someday.
One thing I’ve noticed is that the people like this tend to give off the “I’m better than you” vibe.
I’ve never got that that vibe from anyone else except the child of a family that has had their bank handled by their father/mother.
It’s like they haven’t accomplished anything so they just prop themselves up as the next best thing, all the while struggling like the rest to figure out how all these bills that have now doubled are affordable.
A decade ago I was paying half the rent that I do now.
All my bills were 50% less. 
When that subject comes up and the freeloaders pipe up “your rent should be 1/3 of your monthly.” Like it’s some formula that was explained to them by bank of mommy and daddy and that all housing is the same.

I’m a bit jaded at how many jackasses get to start and fail businesses while still getting paid by their parents for showing up for a couple of hours.
Last pay cheque I saw of a son of business owner, it was $5,000 for a week.
All he did was answer the phones while the manager was on the floor and grab lunch, then right after home time at 2:30. Pathetic little bitch of a man.

I have no respect for children of business owners, most of the time they’re disrespectful, and when they’re not, they are still soaking up capitalism in all its essence without a single thought to the damage their families are adding. Little empires."

Most of the people conflicted in this thread are because they are willing to live in conflict with their personal beliefs.

Also, financial stability means nothing when you’re spending your alone time with some person of the same sex, more than likely spending money on them and the family at the same time.

This works out just like a heterosexual person realizing that they don’t get along with their partner just the same.
Loads of people get married out of fear they’ll be alone forever. Hell, my parents generation made a culture out of it. These days out of 5 close friends, 2/5  of our parents are divorced. 
What’s even crazier is that they act like it’s not a big deal and never really deal with it. They just move away from the people they knew and pretend like life was always like that.
I’m sad for the boomers some times, they’re a completely wild and desperate generation.
They had everything but couldn’t figure out how to have culture where being honest with each other was worth it."
