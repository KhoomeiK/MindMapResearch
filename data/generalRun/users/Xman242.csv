Clemson,fercznk,t1_feq58ro,1579352471.0,"He had 207 total rushes this year, but the most under Dabo according to CFB Reference is 282 in 2015 by Wayne Gallman. That's about 19 carries a game, 2 fewer than Taylor averaged in Wisconsin this season.

Wiscy's 2nd leading rusher has half the offense our 2nd and 3rd leading rushers have *a piece*, leading to that depth and experience that's helped us get to 3 of 4 title games. 

But people still wanna give Etienne the ball 20+ times a game and break him before he gets into the league. I don't get it. It's not just the playoffs I hear this complaint, it's during the regular season too."
