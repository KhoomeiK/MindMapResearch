WhitePeopleTwitter,fgtqy92,t1_fgtq08a,1581108149.0,"I grew up in a trailer park, surrounded by tobacco fields. There was no one who didn’t hunt. My brother is a professional gunsmith. My first gun was a .410 single shot shotgun.  This is how a know the whole “hUnTerS arE CoNserVationisTs” trope is not true for the vastttttttt majority of them."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fgt0qws,t1_fgszchi,1581096637.0,"Lol why are you upset, I’m not even sure what point you’re refuting or trying to make. What I’m saying is that hunting historically has not been some harmless pastime centered around conservation efforts. We hunted countless animals to extinction or endangerment and many many hunters themselves resisted the modern regulations that make hunting less harmful. I know plenty of hunters, and the one who were around decades ago fought tooth and nail against modern hunting regulations."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fgsz8kw,t1_fgsykt2,1581095738.0,"Oh I realize that many current hunting regulations are not harmful and can even be helpful for some species, but that’s a recent development. Historically over-hunting has decimated countless species of wildlife. Oh and it was many hunters who fought tooth and nail against implementing the regulations that are in place today. So yeah, cry me a river."
