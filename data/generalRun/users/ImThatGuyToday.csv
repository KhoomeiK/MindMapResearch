Alright if the evidence presented by the recent hearings have no meaning to you, how about his actions?

So you find it fair Trump is earning taxpayer money directly as President? 

You find it right that he's unilaterally taken military action that's created international blowback?

That he says women are something to grab by the pussy? That he incites childish name calling and rhetoric instead of facts?

Here is where your argument is flawed. You keep using the word ""accusation"". I am not accusing anyone.

I'm stating public record. You seem to have the rules of debate conflated. This isn't new or unknown, it's a well discussed and documented subject in politics.

Similar to how you don't source the outlines for time or gravity in science. It's a common topic in the subject.

You're not asking me to source and you're incorrectly using ""accusation"". You're asking me to teach you politics, not debate or argue."

Yes, I will add to this that receiving public records can be a lengthy and tedious process. Although they could be made available online (what other aggregation websites do), our government works off a request system. It makes it more difficult to analyze the information in a short time period.

However we have many transparency laws and protections built into our government."

You seem to misunderstand. You say it as validating my accusations, when you've asked me to source available public record. I made a common sense statement noted from public record, not an accusation. As it's not an argument or point of conflict. You're asking me to go above and beyond a common political topic.

I could, but we're talking decades of public records over numerous politicians. One in my own state was McConnell regarding digital voting booths after receiving lobbyists donations. Publicly available and announced."

Submissions for majority of taxes could be set as easily as reviewing the IRS completed taxes and approving. Currently this is prevented so that methods like the ones you listed can exist.

As noted from your above examples, creating an entirely unnecessary market.

>Loopholes exists, if you're a small business it's even easier to use them to your advantage.

As someone who files business taxes, this is untrue. If you have a particular code loophole, please source it as you would be the first.

>If they did simplify the tax code I'd hope it'd be in a way where I pay less or the same with the same amount going to charity. I just dont see it happening.

This could easily be done, exactly as you would like. Again, we could simplify our convoluted tax code and it would still be a complex tax code."

I think I see the issue. You're talking about the tax code itself, I'm talking about our ability to easily submit taxes without a middle-man. Alongside lobbying to complicate the tax code is lobbying to allow companies like Turbo-Tax and HR block to exist in markets in which the IRS already completes or has nearly 90% of the necessary information to file your taxes. Often preventing free, or more convenient submissions. We've had a little movement forward lately but still not as easy as it can be. The UK I just review my taxes and submit, often without a single adjustment.

You are speaking of the tax code itself. A complicated tax code is not beneficial. Actually, currently the tax code helps prevent small businesses, which is not beneficial to a country.

I think you mean comprehensive tax code, not complicated. In this case our tax code is more than complicated, it's convoluted. Unnecessarily complex for no other reason than to allow larger companies tax loopholes."

You label these as politicians. I call them humans who obtained this position. You are correct, people of greed and desire of control seek out these positions, but seem to misunderstand our current position.

It was due to previous generations doing the same, and not caring about politics that allowed these people to have these positions. We cannot blame the politicians without blaming the people.

I do blame the American people for the position we are in, at least a large majority, as most knew very little about politics and have been forced to learn the basics due to recent events.

>to be so convinced that your ideas are better than the next guys

A real decision is built objectively. Like every decision you will need confidence in it, but we've had politicians who built decisions based upon logic, research, and evidence. Rarer today, but they still exist.

>The idea that politicians represent us is a lie

This is incorrect, or at least poorly phrased. The idea that a politician may lie is known, the objective that a politician is designed to represent us is fact. We are a republic and built upon representatives."

To remove them from the middle does not require your suggestions. I'm honestly not sure where you're coming from as it seems you're trying to re-invent the tax laws themselves instead of the subject on these middle-man tax companies.

>Like I said it's not black and white. There is good and bad with a complicated tax code.

That's not difficult at all, I understand the tax code from both personal and business perspectives as I have to file each year. I'm just confused as to where you're coming from, as it it seems irrelevant and like we are having two different conversations.
