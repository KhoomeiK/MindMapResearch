Fios,ffjuxby,t3_eu0u24,1580007640.0,"I only had 7 months left on my contract, but several different discounts.   I chatted online with an agent and she found me a better deal than I could on the upgrade page (200/200 instead if 100/100 upgrade from 75/75 for $11 less than current plan)"
Fios,ffirt13,t1_ffir4v1,1579981107.0,"I had a bunch of discounts, some of which will no longer apply, but I am still going from 75/75 to 200/200 and renting the new router (I own my G1100) and saving $11/month.   The channel lineup is slightly different, but I am not losing anything I care about.

If you compare on the web it will look like the new plan costs more because they don't show almost $30 in fees and surcharges on the old plan that are on your bill, but the new plans have no fees or surcharges. Just the sales tax isn't shown, but when the order is finished they give an estimate (~$5 for me).

They need to replace my ONT for the higher speed, and I wanted the switchover to match my billing cycle so I don't need to worry about prorated bill, so I won't be switched until 2/20."

Turn PrivateDNS (pointed to adguard) off when connected to my work WiFi, or when certain apps are running that won't work when adblock running (Ticketmaster)

Now it appears that whichever app asks for the function last gets it, and the only way to go back to Keep is to remove the app.  My specific issue is AutoWear, which I have many uses for and don't want to delete, but activating it via ""note to self"" is not one of my use cases."

If you want this instead of a watchface I am not sure if it is the best option. 

With the Watchmaker app you can create a custom watchface, and it can display Tasker variables, so you should be able to create a face that is just the variable.  I haven't used Watchmaker in years because on my first smartwatch it used too much battery, but it might be better now.  That was several years ago."

You get a replacement battery along with the screen, and yes it will still retain the water resistance if done by authorized service.

WearOS,fcx93f9,t1_fcwp6eq,1578056022.0,"Not to go too far off topic, but I have workarounds until Google finally fixes this.

For Note to Self:  I used IFTTT to intercept the Note to Self phrase and send it to my gmail account.  Not Keep, but better than the stupid Assistant notes that there is no way to access without voice.  It only works if I follow the Note to Self with the note all in one sentence.  If I pause, it asks me what the note is, and saves it to the Assistant note page.

For shopping, I use OurGroceries.  It is a little more cumbersome, but I can say ""OK Google, Ask ourgroceries to add XXX to yyy list"" (if I leave off the list, it saves to my last used list).  Need to use the whole phrase for each item because OurGroceries exits the conversation after each one is added."
