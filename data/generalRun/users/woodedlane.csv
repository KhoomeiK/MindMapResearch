AskReddit,ffegk0d,t3_et69u4,1579847160.0,"Well, Bush was famous for saying ""nuculer"" instead of ""nuclear.""  That bugged the hell out of me.  And I think Trump says it the same way.  btw - I think that ""nuculer"" pronunciation comes from the movie ""The China Syndrome"" where Michael Douglas' character refers to ""nuclear"" as ""nuculer."""

I'd first check to see if you even made enough money that year to require filing taxes.  After that, if you do, prepare to give upwards to half your salary.  In other words, I'd be saving half my salary until you figure out what they (IRS) wants."
