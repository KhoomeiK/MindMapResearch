This is 6th grade:

Basically I told Kate I liked Ian who was her brother Vinny’s best friend. Kate told Vinny, who told Ian. Then Ian had Colleen come up to me to ask me to be his girlfriend. I said “sure” and continued what I was doing. Two days later, without any contact from Ian, Colleen comes back up to me and says that Ian does not want to date me anymore. I said “okay” and continued what I was doing. Jillian later told me that Ian did it as a joke.

It was all so dumb."
