Austin,fh8yeqj,t1_fh8g0gn,1581369927.0,"APA asks that visitors not place their fingers or bodies inside the kennels, as all of their dogs were at-risk dogs from AAC or other shelters in the area and it's more likely than not that a given dog is either 1. reactive, 2. a door darter, or both (as well as medical cases). As such, they don't want to risk a dog getting loose if someone opens the kennel without having been trained in how to do so safely. I highly recommend getting volunteer certified though - their dogs are great and really need some attention and love, plus the staff is crazy knowledgeable about dog training if you're interested in learning more.

AFAIK there are no kennels at APA's Town Lake location that still contain AAC dogs, all of the kennels are APA dogs. In fact, I think the old AAC kennels now tend to contain some of the higher collar-color (i.e. harder to manage) dogs."

feedthebeast,fh2pmiw,t1_fh282nb,1581259193.0,"Yes, IIRC, four coil mags generate around 400 rf/t each? Isentropic with three coils should generate around 840 rf/t each if cooled with crushed ice I think.

In general the specialized augments tend to be far more powerful than a standard aux coil."
feedthebeast,fh25b3a,t3_f12q8y,1581235884.0,"I love doing various forms of TE power in the E2 Regular - haven't tried E2:Lite, so some of these may not be doable, but most should be:

- Using an automated pump in the Nether (RFTools Builder, Industrial Foregoing's Ranged Pump, etc) to get lava and run a bank of Magmatic Dynamos. To up the complexity and power gen, add the Isentropic Reservoir augment and cool them with water, Crushed Ice from Forestry, or Gelid Cryotheum. Crushed Ice is really easy to make if E2:Lite contains Nuclearcraft, just use the Supercooler.
- Use the oil generated by Cofh world gen to power Compression Dynamos. For more power and complexity, convert the oil to refined fuel and add the Ignition Plugs augment to the Dynamos.
- Use Numismatic Dynamos with either: 1. Excess or useless ores (Platinum and Mana-Infused ores aren't used for anything in the pack IIRC) stamped into coins with the Compactor or 2. Lapis, Apatite, or Biomes O Plenty gems with Lapidary Calibration augments in the Dynamos. If you have some form of power set up already, either of these options is really easy to automate with a quarrying setup (I like the RFTools Builder personally).
- Fishing power! This one also requires Industrial Foregoing. Use an IF Resource Fisher to get enchanted books and armor/fishing rods. Strip the enchantments off the gear with an IF Enchantment Extractor and run all the books through an Enervation Dynamo with the Disjunctive Extraction augment. You can just toss the excess fish or use a Culinary Generator from Extra Utils 2 to keep the system self-powered. For ultimate utility, run the raw fish through IF's Resourceful Furnace to generate Essence, which can be converted to Liquid XP with the Fluid Dictionary converter and then used for any enchantments you want to apply instead of using for energy!"
