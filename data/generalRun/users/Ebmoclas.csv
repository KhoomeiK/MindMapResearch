AskReddit,feewx9e,t1_fdms77y,1579042993.0,I would love to know more! Is it because of what they are grown in? Or general hygiene of the average mushroom harvester? How big is a mushroom farm? Was it just one type of mushrooms? They must have been fairly big if they were supplying supermarkets I suppose. Did you harvest using a mushroom knife? Which country are you/were you in? Sorry for all the questions!

I used to spend hours of my life making Orange supremes for the daily fresh fruit salad. After a while the juices make your hands burn. Yeah, gloves were not an option. Chef wanted to know why you couldn't keep your hands clean by washing them. If you tried to explain the burning, he just laughed and told you to get quicker at your knife work... Good times."
AskReddit,feet6rx,t1_fdp6pgb,1579040683.0,"Not just to cook evenly, but it is also about knowing exactly how long that potato is going to cook. Which is really handy if you are on veg and your head chef is checking cooking times from different sections. When called on by the head chef, I know exactly to the minute (pretty much second) when the potato went in and because they are always cut to exactly the same size and weight, I know to the minuet when they will be ready to come out. Depending on the size of the restaurant, you might have to be cooking multiple orders at the same time in which case it is even more handy to know which pan is coming off the heat and when."

CatastrophicFailure,fdnsg2c,t1_fdnbtc9,1578591910.0,That's why some years the hay and straw bales look like a brain damaged child stacked them! I always wondered as kid where they were finding all these incompetent farmers who couldn't even stack hay in a tidy fashion.

Just personal preference I guess. If you're going to put your face out there on a location based dating/pick up app, it shouldn't come as that much of a surprise when people try to date you/pick you up."
creepyPMs,fdjw1yb,t1_fdjeyr3,1578489366.0,"That seems a little extreme. As yours would probably be the only circumstance where this was ok. If you had said ""yes"" and they followed it up with ""Can I buy you a drink?"". I don't see the problem with that?"

AskReddit,fden1jx,t1_fdee3sm,1578342470.0,"Indeed. I love me a good second hand shop! I have spent many a happy Saturday morning ferreting through the various ones in my nearest town. Sadly, because where I live has a massive problem with the houses being owned as holiday homes there has been a huge decrease in donations over the years. The people who own these homes will get in a firm to completely ""re-do"" the house every five to ten years and perfectly good, barely used furniture and home goods get literally chucked in a skip and taken away to be dumped. I once asked is I could take a gorgeous Belfast sink from the skip and the guy said he couldn't let me. It was in their contract that everything goes to be disposed of. I was pretty gobsmacked. They said it was to stop people descending on their home to get ""free stuff"" when they saw it was renovation time and that it devalues the product lines if ""anyone"" can have one in their kitchen. The guy was pretty bitter about the whole experience too, but he said it happens all the time in the holidays homes of the rich and famous. Such a shame."
AskReddit,fdebsmn,t1_fde94ni,1578335581.0,"I hear you. Got given a load of old cookware when my grandmother died. My aunt decided they were too ugly for her children to have in their kitchens, so I could have it. Little did she know, I actually like re-homing ugly cookware and nothing in my kitchen matches. 
Actually, that's not true anymore. I still have most of my things, but matching crockery and pans etc were purchased for the soon to be ex-wife. She can have them (if she wants them) and I will keep my ugly mishmash."
AskReddit,fde8i22,t1_fde0w3o,1578333500.0,They got rid of that policy because people would go to thrift shops and buy a load of old pyrex for next to nothing (because it has a tiny chip in it) and then send it into them asking for replacements. I don't blame them one bit for getting rid of that policy. I think it says a lot more about the mentality of the consumers than the companies. I agree that it really sucks though.
