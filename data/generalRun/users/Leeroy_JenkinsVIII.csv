depression,ffuetzq,t3_ev3f7j,1580240467.0,Stick it out my guy. How far are you into it?
ForeverAlone,ffsugs6,t3_euf1fn,1580192934.0,"It's funny; I've basically brute-forced my brain's programming into being able to give off those more welcoming subconscious vibes and cues that make people feel at ease whenever I interact with them.

But trying to maintain those vibes is so mentally draining that I can only keep up for a limited time before letting go. And, oh boy, once I do let go, things immediately become awkward. I can even sense the precise moment when whoever I'm speaking with suddenly becomes uncomfortable with my presence for reasons they probably can't explain. 

At this point I don't get mad anymore, though it still hurts when it happens."
ADHD,ffqcuib,t3_eud5t1,1580130645.0,"Even with Adderrall I struggle to organize myself and function properly.

All it does is keep me from mentally locking up and unable to even start anything for the day."

Godspeed my guy."
depression,ffaqjbh,t3_es440i,1579742141.0,"My dad keeps assuming that I don't want to be happy or some masochistic shit like that.

No matter how many times he tries to relate to me, I have to take his word with a grain of salt cuz it doesn't seem like he's been as deep as I have, especially when he says shit like that."

I'm trying to sort some shit out right now."
depression,ff74lvb,t3_eryupp,1579641015.0,"The funny thing is that it does get easier, but it still sucks that you have to spend so much time improving to realise that, and there's hardly anyone there to hug you if you mess up or congratulate you if you succeed.

No matter what people tell you, it always feels like you're on your own."

ForeverAlone,ff5g634,t3_ermd75,1579591433.0,"Was raised by a neurotic single mother who groomed me to be a little gentleman and worship women like goddesses while simultaneously stunting my development by being overbearing in the worst of ways. 

Only really started to break free from her programming towards the end of high school, but by then it was too late.

Been struggling to build myself from the ground up since."

ForeverAlone,ff37m67,t1_ff37ar7,1579535606.0,"Aye, we don't really talk anymore so it'd be pretty awkward if I brought it up out of the blue. 

Thank you anyway, though."
ForeverAlone,ff365ho,t1_ff34axj,1579534608.0,"I've slowly but surely been trying to get my act together, but it's been a rough process. I constantly struggle with ADHD and perhaps even depression (though the latter hasn't been officially diagnosed), but I've found a niche in writing and filmmaking and want to pursue both skills as professional careers. 

I learned that the only way to satiate the repugnant beast threatening to kill me from within is to get good at stuff and at least try to appreciate what I can experience in this life. 

I've been trying to exercise but can only last two weeks before giving up and having to start the regimen all over again. Luckily I'm pretty skinny and can manage my diet just fine. 

I've forced myself to read social settings and cues better and can now more easily talk to people despite my crippling anxiety. I even almost hooked up with a girl last semester but fucked it up when I couldn't initiate any physical stuff. I could even read the moment when she wanted me to do something, but I backed out because I feared intimacy as much as I craved it. 

Tldr; things are getting better, but I wish I've been able to make more progress than I already have in a shorter amount of time."
ForeverAlone,ff33g4g,t3_erbuam,1579532691.0,"Almost committed suicide over a year ago after I was told by a chick I thought I had a chance with to stop texting her because I was getting too clingy. 

The only reason I was like that was because I've only known rejection my whole life up to that point, and I didn't know how to handle the rush of endorphins I was getting from going on a first date for the first time in my life. 

Once I got blocked, any hope I had left was drained completely. All those years of rejection had taken its toll, and I snapped. I felt like my whole life amounted to being nothing more than a creepy burden to everyone I had ever known and cared for. 

Decided to jump into the icy cold harbor near my house and hopefully drown or die of hypothermia. 

I couldn't bring myself to do it, though. When I was standing at the edge of the pier, I felt like I was at the precipice of an abyss I had no way of coming back from. It was scary, there was no one there to stop me, and I felt too alone and vulnerable in this terrible place. 

I ended up chickening out and collapsed, sobbing as I profusely apologized to everyone and anyone I had ever creeped out, wronged, or disappointed. 

It was a shameful experience, to say the least."
ForeverAlone,ff31xg0,t1_ff2yaot,1579531530.0,"Fuck man, I'm sorry to hear that shit.

It's already painful to have never dated at the age of 20, let alone at 40. Just...fuck..."
depression,ff31bn7,t3_er67ws,1579531046.0,"Love is an addiction that you have to keep in moderation just like any other substance or behavior. 

The more you let it consume you, the more destructive the withdrawal is once you realize it's gone."
depression,fectno5,t3_eoeeby,1578984172.0,"Aye, I'd self-harm by repeatedly slamming my head against a wall really hard. Been doing it since I was 10. 

It's like I have this urge to punish myself for not living up to expectations. I need to be held accountable for my failures as well as let out all the bottled up rage boiling inside me. This is the only way I know how.

Sometimes I hope to god someone walks in on me violently smashing my own head in. Otherwise no one can tell what I'm putting myself through because there's no scars or anything to show for it.

But ye, that shit's still bad, man. Don't be afraid to talk to someone about it even if it doesn't look bad from an outsider's perspective."
ADHD,fdnxpd9,t3_em508m,1578594966.0,Last semester I found myself periodically pulling out strands of hair until I started to look like my hair was thinning/balding. Made me look sickly and fucked up and it's only now starting to revert back to normal.
depression,fdnpvai,t3_em40kf,1578590610.0,"Aye, sometimes shite like that can prove a bit dicey depending on the kind of guy friend you're working with. 

Like, if a guy is also feeling lonely and depressed due to an inability to attract women, he might mistake that kind of physical affection as sexual affection, especially if he's had no real contact prior. Something like that might send a signal you didn't intend to send, and now the friend might develop feelings for you that you won't be able to reciprocate. 

I should know, as I've mistaken platonic affection for sexual affection plenty of times in the past due to my own insecurities. It's led to many burnt bridges I wish I could rebuild. 

No one's really to blame in that situation, but just be ready to communicate your intentions properly if you sense that might be happening. Maybe provide a platonic shoulder to cry on if you know he's going through some shite, too."

depression,fd3fhc2,t3_ejy9gh,1578157788.0,"I think you should at least try and lighten the load, so to speak. It's good to honor the memory of loved ones, but not to the point to where it begins to weigh you down."
depression,fd3eckn,t3_ejykrh,1578157514.0,"I admit, the fact that I put the concept on a pedestal is the one of the few things keeping me going right now. 

I know it's foolish, and said reverence will only be able to take me so far before I can no longer continue, but there are things I want to at least try to accomplish in this life before I let the void take me."
depression,fd3dht7,t3_eju58r,1578157212.0,"It's selfish, but just because it's selfish doesn't mean it's morally abhorrent in any way. 

I think that's the problem when people say stuff like that. It's not so much the statement itself as it is the implication behind that statement. They think it supports an argument when, in fact, it's merely an observation."
Crushes,fd3ark3,t3_ejqnql,1578156443.0,"I was at a concert with my friend group during Senior year of high school. We were leaning against a wall at the back, and at some point during one of the slower songs, I felt my crush lean into me a little bit.

Fuck man, my heart felt like it was about to explode in that moment, and to this day I'm not even sure if she meant for that to be a signal or anything."
Crushes,fd39hvb,t1_fd12dk2,1578156015.0,My condolences
ADHD,fd38ogq,t3_ejj3jh,1578155758.0,"Yup, not all the time, but this hyper self-awareness happens often. I even seemed to have signs of this tendency to become hyper aware going as far back as elementary school, as I'd sometimes comment on stuff like the passage of time to my parents. 

It gets scary, man."
