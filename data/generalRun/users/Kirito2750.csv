They have older albums that are produced very differently than newer ones, and the newer ones sound so much better, and make me like the music. Also take day the production on “Herman’s hermits, their greatest hits” which is an album I loved as a young child (I was that guy in 2006) but now I listen to it with different perspective of having listened to tons of music, and now the songwriting is great, but the production just is not good to me.

I’ve never had to, in real life, do integrals by hand. Google is just like that calculator. My father is in his sixties, and he has no clue how to find anything on google.
