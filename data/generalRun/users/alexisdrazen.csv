sims2,ff8lr36,t3_es2xsw,1579684731.0,"You can buy the discs used from somewhere or torrent it illegally. EA was giving the Ultimate Collection to people who asked through Origin, but I don't think they do that anymore."
StrangerThings,femc7cy,t3_epuqcd,1579248170.0,"Why bring back characters that are canonically dead (that we saw die)? It's not that kind of a show. When a character dies, they're gone."
StrangerThings,feclcu5,t3_envfrw,1578976760.0,I'm glad they didn't make him diabolical. It's not realistic. He's not supposed to be a villain in the story. He's just a regular douche.
secondlife,febmebw,t3_eobt22,1578960371.0,They want to be unique and don't want someone to copy their style. I don't blame them.
fatlogic,febm859,t3_eo9m9n,1578960294.0,"out of curiosity I googled the author of this piece and she is extremely skinny and an ""avid runner,"" very odd"
secondlife,fdzy64s,t3_endu0d,1578798682.0,"If you want to have virtual sex in SL, you will need to buy body parts for your avatar and partner's avatar, and find some place with sex animation furniture- there are many Adult lands for this purpose, particularly nude sex beaches. You could also buy land and buy the appropriate furnishings yourself. There are freebies available, but pretty much everything in SL that is quality content needs to be bought with Linden dollars."
fatlogic,fdzpplt,t3_enfb82,1578792992.0,"Lady, these people just tried to accommodate you and be nice to you. You see “fatphobia” in their actions, because you actually hate yourself and you project those feelings of disgust onto everyone else. Your reaction to other people says it all. You assume they see you the same way you see yourself."
fatlogic,fddjwaj,t3_ekn7m2,1578315169.0,Hate this idea that women change their diet and engage in exercise only for “the male gaze” or to fit into “patriarchal beauty standards” when I couldn’t give less of a crap about random men and what they think about how I look. Muslim women who wear hijab work out and play sports. Lesbians work out and play sports. Are they doing it to be hot and sexy for men? Just because some women engage in activities FAs personally aren’t into doesn’t mean they’re doing it for men.
