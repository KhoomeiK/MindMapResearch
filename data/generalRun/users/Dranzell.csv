Vive,ffmfa9j,t3_eu7pg6,1580053788.0,"Yes, if you can't differentiate between VR and real life that badly then you have a problem and should seek professional help.

There we go, I said it."
MMORPG,ffmcb6w,t1_ffmbhzf,1580052315.0,"I know exactly how long it takes.

Don't compare it with an AAA game, and because it is in early access they don't need to beta test the updates too much."
MMORPG,fflo5ec,t1_ffk2fea,1580041980.0,"Never have breaks? Devs work 9-17 from Monday to Friday. Is it that bad to expect weekly updates for an unfinished game?

Also, when vacation/holidays happen, it's not the whole team who takes off at the same time.

You have some big issues comprehending such basic stuff."
MMORPG,fflncf3,t1_ffk31j4,1580041783.0,"People have been asking for MMO Pokémon for years, so I guess the idea was good."
pcmasterrace,ffirqee,t1_ffirjwa,1579981054.0,"I never said I don't like it, but it's hard to see actual components past the white lights.

Do you see anything except for the water cooler and ring lights from the fans?"
memes,ffinw13,t1_ffinlgt,1579978380.0,"There is no understanding in basic maths (think numbers, adding and subtracting). Everything was chosen arbitrarily, from the base 10 we use in the everyday life, to the order of the numbers. 

It all starts with multiplication that you can actually start explaining why."
memes,ffinht2,t1_ffin6sj,1579978114.0,"Actually I think I understood fairly well what he said.

It's just hard to ask a bunch if kids why is that, when it comes to fixed sciences like maths."
memes,ffin06a,t1_ffimwsm,1579977774.0,I don't think the right way to prove a point is on a graded test. I'd probably ask the teacher about it when the tests come back. So everyone can hear it.
memes,ffimvki,t1_ffi23aa,1579977686.0,"I don't know why people do it. I can't stand watching dubbed content. I watch movies/cartoons/anime in their original language (with subtitles if needed).

It feels that the voice actors who do the dub do not perform at the same level as the original actors."
memes,ffim47q,t1_ffikfpf,1579977159.0,"1+1=2. Why did this happen?

Yeah, sounds kind of dumb."
memes,ffilxzf,t1_ffi3r98,1579977041.0,"Can we take a moment to talk about task comprehension? It's not that the kid was wrong, the teacher obviously did not think when setting the task, but the kid also kind of failed understanding a basic task, differentiating between the notation of the exercise and the exercise itself.

I would probably give the points to the kid, but should also have a lesson about what was wrong in there and why."
dbfz,ffifoeb,t1_ffibwna,1579972753.0,Goku GT and Kid Buu are kind of unique when it comes to normals. Also Teen Gohan.
memes,ffiedgs,t1_ffi8oqn,1579971861.0,More like stupid. I've seen a lot of rich people say they don't like contraceptives because they go against their faith. Or because they can just pull out.
pcmasterrace,ffidj7u,t1_ffi1s9p,1579971302.0,"I mean, it's as hard to see actual components with all the white lighting."
pcmasterrace,ffidfks,t1_ffi4ybh,1579971233.0,"For all that matters, I enjoyed the joke.

However reddit jumps on the down vote bandwagon easily."
memes,ffhtpeb,t1_ffhtoe1,1579953397.0,"Teaching the young properly is above being a killjoy in my book, so it's totally finy."
memes,ffhtizj,t1_ffhojcr,1579953140.0,"No, it doesn't. That kid failed to understand the basic layout of an exercise. Honestly, you can't really accept this, even if it is technically true."
