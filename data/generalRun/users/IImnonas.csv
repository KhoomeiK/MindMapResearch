There are maybe 2 or 3 *good* seasons in total. That's less than half. You're looking at a show that misses more than it hits. Just because the protagonist (debatable at this point) is a passionate actor who's brought his all despite showrunner fuck-ups doesn't change the fact that the show is NOT on par with quality shows. Daredevil had more Arrow than Arrow did most the time. It's sad it's over, but not because it was groundbreaking.

But because of the wasted potential completely squandered by directors and writers unwilling to listen to their actors and fans."

We also know, and of course he could have just done this for her sake, that the Traveller appeared to Jester as a child. And has apparently grown up *with* her. Of course this could be for her benefit but I think it makes more sense if, whether through unique wish circumstances or not, he was simply believed into being by Jester.

 It's not unheard of in dnd lore (The Kuo-Toa do it all the damn time) and it would add a very powerful side to her faith. The fact that she might have literally *created a god* outside of the divine gate is amazing."

A Barry Allen that didn't even have the name flash, didn't know there was a reverse flash, didn't know about the speedforce, and isn't even super woven into the world he's on, will not be able to carry the weight of a flashpoint.

 Literally none of it will matter cause their universe is filled with characters no one cares about. There isn't a single shred of immersion into their characters and because of it no one's gonna be invested in the conflict. 

If it's flashpoint. It will bomb.


Edit: Jesus Christ you people are mad.

RWBY,fewp9xi,t1_fewoh7p,1579417440.0,"It's obviously all conjecture, but, would the drive to avenge a loved one be considered a *negative* emotion? 

I see it in a similar vein as the lawful good character that kills someone who stole, he does it out of rigid right vs wrong feelings and isn't inherently negative on his side of things. 

What if that's why/how it's such a rare and difficult activator of the ability? Cause pure feelings to avenge a loved one against an evil is such a rare and corruptible feeling, most people would fall into that hate and revenge making it impossible. 

But with how pure and nearly unwavering Ruby is maybe she will be able to bring forth the truest and most honorable form of vengeance uncorrupted by rage or hate? 

Obviously this is all in the full theory realm, but it seemed odd to me that if she was just breaking down and filling with dispare over her mother, why were her eyes flashing? It seemed almost out of place with the emotions she would be feeling IMO.

People expect a dog faunas to be loyal and it breaks the mold.

His semblance could stop the fight before it begins and allow rwby to flee. 

He could be more loyal to clover than ironwood, and clover seems very likely to join qrow on the heroes side of things.

Overall it's mostly based on his reactions and how he's been treated by his comrades. He's probably got some animosity against his teammates and it's the perfect set up for a ""You guys are blindly loyal to a broken man, I thought *I* was the dog faunas"" kinda situation where he proves he's not just a dumb loyal dog like his teammates think and he's the only one truly loyal to the people of Mantle."

My theory at this point is that silver eyes can be activated via rage/vengeance and that while it's more difficult to do, it is a more powerful effect/ability. Maybe something that could even hurt Salem."
