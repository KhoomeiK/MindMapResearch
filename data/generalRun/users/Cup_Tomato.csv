offmychest,fcshcjq,t3_eiocky,1577916567.0,That sounds terrible to have to deal with. I have a friend who was going through something similar having spent 7 years in a marriage where the last few she spent in perpetual misery due to her deadbeat husband. They finally divorced about a month and half ago and now that he's finally out of the picture for good she's been having some of the happiest times in her life. I just wanted to bring that up as some consolation that things can get better for you and I hope they do soon.
offmychest,fcsgd0i,t3_eiof2y,1577916130.0,I'm sorry about what you're going through. I don't want to be one of those old people who just says welcome to the rest of your life get used to it but yea things can change quite a bit the more you go into adulthood that can make you feel confused or alone. Having relationships with people as an adult can be a world of difference from your teens because you start having less time and energy to spend on just flagrantly hanging out with anyone anytime you please and the same goes for your peers. It was around 21 that I was feeling quite the same but little did I know I was experiencing the beginnings of major depression so I just wanna say if things keep getting harder for you please don't be afraid to reach out for professional help.

AskReddit,fcra47f,t3_eikp6o,1577898984.0,I have no idea. Love me? Because we share many interests?
