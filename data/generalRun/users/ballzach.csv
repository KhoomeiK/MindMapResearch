>Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that the pattern of hemodynamic effects seen here reflect improved physiological brain function.

There just isn't any direct evidence of this.  There is so much influencing hemodynamics and metabolism of any tissue that I am not convinced that it necessarily has a strong enough correlation to cognitive processing to draw that conclusion.  I realize that they are just suggesting and speculating, which is fine; I don't mean that in a derogatory way.  I'm just not really convinced.

edit: I want to add that I like this paper, and research like this is great."
