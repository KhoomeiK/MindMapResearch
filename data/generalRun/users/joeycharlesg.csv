BreakUps,ffiupay,t1_ffi83lh,1579983191.0,"I think she's messing with you. And probably not intentionally. I think most girls test us. If you say something along the lines of, ""contact me if you want to give it a go down the line."" And then don't contact. It will do wonders. I promise!"
BreakUps,ffi7uns,t3_ets4jh,1579967364.0,Go no contact. It is the only way. Trust me! Contacting her will only annoy her. She will wonder and start thinking about you if you don't.

I would take my time, teasing you a bit, kissing and licking up and down your legs. I would start caressing and kissing your ass cheeks and licking all around your pussy before I finally do a long flat tongue lick over your clit. But I would move down to your cute little asshole and lick you and tongue-fuck you. I'm up for almost anything after that"

There were times before that where I couldn't even drive because I was sobbing so hard and couldn't breathe. Now I'm ready to step down my dosage.

offmychest,fcnrlbc,t1_fcnql8p,1577817096.0,Man. That is so tough. Don't feel obligated for anything or like you owe him anything. 'Roids do so much more to a body than add muscle. It changes one's brain. I'm sure he was a decent guy. But he is more than just trending towards violence. That is what I think.

I would say he is representing a persona that isn't him. I only say this because you said it happened once and he felt bad. If it happens again in the near future, I would definitely call that a red flag and have that be at least the second strike against him."

You have value. Your writing is crisp and well-written. Your best revenge on society and to her is to show yourself strong and power through. Yes, work can definitely suck. You just need to find something you enjoy doing. Many, many years ago, my brother walked in on me while I had a knife to my wrist. I was in highschool. That was 30ish years ago. I have so many memories. Some horrific, some wonderful, but I will take them all. I have 2 lovely daughters that never would have existed. I know it all seems hopeless right now. You are allowed to your feelings of despair. Cry it out. We're all in this together. We're thinking of you and know you will power through this."

We'll set an appointment and go from there. She is an amazing and unique gal. There is no textbook on how to handle her. All I know is that I love her. And I always will. No matter what.
BreakUps,fcjhw45,t1_fcjf5xo,1577688216.0,I just wrote a reply that I meant to answer to your comment. I appreciate you and what you're saying. I can see your heart through your words and I wouldn't want a friend on my side to be any other way but honest and straight forward. Thank you.
BreakUps,fcjhp1k,t3_ehfvct,1577688000.0,"Dude, I hear absolutely everything you're saying. I truly appreciate your heart. You'd be shocked to hear how old I am. I watched my youngest son get worked over. And I had so many talks with him. He was wrecked from a toxic relationship. He gave it everything and she was so cruel to him. He sees it now. BTW, he's happily with a new gal that appreciates him. The point is I told him over and over to not text her and that she was absolutely toying with him. And he stopped when he was just exhausted from her and came out stronger on the other side and she was chasing him hard because he had ignored her. And he saw how toxic that crap is. I know. And I was doing great. But just to hear her once say, after all the belittling and reprimanding, that she loves me and misses me is more than enough. She's actually wonderful when we're getting along. Anyway, one more shot. I'm sure I'll be back here. Thanks again."

Part of me thinks she'll actually try and go to counseling together like she promises. The other part of me doesn't care. She is that amazing and I am that willing to go through the pain that inevitably comes at the end. It's pathetic. I know. I was doing good. Thank you for trying to save me."

BreakUps,fca5vw0,t3_egrl7a,1577563513.0,You sound like me. Except your future is before you. I watched my son go through his first love for a couple of years. He was absolutely smitten. The way she broke up with him and strung him along with little bread crumbs of hope was absolutely brutal. He was devastated and certain he would never pull out of his funk. He was depressed for months and I tried to help him. (I have trouble following my own advice now that I'm going through it myself) He did come out of it and now has a GF that adores him and he's happier than ever.

TooAfraidToAsk,fc9y289,t3_eguhe4,1577559916.0,I've never heard of Moe's. The barbacoa at Chipotle is the absolute best meat I've ever had from a large commercial Mexican food establishment.
AskRedditAfterDark,fc9xkap,t3_eguhhf,1577559697.0,"Wow! That's interesting. For the pure animalistic physical sex, nothing beats doggie style. I love having my girl arching her sweet ass up to meet my thrusts. And I love to wet my thumb to slip it in her sweet little asshole to grip and hold on to as I pull her to me. I also like to make her little ass cheeks glow red as I slap that naughty ass. I think most of the girls like that as well. I would probably have to go with that.  
   That's not to downplay the intimacy of missionary that has it's own merits. I love going slowly like that and looking into each other's eyes and deep French kissing while we're both intertwined and cumming. If that included oral, that would change everything. I would be fine with doing nothing more than going down on her and enjoying that. As long as I always had the option to service myself."

Baby?

Babee?"
UnsentLetters,fc7sroi,t3_egni9z,1577517699.0,That is the saddest thing I've ever read 😭 I wonder how common that is? That is the ultimate tragedy. Pride is the worst. I told her that would be our downfall. And right now neither of us is budging. And I miss her so fucking much
