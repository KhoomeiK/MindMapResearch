It’s heartbreaking seeing all the homeless, people with no mental and healthcare here while letting others in. It goes against everything in my body to say no to people wanting a better life but in reality we can’t save others before helping ourselves. Just my honest opinion"
SandersForPresident,ffi0rep,t1_ffgte87,1579961576.0,I have an I’m not trying to be argumentative at all and appreciate your help :) just some people are very stuck in the ways of government BAD. They think dismantling the entire system we have now will throw everything into chaos. I of course think they are wrong and think we can implement it safely and the benefits outweigh the risks. My friends of course have jobs that have medical health benefits where I (self employed do not) so it’s harder for them to see beyond themselves. Hopefully they can come to our side but I know they will begrudgingly vote for Trump.
SandersForPresident,ffgs7uq,t1_ffgiglw,1579913721.0,Very true just knowing from a few friends that are Libertarians they do not trust the government at all and think it will be a bigger mess if they get involved in our healthcare and other stuff. I don’t blame them since our government has consistently failed us and do think it will be very hard to win them over no matter how you scope things for them
