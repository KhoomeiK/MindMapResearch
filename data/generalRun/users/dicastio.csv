AnarchoMonarchism takes this idea to the next level and eventually it's natural conclusion. A national level Big Pal.

The monarch needs to be a hero, best at everything they do and the proof to back it up. Using the game, money and adoration the monarch then redistributes that wealth to make sure the communities basic needs are met.
I cannot stress how important the ""Hero"" part of the monarch is, without a large heroic epic to back up the Monarch, the basis of power crumbles as people cannot truly unite under a weak and ineffectual leader.

As such International solidarity for all workers of the world is a cornerstone of Socialist Ideaology, that things like nationality and race are just how the Capitalist class divides and conquers the world.

Also, pushing other countries to have the same labor practices as America would greatly benefit both nations. Capitalists couldn't run off to other poorer countries as much, thus leaving a nuclear option against labor that demands too much. The more that workers conditions are good across the world, the more power we have to bargain out a fair deal with the Capitalist class.
