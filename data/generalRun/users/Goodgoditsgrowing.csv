therewasanattempt,ff1m6ic,t1_fez918q,1579481473.0,"It’s still a problem, it’s just less glaring. Example: if your hair product company is full of people with a specific type of hair (for the sake of simplicity, let’s use white people with straightish hair) they aren’t going to think of the needs of people with different hair types (ex: black people  with textured/natural hair or chemically straightened hair, or really even the curly hair needs of white people, depending on the company’s internal diversity and the people those employees, specifically the higher ups, interact with), and they aren’t going to think to design and market those curly hair products - resulting in loss of income and, in my area where there is little diversity and very few people with curly, kinky hair or who are black, you end up with women not shopping at their local CVS because they don’t carry any of the hair products those women want. And while I’m not in that category (white but with curly hair, so I often select products “for curly, kinky, natural textured hair” - aka “black” products in most beauty/cosmetic product markets) I can imagine it would be frustrating to have to go to an entirely different shop to find products that work for you. Not to mention that segregating those products by store segregated those people by store, meaning fewer black/curly haired people interact with white/straight haired people on a casual run-into-each-other-at-cvs-and-become-at-least-visual-acquaintances way. 

Another example might be “flesh colored” products (skin make-up like concealer, bandaids, bras/underwear, ballet tights, etc) are only flesh colored if you’re white (obviously it’s still not a perfect match of skin tone, but it works). If a dark skinned black woman puts on a “skin toned” bra under her white shirt it’s gonna be more see through than if she hunted down a rarely found brown bra.  That said, women’s undergarments have come a long way in recent years and now many shops offer “light beige”, “tan”, “espresso”, etc. same improvement recently on skin make ups."

Mj can be habit forming, but not in a chemical dependency way. 

For instance, take a prescription pill that doesn’t require higher doses over time to remain effective or cause with drawbacks when stopped and can be stopped cold turkey - not addictive. Drugs can be addictive, as any chemical rush can be - take sugar or caffeine for example: you *will* go through withdrawals if you eat a ton for years and then stop cold turkey. I’m not a chemist and not versed in a wide variety on drugs, so I’m gonna stop there. 

But I will say that the way mj works, you have natural cannabinoid receptors in your body and we don’t understand it well. We know that mj works like water flowing over a wall - you need to get over a certain threshold to get high, and *generally* usually at a chemical level it takes *less* Quantity psychoactive thc to get youhigh if you already have some “water” piled up against that “wall” so you need less “water” added to flow over the top of the wall into being high.
