Ben Wallace would have pulled Draymond's ho card all damn day too, that's disrespectful to try and compare Draymond to him just bc he won some Defensive awards during an offensive era. Rudy Gobert wouldn't have even been able to play solid minutes if teams still had true big men like Shaq always preaches on"

This kid should be watching YouTube tutorials for OL play and look up all the info he can on OL drills. Along with lifting and eating obviously 

My high school used to make CIF D1 playoffs every season in the 2000s and we were a power running team with a bunch of 5'8, chubby 200 lbs OL and the occasional 6'0, 250 lbs OT at the biggest.

Teams were scared of us tho bc those guys were fuckin nasty maulers who outhustled and outsmarted defenses with solid, consistent technique.

DL is even easier to learn and get into"

And before people get mad, we have a tiny, micro sample of Abram's NFL coverage skills at Safety so lets not assume we'd be moving an All Pro away.

I think he's perfect for it, teams wouldn't just run crosses or slants on us all day as much and it would allow him to play in the box on run downs much more"

So we COULD possibly have another game in the Coliseum, since the team did include a final, 1 year lease option for 2020. I highly doubt it, but it would be funny AF to have 3 consecutive farewell games/seasons. Would be so fitting for our franchise more than any other"
Blackfellas,fehbi9f,t1_feh9lag,1579113146.0,"I'm trying to say that coaches of color almost ONLY get those chances to move up the coaching ranks if they are former players. White counterparts are mostly NOT former NFL players, but they are usually deemed with tags like ""a young football mind"" or labeled as part of so and so's ""coaching tree"" so they get many more opportunities despite having a weaker football resume. 

Black coaches are not seen as ""brilliant football minds"" for the most part, like you're saying about not being seen as leaders. I do think that this will change in the next 20 years or so, but it's still building up.

I think it's beautiful though that we've taken over the QB position for the future though. Russ, Lamar, Deshaun, Mahomes have all been prominent figures during this year's playoffs. Our youth playing football and are seeing that and are inspired."

I say well then you must think that Vallejo isn't the Bay then right? And he said I'm dumb, and he knows since he's lived in the Bay forever.

Next day while working my delivery route on the Peninsula I ask everyone if San Jose is in the Bay Area, and they all gave me a ""WTF?...yeahhhh"" look lol

aside from Mike Tomlin, basically all of our coaches in the NFL have been ex NFL players. Only way we seem to get into the door.
