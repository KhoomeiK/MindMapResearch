Someone else said that it's okay to try them all and I second that. I'm currently in social work and trying to move towards art/music too :) also feeling about as lost lol but at least you're doing it. I'm still stalling. You've got jupiter right on your venus. That says talent to me. :) NNode Leo. I think you're just doubting yourself!"

Since your sun is first of all your chart ruler and second of all at an anaretic degree (29°-0°) I feel it is extremely important. Sun in 5th, your EGO DEVELOPMENT is of utmost importance. Ruled by saturn, it is a lesson for this lifetime. In a past life (12house) cancer, I imagine you were extremely giving and self sacrificing. Trying to heal family. Jupiter and chiron do relate to healing an expansion, and with it ruled by cancer it would be spiritual healing, working with nurturing children/family, or through close relationships. You likely ""lost yourself"". This is not the goal anymore, even though there are still pieces of this evident in your psyche. Libra moon desires relationships and reflects on others' emotions to know their own. Heir environment is important. This is also conjunct your IC, showing more of your past (and past life). Caught up in other people. You could have had a loving but somewhat smothering mother who needed you to be conscious of her emotional and mental state, who needed you to care for others and not just worry about your own self as a kid. Grew up too fast maybe. Our past life can show up in our childhood as well-parent & child is generally karmic but it's not always black and white so idk maybe she wasnt that way. Like she was still loving but busy and concerned with other people, maybe caught up in her own bad relationships. You have to learn about relationships here. Healthy relationships with freedom and open ways of communicating and expressing love is important. You may be tempted to be with people who repeat past karmic patterns and kind of smother you and act territorial in a way or try to mother you. Your idea of freedom is different from other peoples so finding someone who understands it is going to be crucial imo.
Anyway so yeah self identity, discovery and creativity is the name of the game here. Being big headed sometimes could just be part of the karma honestly lol. Leo asc can become v disconnected from others tho and not see their actions affecting people so much, but hopefully with your mars sextiling your venus you can feel that more. Caution that you don't use people like u may have used in the past, continue treating people w the respect u want to be given. Freedom in relationships and support for your bigger visions and dreams. I think you must have some sort of creative aspiration, it wouldn't have to be art or poetry or whatever, creativity can happen in all sorts of ways. It doesnt have to make you money but I wouldn't be surprised if you made money from it. The real world is kind of new to you because of being caught up in other peoples emotional worlds in the past, or struggling with your own emotional self. What you can build, fix, create and do here to represent yourself really means something and is impactful to others. Your emotional self will die and be reborn repeatedly, growing stronger each time."
AskAstrologers,ffrulwx,t3_euhat3,1580166183.0,"Mercury is naturally associated with nervousness and so is uranus and pluto. Harsh aspects create tension which can cause more anxiety. 

•Moon in 3rd house (3rd house being gemini)
•moon receiving many harsh aspects making emotional part of life full of tension and difficulty. No aspects = doom but of course harsh aspects will feel harsher than a soft aspect like a trine. Your moon might feel like it is doomed though, causing fantasy of loss, death
•Moon inconjunct mercury (moon-mercury contacts known for anxiety. unhealthy ways of expressing nervousness, irrational thinking and getting caught up and absorbed-->also seen with your moon squaring Pluto)
•your chart ruler is in the 6th house (virgo) in the sign gemini. Your chart ruler Jupiter squares your sun and moon. Opposite pluto in 12th and pluto oppositions are intense. 
Pluto is destructive, difficult, powerful. You're afraid of yourself sometimes or your thoughts maybe, of being alone or maybe of death.
•sun in Virgo
•pluto in 12th can cause paranoia and self destruction. Also squaring your sun and moon. 
•Mars opposite uranus=tension with a 'nervous' planet and an energizing planet in tension

There might be more but this is making my head hurt lol. You've got a hell of a lot of mercury and since your chart ruler is Jupiter, that could balance you out. Study Jupiter in your chart, learning trust may be difficult for you but would help anxiety if there was faith that things would turn out alright. 
Obviously anxiety is a complex psychological disorder but I hope the fact that there is some of this evident in your chart feels validating. As a fellow anxiety sufferer I wish you lots of healing."

AskAstrologers,ffpjz8k,t3_euhexo,1580096870.0,I actually have a theory of your reincarnation story in your chart lol Idk if it would answer your question in any say though. Are you asking about the spiritual properties of the winter solstice and how that would relate to someone being born on that day? Or more about 0° sun sign?
AskAstrologers,ffpi9oq,t3_euhj9m,1580095695.0,"Well her venus is in 8th. 8th can be submissive in it's own way, submissive to the act and to being consumed by someone else. You didn't expect it because it stays hidden away, reserved for the other person that she chose. Submission has an element of dominance. It's consent to something and surrender to someone else's pleasure which can be very pleasing and feel like you're dominating by just allowing...idk had to explain. 
Also looks up Mars conjunct lilith lol. She has that, and again it's in the 8th. Look up lilith in the 8th too. 

Libra sun aims to please and enjoy submitting to something exciting and letting another take control. Sometimes they initiate (as a cardinal sign) the dominance, like they subtly suggest another to dominate them. 
Virgo mercury-mind of submissive (stereotype virgin). Opposing moon in pisces - pisces go with the flow and surrender to the situation and the moon comes out in sexual relations. The virgo desire for some control or having things ""just right"" kind of ceases and it's left up to her partner. Mercury 9th house guides and moon 3rd house is instead very ""allowing"" and permissive, open and again mutable so more going with the flow..."
