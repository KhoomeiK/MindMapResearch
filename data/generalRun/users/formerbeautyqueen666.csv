AskReddit,fdzl5a2,t1_fdzj1r2,1578791218.0,"I can't think of a specific moment that changed things. I guess I just looked back on all the negative reactions I got from that attitude. I realized I wasn't 'different' or 'edgy' or whatever. I was just an asshole. Like I said before, I still give my honest opinion when asked but I try to do it in a more constructive way. I find that if I'm assaulting people with my honesty, it's not coming from a genuine place. I wouldn't want someone to talk to me that way."

AskReddit,fdu4e61,t1_fdt3xri,1578727335.0,"Hey, former 'brutally honest' chick here. Once I realized that everyone, every single person on Earth, has insecurities I absolutely let up. I say realized because I was always told everyone had their own issues but I guess I never really believed it. If that makes sense. I don't know when it happened but I came to a point where I just started listening to people and instead of hitting them with some aggressive nonsense, I would just be there for them and give an opinion when asked. It's still my honest opinion but the delivery is softer. So, as you quoted, more honest and less brutal. I have more close friends now."
