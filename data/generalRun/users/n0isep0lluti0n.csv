Mention how painful that would be. To be standing up there. In a dress that isn't white. Watching your sister begin her future!

OP my heart goes out to you. I totally understand how much of a mess you must be over this and this request really is mental. Please, for your own mental health, cancel. Otherwise you might resent your sister forever for stealing this from you. 

Take your time to grieve and mourn. I understand that it's not just about the man you lost but all things with it. All things yet to be. Wish I could provide cheesecake and a hug."
relationship_advice,ff5qk0g,t1_ff5pp77,1579606207.0,"I wanted to add that, OP, where do you see this going? Is your goal to get married some day and do x, y, and z? Maybe travel? Whatever suites you.

But this isn't the guy that will be by your side doing that. If your goal is a LTR or something similar to marriage/partnership, think about the end goal when you start dating someone, after this guy, because if he doesn't check all your boxes...

If you plan to travel with him, would you do so around days you are menstruating? Or would be just abandon you in some foreign land? That sounds insane.

If ending this relationship will break your heart, you still need to do it if it's right. Not that it's much consolation, but you'll probably have a couple heartbreaks in the future that might be worse than this. It's kinda just how it goes. 

They say don't sweat the small stuff. And a guy that can't cope with your body doing its thang and shedding its uterine lining monthly, ya that's a big thing."

The friend probably didn't know the history between you all, and was reaching out with the mentality of ""family is family"". Most people, when hearing the alternative is foster care, will figure out a way to handle things because they're guilted into it. 

You, however, made a choice that is true to yourself and no one can blame you for that. You have taken many steps to avoid parenthood and it's silly to think that you would decide to play a parent when thrust into a situation. Also, your situation is scholastically straining--physically, mentally, and financially. Opting to not take on a child right now, even if you did want kids some day, is understandable. 

Do your friends expect you to thwart your career in order to provide for him? Or, if you were to continue your studies, how do they expect you to provide child care? With a schedule as busy as yours, it would be hard to be present. Hell, I'll bet it's hard enough to take care of your own basic needs and mental health/social life desires. 

In the end, fortunately, it worked out well that he was placed with a good family. But, even if he wasn't, as sad as it all is, none of this is your problem. You didn't ruin your marriage with someone five years older than your daughter, only to impregnate them later. HIS parents should have set something up for him. Life insurance policies? College fund? They're the TAs for not acting like good parents. 

It's a difficult situation, OP. But you're not the asshole."
