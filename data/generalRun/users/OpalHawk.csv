MakeMeSuffer,ffjs90l,t1_ffjkkt3,1580005554.0,"I’m trying to explain that the example you used was poor because Lots daughters having sex with him wasn’t told as a positive example in the Bible. Personally I don’t give a shit if there’s contradictions in the Bible because I’m an atheist and I don’t believe any of it to begin with. But if you’re going to quote the Bible for your argument, at least pick a passage that accurately fits your argument. And just because the the quote you initially gave included incest it doesn’t mean it condoned it. You’re example about Abraham would have been better (though that does predate the rules on incest technically), or simply the fact that Adam and Eve’s children would have committed incest, or Noah’s family would have had first cousins marrying. But the story of lots children isn’t condoned by the Bible, just told."
