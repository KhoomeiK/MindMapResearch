You just GAVE BIRTH. I can only *hope* there’s still some of the epidural in your system to help with the amount of pain you experience 4-5 hours ago!

That’s their job and reputation in the local cities if not everyone working at the time also thinks it’s hilarious and stays quiet. 

I will say though, there are more chefs than you think that don’t keep up on washing hands/gloves/not eating their personal food then touching your burger without washing. I see the last one nearly every single day, and I have my entire serving career. 

One of our head chefs at my last job was known for absolutely blowing it up in the restroom, we all thought a sewage pipe was fucked for weeks until we realized the smell always happened around his 5pm and 9pm bathroom visits. One day a food runner was waiting for the only stall in the men’s room to clear out. Out comes our chef, says hi to him, and walks out only to return to the line. Not only did the food runner end up taking his shit in the woman’s room because of the smell, with us lady servers guarding the door lol, he informed the GM and DoP of what happened. I happened to be the one who knocked on the office door, money in hand, and walked in during the chef getting yelled at by all sides by multiple managers/head head chef. He was put on prep for a week, which imo is not what I would have done for the guy that doesn’t wash his hands but hey, I’m FOH, not BOH, and probably written up but that was it. I shudder when I think about all the meals he made and brought to me, that I ate without question.

She had an infection that started in her gums, multiple teeth had clearly been removed in her past, and now we had to remove five more. She has a couple teeth left.  And a snaggletooth. It’s super cute. The infection had seemed to spread to her ears and eyes, in a way that impacted her hearing and sight. Her sight was also ruined by previous injuries. Whatever happened to her ears seems to correlate to her eyes. Her left eye (with the bigger ear) can close all the way, produce tears, etc. Her right eye can’t close. Her inner eyelid is detached and that’s what blinks/“closes”. She sleeps with one eye open. The boyfriend calls her Forrest Whitaker. She also has some skin issues we have been dealing with, alongside being on permanent eye drops. She also has been dealing with some major health problems, but she keeps proving to us she’s a fighter.

Police report and no contact until she can handle herself like an adult again. If you can move, gtfo and don’t tell her a thing until she cleans her act up. She just moved, can she really pack up and dip out again only a year later to follow y’all?

Reading your old post now...

Get. Out. Change branches with dh and get out. She came back 5 times in 2 days after she kicked out for mutilating your toddler? She put your tiny little girl through the worst pain she has ever experienced in her short life, TWICE, even signed the paperwork as her f* parent, and had the audacity to beat down your door for two days? I can’t imagine what she’ll do once it becomes clear you’re done with her. Get some distance between you before that happens."
