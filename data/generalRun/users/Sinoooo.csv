thedivision,ffvfvto,t3_ev64of,1580263162.0,Spent the last two days in the DZ hoping for a Ferocious Calm for an AR Clutch build and at about the 20th time getting roadkilled I realized it's just not worth the time and aggravation.  Maybe RPG 2.0 will be different.
E90,ffgzfg6,t1_ffgyf62,1579919024.0,"Unless you have proof it's been absolutely meticulously cared for, at that mileage, neglected maintenance like brake/transmission/differential fluid and oil/coolant changes can have already done some damage to those systems.  Whatever discount you might get on such a high mileage example likely isn't enough to be worth taking on that extra baggage.

Addendum: past 100k, I'd be concerned if there's no mention of the electric water pump, oil filter housing gasket, accessory belt/tensioner/idler being done.  That's not to say such a car would need them immediately, but I would plan on having to do them pretty soon."

Never again would he maintain eye contact if I properly stared at him.  He was so sweet, perfect companion for years afterwards.  Used to sleep over and being incapable of sleeping in, I would take him for walks in the early morning.  Sometimes I'd sit with him, listening to the trees, thinking about whatever my angsty teenage self thought about.  Rudy would notice, and do that incurably adorable thing goldens do where they stick their snout under your arm and lift."

I still don't care much for the lack of progression but I can understand why people enjoy it, having to fight the environment and not having combat be a foregone conclusion are refreshing changes of pace.  Honestly, not even just in that game mode, but across the board, the addition of Hunters made things much more interesting and I'm shocked they're just barely more than a cameo in Division 2."

I had already learned doing Survivor on PS3 to save every single blade for shiv doors, save ammo for the spots I always have trouble with, like the sewer fight with all the stalkers, and the rest is just stealth.  OP talks about this being one of the hardest things they've ever done in a video game, but in my book that crown still belongs to the Berlin level in Call of Duty: World at War on max difficulty."

BmwTech,fcv2d5b,t1_fcut8u2,1577993209.0,"Not very sure, but if the the different issues are connected I would guess the thermostat might be stuck, probably open if the coolant refuses to heat up.  Though I thought that would require a rich mix, not a lean.

Addendum: looking up the code it's either the coolant is actually not heating up, which suggests the Tstat is stuck open, or the coolant temperature sensor has given up the ghost.  I'd start by figuring that part out, clear all the codes, and then see if the lean condition keeps occuring."
BmwTech,fcuiotr,t1_fcuhhpl,1577981880.0,"I have no knowledge on the E60, but on the E90 there's a sequence of inputs you can put in the cluster to access a hidden menu.

Shutter speed will determine how blurry it is due to motion.  Together with the ISO, they all relate to the amount of light you're taking in.  When you're focusing on one of the three, you can use the others to compensate and maintain your photo within the ideal range of light so you don't under or overexpose.
