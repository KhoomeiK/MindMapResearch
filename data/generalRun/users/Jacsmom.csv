GoRVing,ffcwk5q,t1_ffcniq7,1579808763.0,Last couple times we were here there were ants. Not 1 so far this time.
GoRVing,ffcj198,t3_esuqem,1579800507.0,"It’s our 4th time camping here,  it’s close to where we live and we love it so much! This place was an old mobile home park and on a slope down to PCH. The spots are on tiered rows and all have a fabulous ocean view. The rows closest to the ocean have no electricity and water, the ones higher up do.  No sewer, but there is a dump station. Bathrooms are clean and the showers take credit cards for tokens. The spots are huge with vegetation between you and your neighbor. The smell of the coastal sage in the morning is heavenly!

For activities other than the beautiful beach, there is great snorkeling in the summer and fall, hiking within the huge park and lots of scheduled activities and hikes,  including sea glass jewelry making on Wednesdays. If you don’t want to “rough” it for dinner, Laguna Beach is immediately south and Corona Del Mar/Newport Beach to the north. Within the state park is the Beachcomber Cafe, which is a super fun place to eat and walk around."
