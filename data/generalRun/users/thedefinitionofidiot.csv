dndmemes,ffoznqx,t1_ffn2tdi,1580083678.0,"I once had an assassin working for a foreign government not only refuse to answer, but grabbed the rogue's dagger that the rogue was waving menacingly and stab it into his own hand without flinching to prove how committed he was to not answering. 

But I guess you could just cast Command and answer."

todayilearned,ffg4c9l,t1_fffb2x9,1579898181.0,"I mean, the idea that doctors not cleaning their instruments or frocks between treatments was responsible for disease was prevalent until the nineteenth century. Thomas Mütter was ridiculed by his colleagues for his fastidiousness."
dontyouknowwhoiam,fffrlgb,t1_fdn856e,1579890276.0,"Maybe not to you, but comedy *is* subjective after all. 

But, to explain why *I* like the McElroys and why, I think, they remain successful and grow ever moreso:

- They are all talented improvisers who can turn something you might chuckle at for a second, like a dumb Yahoo Answers question, into a longer bit. 

- Their brand of comedy doesn't punch down. They don't alienate groups of people by making jokes at the expense of groups. They are also candid about the issues they face, especially with mental illness.

- They work HARD at what they do. Justin and Griffin were, until fairly recently, video producers for (and co-founders of)  Polygon, producing many hit series for the site like Monster Factory, Car Boys, and more, on top of doing My Brother, My Brother and Me. Griffin started as a weekend editor for Joystiq in 2007 when he was only 20, and was MTV's West Virginia journalist for the 2008 Presidential election."

dndmemes,fdg6fax,t3_el5dmn,1578381911.0,"I don't think it would be uninteresting at all. Sure, you're a human, so you lose the racial features of the warforged, but you don't suddenly have all of the life experiences of a human of equivalent age. A warforged-turned-human wouldn't know the taste of fresh bread, the pain of hunger, the bone-deep exhaustion of a long day of marching along the road. The warforged are a race of potentially-immortal beings created for a now-obsolete purpose, struggling to find meaning when the very war they were forged to fight suddenly ends. Does your warforged suddenly find they are struck with ennui when they realize that being a human doesn't give them innate purpose? Do they become a hedonist, exploring all the pleasures denied to them by their previous form?

comics,fcmdggn,t1_fcl0iqs,1577771349.0,"There could be a year 0. The semantics of how we refer to an arbitrary amount of revolutions around the sun is pointless, *but* we almost globally use the Gregorian calendar, which divides the calendar into two. If you put a year 0 in the calendar, would it go into BC, or AD? No matter where you put it, adding a year 0 would throw off the count and we'd have to go through 2019 all over again, and it would raise odd questions about why there's a 0 AD but not 0 BC.

Do you put it in its own realm, separate from AD and BC for arbitrary reasons? That doesn't help with the counting thing—we'll still have to repeat 2019—and now you've further increased the arbitrary complexity of our calendar."

Of course, the real metric is to take your reasons and plot them with respect to time. You've got to have that graph take a downward trend over time or else your surely headed downstairs. Look at Augustine, he wrote a book detailing how much he sinned in his youth and still they made him a saint, and even a Doctor of the Church, so you know that boy's chilling upstairs."
