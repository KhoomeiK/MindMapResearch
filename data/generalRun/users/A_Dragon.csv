4chan,femf7vw,t1_fem7u3z,1579252371.0,"Did you skim that off a Wikipedia article or something cause you clearly don’t know wtf you’re taking about. 

First of all no one is talking about mutations. Mutations are random changes that occur (usually due to the environment). I’m talking about how heritability works. 

Secondly, I never claimed that anyone gets “double the mutations”...that would indeed be “retarded”. 

What I did claim (correctly) is that if a gene is possessed by both parents (even if it’s recessive) then the child will inherit that gene (and the condition that accompanies it). 

Dogs that are purebred are more likely to carry the same gene for whatever genetic conditions that breed is vulnerable to thus making it more likely that their offspring will inherit the condition. However a dog of another breed is more likely to have dominance in another area so the chances of their offspring developing the condition decreases unless the condition is dominant (but that’s rarely the case). 

God, just do the tiniest amount of research and you’ll see I’m correct.

4chan,feltodi,t1_felsoq2,1579230669.0,"That’s completely incorrect.

4chan,fels3c7,t3_epr706,1579229554.0,"I like how people think they are insulting Americans by using amerimutt but fail to realize that it’s actually a compliment. 

Purebred animals are very often genetically inferior (primarily because of inbreeding) and less intelligent than mixed breeds. Sure, 1-100 purebred animals is an exemplar of the breed (although in the case of many breeds, such as the bulldog, even the exemplars are cesspools of genetic inferiorities) but the average is much lower than it is with “mutts”. 

So by calling Americans “amerimutts” you’re calling them genetically superior and more intelligent than the average breed. 

Thanks for the compliment kind stranger!

Edit: for those arguing with the assertion that mutts aren’t genetically superior to purebreds...maybe do a simple google search before making your retarded counterarguments and you’ll see I’m correct. Save your dignity.
