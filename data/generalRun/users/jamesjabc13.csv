ChoosingBeggars,fgryt4h,t3_f00243,1581063079.0,I reckon this is just a troll.
GayPornActors,fgrydzg,t3_f012h6,1581062554.0,This is definitely Sean Cody. Top is Alexander but unsure about the bottom.
askgaybros,fgrxw6n,t1_fgrt6sp,1581061944.0,You would hook up with guys and then contact their family members telling them about it and saying you’re underage? And you did it because it made you feel powerful? Dude you sound like a sociopath.
askgaybros,fgqrb0t,t3_eztr72,1581029817.0,"I wouldn’t bring it up. However, I would not-so-subtly make it clear that you support him. Tell a story at the dinner table about how your colleague’s kid came out and everyone celebrated and you think it’s great or something like that."
survivor,fgqgbtp,t1_fgqfnkm,1581023641.0,"I bet my life that within 5 minutes of the first immunity challenge there will be one of two posts:

“DENISE MISSES A TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR THE FIRST TIME!” Or “I GUESS DENISE IS AT IT AGAIN, ALL TRIBAL COUNCILS”"
ChoosingBeggars,fgqepyf,t3_ezugl8,1581022752.0,Your mother is absolute fucking trash
survivorau,fgpvajl,t1_fgpjh6h,1581012694.0,The point of their alliance is that Mat won’t be backed into a corner. David will make sure he doesn’t get targeted.
survivor,fgp9su2,t1_fgp83gp,1581000286.0,Yeah that’s what I meant. Was thinking Peggy Olson when I wrote that
survivor,fgp2r3t,t3_ezm2g2,1580995253.0,I guess that makes Tarzan the first one to be guaranteed not to lower his placement.
survivor,fgp28ta,t1_fgojrc8,1580994829.0,"I feel like I remember Alexis saying that Cirie ran the post-merge and that even though she was closer to Parvati she would have voted for Cirie in a F3.

Also it was an 8 person jury so it might have been 4-4."
survivor,fgp1wgh,t3_ezn5ou,1580994530.0,Daisy herself literally already posted this
survivor,fgp1sbu,t3_ezphb8,1580994430.0,She looks like Elisabeth Olson
survivor,fgp1a78,t3_ezqikt,1580993992.0,They literally haven’t even interacted on screen and are on different tribes. In what way are they a trio?
survivor,fgozlrs,t3_ezrgm5,1580992955.0,"Doesn’t that make it an idol itself though? But with extra power?

I know it has been suggested that a nullifier needs to be played early. Like when voting you have to play your nullifier, and then when one is used everyone gets told that a nullifier was secretly played already that cancels it out."
survivor,fgonokq,t3_eznlua,1580977558.0,"I will jsut never forget when his power shifted to AK in season 2 and he literally said “how could anyone possibly want to follow him more than me. People have just loved me my whole life” or words to that effect.

Like he’s so fragile and self absorbed he can’t even grasp the concept of him not being beloved by all."
askgaybros,fgomewo,t1_fgnyn3j,1580975866.0,"I relate to this, but I feel like I’ve had much worse than that. I have one face pic on my profile most of the time, and I get guys having full on conversations with me and then asking for more pics. 

It’s very rare that I will get blocked, but a lot of guys will just stop responding and not send their pics. I feel like the general rule is:
1. If you are a blank profile;
2. You initiate the conversation; and 
3. You ask for pics

Then if someone sends their pics and asks for yours, you are obliged to send some back (even if you’re not interested) or you’re just a stupid cunt."
tennis,fgolv5g,t3_ezeykx,1580975159.0,I assume ‘Rindfleisch’ is German for ‘rump meat’ or similar. Having it as the word ‘flesh’ just feels so unwholesome haha
survivor,fgn8v1i,t1_fglzjgf,1580939883.0,"It has good payoff for the following reasons:
-Daisy said in confessionals that she didn’t want to work with David, so there’s one person gone he can’t rely on.
-He has built trust with Mat, basically ensuring he won’t be targeted until the swap.
-He flushed Brooke’s idol."
survivor,fgn84d6,t1_fgmotoz,1580939484.0,How did it benefit Brooke?
survivor,fgn76ec,t1_fgltbu8,1580938986.0,"To be fair, she made the right play changing her idol (even if her reasoning was bad). If she didn’t change it, Benji was going to play his resulting in a zero vote. Then Benji’s alliance was going to vote out Sharn on the revote. Benji has explained this on social media."
survivor,fgn44ww,t1_fgmxttq,1580937350.0,Lol what? Desi had a temper. I would say Jessica

survivor,fgn0cna,t1_fgmtzjk,1580935293.0,Lol me too. I’m watching from overseas and the site I saw it on had the final words as the thumbnail for the ep
survivor,fgn02pt,t1_fgmmgqd,1580935156.0,Yes I thought that was great. I sometimes found Mat to be a bit too ‘honest’ in his season. Like he was head of an alliance but he didn’t ‘play the part’ as such. His speech about how he picked Jacqui was amazing.
askgaybros,fglcgrc,t3_eytkkk,1580890734.0,"The difference is that he knows and trusts his girlfriend so obviously feels comfortable letting her hang there and whatever. Feel free to have hookups over, but if you don’t really know them then don’t let them have free reign of the house like he might do with his girlfriend"
survivor,fgkygvu,t1_fgk8j45,1580876713.0,"If you look at the first two episodes together, Phoebe had 8 confessionals which puts her near the top. While I agree that not having a confessional in episode 1 isn’t a good sign, you never really know what the editors are doing in Aus so I’m excited to see what happens."
