scifiwriting,ff9rlsv,t1_ff9qttq,1579719598.0,"Thanks :)

I am. The problem I'm having is I've been ""working"" on this for nearly two decades now, and have only the past year finally decided ""good or bad I need to just make this"" - but it's gone through several ""versions"" over the years. I can PM you some of the art/pages if you'd like (I don't want to post it publicly yet)."
scifiwriting,ff9qksa,t3_es6lz2,1579718797.0,"Setting-

Early 2100's: three major conglomerates (Balthazar, Caspar, Melchior) have spent the past two centuries consolidating power, undermining governments across the globe, and corporate-owned cities - with privately owned security forces - are now the norm. Individual rights and liberties are forfeited with employment agreements required to work for any of the ""Big 3"" companies or their subsidiaries, and finding employment outside those entities is nearly impossible.

Story-

A vandal is shot nearly to death while evading ""Constables"", and as is standard practice due to his inability to afford healthcare - he is sold to a subsidiary of Caspar. On an orbital R&D station above Earth he is used to test an experimental ""synthetic"" body consisting almost entirely of nanomachines. The highly painful process (sabotaged by someone involved in project) sends the test subject into a rage, culminating in numerous deaths and his escaping the station - free-falling to Earth.

One of the people killed in the test subject's escape was a lead engineer on the project. This engineer has created a ""consciousness backup system"", meant to activate upon his death. Upon activation, this ""digital clone"" commandeers a similar nanomachine body and sets off to locate and exact revenge on the ""man"" who killed him. 

While all this is happening there are various subplots and ""intrigue"" happening, and eventually the first two ""digital humans"" ascend to god-like omniscience but also paralyzing apathy/cruelty. 

If this sounds a bit long winded, it's because its meant to be several years worth of story arcs for my web comic. Also because its long winded."

People don't like it because of various reasons, but the bottom line is it's a decent pistol with more features than your average glock (a crowd favorite), and at a reasonable price. Additionally, it's specifically a great ""first"" pistol because of various safety features including the chambered indicator and the grip/trigger safeties. 

As I understand it some of the more common ""complaints"" are that it's actually an HS2000 rebranded by a company that basically bought the rights to the Springfield stamp."
