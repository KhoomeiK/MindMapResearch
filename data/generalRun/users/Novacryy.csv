So back on 2013 I wanted a new Gamertag. I was thinking and watching a documentary on my TV.

I thought "" that Shit must be so incredibly beautiful, you would... Cry. ""

Supernova. Cry. Novacry."

AskReddit,fc6qwig,t3_ega9qc,1577487197.0,"It's 20 % working out, 80% eating.

Yes, as a beginner you will build muscle if you work out. No matter what or how much you eat. BUT you will hit a plateau very quickly. from there on you need to overload your workout and eat according to your goals.

But if you wanna lose fat you gotta be in a caloric deficit. There is no way around that. Don't give me your magic pills, tea in the evening, intermittent fasting bla bla. 
Calories in, Calories out. That's all there is.
 Anything else is just there to help you achieve a caloric deficit.

I've come so far, but my journey is not over and I learned so much. I wish to share that knowledge with people struggling with their body."
