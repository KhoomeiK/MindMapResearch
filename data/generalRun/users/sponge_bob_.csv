the world isn't black and white and at no point did i say or imply it was; if i were to, it would be more like ""either you're solely out there for profit, so you'd cater to the biggest group or you're doing it for fun and maybe what you want is the most fun"".

On the contrary, my main point was that the advice ""Make the game *you* want to play"" is too simplistic; ""depends on your goal"", i feel, is better. To support my opinion i provide two examples - a developer who wants to make money as a priority and one that is doing it for fun. Both show how the first quote is lacking - if you want to maximise money, the game you 'want to play' might have too small a market compared to something else, and if you just want to enjoy yourself there are things you wouldn't 'want to play', but would enjoy working on (similar to your fourth paragraph). They don't cover every generic goal someone might have, but were picked to show my point; if i picked a grey area like someone who wanted a mix of both, making what they 'want to play' wouldn't be too bad advice and i wouldn't be very convincing."

broadly decide the overall gameplay. then research what tools you can use and then pick your preference. do some research into this, but for a 2D game Unity and Godot pop into my mind.

find a tutorial with the game's genre (rogue-like), with an end result similar to what you envisioned if it were brought down to its basics. there will be many such tutorials because it's a popular genre and reasonably easy to make. follow through the tutorial(s) and by the end, you should have enough understanding to make the changes you'd like, as well as provide tips for someone else wanting to do the same thing.

internally is a possibility. as an example, a factory worker that used to pack and mark boxes might oversee the entire production line component involving the boxes. since this person already knows what the expected result is and how to handle others, it's easier to promote them rather than hire a replacement. this does mean that all the other box packers would be let go though which brings up the next point:
