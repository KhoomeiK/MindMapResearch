hapas,fezgo6k,t3_eqnag6,1579457166.0,"You're definitely right. It's in a foreign country, why would they know? I think that's why a lot of people who move to the west don't see or understand the racism their hapa children face."
KotakuInAction,felnjsw,t1_fekrl9w,1579226439.0,"Hey I watch every video he uploads! I gotta do *something* while waiting for code to compile, and there's only so many videos out there."

When did he ever give a timeframe? I never heard him give any kind of estimate."
hapas,fei37l0,t3_ep7snp,1579129282.0,/r/TrueOffMyChest is the subreddit to use. /r/OffMyChest has always been run by idiots.
hapas,fehj9xi,t1_fehged3,1579117681.0,I wonder the crap you must have to filter through on a daily basis...
hapas,fehg1dg,t3_ep5wtg,1579115784.0,Going off the post history I can't help but feel this is a troll or someone pretending so they can act out a fetish.
IsItBullshit,feh91k5,t1_fegnnyr,1579111662.0,"Yeah, and I'm sure that has nothing to do with your expectations and the social situations in which you drink wine. 

There's way more obvious and ready explanations for your perceived difference than something related to the contents of the drink itself."
WinStupidPrizes,feg488y,t1_feek3al,1579076184.0,"It's actually for ruining your own jokes. It's the internet equivalent of immediately explaining a joke after telling it, before anyone has a chance to laugh."
IsItBullshit,feg3wqr,t1_fefu5o5,1579075784.0,"My rational brain says BS, and my (extensive) experience says BS. Any perceived difference is due to your expectations (nocebo effect) and your behavior (how you drink various types of alcohol). Alcohol is alcohol."
theyknew,fecsx5n,t1_fecb61o,1578983366.0,"> Sadly, I’ve had to endure sex with people who watch too much porn

Hey, I watch *way* too much porn but I still know the difference between fantasy and reality. It's not porn's fault: It's poor sex education."

insaneparents,fecjm3y,t1_fec45x6,1578975506.0,It's US unless assumed otherwise almost everywhere on Reddit. Stop being obtuse.
IsItBullshit,fe48zsp,t1_fe45rb0,1578856921.0,"No, it's because he's full of shit. If you're an expert on any topic he covers you can see he really doesn't know as much as he portrays."
AskReddit,fdyup34,t1_fdyqmcg,1578783777.0,I don't blow my nose. On the rare occasion I sneeze and snot comes out I just grab some toilet paper.
AskReddit,fdycg66,t1_fdy0z0q,1578778294.0,"> The comment I was responding to made it sound like people blow their loads instead of their noses which is surely not the case

Hi. I'm one of those people. Never use tissues for noses; I only use them for sex."
wow,fdunko7,t1_fdtg0gz,1578735846.0,Wtf are you talking about. Pet battles get a ton of content every expansion. And during BFA and Legion especially they've been getting a lot of new stuff.
JapanTravel,fdufpn9,t3_en3nt7,1578732414.0,None of the answers to these questions are unique to Japan... Like where the hell is it not rude to film a chef without asking first?
hapas,fdt34pf,t1_fds1ltf,1578711300.0,Good idea to stay away from those places. They're absolute nutters. Not watching porn or masturbating because you feel it impacts you negatively: Cool. But people on those subreddits act like every evil thing in the world is caused by masturbating and that if you stop you'll get super powers. It's a really similar environment to incels.

Is this an open offer? Cause this sounds interesting."
todayilearned,fdq1wow,t1_fdq120w,1578650803.0,Give me some examples then. Cause the only rude person I've seen is you.
todayilearned,fdq0xxq,t1_fdq0tsh,1578649415.0,"Where was anyone shitting on anyone? Most people who speak English as a second language don't do it very well. Same way most people don't speak any second language particularly well. None of the people you replied to were shitting on anyone or being dicks.

Stop looking for fights mate. Chill out"
anime_irl,fdpywj0,t1_fdpx3qe,1578646568.0,It's practice.

japancirclejerk,fdjlilx,t1_fdhvbqx,1578476620.0,"I lived in Shinjuku on $2000 a month, and in my own private apartment no less. Tokyo really isn't that expensive if you're single and don't have a lot of expenses."
justneckbeardthings,fdjkpt2,t1_fdiwz1m,1578475456.0,Yeah ngl that's some top level speech game.

Dude can't even weeb right."
hapas,fdjjtut,t3_elphvo,1578474172.0,"Been here for two years now, and I'd say the sub is the least toxic I've ever seen it."
hapas,fdiqrlx,t3_ellooh,1578448942.0,"It's possible for sure. I don't think this place is toxic or get offended/defensive when issues related to WMAF relationships are discussed. Not trying to say how ""woke"" I am or anything, just saying that people like me (and my partner) do exist. A lot of people get very ""well *we're* not like that"" when the issue is brought up at all, but I'd hope a therapist would be able to realize it's not specifically about them.

And seeing a therapist doesn't make you sound like a ""pussy""."
justneckbeardthings,fdi1k0f,t1_fdhiwfd,1578434102.0,"The ""submissive"" type these dudes want do definitely exist though. I've met a bunch, and I'm engaged to one. I wouldn't call it a good thing though. If you're not a piece of shit it's actually a pretty big problem. Had to work with her on getting her to realize it's healthy to have boundaries and wants/needs. Felt really uncomfortable in the relationship at first, but as she's gotten more assertive and I've learned to read her better things have become better."
ShitPostCrusaders,fdhrzb3,t1_fdgnenk,1578429032.0,The analogy is fine. When you have extra stuff on your body it often all doesn't work properly.
