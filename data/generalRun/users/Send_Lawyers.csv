personalfinance,ffuw1ru,t3_ev6rv7,1580250416.0,"My wife made 25k. She paid $500 in federal taxes. This ate our refund. How do I make sure it doesn’t happen next year?  

The previous year in 2018 her employer withheld $5 of federal tax. And I lost my shit. We filed a W4 and put her as a zero. Attempting to correct the problem for 2019. It did not work. This year they still didn’t withhold nearly enough. I make quite a bit but my withholding is more than adequate to provide a bit of a refund. I like getting the lump sum post the holidays. Because my wife doesn’t pay nearly enough it basically eats half my refund. Or all of it in 2018.

Foodforthought,ffq2gav,t1_ffq1hbo,1580116718.0,The ranking prisoner admiral stockdale was a prolific writer. In his memoirs of a philosopher pilot he talks about how you don’t know anything about how a person will react to solitary until about 3 months. It takes them about that long to get though the stages of grief or whatever people go through. He openly mocked Stanford prison experiments and other judgements on solitary as being far too short.

politics,ffh2mxg,t1_ffgav63,1579921450.0,"40% of the country doesn’t travel, doesn’t have shit for money, brains, or aspirations. No really if the average American makes $73,891 as a family. And has an average Education. Than the further from the mean the worse it gets. The lower you go on that scale the bigger a “loser” you become. Income is directly correlated with education test scores and success in the US. 


As long as Netflix is on and some form of roof is over their head they are going to vote for the racist white guy who likes guns. Because everyone in their life system is a raciest white person who likes guns. 

And the people they vote for will take away their healthcare. They will take away their social nets. Sell off the good government jobs with pensions to private equity firms. Rape and pillage the education budget and say use unregulated charter schools. All while blaming the “libs” for the problems they actively create and profit from. 

And that same 40% will cheer them on. Why?

Because they are morons. It’s pretty simple. They even have a dunce cap they wear to prove it. It’s red and has a slogan you may know."

IAmA,ff47ry6,t1_ff46b6w,1579557395.0,First I’ve heard this explanation. That’s neat. Where can I read more.
AutoDetailing,ff32c0s,t1_ff31yj0,1579531841.0,Thanks!  How would I mask an area with new clear coat? I’ve seen lots of guides on how to fix paint issues but very few on just repairing clear coat.
AutoDetailing,ff2zyj0,t3_erd0yy,1579529930.0,"1.  I have a 996 911 cab. The front bumper and a couple other areas have minor paint chips. The clear coat is clearly chipped but the red paint underneath is fine. A paint pen won’t help as the paint is still there. but how do I fix the damage to the clear coat above the paint. Waxing/buffing has been ineffective. 

2.  Secondly. The lug nuts are in pretty bad shape from both corrosion and failure of the chrome in the lug nut area. I tried Adams polish on the metal/chrome and it helped but was not a miracle worker. Is there anything aside from refinishing I can do on chrome/bolts?

3.  Thirdly. Best way to remove dog hair from any vehicle? The shop vacs don’t work so great. 

Finally really just want to plug that Adams 1/2 polish. It made everything besides the lug nuts look great. Exhaust caps look brand new."
worldnews,fdw75su,t1_fdtwst9,1578755788.0,"That would require evidence. Which the plaintiff has none. Only the assertion that it wasn’t packed correctly. And his word against the TSA.  Who claims they packed it correctly. 

See my other comment for the correct course of action."
worldnews,fdw6ito,t1_fdsbyne,1578755554.0,"No. The terms of your ticket provide insurance. TSA didn’t break your thing the baggage handlers operated by the airline did.  

The Montreal convention covers international flights. 

For a US domestic you have about 1100 coverage for the trip and for international you get about 1600. 

Those numbers are important to know if you travel with expensive things. My snowboard bag has about 6k worth of stuff in it. Were it to be lost or destroyed I only get 1100 dollars. 

The other thing to know is the airlines are on the hook if your luggage is delayed for those same dollar amounts. Fly to Canada and your luggage spends the night at your connection in Dallas instead of in Canada. Congrats go spend $1600 on clothes and toiletries and make a Montreal convention claim with delta. Even when your stuff arrives the next day they pay up. Thanks for the Canada goose parka. It was chilly there. 

Seriously if you fly with nice stuff Insure it or buy it a spare ticket. Better off just ship it a day or two prior via UPS and don’t worry about it."

Everyone pundit Monday morning quarterbacking his policy decisions is stuck in the Obama pre trump paradigm. The rules change when his inter subjective reality is totally different from the entire foreign services reality. 

Like China at Yalu he isn’t worried about casualty numbers. 

This isn’t a pro argument for his current decisions. I’m just tired of reading about current events through a 6 year old lens."
worldnews,fcyoool,t1_fcxpbx1,1578084002.0,"Those are not the same things at all. 

An investigation found Gallagher guilty of tons of violations. So severe he was referred to trial. Convicted of one charge. An attempt to remove his pin was stopped for political reasons only. He is wrong. Was found to have broken rules. And punished. It would have been significantly more severe if the president had not personally intervened. 

None of those things happened on the Vincennes. It’s literally night and day.

Again in stark contrast to the individual in question which the navy was actively trying to remove. And found guilty of actual crimes. 

I’m not going to Monday morning QB the CO but comparing him to an actual war criminal is dumb."
worldnews,fcvzz3a,t1_fcvj820,1578013968.0,"It wasn’t a mistake. From the way the information was presented in the amount of time he had to make a decision he made the right call. 

That the systems in place allowed the kill chain to happen isn’t the COs fault. It’s the people who built and designed the systems. Which after this incident were changed to prevent a repeat. Which has worked for 30+ years. 

This is also why he was never charged or reprimanded. The navy understood anyone in his position was trained and ordered to do the same thing. 

As opposed to you know just murdering people for fun like chief."
worldnews,fcvze8w,t1_fcv1gkh,1578013586.0,"Comparing these two is dumb. One was fully investigated and found to have done “Nothing” wrong. Literally was not charged or punished in anyway. 

The other was investigated tried and convicted of breaking military law. 

I get that it might seem bad to shoot down a plane full of innocent people but he was following standing orders and due to the technology at the time made a mistake. From his point of view he thought he was being shot at and had minutes to live. Read about the tanker war to understand that people in his exact position had been shot and killed in the exact same place. Fortunately the lack of tech that made the mistake possible has been eliminated largely due to his accident and ships don’t blast airliners any more.

Sensario the light installation west of town. Neato but super over priced. I was told we could bring in a picnic basket of food and wine but when we arrived this is not allowed at all. The food and wine they sell inside was total crap and over priced. ($40) for a carafe of $10 wine. So get dinner first if you wanna pay ticket price of $35 a person to look at lights. Also it’s cold. I came prepared for that but some of my party did not so we left rather quickly. 

Tooth and nail vineyard. Ok wine.  neat castle thing. Would be an ok place to hang out and take some photos. But they had a live event on when we arrived at 5pm. and would not do tasting flights. So we each just ordered something different and talked about it. 

Downtown there is a speak easy called 1122 it’s behind the Irish pub. It was pretty cool. The drinks were good. This was actually the best part of the trip because I didn’t feel like paying $15 for a fancy cocktail was a ripoff like the entire rest of the town. 

Overall just a crappy version of Napa and Sonoma with similar prices but way less value. Hope this is helpful."
