Nothing in the problematic statement is implying exclusivity of homelessness, but instead is declaring it is part of a subset of issues for women.

Given the context, it would be in addition to ""homeless is as men's issue"". If you put it in a full train of thought, the only way to write your example would be to say something like ""homelessness is a men's issue and a women's issue too"".

This is not an uncommon problem in militaries because as technological advancements increase, specialization in the knowledge of how the components are built and work increases. You can't realistically, as a military have specialized job roles that are just to fix one specific system. The amount of overhead required in the military for administrative tasks is also high.

PoliticalHumor,ffis4bk,t1_ffi0ojx,1579981331.0,"It's more that they are more deadly compared to other rifles than being over all more deadly. And this has obvious historical backing in the design of assault rifles. I disagree that it wasn't revolutionary. If you look at the period after the development of the first modern assault rifle in the StG44 you see that over the next 10 to 15 years almost all militaries adopted a medium caliber rifle with the same physical design.

The reason for this is because it enabled the practical use of larger detachable magazines in a way that also improved reload speed, improved muzzle control with an over all shorter barrel length compared to previous battle rifles (though larger cartridge rifles like the FAL are still pretty long in a lot of configurations), and decreased time from carry to shoulder by introducing the pistol grip to a medium cartridge rifle. Automatic fire was also important but I'll get to why I don't believe it ultimately was the most important. 

You're right that this was all features that had incrementally been had but when they came together finally towards the end of WWII it was a very important realization.

Now my argument for why automatic fire was not as important, that is based mostly on the US history of the M16 and logistical goals of the US army.

The big thing that a common infantry rifle introduced was the reduction in cartridge types that had to be supplied to an infantry unit. Previously CQB had been the domain of the machine pistol/SMG like the Thompson, while medium engagement ranges were the domain of the battle rifle, and support was provided by an LMG. Moving to a gun that could combine the roles the SMG had also carried out meant a reduction in having to supply pistol caliber rounds to infantry units, and if you got automatic fire from a heavier cartridge you could also get rid of the LMG, reducing maintenance costs. This is why the automatic capability was added originally, to support those two roles in a common platform.

Except there was a problem... While the CQB role was fitted perfectly with this new weapon (and even better as carbine variations appeared) giving every infantryman an automatic weapon introduced ammo waste. Additionally new squad tactics had begun to dictate heavier suppressing fire. The limited thirty round magazine was not enough for this and the weapons tended to overheat and jam. Additionally it added confusing roles to a squad where some men were told to fire auto and some semi auto. The M60, which was the main machine gun deployed with infantry was also heavy, required two men to effectively operate, and again used a different cartridge (7.62x51 NATO).

The US basically slogged through Vietnam with these problems. After the war though a true LMG came into service with the US in the M249. It fired the same NATO 5.56 round that the M16 fired, could be effectively operated by 1 man, and was a proper machine gun from a barrel and feed system design, allowing belts of ammo. This relagated the automatic fire selector on the M16 to being almost never used. Rifleman were taught to conserve ammo by seeing and firing on semi vs. blind suppression on automatic, letting the LMG handle sustained area suppression.

Auto is still available but it's limited to room clearing or additional support if needed, but I know personally many infantry and marines that went their entire deployment and never fired full auto on their rifles except a few times at the range.

In addition, the seasonal flu kills more people each year than this does, averaging 15 deaths per 100k people in the US."

SeattleWA,ffedsrs,t1_ffd1okk,1579844315.0,"Yes, I am sure that the problem with a ton of bystanders getting shot wasn't the fact that criminals were using guns vs. a knife or any other weapon.

These are not mutually exclusive situations. Gun law reform and being tough on criminals can go hand in hand. Reducing the access to illegal firearms starts with reducing the number of firearms entering circulation, most of which are legally purchased."
SeattleWA,ffedodm,t1_ffctzyh,1579844196.0,"Except at the end of the day, the gun entered the system most likely through a legal FFL purchase.

Just because the gun entered the shooters hand illegally doesn't mean the gun entered the system illegally. The problem _is_ guns because illegal guns are widely available due to the negligence of legal gun owners."
SeattleWA,ffedj5r,t1_ffedf1j,1579844055.0,I'm done. You're clearly fucking retarded. You've now circled around to ignore all the previously established points in this scenario and you're arguing in complete bad faith at this point.

Yes, it'd still be possible to make your own gun. Good for them, if they ever are caught with it then they go to prison. I don't see what your point is."
SeattleWA,ffe9r38,t1_ffe9j8x,1579840626.0,"I don't think you are grasping the concept. You remove the injection of new guns, and over time the number of guns available to felons goes down.

Almost all guns in the hands of felons were legally purchased at one point. Over time, yes possibly decades, those guns will slowly circulate out of existence as criminals use them and get caught. It's not a 100% fix but it's better than doing literally nothing."

SeattleWA,ffe8mrd,t1_ffe7zo6,1579839698.0,"Ban on new sales of handguns and rifles, ban on transfers, volunteer buybacks, and a ban on inheritance transfers (collection on death). Registration for all new fire arms purchases (which would just be shotguns at this point) and a retroactive registration list based on FFL background checks.

It'll take 100 years probably but this is something worth doing in my book. I'd also be for licensing and way stricter restrictions on handgun and rifle purchases instead of a ban, including home inspections to make sure they are stored properly in safes."

SeattleWA,ffe7j5t,t1_ffe6psv,1579838805.0,"I don't think you understand basic math. Those countries had little to no firearm deaths to start with. You can't have less firearm deaths if you don't have any to begin with.

The US does have firearm deaths, a lot of them, in fact the majority of homicides are firearm deaths. So if you remove firearms, your logic is that literally every firearm death would be replaced by some other form of committing murder. That is an _absurd_ assumption."

SeattleWA,ffe48du,t1_ffe406p,1579836277.0,OK you're clearly infantry because you're too retarded to understand what a 155 round is.
SeattleWA,ffe43kn,t1_ffe3c4o,1579836179.0,"OK let's do that.

Total number of homicides in the US in 2017: **19,510**  
Firearm homicides in the US in 2017: **14,542**

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/homicide.htm

So even if _half_ of the homicides that occurred by firearms still occurred, you'd have a nearly 37% decrease in the murder rate. And I have no doubts that it'd be far more than half.

So no, you're 100% wrong."
SeattleWA,ffe3dfi,t1_ffe27tu,1579835640.0,"Because I believe that in a rational realistic world where trades need to be made on safety, removing most firearms from society would be a net improvement.

LOL very specific example that is completely disregarding reality. I am sure that 9 year old was happy knowing that his wound was possibly maybe better than being stabbed a bunch of times.

SeattleWA,ffdxhpw,t1_ffdwiqn,1579831368.0,"Except they never had a gun culture like the US to start with. You can't make that comparison seriously.

Also stabbings are a far better alternative to shootings. You don't accidentally stab and kill people like we saw yesterday. If those two had gotten in a knife fight this wouldn't even be news."

Everybody has a right to safety and security in life, that is a natural right. The fact that you think your right to your hobby trumps that is indication that our society is not responsible enough for gun ownership in general."
SeattleWA,ffdkfub,t1_ffcvq4q,1579822767.0,"Yes. If our society can not peacefully own guns then you yourself as part of that society shouldn't be absolved of the responsibility for gun ownership contributing to more lethal violence.

SeattleWA,ffdjkcg,t1_ffdatww,1579822231.0,"No, it really doesn't. I was downtown 10 minutes after the shooting and spent the entire evening down there. I didn't feel threatened or in danger at all."
unpopularopinion,ffcrh8k,t1_ffcd8q5,1579805745.0,"No actually. Generally from a brain development standpoint 25 is really your first year of adulthood. In terms of maturity and basically self identity a 20 year old is closer to a 15 year old than a 25 year old. The number of people I knew or some I still know that changed entirely between 20 and 25 is basically all of them.

If we were going from a strictly medical point of view based on modern understandings of psychological development 25 is the year that you should be allowed to smoke or drink. This is also why a lot of people advocate delaying post primary education until your 20s because if you do an undergraduate degree from 18 to 22 at 23 your brain might have physically changed so much that you no longer have an actual interest in what you studied to do."
