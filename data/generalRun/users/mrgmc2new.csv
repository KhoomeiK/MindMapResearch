unpopularopinion,ffhmchi,t1_ffhlnrv,1579942160.0,Being a dad its difficult to know what to tell my kids. I want them to be happy so I tell them to do what makes them happy. But at the same time I haven't lived like that. I tried to do what made me happy but I wasn't. Then I did something where I helped other people and I was and have never been more fulfilled. So personally I don't think you should aim for happiness. It is momentary and not a constant state and as a result you will always feel like you are failing. At the same time not everyone can do what they want in life so trelling people to do something to be happy isn't the worst advice.

unpopularopinion,ffhjzv5,t3_etknhf,1579938771.0,"As feminism and women's rights have advanced over the years more women have gone away from this traditional role and have sought out lives that resemble what had traditionally been seen as men's roles. Ironically I think we are moving into a time where men are actually starting to talk more about what it means to be a man. Turns out, while there are things we do benefit from, being a man isn't all that great. Working our whole lives to provide for our families while never seeing them isn't a goal everyone aspires to. Getting paid more usually means you sacrifice more. Men are basically cogs in a giant machine that grinds them down their whole lives and then spits them out when they are no longer useful. Of course, men don't talk about this so all anyone sees is that we get more money, or get the top jobs. Nobody asked if those things were something to aspire to. 

I think, in a perfect world, whatever you choose to do should have nothing to do with your gender and everything to do with what makes you personally happy."
