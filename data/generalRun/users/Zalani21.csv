Guildwars2,ffxcmgg,t3_evpop5,1580322405.0,Maybe the Elder Dragons were right about Tyria.
Guildwars2,ffvomaj,t1_ffv68n1,1580269076.0,"Oh wait really? Haven’t gotten round to making one yet.

Shame."
Guildwars2,ffuzass,t3_evce31,1580252219.0,"Man I knew we were gonna get ascended versions. After this past seasons with saving stuff I don’t trust anything anymore.

Hoarder mentality engaged."

classicwow,ffp4q76,t1_ffnf67f,1580086190.0,Pure holy priest pvp is following your friends around so you can poke them with heals while they murder people for you.
justneckbeardthings,ffjvi62,t1_ffj4ln0,1580008091.0,What makes this better is he filed against the wrong Chris Hansen.
Onision,ffip1x9,t1_ffijjdd,1579979174.0,"Yeah from what I’ve been seeing apparently he did lol, explains why our Chris Hansen said he never received anything.

I feel bad for not Chris Hansen, poor dude.

Onision,ffijxyt,t1_ffgdpa5,1579975658.0,"Its a bulletproof vest put on backwards lol, he’s worn it before to vidcon/meetups."
Onision,ffijh3l,t1_ffgfj31,1579975337.0,Funniest part about this is he petitioned the wrong Chris Hansen.
Guildwars2,ffh99gu,t1_ffgklte,1579926803.0,Personally it’s because Factions was my favorite campaign and I’m really curious to see how the area has changed in Gw2 time.
classicwow,fff5mxk,t3_eszen1,1579876319.0,"Currently just farming consumes in general, trying to save up greater shadow prot pots. Turns out grave moss sucks to farm."
classicwow,fff5hcv,t1_ffdim4e,1579876204.0,"I’ve only managed about 4 lotus since the start of classic on my server, my guild has someone who can make them all at least but it’s really not worth it right now. 

Saving mine for the zg healer trinket lol."
classicwow,fff568v,t1_fff2qqu,1579875977.0,"My guild and I went exploring there, turns out I am so bad at that jump they had to make me get killed by a mob and Rez me lmao."
classicwow,fff4w2d,t3_esteto,1579875770.0,"Yeah man I just gave up on bgs and let my rank decay. I wasn’t having any fun with 40min que+quick 6min loss. I can deal with a long queue if the bg was actually fun. I did feel bad for Alliance with they got ditched with like 10~ people  after a premade left. They really got screwed over due to them.

I was going to wait to try again when ab comes out but that new change does look tasty. I can’t wait to play with guildies."
wow,ffe7dkr,t1_ffck47e,1579838680.0,"Please update Shandris, her leveling gear just looks so ugly on her lol."
classicwow,ffdztx4,t1_ffdczh8,1579833054.0,"Heya, what I do here is a mix of Luna healing ui and my own mouseover macros. Ive tried others like clique but I just found it easier to macro stuff and bind it. You just mouseover either on players or right on the raid ui.
 You can do more with them but heres a few I use: 
Flash 3

  # showtooltip
/cast [target=mouseover,exists,help] Flash Heal(Rank 3); Flash Heal(Rank 3); [target=player] Flash Heal(Rank 3)

Magic dispell
 # showtooltip
/cast [target=mouseover,exists] Dispel Magic; Dispel Magic; [target=player] Dispel Magic

PI
 # showtooltip
/cast [target=mouseover,exists] Dispel Magic; Dispel Magic; [target=player] Dispel Magic
/script SendChatMessage(""Enjoy your Power Infusion!"", ""WHISPER"", nil, UnitName(""target""));


I like to make it so you can either cast it by targeting them or mouseover personally. I dont know healbot or Id try to help with that, sorries. I couldnt get the macros to format right but /cast and /script should be on its own line."
classicwow,ffd3voo,t3_esy0gt,1579812911.0,I have a  flash heal 3 bound as a mouse over. It’s dirty but so so useful to have quick.
fatlogic,ffcbmq8,t3_esqqw3,1579795943.0,"No compliment me it makes my lizard brain happy.

(To be serious pretty much the same as the top comments, unless I know the person I just avoid saying anything weight related)"
Guildwars2,ffcbbo7,t1_ffc2yr5,1579795750.0,"Saame, rit was one of my faves."
Guildwars2,ffcb8tb,t3_esl6y1,1579795699.0,"Ah! Nostalgia attack.

I always loved the profession art when creating a new character. Gw2 does that too with the cool backgrounds."
Guildwars2,ffcazme,t3_eej042,1579795536.0,"Man this is helpful in general, ty I’ve been trying to fix what the heck has been messing with packets in all my game downloads."

fatlogic,ff9jws6,t1_ff9acvv,1579714576.0,"I’ve trying out Lose it! This week here, they have a free 7 day trial so it’s worth a try. Just make sure to cancel the sub in settings so you don’t get charged at the end by accident."

classicwow,ff8w6wd,t1_ff6exlw,1579698118.0,Ive gotten like 4 in the entire time of classic so far.
classicwow,ff8ceyw,t1_ff680z7,1579672814.0,Honestly what’s really going to kill guilds is loot and player attrition. Holiday player loss was no joke this past Christmas.
fatlogic,ff3er3y,t1_ff2w7jw,1579539581.0,"Yeah that’s my area pretty much, in town is fine and walkable but if you go outside it’s rural with no sidewalks or anything. Pretty much walk in the road and watchout for cars or walk the edge of peoples yards lol."
classicwow,ff301bp,t1_fez0xaw,1579529994.0,"Yeah as a Horde I’ve pretty much stopped pvping because of the 40min queue+ 6 min bg. It took all the fun out of it, gonna try again when AB comes out."
classicwow,ff2zg0c,t3_eqz43t,1579529496.0,No matter the faction it’s still a bullshit rank grind.

Man I’ve been asking for those outfits since launch when I saw it."
Overwatch,fejleqs,t3_epav4a,1579178848.0,Welp I know what skin I’m going straight for.
wow,fejl7kv,t1_feh1gli,1579178652.0,The thing to remember is that the furry and the nsfw community have the money. Big reason why a lot of artists draw commisions for that even if personally they aren’t into it.
classicwow,fehdh12,t3_ep23s9,1579114293.0,Honestly I’ve stopped pvping atm due to burning myself out on queues. I wanna pick it back up eventually but right now I want nothing to do with rank grind lol.

classicwow,fege7xi,t3_eoq5dq,1579089648.0,Throughout mc we used dkp but now it’s switching to a suicide kings style.
Grobbulus,fecnr23,t1_fdxkez3,1578978546.0,"As someone who used it off and on I really don’t blame them, this kind of stuff will burn you out after awhile. They likely didn’t think this would grow so large when they first started it either. Will miss them though!"
Overwatch,fdrkj64,t1_fdrboeh,1578685772.0,"Yeah I’d love to see a new Ashe one, it’s always fun seeing what they come up with for B.O.B."
Overwatch,fdrjqlx,t1_fdpg9ux,1578685508.0,I would have preferred them to mess with storm arrows or leap tbh. I don’t want his old projectile speed back lol.

Grobbulus,fdqwh26,t1_fdnog8w,1578675840.0,"Honestly same, I don’t correct people when they refer to me as a guy at this point since it just makes everything easier. I’d rather be referred to as a bro then deal with creeps lol."

classicwow,fdqngsh,t3_emoog5,1578670803.0,"Small question about enchants, is it better to have + spirit or +int on the wrist? Priests have been using both in guild so not sure which is best."

wow,fcjmmea,t1_fcif8yw,1577694053.0,"Vanilla-Wrath was the golden era of the Horde for me, part of Cata too. I really lost interest in the faction after MoP era.

Classic has been a treat so far for partly that reason, it’s nice to enjoy the Horde again."
