The Bannerlord graphics will be amazing in comparison to Warband, but compared to something like Warframe (which launched in 2013) it's still pretty bad looking - and that's assuming that the screenshots we've seen are on highest settings, of course.

Again, though, Mount and Blade has *always* looked bad for its time - my go-to example is that Assassin's Creed came out in 2007, 3 years before Warband and only a year before the original Mount and Blade, and Assassin's Creed looks fucking stellar in comparison.

Yes, the ""our enemies aren't really our enemies!"" bit is tired and overdone, the Railroad is honestly probably the worst faction in a Bethesda game. Struggling to think of one more stereotypically boring than that.

Yes Man isn't a character on his own, but rather a vessel for the character to enact their independence. Trying to act like the rest of the factions are faceless (some of the smaller ones, sure, but the major ones all have personality) is just a shameless attempt to bring NV to FO4's level.

And regardless of who you end up physically fighting, the point of the story is to set New Vegas up with who you think will be best.

Is the NCR the best, because they're trying to set up a government and have the following to do so?

Is House the best, because he has experience with New Vegas and seems to have an extremely genuine stake in keeping it thriving and healthy?

Are you the best choice, because you distrust the other figures seeking power?

Is Caesar the best choice, because despite his brutality, he's a proven, skillful leader that could usher in a new age?

Should New Vegas be left to the crime syndicates that make up the majority of its population?

Compare that to FO4;

The Brotherhood are overly violent idealists who don't have the best interest of the territory in mind.

The Institute are overly controlling idealists who don't have the best interest of the territory in mind.

The Railroad are hopeless, ragtag idealists who only care about the synths, and don't have the best interest of the territory in mind.

The Patriots or whatever the hell they're called, can't be bothered to remember - I don't honestly know if there's an ending you can follow where they end up in power, because they were pretty much the worst part of the game and I avoided them as much as possible.

Truthfully, my only gripe with NV is that I wish the Brotherhood was involved more, and that you could do more with them. Otherwise, it story is head and shoulders above anything in FO4."
gaming,ffcvtjc,t1_ffcuy9v,1579808314.0,"I mean, that's just flat out wrong. Fallout 4 has an issue where regardless of who you ally with, it always comes down to being for or against the Institute - whereas with New Vegas, you can choose House, the NCR, Caesar's Legion, you can choose independence, you can choose to wipe the minor gangs out, you can choose to let them thrive, you can help the Brotherhood get a foothold, hell if you get the DLC you can literally choose to re-nuke all of New Vegas and end that shit there and then.

While many of the choices made are ""does this faction live or die?"" the fact that you *can* make that decision means a lot to me, personally. Especially when each of those factions actually has character, history, and a reason to exist, unlike, say, the Railroad, which was bland, generic, and their survival means next to nothing."

Ultimately, I think it comes down to if you want something to intrigue you with a story, or if you want it to be a bunch of surface level enjoyment. FO4 is more immediately satisfying, but seeing through to the end of Parvati's questline was more satisfying to me than anything at all that happened in FO4, Skyrim, Oblivion, or FO3, in my opinion.

I'll take a game with poor gunplay and highly improved writing over a game that's just barely beyond mediocre with everything that it does - which is what all of the Bethesda RPG's are. Skyrim and Oblivion, for melee RPG's, have pitiful combat - it's worse than Mount and Blade, and that game is ancient. For gunplay, I'd expect something more like Apex - and Fallout essentially just makes everything a slow paced point and click. For visuals, I would expect something similar to what Warframe has been able to do - and aside from backdrops and scenery, again, all mediocre.

And he'd blame Luke for failing to keep him in a safe environment. He would deem Luke irresponsible and *too* trusting, which would lead him down his dark path.

I didn't like TLJ because of many things, and Luke is honestly one of my more minor gripes - but with or without Hamil's comments, the original trilogy and literal decades of expanded universe character building (yes, I know it's noncanon, but his actions in the EU overall align with his character better) tells me that that's not a good portrayal of Luke Skywalker, a nearly-stoic Jedi Master turned into a crazy hobo who sucks alien titty milk."

Now, if a classmate had done it, and Luke had failed to defend Kylo and Kylo held him accountable because it's his Jedi Order? That makes more sense.

Really getting sick of the current Reddit trend of ""I don't know why people say the sequels are bad!""

It's because they are. And the reason that hate is so vocal is because many long time fans of the franchise *know* how good Star Wars can be at its best, and so far the only one that wasn't a complete disappointment was The Force Awakens.

summonerschool,fed5dzo,t1_fed44mz,1578999710.0,"I personally leave roleswapping for norms, because I play a lot of norms when with friends. Playing other roles is essential to learning the game properly, but I also feel that having a distinctive main one is much better for you in the long run."
summonerschool,fed3sbk,t1_fed3jvs,1578997378.0,"I would personally recommend against that because learning a lane/role is just as important as learning a champion. Top, mid, jungle, and bot lane all have different things they have to do, and you need to know what to do and when.

This is just my own personal opinion of course - what works for you will work for you. However, I find that, while in other roles I'm often having to rely on vision and educated guesses, when I'm on my main role (top lane) I can pretty much have a sixth sense for when certain things are going to happen and where people are going to be. This is because I've played the role enough to have a general idea of what the majority of players are going to do against me in that scenario.

I'll often roleswap in some normal games if I feel tilted with top lane for whatever reason, but I try to stick to top lane for ranked, with jungle secondary. If I get autofilled anywhere else, I'd rather take the LP penalty for dodging."

Aleister Black needs to be sold like fucking death. He needs to tear a warpath through every single person in his way.

Murphy can eat a few losses to a guy who's the best of the best and then join up with AOP as he did here, which gives him a proper storyline to go through.

You can book somebody weak as long as there's something for them afterwards. Losing a match isn't a death sentence for everybody, but there are some people - like Aleister - who lose their allure after eating losses. Buddy Murphy is a good wrestler, but he doesn't feel like somebody who should be unbeatable."

Glad I picked her up way back when, because honestly now it genuinely feels like my Fiora is unbeatable to anybody else in my elo and if they win, I rarely feel like it isn't deserved. I can deal with an even enjoy losing to a player who just genuinely outplayed me, and I can avoid getting cheesed like 95% of the time now, so overall she's just super enjoyable."

FioraMains,fdxqm7o,t3_enarqx,1578771881.0,"Fiora *doesn't* always finish Hydra right away. However, when she does, it's because all of the components are very solid power spikes for her, and the combine cost isn't anything crazy. That being said, it varies heavily by matchup.

1. You don't always want a Tiamat, and there are plenty of matchups where you want them to shove you in - this would be a situation where you don't rush Tiamat/Hydra.

2. The lifesteal/damage from Pickaxe and Vamp Scepter are very important, and if you're in a matchup where Tiamat early is a good idea, then you may as well combine the item.

3. Even if you are rushing Hydra, you should always have a Phage and boots built before your first item is complete. The movespeed is irreplaceable, and it makes it a cakewalk to proc vitals and your ultimate with those - as well as facilitating escapes from ganks/lost fights.

TL:DR Fiora is not a champion that blanket rushes any full item, and she has a lot of options to build stuff throughout the early laning phase. If you're seeing every single Fiora rush Ravenous Hydra 100% of the time regardless of matchup, you've been watching bad Fiora's."
SquaredCircle,fdv73kr,t1_fdv43wk,1578744031.0,"I mean, you say 'whatever demon is haunting him' when we know damn well what's up with Punk. Dude had a terrible fucking time growing up. Then he found his passion in wrestling, and he ended up in a company that stomped out that spark, and killed his passion. Sure, he gained things along the way - AJ, lots of money, AJ, relative fame, a comfortable life, AJ, one of the most significant turning points jn wrestling in recent history, *and* AJ - but when something you love is turned to something you despise and can't stand, it's hard not to be bitter.

I think, deep down, Punk does want to make an in-ring return. But he can't, because every time he even thinks about stepping into a ring, he gets that ""get me the fuck out of here"" feeling again, and I can't blame him for that."
