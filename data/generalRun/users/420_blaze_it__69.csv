vegan,fgmknej,t1_fgmc331,1580926505.0,"I get your point, but saying “the system is bad” doesn’t do anything, it’s a way of saying “I’m not the problem”.
And generally everyone doesn’t own a business, most people work for someone.
You can’t tell me that the 1% is just trying to get by. If you’re a slaughterhouse owner, you probably have enough money to start another business."
vegan,fglitph,t1_fgl7r57,1580899958.0,"I don't think that slaughterhouse workers are the bad guys here, I mean they're just trying to get by.

The real bad guys here are the sloughterhouse owners."
vegan,fglippa,t1_fgl2hsn,1580899796.0,"My response to someone using that kind of hunting in a ""why are you vegan"" conversation is ""supermarket meat wasn't hunted, it was produced"".

However if were talking hunting as a separate topic, then I'd say that it's okay, as long as it's purely to keep the nature in balance and not used as an excuse to just go hunting and killing whatever moves"

teenagers,fg6mljc,t1_fg6malj,1580571887.0,"And if you’re thinking about people who want to teach lions not to eat meat and feed their cats only vegan stuff, then that’s just a small part of all vegans.
It’s kinda like with feminists, the ones that go too far are the loudest and the ones that actually make sense are not being heard"
teenagers,fg6malj,t1_fg6lm82,1580571673.0,"Well, that’s a common misconception about true vegans.
It’s not like vegetarianism which is just not eating meat. It’s not just an eating pattern, it’s about choosing plant based alternatives because of ethical and sometimes environmental reasons.
A lot of vegans are “junk food vegans”, they don’t care about their own bodies enough to have a healthy diet, but they don’t eat animal based products for other reasons."

Edit:
To you all that missed the point:
I’m not saying that all smart people are antisocial, in fact I’m not even saying that those other skills are purely social
What I’m saying is, it’s better to be a B and C student whose life is not all about school, than be an  A student whose whole life is school.
Obviously some people are gonna have straight A’s and also do stuff outside of school, but that’s not the point"
