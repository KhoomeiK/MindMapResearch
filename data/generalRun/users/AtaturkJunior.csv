worldnews,fff6g8l,t1_fff5v3b,1579876915.0,"Darkness based? I might not quite understand what You are saying, but if we compare the ""real world"" in the Matrix, the way AI harvested people while keeping them satisfied-ish inside the matrix and the way we industrially grow animals, make them live in despair their whole lives just to kill them off and one of the reasons it's okay because they are inferior to us and it's convenient..
 movie was emotionally dramatic, for sure, but conceptually, is there THAT much of a difference? Is our evolution world darkness based?"

AnalogCircleJerk,ff6nim4,t1_ff6ls3j,1579630976.0,"You might be right about that fashion part. But I think there is some sort of line with ""experimentation"" he crosses. Usually you can see a unfulfilled potential in a shot, something that might work out and didn't. But especially in this video? Nothing, nada."
AnalogCircleJerk,ff6h3wl,t3_errted,1579627069.0,"The way Willem works baffles me. His portraiture is so good, very contemporary in a good way. Especially those rapper guy pictures with that direct circular light.
 But then I get weirded out by stuff he shoots in some of these videos, especially this one. Almost none of the pictures I would even take with a phone. To me, wasted film. And I feel like I am the only one."

CatastrophicFailure,ff2qyyh,t1_ff2p9cf,1579520111.0,Terminal velocity still applies. Meteors are punching through atmosphere because of their initial speeds while in space and those are incomparable though.

Noot really how that works."

Wellthatsucks,fegq9rp,t1_fegi1cq,1579099991.0,"I have sprinters legs and tight-ish fitting jeans is mostly what I wear. The cloth is stretchy and confines to the shape of the leg after a couple of weeks. Regular pants have little to no stretch usually and they pull and I have to do that old man pant tuck upwards when crouching. If you wan't to feel manly (somehow) with baggy pants, be my guest, bet there is nothing more comfortable in them."
