Sorry I don’t know the exact one."
AskReddit,fgo9m3d,t3_ezm7h9,1580963240.0,"I screen shot an argument with my now husband and accidentally sent it to him. 

I also once accidentally texted my sales manager complaining about him messing up a deal over a low trade number. He took it well and I told him I damn right I was angry."
AskReddit,fgo9eck,t3_ezm7jr,1580963082.0,Someone did the napoleon dynamite thing and trailed an action figure out the window. But it hit someone’s car and the lady caught up to the bus and freaked out at the kid.
Sims4,fgo6u81,t3_ezm7td,1580961216.0,Maybe you could opt for a refurbished laptop or desktop pc?
unpopularopinion,fgo6hkt,t3_ezm86b,1580960962.0,I live in Minnesota and it’s infuriating. When I see some ass hat on their phone while I’m driving i go out of my way to avoid them. We have a hands free law now. But there needs to be MUCH stricter punishments for this. Honestly I think people who do this should have their license suspended or cancelled if they don’t stop.
birthcontrol,fgo63s4,t3_ezm8jg,1580960690.0,I wouldn’t risk it before a month. I have nexplanon and they said to stay on my last month of the pill since I was going to be having unprotected sex. Just to be safe.

AskReddit,fgmcbls,t3_ezcgvw,1580921854.0,"A lot of times I’ve done my research on the company and I mention that I like what I’m hearing on Glassdoor. The culture of the company matches my values. I’m excited about the position I’m interviewing for. If there is opportunity for growth I mention that I like that. If they do any kind of charity work I mention that. 

That kind of stuff. See if what the company does matches you as a person. I know it’s really that you like the job, can do the job, and need the money. But they already know that so they want to hear something else."

AskReddit,fgl5qam,t1_fgkz6z8,1580882916.0,"I’d also expand on the maintaining part. 
Maintained register via daily checkout balance to ensure there were no discrepancies. 

The money handling part is good to talk about. But so is the customer facing part of it. You get loads of customer experience being a cashier. You have to know how to handle angry people and work quickly and concisely. That can all be summarized onto a resume and will do a great deal to boost it."
AskReddit,fgl51bg,t3_ez3r8i,1580882250.0,"I always wanted to be a plastic surgeon that specialized in post mastectomy breast reconstruction. Or to be one of those doctors that helped kids with cleft palates in third world countries. Doctors Without Borders. 

Still want that. But I injured my hand and thus am unable to safely do any procedure as I have lost a lot of fine motor skills and have constant pain. Ended up in a completely different field.

Edit. Now... I’m on my path of what I want to be. Since it’s obviously changed. I want to own my own dealership."
AskReddit,fgl2p0y,t3_ez3rf3,1580880150.0,Hard work and determination. Living below my means. Knowing when to quit.
AskReddit,fgl2j8s,t3_ez3rhu,1580880011.0,"I remember babysitting my sister and trying to teach her simple math before kindergarten. I asked her what two plus two was and she raised her hand and goes ‘oh oh, I know! I’m a ducky!’"
AskReddit,fgl2eec,t1_fgkzanm,1580879899.0,I see I’ve met a like minded individual. I’m glad to see this response.
AskReddit,fgl2c9y,t3_ez3rns,1580879847.0,"I mean. Yes and no. You can certainly become wealthy. It’s all about paying off debt, investing. Making wise business choices. Flexing your delayed gratification muscle and moving forward."

AskReddit,fgl1dr1,t3_ez3sof,1580879022.0,"My roommate locked me in my room to detox because I was too afraid to go somewhere and couldn’t afford it. I think the first three days were the hardest. I thought I was going to die. I remember crying in pain and a lot of water, pb&j’s and vomiting. 

After that, it was removing myself from the people I used with, going to NA meetings and constant chanting of the serenity prayer. I basically had to uproot and change my entire life. I moved and completely disconnected from my old group without warning, I left the job I was at where I started using (pro tip, don’t work in a ‘night’ club). And sought counseling. That was big. 

I still get triggered when I see references to this drug on tv because they make fun of it often. I used to cringe and turn off the TV or leave the room. I still get that jump in my chest but I’ll be six years sober this year. You gotta take it one day at a time and surround yourself with support."
relationship_advice,fgl0jsf,t3_ez3svv,1580878347.0,He is probably like me where I read things nod and go back to what I was doing. Only to realize a day or... five later that I forgot to reply.
