BrandNewSentence,fdhyy14,t1_fdh436e,1578432705.0,"I don't know anybody who does not take unsuccessful suicide attempts seriously. My interpretation of a ""cry for help"" is ""I'm miserable enough to risk suicide (through ODing on pills, for example) and if I don't get help might actually do it next time."" This should be taken super seriously."
BrandNewSentence,fdh153r,t1_fdgyxhp,1578413113.0,"No, your implication 
that suicide attempts is the statistic that matters is the one that is misleading.  Both men and women are fully competent at killing themselves if they are serious about it.  Most female attempts are not true attempts at all but ""cries for help."""

holdmyfeedingtube,fdfk6in,t1_fdfe041,1578363613.0,Women have much less upper body strength and lifting heavy weights over your head is risky for men and downright reckless for women.
arizona,fdfjuva,t3_ehzsuf,1578363402.0,She claims two separate officers sexually assaulted her in a very short period of time.  Odds of this actually happening are extremely low.  She also had outstanding warrants from another county.  Sorry honey you don't get a pass for being female.

RedditForGrownups,fdf9w5j,t3_el1sgn,1578356710.0,"Obviously we don't know your life story, but IF you made regrettable mistakes when you were young that led to you being childless and partnerless - you can always share your insight with younger women as an example of what NOT to do.  This would be a fulfilling and positive way to give back to society and help girls avoid a similar tragedy."

LifeProTips,fdcbp1b,t1_fdcb2e3,1578271093.0,"I taught my son to not manipulate girls into sex.  I taught my daughter to not manipulate guys by using  her sexuality to extract non-sexual favors from guys.  When it comes to sex,  romance, and power, men and women BOTH have a moral obligation not to abuse their relative advantage in any particular scenario."
