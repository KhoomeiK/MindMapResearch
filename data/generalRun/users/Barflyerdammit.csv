YouShouldKnow,ff8ivjq,t1_ff8awkt,1579680522.0,"Ok, a lot to unpack here.  

First, your routing.  If you split it into two parts (yourself by going direct, or by SkipLagged) you are getting two separate tickets. If you do the same thing on Expedia, doing two separate searches, you get the exact same results: just under $100 each way on a good day before seats, luggage, carry one, etc.

When you search as one itinerary, you get a different set of results.  Why?  The same reason United sued SkipLagged: separate (or partial) tickets one a single itinerary is a logistical and contractual nightmare, and a potential PR and CS disaster.  Spirit has no obligation to Frontier and vice versa.  There's no interline agreements that say they'll check your bags all the way through without having to claim and recheck them, or that if your Frontier flight is late your connecting ticket will be honored on a different Spirit flight without having to buy a new ticket on the spot for full walk up fare.  Most wise fare hackers will leave a ton of extra time between those connections to accommodate this potential problem.  Because of all those restrictions, the legacy carriers don't need to compete head to head, and can price at whatever the market will bear.

That's not the software messing with you, that's the Revenue Management department messing with you.

Regarding the GDS systems going away, it's not just offline travel agencies that use the GDS systems.  The airlines run them, both Expedia and SkipLagged use them.  They are the conduit between most airlines and their distribution networks.  They're not as ubiquitous as they used to be, but there's no way Nok Air in Thailand is going to maintain a) functional booking software on its own and/or b) direct API connections with the 35000 websites which sell their air travel. 

 If an airline res software goes down for even a few hours, that's catastrophic on a lot of levels.  Not many are willing to take a chance on new, unproven technology.   And for sales, a middleman is always needed, and the GDSs are pretty well entrenched in that respect, too.  

We've strayed pretty far from the original idea that your mom can buy the same ticket from Dallas for less than what you're seeing in NY.  Did I misunderstand that claim?"
The_Mueller,ff8dru9,t1_ff8d3b0,1579674270.0,"Ted Cruz didn't get disbarred, so I'mma say...not if you're GOP."
YouShouldKnow,ff86p2d,t1_ff7wbns,1579667528.0,"Your two ticket strategy is a good one--well done.  And you can stand by your statement, but I work with the GDS software itself and I promise you that what you're claiming is not true.  

Given the hundreds of airports and hundreds of thousands of flight combinations, AA doesn't give that much of a crap about adjusting the pricing for one specific route for your specific outbound city.  And if they did, the software platform was built in the 1960's and couldn't do anything about it anyway.  And if it could, Skiplagged.com would just circle around it anyway by offering to issue your ticket in Texas, or maybe even Bosnia, Colombia or Egypt (where the local governments have a prohibition of certain types of airline taxes.)

Of course the OTAs want to make money, but there is a strong disincentive to offer a higher price when the competition won't.  Their interest is in offering the lowest price, because you're buying a commodity and will patronise whoever sells you the cheapest fare--it's the same plane, so you don't care who you buy it from.

The money an OTA makes on selling a plane ticket is a fraction of what they make selling you the travel insurance or hotel.  Even the $25 airport shuttle voucher has a higher commission than the average plane ticket."
YouShouldKnow,ff7ot6n,t1_ff6yhm9,1579654709.0,"I know you're getting downvoted, but they do write the software to allow for different pricing based on the country you're buying the ticket.  If you're in Mexico and Mom is in Dallas, you might be right.  If you're both in the US, you might be doing something wrong.  PM me if you need tips on figuring that out."
YouShouldKnow,ff6k3su,t1_ff6j3gk,1579628898.0,"Scraper sites like Kayak and Momondo make it easy to compare who has the lowest price online, and claims against those guarantees are expensive to process. You're buying the exact same product no matter which site you book with, so right now no one is going to risk showing a higher price if they're aware of it.  I've spent 20 years working for OTAs and GDS systems.  Except for a couple of discount carriers who don't redistribute their fares, we're not able to dynamically price at an individual level yet, but we're working on it and getting closer.  It'll probably never happen for hotels, though."
YouShouldKnow,ff6gzlv,t1_ff6enf7,1579626996.0,"No, it's a persistent myth.  There are some hotel websites which will geocode to decide which hotel to display first (high income areas get the more expensive hotels shown at the top of the results) but nearly every hotel site has a ""best price guarantee."" They can't simultaneously offer that and fuck with the pricing by tracking you."
YouShouldKnow,ff6gk8j,t3_erwfpk,1579626731.0,"This is absolutely a lie for plane tickets.  Here's why: the websites have zero ability to set the price of a ticket.  It's given to them from a feed provided by one of three software companies.  They're contractually obligated to sell at the prices fed to them.  They're entitled to slap extra fees on top of that, but they must disclose them.

Even if you don't believe the mechanics behind the screen, why the fuck would one website charge you a higher price when they know their competitors will offer you a lower one?

Now, airfares are ridiculously complex, and the GDS software behind it is running on a platform designed in the 1960's. That's why that one time your cousin looked in incognito mode and found a better fare.  It's unreliable, but it's not evolved enough to track you across multiple distribution networks and thousands more distributors."

If you say something like ""owls caused 9/11"" then I'll disagree and downvote you.  After 3 years of batshit craziness from the dementia and Adderall riddled crazy old man in the white house, there's no rational debate left that he's not fit for public office."
AskReddit,fdm4ps9,t3_em3q2j,1578539738.0,"I was on a 10 hour drive with my brother talking about FB targeted ads.  He didn't believe the mic could be activated.  I didn't have FB on my phone.

So for most of the 10 hour trip, I slipped the term ""little girls clothes"" into the conversation.  

Three days later the ads were popping up in his feed."

AskReddit,fdfd32w,t3_el3h8g,1578358854.0,"I worked in a job where I would get a dozen or more influencers contacting me daily.  We could never trace even one to a sale, and they were the whingiest, most entitled lying sacks of shit I dealt with on a regular basis.  Worse than most actual celebrities.  I'm still waiting for my former company to be bankrupted by the army of ""influencers"" who said they were going to destroy us.

We also did some outbound marketing to a few influencers that we knew had huge followings among our target market.  Bottom line: if you're big enough to get free shit, we'll contact you."
