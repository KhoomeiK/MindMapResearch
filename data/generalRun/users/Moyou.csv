2meirl4meirl,fferioe,t1_ffeqnky,1579861970.0,"It just sucks because I'm pretty sure it's something I was born with. At least the predisposition to develop social anxiety. Since I was a kid, I felt like I was constantly having to brute force through it, basically.

Maybe it wouldn't be this bad if I'd gotten help earlier, but my parents never cared. They made it worse if anything. I know help is still possible even now, but I don't really know how to go about it, or even if I want to bother trying at this point. I'm tired. Sorry for ranting!"
2meirl4meirl,ffeq6fl,t1_ffeplb0,1579859974.0,"I really wish I could do what you do. I think I'm the type of person who gets easily affected by other people. I was the ""painfully shy"" kid and boom, now it's social anxiety."

2meirl4meirl,feprlwp,t1_fepna6i,1579328918.0,"I have my older sister who is about the only person who cares at all, and I do love her dearly. There are things I like... But ultimately, I don't care about leaving everything behind."
2meirl4meirl,fen0sil,t3_epfaib,1579274414.0,I fucking hate being alive. I just can't see any point in carrying on. Literally the only thing stopping me from ending it is the fear of a botched suicide attempt.
wholesomebpt,feh0g4w,t3_ep16wl,1579106545.0,"My dad's go-to method was always to give the silent treatment, after getting angry and yelling of course. Even if he was mad at my mom, he'd ignore me and my sis too. It really messes with a kid's mind."
pokemon,fegvre5,t1_fegj8ym,1579103627.0,Thanks! I used Clip Studio Paint :)

socialanxiety,fdm3arp,t1_fdm1a61,1578538795.0,"I just hate when it's ""pick your own group"" and then you get left out. And then the teacher drops you into a group of friends... hoo boy."

ATBGE,fdjbh0w,t1_fdjad8q,1578464234.0,He was referring to his previous post of the flea bag on this sub. The pic he used wasn't his either.
ATBGE,fdj6ent,t1_fdj2e9q,1578459738.0,"He even put ""my flea bag"" in the title as if he owns it just for posting it"
