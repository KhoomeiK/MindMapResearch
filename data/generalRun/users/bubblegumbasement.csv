relationship_advice,felc2oo,t3_epm51b,1579218672.0,"I'm a little concerned that your brother encouraged you to enter a relationship with his wife's sister. That's a bit of a red flag for me, dont know why.
 I'd strongly consider seeking legal advice and if it comes to it, involving the police. I know your living situation is tense right now, but letting things boil under the surface won't help anyone. 
Also a little concerned as to why H hasn't gone to the police. Not trying to victim blame but in this case, it's a little off-putting. She told your family members, so what is she expecting to happen next? Sexual assault allegations are extremely serious. I dont know if things were taken out of context or not, but legal consultation is probably one of your best shots for resolving the situation. Keep it lowkey so your family doesn't find out, as they may take it as a sign of admission and guilt. At this point, look out for yourself first and foremost, since it seems your family is not listening to your side of the story fairly."

The reason my account was so empty beforehand was because I'd just transferred a bunch of my funds to a deposit and first month of rent since I'm planning to move out soon. I realize the paycheck bouncing isnt my mom's fault but I never gave her permission to take money out of my account ."
AmItheAsshole,fdppolg,t1_fdpkje5,1578635839.0,I currently do not pay rent or any bills since I'm planning to move out soon.
