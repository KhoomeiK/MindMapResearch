Again, all the women who sued were GDP.

MomPov,fffzudw,t1_fffym7o,1579895409.0,">What you're arguing for or against is what we dont really know.

Yes, and what we don't know is if MomPov is guilty of bad behavior or just being part of the ownership group, who all get sued together.

Unless you have other information.

EDIT: I just read six articles online about the lawsuit.

* All the women who sued were GDP girls who were between the ages of 18 and 23

* MomPov is not mentioned once"
MomPov,fffxme2,t1_fffvvz0,1579894028.0,"If the women are having a bad experience, why would they recommend their friends? Who show up and shoot a scene?

If MomPov was operating as badly as GDP, you would have heard about it on the net.

Not that every woman might have a great experience, but that dozens of women were having bad experiences. It would have been mentioned in the GDP lawsuit articles online.

This is only because they're owned by the same company. You would know that because you can see James as the stunt dick in some of the earlier GDP scenes."
MomPov,fffup1f,t1_ffaknm6,1579892194.0,"That's GDP.

MomPov gives models access to their site in advance.

That's also why they get the models to say everything was ""great"" working with them.

Grown women aren't going to take the abuse and have more resources than 18 year old girls, who have trouble fighting back."
