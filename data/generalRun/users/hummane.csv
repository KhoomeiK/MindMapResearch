I go through sex for the intimacy and cuddles. It makes my partner happy and I'm happy. And sometimes it doesn't take long lol.

Take anal sex never wanted it then after awhile but the bullet and find myself as a top I don't feel that much sometimes but I enjoy the pleasure I give so much more.

Surprise yourself! Stretch your limits. And don't just do it once as chemistry with the other person changes things so much."
askgaybros,ffhpvkf,t3_etnseh,1579947555.0,He's your addiction. And your relationship honestly sounds toxic. If you're moving away soon then I please save yourself any further heart ache and stay away. It will be alot like quitting a drug. You'll suffer withdrawal feelings and pain but it will pass. Because if you continue you will inflict so much more pain on yourself and him. How do I know? I went through a similar experience that wasted a few years that cost me my confidence and self esteem.
askgaybros,ffelzl4,t3_estrrr,1579853776.0,"I think of you get hit on by an older dude don't think less of yourself you don't need the validation of others. If it triggers strong feelings on you it says more about your self esteem then anything else. 

When I was younger I used to be hit on by older guys and thought I was quite unattractive or only worthy of their attention. That I was ugly on some way. Iwas always looking to be picked up instead of making the first move. 

Turns out I was hot and some guys were too shy to ask me out. So it surprised me later to find I could pull the stereotypical hot guy. Most encounters left me a little cold as I had not much self esteem and bought into the myth that attractive people are worth more than unattractive ones. Also the arrogance and false sense of confidence some had.. They were also deeply insecure.. Probably as insecure as I was. I also felt a pressure to date Caucasian men as our society was fairly racist. And our media very white. 

I've always been attracted to different kinds of guys and now that I'm older I really like that difference more. It's not because Asians or blacks are second rate.

As for age when you get older you don't feel older inside and if a young guy breaks the stereotype and finds you attractive it's amazing. Some Asian friends often ask me if an older man they see is attractive. Most times they find the guy hot. I usually have a different opinion. Which surprises them. We all are attracted to different types not just the stereotypical white gym bod man. 

I went out with a younger Asian man. He was extremely beautiful and he brought me back to life. I felt so vibrant again for sometime. But had to fight an internal stigma that I wasn't good enough or attractive enough. That people would judge our age difference. Most people thought we were a great couple which surprised me. But I never truly felt comfortable. And it shocked me at how old I looked in photos with him. Up until then I kind of didn't see that I was 47.

He would take me out to dinner and we would fight as to who would pay. He wanted to. And most times won. 

Of course there are other reasons why older men go for younger Asians and black men but its not always what you think. 

I also get hit on by white young guys. Ultimately it's chemistry that wins me over not race or even looks."
askgaybros,ff54ocx,t3_erifdo,1579580140.0,"Your reaction is understandable and rather human. Hugs. 

We are all very flawed people doing things often times not realising they are bad or hurtful. We lie often for lots of reasons and in your case it is more likely to save you from feeling less special. Which is ironic because that's exactly what you are feeling. 

The important thing was you were feeling special and loved before you read his messages. And now you don't. Ask yourself what was it that made you feel loved because really his feelings seemed to move so strongly towards you that he chose you. And you chose him. And felt strongly for him. So change the way you think and build your relationship on the present. See that out of all these other guys he wants you as he stopped talking to others when you were together. It's hard and feels so unfair at the moment but really it's your perception. 

I don't know if this is helpful to you but what your boyfriend did was normal. And there are so many guys that just don't want a relationship or date he did and its very difficult to find another person who feels the same. I understand that you were in a relationship at the time you 2 were hooking up. 

It sounds like you haven't had that much experience with being single to be able to walk in his shoes to understand that his actions have very little to do with you and to judge yourself and worth based on this is just unfair to yourself and your relationship. 

So decide to 
*Confront him to make yourself feel better and possibly destroy his trust so you can prove your truth 

*continue to feel like a second or third choice and not feel so special and ultimately destroy your relationship with doubt

*forgive him in your heart, focus on your present with him."

askgaybros,ff2qhe7,t3_er42l4,1579519400.0,"Sorry to hear the abuse you've received. I was always so happy when I held my partner's hand. After overcoming so much hatred of myself and thinking I'd never find love. There was no way anyone was going to stop me from acting like any hetero couple in public. 

It was worth the abuse.. And no one was going to make me feel less than normal. I couldn't change their attitudes. But I could change the way I felt about those abusing us. 

I felt whole and when we were together I didn't really see much around me but him. Whenever we experienced abuse (where I was living at the time they were pushing to have homosexuality decriminalised it was successful.. The reactions were very different. From being spat at by people in cars driving by. To being punched in the stomach by a random passer by.. To being surprised by a total stranger who I thought was going to bash us, give us a bunch of flowers )

I felt sorry for the people that abused us. They knew nothing different then the way they were brought up. I think I suppressed any feelings of being hurt as it was kind of expected that they would be abusive. Mostly I was just so proud to have a boyfriend and one as brave as I to walk down the mall holding hands and kissing. There were many many more people that had no reaction.. Also as I wasn't looking for a reaction so my focus wasn't on the people around us.

Change your hurt into pity for those who abuse you. You being happy and not reacting is the best revenge.

Good luck!"
gaybros,ff2paq1,t3_er985y,1579517630.0,Awww so happy for you! Where did you meet?
askgaybros,fevhgbh,t1_feqn8eo,1579397497.0,"I know right! When I was a kid I only really knew disfunction as my parent's friends were the same as my parents. Guilt.. shame.. bashing..

So was relatively happy. Didn't really know any better. 

Then we got new neighbours. They were a wealthy family but down to earth. They spoke lovingly to their children never hit them and supported them emotionally. Also no religion! Looking at their life depressed me. Those kids were so care free.

Oh well what doesn't kill us makes us stronger"
askgaybros,feqmx01,t1_feqebju,1579343700.0,"Thanks for sharing your experience I feel the same. 

When I knew more about the world I just thought what sort of person could I have been raised in a family that had no religion. Have a childhood and teenage years with no guilt. And imagine having a family that accepted and supported your identity. Wow."
islam,feoz77i,t3_epyy6f,1579308583.0,"You are an amazing strong young man. You have held your head up high and spoken respectfully to those that do not share your views.

For those that are doubting this young man's faith and telling him that he has little faith giving examples of Allah's accomplishments. I ask you all to ask Allah why Muslims are persecuted around the world. Why the lands of Palestine Iraq and others are destroyed that poverty exists. All with no intervention from Allah despite what was written many many years ago. Allah has not intervened.

Stop persecuting this young man and support his bravery to speak his truth knowing that he has many against him.

Support him!"
askgaybros,fegfm44,t3_eor09f,1579091123.0,I'm very much the same as you. Mine came from exploring different guys at a sauna. And incredibly surprised about how amazing sex was with people who I thought or society thought was ugly. I still get guilty twinges and feelings of what will people think of me if I hook up with this unconventionally hot ugly guy.. How strange that we are kind of brainwashed that people with certain features are more attractive than others and what we see tries to dominate our other senses that also turn us on.
askgaybros,fegf3px,t3_ep1c7i,1579090607.0,I know this will sound brutal. But I just got some antiseptic and some surgical sissies from the chemist and snipped it myself. Hurt a little bled a little but at least I didn't tear it painfully during sex or wanking
selfimprovement,fege0nf,t1_feg5pkl,1579089420.0,It's still an emerging science and it looks like the waste products aren't the best reflection of what's going on in your digestive system. Ie there are different microbiomes in your gut then in your large intestine and whether the bacteria present are those that are being expelled from the body. All very interesting
jobs,fegcjvp,t1_fdnoxwl,1579087683.0,That would be great! Always open to new friends
