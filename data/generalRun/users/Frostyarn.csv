The one at 22 was a no-brainer. The one at 33, was with my husband. I thought being married, a homeowner, a 15 month old, that those factors would push me towards keeping it.

The second the word â€œpregnantâ€ flashed, I yelled â€œfuckâ€ and called my husband, then planned parenthood. I wasnâ€™t sure if I ever wanted a second baby but I for sure didnâ€™t want two so close together, by accident.

It was a quick, simple procedure, no regrets at all. When my son was 3.5 we decided to have number 2 and I was pregnant that month. I thought Iâ€™d feel guilty about having had an abortion and then planning a pregnancy but I felt totally fine. Still do.

Make a T chart with reasons you want to continue the pregnancy and reasons you want to end it. The decision will be clearer when youâ€™ve put it on paper.

Most of the videos where a reference material was created has a google docs link to download and print out so you can play along at home.

Thoughts on Dharma: They have a lot of redundant blues and reds, some of the colors fizz, gel, cake, separate or bleed no matter what you do. A well performing dye might have a bad batch and then go back to working flawlessly. Dharma does not mill to a high standard and itâ€™s not a great dye brand for newbies, who often attribute problems with a bad dye batch to themselves and their inexperience.

I personally dye on pro chem washfast acid now and teach on it as well. I started dyeing in 2008 and the colors look identical and perform identical all these years later.

Jacquard is overpriced and a small range of colors (40 vs Dharmas 86 and pro chems over 100). I know in Europe thatâ€™s all you can get and high import fees make other brands hard to come by."

Bipolar isnâ€™t a gene you have and 100% of the time contract it. Itâ€™s activated by high amounts of stress and unpredictability in early childhood, that they think triggers the expression of the gene.

My main gig is yarn but Iâ€™ve been obsessed with cg method for a year and a half now. I didnâ€™t even know I had curly hair- I just had frizz to the sky and the driest nasty old Halloween wig hair.

Fine hair works with this technique too, mix your gel with water and use a volumizing foam or mousse so it doesnâ€™t weigh you down, and donâ€™t style dead wet, let it air dry to 50% first, then product and diffuse."

I used Naviâ€™s hair cream, gel and oil.

I put the hair cream in sopping wet, brush, then individually twist 1â€ clumps of hair into curls, scrunch the twists with gel, diffuse upside down without moving the dryer in 4 minute increments, then scrunch with hair oil.

My top section is S pattern waves, underside is barrel curls. This allows me to match textures and get away from using a curling iron on the weird bits.

While I agree that her decision to skip plan b was wildly inaccurate and irresponsible for a nurse, you need to chill on your rage. This woman didnâ€™t trap you with baby #1 - you didnâ€™t use protection and youâ€™re living that decision today. And now you have to live with the decision to not use protection again - whether itâ€™s your lack of confidence in her, or the possibility of baby number 2. You had every opportunity to prevent conception and that rage you feel is misdirected at her, when itâ€™s really meant for you and your carelessness. You know damn well how this could happen, so does she, to take that risk after multiple unplanned conceptions is literally playing Russian roulette.

You need therapy, a daycare or preschool or Montessori, and a vasectomy. Donâ€™t wanna wear a raincoat, stop going out in the rain. Planned parenthood provides them for free on a sliding scale, cash cost is $600

abortion,fdbw20z,t3_ek9enq,1578262773.0,"Hi! Iâ€™m in recovery, 11.5 years sober now, had 2 abortions I never regretted.

When someone wants to stay sober, thereâ€™s nothing in the world that will make them use. When someone wants to use, thereâ€™s nothing in the world that will stop them.

Your abortion is his excuse to relapse.

By the way, kids are waaaaay more stressful than the psychological understanding heâ€™s experiencing. If he canâ€™t handle your abortion without using, howâ€™s he gonna handle the cost of daycare, medical care, screaming all night every night for six months etc? Kids donâ€™t get or keep people sober, but the stress of them leads a lot of people to relapse.

You need to move on from him, heâ€™s gums need a minimum of a year sober and intensive therapy to even begin to be ready to be someoneâ€™s boyfriend. Please consider that this relationship has no future with someone loaded and on a hair trigger for relapse."

abortion,fc7aq6f,t1_fc5xn4k,1577502040.0,"Oh man, sounds like youâ€™re between a rock and a hard place.

But one thing Iâ€™d say is, an abortion IS taking responsibility for your actions. Children are NOT the negative consequence of sex. That is a Christian guilt trip theyâ€™ve been selling since the dawn of time.

No kid deserves to be born into a situation where they arenâ€™t desperately wanted between two partners that created them with intention. I had a fucking horrible childhood, which is the norm and the natural consequence of having children just because you got pregnant. Itâ€™s soooo rare that it actually works out beneficially for the parents and kid. My mom had 4 oopsie babies who all need extensive therapy and meds to get over the trauma of a fractured, poverty stricken childhood. 

Allow yourself the gift of hitting the reset button, and allowing yourself the opportunity of planned parenthood down the road if thatâ€™s what you end up wanting. Youâ€™re doing no one any favors by continuing this pregnancy.

It would be one thing if you were like â€œI really want this baby but finances or the Dad is threatening or I live in a car.â€ But itâ€™s abundantly clear if you had a time machine to that sexual encounter, you would have prevented the conception. All youâ€™re doing is taking a single extra step to prevent the pregnancy from going any further.

Youâ€™ll be ok. 1 in 4 women will do this in her lifetime."
