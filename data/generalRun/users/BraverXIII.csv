pathofexile,fffha35,t1_ffet7yw,1579883934.0,"It might sound crazy right now to just stop playing a character you've invested so much into, but once you've played the game a lot it becomes really exciting to start a new build in a new economy when everyone else is starting fresh with you. New leagues are great and keep the game fresh."
pathofexile,fffbksm,t3_et20ry,1579880355.0,"If I am using Cast While Channeling along with Inspiration, will the non-channeled spell receive the benefit of Inspiration's ""Supported Skills Deal x% More Elemental Damage Per Inspiration Charge"" or does that only affect the Channeling skill?

I think this is less clear than most cases like this because Inspiration does support the non-channeled spell, but you do not spend mana on the non-channeled spell."

elderscrollsonline,ff99i4l,t1_ff8fk56,1579707928.0,You'll get all the main expansion content just by purchasing Greymoor. The in-between-expansion-content and some other stuff like Thieve's Guild and Dark Brotherhood are gated behind ESO+ or direct purchase of them.

pathofexile,ff90pd3,t1_ff8vy7v,1579701882.0,"Quite the baseless extrapolation, there."
pathofexile,ff8yvz9,t1_ff8mo3z,1579700440.0,I think this is the correct answer.
nottheonion,feypa4n,t1_feyodfc,1579448575.0,"The chance of being successful at that is incredibly low. Being able to be a successful content creator is exceptional in itself. If you make it, you earned it - even if the money probably isn't proportional to the effort. Let's be honest, that's exactly how it works for small business owners and we revere them for their success."
elderscrollsonline,fedjj1i,t1_fe6lhll,1579013118.0,This is the kind of stuff I'd buy instantly. But gimme a guar skin for my bear haha.
elderscrollsonline,fedi3uw,t1_fecku7l,1579012101.0,Not what he asked :)
elderscrollsonline,fedgr35,t1_fedgi38,1579011089.0,"Ah, yeah, that's a long time :)"
elderscrollsonline,fedgehz,t1_feddxjg,1579010821.0,Sounds like you're just ruining it for yourself.
aww,fe2ship,t1_fe2nvzv,1578842392.0,"If you don't want to increase risks for your dog that's completely understandable. And I would agree that accidental pregnancies are immoral - if you don't plan on having puppies get your dog fixed. Failing to do so is irresponsible.

I can't agree that allowing a dog to be pregnant at all is immoral, however. It's natural and it creates life. Have you ever seen the face of a new puppy mother? They're so happy and proud :)"
aww,fe2mvd2,t1_fe2i66d,1578840660.0,"Borderline cruel? What even is this?

This person could be a breeder. If its inhumane to make new dogs you or other people want because there are already dogs, then its inhumane for people to have their own babies when there is overpopulation and babies available for adoption.

How does such an extreme stance become normal?"
pathofexile,fdjysa9,t3_elpq9y,1578491658.0,No not just you. This is happening to me and a friend of mine in US East. We live in different cities and have different ISPs.
pathofexile,fddow2m,t1_fddm4h4,1578319928.0,"Just an alternative opinion here, but I think aiming for 300 life per act is plenty, which would leave you at 1800 life for a6 which always works for me. This also gives you 3k plus going into endgame which I think is enough to get started on mapping."

todayilearned,fcmb6r5,t1_fclm644,1577769320.0,Yes. I was trying to add to the conversation and everyone seems to think I was attacking this poster. That was not my intent.
todayilearned,fcmb4ka,t1_fcm11qr,1577769265.0,"Of course people make mistakes? All I was saying is my body does not react to this situation in this way. I've experienced hot food and never done this. But I make mistakes all the time, of course. I guess I'm not sure why you're upset with my message."
todayilearned,fcmagls,t1_fclf4o4,1577768688.0,"Look, I don't know what to tell you. I guess based on comments there are people this happens to, but its completely alien to me. My body does not allow me to do this."
LifeProTips,fcldze5,t1_fclcz80,1577745598.0,He was literally instigating a situation that is likely to lead to a crash. So yes.
todayilearned,fcld8q5,t1_fcl52hb,1577745115.0,"It seems a bit extreme to inject lit napalm into a cheap, rectangular pie crust and call it food, but here we are."
