Showerthoughts,ffadhym,t3_es8lmh,1579732989.0,A bit confused. Is this a generation Z boomer thing. It seems like this young generation has poor coping mechanisms. Also there tends to be higher rates of depression in this generation of Zoomers as some people refer to them because they grew up with social media existing their whole life. Instant gratification and the need for reassurance with likes I believe has been linked to mental disorder in a few studies I have read in the last couple of months. Many times it's just a matter of these individuals playing the victim and being offended by nonsense. Doesn't surprise me that ice cream is linked to depression or seen that way. I still enjoy it for what it is. Kids these days are hopeless.
