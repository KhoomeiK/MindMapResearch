guitarplaying,ff9i66t,t3_escoku,1579713538.0,"So I'm in my 60s now and have been playing for over 40 years.  I almost hate to give you any feedback because we all follow our own path here but here goes.

My personal theory is that we all go through a series of fairly predictable slumps.  My player friends and I have discussed the ten year slump in some detail and have kind of arrived at the conclusion that what happens is:

You get into the instrument at a fairly young age and you have lots of time, few commitments, and progress is quick because you're learning the basics and can have a ton of fun quickly.  After about a decade or so a couple of things happen; you're a lot busier with life (work, college, family, whatever) and you're becoming stuck.  You've become a pretty good parrot in that you can copy a lot of the music you started learning but you have little to no idea about what's actually happening musically.  A lot of people peel off and simply quit at this point to be honest.  You've also probably outgrown the gear you started with.

So now if you want to keep getting better you have to change your behaviors and re-commit, which is tough.  I've found that the only way out of a slump is to play your way through, which means time playing.  I have little experience with the whole online/youtube model for learning at your age but what I generally did was I swapped my gear around if I could and started taking lessons from someone good.  Inevitably a good teacher will push you, show you things you didn't even know existed, give you feedback, and just by being there motivate you (if only through  guilt because you're paying your money and don't want to waste their time).  It also helps to find people to play with.  I ran a rock band for over 20 years and boy, in order to do that you have to be engaged or people get pissed.

So I guess the net net of what I'm saying here is that stay focused on the direction your'e heading, get some direct help (online or local lessons), and realize that you're in a pretty typical place.  And do keep going.  There were several times I really had to reassess whether it was worth all the time and money I spent on playing but at the end of the day I'm really happy that I did.  That said, most of my guitar energy goes into making the things these days, not playing them.

Good luck, hope this helps."

While some of you may have had great experiences you're talking to someone who was branded by the troop leader's kid as ""queer"" back in the 70's (I had long hair and liked music).  They beat me up at camp and the scout master told me to ""toughen up"".  I'm not gay (not that it probably matters to you), I'm now in my 60's, and the Boy Scouts was one of the shittiest experiences of my life.  To this day I hate the organization.  As far as the fascism goes, the old scout manual had you get up, salute the flag, and say the pledge of allegiance first thing in the morning.  Never mind their discrimination towards people that actually are gay. or, heaven forbid, atheists.

When you're a lefty you push the ball into the paper and also back into the cup and it forces the ink to have to flow over the top of the ball.  This means that the ball isn't lubricated by the ink and the action of the pen is compromised.  A right hander pulls the ball along the paper and the ink rolls underneath the ball.  On a fountain pen left handers just end up with a mess everywhere.  As far as guitars, I got my first electric guitar in 1978 and have been a guitar nerd ever since.

guitars,fdr4pzv,t3_emrull,1578679474.0,"Very nice.  I imagine the neck swap made it a lot better.  I have a friend who ran a music store for 40 some odd years and he had one of those on the wall for years (they call them ""birthdays"" when a guitar hangs on the wall for more than a year).  At some point he had a blue paisley Strat as well and one day he looked over at one of them and said ""you know, I order this stuff sometimes thinking it will be cool and then I have to look at it for years"". And then, eventually, somebody realizes that it is cool and away it goes.  I wish I'd bought that Strat to be honest."

worldnews,fdr3ge1,t3_emlvof,1578678961.0,"Wow, out of all the ass holes that work for Murdoch one of then has a spine.  Won't have a job much longer but at least they aren't destabilizing the planet to help their boss and his horrible kids get even richer.  Personally I think society as a whole should shun anyone that works for a Murdoch owned company.  Hell, I quit taking National Geographic when he bought it, anything he touches can't be trusted."
politics,fdr2qzc,t1_fdqz04a,1578678755.0,"I really disagree with what you wrote.  I see this as the direct result of Reaganism and it's been a nearly linear descent into the craziness that is now the modern republican party.  Reagan was really the first to openly mock liberals and progressives as crazy or pathetic while at the same time violating the law by selling weapons to our enemies and using the funds to finance death squads in Nicaragua.  And that was after making a behind the scenes deal with Iran to hold our hostages until after the election thereby literally committing treason.  Bush I continued with the lawlessness and eventually pardoned all those who were involved in the Iran Contra scandal before they could testify.  Gingrich published the GoPac memo which further escalated the divide by teaching republicans to use words like ""sick, treasonous, perverted, criminal"" to describe democrats.  GW Bush described anyone opposed to his wars as ""aiding and abetting the enemy"" or more famously ""if you're not with us you're against us"".  At the same time every republican administration has vehemently denied climate change and refused to even discuss measures to combat it.  When you combine all this with the poisonous stew that is FOX and Limbaugh you get exactly where we are now, a hostile, factually challenged, morally bankrupt and broken party that views the law merely as a weapon to be used against their worst enemy, which is actually the majority of the United States."
business,fdr19ix,t3_emnynb,1578678123.0,"There was a great article about the ""monetization of Boeing"" linked out of Reddit a couple of weeks ago.  Yep, it's the MBA types that came in to maximize profit and their bonuses while turning engineering into a commodity service and offshoring as much as they could. It's the same type of corporate culture that lead to the Volkswagen emissions scandal and the near destruction of HP."
