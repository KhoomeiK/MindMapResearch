Unlike a ginger, auburn hair is very much a light shade of brown that leans toward red to the human eye. This coloring is quite common in Europe and the UK, but isn't really noticed that often in the United States even though it is fairly common here too. Both colors are often lumped together as ""redhead"", but the difference is noted.

Conversely, Misato's ""purple"" hair is a common motif in anime to show a shiny black that is utterly lacking in the brownish qualities that most people have. Perhaps this is a similar beauty standard about hair along the lines of why Chinese hair is considered the ""best"" for wigs in Japan, and this being not unrelated to their lingering affinity for Chinese styles of past eras."

I keep coming back to how James VI became James I because of empty throne that he claimed on behalf of his own country's lenders... which has since given rise to paranoid questions about nation-states foreclosing on each others' sovereign debts. The other thing I keep recalling is the Interregnum, wherein Parliament dethroned his son, Charles I -- reasons being another debate entirely.

Flash forward to the American Revolution and the American Civil War, which really only had British malfeasance as a common factor, the question was never really over whether or not anybody had the right to leave -- in the former, they took when they didn't have it, and in the latter they abused it when they did. It's something that ever since the two World Wars officially ""did not happen"", but the British were meddling in the American South in the lead up to the Civil War in an eerily similar way to how the Russians have been meddling both here and in Europe in order to break up any rival unions."
