unpopularopinion,ffiyd83,t3_etr0sb,1579985748.0,"No. Just no. I respect you expressing you opinion, but I don’t like your opinion. Is it unpopular? Maybe. I sure hope it is unpopular. There’s lots of dumb humans around. Do they deserve to go extinct?"
socialanxiety,ffisyph,t3_et7du9,1579981939.0,That’s a very interesting concept!!! I’ll try giving it a go.
socialanxiety,ffiswzr,t3_et83ft,1579981905.0,"Sometimes when I meet new people in a large scale social setting, people will introduce themselves to me but my brain is in panic mode so I won’t even process what they’ve said at all."
socialanxiety,ffiso34,t1_fffeoy2,1579981726.0,That really hit hard.
socialanxiety,ffisda8,t3_etexfg,1579981510.0,"Hmm. That’s tricky. If I were you, first of all, I’d try casually asking him about his dating life, his past experiences or relationships, to get an idea of whether or not he’s actually straight. If you haven’t already done that. Also, I don’t know if you would feel comfortable enough to do that, but maybe sharing with him that you’re gay and seeing how he’ll react? Either way, good luck. And I hope it goes well for you."
socialanxiety,ffis0rf,t3_etfbq0,1579981260.0,"There’s so many things. For me personally, I wanna cover the basics first. Get a boyfriend. Find a group of people that I feel like I belong with. Go to places together. Road trips."
socialanxiety,ffirs83,t3_etig68,1579981091.0,"Also, how about Dale Carnegie’s books? How To Win Friends And Influence People. You can try that."
socialanxiety,ffirmfb,t3_etig68,1579980976.0,"I feel like the best way of building social skills is genuinely just getting yourself out there and talking to people. It will take a while, but that’s fine. The ones who matter don’t mind, and the ones who mind don’t matter."
socialanxiety,ffireh3,t3_etjp99,1579980820.0,"I used to be really scared of buying alcohol before. And I’ve gotten a couple of weird looks from cashiers before like when I bought vodka once. But mostly I’ve realized they truly don’t care and even if they do judge you in the moment, they will either forget about it very soon because they see so many people pass by, or you’ll forget, because you’ll have won the battle against your anxiety, and as a reward, you have alcohol. To drink your sorrows away. Because you’ve won a battle. But the war is still going on."
socialanxiety,ffir3ap,t3_etlp1j,1579980600.0,"You sound like a nice guy who would be nice to talk to. Anxiety is hard to overcome regardless of whether you have autism or not, but it’s not impossible. Don’t lose hope. I think you might have a lot of stuff in your life going on for you that you’re not giving yourself enough credit for.

You’re 29. You’ve got your life ahead of you. Keep working at it. Do things you enjoy, and surround yourself with people whose presence you enjoy. Sometimes, when the right people come along, it gets easier."
socialanxiety,ffiqhvy,t1_ffipzie,1579980186.0,"Are you feeling better now? That’s good to hear. 

It’s weird because my social anxiety is constantly trying to tell me to do my best to not stand out in any way, not draw any attention to myself, not express any of my feelings and opinions. It feels so lonely and isolating, and I end up feeling like a shell of a man. Kind of nothing, yeah. Sometimes I feel like I can only be myself.... when I’m by myself."
socialanxiety,ffiq5de,t3_eto65b,1579979944.0,"i feel you 100%. i’m suffering at my current job rn. nothing i’ve tried to combat this with has helped so far. but don’t give up. keep trying stuff. therapy, self help books, exercise, making tiny steps each day by talking to people and getting out of your comfort zone. some days or weeks you won’t feel like you’ve made any progress at all but keep going. it’s a hard task so don’t give yourself such a hard time. how about spending more time doing things you enjoy? distracting myself with fun activities or hobbies or attempting to keep myself busy is one of the few things that helps for me personally. give yourself something to look forward to. like, yeah, socializing sucks and today is gonna be a really freaking long and hard day, but i’m gonna reward myself afterwards."
socialanxiety,ffipldr,t3_etqz9n,1579979553.0,"i have been going on and off to this therapist and i felt exactly the same way. uncomfortable, don’t know what to say, feel silly whenever i do say something. but just because you had a bad experience with one therapist you didn’t click with, doesn’t mean you should completely give up on therapy as a whole. maybe you will be able to find a therapist that makes you feel more at ease. and how about going to a psychiatrist or a doctor, maybe medication will help?"
socialanxiety,ffip5cu,t1_ffi9n68,1579979239.0,"have you given betterhelp a try? my experience with going to a therapist wasn’t very successful, so i was wondering if an alternative like that might be a more feasible option. but also it’s pretty expensive."
socialanxiety,ffiovyh,t3_etruy8,1579979061.0,I wish I knew the answer to that. Sometimes it feel like my personality has merged with the social anxiety.
socialanxiety,femib4f,t3_epqfuc,1579257024.0,"There’s plenty of helpful posts, for support or advice. I personally find the memes somewhat uplifting. I like laughing at my misery."
socialanxiety,femi9vj,t3_epqjlx,1579256973.0,"Yep. Always the Quiet One. Being called that fucks with your brain. I can’t talk at all after that. I get branded as quiet, and I brand myself as quiet, and now I can barely speak at all at the office unless I’m spoken to."
socialanxiety,femi7sx,t3_epqyup,1579256889.0,"Aye, humans do suck. I agree. So you find yourself not wanting to spend time around people at all? Like, is it because you feel anxious, or just generally? If the anxiety wasn’t there, would you wanna spend time with them? Or maybe you need to surround yourself with some new people. People sometimes grow apart from each other, and that’s natural."
socialanxiety,femi1gk,t3_epu3bl,1579256625.0,"I don’t know. Try to not think about it too much. Smile to people, and greet them, and then do your work. If a conversation happens naturally, so be it."
socialanxiety,femhtq2,t3_epwucs,1579256301.0,"I wanted to do that too. An additional problem for me is that not many artists of the ones I care about actually come to my country. So if I wanted to go to a concert, I would have to go alone in a foreign country. Which seems somewhat scary and I don’t know if I’m brave enough for it. And I just don’t have friends I could ask to come with me."
socialanxiety,femhqk4,t3_epy469,1579256165.0,"I understand that feeling! You know, when you go long periods of time without having a proper conversation with anyone, it kinda fucks with your head. And for me, even the simplest shortest normal conversation that goes somewhat well can snap me out of that. This also happens surprisingly rarely for me."
socialanxiety,femhmmw,t1_feikwnj,1579256003.0,"Good luck to you, friend. I hope we both manage to figure it out one day."
socialanxiety,femhl2z,t1_fegumpm,1579255937.0,"I tried seeking help. I’ve been going to therapy but it makes me feel awkward and I shut down and unable to talk about what’s bothering me because I feel like all my worries are stupid. It’s always the same kind of scenario all over again of me being anxious over a social situation and I feel like my therapist is tired of that too. And when I shared it with my doctor, they said it must not be that bad if I shared it with them, and gave me some passionflower extract thing. I feel so stupid but work is so hard for me to get through every day, everything just feels like hell, it just isn’t living."
socialskills,femdd33,t1_fekbkm9,1579249722.0,"I see what you mean. But then, where do you draw the line between understanding and accepting your anxiety, and giving into it?  Because I understand why I feel anxious, but I still can’t help but beat myself up over it, and telling myself that I need to be better."
depression,femd8t5,t1_fekh637,1579249556.0,"I think the “wake up early, see the sun, do some cardio” method would do good to everyone as long as they manage to pull it off and turn it into a habit. Whenever I put in the time and effort to work out, I feel immensely better, even if it’s just for 20 minutes, and yet I still get too lazy to do anything on most days."
socialanxiety,femd336,t1_felofmx,1579249339.0,"Good luck to you! Yeah, there are lots of resources, and this subreddit is very helpful too. But creating new habits is such a hard thing, once you’ve gotten used to behaving in a certain way. CBT workbooks, therapy, I like the idea of those things, but therapy hasn’t particularly helped me, and I find it hard to find time to work on CBT stuff on my own, even though I found some great books (still haven’t gotten around to reading more than a couple of chapters of Feeling Good by David Burns)."
r4r,fektyjs,t3_epoft1,1579207546.0,so you’re not literally dying...
depression,fektn5j,t3_epmwv5,1579207359.0," Keep going, and trust that life has something in store for you. You sound like a nice enough guy."
shadowhunters,fekibxz,t1_fejtuq9,1579200643.0,NOOO THAT’S SO SAD. SO HE HAD IT EVEN WORSE IN THE BOOKS. That’s not even close to a happy ending. My poor boy.
depression,fejj2ok,t3_ephq3m,1579176401.0,"No, it’s not an excuse. Not wanting to do anything isn’t a pleasant place to be at, it sucks, and it’s hard to get through, so I’m sorry that you’re feeling this way."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fejhr17,t3_epfp77,1579174803.0,"Oh, you mean The Philosopher’s Stone?"
depression,fejh3tc,t3_ephb69,1579173961.0,"Honestly, it doesn’t matter. Because if you’re feeling depressed, unless you go out and try to distract yourself by keeping yourself busy with other stuff, it’s gonna be really hard for you to snap out of it. I’m obviously not an expert and I’m still struggling myself too, but I know from experience that the more I close myself off and do nothing, the worse I feel. So try taking smaller steps towards being more active and outgoing.

Also, it’s really cheesy and overused as an advice, but exercising genuinely helps. It’s hard to stick to it and incorporate it as a part of a routine, but it’s worth giving it a try."
socialskills,fejgosl,t1_fej59bb,1579173402.0,"That was very nice of you to say, thank you. Best of luck to you too!"
lonely,fejgmgp,t3_epghwg,1579173311.0,"I get what you’re saying, but just because there’s a bunch of horny guys on Tinder that we get to choose from in case we get super desperate, doesn’t mean “loneliness is harder to evade”. I mean I get what you’re saying, but then, I don’t think this is how things work. It’s a lot more complicated."
shadowhunters,fejebne,t1_fehtyqa,1579169918.0,Yeah! He seemed happy but. I think he could have been ever happier and I think he deserved more recognition. I don’t know.
shadowhunters,fejeadj,t1_fehti2c,1579169866.0,"I’ve only read one of the books, and a long time ago, so I don’t know what happened there. Did something different take place in the books?

I will say, David Castro is pretty darn charming, so maybe that has influenced my opinion of Raphael too a little bit...."
Scrubs,fejaxha,t3_epcf1s,1579164805.0,I’d pick J.D or Dr. Cox. Don’t know about Turk. Maybe if I needed a surgical opinion but otherwise nah.
socialskills,fej3ajd,t1_feirfzk,1579155291.0,"That’s true, not caring at all isn’t a good thing either. But then, when I’m around people who I respect a lot and appreciate, I often feel more anxious than ever, because I want to impress that person, and I really really don’t want to disappoint them. And in my effort to do that, my anxiety goes out of control and I’m unable to act the way I intended.

That being said, I’ve met a couple of individuals in my life that are so inspiring, so completely opposite of me, and the epitome of everything I want to be in a way that- you feel accepted by them, because you can tell that they don’t really care about you being more anxious or whatever it is that you are insecure about."
depression,feizeli,t1_feir2zv,1579151572.0,"Watching very sad movies sometimes works for me. I know it sounds stupid but something like Titanic or Atonement almost always makes me cry.
Or maybe try writing your feelings down on paper, if you haven’t done that already. I rarely remember to do that, but when I do, it feels a lot better, and it makes you more aware of what you’re feeling, so perhaps it’ll have a similar therapeutic effect. 
Hm. Or talking things out with someone, being completely honest with them? If you don’t have a friend you would feel comfortable doing that with, maybe a therapist. Either way. Good luck, man."

You get to choose the people you want to surround yourself with, you get to choose the goals you work towards, you get to choose what to do in the sometimes limited spare time you have.

And what Iâ€™ve learned in the time Iâ€™ve had a job is that, ever since Iâ€™ve been spending my 9 to 5 in an office, I appreciate my spare time so much more than I have before. Itâ€™s hard, but it feels nice to know youâ€™ve done something productive, youâ€™ve earned the money youâ€™ve been given. It ainâ€™t all that bad. Life is unfair, sure, but try not to think about it.

Itâ€™s an office job and itâ€™s terrible but Iâ€™m hoping that when I find something else, something that I enjoy more too, Iâ€™ll stumble upon people who are less intimidating, loud, talkative and judgemental, and people whose presence makes me more comfortable.

socialanxiety,fdmv1v4,t1_fdlzkit,1578567150.0,"Thatâ€™s what I thought. An entry level office job, that sounds simple enough. No. Itâ€™s hell. Being surrounded by people all day. Who are always expecting you to have some kind of small talk with them. And have lunch with them. And then talk more."

The fact that everyone there is super loud, and that my boss barely has any time to give me any feedback on my work doesnâ€™t help (the only feedback he has given me is to work on my communication skills).

So yeah. Iâ€™m losing my sanity and fighting what seems to be a hopeless battle."
socialanxiety,fcu0ej4,t1_fctqfvf,1577968167.0,Thank you for your comment! Iâ€™ve been at my office for around 5 months now. It does not seem to be getting any easier. Itâ€™s getting increasingly frustrating and Iâ€™ve never been more unhappy to be a quiet person.
socialanxiety,fbxi0o7,t3_eez1q9,1577188473.0,"Honestly, sometimes I genuinely feel thankful to people who keep inviting me to things. Because Iâ€™m super awkward and shy, and Iâ€™m always too afraid that when people find out what Iâ€™m really like, theyâ€™ll lose interest at all and stop wanting to go out with me at all. Which happens sometimes. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m thankful when someone is persistent and actually wants to spend time with me. Unless theyâ€™re an asshole or something."
