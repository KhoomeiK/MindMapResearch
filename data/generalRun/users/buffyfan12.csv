i quit buying food for myself and bringing it into the house because I worked 2nd shift and anything I bought was “communal.” And if I put it in the fridge it would be gone by the time I got up for work, or came home from work. But I still bought her few things from the store she ran out of or needed (you ran out of a 6lb pot roast?)

as I was moving out me and his now ex wife got into an argument about how I had lived there for free, and I was like...I spent $600 a month or more on food, school supplies, pet food and I had kicked in $250 for one of my nephews 16th birthday party which...I was at work for. I gave you $100 a month directly for internet and cable (which I never watched Tv but used the internet,)

I think I only bothered with her 5 times after that after I moved out.

almost forgot-2 months after I moved out she texted me a grocery shopping list, I was like what. She said she needed some stuff and since I had lived there so long I owed her more in food,  now mind you my brother made $160k a year...and I called her and was like...no that’s not happening anymore."

2-buy low carb options like nuts, cheese, jerky, pork rinds, 

3-have plenty of safe snacks on hand..... 

4-there is low carb bread...it’s expensive as frak though.  You can also buy low carb wraps (literally cheese) or keep Romaine on hand to throw your sandwich toppings on cut up romaine to make salad.

5- full fat yogurt and dairy is far more satiating then low fat,"

diabetes,fdp6k2i,t3_emjri8,1578621179.0,"controlled research with CGMS have shown that even other wise normal, healthy, non diabetic people can show extremely high blood glucose-well over 150 close to and possibly exceeding 200 for some within 60 minutes post a meal. (and not even I ate a pound of sugar....I mean a bowl of typical breakfast cereal, pancakes with syrup, eggs and oatmeal with orange juice. )

by 120 minutes most normals have dived down to near 150 or below and at 3 hours they are at a normal blood sugar.

as someone becomes diabetics that 60 minutes high becomes higher and stays high for longer.

1-diet

3- medication.

by different applications of different aspects of the 3, you. can overcome a shortcoming in another aspect of the 3.

In addition since there are very few Trans protections codified in State and Federal regulations...unlike being diabetic...I think it’s safe to say: “You know not what you speak.”

In addition I wasn’t talking about death, I was talking about police interaction, and how a simple police interaction can lead to escalation up to and including death for gays/lesbians, minorities, and transgendered.

I also brought up how the interaction didn’t escalate because of criminal history, actual “innocent” criminal behavior (like pot possession) or...and my personal favorite perceived belligerence by the police officers.

I’m sorry I didn’t give you the succor you wanted, I even said I’m sympathetic just you are going to encounter far worse in your life.

It happened to you and people in public suck, you will have more encounters/issues/incidents throughout your life. 

You weren’t tazed, handcuffed or otherwise publicly humiliated. You or your partner weren’t so annoyed that the cop thought you were being belligerent and responded in escalation. 

You weren’t treating a low or a high causing behavior that would have scared a cop into pulling a weapon on you.

Heck, you didn’t even have a “well meaning yet ignorant” person in public confront you...which always escalated things like this. 

As I said I’m sympathetic.

Now take a look at what happened and see how far worse it could have gone."
