houston,fedl7a6,t3_enqhuj,1579014274.0,"My experience has been that during the first quarter of that drive, you make good time - like really, really good time. After hearing about how bad traffic would be, it's almost too good to be true. But you enjoy it and convince yourself that this drive will be different than all those other drives and you start thinking about what you are going to do with the extra time you will have - maybe even throw a party. Even at the start of the second quarter of the drive, it is still going great, not quite as great as the first quarter, but still really good - you are way, way ahead of schedule.

Then you notice traffic pick up a little bit, so you start to get worried. Maybe you just need to drive a little faster, take a little bit more risk and you will still get home early. You take an exit thinking you can get right back on with no problem. But you can't. You're stuck. In traffic. Lots of traffic. Four times more traffic than you ever thought you would see after the beginning of the drive.

By the time you are halfway home, you realize this drive is going to be lot longer than you thought. Even a lot longer than all of the other drives. The longest drive since you went to upstate New York when you were a kid."
