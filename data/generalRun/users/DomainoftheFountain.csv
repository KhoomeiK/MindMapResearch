vegan,ffbhx83,t1_ffbgdtc,1579766088.0,"In the original post the title quote is from though they weren’t actually buying less animal products though. The order had extra bacon, egg, and cheese added, more animal products than a basic hamburger. It would be like praising someone for buying a leather coat instead of fur.

And taking the vegan 30 day champagne would require you to actually eat plant based for those 30 days."

vegan,ffbg752,t3_esoppq,1579763878.0,There’s a difference with not letting the perfect be the enigma of the good and  praising people still buying animal products.

PropagandaPosters,ffavg4t,t1_ffa2048,1579745415.0,"Historically, not particularly."
vegan,ff5hc3j,t1_ff2jrzt,1579592893.0,Dried fruit like dates and apricots are good snacks. High cal and you can eat plenty of them.
vegancirclejerk,ff4vceh,t1_ff4hwi0,1579573324.0,Who said he was doing it for praise? And the more people in the public spotlight doing it will make it more normalised for the average person.
fatlogic,ff2ewfe,t1_ff2cbmz,1579503263.0,I think you’re confusing bmr with tdee. You’ll lose waight eating above your bmr if it’s still below your tdee.
fatlogic,ff2etc1,t1_ff2ca8l,1579503168.0,Not him but my tdee is around 3500. I’m 6’ at 167lb. I lift 6 days a week followed by 30min of cardio. On my rest days I normally go on a half marathon run.
fatlogic,ff2enqd,t1_ff2am8u,1579502996.0,Maybe you’re normal sedentary woman. I’m a 6’ man at 167lb and my BMR is around 1800.

So?"
australia,fep5ugz,t1_fejn4hk,1579312800.0,Have you tried the plant based alternatives?
melbourne,fep48ru,t1_femc6ii,1579311785.0,I’d say killing animals just because you like how they taste is wrong.
vegan,fembwu9,t3_epx97n,1579247791.0,"Get some veggies in, especially green leafy ones like kale and spinach. Hmm maybe mix some of them, fortified plant milk, and some vegan protein powder in a smoothie?"
vegan,fembsl8,t3_epto0c,1579247641.0,"There are apps available on phones that can scan the product and ingredients to see if something is vegan. For example here in Australia I have an app called fussy vegan scanner. I presume switching from vegetarian to vegan wouldn’t be that hard, replace dairy with plant based alternatives, tofu for egg scramble, chickpeas for egg sandwiches. As for supplements all that is 100% required is B12."

worldnews,fem9oxb,t1_fem75ee,1579244994.0,"Trillion day upon day is an overstatement but most estimates iirc put a trillion+ yearly from commercial fishing. There’s a reason it’s reported in tones not fish numbers, it’s just to impractical to count the amount we are pulling out of the ocean."
vegan,fem79ws,t1_fek0jsu,1579242295.0,A price on carbon and other externalities would definitely make animal agriculture unprofitable.
vegan,fem74s9,t1_felkk6n,1579242146.0,Just because an economy has currency doesn‘t mean it’s capitalist. If you’re going to critique an economic system you should at least have a basic understanding of it first.
vegan,fem6yuz,t1_fekrz2o,1579241973.0,"Because the USSR had no factory farms? Factory farms are due to the the increased demand from population and wealth growth, and technological development."
vegancirclejerk,fem4qiw,t1_fel0p75,1579239705.0,Well with regular handjobs I would have become vegan much sooner.
vegancirclejerk,fem3ng3,t3_epu7k0,1579238671.0,Well very dark chocolate isn’t too bad...
