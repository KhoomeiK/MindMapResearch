puppy101,ff9e38b,t1_ff9de2b,1579711018.0,"That definitely makes it harder! As well as shrinking it with a divider, taking out the bedding for now might help since they often want to poop on soft things, especially if they've ever been encouraged to go on pee pads. 

We had to leave the crate bare for the first few days since ours would pee on any bedding almost immediately, but after getting further with potty training we were able to put blankets in again before long."
puppy101,ff9chby,t3_es9wp5,1579709870.0,"At that age it's best if she's always crated or confined to a very small area that she uses as a sleeping/eating area whenever you can't directly supervise. If you aren't using a crate, I would make sure you only leave the room immediately after taking her outside, and only very briefly. She should also be given the chance to go potty outside very frequently for now (I aimed to go out after 20-30 min of inside time at that age, or after 1-2 hours if crated). 

Make sure you're training her to be calm when you're out of the room - the wiki section linked by the bot will walk you through this process. It's a slow process (weeks) - you'll need to gradually work your way up to longer times alone."
puppy101,ff6f0db,t3_erwo08,1579625763.0,"I work from home sometimes. I keep the schedule very similar to when I'm not at home - from \~4 months old until recently she was crated all morning and afternoon with a lunchtime break. In the last month we've been testing out leaving her in the main part of the house instead (stairs blocked off) while I work upstairs. I check in occasionally with the wifi camera and she's been pretty good so far, just sleeps the whole time. 

Even now there's absolutely no way I'd get work done with her in the same room. She can chill for a while but is clearly bored rather than sleeping, and can't manage it for 4 hours straight. And when she was younger it was completely impossible, she'd just be constantly chewing on everything. Maybe when she's more of an adult we'll try again."
puppy101,ff66v4a,t3_ernep2,1579620545.0,"The risk at puppy classes is quite small since the training centre should require proof of being vaccinated appropriately for their age (if they don't ask you for this, I would not go there). It's not zero since the puppies won't have full immunity yet, but it's low enough that the huge socialization benefits of puppy classes significantly outweigh the risks for most people. If you want to be extra safe you could go for a class that starts at 10+ weeks so all the puppies will be around their second round of shots and you're less likely to run into irresponsibly bred puppies who were sold already infected with parvo/distemper (since those are usually sold very young).

You could lock your pup in your room his whole life and he'd be perfectly ""safe"" but safety isn't everything in life."
puppy101,ff4s8wd,t1_ff4q1ia,1579571203.0,"That's great! Sounds like she knows her stuff. 

We went to 2 different local training facilities - I could tell you the names but it wouldn't mean anything unless you happen to live in my city. One of the places offered extra playdate sessions for 10$ for all their current students so we went to a handful of those (we were lucky that they were different dogs each time). A lot of dog trainers in my city offer single playdate sessions like that but often only for their own puppy class students.

Adult dogs are great too as long as they're known to be good with other dogs (and not known to be cranky with puppies). They probably won't want to play as much unless they're young, but that's a very valuable lesson for your pup to learn too. Just make sure you give him a short break whenever he doesn't listen to the adult telling him to back off."
puppy101,ff4eqzw,t3_erl2hx,1579561864.0,"This is an excellent reason to skip the dog park until minimum 6 months old (some dog parks even have this as a rule). In addition, your dog should have decent social skills and confidence before going, both to reduce the chance of provoking another dog and so he's more mentally resilient if a negative interaction does occur.

Some people prefer to avoid the dog park even for adult dogs and that's perfectly legitimate too. There are unavoidable risks and for some people the cost:benefit ratio isn't worth it. For others it is, so it's a personal preference thing."
puppy101,ff47xkl,t3_erk7ea,1579557491.0,"An adolescent dog might get mouthy at times when overstimulated but this sounds more like he's learned that biting is the way to get what he wants (mostly not being picked up). I would stop picking him up entirely - if you need him to go somewhere, you can use commands, lure with treats, or if all else fails, use gentle leash pressure. If he doesn't want to cuddle you should be respecting that after paying attention to his earlier cues, before he feels the need to bite. Dogs learn to bite when their more mild ""back off"" signals are ignored, and this is not a road you want to go down. 

Since this is a learned behaviour for him now, you may need to consult with a positive-reinforcement based trainer or a vet behaviourist for help. They'll be able to see in person if there's something you can do differently or (in the case of a vet behaviourist) if your dog may have a medical issue causing the behaviour."

puppy101,ff3zlsj,t3_eriqtz,1579552320.0,"I like this question! Honestly we did a less-than-ideal job at socializing so probably a lot of things, though we haven't had too many clearly preventable socialization issues yet. 

We're currently getting a lot of freakouts at winter-related things that wouldn't have been possible to expose her to anyway (though maybe she'd be more calm about them if we'd socialized with a wider variety of things early on). 

The super-scary winter freakout list includes but is not limited to: christmas inflatables in front yards, people shovelling snow, kids being pulled on sleds, people cross-country skiing, kids playing hockey in a neighbourhood rink, a kid making a snow angel, a kid building a snow fort....sigh. Can't wait to see what's next.

We are working through these slowly as they pop up and nothing seems to be a lasting issue yet, though it's often embarrassing now that she's a big dog with a loud bark!"
puppy101,ff3uxxx,t3_erfa16,1579549405.0,"You are seeing that scolding him and rubbing his nose in it isn't working (besides being cruel and teaching him that you're a scary person), so stop that right now. 

Most potty training issues can be solved by taking them out on a very frequent schedule (like, every 30 minutes at first) and either crating or keeping him in a small blocked-off area and very closely supervising at all times when inside. If you catch him in the act, you can try to interrupt (clap your hands, pick him up, etc) but don't scold, just carry or lead him directly outside. If you don't catch him in the act, your learning chance is gone so just clean it up and ignore him. Also, make sure you're cleaning every accident very thoroughly with an enzyme cleaner. 

Don't restrict his water. Not only is it potentially dangerous, peeing a lot is actually what you want because it gives you more chances to teach him where to go. 

When he goes outside, make a huge deal of it, praise him like he just saved your life, give him a piece of hotdog or three, etc. Make him REALLY want to repeat it, and he will try his best. It's going to be harder than usual since he's gotten in the habit of going inside now, but he can still learn."
puppy101,ff3rro9,t3_erhh6k,1579547444.0,"Try to go to more puppy classes/play dates at different places and with different puppies. He sounds quite timid and this is usually a sign that more socialization is needed (preferably through organized and closely supervised sessions). We did 2 rounds of puppy classes plus a few extra playdates because our puppy was on the timid side too. She's great now though. 

It's not clear whether the puppy trainer intervened at all - they should be interrupting play frequently when one puppy is not enjoying it or when they get too overexcited. A more fearful puppy will need close management to make sure he/she isn't getting too scared, and the trainer should be on top of this. 

If the supervisor just watched all the puppies duke it out for the whole session (petsmart is a bit notorious for this), I'd definitely go somewhere else for puppy classes/playdates. Many dog training facilities offer puppy classes."
puppy101,ff3p5il,t1_ff3oh7q,1579545847.0,"It's great that you're starting classes. I want to emphasize not to use the muzzle there (or anywhere at this age, honestly). It's absolutely vital that she DOES bite both you and other dogs (= puppies and calm adult dogs that won't over-correct her) at this early age to learn how hard is too hard to bite (bite inhibition). It hurts and it sucks and it's completely necessary so you don't have an adult dog biting you for real."
puppy101,ff3hfc8,t3_erg2bk,1579541098.0,"In this scenario I would ask (tell) the other owner to please recall or grab their dog while I try to body block to separate them. Throwing treats to distract is also a great idea, especially if the other owner is a jerk or not around.

Picking up your dog is not usually recommended since it can greatly excite the other dog and cause it to jump on you and bite you and/or your dog. I'd only do it if the other dog was already aggressively attacking your dog.

>The dog was very forceful, teeth bared and pushed her to the floor whenever she tried to get up.

Please note, this is not ""over-friendly"" behaviour. It's bullying and the other owner should be interrupting it to teach their dog that it's not ok."
dogs,ff3duk6,t3_erdezp,1579539100.0,"Since he's doubled in size in the past month, he may be under 6 months. It's hard even for a vet to guess age - if it's based on teeth for example, some dogs finish teething early (mine had all her adult teeth fully in by 5 months). You'll be able to get a better sense of his adult size when he stops growing so fast. 

I would not worry about him doing outdoor activities with you regardless of size/breed. Surprisingly small dogs can go on very tough hikes, runs etc - just make sure they're done growing first."
puppy101,ff3apcz,t3_erexkc,1579537523.0,"No more dog park, full stop. It is further traumatizing your already terrified puppy. 

This is unusually fearful behaviour for a 5 month old. How have you socialized him so far? You need to work on this asap in a way that doesn't overwhelm him. You need to stop people and dogs from approaching immediately when he shows any signs of fear (read up on signs of stress - you need to intervene WAY before he actually snaps). Interactions should never be forced or even lured with treats. In fact I would avoid interactions entirely for now. A ""do not pet"" vest can be helpful for this. 

You'll need to work on counter conditioning by giving him treats around people and other dogs from VERY far away, and not letting them get close enough to scare him. Gradually you can get closer but only when he's not scared.

He's on the old side for puppy classes but if you can find one that accepts puppies his age, I would suggest asking the trainer in advance if/how they can accommodate a puppy with this level of fear. Be very careful - a poorly run puppy class that is ""wild west"" style can do more harm than good. You need a trainer that will control the sessions enough that your puppy will have only good experiences with other dogs. You may need one on one help from a trainer instead or in addition to classes."
puppy101,ff38yyp,t3_erezk0,1579536502.0,"Ask your vet if they would consider giving you a sedative and what they suggest for walks (as well as other activities like stairs and playing with the other dog - I've heard very different recommendations here from different vets).

Besides that, do a search for ""canine enrichment activities"" (the wiki here is a great start), consider buying or making some new puzzle toys, and remember that it's temporary and you'll both get through it soon. Good luck to her!"
puppy101,ff37til,t3_erdqjf,1579535739.0,"Normal yes, but also something that needs to be worked on. Since early adolescence we've occasionally had entire walks like this (mostly in new/exciting places) and frequently have overstimulated moments on otherwise-calm walks. It usually happens after one or more triggers that I can identify (for us it's often darkness, snow, wind and other dogs, especially reactive ones).

Try to identify what his triggers are and avoid going too close to the triggers/places he tends to react, especially if he's already having a hard time focusing that day. Work on focus training and basic commands indoors and practice them over and over outdoors in areas with gradually more distractions. For triggers like dogs and squirrels, counter conditioning and the engage/disengage game are helpful. 

An obedience class would probably also be helpful since this is a very common problem in young excitable dogs. Even better if you can find one aimed at adolescent dogs."
puppy101,ff35uuz,t1_ff355qr,1579534402.0,"Yeah I totally get it, mine is like that too (as a young puppy she would run so hard she'd crash into walls repeatedly and her newest favourite thing is jumping over the back of the couch to ambush whoever's sitting there). Just do your best to limit the higher impact stuff and most likely he'll be fine. And if not, you can deal with it then. Nobody's perfect and you can't protect him from everything - all we can do is try our best.

EDIT: I should mention capturing calmness and teaching a settle here, which have both dramatically reduced the indoors craziness level for us. Enrichment activities like puzzle toys have also helped a lot. Highly recommend all of that!"
puppy101,ff31n1b,t3_erc8av,1579531299.0,"That rule is generally for formal walks, though he may need enforced breaks from playing too if he doesn't take breaks on his own. I'd try not to deliberately encourage running on hard surfaces with fetch and chasing games at all - whenever possible, try to do those activities on carpet or outside on softer surfaces instead. If that's not possible I would keep the sessions very short. Try not to let him jump off the couch etc either, though I know that's much easier said than done... 

If you aren't already, start practicing your walks on leash inside now so he can get used to it."
puppy101,ff2ur6z,t3_ercohu,1579524955.0,"Yes, you'll want to do some counter conditioning like you describe - make sure you're under threshold (far enough away) so he's not showing signs of stress.

More importantly, he absolutely needs to be on leash anytime he's near a cycling route (at minimum you need to be 110% confident he won't break a heel, but that describes many people whose dogs did in fact bolt and were hit by cars etc). Allowing him to bolt in front of cyclists is very dangerous - a cyclist at a good speed could kill or very badly hurt him, and you could also seriously injure the cyclist.  You were lucky this time."
dogs,fetpzbu,t1_fetgxyk,1579378202.0,"Yep. Also, our vet sold us single doses of the monthly preventative so we could treat at the correct dose as our puppy grew. You don't necessarily have to buy a full box."

Aside from this whole mess, having purebred puppies in the first place is a yellow-to-red flag for a rescue - typically you'll only see adult purebreds in rescue since a purebred litter is almost certainly intentional. It can happen in rare cases (accidental litters, owner-surrendered due to parvo, or puppy mill seizures) but if the rescue routinely has purebred puppies it's very likely that they are not a reputable rescue.

Unfortunately, this will likely change soon as he gets a stronger jaw and gets further into teething. Normal if so, if not count yourself lucky. My arms were covered in scabs and bruises for weeks. Yes, it hurts. That's what it's like having a large breed puppy.

Go through all the bite inhibition info in the automod link and be patient. Training bite inhibition often takes many weeks even if you're doing everything 100% correctly, and shepherds are notoriously bitey puppies.

Keep in mind that yelping is counterproductive for many puppies (like mine) who see it as a play signal rather than realizing you're in pain. Immediately withdrawing all attention, turning around and walking away (preferably over a baby gate) for about 30 seconds is often far more effective."

If your vet recommended the K9 advantix I would either stick with that (along with a heartworm med if that's a concern in your area) or ask your vet about trying something like nexgard spectra which includes heartworm protection."
puppy101,fek25bc,t3_epkwh8,1579190998.0,"I've had similar issues with my very excitable and food-motivated dog. One video I watched on this suggested not giving the treat if she looks at you at all when you approach. We didn't end up sticking with this because it literally happened 100% of the time after many many repeats and we were both getting frustrated, but you could try it and see if it works for you. Or try a more moderate version and only give the treat if she doesn't get overly excited when you approach.

We also have to give the treats in a very calm and controlled fashion - no dropping or throwing, place it slowly on the ground between her front legs. We also had to use lower value treats (kibbles) to reduce excitement level. And no clicking or other signs that food is coming, just walk over calmly and place a treat in front of her at random times whenever she's doing the desired behaviour.

My dog will now lie down most the time we aren't directly interacting with her and very pointedly stare at us like ""I'm being good, now where are my treats, humans?"", which perhaps isn't ideally ""calm"" but I'll take it."

You'll probably want to add a long-line leash to your list (\~10-20 feet, NOT a retractable) for non-structured exploring but this isn't urgent since you probably won't be taking him out wandering until he's had more of his vaccines anyway. 

Be prepared to have hardly any free time to do things like cooking and grocery shopping/errands so the more of that you can do in advance the better. Grocery shopping can include shelf-stable items for puppy kong stuffing like canned fish or pumpkin puree. You might also want to catch up with friends in advance unless you think they'll come visit puppy for socialization, since you won't be able to go out socially for awhile.

One of our puppy class trainers also had people do this for the specific case of encouraging more healthy interaction between an overly confident puppy (leashed) and an overly timid puppy. The leash allowed the timid one to approach at its own speed while preventing the bold one from chasing it and scaring it. I'm not a trainer but it seemed to work well for that purpose.

A different puppy class trainer always had playtime between a subset of the dogs at a time while the others were leashed and encouraged to watch quietly and practice the engage/disengage game, which is tough but excellent practice for impulse control and reducing leash reactivity in the future. They didn't allow the off-leash puppies to harass the leashed ones though, which is important."

Trainers mostly train you instead of the dog. So you're probably old enough.

That said, I would strongly suggest puppy classes rather than a solo trainer at this point (or you could do both if you want, but if I had to pick one I'd do classes every time). The socialization and learning to behave in a room with distractions is extremely valuable, and the puppy trainers will also give advice on all the typical puppy stuff like what you're describing here. You'll also get to commiserate with other people going through the same thing, which really helps.

edit: just saw the part about him being rescued extremely early. In this case you really need to provide as much interaction as you possibly can with other puppies now (even more than a puppy class) to make up for him missing that crucial time with his siblings. A lot of very important social skills are learned from those interactions, including learning not to bite everyone as hard as they possibly can."

It's very dangerous to use a kong that's too small (choking and obstruction risk) and it's not ideal for your puppy to use one that's too big (safe, but less comfortable).  

Unless you have a very tiny breed, it sounds like your current kong may be far too small to be safe. Make sure you check the suggested weight range. I would suggest getting one that's a good size for your puppy's current weight and then put it away and get bigger ones later. We did a medium at first and now use L and XL."

I did avoid going for a few litters that looked like they might be mixed with some breeds I'd prefer to skip (mostly terriers and bully breed mixes). 

I did try to figure out what breeds my puppy was likely to be mixed with (based on mom and litter appearance, plus what's common in that area) and made sure I was fine with handling the toughest breed traits that could pop up. The husky part was my main concern and I did a lot of research on physical and mental stimulation to see if I could manage one in ways that I'd be happy with in the long term - e.g. I hate running so I looked up some ways to give her physical exercise without running myself.

It's an even more reasonable fee when you consider that puppies are very much in-demand here (random non-vetted backyard bred mutt puppies are sold for around 500-1000 usually, ""designer"" mutts for thousands, reputable breeders somewhere in between).

You can also play educational games with him, like encouraging him to chase you, playing tug, and starting to teach fetch. 

It's normal for them to get more energetic and obnoxious (and bitey) as they get comfortable in their new home and as they start teething.

It does get a lot better after teething ends, though."
puppy101,feaaj0w,t3_eo8wqb,1578946302.0,"As a general rule in life, you're under no obligation at all to allow random strangers to lecture you. They're being rude which means you can be equally rude - even turn and walk away mid-sentence if you feel like it. You don't need to stand there politely while they rip you to shreds for 20 minutes. 

As another general rule in life, if someone says something that shows they are deeply misinformed about a topic (like suggesting a prong collar for a 4 month old puppy or ""not believing"" in socialization), chances are the rest of their knowledge in that area is equally incorrect and can be safely ignored. 

As a third general rule in life, base your decisions on research gathered from trusted sources rather than unwanted opinions from random strangers who stop you on the street to lecture you."
puppy101,fe96gzy,t1_fe8zxtv,1578934802.0,"Yeah, I suspect the (probable) part GSD of mine is a factor. We've had some leash reactivity as well but that has gotten a lot better with the mark and treat method like you're doing, starting as far away from the trigger as possible. She almost never barks on walks now unless it's something totally new like recently the christmas inflatables and people on cross-country skis, though staring and occasional lunging is still an issue for us with some people and pretty much all dogs. 

If she's already reacting on leash/not turning to me when I say ""yes"", I've had some success with sticking a good treat right under her nose and luring her to face me/take a few steps away, then either luring to continue away or trying the mark and treat again with the added distance if she's relatively calm. I'll also pull her a bit further away on the leash as a last resort (e.g. the trigger is coming closer and I'm in the middle of the sidewalk and luring doesn't work). This isn't intended to be training, just damage control if you accidentally go over threshold. Scattering treats in that scenario sometimes works but isn't always enough to break the fixated stare if she's really locked in. Not really sure why it seems to work better in the backyard even when she's already barking."
puppy101,fe8y0yx,t1_fe8qjhd,1578932220.0,"The behaviours you describe are NOT normal for a 6 month old puppy (in your own words, this is an ""unusual"" puppy). Doubly so for a puppy that's half golden, a breed known for being remarkably stranger-friendly and tolerant.

This puppy has not been socialized at all - you say yourself that the farm environment is ""all she's known"" until now. This fact alone means that the breeder was not reputable - absolute best case, they're just clueless about socializing and didn't abuse the puppy. A lack of socialization even in a perfectly loving home can still create life-long mental and behaviour problems for the puppy. Worst case, they may have mistreated the puppies as well.

You can't go back in time and choose a better breeder, but if you keep this puppy you need to accept that it's very undersocialized and afraid, and commit to making up for lost time with confidence-building exercises and careful exposure that doesn't overwhelm your fragile pup. This may require the help of a professional depending how severe the behaviour is and how your puppy responds to your socialization efforts.

Will you be able to socialize the puppy enough to make up for its bad start in life and eventually have a mentally stable adult dog? Maybe, maybe not - depends how resilient the puppy is and how bad the environment was. But you certainly won't be able to until you accept that there is a problem and work on fixing it."
puppy101,fe8tc7n,t3_eo59na,1578930634.0,"We have been working on alert barking in the backyard for many many months now (it started around 4-5 months old). It's tough! The triggers are often unclear which makes it so much harder. 

We have tried teaching a quiet command, leave it, distracting with other commands like look or sit, calling her inside, the ""thanking"" thing, pulling her inside on a leash, etc. We've also spent TONS of time with her outside waiting for a trigger to show up and treating for counter conditioning and/or distracting with commands, playtime etc. We are always nearby watching like a hawk to interrupt the barking to reduce self-reinforcement. Pretty much all the advice out there. All of this worked sometimes and we've seen a little progress but not if she's overly interested in the scary thing. It's been frustrating. 

Recently I've **finally** been having some success by taking a big step back and just throwing a handful of kibbles on the ground and calling ""find it"", which she knows means a treat 100% of the time. She's much much better about listening to that than to a ""real"" command when she's all wound up, and after sniffing out all the kibbles she's not hyperfocused on the trigger anymore so she's much more likely to listen to other commands. 

I'll do it whenever she barks but I also try hard to interrupt it before she starts by watching closely for her to focus and perk up at something. I also do it randomly at other times, to hopefully reduce the odds of her starting to bark on purpose. It's much easier to prevent her from barking now with this method, and I'm hopeful that with enough time practicing not barking around her triggers, she'll learn to do it on her own.

If it's happening on leash and you can see the triggers from far away, it's a little easier to manage - distance and gradual exposure is the way to go in that case. If you aren't already aware, r/reactivedogs may be a helpful resource for you."
puppy101,fe8isql,t3_eo3erh,1578926616.0,"It gets well below that in my city (very often below -20C with windchill, occasionally even below -40) and most people still walk their dogs. Breeds with very short fur usually wear thick coats and booties etc and many people only do short walks on the coldest days. I would also be a lot more cautious with a very young puppy, regardless of breed. But something like a goldendoodle can definitely still be walked in the winter, especially in those relatively mild temperatures. 

Does he have any winter clothing now? As it gets colder you'll want to keep an eye on him and see if he's showing signs of being cold, and shorten the walks and/or increase the clothing in that case."
puppy101,fdnr3xy,t3_em8xs5,1578591201.0,"I don't see anything but shepherd - hard to tell which type at this age (GSD and dutch shepherds can both be brindle so I'd guess it's whichever is more common in your area). Those tilted ears in particular are very typical for a GSD puppy. If she's a mix, she leans heavily towards her shepherd side. She's going to be a gorgeous dog!

You may be able to tell more when she's older, or just go for a DNA test. I'd guess she will likely have a lot of GSD-like traits so read up on those and make sure you socialize her carefully. Puppy classes are great if you can manage it."
puppy101,fdhjvxf,t3_elepv1,1578424203.0,"It's never too late to start. Read the wiki sections on crate training and teaching a settle in addition to capturing calmness. 

Make sure that you do the settling/calmness training only after he's gotten enough mental and physical exercise. You have a mix of two very smart and high-energy breeds and he won't want to settle properly until those needs are met."
puppy101,fdhj8jn,t3_ekr5b1,1578423806.0,"The kong package tells you the recommended weight range for each size. At 8 weeks a medium should be fine for at least a few more weeks or longer depending how fast he grows. Once he gets big enough to fit it completely in his mouth I would take it away (or once he passes the suggested weight range, whatever comes first). 

He might have trouble cleaning out the bottom of a large at this age (my GSD-sized puppy couldn't for the first few weeks) so it's good to start him off with a more comfortable one for his current size anyway."
puppy101,fcwqhal,t3_eihcne,1578033634.0,"Most of my goals don't really have a timeline but these are the main ones:

* Work towards a relaxed nail trim again (she developed a hatred of paw handling so I'm working on classical conditioning for that)
* Work towards ability to pass a CGC test (mainly getting overly excited about dogs, plus strong leash pulling anywhere remotely interesting). I don't know if we'll get there in 2020 but I hope to see major improvement this year. 
* Improve behaviour and listening in distracting environments, which is currently a major challenge
* Aiming to get our intermediate and advanced trick dog titles by her first birthday next month (have the tricks learned, just need to film and submit)
* Would like to try out an agility class in late 2020, if we can improve leash manners around other dogs by then"
puppy101,fbfioro,t3_ed42bb,1576811547.0,"Please call your vet right now (or ER vet if after hours) and ask for advice, unless you've already discussed this with them (the extreme lethargy and loss of appetite). These are very concerning symptoms that require immediate assessment by a vet. Young puppies can go downhill very, very fast."
