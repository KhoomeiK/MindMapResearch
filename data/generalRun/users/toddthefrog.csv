Futurology,ffo6eei,t1_ffmcm12,1580074580.0,i’m curious if standard doses prescribed for bipolar disorder also have this effect. it would be pretty trivial to get the rate of incidence in bipolar patients and then compare them to the general population. this wouldn’t rule out some other mechanism that bipolar patients have to prevent alzheimers but it would be a a good study that possibly leads to human trials.

technology,ff9rd19,t1_ff9ln1q,1579719413.0,"rent control and utility price controls are akin to apples and oranges.  Utility price controls are proven to work and you personally save money every month because of them. You really should do some more research, don’t mistake anyone’s opinion for gospel (myself included). You have to self advocate for what’s in your best interest and and utility price controls truly are."

Yesterday I took my 5 year old daughter to a park to feed the ducks. My daughter shared some of the pellets with another young child and I mistakenly told my daughter “what do we say” meaning for her to say “you’re welcome” but it came across as if I was telling the other child to say thank you. I apologized and clarified what I meant but I felt like I came across as a rude asshole via a miscommunication.  The point I’m trying to make is, for me personally, there have to be about a million more steps of aggression that I can’t fathom being ok to cross before ever touching someone else’s child."
