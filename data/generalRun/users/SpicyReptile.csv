TalesFromTheCustomer,ffgzzk3,t1_fffe85n,1579919444.0,We had a professor in college who was so allergic to onions that the 4 story building his office was in had signs on all the entry doors saying onions are never allowed in this building. That's the only way I knew it was a thing.
college,ffgyysk,t1_ffgvzn7,1579918677.0,Universities and Colleges often have mental health care services provided to students at either low cost or for free (as they've already been paid for by student fees). I would highly suggest checking into seeing a therapist ASAP so you can get ahead of the curve on taking care of your mental health. They can help you learn how to stay accountable to yourself and deal with the inevitable stress of college. Please please do this for yourself!
Jung,ffbnm89,t1_ffbf1hq,1579774427.0,"Our culture associates femininity with being weak, less than, or ""soft."" Men have been taught to reject that part of themselves. It's the part associated with emotion. They quash their emotions because they've been bullied by society into doing so, lest they be seen as weak. So it's not that they directly fear confronting their femininity; it's that they fear how they will be seen and treated if they come off as weak. When a man has been repeatedly sanctioned from an early age whenever he shows emotion, he will fear that negative response. And they continue to get that negative response as teens and adults, from friends, family, society, and even their partners. So the cycle continues. It's a vicious and ugly pattern passed down through generations."

It appears on eBay too, but was much more affordable on amazon. I also met a woman on the bus about a week ago wearing the green version and seeing it in real life almost made me buy it!"

Pets,fej8dj0,t1_feitzku,1579161288.0,"This was one of the biggest reasons I knew it was time for my cat to be euthanized.  She was bleeding internally into her bladder, and her urine was almost pure blood.  She couldn't get off the bed to use the litter box, and she kept urinating on the bed.  She had stopped eating at about the same time and was barely drinking.  I could also see a white line around her eyes, which told me she was in pain.  She couldn't sleep well, either.  She kept waking up to readjust herself because she was so uncomfortable.  I wanted desperately to keep her around, but I could tell she was just so miserable. She was in so much pain; her discomfort was more important than my wish to keep her alive for my own selfish reasons."
college,fef8jii,t3_eomjwv,1579050715.0,"I basically treat school like a job. I dedicate 6-8 hours per day (including class time), on school. I make this happen 4-5 days per week. So if I have a 3 hour class, I spend 3-5 hours outside that class on homework, reading, and studying. I make sure to take a 5-10 minute break every hour or so. This allows me to budget time for my job and for me-time and usually one day off per week. I only work 1 or 2 days a week, which sucks for student loan reasons, but is good for mental health and long term goals. These tactics have gotten me to grad school, so I think they are working (:

As far as studying itself goes, I spend 30 minutes to an hour per day (4 or 5 days/week) going over past notes and readings. To retain knowledge long term, it's so important to repeatedly consume it."

And who is my family? Because since I am an adult and moved out of my parents house a decade ago, and so have my siblings, each little group has their own church practices."
college,fcjs8vz,t1_fcieuqf,1577702077.0,"I finished my BS at 28 after going back to school at 23 and found my age to be an advantage. I was more dedicated because I chose what I wanted for my life. I also had some time to work and begin to understand what adult life even is. I got to try different things and see what I'm good at, which partially informed my degree choice. I wasn't just forced into school by my parents; I did it 100% for myself."
AskWomen,fcc4fpq,t1_fcc2zzm,1577594295.0,"So true - I was taught when I was young it's somehow normal for women to be mean to each other, and that I shouldn't trust other women. I got super lucky and part of what helped me leave my old friend was that I met some women who are super supportive and know what it means to be reciprocal in a relationship. I wish mutual support and care was more normalized. I think we can do better."
AskWomen,fcbfyhj,t1_fcavrug,1577586385.0,"You have just described my ex best friend perfectly. I cut her off 3 years ago and sometimes I still hear her critical voice in my head. I often struggled to explain what exactly she was saying or doing that made me feel so bad when I was around her. She was subtle about bullying me. She would call me and vent to me about her drama for an hour, then finally ask me what was going on in my life, and cut me off after a couple sentences reminded her of something terrible in her own life. My ex husband could never understand when I tried to tell him, and I'm pretty sure he is still friends with her.

The final straw for her was at her wedding (which I officiated), she treated me like I was disposable and unimportant. I had done several projects to help her and she never thanked me. She asked me to serve food at her wedding. And she couldn't remember the name of my partner who I'd been dating for more than a year. After he and I left, I was venting to him about how she had been treating me, and he validated what I was experiencing. He said he saw it and felt it too. Finally someone heard the pain I'd been going through trying to be her friend. So I left her in the dust."
relationships,fbzpdrc,t1_fbzf7qb,1577255073.0,"Look into ""Love Bombing.""  This is a tactic manipulative people use to try to get someone to begin a relationship with them.  It sounds like this is what he is doing to your girlfriend.  Because of the age difference, he is more experienced in life and I wouldn't be surprised if he's tried this before - and it's probably worked.

Try to understand that your girlfriend is being manipulated and she is probably confused.  Be supportive of her.  The last thing she needs is for you to be angry at her, and then this guy be all warm and welcoming...

Tell her you are concerned about HER, you want to support HER, and you will be there for HER.  Don't make it about the guy.  Make it about her safety.
