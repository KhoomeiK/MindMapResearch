Although other games work quite well, like BF5, here are the install notes:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/9x9f79/psa\_bf5\_works\_great\_in\_linux/ebzudsd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/9x9f79/psa_bf5_works_great_in_linux/ebzudsd/)

 

This is with WINE - 3.21-protonified-tkg DXVK - 0.94 ESYNC on with nofile limit corrected and feral gamemode.

Its  worth noting im on a Nvidia GTX 1080 so my environmental variables have  some nvidia specific things, you should change these for AMD.

Of  course with my compositor off as well (For me on KDE thats  Alt+Shift+f12). But lutris should usually notice when its a fullscreen  app and turn it off for you. With origin running first that doesnt  always work so its good to know how to manually turn off your compositor  if you use one. Here are my steps

1. (prerequisites)  make sure you have wine and dxvk on your computer. Also with esync  nofile limit (changed) and Feral gamemode. Then glorius eggrolls get out  of wine dependency hell. This is kind of a catch-all for any Microsoft  fonts or issues.
2. Install  the lutris script for BF5, let it install origin. When the window pops  up close (it may do this on it's own Give it a minute) it and let the  installer finish.
3. Right  click on the BF5 game on lutris and hit configure. head over to the  runner options tab. Set wine version to (current as of time of posting)  3.21 protonified tkg - to get this click lutris and manage runners, go  to wine and download latest tkg. enable DXVK and set to current highest  (0.94 for me) enable esync. I turn off the virtual desktop and let it  run fullscreen. Thats preference.
4. Now  go to the system options tab. enable feral gamemode and I have monitor  one on my Fullscreen SDL game to display (I found this helps with proper  resolution when game starts). In environmental variables I have:  DXVK\_HUD = devinfo,version,fps DXVK\_STATE\_CACHE\_PATH =  /home/grixin/Games/battlefield-v WINEESYNC = 1 \_\_GL\_SHADER\_DISK\_CACHE = 1  \_\_GL\_SHADER\_DISK\_CACHE\_PATH =  /home/grixin/Games/battlefield-v/bfv-shaders  \_\_GL\_SHADER\_DISK\_CACHE\_SKIP\_CLEANUP = True \_\_GL\_THREADED\_OPTIMIZATIONS =  1

This should finish up  the settings. You can turn on origin and install the game. If it stops  part way through just start the download again until it finishes. It  might stop on you a few times. After this is complete disable origin in  game and have fun!

Now for a few gotchas or workarounds:

1. If  this origin screen is white when you log in this means your origin is  out of date. There is a script in lutris for this. You can click the  stop button on your lutris to kill all the processes for origin. then  right click on the game banner and hit execute script. Wait a few  minutes (the script will update your origin in the background) there  will be no confirmation its running. When you log back in this should be  fixed.
2. If  there is a game update and you can not download the update (the game  says update available). You can turn off DXVK and this should allow you  to install the update. Afterwards you can kill the origin processes with  stop on lutris and turn DXVK and go back to fragging.
3. Battlefield  games like to start in a small windows when loading then take over the  screen, you should all know what that looks like. Sometimes when it goes  fullscreen it will not show the proper resolution. Like it forgot to  click over from the really small one. The fullscreen SDL game to display  really helped me with that one. If this happens you may need to use  your arrow keys and space bar to exit game and try again. Its a weird  sometimes it happens most times it doesnt kind of thing. The protonified  version of wine should help with this too.

I really hope this helps others and if anything needs to be change or clarified let me know and I will edit the post."

Take it out with a net, hose, string, ball, anything really except a air rifle or firearm - all while wearing non-descript clothes and a hat.

Now with the drone disabled in your property you have some options:

NOTE: remove the drone's battery out of view of it's camera before handling it.

1. leave it and claim and if asked about a drone in your backyard - you DIDN'T notice it
2. Take it inside and wait to see if someone comes for it and say you found it crashed in your yard
3. Throw it in the trash behind a Pizza hut or something."

Once that verdict is given the person in question will then spend an indeterminate amount of time in a mental health facility (Most likely a forensic ward on a DHB campus) until they are no longer a danger to others or themselves. 

This verdict does not mean they are free to go out onto the street just like that."
