Justrolledintotheshop,ffdx4y7,t1_ffdv7yn,1579831115.0,"That is a bit ridiculous. For the most part, the roads in Virginia are nowhere near as open as the roads I've seen from videos in your neck of the woods. For us to have even one km between bends without a hill is unusual on some roads. Thankfully, we don't have many one-lane bridges here. 
Speed governors are a major issue, but mostly on divided highways. Trucks don't often overtake other trucks on two-lane roads, unless one pulls over on a hard shoulder. On the divided roads, it's horrible. My truck is governed at 65mph, and so are many (but not all) others. I barely gross more than 30t, so I can usually hold my own going up hills. However, done greedy idiots want to race down said hills."

Justrolledintotheshop,ffdep42,t1_ffcy0ww,1579819302.0,"Yeah. Last Friday, on the way from Kill Devil Hills, NC to Rocky Mount, VA, I was heading west on VA-40, which is a two-lane highway. I was entering a section I call the roller coaster because of the rolling hills. It's dead straight for a few miles. I saw a couple vehicles heading towards me, but they were a mile apart. I figured that I'd meet the first one at the top of the second hill. I did, along with one vehicle that just overtook said vehicle, and a Dodge Ram 2500 that was trying to overtake said vehicle. There was no way the Dodge driver could've gotten back into the correct lane in time without hitting the vehicle being overtaken. Instead of hitting me head-on, the driver hit the soft shoulder and drive around me that way, never coming to a complete stop. I, on the other hand, did come to a complete stop, along with another motorist who was following the convoy of stupidity.
The Dodge driver tried to overtake on a solid yellow line... on a blind hill... at night. This was within 300' of where I witnessed a car vs deer collision a while back."
