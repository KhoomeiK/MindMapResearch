Although I've heard the thicc pancakes are much sweeter than flapjacks cuz they're essentially full on cakes made in a pan."

Some, though not all, of the headaches could be psychosomatic because your body has gotten used to eating at certain times. Sometimes the frustration of not eating canead to an anxiety that you should be eating which along with lower ectrolytes can cause a headache.

Electrolytes is a good idea. Telling yourself that eating does not have to follow a predestined clock and that you are instead allowing your body to really use the food that you are during your previous eating window can help with some negative feelings. Taken together electrolytes and positive self talk can help big time with fasting headaches."

Something that may help is joining a group or a social club. For instance if you're interested in board games or something sports related then you can go to a comic book store or travel top store and see if they have table top game sign ups or something like that. All a friendship needs to blossom is time and proximity. You can be friends with just about anyone by just hanging out with them a lot. The crappy thing is as an adult you gotta make opportunities for yourself. You don't have college or high school artificially grouping people together and then forcing friendships.

I took a hiatus similar to you and I feel exactly the way you do. I can not for the life of me understand how people ""adult"" meaning feeling comfortable with expressing themselves around other adults. In essence feeling comfortable with adulting. What my friends have told me is every single person is taking it. Tbe entire world of adults is faking it and figuring it out on the go. 

If this is at all helpful, for now feel really good about the progress you've already made. Life isn't a sprint. It's not a marathon. It's just life. You are not behind people, you are not in front of people, you are exactly where you need to be."

offmychest,fgck0xs,t1_fgc2ic4,1580673337.0,"I'm kinda curious. If your husband were doing something similar, would you be okay with it?

Maybe passing judgement is inappropriate but I can't imagine you'd be as cavaliar about how you handle this situation if you considered how you would feel if your husband were doing something similar.

The other guy has a wife as well. Your guys' action affect people outside of this fling. Something to consider. Or not."
