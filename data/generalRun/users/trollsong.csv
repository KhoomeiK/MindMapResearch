UpliftingNews,ff6ouuv,t1_ff6lsxf,1579631784.0,"Right
A straw man purchase is where person A gives person B money to buy gun from store C

This is literally person A purchasing from private seller C.

You literally just agreed with me with your very own definition.

https://gunsandamerica.org/story/19/09/04/what-makes-a-gun-sale-private/

Read the whole thing.

Federal Law
First, let’s talk about federal law. It serves as a sort of regulatory floor, below which no state can drop.

According to federal law, any licensed dealer who sells a gun must first conduct a background check. It’s required whether the sale happens inside a gun store, at a gun show or on the shoulder of a backcountry road. They key factor is if the seller has a federal firearms license (FFL), they must conduct a background check.

Now, not all licensed sellers have store fronts. Many operate small businesses out of their home or garage. In 2017, there were about 135,000 licensed dealers across the country, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).

Anyone else who sells a gun — be they a stranger, neighbor, friend or relative — is conducting a private transaction. 

So for example, a gun collector who has rented a table at a gun show can sell guns through private transaction, so long as they aren’t engaged in buying and selling guns as a business (in the eyes of the ATF, though there’s no clear cut answer to what “being in business” means according to the ATF).

If a gun show attendee who is not a licensed dealer wants to sell a gun, they are also free to do so without conducting a background check, at least under federal law. This is where the phrase “gun show loophole” comes from. It’s an imperfect and controversial term, but it does represent a real phenomenon.

Under federal law, certain individuals such as convicted felons and out-of-state residents are not allowed to buy guns. A private transaction could become illegal if the buyer falls into one of those categories, or fails to meet other criteria.

But the seller is under no obligation to ask about those things. So long as a private seller does not knowingly sell a gun to a prohibited person, they are not breaking federal law.



SO with your Straw man argument.

In a court of law

PROVE that the seller KNEW the person he was selling to was a felon."
UpliftingNews,ff6ofsn,t1_ff6mr1c,1579631529.0,"Except for this is an instance where they can claim ignorance and not be charged.  
It is legal for them to see a gun to someone without a background check.  
""Well officer I asked and they said they have had no prior felonies, there is no way for me to check that"""
UpliftingNews,ff6n5gp,t1_ff6kyi0,1579630751.0,">Gun safety should have nothing to do with the government and everything to do with society. Stop teaching impressionable teens that ""gUnS r bAd"" and start teaching them responsibility. 

We arent though, well not everyone, We are teaching them guns are cool and rad, which is arguably worse. Hell EA used to sell advertising space to gun manufacturers to make sure that gun companies could associate them being awesome with FPS games.


> Forcing people to do something does not teach the values on to them. Showing somebody HOW to do something is not the same thing as showing the WHY. For me personally, having my father sit down with me from a young age and explain the responsibility of owning a firearm was infinitely more valuable then lining up with 50+ people at a police station so I could learn that ""trigger make boom where barrel go"" would be

And there are a lot of Private driving instructors so the government doesn't necessarily need to be in charge of training, just make it a requirement to be trained, Hell every gun store that isnt a pawn shop in my area has training and a range, they can handle the classes.

It is great that your pops was able to teach you, not everyone has that luxury. And I'd rather them be well trained then a danger to themselves and others.

>The reality is, in western society 99.9% of gun owners understand the responsibility they shoulder. Theres something like 400 million guns in the US alone. If we didnt know what we were dealing with we wouldn't have the man power to dig the graves.

No offense but I doubt the veracity of that statistic.

>Almost every mass shooting happens in ""gun-free"" zones. Gun-free? Right. That worked out great. Its gotta be a cultural revolution of our youth. You wanna stop mass shootings? Stop saying shit like ""yea but who cares? In a hundred thousand years it wont matter."" That's exactly what the Columbine kids thought. Stop teaching kids that their job is to uproot western civilization and bring forth the utopia. They're fucking children, they dont know anything. Most of us dont, in fact.

I am not sure where to begin with this.
The problem with the idea of mass shootings all happening in Gun free zones is mixed. One you arent right because a few have happened on military bases.

And you may be right in theory about more guns fixing the problem. But that isnt correct all the time.

Statistically if suddenly there were a lot more guns in the hands of adults at schools. I can guarantee you that more kids would suffer, specifically black kids. 
Hell simple disrespect from children is met with brutal violence and body slamming and tasers.
Add a lot more guns to the mix and it will end badly.

But I know it isnt directed at me, and yea I dont think no guns at all is the solution.

But one thing you have to understand is that guns may be a ""right"" But it is also a privilege. Because a White person with a Gun and a black person with a gun is perceived very differently from one another.

I guarantee all the pro gun politicians would have no trouble turning anti gun if it specifically targeted black people.
Because Reagan did just that.

You being able to say all of this is a privilege.

All I want as far as control is

1) Either universal background checks, or start heavily enforcing that private gun owners shouldnt be selling.

2) Mandatory training so we dont have a bunch of cowboys thinking they are heroes.

As far as everyone that brings up mental health screenings, There is literally no way to do that without it being abused by the government so no. We just need better mental health services.(les expensive and more readily available.)"
