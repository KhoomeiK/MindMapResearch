TalesFromRetail,fdl232t,t3_elv1rh,1578515724.0,"Can I just say this? All of these stories, while many are true to a certain point, are typed like every sales associate making 11 bucks an hour is the most polite and accommodating associate possible. Again, I totally believe most of the basis of these stories. But the amount of times I have read ""Oh- I am sorry ma'am, but I am unable to..."" or something very similar it just makes me cringe. We all know it didn't go down like that, this sub is just a circle jerk for underpaid retail people that claim to have been way more accommodating than they were, and the other person is simply insane. Again, I get it. Assfaces happen. But reading over this sub makes you think retail people are the most professional, happy and overall good sales associates of all time.

I just had to finally say it."
