In my experience, if you have full coverage on your personal car, they usually include rental car coverage."
CFBOffTopic,ff37pmn,t1_ff36f9x,1579535669.0,Sounds like a plan. I'd also double check and make sure your insurance covers rentals (or get their insurance) and make sure you allow for the fact that they're also going to hold a couple hundred bucks on your card while you have the car in addition to the cost of the rental.
CFBOffTopic,ff33nuy,t1_ff31v78,1579532854.0,"You can request a class of car. Usually when it lists a specific model of car, it's a car like that model. So if you request a Suburban, you may get a Nissan Armada instead. It's the same size, but a different model.

About the only company that guarantees a specific model of car is Go Rentals and they're super pricey.

Usually if you call in and tell them how much seating capacity you need, they'll note it in the reservation too. Rental companies also bill for the whole day even if you only use it for a few hours, so I would overestimate how long you're going to need the cars. 

Lastly, there's usually not a cancellation fee, so it's not a bad idea to book pretty far in advance and cancel it if you end up not needing it."

I generally just offered an interview to everyone that applied because it was an entry level job and I found a lot of the time the people who scored highly on the questionnaire were people that learned to give high scoring answers and a lot of the time there'd be lower scoring candidates who were a better fit for the job, but were relatively new to the whole process and didn't know how to work the system as well."
