As mentioned in other comment threads, though, I'm not exactly the best at drawing them into attention. Others generally notice I'm twitching before I do."
AMA,fcy04wz,t1_fcxv5k5,1578072798.0,"My most common one's today (because they change) are a jerky head tilt, a huffy ""hmm"" sounding noise, and a shoulder shrug. These three tend to happen at the same time. I also occasionally have a very spammy eye blink and... I'm not sure how to describe this. Like, I'll put my big toe over my second toe and flick it over and over again, and I'll snap or flick my fingers, but these last couple of ones are less common. When they do come, they tend to come in groups, so I'll get several going off at one time.

I ran into a wall once because I didn't realize I was having eyelid twitches, but that was a while ago. I started taking medication back when I was in 5th grade and that's since helped to make the twitches a bit less noticeable. I'm sure they still occasionally happen, but my whole problem is not realizing when they do happen, so I'm too ignorant to be embarrassed when I'm twitching like I'm possessed. Ignorance is bliss I guess?"

AMA,fcxxtd6,t1_fcxtfqa,1578072016.0,"Obviously everyone has different ticks (what you call the twitches) and experiences regarding them, but for me personally they're like really incessant twitches. They go away when I draw my attention to them, so if someone were to say, ""Hey, OP, you're twitching again"" I'll stop, but the problem is most of the time I don't realize when it's happening. 

I used to have an eye twitch (ticks change from time to time) where my eyelids would blink really hard and really fast, and I remember one time running into a wall before I realized it was happening at all so... yeah. My self-awareness isn't really reliable.

My mom and brother also have motor ticks/Tourettes, but from what I gather the whole ""stop when you draw attention to it"" is fairly rare. So I guess I kind of lucked out. At the same time, though, it also means I can't stop them through behavioral therapy which is apparently a new thing people are trying out."
AMA,fcxwjen,t1_fcxtg1z,1578071483.0,"1.) No, the stereotypes aren't true at all. Think of it like having repeated twitches. These twitches are called ticks. I do have vocal ticks, but they're simple sounds, much like how my other ticks are just simple, jerky movements. My most common ticks (currently, anyway. They can change from time to time) are shoulder shrugs, jerky head tilts, and a kind of huffy ""hmm"" or ""hmpf"" kind of sound. Usually, the three happen all at once. Obviously Tourettes is different for everyone who has it, but I don't know of anyone who's tick makes them say actual words.

2.) No, as previously mentioned I don't say actual words, but I was bullied heavily for it in 5th grade.

3.) Same answer as 2.

4.) The bullying was pretty bad back in elementary school, but I started taking medication for it which, while not completely getting rid of them, helped lower it down to a significantly less-noticeable level. I also used to have a blinking twitch which would affect one eye more than the other (ticks tend to change, so this isn't really much of a problem anymore), which got me in trouble one time because a teacher thought I was trying to wink.

5.) Nah, I don't mind. It just takes me some time to type my answers up, is all."
