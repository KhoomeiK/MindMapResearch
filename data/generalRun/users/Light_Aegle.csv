college,fej3418,t3_epdxst,1579155099.0,I know it's not assigned but it's a unspoken rule that once you sit there it's your seat. If you break that rule I'll probably hold a small grudge against you

TheWalkingDeadGame,fdoboo0,t1_fdnaakf,1578602273.0,I'm wondering that same thing. It would have been so much better to have Clem as the main character. At least that way Kenny would not have been killed off in a flashback.
college,fdmhe6k,t3_em4xse,1578549976.0,These seem like questions you might want to ask your advisor OP
college,fdmh88u,t3_em593w,1578549816.0,"I took classical philosophy a while back and absolutely hated it. But this was mostly because the professor was horrible and just didn't do any work at all. For sociology I loved it, it's a really interesting subject and I'm taking Principles of Soc this semester. 

Overall rather or not your class will be bearable really depends on your professor. That and how well you usually do in classes like them.

Good luck to us both either way!"
