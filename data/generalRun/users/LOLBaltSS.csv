Me with a M1919 or him with a K98 scoped getting headshots on me before I could train back on him.  The majority of our kills/deaths were just each other.

Or getting with the vendor on why their bullshit app requires local admin to perform X-Y-Z tasks. Basically you need to have a working understanding to the enemy that you're battling and determine if there's a workaround.

Usually in my experience, it's because said applications are trying to write to naughty areas because the developer(s) working on it had local admin on their machine and didn't want to fix their mess afterwards.

I think that's by design.  Guys like Bezos benefit from Republican led tax cuts and deregulation.  The configuration of the Senate and Electoral College favors cramming people who vote on the left end of the spectrum into as few areas as possible.  It's effectively socioeconomic-based packing.  Even in other states, there's been a consolidation of left votes which causes the state to end up with more Republican held districts.  Here in Texas and my former home state of PA, most of the left areas are cities because that's where the jobs are meanwhile most areas outside are blood red.  Pennsylvania is known as the ""T"" in the fact that it's basically Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Alabama in between."
