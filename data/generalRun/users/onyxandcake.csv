AskReddit,ffylb08,t1_ffyj9ix,1580349143.0,"Rape is a very small portion of abortions. Ignorance of biology is pretty high though. Do you have any idea what percentage of women think that you pee out of the same hole you bleed out of? or how many don't know that you have to take the pill at the exact same time everyday and that it is ineffective if you're on antibiotics? I have a friend who has had multiple abortions, guess which birth control method should used in high school? The rhythm method. She was told it was less sinful than the pill. 

You want abortion to stop? Start petitioning for real and comprehensive sex education beginning in grade 5. No religious exemptions. No parents being able to opt out. No abstinence-only curriculum. No schools allowed to cut it from their programming because they needed more money for the basketball team to make it to regionals."

And historically, making them illegal doesn't cut down on the amount happening, it just increases the danger to the mother. So now, instead of a $400 abortion, your ""tax dollars"" are paying for the increased costs to repair back alley surgery complications. 

My Vietnamese friend confided to me that she didn't know how to prevent babies until after her second child... Think about that, before getting on your high horse about how easy it is to prevent pregnancy. I also had to teach her, a 35 year old business owner, that you pee out of a different hole.
