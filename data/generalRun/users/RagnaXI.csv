sports,ffsiho9,t1_ffsgi9g,1580182513.0,"I was shocked reading that he died in a helicopter crash, never before had a celebrities death impacted me as it did with Kobe, I'm not even from the US.

I always admired him and played basketball because of people like him for years, Robin Williams was one of my favorite actors and his death was shocking too but the thing with Kobe is I just can't comprehend that he's gone, when I saw the headline yesterday I was in complete shock, I think mostly because he was so damn young and still had so many years ahead of him and then just to be taken in an instant, especially reading that his daughter died too.

I honestly don't know who I feel more sorry for, Kobe and Gianna because they were so young or Kobe's wife and daughters. And same for all the passenger who died in that crash, it's just horrible.

I would feel the same for Ronaldo, it doesn't matter who it is, no one should die so young."

I'm European and I've never ever wore shoes inside the house for longer than 10 seconds, as a kid I used to live in flats most of them had floor heating (Switzerland) but even those without (When I moved back to Bosnia) we would never wear shoes inside a house, socks and slippers were enough if you would ever get cold, which was rarely so.

We built a house with floor heating and it's amazing, we don't have the mentality to wear shoes inside the house here thankfully, but whenever I have shoes on inside the house or try on new shoes at home I always feel like I'm not at home or feel free.

I'll never get how people can say it's cleaner with shoes on, or how they feel comfortable wearing them inside the house.
