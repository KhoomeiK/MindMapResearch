happycryingdads,fc6fx84,t3_egc3pz,1577479635.0,"I did something similar for my mom. My grandfather did a solo canoe trip when he was 72 years old. He paddled the entire length of the Assiniboine river starting somewhere in Saskatchewan and ending in Winnipeg. He kept a journal along the way and recorded his adventures and the people he met. When he passed away, I had it printed on beautiful paper with heron watermarks on it and got it bound in leather. It made her so happy."
