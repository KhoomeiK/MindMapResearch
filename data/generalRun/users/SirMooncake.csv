Every single drop of water I drank was immediately puked out. I honestly thought that I was going to die. I got no sleep and no water whatsoever. There was absolutely nothing to puke anymore, yet I went through the motion. 
Eventually, I started puking this green liquid. 
At a certain point in time, I honestly just wanted to die. I’m not even joking. I wanted to die for real. 
Eventually, it got a little bit better one morning (got like three hours of consistent sleep) and I managed to get some water in my system. 
Unless I will literally die if I don’t— I will never again take antibiotics. It completely wiped out my entire gut flora. Before this experience, my stance on vomiting was pretty funny and neutral; But as soon as I get a acid-like feeling in my chest now, I become instantly terrified. Fucking traumatic I tell ya.

I’m also afraid that I’ll never really figure out what I’m supposed to work with. That I’ll always have jobs I hate and will never find one that I’m actually meant to do. I work now, but I hate my job. Though, I’ve no clue what-else to apply for.
