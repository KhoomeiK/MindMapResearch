dogs,fdb6bea,t3_ekhsqo,1578254316.0,"My dog used to be a stray. He was sick, matted, starving, and all alone on the streets for who knows how long. If he passes away from old age or if we only get a few years with him, it makes me feel better to know he had a life full of love with us before dying, rather than dying alone and unloved as a stray. Thatâ€™s the sad reality for many dogs and it breaks my heart thinking about it. Iâ€™m just happy we got to give our boy another chance at happiness. So when itâ€™s his time Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll be devastated, but Iâ€™ll also be happy that we got to make him happy for some of his life, because the thought of him dying alone on the street or being euthanized in a shelter is even more devastating."

AskReddit,fcm9ylz,t3_ehn3ua,1577768261.0,"Going gluten free! Unless you have Celiac, an allergy, or another medical reason why you canâ€™t eat gluten, going gluten free really has no health benefits. It wonâ€™t make you lose weight either. Cutting back on carbs will help, but just specifically avoiding gluten is pointless. A lot of the â€œsubstituteâ€ packaged gluten free products, like bread, cookies, muffins, etc. are just as unhealthy, if not worse, than their regular counterparts. Also, most gluten free bread and pasta isnâ€™t enriched with vitamins like their regular counterparts are. Take it from someone who has Celiac, be grateful you can eat your favorite glutinous foods and find a different, better way to eat healthy!"

Someone can have great recommendations, tons of relevant experience, and an awesome GPA and still bomb the GRE because they didnâ€™t spend months studying test strategies. Clearly you did well enough to have a great GPA and for professors to recommend you, that should say enough about your intelligence and ability to work hard. I wish you luck in your applications!"

BodyAcceptance,fc2zwxa,t3_efxbvf,1577378290.0,"I totally understand where youâ€™re coming from. I only feel comfortable with pictures being taken of me if my hair & makeup are done and Iâ€™m wearing a decent outfit, and even then I still donâ€™t like how the pics come out the majority of the time. You just have to stand up for yourself. Put your foot down and be firm. Say no thank you, I donâ€™t want to be in any pictures today. People will try to argue but just be firm. I had to do that yesterday at Christmas. Hereâ€™s another solution that I use, though it really only works with close friends or family members. Iâ€™ll let them take the picture, and then look at it. If I really hate it, I just ask them not to post it anywhere. This works well with my mom and grandma, because they care more about having the pics for themselves and their own memories more than posting it on social media. So we just have an agreement that they wonâ€™t post any pics I hate. And honestly I donâ€™t mind if my my mom and grandma have ugly pictures of me, because they see me looking gross in person all the time!"

femalefashionadvice,fc0j7kj,t1_fc09jwf,1577292028.0,"OH my god I totally relate. I am petite... except for my shoulders for some reason. I have wide shoulders for my size and it makes me so insecure that I have these big ass shoulders and then a flat chest. I basically avoid wearing anything strapless, like tube tops, because it accentuates this weird difference."
femalehairadvice,fc0ivm3,t3_efe3eg,1577291816.0,"When I was around 11 or  12, my hair started doing the same thing. It had always been kinda wavy but.... once I hit puberty it became puffy, frizzy and out of control! Eventually during high school it got really curly and looked awesome. Now iâ€™m 22 and itâ€™s losing itâ€™s curl and going back to how it was when I was a kid. Basically, changing hormones will affect your hair and skin and puberty sucks at first. As you get older it might calm down a little. I agree you should give the curly girl method a try and not straighten your hair regularly, but honestly donâ€™t feel too guilty if you wanna straighten it once and a while for special occasions. Also, I would recommend staying away from bleaching your hair. Especially if you have dark hair. That will just fry your hair and make it worse."
BodyAcceptance,fbztr3o,t3_ef3ncx,1577261082.0,"Hi! My best friend is about your height. Sheâ€™s definitely small, itâ€™s obvious. But thatâ€™s not what people know her for. Sheâ€™s an incredibly sweet person, everyone who knows her loves her bright personality. Sheâ€™s so smart, super funny, and will always bring a smile to your face.  Sheâ€™s an amazing friend who genuinely cares so much about the people in her life. Sheâ€™s a social worker, out there making a difference in the world. She has a beautiful smile and a great sense of style. When I think about her or when someone asks me about her, her height doesnâ€™t even come to mind. If you ask any of our friends about her, they wonâ€™t say â€œthe short girlâ€, theyâ€™ll tell you sheâ€™s the sweetest person they know. Itâ€™s impossible to stop people from making first impressions or snap judgments about you. It happens to everyone and yeah it sucks. I hate being treated like a child too just because Iâ€™m small and look way younger than I am. I canâ€™t even count how many times Iâ€™ve been asked what high school I go to since Iâ€™ve graduated college in May! But I know thatâ€™s not who I am and the people I care about donâ€™t see me that way. Once someone gets beyond the first impression, theyâ€™ll begin to see me for who I really am too. I know it feels almost impossible to get over.... but what helps for me is trying to see myself the way my loved ones see me. Am I a strangerâ€™s first impression, or am I my best friend of over 10 yearâ€™s impression? I know itâ€™s not that easy, because I still struggle with these insecurities every day. Itâ€™s so hard to not see myself the way I know those strangers see me. But if you tell yourself something every day it will eventually begin to stick. Donâ€™t let those first impressions stick, ask your friends & family what their favorite things are about you and repeat those over and over instead. I wish I had a better solution for you. Iâ€™m still struggling too and so far this is the best Iâ€™ve come up with."
