ynab,femrg0g,t3_eq063h,1579267470.0,"Two things to make using credit cards easy in YNAB:

First, you need to know if you are riding the credit card float.  This is a situation where you believe that you are a paid-in-full credit card user, but you have to put everything on the card during the month because you have no cash in your bank account.  Then when you get paid, you pay off the card, *but that leaves you no cash in your bank account* so you have to put everything on the card ...  In essence, you are paying for this pay period’s expenses with next pay period’s money.

https://www.youneedabudget.com/are-you-riding-the-credit-card-float/

If this describes you, you have to get off the credit card float by following the suggestions in the article.

Second, if you are in fact a paid-in-full (PIF) credit card user, then the first month that you use YNAB, you must budget *directly* to the credit card payment category, in the amount equal to the card’s existing balance.  This represents purchases made before you used YNAB, so you have to cover those purchases directly.  You only need to do this once.

After that, going forward, when you make a purchase, your credit card becomes a payment method.  You enter a transaction in your credit card account register, categorized against the relevant category, and YNAB will move money for you from that category to the credit card payment category (because you now need that money to pay off your credit card).  You cannot allow overspending to exist in your budget, because you need that money to pay off your credit card.  Address overspending when it happens, and move money around between categories to cover the overspend.

If you cannot do that, you are creating debt on the card, and you must either cover the overspend when you get paid, if it happens within the same month, or by budgeting directly to your credit card payment category if you do not get paid until the next month.  At all times, the amount available for payment and the amount of your credit card balance must be the same if you intend to be a paid in full user.

Now, you:

If you did not budget directly to your credit card payment category when you set up YNAB (because you just jumped in and didn’t read the recommended documentation or watch the suggested videos), then the money you needed to budget directly to your card is sitting down in your categories.  You need to un-budget money in those categories and budget it directly to your credit card payment category until the credit card balance and the available payment match.  You have been paying more money to your credit card company than you had available in the credit card payment category, creating overspending in the payment category, and you have to address that overspending."

After that, outside of a few special circumstances, you shouldn’t need to budget directly to the CC payments category any longer.  Just spend according to your budget, using the CC account as a payment method (like you would your checking account).

ynab,fdgm0mw,t1_fdey2vu,1578401836.0,"You can move that into YNAB.  These instructions work best/fastest on a PC, but you can do it on mobile as well.

First, rename your categories.  Change it from “Cable Bill” to “5th Comcast $95”. Now you can see, at a glance, when it will be due (the 5th), who it will be paid to, and how much it will be (rounded).  If it’s not a monthly bill, for instance, it’s the yearly YNAB renewal, then I do “DEC YNAB Renewal $45.”  Weekly spending is something like “Groceries $400”.

Next, go to your account register that you use to pay the cable bill, and set up a transaction that will recur monthly on the 5th in the amount for the bill.  When you go back to the budget screen, the bubble for that category will be green if you put enough money there to pay the bill, yellow if you need to put money there, and gray once the transaction has happened for the month.  Now you can see if that category needs attention from you.  For the things that do not recur on a monthly schedule, set up goals, either monthly spending goals, or target amount by date goals.  These, also, will now have colored bubbles that show you whether or not they need money.

Lastly, ditch YNAB’s master categories and create time based ones instead.  I use “weekly spending” that holds things like gas for the cars, grocery money, money for dining out, household purchases, etc.  Then I have “monthly bills,” “quarterly bills,” and “yearly bills.”  These things get arranged by date.  All my monthly, recurring bills, in one place, in order by date.  I also have “Other expenses” for our sinking funds like anniversary gifts, birthdays, auto maintenance, vet expenses, and so forth.

Okay, you now have your budget template set up (https://www.youneedabudget.com/how-to-create-a-budget-template/), and now you can literally budget all your categories in just a few clicks.  My husband gets paid on the 15th and last day of the month.  I get paid every two weeks, so in some months we have money coming in every week, and in other months things sync up.  Doesn’t matter.  When a paycheck comes in, I start with the bills and I budget everything on PC so I can see the inspector window on the right hand side of the screen.  Click the checkbox next to the bills that are due before we get paid again.  In the inspector window, a running total starts called “underfunded.”  That number is calculated either by the amount of the recurring transaction you set up, or the goal you set up, for the categories that you have checked.

Keep checking off categories (starting with bills, then moving to weekly spending, then to longer term saving and spending categories) until the “underfunded” number meets (but does not exceed) the amount of the income in TBB you have to budget for that pay period.  Then click the underfunded button, and YNAB will budget the money to the categories you have clicked."

We also hold our money divided between two banks:  our checking and saving accounts at one bank, and a high yield saving account at a second bank.  

Our “emergency fund” category only has $2K in it.  Our approach is that it’s intended to cover the “oh shit this just happened” expense that needs to be paid for right now and can’t wait the 3-5 days for money to transfer over from our high-yield savings account.

We decided that it made more sense to have 3-6 months of expenses in a category called “income replacement” rather than emergency, because that is what it really is.  It’s the income replacement if one of us loses a job.

You have to be a grown up and make responsible decisions, and depending on your income, that can mean various things, but for most people, it means letting the money sit and not buying random shit.

Before I spend money, I look into the category to see if the money is there.  If it’s not, I don’t buy the thing.  It’s that simple.  If I have $2500 in checking today, but my mortgage is coming out in 3 days and it’s $2000, then no matter how badly I want to drop $1K on something, I can’t do it.  I have to pay my mortgage.

That same spending decision can be extrapolated out over any timescale you like, and for any amount you like.  **It does not matter how much money I have in my checking account right now, I’m still not spending more than $400 at the grocery store this month.** Period, full stop.

ynab,fcl61bi,t1_fckebyl,1577740573.0,">Do you not look at all of your account balances and see the money in them all?

No, you look at your *category* available balance.

You need to learn a very important skill here, and that’s letting money sit.  My grocery category has $400 available in it right now.  If I go to the grocery store, it does not matter to me even a little bit how much is in my checking account, total, because only $400 of that is set aside for buying groceries.  The rest of the money in my checking account has other jobs.  Some of those jobs are the mortgage bill, gas for the cars, money for dog food, and all the other bills that come out before we get paid again.  Some of those jobs are for long term savings, like the annual bills that come due in January.  So, I know that $400 is all I have for groceries, and it has to last me the whole month.  *Everything else in the checking account has another job already, and that money has to sit there until I need it.*"

HealthyFood,fcizem3,t3_ehe0sl,1577673489.0,"Step one: find a lettuce that you like. Lettuce is literally just plant leaves, and different lettuces taste differently AND crunch differently. Arugula can be kind of peppery, and iceberg is a little bitter. Whatever you buy, wash it thoroughly and then dry. I aim for 40-50 grams of lettuce per salad, and that nearly fills my bowl. 

Step two: add vegetables. Literally anything goes here. I generally always like tomatoes and cucumber in any salad. You can experiment with peeling the cucumber, or even deseeding it. You can grate cucumber, too. If you like onion and peppers, add those. If not, skip them. Like broccoli? Add some in. Trader Joe’s sells this broccoli slaw that I add in liberally for crunch and volume. Fruits work well here too: try fresh blueberries and strawberries, or sprinkling on some dried cranberries. Mandarin orange slices. 

Optional: grains can be delicious in salads. Things like quinoa or bulgur should absolutely be experimented with. 

Step three: proteins and fats. All the fiber from veggies is good, but it won’t give you a long lasting feeling of satiety. Protein and fat will, but they’re calorie dense and should be added in moderation. Animal sources like chicken, or fish, or other meats if you eat those; an ounce of shredded cheese. If you are veggie based, look at beans, nuts, and avocado as well as the numerous soy options. 

Step four: dressings. These DO NOT have to be a calorie bomb! You can add several tablespoons of salsa to a salad to give it a southwestern taste for next to no calories. A basic vinaigrette (1 tablespoon each of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and lemon juice) packs a hell of a lot of flavor for less than 150 calories. Tatziki is so good and really versatile and adds more plants to your salad. 

Southwest Salad
50g of lettuce
75g of sweet corn
85g of black beans
100g of tomatoes
125g of diced cucumber
60g of avocado 
100g of meat (optional)
30g of sour cream
120g of salsa
(Onions and bell peppers if you like those; I don’t.)

Basic Breakfast Salad
50g of lettuce
125g of cucumber 
100g of tomato
75g of blueberries 
65g of avocado
2 large eggs, fried in 14g melted butter
1T olive oil

I attributed that to normal hair cycles, but after I stopped using the LUS products, the itchy ness went away, so now I’m not so sure that my hair maybe just didn’t like their products.

news,fcajj94,t1_fcagfq3,1577570399.0,"I like science, so let’s talk to the CDC:

>*Can nasal spray flu vaccine give me influenza?*
>Influenza vaccines do not cause influenza illness. The nasal spray influenza vaccine does contain live viruses. However, the viruses are attenuated (weakened), so that they will not cause influenza illness. The weakened viruses are also cold-adapted, which means they are designed to only multiply at the cooler temperatures found within the nose. The viruses cannot infect the lungs or other areas where warmer temperatures exist.

>While an influenza vaccine cannot give you influenza illness, there are different side effects that may be associated with getting an influenza shot or a nasal spray influenza vaccine.

>These side effects are mild and short-lasting, especially when compared to symptoms of bad case of influenza.

>* Can a flu vaccine give you the flu?*

>No, flu vaccines cannot cause flu illness. Flu vaccines given with a needle (i.e., flu shots) are currently made in two ways: the vaccine is made either with a) flu viruses that have been ‘inactivated’ (killed) and that therefore are not infectious, or b) using only a single gene from a flu virus (as opposed to the full virus) in order to produce an immune response without causing infection. This is the case for  recombinant influenza vaccines.

fatlogic,fcad1bx,t3_egrqt2,1577567072.0,"I’m doing really, really well with tracking my intake and staying either under my goal, or within say 50 calories of it most days.

Then there’s Tuesday.

Tuesday night is game night.  I have tried every strategy I know to stay out of the fucking candy bowl.  I bring my own dinner to the table.  I bring “snacks” type dinners (cheese cubes, pita cut into wedges, hummus, grape tomatoes, sausage bites) to see if the problem is just that I want to munch on things while we game.  I’ve brought grapes in case it was a sugar craving.  I’ve tried timing my dinner (eat this food at this time, then wait and an hour later eat that food) to see if that would help.

I still can’t resist the candy bowl.

So, starting this Tuesday, I’m going to be a grownup and just put a rule in place that I don’t eat at the D&D table.  Full stop.  I will take my flavored seltzer, I will eat my dinner before I go, and that’s just the end of it.

I can manage to restrain myself every other night of the week, so I can do it on Tuesdays too."

You can get vaccinated and still get the flu afterwards.  There are multiple flu strains, and the yearly vaccination only covers the strains predicted to be most likely to circulate that year, and some years we guess wrong.  Some people don’t respond to the vaccine, although the number of non-responders is extremely tiny; we’re talking fractions of a percent.

Some people experience mild, flu-like symptoms after getting the vaccine.  That is not the flu. 

Some people get a bad cold and think they have the flu.  Influenza is NOT a cold, and even bad colds are not the flu.

But the vaccine?  No, it cannot give you the flu.  It is deliberately engineered in such a way that it cannot give you the flu."
