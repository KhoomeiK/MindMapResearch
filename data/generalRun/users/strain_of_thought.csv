todayilearned,fflzb4h,t1_fflgu2l,1580046024.0,"Chemically speaking, all so called ""milks"" are emulsions of fat in water, regardless of their origin. That's why they share a visual, gustatory, and textural resemblance. Plant-based milks are just using plant fats instead of animal fats. Sometimes this occurs naturally, such as in coconut milk, and sometimes the emulsion is artificially prepared by humans, such as in soy milk. Mammals are animals that evolved to excrete such emulsions (from modified sweat glands) in order to provide food for their young. Monotremes (like the platypus) don't even have nipples and just sweat the fat-emulsion straight out of their skin on their undersides. There's evidence that milk excretion evolved as a way for our reptile-like synapsid ancestors to keep their leathery eggs moist in the nest by sweating on them, and that over time it gradually became a means of providing primary nourishment to young as synapsids moved to giving live birth."

The difference is you don't have actual direct exposure to Japan to recognize in what ways Anime is culturally unrealistic, but when you watch media from western artists you can separate intuitively in what ways the characters are behaving better than real western people actually do.

Ericsson had to be begged by one of Lincoln's advisors to design the Monitor, as he had sworn off ever having anything to do with the U.S. Navy ever again, but his expertise was sought because many believed his genius was the only thing which could answer the Confederacy's head start on ironclad technology."
