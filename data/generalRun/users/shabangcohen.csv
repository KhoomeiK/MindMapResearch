Fitness,ffnok61,t1_ffnks0j,1580068593.0,"Yeah honestly not saying any of those steps are wrong, just that people take on too much too fast and then end up dropping the good habits because it becomes unsustainable."
Fitness,ffnhjpi,t3_etj0mj,1580066073.0,"I don't really understand why a 'fat' person goes straight to precise calorie tracking, heart rate tracking, strict workouts that leave you feeling super drained. I think that's a recipe for burnout and relapsing into old habits.   


We focus so much on complicated methods that make us feel like we have control instead of the 20% things that give 80% of the results. Like, if you're legitimately overweight why would you need to make a specific effort to up your protein intake? You probably get plenty of protein, even in a calorie deficit.

 I think it's really rare for someone to go from not watching what they eat at all to tracking everything consistently and making 'perfect' choices overnight. People wake up on Jan 1st thinking they transformed from a couch potato to someone who drinks green smoothies and lifts 3 times a week etc. When really, they would be much better off going on easy walks and skipping their morning bagel/dessert a few times a week.   


Not saying that's you necessarily, but feeling nauseous and wobbly and unable to walk after every single workout sounds dangerous and unsustainable imo. You're trying to make a few big changes all at once... I would suggest taking it slow."

cscareerquestions,fewpskn,t1_fetzwa9,1579417674.0,"Yup pretty much. And as someone with this background, no one making 100k actually thinks they're legitimately struggling. They just see others making more at the same age and start thinking what they have isn't enough.   


It seems like it's mostly people who have never been to the bay who believe it's hard to live on a normal tech salary."
fatlogic,fds15o0,t3_eltodu,1578692700.0,"I hate it when people make false analogies. It's so common on the internet. Such a huge pet peeve.  


Why should I compare obesity to long hair? Fat is literally not hair."
fatlogic,fds0vt4,t3_el0r5y,1578692531.0,"I don't think whole30 is harmful...  
But being extremely restricting (especially when you try to go to that from an unhealthy diet overnight) can be harmful psychologically.  


And it does seem really inappropriate to ask coworkers to help you lose weight and talking about their diet. It sounds super attention seeking and seeking validation before the fact.  
Even as a normal-weight person I would hate going to grab a cookie at work and having someone tell me about how they can't eat one."
fatlogic,fds016l,t3_ejyo7h,1578692227.0,"Are you suggesting that this post is wrong?   


Because to me it's pretty obvious that by 'eating adequately forever' they mean to eat a sustainable healthy diet rather than crash diet and end up yo-yoing.   


I don't know the context of this person's other posts, but to me this is not fat logic at all."
fatlogic,fdrycgp,t3_ekgr6e,1578691539.0,"I think 70% of the reason I work out is for health, mood, because it's fun etc.   


And then there are definitely the reasons such as looking better and getting more attention etc. Yeah, maybe this year I do want to work out harder in order to have abs this summer and feel confident in a swimsuit. And really even the goal of looking good is based in challenging myself and building discipline. And proving that my parents' obesity and health problems don't make me destined for the same.

But so what if I care about looking a certain way? We live in a reality where we have eyes and physical bodies and why should we ignore that?  


Actually I am afraid of being fat because I've seen the social and physical implications. But as long as I treat others kindly regardless of their weight, my motivations and habits (as long as they're healthy) are nobody's business"
fatlogic,fdrw3h7,t3_eky3cu,1578690637.0,"A very powerful and well-spoken message. I guess I'm too young to have watched that show, I just recognize her from seeing ads and maybe a couple clips. But she sounds much smarter than I assumed.   


The fact that the show turned into a fat-shaming spectacle isn't the trainers' fault, it's the marketing/coverage around it and the reality TV machine."
cscareerquestions,fdmiwh7,t3_elwrzj,1578551542.0,"I've even interviewed for companies like google/facebook around March for an internship position, so definitely not.

cscareerquestions,fctlhf3,t1_fcp9xqt,1577947712.0,"OP seems to be single (maybe I'm just assuming). Which I think changes the situation a lot, since they don't live with someone that they spend a lot of time with and probably aren't meeting potential partners sitting at home coding.   


I'm really sure how anything I said related to being the life of the party or pair programming, though. The problem is sitting alone with headphones coding most of the day and then going home and sitting alone with headphones coding.   


Clearly op does see a need to more social stimulation, otherwise they wouldn't be posting about their fear of becoming anti-social."
cscareerquestions,fctl7xi,t1_fcpe7ds,1577947395.0,"I agree with that statement and personally I love spending time alone value it a lot, especially when I spend that time doing 'productive' things such as reading/exercise/pursuing other interests. But there's a big difference between spending a couple hours a day or a couple nights a week doing that, versus spending most nights for years on end on your own in front of the computer. Everything in moderation."
cscareerquestions,fcp3wyw,t3_eibm6q,1577849694.0,"A lot of commenters here acting like limited social interaction is a good thing but I think it's a huge problem. Loneliness is a killer.   


Do you think you don't hang out with people because you enjoy coding and learning on your own more? Or do you spend time coding and learning alone because you don't have many friends/don't like your friend group/ don't have confidence and feel awkward in social situations?   


Personally I think people become workaholics because they lack a social life/other interests, not the other way around.   


I think you should get a hobby that's social and completely unrelated to tech. And do things like working out to improve confidence, go up to talk to randos at events and reach out to people you know to meet up for coffee/drinks even if it seems awkward to do so at first."
LiveFromNewYork,fco12aj,t3_dox49o,1577822169.0,"Yeah I think he's a good writer, not a very good performer tbh. At least not for snl, he pretty much can only play one character. Which works for very specific things, but usually it doesn't.   


He also sometimes sticks his arms straight out and moves up and down them through the duration of entire lines... To me it doesn't look like an artistic choice, but almost like he's self-soothing because he's nervous and trying to like, talk in the right cadence?"
cscareerquestions,fcln5wf,t1_fcixudx,1577751720.0,"Opposite of my experience honestly. I always wanted to try out different sports, art, clubs etc to explore my interests but my parents would instead sign me up for shit like extra math courses or an online essay writing class lol. Or told me that doing things outside of school wouldn't give me enough time for homework. Same shit though, making your kids do things they don't like instead of figuring out what they do."
cscareerquestions,fclmfnu,t1_fci2yp7,1577751222.0,"I'm surprised to hear that about your parents honestly, most of my American/white friends' parents were pretty hands off but the predominant grade-obsessed culture did seep into their psyches as well. My parents are white but my mom grew up in Eastern Europe and her tactics of choice were definitely comparing me to other people and negative talk about anyone who doesn't follow the path of straight A's-> prestigious college w/ STEM degree -> master's or job at a big corporation. 

She herself said she doesn't like the career her parents pushed her into, yet turns around and tries to do the exact same thing to me. Parents don't even realize when they're repeating the same fucked up habits."
cscareerquestions,fcllhil,t3_ehk3q6,1577750572.0,"First of all, either cal or the company are pretty likely to let you move your start date by a year.   
I think you should stay at cal, free tuition makes it worth it and berkeley is way more fun than palo alto.   


Also, you want to explore somewhere outside of the bay but think arlington might be your only opportunity to do so? And you'd be graduating from a top school with an advanced degree in the most lucrative major, yet you're already worrying about a recession that may or may not happen. That's such a narrow way to look at the world.   


You're young and clearly smart and are going to have so many opportunities for fancy jobs either here or abroad, and if you can get into a good master's program now you could also get into one in two years, or five. Nothing you choose is going to make or break your career, that's just unnecessary economic anxiety thanks to growing up in palo alto. It does seem like what you really wanna do is stay in cal, so that's what you should do imo."

cscareerquestions,fchpuwt,t1_fcfk0gj,1577652841.0,"I'm 24 and as a product of the mentality you describe, I agree 100%. My friends whose parents implemented the curiosity and confidence strategy not only grew up happier, they're doing just as well if not better in their careers.   


Teaching kids to value grades and activities that 'look good' for college over learning and their actual interests doesn't actually seem to make them work harder. It just makes them feel the need to make it look like they're working harder. Instead of teaching them proper work/life balance and time management, it reinforces the idea that any time not spent working/studying is wasted. But since that's unsustainable they just feel guilty for taking time off, or the only 'downtime' they allow themselves is internet surfing that they can hide and do in isolation. 

&#x200B;

And this economic/academic anxiety definitely has serious consequences. Somehow palo alto is known as a mecca of innovation and prosperity, but also as one of the teen suicide capitals of the country."
cscareerquestions,fc44qan,t1_fc2emsq,1577406586.0,"You also don't necessarily get any more money if you work extra or work on a project that brings in a lot of revenue, and you often talk to people so little that you feel like you're in social isolation. No entrepreunershup can be seen as not using a lot of creativity, and sitting at a desk all day can also make you lethargic and according to some studies, die sooner.   


Not saying it's a bad gig, but your list of pros shows a clear bias as well."
