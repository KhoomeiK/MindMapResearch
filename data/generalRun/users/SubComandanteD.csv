CLG,ff7j1hf,t1_ff2trgc,1579650703.0,depends on the country you are coming from but the reason why a lot of orgs are having issues right now with visas in the US is because the Donald has changed some stuff on how immigration is handled administratively that has lead to a bunch of backups all visas are taking longer now a days.
politics,ff7ip36,t1_ff6w7rb,1579650469.0,System is working as intended then. There are literal passages of texts in socialist pamphlets that say the exact same thing you are saying from like a hundred years ago.

worldnews,feza6ok,t3_eqw3ea,1579455253.0,While some of this might be true in terms of what they are doing with surveillance of people in china I can't help but feel like this is just another propaganda piece so people get even more scared of china to drive us to another fucking war.
ABoringDystopia,feou379,t1_feortke,1579305538.0,Its true tho the reason we can't get together in the US is in large part because of racism from working class and middle class whites. Not talking about it is not going to get us anywhere AND the right thing to do is NOT for black/brown people to ignore it in the name of 'unity' the right thing to do is for racist whites to stop being racist so we can actually unite.

politics,fdmp164,t1_fdlolby,1578558787.0,It wouldn't because its not true. Capitalist economies experience a downturn on average every 7 years regardless of where in the world and the time period downturns are inherent to the capitalist system.
politics,fdlifla,t1_fdkqna0,1578524713.0,Also that legal immigrants tend to be from at least the middle class often higher in their own countries which makes them also more likely to be white (yes white people are also more likely to be well off in Latin America too who would have thought! Lol)
politics,fdlhilv,t1_fdklu3z,1578524140.0,No one should but because the way things are black and brown people often have to be 'proud' in a sense of their skin as society in general puts out very strong vibes that black and brown skin is bad and ugly so you have be explicitly proud and celebrate your skin to repair the damage of all those years of bad vibes. White people don't have this problem right? So that's why white pride is not associated with anything but white supremacy. Its all around unfortunate tbh but as long as we live in a racist society things are gonna probably be this way.
politics,fdlfq5q,t1_fdlcliw,1578523043.0,Is this even true anymore? Americans life expectancy went down last year. One of the only reasons that poverty is going down globally is because china is doing so well too and almost every capitalist developing country is doing pretty much the same as 10 years ago. Idk bro seems to me like the wheels are coming off and you just know there's an economic downturn around the corner.
politics,fdlevs2,t1_fdlan5v,1578522529.0,Yeah leading us straight into a climate catastrophe lol
politics,fdleqqj,t1_fdlavyl,1578522445.0,I see that you are well meaning so all I will say to you is that you need to read up on what capitalism and socialism actually are and how they work. Also make sure to read what capitalism and socialism are from a socialist/communist/anarchist perspective aka from their own mouths as capitalist sources are filled to the brim with propaganda from the cold war (not to say avoid them completely but in general you'll have to read Marx engels Lenin etc or at least summaries of them to understand what communism and socialism actually are)

news,fdfe324,t1_fdf50xe,1578359533.0,I guess what you see as mere incompetence I see as 100's of years of deliberate oppression of black people in the US it is no coincidence that black people happen to get the short end of the stick when it comes to policy every single time. I guess it is telling what things I see as a measure of racism (systematic oppression by the government) and what you seem to see as the real measure (wether or not you want to live next to a different race aka what the survey you posted asks)

worldnews,fdf2oiq,t1_fdeu9ib,1578351933.0,They are saying fuck America I didn't dispute that but death to america has connotations of 'them' wanting to kill all 'us' which is untrue they just hate our government (which is totally fair imo they do heinous shit to other countries.)

MurderedByWords,fda8qcu,t1_fda6wyx,1578243087.0,"Unfortunately its also white women the real leaders of the right are the wealthy and white and their supporters are the general working whites (most white people vote Republican right now if I'm not mistaken) because in the US the rich whites basically have a pact with working class whites for them to get more ""privileges"" than the brown people. Its wack cus we'd could all get a much better deal if we banded together among class so that all the working class could have actual political power instead of being fractured and being fucked by the rich."

politics,fcyl4dq,t1_fcyk3xt,1578081998.0,what perception exactly? The dominant perception of politics is that of the capitalist thought aka liberalism so I don't see how there was a false perception created for the 'masses' as what the masses believe right now is capitalist ideology. Marxist conception of history aka dialectical materialism is not Hegelian even though it stems from Hegel but he was an idealist not a materialist. In any sense you don't really say why its flawed.
