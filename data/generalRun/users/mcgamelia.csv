conspiracy,ffijzc3,t3_ettazx,1579975685.0,"I think we’ve got to remember that a celebrity’s life is very different to ours. I’m not saying their life is any easier or harder, but they must feel like they’re leading an incredibly false, superficial and, most crucially, inescapable life. If you can’t just get another job or another wife or another city without being ubiquitously recognised, it might seem the only way out to kill yourself. They also have the access and the level of dissociation from reality that most don’t. 

That being said, I think fake-suicides are basically common knowledge now. Even the most ignorant of people have their theories on who got assassinated by who, even if they’re just bullshit ones that have trickled down into their ears with little to no jurisdiction. People like Epstein, Cobain, Monroe etc are basically regarded as murder victims by the general public. It’s entirely lucid.

Edit: I also think re: hanging as the preferred method, that probably has something to do with the ease of it and the rather vain but understandable fact that it doesn’t completely fuck up your appearance. It’s also relatively fast and efficient and (though I have no idea) painless? Idk"
vegan,ffht4ip,t3_etnyle,1579952551.0,"I’m vegan and plant based, as I don’t believe they’re the same thing. I have the ethical reasons just as I do the health reasons, and both mean a lot to me and dictate the way I eat and live as a consumer. 

I get what you’re saying about not wanting to admit to being vegan. There’s absolutely nothing to be ashamed about if you are vegan, but I understand the fear of people being rude/embarrassing/distant to you because of it. I think our reluctance to outright identify as vegan with absolute pride is something that will change over time, as we become more confident and used to it. I’ve been vegan for six ish months and I know how frustrating it is to have omnis constantly gate keeping you as though they’re more entitled to tell you how to be vegan."

PlantBasedDiet,ffc9iti,t3_esurs0,1579794613.0,"Weight, the number you see on the scale, is entirely controlled by your caloric intake. Obviously water weight exists and is impacted by things like sugar, salt, white carbs etc., but your ‘true’ weight corresponds with the energy you eat. 

Your body composition depends on what you eat, exercise and genetics. For example if two women of the same height and starting weight both ate 1800 calories a day, one eating sugary junk food and the other wfpb, they’d look quite differently but weigh the same.

And good fats are great!! They’re high calorie but that’s only an ‘issue’ if you’re eating more calories because of them. If you’re eating the same calorie count, which sounds like it’s a maintaining number but I don’t know, then it’s not going to affect the number on the scale. 

The only way to lose weight is to eat in a deficit.

I’d just say try your best wherever possible, cook from home when you can (but don’t deprive yourself from experiencing another culture!), and most importantly, download happy cow so you can use it to find vegan-accommodating eateries whenever you want. being a city, I know paris has many strictly vegan places and even more places have options. france is a traditionally stubborn and old fashioned country and you’d probably struggle in more rural areas, but cities are always more progressive and inclusive. have fun!!!

I don’t know a whole lot about Trump but I do know that he was a prominent celebrity-ish businessman during the time American Psycho was set. His life was all parties and big tits and making filthy amounts of money: he’s the exact personification of the man Patrick Bateman wanted to be. Whether or not he was good at his job is irrelevant, just like Bateman’s job is essentially meaningless in his life."

DebateAVegan,fesxydd,t3_eqj0zd,1579370070.0,"I’d say that the immediate and obvious answer to this is a vehement ‘no’. If the meat and dairy industries are twins, then the leather industry is the little brother who’s also a piece of shit. 

HOWEVER as someone who is not just conscious of the welfare of animals but also of other humans and planet earth itself, I think it’s ignorant to gloss over how awful fake leather can be. It’s non-biodegradable, leaks toxic chemicals, and exploits poor people who are underpaid for their labour and then exposed to the toxicity, just as many animals and fish are. 

My solution is polemic, but I say that if you have to buy a leather product, fake or not, I’d always say secondhand. Secondhand leather tends to be better quality than secondhand fake leather and thus you’re then buying less and supporting smaller business rather than big corporations. I can’t imagine that it’s all that bad to buy the leather of a cow that’s been dead for like thirty years off a small independent seller, you know what I mean?

Fur is harder because it’s not even a byproduct of anything. Even omnis think firsthand fur is revolting and should be banned, so clearly I agree. Secondhand.... I guess? Same logic as leather: it’s not going anywhere and you’re not supporting the industry so why not? Fake fur is pretty shitty too. First world problems. 

And then there’s the issue of investment pieces and designer stuff, where a Bottega Veneta leather bag will last infinitely longer than a plastic  bullshit leather purse from H&M and is ultimately more sustainable and anti-capitalist in the long term, if it’s a one-time investment purchase. But a secondhand Bottega Veneta bag off Vestiaire/eBay/theRealReal? The best. Cheap leather is objectively awful from all angles, btw. 

TLDR secondhand leather is better than firsthand fake leather (unless you’re getting that super sustainable stuff, in which case, they’re equalish). According to my opinion, at least. 

Anyone that is flippant about leather isn’t a vegan, they’re just plant based."
