I rent a lot of cars because I travel for work, and the all touch screen is usually a pain in the ass. 

The trouble is, the car companies that have decided to shift to it completely (Jeep, Dodge), even on their lower end models, are still trying to make a profit. So what you end up with is cheap screens that aren't very receptive and generally feel poor quality compared to the phones we all have in our pockets."

Not ADHD, or really this diagram, but I've found that they emphasize the wrong part of the story. It's clearly unintentional, but what they focus the telling about is not actually pertinent to the tale.

For instance it may be a story about how the cat got stuck in the tree or something. The climax of the story is how a guy climbed 60ft up a tree at night with a chainsaw to clear a path, and finally nabbed the cat by the scruff if its neck. Pretty good story! 

But the older person may breeze over that, and focus on how they called and called the cat wouldn't come, and it's so strange because usually the cat comes right away, especially when it's dinner time, and I was starting to get worried that I hadn't seen the cat all day..."

Many cities were hit pretty hard in the 70s and 80s, and major investment didn't really kick into high gear until the mid 90s. 

So growing up in the 90s, near a small/medium city, downtown was like our personally paradise! Not too beat up anymore to be worried about it, but still a little rough around the edges, with places to explore and discover right in your own back yard!

But growth and gentrification continues, since it never seems to sit still. And pretty soon everyone, EVERYONE was there, and that's where we are today. 

Yeah, I'm happy for the prosperity, and the business, and the better reputation. But miss that old gleam too, the kind you had to look for to find.
