childfree,ffhxmep,t3_etq0t3,1579958346.0,That sucks... Enjoy your day off though. Maybe. Now you will have some leverage over the doctors to give you a salp. Best of luck x
2007scape,ffhwi2u,t3_etpwxm,1579957040.0,"That only makes me feel that osrs is cringe worthy. Which is a shame, because I love osrs."

todayilearned,ffbyn23,t1_ffby30q,1579786915.0,And yet I fear all of them
2007scape,ffbvv4u,t1_ffbvlp7,1579784490.0,Maybe we should all start botting next and share tips publicly. Maybe they will adress the problem then.
2007scape,ffbuvu3,t3_esrt65,1579783565.0,The chocking part is not that it happened. It's that Jagex got off their butts and intervened.
MakeupAddiction,ffbumwg,t3_esrrwv,1579783322.0,The eyeshadow is beautifully blended and shaped for your eye shape! Great look. Since there is glitter I wouldn't do much else. Maybe a gloss depending on your mood.
2007scape,ffbu9bw,t3_esrw80,1579782945.0,Has Jagex stepped in? In that case I am genuinely shocked.
CongratsLikeImFive,ffbr6dk,t3_espyne,1579779492.0,That's great! You also just motivated me to do a small dance session for cardio during my break. Thanks op!
weddingplanning,ffbozzo,t3_esolsy,1579776494.0,"Tell them that they need to tell you what they are willing to eat and you can check with the chef. A children's menu maybe. 

This seems important to you, so I'll indulge it but personally I wouldn't cater to them. What they are asking is pretty childish imo. If checking with the chef fails I'd tell them what is being served and ask them to plan accordingly. They can look up near by restaurants on the web."
2007scape,ffboo9f,t1_ffa1afm,1579776013.0,"They need to stop excusing their lack of upkeep on lack of personnel or being ""busy"". Considering how old this game is we are paying a fortune for it."
todayilearned,ffbj52a,t3_esnd7z,1579767733.0,Since my mosquito bites swell up to the size of a fist this stunt would really piss me off.
weddingplanning,ff8nwci,t3_es7j0o,1579688044.0,"I'd recommend getting it done too. Remember: you're the bride! Don't pinch the budget too hard on things for yourself. This is you and your husband's day. Maybe you can save the money elsewhere? 

Also just let the MUA know that you prefer putting mascara on yourself. I think it's a normal thing to prefer to do it yourself."
SantasLittleHelpers,ff5m745,t1_ff5m1t7,1579599794.0,Don't even respond to that hate any further OP. I'm familiar with Gabriel Iglesias joke and this is hilarious. Don't even worry :)
AskReddit,ff2a3it,t1_ff238vi,1579498331.0,Thanks for the tip. Even if it sucks that it's even a thing
PoliticalHumor,ff28rx5,t3_er31hn,1579497136.0,I'm getting paid for studying at my free university. As are all of my classmates. Gl on the elections guys.
weddingplanning,femtjgk,t1_femt3hl,1579269189.0,This looks amazing regardless of hair length!
freefolk,femswvy,t3_epuchj,1579268682.0,I hate their writing and arrogance so much. I hope they saved some money from GoT though. At this pace they will need it.
childfree,femeqtu,t3_epvsya,1579251672.0,"Wow it seems like shit hit the fan here. What happened? I just came to say congratulations on taking your power back and making the right choice for you. Of course you are worth bodily autonomy like every other person. I hope you recover well, if you haven't already x"
2007scape,fem9gkv,t1_fem7yh6,1579244716.0,It says twisted league rewards in the title dude.
2007scape,fem6j7n,t1_felx49y,1579241513.0,I was underlining the problem especially for one above the other. Doesn't mean the post was only about them. Sorry you misunderstood.
2007scape,fem6f9s,t1_felzdoc,1579241401.0,I didn't mean to exclude the throphies in my post. The trophies are actually the worst part imo :)
PoliticalHumor,felyyue,t1_felmbu4,1579234563.0,Honestly the TV series will just feel like bad writing. Real life feels like bad writing at this point
freefolk,felyrxj,t3_epsf7b,1579234411.0,To be fair I liked this scene more than her sex scene /s
2007scape,felwuw7,t1_felwlyf,1579232951.0,I was actually considering the trophies cosmetics in my post. Maybe that could have been made clearer
MakeupAddiction,feltulm,t3_eptx05,1579230792.0,We don't roast. You look fantastic :)
CasualConversation,feltp7i,t3_epszmc,1579230686.0,I'm glad you found something you like! Stick to it :) Also nobody will smell your hair close enough to notice. And even if they do it'd be super creepy if they pointed it out! And inappropriate because it truly does not matter.
weddingplanning,felthxk,t3_epqrqz,1579230542.0,It's beautiful. A veil could be nice depending on your preferences. I'd o ly use jewelry on hands and/or wrists with this dress though :)
MakeupAddiction,felteam,t3_eppcnm,1579230470.0,Looks great! It's honestly the first time I've liked a pink look and I've seen a lot of them. They're hard to pull off!
2007scape,felt3oy,t1_felrqzm,1579230262.0,Thanks for finding that man. I appreciate it
2007scape,felr61d,t1_felqmon,1579228930.0,I'm just missing the point of entering the rewards into main rs so players can cash in on them since other things from twisted league can't be transferred for the same reason
2007scape,felqy5i,t1_felqk0d,1579228781.0,Are you sure they will be available again? I could easily imagine Jagex making new cosmetic rewards each year to keep players interested.
Converse,felqosc,t1_felq9zl,1579228602.0,I came to say the opposite thing lol. I'm so glad we're able to help op out
OopsDidntMeanTo,felqey4,t1_felebg2,1579228414.0,"Maybe op is just from Europe. We use ""military time"" too and actually consist of more people than the USA."
2007scape,felq6f2,t1_felpw0z,1579228251.0,"Because it's just another party hat situation like in rs3. It also seems unnecessary considering they reward everyone all the old holiday rewards etc on osrs too without the players having to make an effort to get them. Why should twisted league be any different?

They could award the cosmetic rewards for twisted league so players can use it there next season instead."
2007scape,felpzqi,t1_felpsdv,1579228121.0,Aw shit. I missed it then.
childfree,felpyhl,t1_fele2p2,1579228096.0,Imagine travelling cross country in order to pay for getting to do a shit job. Lol. I hopefully your mom likes kids. A lot. And has more vacation than 2 weeks a year x
OopsDidntMeanTo,felo9hd,t3_epmsim,1579226927.0,To be fair I think she is right
todayilearned,fela3r5,t1_fel27uv,1579217384.0,"What reasons? If they medically can't, then that's up for the doctors to decide. Once they are dead. If they can't do it because of religion then honestly they probably shouldn't accept donations either."
todayilearned,fel9v9i,t3_eppa70,1579217232.0,As it should be. I am a donor and dreading the thought of dying on the wait list while non-donors get organs ahead of me.
Oldschool_Runescape,fel0f1y,t3_eppvgs,1579211387.0,There was a really helpful thread in here about 24 hours ago on the same topic with loads of different advice depending on your preferred way to play the game
2007scape,fekd4db,t3_epjcyy,1579197542.0,Is that from twisted league?
