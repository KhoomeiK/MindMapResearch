depression,ffpya7g,t3_eueohu,1580110708.0,"I think a better way of putting it is that we’re wounded. A veteran who’s missing a leg has clearly been through some serious shit, but now he needs help doing basic things."
depression,ffpxsgn,t3_eqs4h8,1580110068.0,Yes but by killing yourself you also eliminate the chances of having a miserable life. It all comes down to “is this risk worth it?”
ForeverAloneDating,ff5g0p0,t3_eqpswd,1579591247.0,"Don’t know how this showed up on my feed, but maybe it’s a sign. I might shoot my shot here. I’ve been super depressed and lonely lately and don’t have much left to lose, so it probably won’t do any harm."
SuicideWatch,ff5fq51,t1_ff5f9sz,1579590886.0,Or chances to get worse. Living is a gamble that not everyone is willing to take.
SuicideWatch,ff5fn8l,t1_ff5eyln,1579590785.0,Mental illness is basically a brain parasite.
depression,ff5eykp,t1_ff0tn50,1579589973.0,"We just get built up to be knocked down. Someone else said that depression and anxiety are the most painful mental disorders because we are aware of reality and that we’re broken, and that seems right to me. It’s burdensome knowledge."
depression,ff5etvv,t1_ff121vf,1579589824.0,I’ve been on meds for over three years as well. Nothing lasting. Some people have no hope.
SuicideWatch,ff5ernf,t1_ff1bupz,1579589751.0,"It’s influenced by external things sometimes, but you’re right. Mainly, it’s invisible to everyone."
SuicideWatch,ff5emwi,t1_ff5e5bq,1579589602.0,Translation: We want you to suffer x20
depression,ff5eclf,t1_ff24h73,1579589274.0,By “gets better” I meant life getting better. You’re right about the management thing because depression never goes away.
depression,ff0mbch,t1_ff08czj,1579470229.0,I stole that from a joke Internet Comment Etiquette made. Idk which video it’s from but they’re all funny so if you feel like watching something to take your mind off things they’re all good. His video on Alex Jones is one of his best IMO.
SuicideWatch,fewyz5r,t3_eqtl4w,1579421649.0,"Yeah I suppose. But if people find out that you’ve committed such a thought crime, then they’ll think you’re a threat."
SuicideWatch,fewyn9b,t1_fewyaur,1579421503.0,"I wouldn’t be sure about that. I’m in film school and I did a short video on suicide awareness. This cause someone to tell other students that I was going to shoot up the school. No one believed her luckily, but still… the stigma is insane."
SuicideWatch,fewy8vv,t3_eqnh0d,1579421327.0,That’s what I said about 2019. And 2018. And 2017…
SuicideWatch,fewxxx4,t3_eqt1wj,1579421203.0,"Very noble of you to hang on for that long for them. If you still feel the same after five years, then you’ve earned your peace."
SuicideWatch,fewxrfh,t3_eqrz77,1579421121.0,"Ironically, Hamlet’s “to be or not to be” speech actually was Hamlet considering suicide."
SuicideWatch,fewxg5t,t3_eqt07c,1579420975.0,"At one point she was ok with it. You need to communicate, friend. Talk to her again and explain how important this is for you."
depression,fewwn88,t1_fewgy0i,1579420638.0,"Are the peaks even worth it though? To me, if they aren’t, then that’s what makes someone depressed."
depression,fewwf2z,t1_fewqrfs,1579420533.0,"I first started considering suicide when I was in the first grade. Even before then I had anger issues. At one point when I was a toddler the doctors thought I might’ve had asbergers (can’t spell for shit) but ultimately ruled that wasn’t the case. So it’s most likely that it’s genetic, I’m afraid."
depression,fewvyia,t1_fewu13l,1579420339.0,You’re absolutely right on that.
SuicideWatch,fewgom8,t3_eqp6ad,1579410279.0,"I moved to a new place for college and felt better for a week or two, but soon things came back just as bad as before. Suicide is the only permanent solution."
SuicideWatch,fewfn0y,t3_eqmurw,1579409795.0,"There’s nothing wrong with being suicidal. It’s your life, your choice."
SuicideWatch,fed3ml9,t1_fec6j49,1578997151.0,This is one of the most emotionally moving posts I’ve ever seen. You have so much potential. Clearly you have a gift for the arts. I hope you stick around because I think your talents can help a lot of people. PLEASE keep in touch.
SuicideWatch,fe1avry,t1_fe06uey,1578824473.0,"I don’t know what your situation is right now, but if you can, try to find a way to live on a college campus. While living on campus for three months, I only tried to kill myself twice. It’s amazing what a new environment will do for you. And obviously, getting away for your dad is super important right now."
depression,fe19n0i,t3_enj587,1578824090.0,I should try this tbh
SuicideWatch,fe198ju,t1_fe0xwit,1578823933.0,"Probably the easiest way to commit suicide would be a cyanide pill. Unfortunately, they’re illegal for the average person to purchase."
SuicideWatch,fe18o19,t1_fe0kq2a,1578823819.0,Hi hungry I’m dad
depression,fe18dug,t3_engd6e,1578823712.0,"I had the opposite reaction. I was overjoyed that experiences that are so taboo to talk about were put on display in such a well-received film. How my friends reacted kind of bothered me though. They were shocked and thought it was extreme, when in truth Arthur’s struggles are very realistic and the violence depicted could very possibly happen and likely has happened in the past."
SuicideWatch,fc7bfnv,t3_egag8h,1577502592.0,Every living creature is enslaved. We’re just cursed with the intelligence to realize it. Lobotomize me please.
