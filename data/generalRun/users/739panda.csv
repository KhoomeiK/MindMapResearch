Christianmarriage,ffefm54,t3_estnrz,1579846150.0,"I appreciate your seriousness about marriage, and glad that you want to prevent emotions from getting in the way.

You two are still young.  Taking more time to build the financial and mental foundation would be of a higher priority.

It is just that you two are staying very close, like a couple.  You fell into sin and it wasn't healthy before.  Please put in safeguard to avoid falling again.    May you two continue to walk close to God and grow in Christ."
Christianity,ffeekjs,t3_esvyz7,1579845078.0,"I am sorry to hear that you are discouraged and not being hopeful to find a wife.  Did you just experience some set backs?

Do you have a healthy friendship circle?  Please continue to actively participate in the fellowship or small group of your church.  Also actively serve in ministries.

You think you are too unattractive.  I think you could spend more time in God's word.  This certainly would help make you more attractive because you want to stay closer with God.

You are right about the the ways to fill the sexual drive.  I've found [this article](https://bit.ly/30RdkM1) that may explain more.  But generally getting yourself close with God and focus on ministries and healthy social circles should help.  May God be with you."
Christianmarriage,ffawiyx,t3_erbn1p,1579746128.0,"I am sorry to hear about the broken of trust leading to the distance.

After getting burned, it is natural for her to want to protect herself.  She was transparent and vulnerable to trust you in the past.

It does take time for her to build the trust again.  You need to earn it now, and walk some extra miles.   Please be upfront in sharing yourself.  Be truthful and keep your promises and commitments.

Would she be open to attend a marriage conference with you?  I would like to highly recommend [this one](https://bit.ly/2sLxFWy).  With you continual pursuit of love and rekindling with her, the relationship should eventually be restored.  Please going."
Christianity,fem86e8,t3_epl3wd,1579243260.0,"Thank you very much for posting your questions and being honesty in your struggles with faith.  May God help you.

From the series of questions, I guess there is a general question about why God allow evils, and the relationship between God, Satan and His creations.

I recently heard a sermon about Job, which reminded me about Satan's relationship with God.

""One day the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came with them."" (Job 1:6)

“Very well,” the Lord told Satan, “everything he owns is in your power. However, do not lay a hand on Job himself.” So Satan left the Lord’s presence. (Job 1:12)

""One day the sons of God came again to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came with them to present himself before the Lord."" (Job 2:1)

“Very well,” the Lord told Satan, “he is in your power; only spare his life.” (Job 2:6)

Satan present himself before the Lord, while God sits on the throne.  Satan has no authority nor power except what is allowed by God.

There are reasons why God allows certain things to happen, for His purpose.  We just often do not know the reasons.

The creation is not all against God. 

Lord, our Lord, how magnificent is your name throughout the earth!

You have covered the heavens with your majesty (Psalms 8:1)

The heavens declare the glory of God, and the expanse proclaims the work of his hands. (Psalms 19:1)

We are all waiting eagerly.

For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is going to be revealed to us. For the creation eagerly waits with anticipation for God’s sons to be revealed. (Romans 8:18-19)

There should not be any doubt about the love of God for us.

For while we were still helpless, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. For rarely will someone die for a just person—though for a good person perhaps someone might even dare to die. 8 But God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:6-8)

When God so loves us, it is so natural for us to love Him back.

We love because he first loved us. (1 John 4:19)  Hope you would accept His love."
Marriage,fem4xkf,t3_epggbe,1579239898.0,"I am so sorry to hear the difficult experiences she faced.  She is very blessed to have you to care, to help and to love her. You two are truly compatible and are blessings to each other.

It is difficult for you to be out of home long and often.  It is making it difficult for your wife to build up a sense of security.  Is it possible to make arrangements to be around her and the young kids?  They all really need you.

There are many emotional baggages around your wife.  She needs to properly handle them to be restored.  Getting professional help is the most effective and maybe the only proper way.  Please continue to encourage her to see a counselor.

Christianity,fej7cu0,t3_ep7yox,1579159967.0,"To me, Christianity has two characters that are unique.

I do not know of any other religion with the lead sacrificing Himself in order to save His followers, and then return to life. And it is grace alone, because it does not depend on my works to earn my status.  I know I am totally not dependable.

There are so much that we still do not understand, because God is indeed so much higher than us.  Yet it is only because God reveals Himself that we can understand all that we need to understand.  

God is way before Abraham.  

Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am."" John 8:58

Because ""I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end."" (Revelations 22:13)

As a matter of fact, ""In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."" (Genesis 1:1)  


The bar to send to hell is actually very high, as deep as the love of God.  All that we need to do is to believe the Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins.  There is nothing we need or can do to avoid hell.

I think what you are describing about the idea of God can be explained by Paul's saying, ""14 But the person without the Spirit does not receive what comes from God’s Spirit, because it is foolishness to him; he is not able to understand it since it is evaluated spiritually. 15 The spiritual person, however, can evaluate everything"" (1 Corinthians 2:14-15a) 

Please continue to seek God and He will reveals Himself to you."
Christianity,fej5h19,t3_ep8aw7,1579157669.0,"I am so sorry to hear about your loss of mother.  You love her very much and it is so difficult to handle the emotion and that she would no longer be around.

I am also very grateful about her experiences with God, how He cares about her till the end, and be a witness to others such as your aunt.  Yes, we care about the end results or outcomes.  We also care about the experiences.  God promised that we have trials in this world.

""I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world."" (John 16:33)

So yes, God has overcome the world,, and He allowed the passing of your mother, for higher purposes.

And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. (Romans 8:28)

We may not understand why.  But you will see her again if you are a child of God.

Paul said, ""For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. (Romans 8:18)

And do not even doubt, God loves you to death.  He also love your mother even way more than you do.  He does not allows things to happen lightly.

Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. (Romans 8:26)

God suffers with you.  Hope you would understand His heart and come to Him for comfort and understanding."
TrueChristian,fdptubj,t3_emc45x,1578640240.0,I think we sin because of our sinful nature.  Stress may sometimes give us excuse to let down our guards.  We should be careful in not letting go and displeasing God.
selfimprovement,fdptgpr,t3_em8vt9,1578639816.0,"I am glad you are seeking out for help, brother.  

You are very conscientious and self-aware.  That would be good for self-protection.  You are aware of the problem, which is stopping you from pretty much doing anything.

I actually agree with you that we are so limited and have so much out of our control.  It would therefore be difficult for anyone to rely solely on themself.  If they do, they really are taking a risk on any moves.

James said in the Bible, ""Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit”— yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes.  Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.” (James 4:13-15)

 You see, we can plan all we can, but it is the Lord who helps us in anything we say or do.  So it is important that we have a relationship with Him.  We broke our relationship with God because of our wrongdoings.  All that you need to do is to confess your sins and accept Jesus who died on the cross for you.  God is for you and not against you.  Hope you can find Him soon."
