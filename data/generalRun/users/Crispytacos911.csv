KimetsuNoYaiba,ff4ilx5,t1_ff0lk40,1579564497.0,The fight could end in 10 chapters but there will be an aftermath arc that should be about another 10 chapters hopefully.  I’m guessing around 210ish

KimetsuNoYaiba,fei69q6,t1_fei61xy,1579131216.0,"No I do realize how much this will help.  Although I’m sure Muzan will still have his 2 arms left.  

Also, Muzan probably has some blood demon arts he hasn’t used yet.  He ran away from Sunbro but since he’s cornered here, he’s gonna have to continue fighting and we’ll see Muzan throughly go all out.  They still have like 1 hour 20 minutes.  That’s a lot of time."
KimetsuNoYaiba,fei5vii,t1_fei4yb2,1579130963.0,"The author doesn’t treat the pillars like fodders.  Obani will have his moment before he dies.  If she wanted to kill him off, she wouldn’t of kept him alive this long.  Obani getting the red blade is the only way they can slow Muzan down till Tanjiro comes"

KimetsuNoYaiba,fehtgmy,t1_fehtcdn,1579123535.0,He’s probably gonna die next chapter or after that.  But boy is he gonna shine before that.  Hopefully he gets all the pussy in the afterlife
KimetsuNoYaiba,feht8ya,t1_fehsor5,1579123414.0,No it’s obvious he’s about to do something big.  The author has let every pillar shine.  Obani was the only one who hasn’t gotten his moment yet.  However the ending of the last chapter shows that his about to turn his blade red and we know what that does to Muzan.  Obani May die but his death won’t come for free.
sportsbook,fehggkf,t1_feg0rx2,1579116032.0,Bet 365. It’s a 6 fight parlay.   Cerrone is 3.5 underdog and pettis is 3.0. That alone gives me a big jump

The fact that you missed Demon slayer, Vinland saga, AOT, and Dr Stone is pathetic"
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fdxku9k,t1_fdxkkan,1578769909.0,"Lol.  It’s good to know Tomura will go all out soon.  After 4 seasons, I’m kinda bored by him.  For a guy that can kill anyone by touching you, he hasn’t done much in 76 episodes.  If his arc can match this one, that’ll be great cause this arc has been my favourite in the franchise"

dogs,fdpvx2c,t1_fdpvt8v,1578642704.0,"Ya, it’s just the off chance another dog gets aggressive and provokes it.  Or if my Mom is walking It and she’s a small, weaker lady.  Just in case.  Also, I hear bullies have health issues.  Are pocket bullies healthier cause of their size? Also can you confirm that bullies have better temperaments than APBT?"
dogs,fdpv8b0,t1_fdpuod0,1578641871.0,"Thanks.  Ya their dogs seemed to be healthy but I told them they should check the health on their dogs before breeding and they did.  I told them that a lot of buyers will ask for their dogs vet history so they got that checked and it seems fine.  

I’m gonna wait a couple months before adopting so hopefully they get the dog tested.  I believe they will.  If not, I’ll scold them.  Im getting the dog for free so I might have to do some health check ups at my own expense but buyers will demand health check ups if they have to pay so I’m sure they’ll do that."

Ya but you gotta do it in their puppy stage"
BanPitBulls,fdp7ofe,t1_fdp7aiz,1578621923.0,"Ya cause there’s a lot of stray Pitbulls who probably have been abused.  

Pitbulls are one of the most commonly owned dogs.  There’s so many pure and mix Pitbull breeds.  Of course the ratio will be higher.  Pitbulls are naturally aggressive to animals outside their pack so they need to be trained out of that as a PUPPY.  

All these stories about “oh I raised my dog so well as a puppy and she’s always been good” is bullshit cause I know people who’ve claimed such things but their close family members have said that was a lie and those dogs were abused by the owner.  

Pitbull owners don’t want to take responsibility so they lie and say how they never abused their dogs and how they’ve always been well trained.
This isn’t always the case, but usually it is."

They shouldnâ€™t be banned for existing.  They are great dogs but unfortunately have been a victim of shitty raising.  Listen, I can see where some of the hate comes from but I feel itâ€™s too much.  They are great dogs but need to be socialized properly as a puppy."
