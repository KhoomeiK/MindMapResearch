specializedtools,ffeklff,t1_ffe7aen,1579851954.0,">The first self lighting match was invented in 1805. And it's hard to say when the first regular match was invented. 577 possibly.



The first ""matches"" referred to lengths of cord (later cambric) impregnated with chemicals, and allowed to burn continuously

In China in AD 577 an ingenious man devised the system of impregnating little sticks of pinewood with sulfur and storing them ready for use. At the slightest touch of fire, they burst into flame.

Yes, first modern, ""self"" igniting match set was invented in 1805 by Jean Chancel. But, the head of the match consisted of a mixture of potassium chlorate, sulfur, sugar, and rubber. The match was ignited by dipping its tip in a small asbestos bottle filled with sulfuric acid. Separate pieces.

The 'Promethean Match' was patented by Samuel Jones of London in 1828. His match consisted of a small glass capsule containing a chemical composition of sulfuric acid colored with indigo and coated on the exterior with potassium chlorate, all of which was wrapped up in rolls of paper. To ignite it the glass capsule had to be crushed with pliers and mixed (tool needed).

Similar matches meant for lighting cigars were introduced in 1849 by Heurtner who had a shop called the Lighthouse in the Strand. One version that he sold was called ""Euperion"". But, the Promethean"" and Euperion"" had a tip of acid that had to be broken to start the reaction.

The first successful friction match was invented in 1826 by John Walker, an English chemist and druggist from Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham. He knew several chemical mixtures were already known which would ignite by a sudden explosion, but it had not been found possible to transmit the flame to a slow-burning substance like wood. While Walker was preparing a lighting mixture on one occasion, a match which had been dipped in it took fire by an accidental friction upon the hearth. The first friction match was invented, requiring no additional chemical, acids or mechanical devices.

The first self contained lighter was patented three years earlier."

mechanical_gifs,ff66let,t1_ff5peqe,1579620367.0,"Probably not. If the sheaves and arrested engine fail somehow the cable would just stretch until in breaks. The aircraft would have to do a go around (a bolter). But, if the cable didn't break and it stops the aircraft pretty abruptly it would be okay. Humans can stand a lot of deceleration forces. John Sapp, a flight surgeon and one of my heros, tested G forces and deceleration in the late 40s and early 50s. Mostly using himself as the test subject. He would strap into a rocket sled to see how many Gs he could stand during acceleration and deceleration. On his 29th and last run in 1954 he reached 632mph and survived 46.2 Gs. In this case, say the cable stops them in .5 seconds instead of 2. They would experience 12.67g. That's well within what s human can stand.

Oh, here's a link to a video of a cable snapping on the USS George Washington (CVN-69) in 2003. The F/A-18 in that case didn't have enough power and went off the front of the ship and into the water (crew ejected fine).[https://youtu.be/7OxMox2Kdxs]
