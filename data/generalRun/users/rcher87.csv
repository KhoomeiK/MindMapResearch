This hits a nerve for me, though, honestly. People write off mental health and illness really easily and it _infuriates_ me."
AskWomen,fgo7122,t1_fgmipzi,1580961352.0,I create friendships over shared feelings about the Oxford comma lmao
AskWomen,fgo6yki,t1_fgmhwos,1580961303.0,Omg I love this so much. Adopted.
baseball,fgo6vsy,t1_fgnedka,1580961248.0,"Can’t blame you there, but if your asst coaches are better than ours overall (not hard) it’ll at least stem the potential bleeding. 

I kind of hope Gabe does get a real shot with a solid group, but he has got to get real sometimes. I wish you guys the best, seriously."
baseball,fgo6gpe,t1_fgnhcfs,1580960944.0,"Seriously, that was my thought too. Super classy. One team is a (great) fluke; this seems like a city-wide commitment to inclusion.

Classy."

PoliticalHumor,fgnqizk,t1_fgn6ddg,1580950658.0,"He was already uninvited to CPAC because of his vote on witnesses. 

Which to me, and many of us, is just like “big whoop”, but it’s a pretty influential conference, and it’s a big sign of people trying to run him out a la Amash or others."
PoliticalHumor,fgnq7pt,t1_fgnkvvz,1580950466.0,"And he got word that he had lost support in the Senate IIRC. He didn’t have the votes like Trump did and didn’t want to be thrown out, and didn’t want to be thrown out by any kind of huge majority (possibly). 

If only people still had that kind of wherewithal."
MadeMeSmile,fgnpc71,t1_fgn9wlb,1580949932.0,"Can be normal, but the point is more so that it’s really thoughtful and pretty intimate. It’s kind of low key PDA imo. 

You don’t just go around helping people with their hair, and you definitely shouldn’t be touching people’s hair without asking lmao, but between people who have an intimate relationship (a couple or family/close friends), it’s a sign of trust, intimacy, general kindness etc. 

Not everyone is comfortable with that, even with close family/a partner, so its just kind of nice/adorable to see. You can tell how much he loves her."
hockey,fgno6k0,t1_fgnezng,1580949182.0,Now THAT is the right attitude!
FriendsofthePod,fgno3ul,t1_fgnn3yo,1580949133.0,Okay that’s fair. That’s something drunk me would go for for sure.
