What is obvious we can't do anything right anymore.  We can't build roads quickly or correctly.  We can't have a proper competitive communications infrastructure.   There is a forty mile section of road in my state that has been under construction for the last thirty years.

Technology solves many problems but create many new one.  Especially in schools.
