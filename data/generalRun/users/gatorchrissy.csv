AskReddit,ff4idk5,t3_erhu3x,1579564338.0,"I have the opposite dream, I didn't go to the single class in college and I failed.  I have this dream at least once a month. FYI I did graduate."
offmychest,fekz3it,t3_epndfj,1579210597.0,"This is bullshit not a Boomer I am a Gen X, when I read this post I get angry because I do hire people and if you do have a misspelling on your resume guess what?  Goes in the garbage.  Your appearance has nothing to do with getting a job, your education, work experience and skills is what gets you there.  

That said, I'm no stranger to family issues or depression or anxiety.  I've been there and then some.  My daughters are Millenials and they got a degree that actually got them a job.  I""m not saying your generation doesn't have it tougher than most, but understand as a Gen X we went into a job market with no hope and somehow we got out.  

Look at your opportunities and figure it out.  I'm on Reddit a lot and I feel like it's a soap box of poor me with the housing market, student debt etc.  I graduated from college when everything was complete crap, my first job I was paid 20K and I thought I'd hit the lottery.  I saved and worked hard and now I'm extremely successful in my career.  

Oh and FYI, I've worked in plenty of jobs I HATED, but I knew I needed the experience to get ahead.  I've had shit bosses, put up with sexual harassment, men getting promoted ahead of me and yeah it sucked.  But I never got on social media and bitched about it, I just figured out what I wanted and moved on to something else.

Probably going to get downvoted to hell and get nasty PM's but I don't care.  I came out of a family that had no money - NONE and somehow I came out of it OK.

PS before you say it was a different time, please look at the economy in 1995, it SUCKED.  I had to take a damn car rental management position even though I had a degree at a blue blood college and couldn't find a decent job."

dogs,fc6lq4s,t1_fc6aeeh,1577483549.0,"Sigh, I hope you aren’t serious maybe I’m a gen X party pooper but at the end of day it’s about your family and your retirement. Cats will not support you through college debt."
dogs,fc68kiz,t1_fc5pduo,1577474757.0,"Probably going to get downvoted to hell, but you maxed out your credits cards????  I love my dogs I have two Bassets and one Chorkie, but if it came down to my credit and our house and my kid going to college, that's not even a choice.  Fortunately I do have the funds to treat my pets, but if I had the choice between my credit limit and my pet, it's a no brainer."
