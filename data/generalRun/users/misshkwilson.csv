Here we have a classic example of what I have been learning about in DBT.

The four ways to deal with any problem:

1. Solve it, if you can.
2. Accept it.
3. Change how you feel about it.
4. Stay miserable. 

I suggest that if you can't change it, then change how you feel about it. By ignoring her, you will be staying miserable. It won't make it any better and will probably make it worse. Instead, the SECOND she walks through the door, you explain very slowly and clearly (enjoy this moment where she is NOT ALLOWED TO SPEAK) what your boundaries are around your twins. 

If she laughs it off, tells you you are overreacting, tells you to listen to her, pause, then start again. Once she has heard you, ask her, 'is this something you can agree to?' If she can't give her wholehearted agreement, say tell her that in that case she will have to stay somewhere else. She is welcome to visit but you, your partner and your twins come first in this household.

Good luck!!"
AmItheAsshole,ff1urrc,t3_eqxekx,1579486645.0,"NTA. This is your career. Imagine if your sister was a tailor and had a £2500 dress that she was working on for a client.  Your dog managed to get in and chewed up the dress. She would expect you to fork out for a new dress and to reimburse her for the extra time she would need to spend starting over again. Regardless of whether her child was naughty or had learning difficulties or didn't see the sign etc etc, the outcome is the same. The fact that she didn't offer to reimburse you at the time says a lot about her. I doubt she will pay you a penny but personally I would sue her ass!!"

AmItheAsshole,fefi5oi,t3_eoo84b,1579056817.0,"I would tell someone at your school to raise this as a child protection issue, or report it yourself. This is abuse. You are so vulnerable at 14 years old and even more so with your Asperger's. She knows this and yet she still does this to you. I get that she was really overly concerned about you when you were younger, but now she has gone full circle. She cares so little about you and your needs it is untrue. I think a nice visit from a social worker to explain how what she is doing is completely illegal and against your human rights would do her good. I hope you have a good group of friends and some adults in your life that you can trust. Sending all the best to you xx"

TooAfraidToAsk,fef0efg,t3_elg1a9,1579045242.0,"I am 39 and my boyfriend bought me a plush bunny when I was in hospital. I sleep with Bundog Millionaire every night and I have woken up to find my boyfriend has got him and is having all the snoozy cuddles. I think you will find having a stuffed animal at college is pretty common! But if someone has a problem with it, that is on them. Whenever someone judges someone else, it is because they have got an issue, not you. If they ridicule you, tell them to go fuck themselves in no uncertain terms. Bullying is not acceptable, ever. Wishing you all the best, my friend!"
CongratsLikeImFive,feezs09,t1_fecmtyl,1579044835.0,You literally RULE THE WORLD! Write down everything you have accomplished (notes section in your phone is a great place) so that you can refer to them in times where you feel like you are struggling. You have got this!! All the best for your fantastic future xx
AmItheAsshole,feeu0yi,t3_eon6gr,1579041193.0,"NTA. You have your own family now and you did what is right for you, your wife and your baby. You did a wonderful service to your wider family by including the names of both grandmothers and if they donâ€™t like it, tough. You and your wife get to decide who, what, when, where, why and how in your family. Everyone else can do their pouting elsewhere. Sending much love!"
CrossStitch,fe5swey,t3_enlm9f,1578874221.0,YASSSS that is AMAZING!! Cherish this forever!
AmItheAsshole,fe5soxf,t3_eno5q8,1578874093.0,"You are NTA, my friend. 

The only possible reason I can think of as to why he would want to know what she took is that maybe he thought she was taking something illegal?! But if that was the case (and seeing as he was sooo interested) wouldn't he be more like, umm sharing is caring?!"
AmItheAsshole,fdxgrwu,t3_en6u8a,1578768542.0,"NTA. I recently discovered a very interesting book called Children of the Self-Absorbed by Nina W Brown. I think you should read it to clarify that these arenâ€™t a few innocent remarks, but the manipulative comments of a narcissist. Her parents may very well have done the same thing to her. While you canâ€™t change her, you can choose to put in boundaries as to what you will and wonâ€™t accept from her. Leaving the party was an excellent example of such boundary. The more you do this, the sooner she will learn that her behaviour is only harming her and her relationships. Stay true to you and be strong; she will continue to make this about her for some time, I suspect."
