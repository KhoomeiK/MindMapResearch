gamecollecting,feknh9t,t3_epmcla,1579203715.0,That's awesome!
ForensicFiles,fefwn0g,t1_fdkoz9y,1579067618.0,Completely agree!  I’m looking at you True Crime Daily!
ForensicFiles,fefwk9e,t3_ello19,1579067545.0,"For me it’s the great flow without repetition.  Most crime shows try to be an hour and will replay/re-say the same facts, show the same picture 5-10 times... will recap the entire story after every commercial.  Forensic Files never did that.  Each episode was concise, interesting, non-sensationalized, and actual facts."
ForensicFiles,fefwafj,t1_fdrwqac,1579067282.0,Just make sure you make the suicide note for your daughter while she is at school and knows how to actually spell antifree :D
creepyPMs,feft6g2,t1_feesplw,1579064442.0,How do you call the police when you’re on a leash tho?

creepyPMs,feeq0ig,t1_feeaoyv,1579038784.0,septum rings scream - time to hook up a leash and take you on a walk.

cringepics,fe9arj8,t1_fe8wi72,1578935946.0,She never gave him her number.  That's what's inappropriate.  Who cares?  Her and every other female that has to put up with this crap.
MrRobot,fdqgk48,t1_fdp81vi,1578666123.0,I had never even considered this but your comment makes a TON of sense to me.

retrogaming,fck4g1r,t1_fcj4yu6,1577716297.0,Not sure where you are from or what you do but a jigsaw is NOT a basic tool.
retrogaming,fck4e4b,t1_fcj2to4,1577716252.0,This is not basic tools and zero experience.  Would not even attempt at my current experience level.  I'm more apt to cut off my arm with a saw than successfully make this.

MrRobot,fc24von,t1_fc0slka,1577340532.0,"Yes, and I completely agree."
MrRobot,fc22zqd,t3_eep2ol,1577338343.0,And ALL of that happened before the projection of the movie became his eye.
MrRobot,fc22xjg,t1_fbxv5jn,1577338275.0,ALL of that was said before the projector turned into his eye.  I guess nobody can open their mind to that possibility.  Of course Darlene says everything is real.  She is telling the Mastermind that.
MrRobot,fbx6f8u,t1_fbwsz3x,1577171377.0,"How do we even know what's real though?  If Elliot was in a coma or wasn't awake etc as we're led to believe by the movie projector being his actual eye, then all of this could be entire fantasy.  Nothing in the end actually says he's still in the world we watched him in for 4 seasons."
