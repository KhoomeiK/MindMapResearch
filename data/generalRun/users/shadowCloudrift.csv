I was expecting him and Schofield to go on a long journey together ala Frodo and Sam with Schofield later sacrificing for him. Nope, Blake dies suddenly and it's now a one man's journey. 

Some of the people here say it has no story, but for me it has more of a story over Dunkirk. At the very least we have more of a protagonist with Schofield. At the start we always get the sense that he's weared and wants to go home, but we also find out he's a capable soldier given how he had a medal that gave off for a bottle of wine. We also see how he avoids distracting himself by reminisicing about his family like Blake. After Blake's death, we see how much it affected him and motivating him to complete his mission.

dogfreedating,fdnu5w4,t3_eio9zm,1578592897.0,"Went on a date with this girl from Facebook Dating, this 31 year-old brunette who's an ex-marine and UPS warehouse worker. She seemed pleasant enough.... but canceled on the day of the date twice. Only because she said ""please"" that I gave her a third chance. I did like her strength of character for telling me how she wants to pay for her half of the dinner(she canceled the second time due to being short on money though the first time was because she ""forgot about her escape room plan""). 

The actual date went well with us having Korean BBQ. She was kind eccentric and awkward in a way but endearing. Entire time she was just a ball of energy and made plans about future dates. However... she doesn't really have any hobbies. Her hobbies seem to be her dog, another red flag much like the last minute cancelation. 

A few days later I questioned about meeting up again like she asked on the day of the date. She told me ""she's sorry and trying to find out what she wants and is still looking around/dating."" 

There was also this 40 year-old blonde from Facebook Dating who after texting for a month failed to find the time to meet up. When I confront her about her lack of time, she admitted that she's busy with work, but also ""kind of met someone although not serious."" She was also ""trying to figure out what she want."" So I was basically backup (and possibly for the 31 year-old brunette).
