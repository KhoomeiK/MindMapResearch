If there are more regulations added to this, maybe I wouldn't have this opinion in the first place. I am speaking from experience, not some misinformed asshat."
unpopularopinion,fc7dcag,t1_fc79cao,1577504097.0,"I agree with you 100% and I like your take on it. I didn't expect this much backlash and accusations of also being a pedophile when I'm no such person. I think many people take into account the most serious of offenders and put a label on all people who may have similar tendencies regardless if they actually did something bad.

I personally don't know what that kind of life is like and it's a cruel fate for anyone to have, but this opinion alone isn't to diminish the trauma sustained by those who had to deal with an abusive sex offender. 

Also I don't know if acting on the desire is a good idea because that might involve someone who is a minor and minors aren't capable of reciprocating a good response and can be easily influenced. But for those people who deal with such problems should be able to express themselves to the open world about them instead of hiding and becoming bad and become a potential threat. 

Either way, I appreciate the civilized response and not lowering your arguments to mere insults and garbage slander."

I have seen a few documentaries where pedos seek help, but can't due to societal stigma and other such factors. If people are convicted, they usually go to prison to become better right? If their crime is too severe, then I understand the sentiment to want to kill them. But hey it's an unpopular opinion at the end of the day, you don't have to agree with it."

unpopularopinion,fc3o736,t1_fc3n7om,1577394446.0,Depends on the severity of their crime. I also believe rehab before I think the death penalty tbh. They should be punished and given prison time and I don't object to that. They should just seek help is all.
