I was born in 1988. I began playing video games the literal moment I first remember. I beat Super Mario Bros in 1994 or whenever it came out when I was a tyke. But I have been telling my parents and friends that reality is a simulation since I was like ten probably.

I'll never forget the realization that humans are so young and yet accomplished so much in such a short time. That we already invented computer programs that seemed impossible, so real it was insane. I remember reasoning that mathematically, we must live in a simulation.

If these programs were invented in only a small period of time, and humans would be inventing better programs constantly, it would only be a relatively small period of time until we created simulation that literally felt alive. That lived in their own reality which we created. Physical laws, real emotions, real relationships. Lines of code so complex that they learned and adapted on their own and became just as real as you or I.

If this is true and we assume humans will be around for many more hundreds of millions of years, then it is much more likely you are in that period of hundreds of millions of years when humans can create realistic simulations than it is that you live in a time period of only two million years when we couldnt produce them. Furthermore, there would be 1 reality and possibly infinite other ""realities"" just as real as the original... the chances you'd live in the 1 original timeline are so astronomically slim...

His peak was 32/6/5/1.7/.8 on 46/39/79.

Demarr has never had that kind of peak. In fact, hes probably at his peak now and averaging 22/5/5 on 53.5/32/83 shooting, an outlier (his previous high during high usage seasons was 48/17(!)/83.

So why did we abandon the idea of calling it global warming? I know some areas will actually cool down, but overall globally it is warming. It's a good name.

Maybe we want to encompass the actual change it will affect, which would be changing global climates..."

They want you to spend money in order to avoid ads.

Problem is the posts themselves become paid ads because companies can spend a few dollars to get a post to the top of Reddit by gilding the shit out of it."

The best stout I had this year was Deth's Tar from Revolution brewing.

Best beer I had this year was St Dekkera Excommunie Quatro (sp?). From DESTIHL. It's a barrel aged sour quadruple. It was insane."

OSU has to make a stop right now and then come back with another scoring drive to win."
