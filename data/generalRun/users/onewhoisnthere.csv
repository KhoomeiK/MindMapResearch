gaming,fdf6leo,t1_fdetfcz,1578354489.0,"Right, I agree with you. They lack many of the features Steam has, and has a lot of room to grow.

It still stands that I love gotten 15 FREE games from them in recent months by just subscribing to deal websites. These are good indie games too, not just bargain bin shit. And as the other guy said, he got Control on double discount.

So the point remains, the competition to the marketplace is pro-consumer. We ultimately win by watching Epic battle it out for shares. Can they improve? Yes, and should. But I won't hate on them for also lighting a fire under Steam by saying, hey look, you have to stay sharp because of us, we're going to take your consumers unless you also improvise."
gaming,fdepmt7,t1_fden8kh,1578343986.0,"Look, it's not the consumer's fault for trying to save money, the onus is on the marketplaces to be viable enough to attract the dollars. Steam has been a leader for a long time, Epic comes along and tries to take a bite into the share. 

Yes, aggressively I admit, but in any industry with a leader ahead by 10-15 years, you have to take some drastic measures to wry some share. In the end, the consumer wins here: cheaper (sometimes free) games. 

This is how the market works. Don't blame the consumer for trying to save their hard earned dollars."

We Americans cannot just go to the doctor anytime something bothers us. Even for people who have savings, it can cost 2-7 days worth of income just to SEE the doctor and talk, not to mention any treatment. Then they tell you to just monitor it and come back again if it's still bothering you, costing another 2-7 days of income to revisit.

In short, our healthcare system sucks.

PS- I say 2-7 days income because some regional costs, incomes, and doctor costs vary. A minimum wage person might not even be able to get the time off work or afford the doctor at all, living paycheck to paycheck already for rent, food, and kids."
NoStupidQuestions,fcyri4a,t3_ejg3sv,1578085550.0,"There are a lot of great answers in this thread, but most of them discuss the conceptual side of the equation. There is also a physical side: the Biochemistry; particularly of sleep and waking.

In the morning, your energies are lowest. Your body temperature is low, your metabolism is slowed (you haven't eaten in 8 hours), and your brain has been cleaning itself and not producing neurochemicals for thinking. This is why waking up can take a while, even for the best of us. During this time the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for forecasting thoughts, ""meta"" thinking aka getting your life together, etc is all still ""booting up"".

Middle of the day is ""true tired"", that feeling of, I could seriously sleep right now. Maybe it's after eating lunch and your digestion is taking the energy from your brain, or maybe it's that daily slump in your circadian rhythm.

And then comes the end of the day, although you may seem more tired, you are running on some different biochemistry. For instance, Endorphins and Adrenaline keep you awake, going, thinking, moving. You are ""primed"" at this point. 

At the end of the day, you can finally let your mind wander, giving yourself permission to no longer feel responsible to execute plans immediately. It's in this time that while wandering, you start thinking of what needs to change. With your current biochemical state, you may be feeling pretty inspired, with endorphins to make you feel good about your ideas, and dopamine to think about how you could start them. But of course you're too tired or it's too late to start them now.

The secret here though is to go ahead and do something to get yourself started in the right direction for the next day. Make it easier on yourself to overcome the hump tomorrow, by doing what you have the energy for now. It might be setting something out on your desk, writing an idea down, maybe setting a to-do reminder, or even just laying there and imagining yourself doing the thing tomorrow and seeing yourself in the process of doing it. These things can make a real difference on your motivation tomorrow, you'll be more willing to actually work on it because you've already started! That's sometimes the hardest part.

Hope this helps someone out there."

This will happen one day. And I will have a separate browser only for Google purposes.

This probably won't happen, as too many people are entrenched in MS Windows and Apple Mac by cultural or business needs. Google already knows their Chromebook and OS are only budget lines for older non-tech savvy people. There is no way Google can ever catch up to the 40 years of MS Windows OS development to replace it, especially for businesses."
