Supernatural,ff5p4mf,t1_ff50h1t,1579604230.0,"In all my years, I honestly never knew dream catchers were sacred. I genuinely thought that they were something that someone once made to help a child suffering with nightmares and sort of caught on. 
I live in England and I can‚Äôt say I have been taught about native Americans much. 

I appreciate the info but I think maybe you should have taken the time to explain why this post by the OP is an issue, rather than just spamming the link and talking bad about the OP. 

Thank you for sharing this with us all, just please next time you want to educate people, do it in a not so aggressive way."

A steamer with the metal brush fitting would probably be best though."

I would like to know, do you have to be reminded that you suffer from short term memory loss or that you were in an accident?

Also, sorry to be greedy with questions, do your family have to regularly remind you who they are or because you‚Äôve known them all your life, is it something you won‚Äôt forget?"

cats,fc5g2z7,t1_fc5dqg9,1577456583.0,"Yes we actually have a baby gate at the bottom of the stairs and considered moving it to be honest. Makes perfect sense really, a room she has no access to but the cats can jump over and into it! 

Just thinking the spare room may not always just be a spare and I don‚Äôt want the cats to get into the habit of it being their room later on down the line, especially when trying to keep them out of it later on haha! But for now I have made a temporary table for them in the spare room that the dog can‚Äôt reach and I‚Äôve even put a step ladder next to it for them if they want a casual walk up instead of jumping haha!

I used to put the wet food bowls on the cat tree occasionally but 2 dry food bowls are always down and 2 wet food bowls once-twice a day, it‚Äôs a lot of bowls and I always worry they‚Äôre going to jump up and knock them down lol! The cats throw theirselves around the cat tree ‚Äúpoles/legs?‚Äù And it wiggles a bit haha!

I think I am going to keep looking out for the perfect table/console/unit to put in the conservatory and hope it doesn‚Äôt take too long to find!

Thank you so much for your advice! I will keep hold of the baby gate option in case it becomes an absolute necessity!"
cats,fc5fcsc,t1_fc5dgk4,1577455963.0,"I suppose it is just a case of persistence!
Yeah wiping down surfaces beforehand is a go to anyway! 

I‚Äôve just made a temporary table for them up in the spare room lol! 

Until I can find something perfect for purpose for them for the conservatory at least :)"
cats,fc5ceov,t1_fc5c5eb,1577453179.0,"I did consider a place she can‚Äôt reach instead to be honest but I can‚Äôt think of anything to put there, like I‚Äôve tried googling different things and I feel like I am not googling the correct words or I can‚Äôt find the right thing!

I would just keep it on the table and wipe it each time but I feel like the cats will think it‚Äôs ok to keep trying to jump up etc while we‚Äôre eating! I don‚Äôt want them to think it‚Äôs their space and we are invading their table haha! Although when we cleared and cleaned it for our Christmas dinner they didn‚Äôt jump up once! Maybe that is the winning option."
