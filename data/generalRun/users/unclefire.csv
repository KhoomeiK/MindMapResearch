Edit.  When people take pictures of Danny and  Justin at some random event you all spooge all over each other.  

He was out at a PUBLIC event  and I didn’t bug him about “OMG Tool”.   And neither did anybody else.  FFS he was auctioning off stuff related to Merkin and some Caduceus Vortex weekend room thing in Jerome.

From the CNBC Article-- $28MM clawback on top of the $41MM he gave up when he (Stumpf) resigned.
47.3MM from Tolstedt.    But Stumpf made $286MM from 2011-2016 (fucker).

And this is on top of the fines from the OCC.  IIRC, Stumpf to pay $25MM.  I don't remember Tolstedt's fine (want to say like $20MM)

Both of those assholes should have to give up way more and probably serve time in prison.  FFS, between the two of them they totally trashed the company reputation beyond the issues the company already had on other fronts."

Stumpf and Tolstead (sic?) not only knew full well there was a problem, they exacerbated it every year by increasing the goals with double digit growth every year.   Audit and legal went along for the rid and didn't do shit to stop it.   Management down the line were hazing employees, even those who were not only met the goals, but exceeded them."

IMO, you can have a different mindset on cruises.  There are a variety of things I likely wouldn’t do otherwise but kinda fun/silly on a cruise.  

Certainly check out the pools and otter activities onboard.  You’ll have fun if your attitude is to have fun.   There plenty of music, various shows and other things to do.  Hell you could just chill out and watch the world go by for some of it. 

Also keep in mind that you have days in port so there should be excursions or other things to check out there.

They did their typical bait and switch.   Tax cuts pay for themselves (they don’t) and deficits are horrendous (then increase spending anyway)
