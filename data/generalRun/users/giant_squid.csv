Curious to see more people's replies."
HealthyFood,fdjnu95,t3_ekmip0,1578479989.0,Look at my two sticky posts at the top of /r/sugarfreedom. I hope they help!
bulletjournal,fdhjgtz,t1_fdhhmld,1578423948.0,"I use Pilot G2 pens a lot, and they're awesome (unless you have something like a Leuchtturm 1917)! I just realised last week that they do metallic and pastel pens as well and immediately wishlisted them. Great to hear good things about them!"
bulletjournal,fdhj6n3,t1_fdhf5zz,1578423773.0,"Please keep us updated, though!"
bulletjournal,fdhgag6,t1_fdher1e,1578422020.0,"Best idea! I've been ogling A5 ring binders for similar reasons recently, and I'm currently brainstorming my ideal ring binder setup so I can decide whether that would be a good idea for future bullet journalling."
bulletjournal,fdgdrpw,t3_el9b17,1578391971.0,"I prioritise function over aesthetics. If I'm unsatisfied with a spread (because it doesn't have enough space for one thing or there is too much space somewhere else, or I need a new weekly tracker or whatever) I use the spread, note what's happening, and change it up the next week. Doodling etc is optional."
bulletjournal,fdg8qz1,t3_el089q,1578384832.0,"Yesss! Awesome plan (and tracker). I'm in a similar situation with a damaged nerve, and it does help tons!!! Keep going. You can do this."
bulletjournal,fdg88vc,t3_el3lhc,1578384189.0,"I used to have a work journal that I didn't even realise was a bullet journal. (Now I have a different job at a different company, which has changed everything.) I'd colour code the list of to-dos according to projects or priorities (whatever was happening at the time) and add notes in boxes of the same colour as I went along (what the state of that task was, who I had to call or email, or whether I was waiting for a reply about something). Super simple, and it helped me keep an overview at all times. Also, if a supervisor had a question about anyhting, I could check and reply truthfully within seconds!"
bulletjournal,fdg7tgd,t3_el57cw,1578383636.0,"I use my weekly like a planner, so if it's a slow day at work or if I'm exhausted sometimes there's some empty space. So what?

I've also moved my gratitude from a big yearly collection to a small weekly column, and I try to write down around three positive things each day. (Sometimes it's one or two; sometimes it's even four!) This keeps the nice things where I can see and remember them all the time (and it helps a lot)."
bujo,fdej7a1,t1_fdebsb7,1578340168.0,Sehr gut! :)
bulletjournal,fddr4f9,t3_ekuua7,1578321779.0,"B5 is very difficult to find here (Austria). So far I've seen exactly two B5 dot grid journals (by Paperblanks, and they were beautiful!). But I carry my bujo everywhere I go (I have lots of health and healing related trackers, and I'm overall quite busy and like to stay in control at all times), and I have this feeling that B5, while offering extra space for planning and tracking things, is just a little bit too bulky for me and my bag."
