television,ff7dqe6,t3_erwn2u,1579647192.0,"I'll give it a try but the first season really ran out of steam for me. What struck me how linearly it dropped off too: episode quality ranked from highest to lowest was literally first to last episodes ... best scenes early in episode 1, worst scenes at the end of the last episode. It felt like it was actually written that way."

dyinglight,ff4cbwl,t1_ff3kcet,1579560263.0,You're debited the money for the pre-order when the game actually releases - they don't get any money from your pre-order before release. 10 million users pre-order? 0 cash for the developer.
dyinglight,ff4bs6i,t3_erf31f,1579559915.0,"Kinda obvious this was coming, given barely any info in general, no recent info, and no specific release date so close to the release window.

Kinda annoyed tbh, but I get why."

dyinglight,feia7ja,t1_fe6q8xt,1579133762.0,"Funny thing is, most modern nuclear weapons are smaller* (in terms of destruction zone) than the two dropped on Japan, so harran would be better off if it were a more modern bomb.

*Modern technique is to fire multiple missiles, with around 24 warheads in each. Better to hit lots of targets, get past countermeasures, etc. 

Learned this in a brief stint of guarding nuclear weapons."
todayilearned,fe6j8id,t1_fe6gdq8,1578892661.0,"Ah makes sense, was a bit confused with the direct correlation of numbers - I have plenty of space so 30% more would just mean 30% more to heat and clean. The cat and the dog would probably enjoy it though."

dyinglight,fdh94fk,t3_el0v4p,1578418059.0,Oh god knows. Lots. Mainly by falling off of pylons and water towers in the following.
dyinglight,fddeycj,t1_fdd9pmj,1578309195.0,"This is probably a fair assessment, though it's less the physical size of the environment and more the texture detail. If the game is a native 4k there will be a huge jump in file size. If it's the same as DL1 (it won't be) then it wouldn't be 4x bigger.

One thing people don't realise has a huge impact on file size is audio cause it's very difficult to compress and itself is a high fidelity object. This game looks like it'll have a lot of audio in it so a big file size. 

About 80 seems a fair guess but 100+ isn't out of the question."
Warhammer30k,fdbzvlg,t1_fdb7pne,1578264486.0,"I love me some grave wardens, I find they're a good anvil or counterattack unit cause they're resilient enough to stick around til charges start happening but they force the disordered charge against them, plus they can overwatch. If you're playing the reaping they shine cause your opponent will be desperate to close the gap with your insane amount of heavy weapons, this also forces them to charge units with rad grenades and a sergeant with power scythe - in my experience that massively tips CC in your favour (unless it's 10x red butchers hah)."
Warhammer30k,fdak7my,t1_fdagxlt,1578246925.0,"Oooh yes, hand flamers and ZM are a great combo. They're a fantastic unit in any game though, if used correctly - lack of power fists and heavy weapons changes their role compared to other terminators but when you use them right they absolutely mulch things.

They can brutalise other terminators, striking with AP2 before enemies can retaliate, and get even more nightmarish if you can get Endurance cast on them. 

They're an amazing bodyguard for a Praetor, Mortarion, or Typhon, and you can take them as a command squad!"
