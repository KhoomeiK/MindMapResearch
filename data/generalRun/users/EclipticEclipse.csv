gardening,feekeyu,t3_eoqhyw,1579035539.0,"I'm a Denver-area gardener. I have a large slope on the side of my house dedicated to herbs to help prevent erosion. I have a bunch of herbs that just grow wild there.  They love it, but I do water them in the hot times of the summer. We have oregano, tarragon, dill, parsley, chives, garlic chives, arugula, walking onions, mints, lovage, savory, thyme and whatever grows that year. I also sow edible flower seeds in with the herbs, like pansy, johnny jump ups and borage. I seed some in Spring, but we've had the herbs going long enough that most over-Winter or seed themselves. In a wild herb garden, you will still get weeds.

Clay soil is tough. When we lived in the clay area, we amended with peat, hay and sheep's manure. 

Colorado State University has a Master Gardener program and puts a ton of info online. They're also avaliable by email phone. They can help with figuring out amendments to soil and to decide what plants are best. Local garden centers are also fantastic. I recommend Nick's in Aurora.

Your beds sound nice. We made ours with bricks. 3 feet is perfect height. If you fill with good soil, you probably won't have to weed much for a couple of years."

NoStupidQuestions,fdjusbj,t1_fdjpjc2,1578488198.0,"According to an article on Space.com:

""As of March 2018, the Habitable Exoplanets Catalogue has 53 planets that ""optimistically"" could be suitable for life, and among those, 13 that are more likely to be habitable. The project is a part of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo.""

Article here: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.space.com/amp/25219-drake-equation.html

This, of course, is in no way definite. But out of the quadrillions or quintillions of other planets out there (it's estimated that there are 2-3 trillion in the Milky Way alone), isn't they're a decent possibility that some of them have the ingredients necessary for life, especially rudimentary life? And isn't it likely like started on just a small percentage of those?

NoStupidQuestions,fdiphab,t3_ell5sv,1578448115.0,"I'm not a planetary scientist or exobiologist, so this is a very basic explanation.

Look up The Drake Equation. That's a good starting place to see how scientists try to determine if there's intelligent life that we can possibly communicate with in the universe.

In short, it's a calculation of the odds that there is intelligent life in the universe, and if so, could we ever communicate. The different parts of the equation help scientists to estimate if intelligent life is likely by the number of stars with planets capable of supporting life, if our communication methods could ever reach them, etc.

The way one teacher put it, is there one planet, like a solitary light in the universe, that houses all intelligent life? Or is it like the lights on a Christmas tree, blinking on and off, here and there in the tree? Are the lights ever on at the same time, and will they ever know if another light is on at the same time? 

Then think of all the life on Earth that's developed.  Only one species (that we know of) is capable of communicating with space. It's thought that life has started and restared many times on Earth. Why not in other places? Why would Earth be unique in that, among the almost infinite places in the universe?"
