I understand why you’re frustrated, but that seems like a major oversight."
college,fezjgwe,t1_fezhr5w,1579457997.0,"I don’t think it’s a flex, I think it just doesn’t really fit here. OP just wanted some advice and you’re making it political."
college,few55h9,t1_few12ps,1579405540.0,"Honestly, it’s really fucking hard to forget everything about an exam. OP’s argument also has like zero credibility. OP erased a question and forgot."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fes7et6,t1_fes53a5,1579362172.0,"That assumes the person already has an alternative passion in STEM though. Everyone isn’t going to just become a dentist so they don’t starve. 

Also, being a wage slave to a job that you hate and putting your passions as a hobby is a pretty fucking sad life."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fes3qzp,t1_fertf6e,1579361075.0,"The problem is that there are countless people who have to live shity lives because their major / dreams aren’t culturally valued. It isn’t time fair to them that they are deemed a loser of society at basically the beginning of their adult lives while the winners are making over three times as much as him right out of college. 

This isn’t coming from a salty humanities major either. I was studying CS, then switched to Molecular Biosciences and Biotechnology and will be going to medical school after college. I’m lucky that what I love is deemed a “winner” of society."

You really should not have responded after the second message, but I don’t understand why he didn’t just ignore your message if he wasn’t interested."

IsItBullshit,fdfjspo,t1_fdefypg,1578363362.0,For anyone considering CLEP: [Modern States Freshman Year for Free program](https://modernstates.org/freshman-year-free/) will give you an online self paced version of the class that you can use to study for the exam AND will give a waiver to take the exam for free. I did it once and liked it.

Also, I’d start the process of finding roommates ASAP. Me and a friend both had roommate horror stories and both had to switch rooms this semester. Your roommate can have a bigger impact on your success than you can imagine. You’ll be much happier having a good roommate."
