offmychest,ffh04oc,t3_et3we3,1579919551.0,You sound like quite a catch. Have you ever thought of posting on /r/FreeCompliments to get a wider audience's opinion on your appearance? It might help your self image to hear some more viewpoints.

JustNoSO,fffiyh8,t1_ffff7jo,1579884968.0,Context. It brings context and a reinforcement of your counterpoint to the comment you replied to that said the men were the ones who say to clean as you go.
JustNoSO,ffdpwar,t1_ffdmevo,1579826125.0,"Woman here. Washing as you go is a lot easier and faster when you have a dish sponge wand that holds dish soap, and a dish drainer.

What I do is start with prep, cut up the veggies and meat, then immediately wash my knives and cutting boards and put them in the drainer. Then I begin adding ingredients to whatever bowl, pan, or pot I'm cooking with, and as I go I wash the measuring utensils and other spoons and containers and put them in the drainer. Then as things get moved, set aside, or transferred, I immediately wash the previous dish and put it in the drainer. And I wipe off any spills I make immediately. I don't go crazy trying to keep the kitchen spotless, but taking 3 seconds to quickly clean a used utensil or spill while it's still fresh and easy makes clean up so much easier."

ADHD,ffd05x0,t1_ffcbvgo,1579810823.0,"Employment screenings are a kind of grey area. If your results contain metabolites of illegal drugs, that may not qualify for HIPAA protection because it's not related to your medical care. Also sometimes the labs may not qualify as a medical provider but are a contracted agent of the employer and therefore might not be covered under HIPAA that way. Regardless of those two grey areas, in most cases, employers and labs participating in employment-related drug screenings usually make prospective employees sign waiver forms that basically say by consenting to the test, you are also consenting to the employer receiving the results, which allows the lab to share those results without a breach of HIPAA. 


However, it's poor lab work for the lab to do it this way. Many legal, prescription drugs metabolize into substances that are the same as some illegal drugs. Usually what a reputable lab will do is run a sample first through a faster and cheaper test (called an immunoassay), and if nothing hits, you're good. If something DOES hit, they send the sample in for another round of secondary confirmation testing with a test that is slower and more expensive but highly accurate and able to differentiate between the breakdowns of illegal drugs and prescription drugs (usually GCMS or HPLC). At that point, they should compare those results to your provided prescriptions and dosages and identify any results that are not consistent with your prescribed medication. 


The lab should not be making any disclosures to the employer until after the secondary testing and prescription analysis is done."
relationship_advice,ffco70n,t1_ffawelj,1579803644.0,"That's an emotional abuse and manipulation tactic (along the lines of a DARVO technique) that flips the script to put her in the victim role and puts all of the focus into you managing her emotions rather than her managing her own bad behavior. She is being abusive to you. 


The trick here is to figure out whether her abusive actions are because she IS an abuser, or because she has FLEAs (Frightening [or Frustrating] Lasting Effects of Abuse) from being abused herself. She might just be an abusive person, or she may have learned abusive behaviors and communication methods from her parents or past partners. Do some reading and research into abusive relationships, emotional abuse, manipulation tactics, the cycle of abuse, and maladaptive behaviors and see what rings true for your wife and your marriage. The Out Of The FOG website and support subreddit resource pages are a great place to start.  


If after your research, you believe she's a good person who doesn't mean to hurt you, you both should spend time in individual therapy with a goal of heading to couples' therapy. If you can look back and see the red flags and believe she may be an abuser, seek your own therapy and work to free yourself from her but DO NOT go to therapy WITH her. Abusers only use therapy to learn how to abuse you better."
Mildlynomil,ffcm1wh,t1_ffcfxau,1579802326.0,I'm so glad your husband is on your side. I hope this trip works out to be the best it possibly can!

Mildlynomil,ffcdytn,t1_ffcdg5i,1579797401.0,.... that totally missed the point.
