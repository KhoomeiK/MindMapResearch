For what it’s worth, I use this [shampoo](https://www.aveda.ca/product/5311/62084/hair-care/shampoo/rosemary-mint-purifying-shampoo) and this [conditioner](https://www.aveda.ca/product/5293/62086/hair-care/conditioner/rosemary-mint-weightless-conditioner). It’s not a girly scent but it makes my hair feel really clean and the mint in it makes my scalp tingle pleasantly. Just use a small amount of shampoo. Doesn’t hurt to wash twice in one shower if your hair is oily or if it’s been a few days. Condition every day if you have dry hair or once a week if you have oily hair."

_Solid bulk cargoes – defined as granular materials loaded directly into a ship’s hold – can suddenly turn from a solid state into a liquid state in a process known as liquefaction._

_The phenomenon is triggered by an increase in water pressure that makes solid bulk cargoes (granular materials that are loaded directly into a ship’s hold) turn from a solid state into a liquid state, causing a ship to tilt and potentially capsize. It can occur when cargo is loaded into the hold – this often involves a fall from significant heights, or when it is exposed to agitation by the ship’s engine vibration or movement of the waves._"

She came home to find the pot still on the back burner licked clean and a ladle and bay leaf on the floor, also licked clean. We never saw her get up on the counter before or after. Poor thing. She had the runs for days."

onguardforthee,fdf11ek,t1_fdej42o,1578350890.0,"I dunno. My family isn’t that well off and we got a whopping $10 a month in child benefits. I don’t see it being a financial incentive to the rich. Better to just make them mandatory for children attending any school (public OR private) or any other community centre, camp, club, team, etc. If private tutors are the only way you can ever do anything for your kids, I imagine that would eventually make all parents vaccinate except for those in cults or who leave the country."

As a lady, I also recommend proposing before the trip."
funny,fcz3svy,t1_fcyyyl9,1578093091.0,"My then boyfriend and I were in a hot spring at a resort and we had just been talking about how trashy some couples were being by making out and being super touchy feely in the pool. Then he asked for my hand. I said no because I fully expected him to take it and put it on his junk under the water, just because we’d been talking about it. He asked me three times before I said _fine_ and gave him my hand. Then he put the ring on it and asked me to marry him. I asked him “are you serious?” at least twice before I managed to say yes. 

I’ve told my friends the truth of that but for family and others I take out the hand on junk part. Lol. I imagine our kids won’t get the full story till they have their own proposal story to tell us."

todayilearned,fcvww3u,t1_fcvlv3t,1578011940.0,"I don’t know. I think that I’d continue my relationship with my child in the hope that eventually they would feel remorse and repent (I’m not talking religion here, it just has the right feel for what I’m trying to express). As a parent, I’d want to see that; to know that they’re not evil and I didn’t do everything wrong raising them (logically I know we cannot control another person but I’m sure every parent of a criminal thinks “where did I go wrong?”). I wouldn’t absolve them of their crime and I believe they should serve their sentence, but I would want to encourage rehabilitation. I’m a mother myself and I just can’t imagine cutting all ties. My only concern in OP’s situation is that I also wouldn’t want to hurt my daughter, so it would be a very fine line to walk."

In Canada, only the province of Quebec has laws in place which require anyone with first aid or medical training to try and help. Anywhere else it is up to you if you feel comfortable and safe trying to help. Throughout the whole country there are Good Samaritan laws in place."
coolguides,fc8oq5k,t1_fc8fiz5,1577539196.0,"If you haven’t already, sitting down and documenting your actual net worth and where every cent is spent really helps the mind game as well. Knowing how much debt I had and how much I was paying in interest and how much I would pay in interest if I continued to pay minimums made me really want to pay it off and keep those thousands of dollars in my own pocket. Knowing I was spending the equivalent of a week’s vacation at an all inclusive resort at Starbucks was enough to make me rein in that habit. It’s been a multi year process but I’m out of debt, have a positive net worth, and have cash savings for all of life’s expected outlays (like Christmas and vacations). I used the program YNAB but you could as easily use excel."
