We aren’t just anxiety, though we do live with that illness. It was also a good reminder to keep taking care of your self even when you are feeling good. Thanks for writing this. ❤️"

Hypoglycemia,fe2khat,t1_fe0atyt,1578839505.0,"I just try to keep my blood sugar up all the time. I eat about every 3 hours. I make sure my snack has protein, fat, and is lower on the glycemic index. That keeps me feeling stable. If I get off of this important rhythm, and I start struggling with my blood sugar and start feeling that anxiety, I make sure to get my blood sugar up fast. I drink juice, but then pair it up with a snack that will take care of my blood sugar and not make me crash. I also have learned some cognitive behavioral techniques that help tremendously. Eating to keep my sugar normal helps a lot! However life has triggers and so it is good to follow up eating right with techniques proven to help anxiety. I thought journal, do  breathing exercises, and have found activities to help me relax. I would love to share how to do any of those  with you, however this is getting lengthy! I know your can do this and you can start feeling better! 😊"

bipolar,fcyssx3,t3_ejll8f,1578086311.0,I have used the day-light from Carex. It is pricier. But it was very convenient because of the positioning. It could be on legs or just on the table. My mom has used the verilux happy light for over 10 years and really likes that.
Anxiety,fcys2cy,t3_ejkpn2,1578085869.0,"Anxiety is the worst. CBT has worked the best for me. I “thought journal” which has me write out what triggered me, my thoughts, my feelings, and  what alternate or true thoughts I could think instead. It really helps my brain snap out of anxiety. Also I use a breathing technique that is helpful. You breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds and hold for 4 seconds."

CICO,fct5m3z,t3_eiqu8n,1577933481.0,"Protein pancakes are what I call them: 

Basically it is: 

1/2 low fat cottage cheese
1/2 quick oats
3 egg whites

You blend it and cook them like pancakes. 

It makes 8 tiny pancakes and each one is only 34 calories! 

I top them with applesauce, 5 cal whipped cream and berries, peanut butter, syrup, or whatever topping you can think of. 

You can mix in banana or pumpkin or cinnamon for a different flavor as well! 

They are divine!"
