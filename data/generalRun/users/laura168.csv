Sometimes I think to myself, ""but what if I'm making this all up?!? Could I just get out of bed and do whatever?!?"" Spoiler alert: I'm not, and I can't. And you're not making it up either."
cfs,ffegwx9,t3_et2hef,1579847553.0,"February of 2017. I'm in my third year of being a primary teacher, it's the second week of that school year, and I get tonsilitis. 

The previous year, 2016, I had an incredibly difficult and stressful class. I was looking forward to having a relatively much easier class in 2017, and was a bit annoyed and amused that I got tonsilitis in only the second week. I was exhausted, and was spending all my non-work time in bed. I never recovered from that exhaustion."
