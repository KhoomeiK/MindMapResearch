depression,ff758tk,t3_eruu6o,1579641378.0,"Your not the only one man. same thing happened to me and we work at the same place. no response to text and work is just awkward as fuck now

at least you didnt get something like this man you can see how friends turn out to be. when your too depressed and they cant handle it 

It's all your own doing. I'm finally sick and tired of always repeating my self to you. I'm at my point where I've had enough of your nonsense. Grow the fuck up be a god damn man and go look for another chick. She does not want anything to do with you anymore and if she complains to me again about you massaging her our relationship will be strictly professional and that's it.i dont know how many times I have to tell you Joe. When she makes up her mind that's final. I've known her for close to a decade now. I know how she is. So as for you stop living in a fantasy land. Be a man and move on. After today, I will not be repeating my self again. Take a screen shot of this or save it if you need it to be repeated."
depression,ff2b89x,t3_er3j14,1579499410.0,I know how it feels I too have stopped opening up to friends. A hug for you. Your not alone
BreakUp,fdz4cky,t1_fdz22c0,1578786570.0,its because of me man i kept begging her back and after that she choose to ignore me. so what did i end up doing? i kept getting desperate more and more. i ran everything to the ground. dont let it kill you i know she thinks of you. cry out those feelings if you have to. dont let it destroy you though. like it did to me.
BreakUp,fdz1b7w,t1_fdyzlxs,1578785692.0,"my ex was thinking of me the first couple of months. yet i keep initiating contact and making it worse putting my feelings out there for her. that alone pushed her away more and she just didnt want anything to do with me anymore. i cry sometimes too but i been crying over someone who doesnt love me like i loved them. 

ima tell you what someone told me. “for everyday that you spent with her it takes twice as much to start get over her”

i know you dont wanna forget her. right now give her time. idk how much but rebuild yourself for now."
BreakUp,fdyyw53,t1_fdyuggd,1578784950.0,"my man i would for right work on you trust me. do what makes you happy. dont worry about her right now. if she comes back she will. your gonna go through a lot of phases up and down. i know this is what you dont wanna hear. yes it takes people time to realize what they once had. like my ex has this motto “you fuck up once we are done” always hated it. i knew same thing would happen to me someday throughout the relationship. the phases i went through i destroyed so much. i should have deleted her number from the start but i didn’t. i know exactly how you feel and you would do anything to get her back. right now your healing too. your not pathetic man your worth something and she lost it. didnt see the good in you just like my ex. dont worry about what others think. this year make it about you and be selfish. let her come to you. give her space to think because i know she still thinks of you here and there. 

i would say for now go to the gym and let off some steam. it might help. so anytime your thinking of her wether your sad or angry go lift the weights. the weights are there to listen to you they dont talk or judge you in anyway. they welcome you. use it as therapy.

my man just listen to me i dont want you to end up like me. my bestfriend hates me and tells me to fuck off and stop bothering her. this is what i got the other day when we were all there and i wanted to keep hugging my ex but i held to long. 

best friend that has known her for 10 years. he choose her side over mine. its sad to see what he says right below

BreakUp,fdytwor,t1_fdxvorp,1578783521.0,you i been thinking about my ex for almost a year. yet now the bridges are burned. im sad but nothing i can do and she doesnt want me. if you wanna talk about it can let me know
depression,fdmp30m,t1_fdmo9si,1578558855.0,I know what I wanted and that was to spend my life with my ex. yet that cant happen anymore. The way I am now is unbearable and my friends cant stand me. Choosing this path feels the correct way. Idk what my purpose is in life but maybe this is what it has to be
BreakUp,fdih3r1,t3_elhdvg,1578442774.0,its like he/she says trust me im almost going a year and still missing my ex and checking up on her. i should he over this but I’m not ya know. the first month is the hardest but try your best to not talk to him. you wont be able to control yourself in what you really wanna say because deep down i know your hurt. I have been there.
depression,fdfds0m,t1_fdeyhva,1578359325.0,happens to me as well. i’m just gonna stop messaging them really
BreakUp,fcx5bve,t1_fcx2qw8,1578051871.0,Idk when i will let go. I already kinda see where I’m headed. Being alone and closing myself out.
selfharm,fcwkhz7,t3_ej9ah3,1578028126.0,28 now i began to cut when i broke apart. after saying something i shouldn’t have said. tried to apologize but ended up getting called a shitty person. i took that to heart and wanted to punish myself. i started to cut my arm not once but multiple times. it has been a while now and i try not to cut. sometimes i want to but i cant. all my friends will just say shit to me or tell me its selfish.
BreakUp,fcvpvkv,t3_ej0hsf,1578007413.0,"1. i cant talk to my friends about it anymore. dont think anyone wants to help me or has time to hear my shit. its been 8 months or 9... forgot so usually im only taking to myself. blaming myself for everything

2. i dont wanna let go. i feel like i can change my ex somehow."
depression,fcbb9ar,t3_egx62k,1577584752.0,Happy Birthday! You will pull through. Your a strong person inside remember that.
BreakUp,fcb77aj,t3_egwp1q,1577583258.0,your not alone. almost 9 months for me and im still not over my ex. i keep wishing her back. i failed no contact many times. i done everything i can but i feel hopeless. i try and distract myself at work  operating trains and it helps here and there. just like the other person said do what you did before. its gonna be ups and downs ya know. remember you are always a beautiful person no matter what anyone says.
BreakUp,fbf9oj7,t3_ed1mvx,1576805195.0,"its been 8 months for me and i am the same about my ex. just take it one day at a time. for right now maybe give her space. please trust me on this. i failed no contact miserably and i kept making things worse to the point where all my feelings got bottle up and i vented talking behind her back. now she hates me. i’m at a point in life where i want no one else but her

besides all that just try and go to the gym and relieve some stress. every time you think of her lift and lift continuously. i know it hurts a lot and i have felt it day in and out. cant tell you what to do because you might not wanna do it. 

remember give her space and time to think. don’t contact her. its gonna be the hardest thing. do not check her social media either. 

i’m not sure what else to say i just don’t want you to make the same mistakes i have done."
