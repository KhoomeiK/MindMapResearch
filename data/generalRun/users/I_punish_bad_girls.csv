Here’s another way:

You pick which house you join, and I’m friends with a handful of dudes 20 years later- haven’t paid dues since 2002

I’m also not friends with some of those dudes, but I learned a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to learn to get along with assholes for the benefit of yourself and the team, the team being the jerks you work with and are paid by for your entire career.

Also worth noting fraternity dues was an insane investment because one guys parents’ owned a company I was hired at for my first job(after they got my foot in the door for a 3month internship). That connection really set my career in motion which has been at least halfways lucrative.
