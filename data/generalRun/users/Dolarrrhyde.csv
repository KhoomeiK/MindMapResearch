taoism,ffd3x44,t1_ffd2ka4,1579812933.0,"Ah okay, I see what you're saying. I actively try not to purchase more food than I need, and perhaps my mistake is assuming that other people also do this, when in reality most people probably just buy however much of whatever looks good when they're at the store without much regard for whether or not it will be consumed.

I remember specifically like 15 years ago when my friend's family let a $60 steak in the fridge go bad. I was so broke back then that I could barely afford food at all. That was aggravating. 

Very interesting, thanks for the excerpt!"

taoism,ffcosig,t3_esw529,1579804010.0,"Most food that goes bad or goes uneaten can be composted. The carbon, nitrogen, etc. can then be taken up from the soil by plants, grubs, worms, other insects, etc. In this case, nothing is wasted. There is an anthropocentric misperception in the assumption that something needs to be used by humans in order for it to not be wasted."
