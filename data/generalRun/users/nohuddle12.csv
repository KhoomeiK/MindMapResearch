videos,ffcns8v,t1_ffcetyp,1579803392.0,"That's how an officer told me it works in NJ.  It just adds a layer of corruption though.  The state then starts ordering the municipal forces to write certain summonses they want, and sweeten the pot by doing it with a ""grant"" of this money to fund police OT to write the tickets they want.  

The more you comply with the state, the more of that sweet state OT money the town gets so the captains can distribute it to their ""crew"" of guys who go along, that they can ""count on""."

In the hospital on an IV with basic nutrients she'd perk right up, but decompensate without it.  It was almost as if her small intestine just didn't transfer nutrients to her bloodstream anymore.  She decided to go home and die in her sleep rather than live on an IV."

When he first retired and moved to PA he used to buy apples and deer corn for the deer on the winter.

In the US, for instance, there are only 3 parties in most people's minds.  R, D, and crazy-conspiracy-theory-mother-fuckers. 

 This is why the US is either gonna get Trump, or people who hate Trump are gonna go with Biden even though he clearly shows signs of early onset dementia.  Either one of those two isn't going to advance ANY climate change remediation.
