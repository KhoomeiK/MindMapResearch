To answer your question: I got tired of crusader spamming blessed hammer, so I assumed - barbarian- would be more focused on actual melee combat.
Doesn't it seem a little silly to have like 5 magical classes and then make the damn barbarian equally rave flashy? With nothing to resemble an actual melee fighter except during leveling? 

Suppose that's why I don't play the game.

It's funny, this has been on my mind for a while after also starting a replay of DkS2.

It is very very cool how you can pick between the Cathedral or postpone it until Irithyll, which I'm now realizing has a similar interconnectiveness to the Cathedral which comments here are rightfully praising.

Some highly cherishable things about the Cathedral of the Deep:

- The enemies are all amazing. None too annoying besides the maggot type monsters. The enemies are varied and very fun to fight, yet fairly intimidating the first time you go there. I love the impact and weight of the Cathedral Knights from their attacks to when they are put to rest. The ominous but easy priests that eerily rp walk towards you. 

- The connectiveness and layout of the place

- The Diablo 1-esque vibe of it

And my favorite.. The highly imposing archetecture and the way it is believable that it was an actually beautiful and functional cathedral once, built in all it's unnatural glory to venerate the Way of White but it has succumbed to the curse and there is no one around to remember it. It has become dark, corrupt and its filled with the sludge that is the residue of Aldritch (how I interpret). 


HIGHLY honorable mention: IT IS YOUR FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE RED HOOD. One of the most charismatic and well-voiced characters of the game. He is absolutely outstanding in his intro to the game and portrays the wicked and almost dreamlike,  out-of-place, everything-has-been-twisted-up feeling that DkS3 does better than any game ever made. 

That's what comes to my mind in response to the question posed, remember this is just one persons take on the matter."
EliteDangerous,ff31q6a,t1_ff2piju,1579531370.0,"Oh absolutely - I think this game demands AT LEAST to be played with controller.
It's more that idea of being at maximum comfort and just drift away into space on an oversized screen like I personally do with NMS.
But even NMS kinda loses a huge chunk of its power for not being Elite Dangerous. 
My whole point was pretty much just that this stunning game deserves to be enjoyed as thoroughly as humanly possible, and screenshots like yours and others on the sub are a fantastic reminder of how beautiful the game is, and how little we are in this universe. Much love to the Commanders out there."

RedDeadOnline,fek8zyu,t1_fek6of3,1579195109.0,"I'm also on xbox 

the 10 minutes part you mention is news to me since I've had at most 2 minutes the few times I have used parley. It must be either new or I have been bugged at unlucky times, though I always preferred to farm griefers instead of parley. That still doesn't make it more fun or immersive for me. Even then, dying doesn't really cost you anything but time. I never used to die much in pvp but I remember being tired of getting roped into fights with random people I didn't care about hence why I am asking how things generally are now. 

Most of my playtime was before the roles so it might just be that the lack of content back then made everyone much more aggressive in game world. Could be they were just jelly of my fashion."

RedDeadOnline,fek3zlw,t1_fek2r6r,1579192122.0,"I probably didn't convey it well but I'm well aware of the defensive mode mechanics. It doesn't work like passive mode in gta. 
It doesn't stop randoms from nuking you with explosives if you for a second seem like you're not on your toes from what my countless hours in the game have shown. 
From my experience: parley aside from being a little defeatist in nature, only gives you little time to get away from a gank squad and if they killed your horse you might as well restart the game because they will be on your ass like white on rice.

I suppose my inquiry was more about the general attitude of players nowadays. though I realize it's a big question with no real answer, I think you  submitted a good response to that after the first point."
