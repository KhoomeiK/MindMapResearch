IdiotsInCars,fenc2rs,t1_fenb7fu,1579281484.0,"I think you misunderstand what ""white privilege,"" is. It's simply the benefit of being treated differently. whether you're poor or you're rich, ""whiteness"" is something many races aspire to ""be."" For example, in Korea, speaking perfect English is viewed as some kind of mark of nobility. In southeast Asia, there are skin whitening creams that women apply to themselves, etc.

Does this mean that every White person has it easy? Obviously not. It's just that there are less obstacles OR people are more likely to engage with you than not, simply by the color of your skin. Think of it as a ""stat,"" in an RPG if you want. It does not define you're entire career path, but it definitely impacts it. There is a difference here I think you're missing."
IdiotsInCars,fenaohd,t1_fen9v2h,1579280621.0,"Lol. Ironically, I would also guess you have no idea what a ""systemic"" problem is or deny they exist. You probably wouldn't understand how the corporate system in place, incentivizes the status quo. There are admirable people doing the good fight. Similarly, one man can't make a dent to the environment by recycling everything he has when more than 85% of global pollution is produced by gigantic corporations/businesses. This is a policy problem, and it's tough to change something on this level. Social justice is tough to achieve. For instance, you can still get fired for simply being gay in many states. 

Denying white privilege is similar to denying obvious things like climate change or a global earth. Flat earthers can't *feel* the the earth moving. A lot of White people can't *feel* their privilege. Once you've had a privilege for so long, it actually starts feeling like a right.

And since you're projecting, you assume I do nothing about it. Why would you assume this if you're being sincere? Because irl, the opposite is true. It's almost as if you don't actually care about the issue. You just want to be right."

IdiotsInCars,femd42r,t1_fel696s,1579249377.0,"Based on your responses, it seems like you‚Äôre incapable of putting yourself in the shoes of someone more disadvantaged than yourself. You‚Äôve checked off every checkbox for basic white privilege to a tee. And no, that‚Äôs not racist, it‚Äôs a statistical fact. If you think White people are not treated differently by most cops than you‚Äôve never left your bubble.

Racial profiling is a thing. Example - Just like how Brown ppl are more likely to be stopped for checks at the airport. There is a flipside to that also. You think White ppl are checked as frequently? This is an analogous example to what we‚Äôre talking about. Don‚Äôt be deluded.

Also, in reply to your comment about how ppl should know the law or get a lawyer to ‚Äúempower‚Äù themselves to protect themselves from the ppl who *should* be protecting them - Some people are incapable of empowering themselves and are literally at the mercy of these people. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard the recent story of the 6 cops who assaulted and killed a schizophrenic man:
