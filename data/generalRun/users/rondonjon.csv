Futurology,fffd4io,t1_fff3is9,1579881326.0,LOL please. So now we are going to live in some kumbaya dreamland where exploitation and thirst for power no longer exist because you got rid of taxes and government and let the “free market” take over?

Saying taxes aren’t necessary is just plain silly.  Unless you want to return to a feudal system or live in a world where massive corporate conglomerates and oligarchs rule. No thanks."
