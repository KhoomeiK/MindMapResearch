AskReddit,feiyupw,t3_epe07v,1579151090.0,I once was staying at my aunt and uncle’s place and my attractive female cousin was in the other room sleeping. I was sleeping on the couch. I couldn’t manage to get enough courage to go propose something sexual with my cousin (thank God) but I did end up fucking the couch cushions and not cleaning up after myself.

AskReddit,feixq8s,t3_ep7tm4,1579150127.0,"When I was in a deep depression it was Blind Melon ‘New Life’. It’s a song about Shannon Hoon (singer for the band) trying to get clean so he can be a good father to his yet to be born child. The song is so hopeful, but he sadly died of an overdose just after his child was born."
AskReddit,feixk2v,t1_feiwkuc,1579149986.0,"I’m the husband! I realize the “gun in mouth music” thing is pretty fucked up, especially given the context, but it’s something that came about from being depressed and somehow makes sense even though it’s terrible. Also it’s a reference mainly to the Alice In Chains song “Dirt”."
