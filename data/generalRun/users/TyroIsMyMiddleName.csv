Resolution is not the most important aspect of a game for me, and the drop wasn't **that** bad. I experienced some drifting, but it was manageable with a screen reset every now and then. 

I would say go for it. You'll get to play regular PS4 games on a big screen, and when you play a PSVR game, you get full use of it :)

Originally released in 2006, but it has gotten regular updates and the last DLC was released in 2019. It has everything you *might* want in a RPG: story, tiered loot, upgrades, custom skill trees, inventory management, interesting areas and enemies, physics, etc. 

I return to this gem every now and then just to play through it again. Oh, and it has coop multiplayer, including local, if you're interested in that sort of thing :) Not too expensive on steam either, and this should preferably be played on PC, as the ports to console is not very well optimized."

* I need the physical version. I'm mainly on Playstation, and the only digital games I own are the ones that haven't got a physical release, like some indie and/or VR games.
* I need all in-game stuff available. Exclusive pre-order or collector's edition cosmetics? I need it! Lately this have become more of a ""I want it"" thing, which is good. For my wallet at least.
