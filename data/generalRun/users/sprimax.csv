unpopularopinion,fewc7e0,t3_eqqw0c,1579408244.0,"1. it is important to respect and understand a dog's body language if you want to avoid getting hurt. if you get close to a dog's face and can't tell the dog is stressed or agitated, that is your own fault.
2. dogs are not full grown adults who know right from wrong. whatever they know comes from their owners. a good owner will train a dog well and a bad owner won't. the same way you don't tell a baby who acts out that they should be kept away from other children. it's not the baby's fault that they don't know any better since they don't comprehend anything, let alone right or wrong.

rarely any living creature is inherently bad or dangerous. you do not go into the lion's den expecting the lion to not eat you, because that is what a lion does. the same way if someone gets in your face, you will react by pushing them away. or if you annoy a bee then it will sting you. there is always a reason an animal will do something and the reason we have dog trainer's is to understand why the animal is exhibiting that behaviour in that specific circumstance (even if no one is up in their face) and they work to train them properly. they are not vicious animals by nature and they can easily be taught how to behave. the difference between humans is that we cognitively learn right and wrong pretty early on, but dogs aren't the same, so you cannot expect a dog to behave as maturely as a human who is far superior intellectually."
unpopularopinion,fewa74f,t3_eqqm9i,1579407443.0,"although humans aren't monogamous by nature, you have to remember that humans are also not robots and that we have emotions and thoughts separate to what is innate. a lot of people have a need for romance and choose monogamy based on the morals and philosophies they have followed throughout their life. it's pretty common now that most people want to feel special and that monogamy is successful in achieving that. and with only prioritizing sex, love becomes futile and it's a pretty miserable existence without experiencing love outside of familial obligation. 

i believe that moving away from relationships to hook up culture is only going to cause problems in society. people who care less, people who are more selfish, a lack of growth by not being able to share a special life experience strictly with one other individual. although i don't have a general issue with hook up culture, and i believe it is a period of life that nearly everyone will go through, i don't think it should be the primary way."

infp,fegu68n,t3_ep1jon,1579102610.0,"YES. COMPLETELY. i believe this is why i'm drawn to acting. i want to be all these different people, i want to live all these different lives and discover all these different feelings. i want to be everywhere and do everything, but i think with such wide and hopeful dreams comes the crushing sensation of being overwhelmed. you start asking, how? how do i achieve this, is it even possible? why should it even be me? what could i possibly do? i want to do all these things but who says i have the ability to. i've always pondered the purpose of life. 

i tend to go with the theory that everything happens for a reason and it's part of a bigger picture. but it doesn't stop the fact that i know i will strive for all these things in life and yet we'll all end up in the same place; dead. what makes anything worth it? well yeah it's the little moments. playing with dogs, hanging out with friends, watching a sunset, eating good food... because for these moments i don't have to think of any purpose, i'm just there enjoying it. i don't know why i'm here or what i'm supposed to do, but if i'm here already, what's the point of doing nothing? i am not here to fulfil anything other that what i desire at any given moment. 

try to look at it from the existentialist point of view. a knife is created for cutting. it's essence precedes it's existence. with humans, it's the opposite. we are not created with any purpose, rather we are created, and then it is up to us what we choose to have our purpose be. look at some of the stuff jean paul sartre says. in general, i think looking at different philosophies and schools of life really help put things into perspective. there's a wonderful channel on youtube called pursuit of wonder that makes excellent videos about stuff like this"
infp,fegt4fo,t3_ep1p2z,1579101928.0,"i look at it in the sense that we've all got our own personal issues. there's this idea that we should love someone unconditionally for simply being themselves however they are, but the thing is that we get into these relationships or we fall in love with people for the things they have to offer for us. whether it be that they are the kindest person you met, or the funniest, or whatnot. without these qualities that draw you specifically to them, what reason do you have to be in love with them? 

if someone starts to become different, letting their insecurities take over in a negative and harmful way, it's unfair to expect someone to still feel the same. i think support is still important, but it's really difficult to love someone when they make it seem like there shouldn't be anything to love about them. it's completely ok to get down sometimes and need someone to love you and support you, but all in all if you aren't able to love yourself on your own, you become dependant on another person to show you this love and make you feel worthy and that's where it becomes unhealthy and dangerous. 

i love my partner and they are free to come to me whenever they need and i will always support them, but there are just some things that we need to be independent in. they cannot base their whole life worth and being on me. so the way i see it, loving yourself first is about independency."
ChoosingBeggars,fegs075,t3_eow5cl,1579101179.0,"i have a similar story to this. i worked at a cafe and it was just me and another girl working that shift. a young woman orders some cold drink (i don't even remember what it was exactly) and asks for regular milk in it. i'm also really anxious and i was new so i was really wary about not fucking up orders. i had to confirm to her 3 times that this was the drink she wanted and the other girl working could hear it on the headset too.

 i make her drink and give it to her and she says ""this is with soy milk right?"" and i was like ""no, it's just the regular drink you ordered"" and she's like ""i ASKED for soy milk."" i know for a fact she didn't but ok, the most i could do is just remake her drink so i say ""i can remake it for you with soy milk"" and she goes ""ugh no it's fine i'm gonna be late anyway. but next time, it's on the house ok?"" and i literally didn't even know what to say so i just said ok because she was holding up the line. i turn to my coworker and i was like, ""you heard her order the regular drink right?"" and she confirmed i was right.

unpopularopinion,fewc7e0,t3_eqqw0c,1579408244.0,"1. it is important to respect and understand a dog's body language if you want to avoid getting hurt. if you get close to a dog's face and can't tell the dog is stressed or agitated, that is your own fault.
2. dogs are not full grown adults who know right from wrong. whatever they know comes from their owners. a good owner will train a dog well and a bad owner won't. the same way you don't tell a baby who acts out that they should be kept away from other children. it's not the baby's fault that they don't know any better since they don't comprehend anything, let alone right or wrong.

rarely any living creature is inherently bad or dangerous. you do not go into the lion's den expecting the lion to not eat you, because that is what a lion does. the same way if someone gets in your face, you will react by pushing them away. or if you annoy a bee then it will sting you. there is always a reason an animal will do something and the reason we have dog trainer's is to understand why the animal is exhibiting that behaviour in that specific circumstance (even if no one is up in their face) and they work to train them properly. they are not vicious animals by nature and they can easily be taught how to behave. the difference between humans is that we cognitively learn right and wrong pretty early on, but dogs aren't the same, so you cannot expect a dog to behave as maturely as a human who is far superior intellectually."
unpopularopinion,fewa74f,t3_eqqm9i,1579407443.0,"although humans aren't monogamous by nature, you have to remember that humans are also not robots and that we have emotions and thoughts separate to what is innate. a lot of people have a need for romance and choose monogamy based on the morals and philosophies they have followed throughout their life. it's pretty common now that most people want to feel special and that monogamy is successful in achieving that. and with only prioritizing sex, love becomes futile and it's a pretty miserable existence without experiencing love outside of familial obligation. 

i believe that moving away from relationships to hook up culture is only going to cause problems in society. people who care less, people who are more selfish, a lack of growth by not being able to share a special life experience strictly with one other individual. although i don't have a general issue with hook up culture, and i believe it is a period of life that nearly everyone will go through, i don't think it should be the primary way."

rant,feguprz,t3_eozhyq,1579102959.0,"damn i mostly see people bragging about how miserable their life is, like a competition of unfortunateness"
infp,fegu68n,t3_ep1jon,1579102610.0,"YES. COMPLETELY. i believe this is why i'm drawn to acting. i want to be all these different people, i want to live all these different lives and discover all these different feelings. i want to be everywhere and do everything, but i think with such wide and hopeful dreams comes the crushing sensation of being overwhelmed. you start asking, how? how do i achieve this, is it even possible? why should it even be me? what could i possibly do? i want to do all these things but who says i have the ability to. i've always pondered the purpose of life. 

i tend to go with the theory that everything happens for a reason and it's part of a bigger picture. but it doesn't stop the fact that i know i will strive for all these things in life and yet we'll all end up in the same place; dead. what makes anything worth it? well yeah it's the little moments. playing with dogs, hanging out with friends, watching a sunset, eating good food... because for these moments i don't have to think of any purpose, i'm just there enjoying it. i don't know why i'm here or what i'm supposed to do, but if i'm here already, what's the point of doing nothing? i am not here to fulfil anything other that what i desire at any given moment. 

try to look at it from the existentialist point of view. a knife is created for cutting. it's essence precedes it's existence. with humans, it's the opposite. we are not created with any purpose, rather we are created, and then it is up to us what we choose to have our purpose be. look at some of the stuff jean paul sartre says. in general, i think looking at different philosophies and schools of life really help put things into perspective. there's a wonderful channel on youtube called pursuit of wonder that makes excellent videos about stuff like this"
infp,fegt4fo,t3_ep1p2z,1579101928.0,"i look at it in the sense that we've all got our own personal issues. there's this idea that we should love someone unconditionally for simply being themselves however they are, but the thing is that we get into these relationships or we fall in love with people for the things they have to offer for us. whether it be that they are the kindest person you met, or the funniest, or whatnot. without these qualities that draw you specifically to them, what reason do you have to be in love with them? 

if someone starts to become different, letting their insecurities take over in a negative and harmful way, it's unfair to expect someone to still feel the same. i think support is still important, but it's really difficult to love someone when they make it seem like there shouldn't be anything to love about them. it's completely ok to get down sometimes and need someone to love you and support you, but all in all if you aren't able to love yourself on your own, you become dependant on another person to show you this love and make you feel worthy and that's where it becomes unhealthy and dangerous. 

i love my partner and they are free to come to me whenever they need and i will always support them, but there are just some things that we need to be independent in. they cannot base their whole life worth and being on me. so the way i see it, loving yourself first is about independency."
ChoosingBeggars,fegs075,t3_eow5cl,1579101179.0,"i have a similar story to this. i worked at a cafe and it was just me and another girl working that shift. a young woman orders some cold drink (i don't even remember what it was exactly) and asks for regular milk in it. i'm also really anxious and i was new so i was really wary about not fucking up orders. i had to confirm to her 3 times that this was the drink she wanted and the other girl working could hear it on the headset too.

 i make her drink and give it to her and she says ""this is with soy milk right?"" and i was like ""no, it's just the regular drink you ordered"" and she's like ""i ASKED for soy milk."" i know for a fact she didn't but ok, the most i could do is just remake her drink so i say ""i can remake it for you with soy milk"" and she goes ""ugh no it's fine i'm gonna be late anyway. but next time, it's on the house ok?"" and i literally didn't even know what to say so i just said ok because she was holding up the line. i turn to my coworker and i was like, ""you heard her order the regular drink right?"" and she confirmed i was right.

 dis bitch was acting like it was so inconvenient for her to have received a drink that wasn't made with soy milk when she ordered it like that, yet when i offer to remake the drink she refuses because how else will she try to get a free drink next time?"

relationship_advice,fegmn22,t1_fefsz25,1579097360.0,"i don't think you should deny it. you can't stay in a relationship because you've been together for a long time and you know her family. relationships are about love and finding the person you actually want to spend the rest of your life with, not out of convenience. pursue the one your heart desires and forget about the pressures of any other factor because they don't matter when it comes to this decision"
relationship_advice,fefsj9k,t3_eoxmaj,1579063900.0,"i personally wouldn't see this as an issue. the fact is that they broke up for a reason. two people can still have love for each other and support each other but not be in love, and realize that a relationship isn't right for them. he's chosen to be with you, so why are you worried?"
relationship_advice,fefs9zf,t3_eoxjg9,1579063688.0,"goddamn... well i mean it's gonna suck a lot but you're definitely more in love with this girl than your gf so it's pretty clear you need to end your relationship. this is also someone you can really be with, not just distance. it really does fucking suck, i know. but if this is the perfect girl for you (in your opinion) it means that your gf is not the perfect girl for you so what's the point in being with her over this new girl? i think you just need to be honest and maybe to her you'll be the piece of shit, but what matters most is to make a decision that makes you happy. and you never know, maybe your gf is also unhappy in your relationship and wants to end it. the good thing is you didn't cheat, but if you go on without being open and honest, then it starts to get into the emotional cheating territory. i think it's really important that partners can talk openly and freely without judgement even if they are having doubts about their relationship"

offmychest,fefrryo,t3_eoxg9q,1579063291.0,"that's not really an indication of anything. if you feel beautiful, then that's all that matters. as nice as we wanna feel that people find us so irresistible they will come up to us, more often that not, it's guys who think they can get the girl easy, it's not really about looking at a girl and being like ""wow she's beautiful. i simply must go up to her and get her number and court her"", it's more like ""damn i'm gonna try to smash that"" which isn't really about beauty and shouldn't be something to strive for. someone will come along and see your beauty too, don't compare yourself to other girls because it's incomparable. i've seen beautiful girls stand side by side and although they look completely different, i couldn't say which one was more beautiful. probably the guys who find you attractive are the introverts who want to date you but are too shy to say it lol"
unpopularopinion,fefrgch,t3_eoxgvc,1579063042.0,"i mean you could say the same thing about a long term relationship, break up doesn't exist if you've committed yourself monogamously to this person, but marriage is mostly just legal stuff anyway. some people legally get divorced (for financial reasons) but are still together. i don't think you can do anything with 100% and say there is no possibility of the opposite. i can love you to the moon and back but i cannot foresee the future. you can't deny that failure exists if success is achievable"
