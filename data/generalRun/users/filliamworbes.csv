runescape,fgmk3cq,t3_ezapba,1580926181.0,What is the new high intensity mining? Is it like old school 3 tick mining or something or what? Cause I would argue rockportunities is about like fishing frenzy in effort doctor have it not be best ore gain or best xp seems counter intuitive tbf.
runescape,fggt0ia,t1_fggs953,1580768897.0,As u/frankerz1 posted originally the ratio between the two skills so if you were to seek levels beyond 99 you would need 1 bil mining for the 200 mil smithing with corrupted ore method.

OldSchoolCool,ffgrf1p,t1_ffghp3e,1579913145.0,"Slot of what I was able to read about the camps suggests that mainly the people unable to work (or handicapped, permanently ill, criminal or anti-social) were executed. The camps were not originally designed for Mass genocide but rather slave labor for the Nazi war, so gas Chambers were added to ease the operation along. 
HEY EVERYONE INSTEAD OF US THREATENING YOU WITH YOU LIVES AND THEN KILLING YOU IN FRONT OF EVERYONE ELSE TODAY I WAS THINKING YOU ALL GET SHOWERS! ALSO ALL JEWS MUST SHOWER. . . DOCTORS ORDERS!!!
Wiki also made note of many people dying before arriving at the camps in rail cars due to poor treatment (lack of water, season temperatures etc.) Anyways I read your comment and felt like I should share, but not to say you're wrong just to share the history."

runescape,fe4fvts,t1_fe3ywgd,1578858845.0,"Instead of just sweeping old content under the rug of out leveling it and literally never seeing it again having a way to revisit empowered low level Slayer monsters for either parts to make Slayer specific perks or put them all together for a Slayer chest like with raptor. IDK the corrupt monsters feel pretty lame where as the spulgazers that are a dungoneering mob are actually a blast to train on, for a reference in a side by side comparison. And the xp can be whatever is fair for the lvl and other requirements needed no need to be getting 40k xp drops during non bxpwe cause reasons."
runescape,fdwebej,t1_fdtseu2,1578757817.0,"No living wyverns have some serious fore power in all three styles. There isn't any easy way to get there. Doing a whole task in one trip is a lot more difficult than most bossing and if you have to tell the only ""close"" arrival point is a 99 dung cape tele to like ice warriors. Conclusion they are fun as at mammoths but the living wyverns are too inconvenient to farm unlike other more mainstream Slayer mobs."
