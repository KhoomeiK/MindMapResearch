clevercomebacks,fefs0v8,t1_fef9stl,1579063489.0,"The catholic church was just an example of one church. Anything can become a crutch to avoid critical thinking. I agree with you that religion is often the crutch of choice. People's problems are the responsibility of people to address, but people like to blame invisible men like God, demons, or pixies- unfortunately. Most major religions are used as an excuse for violence, hate, and war- also unfortunate since religions always have peace as a core value. Love thy brother and such. Bottom line is sometimes people are bastards. Religions generally aren't, but they are used inappropriately by bastards to justify why they ought to be bastards. Speaking of bastards... yes, Trump is a bastard."

clevercomebacks,fef4pw5,t1_feeu1d4,1579048127.0,"Actually the Catholic church admits freely that many of the stories in the bible are allegorical in nature, not meant to be taken literally- I.E. they are basically fables- but maintains that this doesn't detract from their value. I'm sure other religions do so as well, but I'm not as familiar with them. Don't let the truth get in the way of a good story. 

Whether a person believes in monotheism is a matter for the individual in question. I wouldn't hazard a guess as to what they feel validated their faith."

clevercomebacks,feefzu7,t3_eonpit,1579032984.0,"Several of these type of passages from the bible have been proven to be interpolations added during the middle ages. Not sure about this one, but I always look at these quotes with suspicion because of that."
