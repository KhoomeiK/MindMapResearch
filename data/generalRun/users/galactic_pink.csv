Was also my neighbor. On a dead end street. As if Iâ€™d never see it.  
  
  
  
Whenever I asked her about it, she got really hostile. While I was taking pictures of her license plate, she charged me to hit me - (I am a good deal smaller than her) she missed, and *one* hit in self-defense resulted in me breaking her jaw.   
  
  
Be cautious. Iâ€™m now facing charges for protecting myself in the midst of documenting damage to my vehicle lol. 
  
  
When the police came, they told me that I should have filed a police report the day that the incident happened. Take as many pictures as possible of both vehicles, and submit them to your insurance company."

I didnâ€™t cry or anything, it just made me feel weird, and sad. Chester was an amazing vocalist, he sang the words we could not speak. Iâ€™m from the Pittsburgh area, and only one year younger - so I followed Mac Millerâ€™s growth. His spiral towards death was common to this area, but still shocking nonetheless.  
  
  
  
Steve Irwin was also a bummer. He was so genuine."
