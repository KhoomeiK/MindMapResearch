TopsAndBottoms,ffi920b,t1_ff5hqqu,1579968218.0,Wow...didn't realize it was this rare.  My bf and i (both bi) do this almost every time...vary rare for us not to both top and bottom during playtime.  I love the feeling of getting pounded and when he finishes love turning him over and taking him.  Only drawback is it takes a lot of time.

cats,fcqqtyt,t3_eiid9v,1577890750.0,How old is your cat?  We took in a stray and when we moved kept him indoors and he really didnt like it.  He was about 2 and we ended up adopting another cat...kitten actually and it actually fixed everything.  Minx had someone to keep him occupied and to care for.  They remained best buds for over 15 years.
cats,fcqq7aj,t3_eiij84,1577890434.0,Cute....is he yours or a stray?
cats,fcqq0nx,t3_eiiqnu,1577890343.0,Hi Lucy!!!
cats,fcqohju,t1_fcotzum,1577889576.0,It is not that it will loose the ability to hunt just that it will become accustomed to having a ready supply of food and if that stops it has to adjust back to foraging.  It may take time to gain its trust but it is a great feeling to rescue a homeless cat.
cats,fcpamrt,t3_eie844,1577856314.0,Thanks for rescuing him

cats,fcoerwd,t3_ei9b8u,1577830481.0,Sorry you went through this but you showed him love and kindness when most of the world wouldn't do so.  You gave your heart to him and you both had a better life because of it.  Thank you for caring for him.
cats,fcoeh2s,t3_ei9g9p,1577830266.0,It can take a long time and is different for each cat.  Just be patient and if you start feeding it please continue to do so as it will become accustomed and dependent on you.  One of our rescues came in after 4 days but he was probably a lost cat that was used to people.  Our other took 6 months but he was a feral and only decided to come in when it got really cold.  Both are absolute cuddle bugs now....rescue cats are the best.  Good luck.
cats,fcodw25,t3_ei9hu2,1577829854.0,I would vote for him
cats,fcnw6kh,t3_ei7bnx,1577819656.0,Sorry for your loss he was a beautiful cat.  I know it doesn't make it easier but at least he didn't suffer and he knew you loved him.
