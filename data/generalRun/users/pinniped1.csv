There's another where I can only reliably use Helm.  And one where I only use Lava.  #9 requires a good Earth or BW - plus maybe a little help from the wind.

That leaves #1 and #2 where you can use any serviceable driver.  You need a good Moon shot, sometimes dunkable sometimes not.

I don't know much about guns, but I went to an event a few years ago that had a small range and a guy showing people how to use .22 pistols.  Even those tiny guns...the dude was super serious about safety before you got to shoot.  But with an air gun it's just here ya go, have at it..."
