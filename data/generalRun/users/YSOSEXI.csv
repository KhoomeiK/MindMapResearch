It is usually worse if the tenant dries clothes in the house on racks because they do not have an electrical vented drier. I fitted a humidifier in a property last week and in the first day it took 9 pints of water, the 2nd 4 pints and then none after that. When cooking, showering, bathing you need to crack open the windows.
Each room should have a vent, ask the landlord to fit a PIV home ventilator."
