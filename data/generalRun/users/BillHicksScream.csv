 There are people warning that this is going to be a duplication of 1972 when the democrats gave the American people exactly what they wanted:  an anti-war candidate.  Nixon had lied and said he had a secret plan to end the war, (sound familiar?).  By 1972 the public knew that he had been secretly bombing without Congress's authority both Cambodia and Laos.



Yet the public turned around & elected Nixon in a landslide.

Why Amazon paid no Federal taxes *in 2018*:

This discusses it:
https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/aqp9zw/amazon_will_pay_a_whopping_0_in_federal_taxes_on/


First,  Amazon did not turn a profit for a very long time.  Yet people continue to invest in it because they believed that would it would eventually turn a profit.  It is a wildly overvalued company as the result.  People have been throwing money at it and Amazon has been investing it.  The stock price stays very high. Jeff Bezos is very rich *on paper*.



 Many large institutional investors also see the larger economic benefits of the cloud computing structure its building  so they're investing in one company *so that it will benefit other investments elsewhere.*

From 2011 - 2018 *It spent $160 billion dollars expanding.*.

It lost money every year.  It covered those losses because investors kept throwing money at it.


*In 2017 it turned a profit finally. ~6 billion.  It paid no taxes because it was able to apply its losses from previous years...and reinvested those prophets in itself.


In 2018, It had 11 billion in profits on 200 billion dollars in sales. 

* *That's a ~5% profit margin*

* It also paid its employees their stock income. *~ 1 billion dollars*.  You want companies to pay their employees part of the profits?  *That's what Amazon did.* Because a huge portion of employee compensation is in the form of stock RSU's.   The employee signs a new contract, part of the compensation is in a form of stock option, and the company has to pay out that stock option within a few years   So Amazon had been putting money aside as well in order to pay on those stock options.



* Amazon then reinvested the rest of the profits back into the company. *The tax code is designed to do this, to encourage companies to not simply take the money and run, but continue to build.*

It's still paid state taxes, sales taxes, employee taxes & international taxes.  In previous years it had paid billions of dollars in taxes.


 So rather than giving the government money, it spent money building the company, hiring more people *& sharing profits with employees*.


* One reason it did not pay any taxes, is precisely because Trump lowered the tax rate from 35% to 21%.*

That someone is usually (and statistically) someone who has produced something or offers a service of value for a profit intent. The government spending does not have a multiplier effect of 5 to 7 times, that is mathematically impossible since (as I said above) before they can spend $1 they must take it from someone else. Private spending has a multiplier effect far greater than anything that the government can create. 


 Then why are Republican budgets & debt so much bigger?   Because they know that lots of government spending stimulates the economy.  


 Replace the word government with the word bank in the above statement.  A bank does not make anything either.


 Banks redistribute too..& get money from the Fed.

They take that money & from their own investments, but it still redistributing money without actually producing anything.

It's more efficient than communism, because you have individuals in their own communities decentralized along with a population of individuals incentivized to start their own business when they see a product/service niche that's missing or they decidr that they can make a better product in an existing market.



 Now you can't simply print money, you have to have a trade  economy where fresh amounts of money are introduced into the economy from outside as well.


 Which is why being a country abundant in natural resources like the USA is important.



 None of your economics videos are going to talk about certain resource advantages that the United States has & they're not going to admit that government spending provides a stabilizing force against the destabilizing effects of rapid economic change.



Because those videos are basically propaganda that wants to ignore some major parts of economics. (And we haven't even begun to discuss defense in war spending stimulation). In case you didn't notice, my training was as an economist.



It's a complex soup. Under Brezhnev, the economy of the Soviet Union grew but not efficiently because a centralized economy is not anywhere as productive.  Its missing all the unique products & services niches that people create because they think there is a demand.  There's less incentive to work harder in communism and the amount of work that you do is controlled anyways. Communism ""works"" but not very well at all.  It is a failed economic system because everything is controlled and the population is not motivated.   Like us, they had a lot of natural resources & they sold them to other countries & this brought money into the country. We do the exact same thing here, except with lots of products alongside our natural resources... and its decentralized so that new ideas and the individual motivations of both consumers and creators are free to do their thing.







But the multiplier effect of government spending is still working. It's literally why the term exists:

https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-economics/chapter/introduction-to-fiscal-policy/






All of those videos don't talk about the banks getting money from the Fed, which monitors the economy to determine how much *new* money should be injected into the economy via banks & recommendations on government spending.





At this point, they loan money to the banks so low that it's practically free.  At the same time as the rates charge for borrowing money from The Fed dropped to insignificant, Interest rates for credit cards have skyrocketed. This is literally taking money out of people's pocket for people who are borrowing money for free.  This is a drag on the local economies because people are spending more on interest.   That interest is being funneled to a central location which then redistributes the money in investments & loans.


  But it still is taking money out of the local economy now... Because banking is no longer local and boring, but internatonal and dynamic which is why we have these great big towers but the people belief beneath the towers can't afford rent.



 This is one reason why people are struggling. Too much money is being taken out of their communities because banking is no longer local and boring.


 And the banks of created this great system were yes when they extend massive loans to people be it in the form of a housing loan a credit card or an actual business opportunity coming the economy expands further faster.....



.... But then it crashes, ecause that's not sustainable.   It turns out extending two home loans to a bartender in Vegas only works for a few years.


 


It's why we have crashes once again, despite not having them for decades when we had greater control over the banking system as a part of the economy, not the controlling factor in the economy.

And since many Republican districts are not very good at attracting dynamic new industries & services,  they rely on government spending to keep themselves afloat.


 Which is why on average red States spend less in taxes than they receive while blue States especially blue districts get less in taxes than they put into the system.

I wonder where your kind was during the Bush era, when that administration was keeping the cost of the war off the books, which was the 1st thing Obama put back after getting elected. For some reason dishonest economists thought that they could then add that spending under Obama, even though it actually occurred under George Bush.


 Yet like Clinton, he was still able to get that deficit under control very quickly.


 Money is money.   Now you can't simply print money.  You have to have a strong economy that actually makes things and trades them with another country & you can't just trade inside of a country (A fantasy of many trump voters). That's not sustainable either.

 And so the workers vote for the Republican who's been bought by the CEO.

  And now the CEO has more money that she's not going to spend in your community...and you now have 20 less workers who are no longer spending money in your community...with a multiplier effect as they spend their paychecks.

I took my niece to see  SW: TLJ with the most up to date screens & sounds after a week long river trip looking for wild Orang.  Yes, we paid for carbon offsets to travel. Solutions are out there

news,ffv2ou5,t1_fftif3h,1580254290.0,">Most of the initiatives to combat climate change COST money and slow the economy, not make money for it. That is one of many reasons why the market share is drifting eastwards

The market share is not the economy. Markets are what matters first: people making & selling & getting paid.


Money spent on cleaner manufacturing methods *is money being spent in the economy*.

The same as buying raw materials. The same as hiring a security company to wire & respond at night if someone breaks in.
The same as Defense. The same as Social Security. Money is money. MONEY IS MONEY. 

""But the investors having more money ain't stealing! They spend it, they invest it!*

So do the 3 Green Workers.  *Paychecks & goods spent & bought in their community*. Everything they buy/invest in *trickles upward*.  The green products are developed by private enterprise. The goods inspectors use to monitor compliance *are made by private enterprise*.  Their services *save money*, acting as a market pressure just like a customer for a better, cleaner product & responsible behavior.  *Every spill, avoided, every salmonella outbreak stopped quickly, every molecule of CO^2 scrubbed *saves money & pays for itself*.


That's right - this ain't the ignorance of Fox Business. *My degree is in economics.*


The money is not wasted. Its being spent & providing stability...

...investors just have to find it. Its out there & the market is doing its thing with it.  More money is moving around. *That's better for the economy.*

* *Investors are just one layer away from profiting off it.*


 Big investors make big mistakes & remove money too quickly from wider circulation. They jump from company to company, preventing many a business from establishing itself long term.  We don't notice this in your precious ""market share"" because those are just numbers & *we are over extending credit to consumers*. This fuels boom growth in an Amazon World, but the reality is in our communities, our lives, & the lack of savings.





Money is Money.  The model now is *Give money to large investors by tax cuts*.
This is *inefficient*.  Money needs to move around.


Ignoring these issues *depresses the belief of citizens in business, democracy & society.* This is a drag on worker enthusiasm. That costs both money & social stability.


*A factory in Minnesota* employs 100 workers. Green upgrades & inspectors require 3 workers.  The owners of the factory, who live in Connecticut, register the company in Florida & park the income at a bank in Chicago...petition politicians for changes using lobbyists in North Carolina.  *The local economy around the factory no longer has the income from the three Green Workers*, but the owners now have more.


*That's not efficient.*  That's immoral."
