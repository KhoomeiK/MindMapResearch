Filmmakers,fgkqqoe,t1_fgjh1ar,1580871517.0,"The budget was around 65 mill if online sources are correct.
The movie in itself isn’t heavily based on cgi but I imagine making the subtle changes in architecture and having it be good and detailed as possible is a good chunk of the budget. Partly because there are lots of moving parts in Hollywood and you’re under deadlines. It’s not cheap. Probably 5-10 mill. It’s just a random ass number I’m throwing at it could be less or more buts nothing under a million that’s forsure.

Edit: clarity, I’m talking about cgi on the aesthetic of the film In it’s entirety. Not specifically this scene.

ufc,fgj5iz3,t1_fghnmed,1580837377.0,I agree with this 100. He coast in a lot of fights he doesn’t want to take risk. Comes with the territory of being the reigning champ I suppose.

You’re saying it’s not relevant that he already cleaned out the division except it is relevant and will always be relevant when trying to gauge the competition.no need to be salty about it and act like Jon isn’t holding down the division.

I’m sure the extension is very low risk with many incentives. No argument there. Which is exactly why you sign someone like him."
DynastyFF,fgihukt,t1_fgihmis,1580822092.0,"Forsure he’s talented enough and colts believe in him enough to extend him. Also depends on what you consider a jag too. Murray has had a solid productive 6 year career thus far. A jag imo would be Alex Collins or Chris ivory type( one 1 Kseason in a 9 year career. I have no shortage of examples.) while someone like Murray was productive throughout his seasons.

I think two back to back 1k seasons and a contract extension deserves some recognition in dynasty formats. Others have pointed out he’s not a pass catcher but I disagree. He was used in the passing game plenty his first season. Seems to be an oc thing."

There’s a lot of debate in Muslim culture between fundamentalist, and modernist. Different sects with different beliefs etc. there’s lots of politics involved in it as well so lots of terrorist groups that are formed under the guise of  sharia law etc.  how many average Americans do you expect to know that blowing yourself up and inheriting virgins is a lot of bullshit made up by a guy on opioids to attract followers?

That fact that your a Christian means you believe in a book full of stolen writings and contradictions and supposedly base your life on those beliefs.  Certainly it’s illogical to say there is no god or at the very least an architect to all this. It’s also illogical to claim the Bible as source of truth and say all other things are evil. It’s been proven that the Bible has stolen stories from other religions. The story of Christ was stolen the 12 disciples represent the 12 zodiacs. The original Hebrew words have been changed.. etc the list goes on.  I’m ok with people being good people and I’m glad that Christianity can give certain people basic rules to live a good life but it takes away from many aspects of a well rounded person.  My point though, is many things in the Bible are proven to be not true or align with what we are told. Truth and wisdom are certainly in there but requires thinking beyond the structure of this so called religion. The idea of Jesus is literally telling you that religion is bullshit I mean we don’t have to get into semantics ’s but I think you’ll get my point overall."

DynastyFF,fg1ovx6,t1_fg1ojua,1580431030.0,Ah ok well this better explains your point of view because I definitely agree with this assessment overall.
DynastyFF,fg1k4gi,t1_fg1iyb4,1580428542.0,"My point is Alex Collins was never a home run kinda guy in Baltimore he got volume and some goal line work. Mack literally got his career started by making huge plays in limited work. That’s why he became the starter because he can run for a 60 yard td on any given play. I’ll agree that he lack receiving skills although I’m not 100 percent sure how much of that is due to colts oc. 
But even then Collins wasn’t a JAG he was slated to be the starter. He got hurt then suspended and waived. 

On top of that Mack has 1000 yards and ten tds
And 1100 yards and 8 tds averaging 4.8 ypc and 4.4 ypc his first two seasons as a starter and is only 23. 

So I don’t understand the comparison or how you can call Mack JAG. Mack brings a lot of value to the Colts, and if they waived him there will be plenty of teams looking to obtain him. That doesn’t make him a stud but worth owning. I suppose you’re just high on Wilkins.

Edit: and on another note Mack’s rookie year he had 225 yards receiving on 10.7 ypc. They had a different oc that year so he can clearly carve out a role in the passing game."
