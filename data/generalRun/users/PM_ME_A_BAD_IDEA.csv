How long does it take to complete one of these California checks? Because one of the big problems we see today is people committing crimes with weapons they've owned for years or before they committed more serious offenses. If I buy a gun and some ammo, pass a background, but then I rape someone a while later, and then later on I try to buy more ammo, that additional check could stop me or at the very least, make it harder for me to arm myself. 

This is also why we absolutely need registries. If you're convicted of a violent felony, I want all your guns confiscated. It's absurd to me that you can get away with keeping guns but you can't vote after you get out. Yes, I know felons aren't able to purchase guns (except in private sales) after a conviction, but that doesn't help with guns they already had."

Third, it's a completely valid point to discuss, because the nature of these attacks cause people to feel unsafe in public schools, which again, in the first world, is a largely American problem.

Now that we have a president that is actively obstructing Justice and bragging about it? Most of them are right behind him, cheering him on.
