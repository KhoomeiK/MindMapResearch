Oscars_SF,ffs86ir,t3_euwesu,1580175515.0,Are any of the nominations really upbeat movies though? Besides like Jojo Rabbit and maybe Ford v Ferrari. Most are dark.
Kanye,ffs3utf,t3_eupcac,1580172469.0,The good Kanye is bringing to this world is honestly incredible. I’m really proud of where he’s at now.
love,ffpkq6y,t3_euf80k,1580097414.0,Love can definitely be real without intimacy. It’s pretty obvious to me that your dick is in love with her and your mind is in like with her. If you really love her you’ll respect her religion and personal beliefs.

movies,ffi6egy,t1_ffhtip4,1579966309.0,"While you’re somewhat right that movies will get better reviews if they have award winning directors and actors in it, there’s a simple answer for that: it’s because they add quality to the movie.

And don’t act like Scorsese hasn’t gotten shit reviews. Gangs of New York is a 7.5/10 on IMDB, and that was released well after his most famous films. 7.5 isn’t a bad score, but for Scorsese, it is.

The Irishman definitely is not a pile of shit. I agree the pacing is a little slow at times, but it’s a movie about an old guy recalling his life. Of course he adds every detail under the sun. Kind of adds to the charm in my opinion."
