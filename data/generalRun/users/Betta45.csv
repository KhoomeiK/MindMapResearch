C25K,ffachl7,t3_es0rwn,1579732294.0,"I did the whole program on a treadmill. Never got the app. I taped a note with the walk/jog splits on it, because doing math in my head while jogging was too hard. I didn’t care about my heart rate, inclines, distance...I was just jogging for time. Now I don’t care about time, but I jog to hit 3 miles. I jog an 11:16 minute mile, according to the treadmill. On the slower side, but I’m fine with that. Do what feels comfortable for you. Play around with it. Don’t wear yourself out on your brisk 5 minute warm-up walk though."

brexit,fepcyop,t1_fegkl20,1579317467.0,"I believe this is a big threat the Sussexes present: exposure of royal wealth.  At the rate the Sussexes are spending money, they will blow through Harry’s money quickly. Which I agree, is public money. Almost all the royal money is public money. The question is, how much money is the public willing to pay to support the HoS and family? There is that perennial lie that the RF only costs each Britton a pound a year, or something like that, and that they bring in more money from tourism than they cost. I bet the average tourist in London doesn’t know what the Court Circular is, so don’t tell me the tourists are there to see the royals. But I digress. The RF has been purposefully vague on their income. I only learned about the SG reserve fund a few months ago.

While I think the case can be made for stripping the Sussexes of their property (on loan) and money from the Sovereign Grant, you probably couldn’t get what’s left of Harry’s inheritance. It will also be hard to convince Charles to cut them off financially, since he is the one supporting them. The Queen didn’t cut off any of her kids. While Andrew has been removed from the Sovereign Grant, he still gets money from the Duchy of Lancaster. Even Beatrice and Eugenie, who are part-time royals, get money from the Queen through Andrew. They live at the palaces and get security when doing royal work (I believe, I may be wrong). 

The main issue for the future is to educate the public about the duchies and crown lands. Charles has told the public over the years that the duchies and crown lands are actually owned by the royals, when they are not. Just in case the monarchy fails, he is hoping the public will let the royals have that land. And this is why a free press is so vital. They exposed the Paradise Papers, the SG reserve fund, and Andrew’s shady side deals. All of this is coming to light again now that the Sussexes have said they want out.

And the current royals need to learn this ugly lesson about ‘spares’.  Margaret, Andrew, and Harry have all caused big problems. Teach Charlotte and Louis that they can be working royals, but their kids cannot, and they will never have as much money or influence as George, and if they don’t like it they can stop being royals and get jobs."
MeghanMarkle,fep95lt,t1_fefvswy,1579314930.0,"Given the amount of hyperbole on this site regarding Meghan and the alleged story of Camilla being pelted with bread rolls, it was natural to conclude your metaphor was intended as fact. And yes, less than a minute of Googling would reveal the story as true or false, as such a thing would be big news. And I had a wonderful few days darling. Cheers!"
C25K,fejsz3m,t3_epfgux,1579185099.0,"My biggest lesson in this program was to slow down. I was trying to run a 10 minute mile throughout the program, but I couldn’t sustain it past 10-15 minutes, and then I’d be so out of breath I had to walk. I have to keep reminding myself that it is ok to jog slowly, it is the only way I can jog for longer amounts of time. Plus, even short and slow regular jogs are healthy.

MeghanMarkle,feeta02,t1_febp3my,1579040738.0,"When did she have rotten tomatoes thrown at her? I’ve followed the RF for decades, and I’ve followed her and Harry closely since the beginning. I read the British newspapers almost daily and I’ve never heard this. I have also never read of her baby being called a monkey. I’ve read a few racist comments to articles about her, but nothing of this level! The worst public treatment those two have gotten is being booed (the Albert Hall comes to mind.) I just Googled these two claims and found nothing. These claims are fictitious."
C25K,fe3kra2,t3_encpcz,1578850208.0,"I used glucosamine, but took ibuprofen when it was bad. Changing my running posture and pace, really thinking about my form as I jogged, made it go away. Also good shoes. And running on a treadmill. My area is all concrete roads and sidewalks, and I’m envious of joggers I see enjoying the weather when I can only jog indoors. Le sigh."

asoiaf,fe35o48,t3_ennrl6,1578846136.0,Subtle pressure. It is how bareback horse riders control horses. It is how the lead dancer (traditionally male) in a couple steers the pair around the dance floor. And magical mental connections...blah blah blah.
brexit,fds4xv3,t3_emv9rk,1578694447.0,"I’m pretty sure H&M are leaving because they weren’t the stars of the royal family. They don’t want to be supporting players, so they quit.

freefolk,fdpdrn7,t1_fdoifh2,1578626053.0,"If he wanted to raise his child in peace and privacy, he could easily do that. Reject the titles, take his inheritance, and live somewhere quietly and don’t engage the press. But that isn’t what they are doing. They want to be a public couple on their own terms: taking taxpayer money, keeping the taxpayer funded house, keeping taxpayer funded security, keeping taxpayer funded staff, but not actually work for the taxpayers. Oh, and merchandise the heck of their titles. They both want fame. They are not leaving the royal family for a quiet private life. This is a public tantrum that the royal family didn’t allow them to take center stage, and a pivot to a money-making lifestyle trading on their royal status."

MeghanMarkle,fdlehml,t1_fdl56e1,1578522294.0,"They are hoping to earn money through their foundation, which still isn’t fully set up I believe. But Meghan and Harry are the directors, which means most donations can go to their pockets as salary (only 5% has to go to charity). Disney donated around $3 million at the Lion King premier. They also have copyrighted photos and videos, and will start charging for public speaking or appearances. But they will never make more money than they were given living off the British taxpayers. This will backfire. They are not popular enough here to raise the kind of money they want."
