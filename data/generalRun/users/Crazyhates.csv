todayilearned,ffmntj0,t1_ffmar2t,1580057067.0,This happened at an airline company I work at. Seniors got moved from their offices to cubes. All the basic cubes with 5-6ft partitions got changed into open cubes where it's easy to see everyone around you. You can look at  the person across from you in the face while your neighbor can do the same to you. It's nerve-wracking. I don't think I met a single person who wasn't pissed and I actually see more people working from home than ever before. Open concept offices are an antiquated practice that took roots from poor work ethics and they have no place in a modern office.

People have asked for more 4* dragons, but I feel that if they buffed the event dragons to be equivalent or slightly better than a MUB 4* would be good enough."

MonsterHunterWorld,fdnwmes,t3_emcsom,1578594337.0,"I'm not even sure. If we take this a bit further and look into some real history, there are no concrete records of shields being used in the dominant hand when wielded with a weapon. 

Sheilds are simply made to deflect and block attacks with their round, domelike surfaces deflecting and redirecting the force of the strikes so that the weilder feels minimal forces meaning that the dexterity and strength often provided by the dominant hand is not necessary. One could assume that a trained fighter would know how to use a shield regardless of the arm its on/held, but the same cannot be said of a weapon. A dominant or non-dominant arm does not make as much a difference when defending with a shield, however it does make a huge difference when it comes to the handling of the weapon.

Taking all that into account. Everyone in the MH universe who fights with a shield must be either left handed or that is customary of their culture."
MonsterHunterWorld,fdki122,t1_fdjlnj5,1578504267.0,"Seeing as how preloading is only available to those who pre-ordered, I have no idea how you were able to type any of this and believe what came of it.

There is no trick to boost numbers, those who preload have already spent their money to play. They already have the numbers. The only thing that's happening from preloading is allowing people to play the game when it's released, a convenience to everyone involved. Now Capcom has to deal with not only their download servers getting hit very hard tomorrow, but also the game play servers as well. It was a dumb move for them to make."
MonsterHunterWorld,fdkheu2,t3_elviwa,1578503934.0,"Take your time. No need to rush in. Study the monster for a while in the beginning of the fight, playing conservatively to learn moments to strike. As someone who uses Lance and Hammer, their speed forced me to change my approach to one that is more calculated and patient. In some cases you have 50min, knowing that, it's okay to take your time. Bring the appropriate decos, equips, and weapons and always have a farcaster ready.

This subreddit loves to push the whole dps only meta deal, but when solo survival is key as you can't do damage or clear when you're dead. Building defensively is okay until you truly know how to handle your enemy."

 Even for new players I'd advise to skip it, because although the units involved are good at 70mc, it would take a new player a long time to even amass the resources to invest to that degree. Especially considering they could save their Wyrmite for upcoming banners in which units would possibly be good out the box without that level of investment."
