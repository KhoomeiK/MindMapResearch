In the past I did a year of weight training using mostly machines + dumbbells.

Started doing a small kettlebell/bodyweight circuit this week, to hopefully get a bit stronger and prevent injury + why not right?

Pull ups, deadlift, swings, rows. May add get ups next week. I have a bad ish arm from an armbar so for the rows I'm only doing 25lb and same with the swings. 40lb for deadlift. Haven't worked out rep numbers yet I just circuited this for an hour until class started. I'd estimate probably did 3x10s for most by the end of it.

What do you guys think, anything I should add? I may only be able to do this 2-3 times a week with how often I train bjj so I hope to not necessarily ""see"" results but if I stick to it do you think it will help me out or is that too low a weight to do anything for me
