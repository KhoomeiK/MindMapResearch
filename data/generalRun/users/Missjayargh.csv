intermittentfasting,ffn3pwi,t3_eua2mc,1580061717.0,I dunno my meds have made it so I don’t have an appetite anymore and I’m for sure not storing fat.
BipolarReddit,ffn3k21,t1_ffmu27z,1580061661.0,"I have an apt with her tomorrow. The part that sucks is the meds I have left are all the big weight gainers and I don’t want to gain more weight. I gained *some* weight on abilify and even though I was stable I started to socially isolate. Didn’t fit in my clothes and didn’t feel like I deserved to be seen because I felt gross. I’m aware I have body dysmorphia but that doesn’t make it any easier to accept my body because I know my view is distorted  and my meds don’t help with that. What’s the point of being “stable” if I don’t feel worthy of love and withdrawal entirely from society? 

My current meds make me asexual, which is also stressful. I can’t even tell if I’m attracted to anyone anymore and not even porn can get me aroused. (Not because Im desensitized). I’m single and young and have no reason to socialize or date because what’s the point? Go home with someone who maybe (?) is attractive and have painful sex and never cum? It’s like... it shouldn’t be this hard to just be a person.

I’ve been researching ketamine treatments and mushrooms. I’ve had two docs say small dose of mushrooms would be ok for me since I don’t have psychosis history. But like, it’s illegal. But also I deserve to not be in misery."
BipolarReddit,ffmqu87,t1_ffmecsq,1580057957.0,The illness itself. My current depression is so much bleaker and harder to manage than it was initially. I also developed self harm tendencies at 28ish? My suicidal ideation is strong and thankfully I’m only passive. It’s also harder to manage with meds? I medicated from 2018-2019 then my meds stopped working. This time I made it 3 weeks before my meds stopped working. Im exhausted.

I didn’t say that I’m better than other girls or that I’m unique for my choices...I’m here because I also think the “I’m not like other girls I’m so qUiRkY and UnIqUe” thing is dumb, I was just sharing a story about how I appreciate both sides of this person’s argument: being able to wear makeup and being able to not wear makeup."
LifeProTips,fflradc,t3_eu54uz,1580043145.0,I use temporary tattoos and draw on myself :) but also :( since I haven’t totally kicked the impulse but we’re getting there!
