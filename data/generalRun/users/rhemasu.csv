wholesomememes,ffnfa54,t1_ffne6h4,1580065238.0,I do believe that. Your post really made me remember that it’s not worth dying for a few migraines (kind of an understatement). Have had a horrible migraine that won’t go away since Wednesday night and last night there was a fire in the building and we had to evacuate and then they had to literally get firefighters to help me back to my room and I’m just feeling generally like a burden to the people who have been helping me since then and also feeling like shit for making my fiancé feel that helpless because he can’t do much from a whole another country. So idk everything sucks but I’ll live through another day

LGBTeens,ff5vgdf,t1_ff5qn2m,1579611624.0,"Good question. This isn’t something you learn overnight, it took me a few years of therapy to get where I am. And the process is different for everyone so I can’t really speak for anyone but myself. For me: it started out by asking myself every morning “why are you worthy to be loved?” I’d come up with at least 3 things at the start. It was the same 3 things at first. I thought my 3 reasons of being love worthy were pathetic. But after two weeks of that, therapist said try to come up with one new thing every other day. Why would someone love you? Why should you love yourself? What are the best things about you? 

This may or may not work for you. I know I felt silly doing this each morning. But when you give yourself reasons to love yourself, you slowly start actually loving yourself. I still sometimes find myself thinking that I don’t deserve to be loved as much as my SO loves me but now if I catch myself thinking that, I’ll quickly list 5 things I did in the past month that I think make me worthy to be loved. 

Of course, it doesn’t always work and sometimes I’ll go to my SO and tell him I feel unlovable. He tells me why he loves me and why I should love myself. At the beginning it took me a full 1 hour therapy session to come up with 3 things. Now it usually takes me approximately five minutes to come up with 5 things. If I can’t do that, now I also have a partner who’ll help me out. First time doing this is always the hardest. It got easier over time for me. 


Actually, let’s do this exercise right now. Everyone here who feels like they’re unlovable, please respond to this comment or pm me with three things about you that make you deserving of love. Or even just one. (One of the first three things I said was “I have pretty eyes” so anything works). I love each one of you. Because you deserve it"

LGBTeens,ff5754m,t3_erp9vr,1579582168.0,"You are NOT an unlovable failure. My therapist always says, “you can’t love another person adequately unless you love yourself completely”. After years working on learning to love myself, I have come to realize that this is valid. I’m now in a stable relationship with a loving, caring person I never thought could be real. Remember: you are an amazing lovable person, and you deserve to be loved and happy. You deserve hugs and cuddles and kisses, you deserve to be spoiled with love. Love yourself harder than you’ve loved anyone, and you will find someone who loves you the same way. 

And since you’ve given me no reason not to: I love you, OP. You got this, you’ll be happy"

I have done it several times that I call one  of them over to my room and hug them and cuddle with them until they get tired. Then a few hours later, I’ll have a panic attack and find out that that’s when it started. Sometimes the doomsday feeling comes and goes without panic being involved at all."

wholesomememes,feryykp,t1_ferwpr5,1579359800.0,"You might not be able to do this in a big class, but getting the students to sit in a circle and looking at everyone in turn while explaining the material and also throwing in a few funny stories helps get the points across. Use analogies, hell, my favorite teacher would sometimes dance in class to make a point. 

At the end ask if they get it. But don’t say “any questions?” Students blank out on that. Look at a small group and say “did you understand?” Then turn to another small group “what about you?” Turn to next, “You?” This makes them feel like the teacher sees them and cares about them. That makes them more interested. 

I’ve taken a few childcare trainings, done a lot of reading on child psychology and taught in a class of 10-13 year olds and these things work.

Edit: also ran a sunday school class of 3-13 year olds and making the kids feel seen and known really helps them learn better"
