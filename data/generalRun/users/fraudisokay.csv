politics,feetont,t1_feesqqq,1579040985.0,Because a certain amount of Trump's base are white nationalists or sympathize with white nationalists.  Trump controls Miller's appointment.  Miller is Trump's dog whistle to that segment of the electorate.
LawSchool,feei621,t1_feeg1nl,1579034240.0,Yeah I wouldn't be defeated by this.  I think the odds are in your favor - especially if the administrative staff at your school are reasonable.  Definitely make an appeal.  This is an irrational punishment.  There are plenty of other law schools out there that grade up to the word limit.  This doesn't constitute a failing grade if that's their sole reasoning.
subaru,fedu1fb,t3_eomif6,1579019884.0,You should leave it on there as a sign of dominance.
mealtimevideos,fea5wbb,t3_eo673w,1578944722.0,That bone drill that automatically stops when the pressure changes is a pretty remarkable piece of technology.  I've only seen grinders used to take off pieces of the skull which freaks me out.  The drill seems much safer.

moderatepolitics,fdhmgec,t1_fdhln3y,1578425760.0,"Again, if this is your position, I suggest removing rule-breaking comments instead of leaving them available for others to comment on.  The entire ""content"" of the poster's comment was a giant generalization and smear against Trump's dissenters.  His claims warranted a defense, but it wouldn't need that defense if the moderation team did a better job removing rule-breaking comments before they gain traction.

Have a nice day."
moderatepolitics,fdhkue8,t1_fdhjotr,1578424782.0,"Did you even read the ""content"" of the comment I was replying to?  I was responding with a little advice since the poster seemed flustered by criticism of Trump.  If you care to moderate this heavily, I suggest removing rule breaking comments instead of leaving them up for people to reply to.  My response was warranted.  

(1) I never implied that this subreddit is somehow ""better"" - that's you putting words in my mouth.  I simply implied this subreddit is not an echo chamber.  ""Better"" is entirely subjective and I am not making an ethical judgment either way.

(2) I phrase my comment in an ""If..then.."" manner.  You are supplying the variable to the ""if"" and insinuating an attack when there is no attack present.

(3) If someone attacks the act of criticizing the president, or any public official for that matter, I will continue to question their loyalty to the constitution.  That isn't a personal attack or an opinion - it's an objective observation based on attitude and behavior."

todayilearned,fdgxi3k,t1_fdgxa6x,1578410751.0,The exhibit is only at the museum until the 14th.  It was only $20 for the wife and I.  Highly recommended!
todayilearned,fdgv2mm,t1_fdgugwm,1578409050.0,"[Yes.  It's Norman Rockwell's America.](https://www.northwestmuseum.org/exhibits/current-exhibits/norman-rockwells-america)  It's at the Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture in Spokane, WA.  I know it is a traveling exhibit, so check their dates."
moderatepolitics,fdgup7p,t1_fdggzm2,1578408787.0,"You're putting a lot of words in my mouth with this comment.  

(1) I didn't posit that anyone ""needs"" an echo-chamber, I said that perhaps it'd be more suiting to the poster's needs since he or she is obviously upset by seeing criticism of the president.  

(2) Trump is destroying the fabric of the U.S. - it is vehemently anti-American to assert the president is immune from scrutiny.  By saying we shouldn't be allowed to criticize the president, I would question their loyalty to our constitution and the first amendment.  This isn't about a difference of opinion, this is about constitutional principles being swept under the rug.

I broke no rules with my comment - you are attempting to read into it in order to justify your warning."
todayilearned,fdgu1qc,t1_fdgopxz,1578408318.0,We have a temporary exhibit in town that includes 22 original Rockwell paintings in addition to all 323 covers of the Saturday Evening Post.  He was an extremely talented artist that really did a wonderful job of capturing the American spirit.
mealtimevideos,fde3l2w,t1_fde3j2i,1578330415.0,Or just assume that you don't know what his genuine feelings are.  Because you don't.  Any assumption otherwise is unfounded idiocy.
mealtimevideos,fde3h79,t1_fde3f7k,1578330346.0,Such naive confidence.  You shouldn't speculate so freely.
mealtimevideos,fde38zi,t1_fde33zj,1578330196.0,He knows he's on camera.  He could be playing along.  I like how you think you know what Tom Hanks is thinking.  Can you tell me more about what he's thinking since you know so much about Tom Hanks?  So glad you could enlighten me with your celebrity ESP.
mealtimevideos,fde2quu,t1_fde2cpe,1578329869.0,That isn't my point.  My point is an actor's face is hard to read and isn't a good indicator of how they're actually feeling.  I don't care to speculate why Mr. Hanks would be acting offended.
mealtimevideos,fddz66e,t1_fddxjri,1578327507.0,He's an actor.
moderatepolitics,fddsx0v,t1_fdcy5fc,1578323152.0,"As a conservative never-Trumper, your assertion that being critical of this president makes you a ""snowflake"" or a ""liberal"" is a fallacious false dichotomy.  Trump is objectively the most damaging to our country of any modern president.  If you aren't critical of this president, I would question your loyalty to the American way.  If you can't handle warranted criticism, perhaps an echo-chamber like /r/conservative or /r/the_donald would more suit your interests."

interestingasfuck,fc66f32,t3_egcejs,1577473331.0,"I just saw one of these on Antiques Roadshow a few weeks ago.  It was the [1941 Willie Sutton prison escape head and hand](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/season/22/harrisburg-pa/appraisals/1941-willie-sutton-prison-escape-head-hand--201701A45/).  Sutton's looks a little more well crafted than these, though."
law,fc0k1ms,t3_eff5kg,1577292598.0,"Let's delve into the [definition](https://www.constitution.org/cmt/high_crimes.htm) of ""high crimes and misdemeanors"".  I think to appropriately understand this verbiage, we must take a step back in time and examine popular nomenclature from the 1760s.  If we take this time frame and combine it with the contemporary definition of ""high crime and misdemeanor"" we can clearly see that the framers most likely intended the phrase to include any kind of abuse of office.

(1) ""High"" crimes simply means those crimes committed by those in ""high"" places, such as those positions of public trust and confidence.

(2) These offenses do not require prohibition by statute, but only need offend the sense of prevailing justice of the people and the court.

(3) Offering tax-payer funded foreign aid on condition of a smear campaign against a domestic  political opponent clearly falls into the realm of abuse of power, and would therefore be constituted as a ""high crime and misdemeanor"".  

These actions grotesquely contort our political system into one that offends the sense of prevailing justice of the people and is plainly within grounds of impeachment."
