First you have one guy hold on to the cardboard portion. Have him stand in the middle. 

Have the second and third guy each hold on to each ziptie and call upon the Gods and summon an old ancient gripping technique called Eagle Claw. 

Once summoned, have them pull. The first guy should focus and, with a straight face, laugh as loud as he can.
