You can only push as hard as you can before your feet slip, extra strength doesn't help after that. But if you weigh more, you have more friction and that means you can push harder before slipping occurs.

Of course, some shoes/paws grip better, and lower center of gravity is an advantage for the same weight. But if those are kept equal, the heavy side usually wins."

news,ffjseu0,t1_ffjfj1u,1580005680.0,"I feel like is an absurd exaggeration to call all cops ""traitors to their class""

The majority of cops I've had any level of personal relationship with have all really done their best to serve their community, when it's possible. The rest (excluding one real horrible twat) just do their job as expected.

But ""cop gives warning, spoke to delusional homeless man as a fellow human, de-escalated the situation, and everything turned out okay"" just doesn't make the news. Instead it's horrible events like in this post and those pandering ""cop buys black child a Christmas gift"" stories. But 99% of events involving police fall in the boring middle. And 99% of cops are out there doing normal human things, not psychopathic ones. And the vast majority never fire their weapon on the job their entire career. Most are fulfilling a roll that is necessary in our society.

Almost every ""business"" interaction I've had with police was either safety related or reporting. Someone hit my car and they file a police report. I was speeding and they tell me to slow down. Most just fill this roll every day for their whole career. There is not a thing traitorous about that.

I kind of agree on disarming the police, but I think we would need alter our gun laws first. We have way too much gun crime for unarmed police force. There are monthly civilian shootings in my neighborhood, none by the police. We aren't really comparable to countries with unarmed police. But an officer having a gun really is a liability. The bigger liability is the lack of repercussions after a cop is involved in a shooting though."

Colloquially, it implies aerodynamic flight, which basically means generating lift. This is broken down into two categories

If you don't create thrust, you're gliding. This is unpowered flight. Soaring from birds you use warm air updrafts for lift and glide the rest of the time is included in gliding 

Using a propeller, rocket, turbine, or beating wing to provide thrust is powered flight. 

There's also ballistic flight, using momentum. And buoyant flight, like balloons. And every category has several other subcategory

Point is, if you're moving through the atmosphere, scientifically you're flying. Even if you're moving straight towards the ground."

It's obviously at least partially based on attraction. Maybe he's attracted to younger women and she's attracted to men of high status. Maybe it's some other facet that attracts them, That's the only part that's obvious.

The rest is situational. I've dated someone much older than me, and I've dated much younger than me. (+/- 10 years at 28)

It's only about enjoying each other's company and comparability. But it could be about abuse if one of us were abusive. It requires that signifier of abusiveness though.

nottheonion,ffbuiks,t1_ffa7cvg,1579783203.0,"It's relative to the US. 23 cases of rabies per year is not a full statistic. It's absolutely not an absolute number.

Here, let's learn something about relative and absolute numbers.

Relative numbers require a reference. A good example is air pressure. If you have air at pressure in a tire, it's relative pressure might be found by comparing it to the air immediately outside the tire. This is useful for knowing when the tire might be damaged. But if you want to know if the water vapor inside the air in the tire is about to condense, you'd need to compare the pressure to an absolute vacuum.

So here, we have the effects on American knowledge by rabies, so it's important to list the US along side the number of cases in the US to relate the number to the effects.

If you just say 23, it can be misconstrued as all cases everywhere  which would be false. 

Look, even the guy I replied to gets it. You're the only dumbfuck here who thinks the word ""Americans"" ~six comments above means it definitely applies to every comment after. As if conversations have never derailed and as if that person wasn't comparing Americans to other countries when they brought America up.

There. Hope that helps and you're smarter now, but my expectations are low, because idiots who like to try and put people down on the internet for absolutely no reason other than to try and feel smarter while offering absolutely nothing to the conversation themselves tend to remain idiots.
