In a 5-gallon batch, I used a 5 oz ""whirlpool"" addition and 6 oz dry hop Citra/Simcoe. The beer was good but it didn't taste like it was enough to me. Admittedly, this was a ""New England Imperial Black Ale"" but I have made it before with good results.

todayilearned,fcnee66,t1_fcldrvm,1577809983.0,"Yes, that one makes me sad, and especially so now that it's documented in at least one dictionary."
Homebrewing,fcndt76,t1_fclyy3i,1577809605.0,Niceâ€”it looks like there are several guides. Thanks for the tip! This one seems good: https://anovaculinary.com/anovafoodnerd-sous-vide-home-brewing/
todayilearned,fcndjxt,t1_fclkkzh,1577809438.0,"Good point. I was being too pedantic for common speech. ""Wow, what an accurate AND precise shot"" seems silly for casual conversation."
Homebrewing,fcncif2,t1_fcn8keb,1577808752.0,Are you planning to add more faucets to your kegerator? It seems like everything else in your setup is very nice and would allow multiple kegs. Awesome score on the sink! I'm in the market for one and will definitely check Craigslist now.
Homebrewing,fclbkva,t1_fcl96f5,1577744046.0,I'm curious how you're planning to do this since I would be very reluctant to put my sous vide in anything but water. Perhaps that is part of your plan though!
Homebrewing,fclb5xv,t1_fcl4jm1,1577743782.0,"Similarly: brew more, buy less. I've been buying a lot of NEIPA and it is fairly expensive. With some more practice I could likely nail the style but haven't gotten there yet. Or maybe I'll just start going west-ish coast and enjoy beer with lower calories."
smoking,fcl51rs,t1_fckx22b,1577739966.0,Can you elaborate please? I've used my smoker about 4 times and am very eager to smoke a brisket. My current backup plan is to use a pressure cooker if the brisket is too tough.
todayilearned,fcl2aes,t1_fckz3cq,1577738254.0,"Many native English speakers use the words interchangeably as well, unfortunately. Similar to ""anxious"" meaning ""eager"" instead of ""full of anxiety."""
CraftBeer,fcl1zey,t1_fck79b1,1577738064.0,For sure--I've broken a couple in my days as well but it is such a nice glass otherwise.
cider,fc99yaq,t1_fc8tlos,1577549430.0,"I wonder if there was a design change because I have a few 6.5 gallon big mouth bubblers that are a few years old and they DO have screw tops. The lids are so secure that you can use them to lift the full carboy.

edit: lids, not kids"
beergeek,fbqej3g,t3_edxxqm,1577030894.0,"I looked up the TGBeers web site on [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/) and can confirm you're right about the ABV change. 

**Pseudo Sue:**

[February 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180212011554/https://www.tgbrews.com/beers/#tg-details-576) - **6.2% ABV**. 

[August 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180827131127/https://www.tgbrews.com/beers/#tg-details-576) - **6.8% ABV**. 

[November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191122173956/https://www.tgbrews.com/beers/) - **5.8% ABV**. 

Another interesting change on that list is that King Sue moved from Rotating to Flagship!"
