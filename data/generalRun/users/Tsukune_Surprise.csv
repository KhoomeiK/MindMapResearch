todayilearned,fgeyuft,t1_fgexwi6,1580715673.0,"It's a little different.  

A Secret clearance can be done in a few months and requires some background check.

If you want to see a person with clearances twitch- ask them to fill out a new SF-86.  The SF-86 is the document used in full background checks where you have to put your entire life story - where you've lived, every international trip you've ever taken, financial info, friends, family names, etc.  It can take days to fill out this form.

Then you'll have additional screening for Top Secret.  Secret and Top Secret are known as collateral clearances.

Then you have SCI clearances- special compartmented information.  Different SCI clearances require different checks - some require a counterintelligence polygraph, some require both a counterintel poly and a lifestyle poly.

The SCI clearances are the clearances for sensitive information held by different organizations - like a Q clearance, etc.  

Then there are the holy of holies - Special Access Programs.  SAPs require SCI background investigations and are the ""need to know"" type of things of Hollywood lore.  SAPs cover sensitive and fragile technologies or operations.  The difference between SAPs and SCIs is that with an SCI clearance I can see anything that is classified within that compartment.  So, for example, if I have a Q clearance then I can read any document marked Q.  With a SAP, you are only allowed to access to that specific SAP.  If I'm cleared to DANK ALBATROSS all I can see is DANK ALBATROSS material- I can't see anything related to DANK SPARROW.

There are two flavors of SAPs- acknowledged and unacknowledged.  An example of an acknowledged SAP is the stealth bomber.  The U.S. admits it exists but the technologies behind it are closely guarded SAP information.  The unacknowledged SAPs you never hear about because the very existence of the activity/technology is classified.

There's a lot more detail and nuance to this (somewhere a DoD security officer is saying, ""but what about..."") but this is just a top level description of the security classification apparatus."

In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies.

So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts.
