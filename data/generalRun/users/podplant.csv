asexuality,ffa7718,t1_ff9o816,1579729216.0,That’s adorable. I’m adding it to the “pros” column on my list of pros and cons for getting a cat.

AnxietyDepression,ffa6rbc,t1_ff8pt71,1579728972.0,"I agree, posting here isn’t a solution. It was more of a frustration/venting thing because I felt like I was running out of options. But the people who have replied had lots of good suggestions, and I’m continuing to explore all my options. I didn’t know that about the churches, I’ll add that to my list of things to check out. Thank you so much for the advice!"

AnxietyDepression,ffa6b4r,t1_ff8v2pc,1579728724.0,"From the US. I just need to educate myself about the systems that are in place where I live. It’s just difficult when I’m already in the midst of issues to be the one who has to go out and figure out how to get the help I need. But I just gotta not give or get frustrated and vent to reddit lol. I appreciate your reply. Good luck with your situation as well, that sounds tough."
AnxietyDepression,ffa5whj,t1_ff8yvfc,1579728502.0,"I don’t know the first thing about finding a good affordable doctor. My family never had one growing up, and I’m on my own now. I’ll check out that book, though. Thanks for the empathy and suggestions!"
AnxietyDepression,ffa5pbe,t1_ff95043,1579728392.0,"My job does have health insurance, but I’ll have to check and see what it covers in terms of mental health"
AnxietyDepression,ffa5kzj,t1_ff9mgf1,1579728324.0,"Yeah, the US isn’t the greatest on healthcare, but thanks for the well wishes! I plan on doing some more digging to see if I can find any affordable options"

Empaths,ffa5aom,t1_ff9r8ql,1579728165.0,"Fair enough, I guess I’ll do some digging then!"
