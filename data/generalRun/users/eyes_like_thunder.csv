AmItheAsshole,feepxvn,t1_fee3p45,1579038743.0,"Dude, I wish. Here they have non police private escort cars with flashing lights. If you don't pull over and let the entire procession pass you can actually get a ticket. And yes, the forward escort cars will absolutely fart forward and take over an intersection"

MealPrepSunday,fdguh1q,t1_fdgg0s7,1578408624.0,"Know it sounds weird, but hear me out.. Tackle box. Like the single layer little trays. Find the right shape/size you want and it's already got moisture proof dividers.."

fountainpens,fdfe6zl,t1_fdfcqwu,1578359606.0,"This one is one Amazon, but it legit ships from Japan (where pilot is) so it takes a hot minute to actually arrive. The only other big jugs I know of are the 1L from pelikan and 1Ls from Blackstone (Australian)"
fountainpens,fdemnom,t1_fdemcsm,1578342243.0,Perfect! Last thing I need is all my school notes doing down the drain!
fountainpens,fdegxij,t1_fde8pl7,1578338783.0,"I've used it previously. Nothing fancy, but it's dependable, which is why I chose it. Its got a reputation for being very tolerant on different papers (does feather/bleed as bad on cheap stuff), dries quick, and is semi water resistant (will still smudge/smear, but still readable-some inks will 100% wash off..)"
fountainpens,fdegnkw,t1_fdebyxj,1578338612.0,No prob!

fountainpens,fde6me4,t1_fde0boq,1578332325.0,"I fill a sample vial and stick the pen in that. I have a separate vial for each ink bottle, so don't even have to clean it out in between and just keep the vial stocked. This pen (twsbi go) is super easy, even for a piston because it's spring activated, as opposed to a knob or anything. Easy to do one handed even!"
fountainpens,fddtm34,t1_fddt8sn,1578323658.0,So does Blackstone! That's crazy.. Picked this guy for its supposed water resistance

askwomenadvice,fcx5pdz,t1_fcwymky,1578052317.0,"Same. This conversation is important to be had.

Dude decided to hang out the window as they were going (no idea why), but was hanging out so far his head got hit by traffic. Broke literally every bone in his face.
