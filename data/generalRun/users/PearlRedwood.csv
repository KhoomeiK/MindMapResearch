Blackish,ffn39vh,t3_eu52u1,1580061579.0,The only thing I kinda didn't like is the new kitchen. I liked the old one better. The house itself is lovely.
IKEA,ffkw0uq,t3_eu392p,1580030024.0,"The sound is great, I'm not a pro but I loved it. Considering we already have a decent sound system, we're not planning on buying it but I really liked it, especially the way it fits into a kallax shelf."
OldSchoolCool,ffj3cgn,t1_ffibzf5,1579989341.0,I loved Super Gran when I was little. And now I miss my gran too.

HomeImprovement,feyyqat,t3_eqrkpl,1579452130.0,"I always liked DIY and I like to think I'm god at it. My SO is visually impaired so now I kinda have to be the primary DIYer anyway.
He inherited an apartment in a building from 1920s and we're trying to make it more liveable as it is in a pretty bad shape but has really good bones. Unfortunately, the money is tight and I'm working 40 hours a week so I don't have the time to work on stuff as much as I want to so it's taking me years. I'm hoping to find another part time job to hopefully speed things up..."

MovieSuggestions,fexme9k,t1_fexd52u,1579433258.0,"Yeah, it had such an impact on us when we were kids that we still reference it. I have no idea why mom let us watch it with her. I had no idea that this movie was not hugely popular in the US."

AskBalkans,fen0qt8,t3_eq14zw,1579274383.0,"My mom is Catholic but it was never a big deal. I grew up celebrating two Christmases and two Easters which was extremely cool.  There's this lovely event in a small town in Vojvodina, where there's a lot of nationalities in one place and they have a Christmas concert in a Catholic church. Both Orthodox and Catholic people gather and the program is just lovely. It's the best thing."

assholedesign,fe80yg1,t1_fe6z5i0,1578921146.0,I saw the same thing on Aliexpress but in the description it said it was just the rope. I remember because it sounded too good to be true - and of course it was.
daschund,fe74nbv,t3_eo0ywr,1578909940.0,"What a lovely long snoot! Please kiss it from me, you have a beautiful dog."
aspergers,fe6z2ds,t1_fe6nzcv,1578907921.0,"Yeah, it's like, *I know* there's something so different about me in comparison to other people, I sometimes feel like an alien.

In my case, no one ever talked to me about the possibility, I don't even think it existed because I live in a small country and autism is still used to describe only severe cases in children. I tried searching someone who deals with adults, reached out but never received a response. The results of online tests are off the charts basically, and I see my shortcomings in daily communication, especially with my SO.  He knows I suspect I have it, but thinks that it's just a coincidence and that I haven't developed my social/communication skills.

The reality is that I probably won't be able to get the diagnosis but finding this subreddit and all the source materials here really helped a lot to realise some things and find people with similar issues. It feels good knowing you're not the only one."
