Fighters,ff9vjsz,t1_ff9s2ed,1579722432.0,The difference is really utility. You should never throw out a raw Ken Tatsu because it is bad damage and isn't worth the risk. Akuma tatsu is best used in combo extension and Ryu's Tatsu can be used raw or as a combo ender to surprise the opponent or place the opponent and take a bit of health off.
Games,ff9uj88,t1_ff9t9nf,1579721674.0,Yeah people are stupid asking for Sora in smash. That would be like having Banjo in Smash when there is no way to play Banjo Kazooie on the Switch or Joker from Persona 5 in Smash when that game isn't on any Nintendo platform.

Having to beat the level with no bees took him as long as the rest of the game to beat and he disliked the game more because of it.

aww,ff7mkta,t3_es1k17,1579653145.0,When the game was at it's most popular a couple of friends of mine gave their phones to a kid that belonged to two other friends of ours. He wasted all the Pokeballs catching a bunch of Pidgey. Well later that year the kid was diagnosed with cancer and a couple years later passed away. One of my friends took one of the pokemon he caught and leveled him up in order to claim a gym in their town. Idk if that gym is still owned by that pokemon but it makes me happy knowing someone did that on his behalf. A lot of people are still really affected by his passing as he made a lot of friends in his last couple of years and even had a song dedicated for him by a local band.

It might be worth having but idk exactly what they could show off of that game that would be an appealing demo. I am almost done with the game, just have the impossible lair left, but my favorite thing in that game was the secrets in the overworld and getting the second version of stages. The impossible lair is way too tough to make a good demo but it is how the game starts and no other level is nearly as hard. Maybe showing of level 3 and the b side of 3 may be the best demo but then you don't experience the overworld at all."

Games,ff3zp7o,t1_ff30c6h,1579552379.0,I played Sonic Mania last year. Considered one of the best Sonic games ever. I didn't like it very much. Too many blind jumps and stiffness for a character I thought was supposed to represent speed. Sonic really needs a dynamic camera to zoom out and rezone the character because without memorizing a level there is no way to know when to act.
Games,ff3yj9v,t3_erf2lh,1579551646.0,I have nothing against the game or the company but I got to say I am not the most excited about what I have seen of the game so far. I really don't care if they delay this game to make it better because what I have seen so far hasn't sold me on the game and if they can add something to make it more of an interesting game I am all for that.

SamuraiShodown,feshpod,t1_fes2x4u,1579365267.0,I agree. If I buy it again though I still want this new version to be better in some way. Not sure what they could add but something to make it the definitive edition.

Games,fekta8a,t1_fekafo6,1579207147.0,All in this week. It makes sense because it is the end of fiscal 3rd Quarter 2019 on the 15th and will allow them to not have reported profits. What sucks is that at E3 2019 the devs said the game had already gone gold meaning a fully payable complete game was made and then they are using 1.5 years to polish and maybe add more cool shit to it.
TwoBestFriendsPlay,fekpvvv,t1_feknbfc,1579205146.0,True but that isn't a confirmation that we will see a Joaquin Phoenix Joker fight a Jack Nicholson Joker. It could just be the young an old face at least until more microtransactions arrive.

Sekiro,fehhzv9,t1_fehh1s0,1579116930.0,And that is great to think that I believe. I just don't know what happened from when the game came out to it winning best game of the year at a lot of award shows.

StarWars,fehh5cc,t1_fegq256,1579116432.0,Okay so the last Jedi was pretty short on new cool locations but this isn't a great pic to use. Why not use Luke's hideaway planet or the Casino planet? Sure nothing of value happened on the casino planet but it still looked good.
Sekiro,fehbmgc,t1_feha13k,1579113216.0,That could be the truth too. It could be that as people got over the difficulty they learned to love the game. Or game critics were too ashamed to say they hadn't beat a significant portion of it so they voted it to win based on that. Committee voting does have its flaws.
Sekiro,feh82uj,t1_feg7acp,1579111090.0,This is a bit of a side note but what was it that turned people around on loving this game. The reviews when it came out made it pretty clear that the game wasn't living up to most critics expectations of fromsoft but then it goes on to win a bunch of awards more than even Bloodborne from my limited research. What part of this game changed most people's opinion from it being just another Souls like game and into a masterpiece? I am still in the beginning of the game so I may not have hit that part yet but I need a little motivation to keep trying so I don't mind spoilers.

I understand being upset that the new hardware won't have an immediate reason to buy in but this is overall pro consumer. If you don't mind playing gears 6 at 30fps 1080p then you are good but if you upgrade you can play at 60fps at 1080 or 4k at 30+(but hopefully locked).
