saltierthancrait,ffsx9y1,t1_ffsnjzy,1580196276.0,"Well, i cant really give my input here because the only EU story i knew about that other friends knew about was Dark Empire and not even by name until i learned it myself like a decade later - we just knew about the emperor coming back and we called it stupid- cool but stupid. As in, it's a cool concept and story that he hops into clone bodies, but at the same time it cheapens the importance of the OT.

I think that was the biggest reason i was able to disassociate the EU with the movies and treat it as its own 'twilight zone'/'what if' story/alternate take: i didnt want the emperor coming back but i also wanted to read about him coming back through clone hoping lol. get what i mean?

but yea, i was too young to get deep into the EU so only knew the surface level and the clone premises of Dark Empire. I had internet sometimes though and my myspace before myspace was a star wars messaging forum. Id read a few novels too but i just checked and none of the books you listed. Unfortunately for me my only SW book access was the local library and walmart - which had the Yuuzhan Vong books 1 and 2..... 2 where (major character spoiler!) >!Chewie!< dies, so that kinda broke my soul and i never read an EU novel again because i felt still in mourning lol full 5 stages of grief lol

Thats why it seemed disliked as canon but tolerated as non-canon: Its still cool to see Luke defeat the emperor himself, but not cool when it diminishes the closing movie to a trilogy - kinda cheapens the whole trilogy when the 3rd movies final boss just comes back again and says he never died."

I love Jango and Boba for more than being just bounty hunters...

but im baffled that with these thousands of games with endless lame ass fetch quests, but theres yet to be a game where you go collect your enemies rather than stupid trinkets or shit. SW:Bounty Hunter is the closest thing i can think of and its still pretty fun to scan your enemies to see which of them are worth your time, and if you should capture them dead or alive.

I think the Mandalorian show exemplified perfectly that Bounty Hunting is fucking perfect for video games and their quest formats. 

You probably already know, but its on PS4 store or you can download it for Dolphin emulator. Ive been using it for PC AND HOLY SHIT! Just remembered i found my gamecube controller, from when i was a kid, a few weeks ago- i still have the bounty hunter gc disk so i think im gonna have to get back into it soon :D  I was using the Steam Controller but never configured it properly so the camera settings sucked... 

ok i know im ranting, got off topic, but glad you made me think about it!"
StarWarsBattlefront,ffpd1vb,t1_ffp9mgd,1580092008.0,"yea, but to be completely honest i dont think id enjoy it as much if it were an ability with a cooldown.

I think it'd be awesome though if it was a toggle ability without cooldown. Th cooldown should be for every time you shoot so people cant shoot fast as fucking lightning like you can with the Arc troopers. So a slower fire rate rather than ability cooldown.

My ideal gameplay would be hold L2(aim) to toggle dual targeting mode which slows your firing rate but locks on to anyone within close range (like force pull range) and as long as youre holding L2 you can keep it active. Jetpack would be more like the Jet Troopers than Bobas infinite fly time - Jango is in canon much more of a 'dirty' aggressive fighter where boba is more smarts - i think jango being on the ground but with a jetpack that launches you in short bursts would be better and unique. Still more fuel so you dont die to lightsabers all the time though (**shivers at the thought of Mace Windu*)

So L2 for toggle auto aim, L1 for jetpack burst, and then R1 and R1+L1 abilities as well. 

I think R1 as his grappling hook would be sick; they already have the code to draw wire to target (the Hoth speeders can shoot tow lines on the AT-ATs) so you shoot your 'line' at enemy player, and if you use jetpack burst it then rips them from the ground the same way force pull does.

L1+R1 idk, not too picky (big flamethrower ability!?), but i really would just love a toggle auto aim with appropriate balance. I think he'd be pretty unique, most of the code for my suggested abilities is already implemented in the game."

Playing the Bounty Hunter game from Legends it was disclosed that Dooku intended to select whoever could kill his rogue sith apprentice.

According to [some list though](http://starwarsuniverse2.tripod.com/id9.html), Jango is tied with lowest midi count in the series.

All have 1500: Jango, Boba, Han Solo, Owen Lars.

I kinda figured with the Fetts luck in all their battles and Hans extreme luck, that they'd at least be more force sensitive than most. Not a level to say they can use the force, but to explain how they theyve been so lucky considering all 3 should be dead given the odds they have been up against, regardless of skill level. I mean the force is kinda like plot armor which those 3 have, i understand it was the official take but it doesnt make sense to me.

Easier to ignore if you didnt like it.

They really havent tried a single original idea with Star Wars since. Everything Disney has made relies heavily on connecting to the OT and their characters or plots. 

Theyve owned the franchise for over half a decade and they havent tried anything outside of the 'safe zone'."

He'd already done some VO prior to working on Star Wars but it kinda became his career after Star Wars was done.

wow. damn, that video you sent me i watched years ago. I only remember because the youtubers voice is familiar and as theyre talking its refreshing my memory of what he said. He wasn't able to convince me because his argument was trying more to convince people that disliked the movies that the show is better. I liked the movies though lol. I know they could've been better but i cant say i dislike them. 
 
I also, years ago, watched his video [Star Wars: Rebels - Why it Sucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvwNgtAR8cE) (26 mins? jesus i cant believe i watched a 26 min review) and it was pretty funny.

I think this is what i needed to hear to convince me. I mean, the whole conversation has helped and this is kinda the summarization of it, but to hear that it gets better in this regard is enough to consider giving more episodes a try.

So thanks a ton for hearing me out! Your willingness to understand my viewpoint and perspective on the show in those regards has convinced me to pick it back up.

PrequelMemes,ffjhgj6,t1_ffjejjm,1579998316.0,"Ima break this into chunks

> You described one small continuity error in one part of one episode of a show that has 5 seasons. That’s not much to make a judgment off of.

Im just using the most recent episode i watched as an example. I was just giving one example of many how Grievous is treated like your typical saturday morning cartoon villain. I know this is even a common criticism for people who enjoy the show.

>Remember in Revenge of the Sith when Grievous ditches his cape and takes like 8 seconds to pull out his four lightsabers?

They were still initiating the fight. If Obiwan would have leapt straight towards GG who was like 6 ft in front of him, GG would have enough space to be able to react quickly and im sure the battle droids that surrounded them start attacking as well. Easier to take out GG then the droids than try all at once. I dont see that scene unrealistic at all. 

A more accurate comparison between TCW and that scene imo would be if the camera showed them about to fight, then cut to grievous walking around the hangar and obiwan pops up right behind him. 

I'm talking about scene continuity, not plot armor. Like how Finn traveled like a mile across Crait to crash his ship but was able to walk back safely, past Kylo and across a plain field where the enemy is already shooting at the main base with an armada. So i guess it does happen in the films, but not the OT or PT as i recall. 

>(paraphrasing, but you saying that Ahsoka shouldnt die just to be realistic)

I agree. I didn't have a problem with GG being capable of killing  Ahsoka and then not doing it. The problem I had was how he was just seen chasing her, and then openly reveals that her droid is actually his spy, in the same room. Its not plot armor, im not talking about characters being safe from harm. 

I mean convenient as fuck plot elements that seem out of character or extremely unlikely - like the general of the droid army conspiring with his spy in the same room he knows the jedi he wants spied on is in. Tropes of the bad guys fucking up royaly from doing something so stupid even for them that it takes me out of it.

So i guess to rephrase my question:

Do the villains become more competent later on? 

Anyways, thanks for the respectful discussion!"
PrequelMemes,ffjbbgo,t1_ffjan1b,1579994709.0,"it..wasnt an argument.

PrequelMemes,ffj9uo4,t1_ffj9aqu,1579993817.0,not really. he takes out a shit ton of droids and takes like 8 blaster hits to the back before he gets off his one-liner and destroys the droids in self sacrificing explosion. Kinda unrealistic in the SW universe but its a heroic sacrifice sequence so the hero has to kill a bunch of baddies before he goes out. Standard heroic sacrifice.
PrequelMemes,ffj8gyg,t3_ets7nb,1579992951.0,"EDIT: thanks guys youve convinced me! I really appreciate it!

Can anyone here at least just acknowledge that this show is a kids show? People say 'oh if you dont like S1 then it gets better' but its hard to trust TCW fans when you guys downvote every single comment that says they tried but couldnt get into it.

I've posted this before and only gotten shit talkers but:

I tried giving TCW a chance and got to episode 8 of S1 but really having a hard time. Theres just moments of complete disbelieve that only a kid would miss*. 

And the inflection on lot of the lines are as if theyre talking in front of children - it sounds like a step above ""baby talk"". ""sky guy"" and other senseless nicknames are the stuff you only see in young childrens shows.

*[Like this scene:](https://youtu.be/2tddAJyQSqk?t=96) Ahsoka was in this room with GGrievous attacking her. GG finds her and stabs his lightsaber through the shelves to miss her, and as she drops her comlink, hes teleported down the aisle and in front of her to crush it with his foot. Yet when she runs away he just stands there, and then the worst part, the only part that actually bugged me - he stays in the room he knows shes still hiding in (he continues to look for her there)  and has a conversation with her droid which he reveals is his double agent spy.... right in front of her (shes on top of the shelf). Then it cuts to the clones and then back to Ahsoka - whos now on the ground with her lightsaber ignited, looking for a way out... and GG just grabs her as he was apparently hanging from the ceiling like a foot above her.

Like come on. That wouldnt fly in any of the movies. Its very forced for the plot.

I want to get into the show because I love the concept of a cartoon clone wars - allows for action that would be too expensive live action and not as entertaining if in a book or comic. Its just the show clearly caters to young kids. 

The 2003 Clone Wars wasn't. It was for all ages. Theres no ""baby talk"" in it, convoluted plot, or 'bad guy loses every time'.

**So can someone answer if TCW gets better in this regard?** I dont think i can enjoy any stuff like Mandalorians if the kids filter makes them talk about how they only fight to protect their friends or some shit."
