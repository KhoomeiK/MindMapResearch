rpg,ffbmubl,t1_ffbaejg,1579773240.0,"""Megagames"" is kinda that first one, they tend to lean towards a LARP focus (that is, a lot of it player driven) by necessity as you can only have so many Game Masters in a room with dozens of players, but I've seen *Look To The Skies* in action, and it seemed pretty dang entertaining. Heckloads of organization required, though."

I think it just needed to come in on a smaller scale story to kick things off. It was too ""big"" and uneven."

I'm not sold on Matt Ryan either, though I fucking *loved* his series and I'm glad they found a way to drag that out longer for him in lieu of a season 2. I think it's time for someone new. McAvoy isn't bad, but I'd like to be surprised by a fresh face."

Unsure if there's been a baby born to one of them, though, but in theory a ""test tube baby"" could be possible. It sort of depends on how strongly the ""traditional"" processes of conception and childbirth are important to you. But then, would you be as hesitant if science was necessary to ensure a cishet woman could conceive, if her natural processes were for whatever reason impaired? It can be a difficult discussion."
videos,fej52md,t1_fej3o87,1579157215.0,"Depends on who's definition you go by. The Almighty Acronym has largely expanded to LGBTQI+ so that it encompasses everything outside ""cishet"", but in doing so otherises intensely (both within and without the letters), which as far as I understand is the opposite of the point. Unfortunately, in order to make progress, this kind of has to be the case *for now*, but I believe the inevitable future (O, so far away it seems at the moment) is just to abolish gender entirely, and everyone is just people. Got a ways to go for that, though."
