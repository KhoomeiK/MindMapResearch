You didn't post baby bump pics on her posts about her miscarriage, right? So why is she posting those comments on your happiness posts?"

Then don't put her in your line. Send out a casting notice for the models that fit your idea of peacock perfection. I hope you have a great time with yourself because people that care about might stop doing so when you showcase how little you care about them. There's enough love for you from you they may feel unnecessary. Hopefully your fiance has photogenic hair, goddamn."

I don't know why anyone has to be an asshole here (except the fiancee). They're backing their family, you're backing yours. Depending how rude they are and lying, they'd be assholes. Sounds like they are since they're saying you could have done something. They probably had more of an opportunity to help her by raising her not be a shoplifter. If they knew they could have given you a heads up that she has sticky fingers.


There are a lot of people that would stand behind their fiancee in a legal situation, but in this case it'd be a conflict of interest anyway since you're tied to her and those she stole from. No two ways about it, she fucked up. Sounds like she went after your dad hoping for the leniency if she was caught. Sucks to be her."

NTA. Anyone participating in a potluck should be bringing *something*. Even ignoring all other factors, a person like this (unless there is a qualifying reason) is TA.


If forced to go forward, his behavior is *also* discriminatory, and he dismantled a premade dish (quite rude regardless of diet), and stole items from everyone else.

Maybe ask her the same. If she doesn't like people hearing about things she did intentionally, others probably don't like people talking about their natural appearance. If other customers were overhearing you discuss the surgeries, they surely heard her talk shit about the employee, which probably made them dislike her more than learning she got work done."

You are right, OP addressed the issue in the correct time and place and it still became an issue drawing focus from a benchmark moment in their lives. Mom made it the time and place to selfishly need to be addressed again. Very selfish move an forbidden. As you stated she decided to make it about her again in the room and afterward, so OP would be doing a disservice to her growth by catering again to that toxicity.

Too many times she engages in selfish, negative behavior means she has one shot or she's gone. She no longer gets the benefit of a second try. She fucked up, yet again, and earned a ban.

Literally never offered advice or guidance. Just leading questions, critiques, and *internal* ohs. No wonder you're so much better than her. You *feel* better, and never allow her to get better, just cut her down.


In an effort to not do the same to you (sorry I lashed out in my judgement. That was pretty goddamn rude of me), I'd suggest the following.


- She dumps the dry stuff into the wet. ""Is that how you were taught to do it?"" could be something else like ""Usually I dump wet into dry, like you would when baking. It help have fewer clumps. But I'll grab the whisk and that should help cut down on the clumps as well.""


- She let them get a little dark. ""Do you like them with a little crisp on them? These ones are a bit crispy. If you want, I can flip the next batch. I have this trick to watch for the bubbles that usually gets the the right brown for my tastes.""



- She says ""That one looks better."" You could respond without anger and instead say ""I actually added some flour for this batch. The batter looked a bit thin to me, which made our first one look a little lumpy/hard to cook/etc.""



I'd just remind you that, as you mentioned, she has less experience and for most folks, improving isn't much fun if we criticize. Also, she's 38 weeks pregnant so even some kind words can be frustrating. Also, you love her, right? So maybe don't default to dickhead when doing anything. We all have things we're more into or protective of, but that should be brought up PRIOR to the issue, not during or after. ""Hey, I'm a bit controlling when it comes to pancakes. Would you mind if I just made them this time and you can help with dinner?"" Get out in front of it."
