todayilearned,fflvtdl,t1_ffl9air,1580044793.0,"Nice.  I'd still probably watch this movie:

> Mercenaries devise a scheme to steal plans that need to be explained in layman terms for ransom under the watchful eye of corrupt US diplomats.  The plot twists when the Mercenaries hijack a shipment of life-saving drugs for ransom even after their original demands are met, unless a turncoat naval officer can gain the courage to do the right thing and stop the Mercenaries once and for all.  The movie ends with a mildly comical and/or ironic scene in which the Mercenaries blow up or go to prison.  Another satisfying tale of political intrigue and personal redemption closes, and we all walk away from this movie a little wiser."

You can add governments and political parties to that list too.  As someone who wouldn't fall into certain demographics, I only saw certain party political broadcasts after the UK election (I was shown these by my wife's family members).  Some of these adverts were bordering on fantasy fiction, but due to the rules (or lack thereof) the Conservative Party not only made what is starting to look like a whole bunch of empty promises but also falsely misrepresented opposition parties.  The result: people who would never have considered voting Tory did so in their millions.  Democracy is over, this is the age of Plutocracy."
