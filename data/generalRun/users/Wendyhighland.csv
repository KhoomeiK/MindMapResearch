First things first - if you can afford it go to a therapist. I am a firm believer everyone should have one (if you can afford it). If not them go buy a bunch of books about cognitive behavioural therapy, as well as some of the workbooks. 

It sounds like rumination bothers you, so have a strategy to deal with rumination will help. What I tell myself is that if I am ruminating, then I haven’t closed the incident. To close it I will journal about it or spend some time thinking about it, or applying the CBT methods against it. Rumination is hard to avoid, so when you do experience it you need to be able to catch it - and tel yourself that what you are thinking about cannot be changed nor is it helping you.

Then the remainder of my thoughts go towards 

1. Working on goals in my personal life and career 
2. Learning new things. By reading lots of books or informational YouTube channels, documentaries, skill share 
3. Making time for self care - time alone to think, meditating, exercise, etc
4. planning social time with friends and family 
5. Volunteering and helping others"

selfimprovement,fde3mdp,t1_fczkd5s,1578330438.0,"That’s a very good question. I’ve struggled with this because I have perfectionist tendencies. I don’t really make notes but not making them stresses me out. I’ve found that if I look at a book as a large brush stroke of information I’m ok with it - instead of trying to remember all the details. If a book Is full of actionable steps however I will either find a premade summary sheet online and store it in the cloud or I will use an app on my iPad to mindmap out all the actionable things. You will also find within this category of books there is always reputation among different habits and philosophies. By reading about them over and over from different authors it helps to solidify them in your brain.

A very relevant quote for me is knowledge without action is useless. So I’m trying to do a better job of actioning all the things I’m learning."

selfimprovement,fcxd5bt,t1_fcwrqsg,1578059715.0,A long time. I read about 20-25 books last year and it consumed a good chunk of time but I have no regrets about it I’ve learned so much. I find the time anywhere I can. Usually in the evenings before bed and in the morning on the weekends
