movies,ff43mf1,t1_ff3q8in,1579554809.0,"That scene is actually lifted directly from the novel and was based on an actual murder in Bangor, Maine.

It's not meant to be connected to the overall plot. It's meant to establish the character's return.

Also, in the book it's more clear but Pennywise does influence individuals by turning relatively small issues they have into huge problems. Beverly's dad, for instance, isn't just an unabashed child molester in the novel. He has sexual thoughts about her and hates himself for it and turns this hatred onto her in the form of hitting her. Pennywise all the while is poking and prodding him and making the problem worse and worse until finally it culminates in him chasing her around the house demanding to check her hymen and accusing her of sleeping with all the boys she hangs out with.

I live in rural Kentucky. I was driving home after work at about 1am and it's pitch black except for my headlights. Suddenly this big deer comes up in the lights standing in the middle of the road. So I slam on my brakes and swerve over into the other lane and I just barely miss this thing.

After I skidded to a stop I just sat there because I was in shock from almost totalling my car. I'm hitting my wheel and yelling at this deer like an asshole for a minute and then I calm down and turn to look back where it was and the deer is still standing there. I can just barely make it out in my rear lights, which is extra creepy because now its face is lit up red. But this deer just stares back at me and doesn't move. I've never seen a deer do that. I keep looking at it and it just looks right back and I start to get the feeling that it's thinking. Like if you've ever had a dog look at you and you get the creepy sensation that it's as intelligent as you and it's considering you. 

Finally, I turned around and hit the gas and went home. But a week or so later I had a nightmare that I woke up and opened my curtain and that fucking deer was staring at me through the window and in the dream I knew it was going to break into the house and kill me. I had the willies for weeks and when I'd get home from work I'd burst out of my car and make a bee line for the front door and turn on every light I the house because I'd feel like that deer was in there somewhere.

movies,feprsxg,t1_fepdz8q,1579329099.0,That's why it's great in this movie full of outlandish characters. The southern character is outlandishly southern to the point where he sounds like he ought to be sitting on a balcony drinking a mint julep while overlooking a plantation. He sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the regular FBI guys around him. The liberal free love character in the movie is also a stereotype and so is the ultra conservative one. It's a movie full of stereotypes played up purposefully because it's fun.
