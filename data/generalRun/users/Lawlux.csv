Nothing wrong with flashiness, but what jives me the wrong way is how GGG have actively gone against their values to keep away from overtly flashy mmo-like mtx.

MonsterHunterWorld,feme5je,t1_fem32ga,1579250826.0,"external hard drives don't actually have a very long life. Most show their age within 3 years of us and some fail or corrupt after 5+ years of use. I had an external hard drive that I used to store games and after 4 years the hard drive would momentarily fail to load game files on occasion, like audio files and textures, and it would just get progressively worse over time, with everything becoming invisible, including characters, objects, gui, and the game wouldn't recognize any input you gave either. Basically, not everything is always the game's fault, sometimes it's just our ageing tech. All you can do is alt+f4 and relaunch if that ever happens in one of your games."
