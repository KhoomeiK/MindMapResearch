SingleDads,fgsr31b,t1_fgsiezi,1581090852.0,"I hear you, but you had no choice in that matter.  We are thrust into situations that we do not create and we have to deal with them.  That is life.  The goal is to then create other situations that do NOT have this sort of impact.  Ones where we choose our path, we look ahead, we try to see the outcomes and work towards that.  Am I telling you it's impossible?  No.  I am telling you it's hard, also given what you are already dealing with, coupled with the pain of your mother ALSO being a factor.

My point is that this will only continue to be a struggle for you, and will only get harder the more involved you get with this guy.  If you didn't have some of the issues you deal with, then I'd say, ok, find a way to work with him.  But you know yourself and you are on reddit asking for advice.  Mine is simply to realize that this is likely too much for you.  I hope for the best."

It's up to nobody to judge you on what you want.  I get it, she is your daughter and we all have these notions of what we thinks should happen.  You told her mother you didn't want to be a part of this and asked for an abortion.  This is equivalent to someone donating sperm.  If a woman goes and gets in vitro, does that mean that man is the ""father""?

So, to the NAH part.  You did what most people fail at doing.  You ended things without question.  You closed the door and left nothing up for debate.  You should have told her you are not her father, just half of her gene pool, but you want no relationship with her and this is how it is done.  Now she won't linger on and wonder and be sad over the possibilities with a very, very part time dad."

She will try to hysterically bond with you.  Her whole life is about to crash down and people do whatever they can to stop it.

Remember that she kept this lie for years.  And it's likely a repeated offense.  You don't just fuck your brother-in-law out of nowhere.  They built up to this, they banged, probably repeatedly, probably in your bed, you probably sexed her right after.  It's awful and you need to stay strong.

That woman died, and you need to mourn her death.  You need to know that she is long gone and this other person is nothing to you.  Just looks the same and talks the same, but it's not the same.
