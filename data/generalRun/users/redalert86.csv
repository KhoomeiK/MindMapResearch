NoStupidQuestions,ff86v8f,t1_ff85c97,1579667672.0,Sorry new to this and probably should join a music one but cheers for the tune! I'll listen to it... :)
NoStupidQuestions,ff86r27,t1_ff85gk4,1579667574.0,Yes I know all of the above! Probably like interpol the best! My friend is a super fan lol
NoStupidQuestions,ff86coq,t1_ff85b93,1579667240.0,Anything really! I go through phases but I would say I'm mostly into trip hop right now...
socialanxiety,ff84esi,t1_ff7r2mz,1579665696.0,"Wow thank you for taking the time to write such a great comment :)
Its so reassuring to hear that there is someone out there who gets it! I don't know about you but I carry around shame with me because of my behavior and the way I am and it is really depressing. I don't want to be like this anymore...
Reading your comment though has made me think that maybe its part of the problem and I should try to accept that this is part of my life now-live with it rather than constantly fighting against it. 
I really hope your panic attacks subside soon because I know what its like and its exhausting. I got them mostly daily for around 9 months but I'm free of them now so don't loose hope! Youve got strength you don't know you have :) 
I do have a partner who is very supportive and recently we got engaged and its already decided that we are having an unconventional and rediculously small wedding so guess I'm on my way to acceptance because I know a big wedding would almost kill me off lol 
I'm sure we are both doing as much of a good job being mothers, partners and friends as anybody else but its just our pefectionist images we hold  in our heads of what we should be like makes us think we are failing in comparison. I'm sure you are doing a great job and your family and friends love you very much.

All the best for 2020 to you too!

:)"
socialanxiety,ff828mj,t1_ff7tazg,1579664074.0,Wow I'm really sorry I didnt think your first comment was real lol but reading down I understand entirely! My friend didnt loose his virginity until he was 24 and from the ages of 18-24 he just changed coz you could see it was affecting him... He's now married with a kid but I honestly think your first time' s hype is never lived up too and its makes a lot of sense to just get it done. Have you thought of maybe hookup websites rather than a hooker?
socialanxiety,ff74p4i,t1_ff73go8,1579641068.0,Thank you so much. I'm quite an empathetic person and would love to be in a job where I'm helping people so that will be where I'll start and hopefully end up in your position :) so good to hear success stories! All the best!
socialanxiety,ff70wne,t1_ff6yljn,1579638909.0,That's great... :) Good advice to get out there and try new hobbies while facing fears with the end result being you have new supportive network of friends around you which has helped you overcome your social anxiety. Thank you so much!
socialanxiety,ff6xnwy,t1_ff6spoe,1579637012.0,Aw that's fab. Can I ask how you managed to make new friends?? Lol
socialanxiety,ff6i3ex,t1_ff6gn1s,1579627675.0,Thank you so much :) all the best to you too!
socialanxiety,ff6ggr7,t1_ff6g09e,1579626670.0,That's brilliant you have the support you need. I think I'm going to try a therapist too. I guess its an uphill battle but it takes strength.
socialanxiety,ff6g7mk,t1_ff6bdq8,1579626514.0,"Such an encouraging comment as I am pretty much at that point in my life where you were when you forced yourself into work. I've been unemployed for a while now and tried college last year and failed because I was never there. I'm really so fed of it and just want to get back to some sort of normality. Maybe giving into it is just the food anxiety needs and if you force yourself to do what makes you feel uncomfortable it will starve anxiety of its food... 
Thank you for your comment! Its made me feel more positive about changing my life around :)"
socialanxiety,ff6fj1n,t1_ff6bpol,1579626088.0,That's great! So happy to hear you are now coping well with it now. I tried therapy at college but it didn't seem to work at all but maybe I should look for another therapist. I'm on meds now which help with anxiety around the house but im still pretty rubbish in social situations.
socialanxiety,ff6ajcb,t1_ff6a9if,1579622947.0,Did you get therapy at the same time?
socialanxiety,ff68ds4,t1_ff5y09i,1579621551.0,"Wow thats such a horrible thing to say to your son... Not very supportive at all. Have you ever tried explaining to your parents? My father has called me a "" bad daughter"" and is generally critical of everything I do. I really believe my father is where my  social anxiety manifested. As a child he was very distant and emotionally unavailable. He has never told me he loved me, took an interest in anything I do and made me feel extremely nervous when I'm around him- even to this day and I'm 33 now! I have never explained what social anxiety is to him because I think he would just look at me like I'm a failure and stupid and tell me just tell me to get a grip. He's very old school. I think the older generation are programmed to push their emotions deep down inside of them and wouldnt understand at all. Maybe your parents would understand? I'm new to reddit too and find this forum extremely uplifting as its so nice to hear I'm not alone and even just talking about it (I'm scared to talk to anyone about it because I guess I feel ashamed) is like I'm lifting a weight off my shoulders. 
You are not alone in this and you are not stupid or a bad son. You have a deep rooted issue (as to the rest of us) which needs a lot of love and understanding. It is an uphill battle but the battle can be won. Do you have anyone who can support you?"
socialanxiety,ff66004,t1_ff5lwar,1579619963.0,Thank you! I find it very frustrating because I feel im not living to my potential and this is not how I'm supposed to be... I struggle to be a socialable parent and worry im a bad example to my children. I struggle with failed and failed college 3 times because I was never there. I'm a rubbish friend and find any form of socialising extremely stressful. I've been on meds for almost 6 months now and feel that they have helped with anxiety at home but how do I begin to live a normal life again? Any advice as to what works for you?
socialanxiety,ff56uo8,t3_epo7gd,1579581920.0,"Fake it until you make it. Doesnt always work for me but when it does, it feels like a victory!"
socialanxiety,ff55wco,t3_eqfdmb,1579581124.0,I could have written this myself. Ive only just come to realise where the source of my anxiety has come from and after a lot of evaluation I've realised it was due being invisible to my dad or if he did talk to me it was because he had something critical to say. I never felt love from him and felt (and still feel even though I'm 33 now) very nervous in his company. I now feel this way in the company of practically anyone.
socialanxiety,ff54w0z,t3_eqmuvj,1579580313.0,I do this all the time. Its my main problem with social anxiety. I'm constantly on the look out for people who might talk to me so I can avoid them. Strangers I find easier as im less bothered by their judgement but I care about the judgement of people who know me.
socialanxiety,fekv4v1,t3_epigcp,1579208236.0,"Yes 100%. In my teenage years I never had much problem talking to anyone and at one point in my life became the life and soul of the party but now I can bearly keep eye contact with just about anyone and im an awful friend. I hate phone calls, don't post on social media and barely meet with friends. I plan to meet up and really look forward to it but when the time approaches it all feels so overwhelming and then I cancel last minute. Even if I do manage to go, I find it exhausting and pick holes in the entire night once I get home critising myself and looking for clues that my friend secretly hates me. Its a vicious circle and very depressing as this isn't who I am...this is my anxiety. Any advice would be most appreciated."
Anxietyhelp,fdohjf5,t1_fdogkji,1578605272.0,I know anxiety comes with a stigma from people who don't really understand it but sounds to me like its effecting your life so I dont see why the doctor wouldn't help you... I tried not taking meds for such a long time and I just got worse. In not ashamed to say that they have really helped change my life around and gave me the breather I needed to sort myself out. Guess everybody has their own way of dealing with it and what worked for me might not work for you but they may be worth a try... Especially since you are looking to get back to work soon. Just remember the first month isn't great so might be best starting them before you start work
Anxietyhelp,fdk8x5m,t1_fdk2121,1578498752.0,I have been totally against meds my whole adult life thinking that it was just putting a plaster on things and it would never really deal with the problem but might only make it worse. But I got a new doctor who is amazing and she suggested I take meds in order to give myself a break so that I can start rebuilding my life. The difference is like night and day. I take 20mg of citalopram every day. The first month was horrendous on them... I felt doped to the eye balls and couldn't sleep but after a while it settled down and they have made such a difference to me. I've been watching the anxiety guy on YouTube and also trying to meditate as much as possible.
