tifu,ffjufy0,t1_ffjdzga,1580007252.0,"So I was smiling after reading the story but the suicide prevention bot drew a full fledged Muttly-style heh-heh-heh. 

That's some funny stuff. 

And OP, don't do it. It might seem bad now but it'll pass over and just end up being a distant memory of the most embarrassing moment of your life. Still not worth ending it all over. 

Heh-heh-heh."
Damnthatsinteresting,ffhvzd6,t1_ffhsgbe,1579956412.0,You good. Probs only had 2nd in BC times.
australia,ffhupb5,t1_ffhr0rg,1579954781.0,"Ikr, idk where they pick their Australian music from but they somehow happen to pick the most grey, mediocre nothing music this country has to offer and ignore anything showing real promise or innovation."

australia,ffhu39o,t1_ffhojk6,1579953945.0,Hottest 100 has always had mainstream elements. It's a populist vote driven by a medium forced to pushed Australian content regardless of talent or community interest. I wish 3RRR had been doing something similar all this time so we could compare actual alternative mucis taste against Auntie's attempt at youth engagement.

WatchPeopleDieInside,ffeomk5,t1_ffdoezi,1579857615.0,This. He's a total dickhead. It's fucking chocolate milk. He should go ask his mummy to buy him some more because the mean drunk girls took it when they were having a good time as his party.

NatureIsFuckingLit,ff5fjb2,t1_ff5cckt,1579590652.0,"I agree that people get the government they deserve but I don't agree with your adjectives. Their spirit is true but damn, you spout your ideals like this and no one will take you seriously."
