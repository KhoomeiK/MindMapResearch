I definitely understand being turned off from any hypocracy when it comes to politicss. You brought up such interesting points painting the “progressive” candidates as hypocrites that I definitely plan on looking into a bit further tomorrow as I procrastinate at work lol.

Even beyond everything related to campaign financing, buttigieg has just never excited me all too much. He seems pretty par for the course all the way around. But you’ve definitely convinced me to open my mind back up and read into him a bit more than I already have.

But for real right on for all that info and for providing your view point on things. I plan to explore those links more and in depth and try to substantiate some of what you said with my own research tomorrow"

But for real though. I see bassecko post on here a lot. Seen him dig up some obscure old school bassnectar related stuff and whatnot, he’s clearly a huge fan. I had seen him post about wanting to go to a nectar show before but never being able to, this set just happens to be in his city so I’ll be dammed if $60 is what prevents him from being able to go so I figured I’d offer to help. Ultimately he hasn’t reached out to me to take me up on it so far, so we’ll see if it happens. Offer certainly stands though"
bassnectar,ffuz544,t1_ffuyoff,1580252133.0,Yea I chose to focus on all the people that expressed interest rather than try to defend nectar to a bunch of ransoms. His sound isn’t for everyone and that’s fair
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffuxmnl,t1_ffuvw4l,1580251290.0,Celebrities deserve privacy too. Taking their picture when they’re at an event or whatever? Obviously that’s fine. Creeping on their house and trying to catch them in places where they have an expectation of privacy is not fine

Really not concerned about the price as long as its not ridiculous, which it won’t be. I can’t look up the exact price now as apparently it’s only on sale for loyalty customers and I don’t have the right code.

As I said before, don’t worry about ticket price or fees or whatever, if you can make all other aspects workout for this, then I’d be happy to help as far as the ticket goes. The general on sale is this Friday, work it all out by then and we’ll figure out a way to get you the ticket"
politics,ffujcp7,t1_ffugd1l,1580243182.0,"So I remember reading that for awhile he was the only candidate that was still accepting money from registered lobbyists, and then he decided to not do that and returned some chunk of money to those people. Which is great, but sort of goes against your point that his policy hasn’t changed since he launched his campaign. Then there’s articles [like this one](https://www.google.com/amp/s/prospect.org/api/amp/politics/did-pete-buttigieg-get-hidden-campaign-support-from-real-estate-developer/), that seem to indicate there’s still a bit of shadiness in his fundraising tactics that leave me a little uneasy and struggling to fully trust him.

As for those groups you mentioned that Bernie takes money from, ive honestly never heard of them. I’ll have to look more into them later once I’m off work and have a bit more time"

I don’t live in that area and won’t be able to go to this show, so I can’t provide a squad or anything for you to see it with. But if you’re down to either go alone or know people to go with, and just can’t afford the ticket yourself, let me know. Like for real DM me and we’ll figure this shit out"

politics,ffuevog,t1_ffub4ny,1580240495.0,"Yea I think you’re right that we just have differing opinions for what we consider dirty politics, as your major gripe doesn’t bother me much at all, as long as they aren’t lying when they say it.

My primary issue lies in politicians taking corporate money and doing the will the of their corporate donors disguising it as though they’re actually helping the common man. Almost all politicians, in both parties, are guilty of this, and I’m absolutely sick of it. Buttigieg doesn’t seem any worse than the average politician goes as far as this is concerned, he just seems more par for the course which is enough to annoy me. Where Bernie has made it a very loudly stated point that he is against this and will attempt to fix this area if he were elected."

I’ve never really seen anything about Bernie that made me feel that way though, care to point out some examples of what he’s done that has upset you?

I also totally get what you mean by some of his supporters turning you off, but I don’t really see that as a negative towards Bernie himself, anybody eith as many supporters as Bernie has is gonna attract some obnoxious people.

I am a fan of yang as well though, he’s definitely my second choice, I just don’t think he has much of a chance to win"

HumansBeingBros,ffthuem,t1_fft5ndo,1580220943.0,"My girlfriend has 2 inhalers and anti depressants. She had a long instance where she didn’t have insurance because she couldn’t hold a job due to an issue she has with her shoulder acting up whenever she does physical activity. We had to go through this charity clinic in order to get her inhalers. She went without her anti depressants for a very long time because we couldn’t find a way to get those covered, until we finally got her qualified for a program through the manufacturer. There were many nights where she was so depressed and would go to bed barely able to breathe all because we couldn’t afford to get her medicine, if it wasn’t due to charitable organizations she probably wouldn’t be here. I’m glad your situation is working out fairly painlessly, but it’s not the case for everyone in this country.
