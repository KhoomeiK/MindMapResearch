A lot of expensive food is also pretty fucking overrated as well considering the price but people don't complain because you're not going to a fancy restaurant for the food, you're going *because it's a fancy restaurant*. The job of a sommelier is to provide the ability to conspicuously consume highly expensive products and to be EXCLUSIVE while doing so. 

If I'm getting my wine pairings and recommendations from a sommelier I am better than you because you probably drink Champagne with chocolate cake and are therefore a fucking fool compared to me. I don't really give a shit about the wine; I just want to be better than you. Sommeliers give me a myriad of reasons why I am better than you and have in fact created an entire self-consistent universe of wine-related rules of which only they are the expert gatekeepers to."

Otherwise you qualify that statement and say ""I don't eat pork but I'm not strict on the hescher"" or whatever the fuck.

This is relatively common in Reform Judaism and is obviously not going to be as big a thing in other denominations.

They're also obviously culturally appropriating at this point if they care so little that the only reason they're a ""Jewish"" deli is because they serve pastrami.

the concept of /r/TheRedPill and the black pill is only the top 20% or 10% of men (alpha males) actually have sex nowadays and that women categorize men into three categories, ""alpha fucks"" who they want to have sex with, ""beta bucks"" who are only good for providing money or goods or services or being an ""emotion tampon"", and those who don't fall into either which are incels. Then average woman follows a lifestyle where she has sex with ""alpha fucks"" in her teens and 20s, then when she's thirty she's finally ready to ""settle down"" and marry a ""betabux"".

The ideology between the two then splits in their respective responses when confronted with this view of the world. /r/TheRedPill is focusing on changing yourself into an ""alpha fucks"" from a ""beta bucks"" or below and that the realistic end-game in today's world is joining the top 20% and essentially building up a harem of non-exclusive booty calls for most of your life. ""Self improvement"" means going to the gym, getting big, and improving your value while never committing to any women and using them solely for sexual encounters. Marriage is out of the picture.

The ""black pill"" which is what OP was really referring to is the idea that you are either born an alpha fucks aka ""Chad"" or a betabux/incel. If you were not born a ""Chad"", there is nothing you can do to self-improve or change your position in this hierarchy aside from deciding whether or not you're a ""betabux"".

AmItheAsshole,fewtnz5,t1_fewhwll,1579419325.0,It's really really easy to fake screenshots so it can be difficult to use screenshots in an official capacity. The DA shouldn't care about these screenshots at all if they're doing a good job because literally anyone can fake a Facebook post with inspect element to say outrageous things in a way indistinguishable from an actual post when screenshotted. It would be easy for a disgruntled ex or family member or whatever to have been the one to send these screenshots; fabricated so that they look like the drunk driver is a horrible person. Or make a fake profile to make these comments to tar their reputation.
AmItheAsshole,fewhoq9,t3_eqqya8,1579410765.0,For it to be useful you'd probably have to testify as to the accuracy of it or the DA would have to subpoena Facebook to get the evidence.

AmItheAsshole,fewc8oh,t1_fevu046,1579408259.0,"you're not entitled to deceive someone into having sex because you think their reasoning is wrong or abhorrent. If you lie to your SO and your relationship was conditional on that lie *you're morally in the wrong* and may have even committed rape by deception.

It DOES NOT MATTER WHAT THE REASON IS. You are NOT entitled to a relationship if you have to obtain through deceit/lying. Consent is consent and if you lied to gain that consent IT IS NOT CONSENT. You're fully entitled to not have a relationship with someone based on their ideas about virginity or whatever else about their beliefs pisses you off. But you are NOT entitled to be deceptive and lie about your virginity status so you can be in a relationship with that person.

It's not hard to understand. If someone only wants to have sex with women who are virgins, then you are committing RAPE by deception if you lie about your sexual past so the person will have sex with you. 

Maybe society does or doesn't need the social construct of virginity. Maybe it's bullshit and you disagree with it existing at all. That doesn't matter here. This guy believes that Lauren has maintained and currently has a ""virginal"" status. Lauren does NOT have such a status. Lauren is deceiving and lying to coax someone into a relationship. That is abuse. If Lauren ever has sex with this guy, it will be RAPE based on deception.

OP is an asshole for not telling Jake directly, as this isn't an issue that should be public for a variety of reasons such as OP possibly being wrong for example. But Lauren is also indisputably 100% an asshole for lying to Jake so she can be in a relationship with him.

None of this really matters though anyways as this is subreddit is just soap opera for the internet age distilled to the best part: the interpersonal conflicts between people.

It also hits all of Reddit's sweet spots. They're (white) Evangelical Christians so it's fun to hate on their beliefs. Then we have ""Lauren"". She's either a stock character of a washed up slut who's prettied herself up so she can finally find a ""good man"" or alternatively a woman who wants to forget the mistakes of her past and is just trying to get a better life with the guy she loves. This preys upon Reddit's dual audience of feminists who believe ""virginity is a social construct"" and manospherists who believe virginity is important to have in a partner. Plus the situation is vague enough that it's possible to make all sorts of assumptions that the new boyfriend is a beta cuck or that ""Lauren"" is a ""born-again virgin"" despite both being baseless assumptions of fact.

It also flips the situation by having a woman deceive a man into having sex, which means commenters are baited into making statements inconsistent with their beliefs. Guys who would lie about their financial status/credit history to their partners to ""avoid gold diggers"" are pissed off about this woman who lies about her sexual history with endless justifications about how they're not the same. Then feminists who oppose deception or lies in a relationship context are OK with this one because ""virginity isn't real it's a social construct"" and ""nobody is entitled to know my sexual history"" or ""it doesn't matter anyways how many people someone's had sex with beforehands"".

Then there's OP, someone who's somehow not really into Lauren's church but also is aware that Lauren and Jake are a well-known couple over there. Or Lauren's previous relationship is well-known enough that she posted on Facebook about her pregnancy but somehow Jake doesn't know about any of this. The biggest inconsistency though is that Lauren and Jake (25 years old) would CO-OPERATIVELY lead a sexual purity themed retreat for the church youth group. I don't think a church would hold a co-ed youth retreat for sexual purity. Plus an unmarried couple wouldn't be openly going to this sort of overnight event together. They'd be separate.

Lastly, OP is the perfect proxy for us, the audience, because we both are privy to reams of information about this interpersonal conflict but are also completely uninvolved aside from commenting or telling someone that they're a bad person for what they've done. And OP's entire action that we're deciding is good or bad is effectively making a comment on someone's post saying ""you're the asshole"" for deceiving your boyfriend."

Kamikaze pilot is still alive, your kid is 17 and you're in your 30s. In both cases there's something that's unclear/irregular. Former kamikaze pilots typically wouldn't be alive and most people don't have kids in their mid to late teens. In both cases what you're supposed to do is *not* acknowledge the obvious irregularity/unusual situation and pretend like everything is normal.

They want a rough map. So you just tell the burger that ""felony = indictable, misdemeanor = summary, infraction = provincial"" and don't really get into the detail of how those don't exactly map up to American criminal law.

Most Americans don't understand that the Canadian Dollar is actually worth less than the American Dollar and fluctuates in price. In fact they probably don't even know what the fuck you're talking about with ""provinces"" and might think that there's a literal guy with a Crown who does the prosecutions.

So it's easier to just use American terms on Reddit so you successfully communicate 90% of your point that the DA in Toronto, Canada has secured felony convictions for breaking into an ice hockey arena than to explain that the Crown can prosecute an indictable offense if you use your lockpicks to break into the local hydro station to use the washroom because Americans don't know what ""the Crown, indictable offense, hydro, or washroom"" mean."

Sometimes you just have to pretend there is nothing abnormal about a situation where there clearly is because the explanation would likely be embarassing. This is one of those situations. You shouldn't act surprised or ""I wouldn't expect you to have a daughter that old!"" because it's awkward/uncomfortable to have to explain it was a teen pregnancy or was pretty young. Despite the fact it's easily inferrable from the facts/ages it's still impolite to make someone explain it.

Also ""YTA"" doesn't mean you're *an* asshole in general. It means you were the asshole in this situation. This was probably an honest mistake on your part on not figuring out the social expectation in this type of situation but you were still the asshole in this encounter. Don't get someone to explain obvious inconsistencies because a majority of the time they don't want to explain because it's awkward/difficult.

What I do know is that someone who is the same age but doesn't have that level of following is probably worth even less and therefore brings much less value to a brand/app/whatever. People get paid for sponsored posts based on how much value the sponsored post brings in.

Secondly, acknowledging that young girls do this is not disgusting because it's true. Young girls quite often exploit their sexuality to make money on the internet. It's called ""pedobaiting""  and up to a year ago for example there were numerous young girls offering on fiverr to be someone's ""Roblox GF"" or whatever because they've discovered they can make money off of what is effectively online sex work despite not even fully comprehending what sex is yet. Is it a repugnant and disgusting practice? Yes. I abhor it and it should be wiped off the internet (which thanks to SESTA/FOSTA a lot of it has as user reports now create liability if companies don't take it down). But it is NOT disgusting to acknowledge that this practice exists and that young girls sexualize themselves on the internet for money.

I have a brother the same as the girl in the OP and he's successfully developed an Instagram page with over 100k followers without divulging ANY personal information whatsoever. But he only makes maybe $10 from a sponsored post on a good day. And it took him YEARS to develop the connections and fanbase he needed to do crosspromotions/etc. He's also pretty fucking smart as well.
