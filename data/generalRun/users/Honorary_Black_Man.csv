60% is a passing score, my friend. 

Although your workplace will try to convince you that there’s a grading scale by using annual reviews and promising incentives, I promise you those incentives are worth less than a $0.50/hr raise. Your work is pass/fail. The people “grading” you are probably not only disconnected from your work, but they actually won’t even be technical enough to understand it, and they probably won’t even fully understand how to access it.

American workplaces are exploitative popularity contests and pissing matches full of blatant nepotism and the best way to advance in them is to merely never, ever, EVER admit to doing something wrong (as HR will use your guilt against you if they are at all able to do so) and finding a new one every few years."

I see it as fucking heroic and liberating when someone breaks these groomed habits.

Go the fuck home when your day is done. You’re provisioning emails, not storming the beaches at Normandy. Even though you might get a pat on the shoulder for being a workhorse, you’re not actually going to get rewarded for it.

Not only does using that strategy stupid, but it means you’re literally hurting your fellow workers by sending a message to your employer that someone out there is always willing to be exploited. Exploit they will.

A picture, a will or gift affidavit, even an old letter that mentions the coins and explains how the previous owner came in possession of them.

Also, not sure if $300k worth of old coins counts, but usually anything and everything in the house at the time the mortgage begins is the new owner's property.  If the previous owner leaves a couch at the house and then you throw it out, it's not like they can sue you for the cost of the couch because they signed a legally-binding agreement that they get their shit out by X date or they forfeit their shit.

Considering how valuable the coins are though, there may be an exception to that rule. If they can actually prove that they had some sort of relation to those coins, other than just happening to live in the house where they were hidden, then you probably owe them some dough.  But unless they can actually prove it, I don't see why you'd take it on face value.

Also, just a guess, but when Nixon was President he demanded that most of the gold in the US be handed over to the US government.  There were literally G-men going to people's homes and taking their gold jewelry.  Perhaps someone's grandparent stashed the coins away at that time to hide them from the government and then took the secret to their grave.

The Navy has been tracking these things for decades. Pilots who have done so personally have been on Joe Rogan taking about it for hours straight. Supposedly there are Navy Generals who spend large amounts of their careers tracking them. It’s not classified, it’s just thay the public knows just as much about them as the military does, so what’s to report on?  Nothing, we have no info. The reason the military doesn’t want to make a big deal of it is because it would be an open admission that these things enter and leave our airspace at will and we don’t even know what they are. 

For the record, almost all of the legitimate UFO sightings from the military involve “pill shaped” vehicles. The most well-known report comes from a 2003 recording taken by a pilot who was aboard the USS Nimitz, but they’ve been occurring intermittently, and the same crafts have been spotted in 2019. They’ve even jammed electronics and forced pilots to eject from their jets. They’ve been seen submersing themselves underwater. Radar hasn’t been able to reliably track them for more than a few seconds at a time. They’ve been observed moving at least 80,000mph and do sharp turns at those speeds which would certainly kill a human pilot instantly. They also move vertically. They have no observable means of propulsion.

I can’t prove it, and on this topic I am generally very skeptical, but based upon what I’ve read and heard I am all but convinced that these pill-shaped UFOs are intelligently controlled by something technologically superior to contemporary man."

Showerthoughts,feel8am,t1_fee1ymw,1579036017.0,"It’s called computer programming and learning it will literally break you as a human. Sure, with your superior logic and reasoning skills you’ll be able to reassemble the pieces but it will take years of fear and self-doubt and by the time you’re done gluing your life will have irrevocably changed. You’ll be forced into the realization that your average fellow man is only logical 10% of the time and then you’ll learn that less than 1% of them have any desire to improve this. You’ll know that objective truth often takes a backseat to opinion, ego, and whatever is fashionable in the moment.

But yes, you will be able to surf reddit for a fatty paycheck and, unless you’re straight out of school (in which case you’re going to be abused as a workhorse while other people do nothing) no one will be able to do anything about it because they simply don’t understand what you do.
