I enjoy initial startup stuff, so once it's running smooth I move on to a new zoo"

My birthday is tomorrow, my coworkers went out of their way to make it nice, my workload isn't bad, I got all my stuff done, my friends and happy and healthy, I have enough food, I'm safe, I'm warm and dry even though it's storming, and I feel loved. 

Also caffeinated.

Maybe if I was done with work for the day and my friends were also off work so we could spend time together. This is the first time in a decade that my birthday hasn't been a horrific shitshow, my therapy is working and my depression has let up a bit.

It's pretty close to 100%. If it stays like this the rest of the day I'll mark it as a win."

fatlogic,fchzma1,t1_fceucwl,1577656007.0,"Just venting here but I've found since I've started eating intuitively (asking myself if I'm hungry or just wanna taste of something, am I hungry or just don't want to waste the food on my plate) I've realized just how BIG portions are. A few bites will satiate the hunger but holy shit does it taste good and I'll keep eating. It's so frustrating. But I guess with all things it gets easier with practice. Moderation can be hard when we're creatures that eat socially and food is designed to be delicious"
