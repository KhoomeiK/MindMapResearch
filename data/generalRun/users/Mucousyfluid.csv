52weeksofcooking,ffrxxf3,t3_eusrd5,1580168414.0,This is what I was going to do and then turn it into Shuba for Russian week in reverse order! I won't be able to pull it off this pretty though.
toddlers,ffqufhf,t3_eugp3e,1580143886.0,"Stainless steel ladle checking in. He calls it his ""light"" and was super upset when I drew the line at taking it to school."

millionairemakers,fepviz3,t3_eq81a8,1579332815.0,So you're sayin' there's a chance!
todayilearned,feln2y8,t1_felf0yy,1579226118.0,"I read this super dumb book when I was a kid and there was a wizard with a lisp who had a lot of trouble because he couldn't say the magic words! I should hit up r/tipofmytongue. It was about a kid who killed dragons. He shot a flaming arrow into the dragon's mouth when they sucked in air to shoot their flames and they'd explode. I was like ten so it may have been terrible, but I remember enjoying it."
52weeksofcooking,feimaap,t1_fegila4,1579141851.0,"Oooh, I just started dabbling in fermentation past sourdough. Kvass is on the list of things I'm excited about. Any tips or pitfalls you've picked up along the way?"
52weeksofcooking,fefuu1s,t1_fctdyn4,1579065916.0,I'm thinking yogurt.
52weeksofcooking,fefuraz,t1_fdk78io,1579065844.0,Are you thinking of making a Russian black bread and then turning it into Kvass? Cause I was just patting myself on the back for thinking of that and a fermentation theme.
MurderedByWords,fdwkcgd,t1_fdwjklp,1578759607.0,"We just got a transfer switch for the generator. We're under too many trees for solar I think, but we're looking into it once we have some more cash on hand."
todayilearned,fdwi6nd,t1_fdvz2o2,1578758876.0,Sidelying! It's basically the only way I feed my second kid. It's the laziest breastfeeding position and I am the laziest mother.
MurderedByWords,fdt0bqw,t1_fdt04dj,1578710274.0,Truth.
MurderedByWords,fdsjucn,t1_fdsc163,1578704063.0,The Santa Cruz Mountains are affordable if you don't mind being out of power for weeks at a time. The commute may not even be that bad. Ours went from an hour in stop and go traffic to an hour on beautiful mountain passes.
Breadit,fdpab3j,t1_fdp2xv9,1578623680.0,Naw you gotta add listeria from week-old lettuce.
toddlers,fdoujyi,t1_fdom3b2,1578613201.0,Your older kid is the perfect age for her Playing Preschool curriculum. It's super great for bringing structure to your day and it's incredibly low effort. Having a book and two related activities ready to go every day has been life-changing.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fdftgfh,t1_fdfag9q,1578369776.0,"I remember the Verizon in calling and texting ""are you... IN?""  

Would only half jokingly tell people we couldn't be friends if they weren't on verizon so the texts were free."
todayilearned,fd5ownw,t1_fd4jf4q,1578179820.0,"But some kids have colic, some parents have PPD, sometimes breastfeeding isn't possible... There are certainly always complicating factors and the guy experienced what he experienced. I just don't want doom and gloom to be the only voice at the table."
todayilearned,fd5dl3h,t1_fd4ivl6,1578176588.0,"I'm just some schmuck though. I think it's a combination of luck and tenacity more than anything. The little one is six months now and the big one is in preschool nine hours a week. It's still hard sometimes, for sure, but it isn't like this guy described by any means."
todayilearned,fd3x6b7,t1_fd3qhpg,1578162378.0,"This is one single perspective and it is valid. That said, I worked full time from home with no daycare, no help from family, and two under two. It was stressful sometimes, yeah, but it isn't necessarily the nightmare hellscape described above.  

I'm not discounting your experience. It sounds like you had a really hard time, but that isn't always the situation."
Breadit,fd3btr8,t1_fd20ohc,1578156750.0,You're right! I'm thinking of the Classic Sourdoughs book I wish I hadn't bought! Thanks!
