SelfAwarewolves,fftdiou,t1_fft5dsl,1580217338.0,"Ah sorry, with ya now. Yeah that's true. And now we have so many more ways to enter said chambers."
SelfAwarewolves,fft58mq,t1_fft4ijx,1580207786.0,"Nah, I reckon it's OK to get upset about human rights violations or the destruction of the climate resulting in worsening living conditions, or worsening economic conditions that mean young people will be worse off than their parents for the first time ever. I think those things are ok to get upset about."
SelfAwarewolves,fft3nqx,t1_fft15vh,1580205364.0,Yep. Nothing is as soft as a conservative commentator these days.
videos,ffs4ofg,t1_ffrp5yl,1580173053.0,"The problem, which we will never know, is maybe they'd done these scud runs a million times before with no issues.

It doesn't matter if you've done it a million times safely if the one time you don't kills you. Cause you don't know when that killer one will be."
technology,ffq0g4h,t1_ffomp7p,1580113664.0,Yeah civilians are cheaper than military people. There's a lot of upkeep with uniformed members. You don't have to train civilians how to shoot for example. Every Marine a rifleman and all that guff.
ihavesex,ffq029g,t1_ffpry26,1580113124.0,"I dunno man, would be an awesome troll if he did. And just ended up being a suburban dad or something."

BattlefieldV,ffpqpe5,t1_ffpomii,1580102357.0,"The problem is, if they are good pilots they are ready for that. I just do what I can and hope there aren't any good players on the other side when I fly."
canberra,ffl0pu6,t3_eu2acz,1580032676.0,"Could be worse. Male Funnel Webs are on the move right now in the Sydney area. At least we don't get those fucks down here.

OldSchoolCool,ffk9xxy,t1_ffju7ab,1580019359.0,I just finished it about 5mins ago. No idea how I'd not read it before. Amazing stuff.
OldSchoolCool,ffjq03y,t1_ffj8i1l,1580004027.0,Yeah it's a bit like that. Eugene Sledge mentions in his book his hatred of coconut after having to clean up tonnes of rotting coconuts while stationed on Pavuvu. I'd dislike it too after what he went through.
politics,ffjphcc,t1_ffjov87,1580003682.0,"I hope so, but I'm not feeling confident."
politics,ffjonk2,t1_ffjhvvc,1580003119.0,"You're missing the key thing. He's turned it totally tribal now. So long as he wins, so long as he beats the other side, no one on his side gives a shit."
straya,ffhtfju,t1_ffhpm4e,1579953000.0,Yeah any song will get annoying if it's getting thrashed all day.
straya,ffhh6j8,t3_etkbsy,1579935066.0,"You know how you occasionally find someone who's not seen Star Wars or never watched an episode of GoT? That's me with Dance Monkey. I, shit you not, had to Google it listen to it after people started complaining about it. I've never heard it anywhere."
bikecommuting,ffgxlbi,t1_fff6ld7,1579917656.0,There's a Strava segment on my commute called Windy Grasslands of Death. That should give you a good idea of the bad times of my commute lol.
gatekeeping,ffgqbpu,t1_ffg8kd5,1579912353.0,I've used similar things and they aren't too bad. Pod machines are pretty popular here. Like a Keurig but without the shitty DRM. They are what I use these days as they are as convenient as instant but much better tasting.
gatekeeping,ffe35zx,t1_ffddlfu,1579835489.0,"Yeah its like that. A guy I work with, who's normally a pretty cool guy, is nuts when it comes to cars/electronics. He's a VW/Sony fan boy so anything that's not that gets shit on immediately.

It's funny to egg him on though, lol."
gatekeeping,ffe2tjp,t1_ffddq56,1579835231.0,"You'd be surprised. I'm Australian, and we make the bst coffee in the world, but my mum still prefers Nescafe Blend 43. It's not the bottom of the pile for instant coffee but it's pretty close. Some people just like what they like."
AbruptChaos,ff8oeg7,t1_ff8ei3h,1579688804.0,Dunno the context but there are MANY feral cats in Australia. Even non feral ones don't get a whole lot of sympathy over the way they've decimated small native wildlife here.
AbruptChaos,ff8o7ki,t1_ff8er46,1579688510.0,"Hmm my Alaskan Malamute would like to have a word with you over that. We had to call the police over a matter and my boxer x ridgeback was uber protective of us when they came inside, but my Mal just went straight up to them, no barks and gave them hella love. She's like that with everyone."
australia,ff7vhjf,t1_ff7rkan,1579659329.0,Yup. I shouldn't be complaining though cause Labor stuck FTTP in Gungahlin to pork barrel us to vote for them. It's worked of course.
australia,ff7vc8v,t1_ff7qvfo,1579659230.0,"Yeah I saw that last night. It's not a good look. He needs to hit up Warnie for some Advanced Hair (yeah, yeah)."
canberra,ff4yxin,t1_ff4oz97,1579575808.0,I got $30 for a guy to take away my Hyundai Excel.
australia,ff4uvgb,t1_ff4ppn1,1579573002.0,Yep. Even APS. My SES mentioned to me that bosses like to see you move every 2 to 3 years so you get a good breadth of different roles.
HistoryMemes,ff4qriu,t1_ff4ntiv,1579570188.0,"Bro, a 50 year old started at the FBI in 1990 (assuming they were 20 when they started)."

canberra,ff2sbgp,t1_ff2atqm,1579521996.0,Yeah up here in Gunners we had none at all.
facepalm,ff2jht7,t1_ff29ha2,1579508942.0,"And why incels have problems seeing women as real people, instead of walking sex machines."
combinedgifs,ff2j3u7,t1_ff2hrdt,1579508419.0,That's actually really cool and a lot less obnoxious than someone walking around a popular flower show with a camera man and a guy holding a reflector.
MTB,fepwvck,t1_fepc3rr,1579333784.0,That did not sound good either!! Nice jumping before though.

Shitty video but sound on my dude. That's me breaking my wrist and cracking 4 vertebrae."
bikecommuting,fembs05,t3_epu25w,1579247620.0,My city just took a bunch of these type of intersections out cause they are so dangerous. Drivers don't bother to look. So they took away their option to go unless they have a green light.
BattlefieldV,fembj3u,t1_felpp1t,1579247305.0,"Hamada is pretty gnarly though as a pilot. I got lost 5 times and crashed into the ground or out of bounds just taking off from G.

Fjell gets it about right."
space,fem8yio,t1_feliwmp,1579244137.0,A Talent for War by Jack Mcdevitt has this as a central plot device. Humans are getting walloped by aliens and plan to lure them into a star system and then have a ship materialise inside the systems sun. The neutron payload thus making it nova and then decimate the aliens.
