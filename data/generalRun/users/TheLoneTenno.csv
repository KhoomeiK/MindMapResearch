In both cases, Iâ€™ve lost to the dude who ended up winning the tournament. In both cases, itâ€™s given me insight on what Iâ€™m doing wrong. 

In the second tournament, it was at a convention that only happens once a year. I asked the dude if he wanted to mirror match (which Iâ€™m horrible at) since we both mained 2B. He stomped my ass. I got to talk to him afterword and hearing him talk about everything is what drives me to get better. It made me realize that I had so much to learn and that I wanted to get better so that this year I can hold my own against him. 

**My point is that even if youâ€™re a casual player, go to tournaments. It shows support for the community. Even if you get stomped, it forces you to look at what youâ€™re doing wrong. And if itâ€™s the case of being a local tournament, you usually get to talk to the people that beat you and they will usually be willing to help you.**"
