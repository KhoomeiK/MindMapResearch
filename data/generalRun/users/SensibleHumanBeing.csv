""Think about it. The frame was leaked is high res. This means that it can't be a thumbnail and can't have just been recently uploaded and forgotten to be privated because youtube has to encode.

Additionally, there would be so much more then one frame flying around if it was actually posted to YouTube because so many people have notifications on.

Which means the only explanation is that iLG has some source (mole) inside Respawn who leaked that frame to him."""
