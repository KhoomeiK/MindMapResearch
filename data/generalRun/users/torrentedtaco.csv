Well, they lie to and manipulate each other every damn episode and always make up at the end of the episode like ""uh, I should've told you the entire time, but I was scaaaared ::("" or something.       
They can't talk to each other about their feelings about something until the situation completely escalates (like thinking the other cheated) and oh, what a surprise they feel the same thing or are super supportive anyway. This compassion is only possible in the last 2 minutes of an episode for them.        
They get jealous when something good happens to the other one, they have pissing contests about the dumbest shit, they're bad friends to their friends and bad parents to their daughter, which they find fucking hilarious apparently (""we don't know shit about our daughter hahahaha"").          
They do the same shit over and over and over again and say they'll better themselves every damn time but THEY. NEVER. DO."
