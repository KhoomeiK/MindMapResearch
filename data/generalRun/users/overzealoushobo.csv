PSVR,ff6cq91,t1_ff6bqvt,1579624344.0,"I finally splurged (and it is def a splurge) and bought an aim gun.  It is just so fun, it makes me giggle like a child.  The Doom experience you're talking about is there with the aim gun.  It has the satisfaction of the movement speed from typical Doom(once you get all the settings right), but with the joy of old school arcade shooters.  It's just so satisfying shooting demons in the face with a shotgun you feel gripped in your hands.  Other games I have for it are:

* **Arizona Sunshine:** Fun with friends, fun in ""hoard modes"". Def worth playing with the gun- maybe not so much without.

* **Borderlands 2 VR:** Hated this without aim, love it with aim.

* **Farpoint:** Just a solid single player game, so many jaw dropping moments.

* **Firewall Zero Hour:** Very fun multi- think rainbow 6.  Can be a little janky, but once you're in, the experience is amazing.

* **Evasion:** (pretty well dead, but there is fun to be had against A.I)

The biggest standout here in my opinion (for single player) is Farpoint.  Such a joy to play."
