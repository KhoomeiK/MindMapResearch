CatAdvice,ffiefgv,t3_etruz1,1579971900.0,"We had a cat who had persistent sneezing and was on/off antibiotics for years. I generally got most concerned when she had large amounts of ooze coming from the eyes as I did not want the infection to cost her an eye. She would occasionally throw up a white mucus too, I never considered that dire. Some cats unfortunately suffer from these persistent illnesses after once contracting it. Luckily it was never something that spread to our other cat and he even groomed her daily. It seems like you are treating it the best you can and we took the same approach as you since it never really went away, more like periods that it was dormant. I did feel bad for her, but we did all we could to keep her comfortable."

In 1995, director Steve James (of 'Hoop Dreams') returned to rural Southern Illinois to reconnect with Stevie Fielding, a troubled young boy to whom he had been an ""Advocate Big Brother"" ten years earlier.  
 He began a film, a search, to discover not only what had happened to Stevie over the past ten years but to understand the forces that had shaped his entire life. Part way through the filming, Stevie is arrested and charged with a serious crime that tears his family apart. What was to be a modest profile turns into a intimate four and half year chronicle of Stevie, his broken family, the criminal justice system and the filmmaker himself, as they all struggle with what Stevie has done and who he has become."

We were told Bandit was between 8-10, but his high energy, impulsive behavior and physical fitness indicates otherwise. Which makes its difficult because we were expecting a cat with a lower energy level like our 10 year old resident cat (who had always gotten along with other cats). I don’t think Bandit ever lived with other cats and doesn’t seem to know hissing means back down. Or he is trying to assert himself as alpha cat by not ignoring the hissing. Maybe it’s just some cat politics I don’t understand, but it looks more like he just wants to play then be the dominate cat.  We have an enclosed playpen that we have used to help introduce them and new cat never complains about being in there which makes me think he was crate trained or something. My resident cat would cry his head off it put in the playpen. And it’s nice and spacious with a blanket and bed."

CatAdvice,fefd5as,t3_eor7bx,1579053755.0,I was surprised at how nice the accommodations can be at some of the dog boarding facilities.

Usually if you spray them once or twice then the third time just shaking it is enough.

Like something his size he can bite and rough House with or soft plush balls that he can attack when we throw them down the hallway.

I think they remember one another. We just got a new cat and it’s been like a month for my resident cat to start to accept him. So there is quite a difference when they already have a history together in my experience."
CatAdvice,fcrhyg2,t3_eibnwh,1577902053.0,"We are dealing with a very similar issue and it is very stressful. We did all the same things you have done and it’s been a slow month without them even in the same room yet. I did get this pop-up dog pen to put one cat in while the other roams the house. That has helped with the introduction. I finally went to the vet the other day and she said we are doing everything right. They decided to put our more aggressive cat on Prozac to help with the introduction and to hopefully keep the fights from getting out of hand. It has already greatly improved the situation. The vet said there will still likely be some fighting and they will work it out as cats, but we want to make sure no one gets hurt. I have been harness training my one cat too, so we can keep him from chasing our cat who likes to run. Good luck!"
