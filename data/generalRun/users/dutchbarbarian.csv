Second, get some kind of polishing creme, gently rub it in with a old/clean towel. If it doesn't fix it just let a car repair shop take a look at it and pay for it yourself.

IndustrialDesign,fel6y20,t3_epozr4,1579215379.0,"30 for an idea? Assuming it's such a good idea you get to present it and somebody actually listens... No don't sell it for 30 dollars...

Now tell me, wouldnt you rather exploit this idea yourself? Scrap some money together, find a suitable business partner, test the idea/product till you really really really can't find any flaws anymore, and just launch that sucker. This is business, don't go selling your potentially thousand dollar idea for 30 bucks!
