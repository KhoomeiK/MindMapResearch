CallOfDutyMobile,ffhi92g,t1_ffha9ec,1579936440.0,They ruined zombies. It’s clear not many people play it since they moved the location of the button to go to the zombie lobby and it doesn’t have any tier challenges this season so far
CallOfDutyMobile,ffhhxay,t3_etmgga,1579936012.0,"Take it as a lesson. The chance for the gun is 1% and the chance for the skin is .08% chance on the first spin. Some people are bound to hit it on the first couple tries but 99% aren’t. The posts here showing off how lucky people get are stupid and should be banned because they are essentially advertisements. They convince people like you to try your luck even though the odds are that you won’t get it until the final spin or two. 

Unlike you, I’m not a broke student. I have the money to buy them all if I wanted to but I refuse to pay into a system like this. I’ll buy the pass but that’s it. It’s a waste of money. No virtual item that has no intrinsic value is worth 100s of dollars, regardless of how ‘cool’ the item is."
CallOfDutyMobile,ffhhm7f,t1_ffhcrel,1579935614.0,Spoken like a true gambling addict. Just spend a little more money and I’ll surely hit it big.
CallOfDutyMobile,ffhhjxc,t1_ffhctvm,1579935534.0," Nothing will happen to them currently but the us government needs to take a serious look at what is essentially kids gambling with real money. It obvious that the target demographic are younger kids between 13-20. To my knowledge there is no msrb rating in codm that would prevent kids under 18 from being subjected to these gambling mechanics like console cod games have with the m rating. in that sense, something could be done to take out or change the lootbox system. Then again, these gaming companies probably have lobbyists and pay off representatives to look the other way."
CODZombies,ffh8s46,t1_ffg45pl,1579926382.0,Fire get me kil.
CODZombies,ffh8f8o,t1_ffh6wuk,1579926075.0,If you camp like that it goes a lot quicker but training takes a lot longer. Took me about 10 hours to get to 100 on de by training with the wolf bow. I did the EE too though
CODZombies,ffh8alw,t1_fffz8fq,1579925964.0,Definitely revelations is the easiest I got to 90 easily but got tired and didn’t want to leave my PlayStation on. Laid down in bed and played until 95 while dozing off repeatedly before I finally died. De is the most fun for high rounds because you can adjust your playstyle from camping with lightning bow to training with wolf bow.
CODZombies,ffh6if1,t1_ffgp4u6,1579924474.0,Yeah there needs to be a challenge
CallOfDutyMobile,ffgwm2n,t1_ffgvxbh,1579916924.0,That explains a lot then. It costs like 115$ here. How much are crates where you are and the battle pass
CallOfDutyMobile,ffgvpo2,t1_ffgvm3e,1579916265.0,What country are you in? It starts at 40cp for me
CallOfDutyMobile,ffgv41v,t1_ffgs7aj,1579915830.0,115$ for a gun is a scam. Posts like this are free ads for these shitty practices. All of these posts are r/hailcorporate material. That’s why they get downvoted.
CallOfDutyMobile,ffguvc0,t1_ffgq56y,1579915656.0,Yet you still fall for it...
CallOfDutyMobile,ffgujua,t1_ffgpnnc,1579915424.0,Okay this is getting ridiculous now ximena. I’ve seen you copy and paste the same post about the shit matchmaking in over 50 posts now.
CallOfDutyMobile,ffgkl45,t3_etiav2,1579908381.0,Does it seriously increase every time you buy crates? I know the lucky draws doubles in price each spin but didn’t know crates did too
CallOfDutyMobile,ffgked0,t1_ffed89l,1579908257.0,Maybe on the 7th spin you spent that much but not cumulatively.
CallOfDutyMobile,fffrm7h,t1_fffr0ks,1579890290.0,Shoot I’m at elite 4 and there are some sweaty players in solo. Campers until the final circle then use the drone at the last second to kill me multiple times now. I had 15 kills by thr time it was just two players and killed the final 4 people only to be killed by the camper in the final circle.
CallOfDutyMobile,fff0z0v,t1_fff0guh,1579872672.0,You do know this post provides free pr
CallOfDutyMobile,ffee1v9,t1_ffed2rn,1579844564.0,Fuck sakes that’s high
CallOfDutyMobile,ffecw5l,t3_et58r7,1579843451.0,Not surprised at this point. They won’t ever change. What is the total cost to get buy all ten spins? I can’t do it right now but they won’t pass up that money for all the suckers who buy all the items every time.
WTF,ffeacbw,t1_ffe02pe,1579841136.0,Sometimes there shit on the outside of the torlet
kakarot,ffdv7l5,t3_et2z8h,1579829751.0,How do you get this?
gtaonline,ffdu9qv,t3_esuouf,1579829082.0,I was in a casino heist with randoms and one guy just couldn’t do the finger print hack. I got bored and started doing random emotes. I ended going through all my pisswasser and cigarettes and it alerted the guards I felt bad but it shouldn’t take 10 minutes to do that hack part of the mission
gtaonline,ffclumh,t1_ffbwdus,1579802207.0,That’s not the one where one person goes at a time right? I hated that mode. I love the mosh pit version where everyone goes at once.
kakarot,ffb5k0n,t3_esn8rf,1579752372.0,"System? I kept having an issue with bo4 where every update required me to have twice the amount of space needed. Until I got an external harddrive, I had this issue. But if you have 2tbs free that probably isn’t your issue. If your on PS4 you can try rebuilding your database"
CallOfDutyMobile,ffazvvx,t1_ffayyw9,1579748361.0,Along with that why does the impact  zone stay on the mini map for seconds after it hits the target.
CallOfDutyMobile,ffazqm6,t1_ffazl8x,1579748261.0,I use basic still. Way easier with two thumbs on an iPhone for me. Sometime I’ll zoom first but not most of the time
CallOfDutyMobile,ffazlb8,t1_ffayg0r,1579748161.0,I don’t even know the total time for this mode but it’s got to be 20 minutes at least.
CallOfDutyMobile,ffapofx,t1_ffafven,1579741565.0,Why do you keep spamming this everywhere?
CallOfDutyMobile,ffap7lh,t1_ffalavf,1579741250.0,A very very small chance but yeah
CallOfDutyMobile,ffap3i5,t1_ffanner,1579741173.0,I wouldn’t even click the link let alone type it in myself
CallOfDutyMobile,ffadxbl,t3_esjcxu,1579733309.0,Sniping in any game is very satisfying. Battlefield games especially because those have bullet drops and are difficult to hit.
CallOfDutyMobile,ffaduga,t3_esjidr,1579733246.0,I’ve never seen the timer run out before you hit the max 150 kill limit
CallOfDutyMobile,ff9mj6z,t3_esf9ua,1579716118.0,Way to flex on the character skin
kakarot,ff9mddi,t1_ff9hmuf,1579716022.0,Yeah I guess you’re right. The game already stutters for me if I fly at full speed right when I load into an area. I just hate how you have to go through 7 minute long loading screens to collect the dbs and all the loading during the story.
CallOfDutyMobile,ff9d4r6,t1_ff97t3g,1579710366.0,Respectable. I haven’t had time to play that much yet plus I’ve been playing that new dragon ball z game
CallOfDutyMobile,ff9d4g4,t1_ff97t3g,1579710360.0,Respectable. I haven’t had time to play that much yet plus I’ve been playing that new dragon ball z game
kakarot,ff96bk0,t1_ff8xaio,1579705873.0,How would the loading screens be longer?
NSFW_GIF,ff8cc7y,t1_ff8avcv,1579672734.0,Where the areolas are the same skin tone of the boob.
Unexpected,ff831u5,t1_ff782zq,1579664670.0,Why would you actually hold it there? Move it it and gtfo
kakarot,ff7unue,t3_es3tw9,1579658778.0,All of the loading screens are the biggest drawback from the game for me. Collecting all the dragons balls takes 7 loading screens. This game should’ve been a full open world. It would make it way more enjoyable to play and explore. Also how you have to hit a button to progress the dialogue most of the time is very annoying as well.
kakarot,ff7ub6q,t1_ff7okho,1579658541.0,Oh that’s how you get them? I thought you might be able to make the dishes randomly and unlock them if you have all the ingredients
CallOfDutyMobile,ff7s7im,t3_es468o,1579657081.0,I’ll play that much this season regardless but the reward for the amount of time could be better
CallOfDutyMobile,ff7ehh8,t3_es236u,1579647682.0,Um what
CallOfDutyMobile,ff7eg24,t1_ff7dgq0,1579647657.0,Me either. It’s not just you
CallOfDutyMobile,ff7aq6r,t1_ff7a757,1579644848.0,Yeah I don’t get it. I say gather around when we are in the pregame lobby then before we jump. Put a marker down when in the air. They always drop in very hot zones which you’re guaranteed to get killed very quick if you drop alone or aren’t well coordinated. At the beginning of season 2 people stuck together for the most part but it’s the opposite now.
kakarot,ff7a5qa,t3_es1dw2,1579644374.0,I had no problems completing it without even trying. You shouldn’t have a problem
kakarot,ff7a14h,t1_ff789sr,1579644268.0,I prefer to lose ki over health Everytime.
CallOfDutyMobile,ff79to5,t1_ff6mmiu,1579644103.0,"They are the worst. Before when I was grinding rank in quads, I would gain points in a couple then lose points the next game. After switching to solo, 9/10 games I would gain 30-40 points per game. My average kill rate went up by a full point for the rest of the season and won way more games."
kakarot,ff6m3ft,t1_ff6lsz8,1579630111.0,It’s so annoying gathering them since they are spread across 7 areas. That’s 7 loading screens..
CallOfDutyMobile,ff6luog,t1_ff5c1bn,1579629963.0,That’d be some shit
CallOfDutyMobile,ff6lq7c,t1_ff6llfh,1579629887.0,Play solo when you start on br. Overall you’ll get more points Than random squads.
CallOfDutyMobile,ff6lfej,t1_ff6fr0x,1579629702.0,If you don’t play non stop. Probably. I’d focus on br so you can get that skin
CallOfDutyMobile,ff6l4oj,t1_ff6hqaa,1579629522.0,You can only buy 4 per day though
CallOfDutyMobile,ff6kwin,t3_erx3qf,1579629387.0,"In mp even though I don’t play much I like the bk57 (I think that’s what it’s called) because I unlocked the Mardi Gras camo and it looks tight to me. 

In br I got with the ak117 and ak47 combo or switch one out for the artic 50 exotic if I find one. Used to use the smrs but after the nerf it’s not as reliable."
CallOfDutyMobile,ff6kiyv,t3_erx6a9,1579629158.0,Happens a lot as it because most people don’t understand the concept of squads and drops separately from everyone else and quits when they die immediately
CallOfDutyMobile,ff55l21,t3_ero6ok,1579580869.0,Same in br. It seems like they last a lot shorter too now. It sucks. They are very tactical in br.
CallOfDutyMobile,ff55hy5,t3_erobc8,1579580800.0,I got it last season with like two weeks to spare starting from scratch
CallOfDutyMobile,ff558yo,t1_ff54oqv,1579580598.0,Imagine how shitty it’d be if you could only get it once per season
CallOfDutyMobile,ff555z6,t1_ff54sr1,1579580533.0,I assume it’s four per day.
CallOfDutyMobile,ff4vvc1,t1_ff4qglf,1579573688.0,Frontline isn’t objective based
dogswithjobs,ff4idv1,t1_ff4cbec,1579564344.0,Same
CallOfDutyMobile,ff49tfd,t1_ff46ejt,1579558670.0,That’s why I like older battlefields  the realism was pretty good. Still had respawns but it simulated war battles pretty well
dyinglight,ff49o0o,t1_ff3w98u,1579558578.0,Wish they had it on PS4. I’ll need to see if my pc can handle it
dogswithjobs,ff45wrw,t1_ff45iln,1579556241.0,Doesn’t take away from the fact that this is astroturfing
dogswithjobs,ff44pyv,t1_ff3xhyg,1579555491.0,It’s totally an ad. Look at the description in their profile. Flyaway geese is their company. They mentioned both their company and the harness which I’m sure they’re affiliated with as well.
CallOfDutyMobile,ff44iih,t1_ff43g50,1579555361.0,They didn’t use to have them. The realism is what initially made cod so popular. Score streaks are enough.
CallOfDutyMobile,ff42tbd,t3_erj8vf,1579554311.0,Yeah they need a barebones playlist
dogswithjobs,ff4244z,t1_ff3qgc7,1579553879.0,Yeah. These posts are getting way to prevelant
dogswithjobs,ff42201,t1_ff3s8kc,1579553842.0,Yep.
dogswithjobs,ff41uzf,t1_ff3wd3z,1579553722.0,Definitely an ad
dogswithjobs,ff41t86,t1_ff3t1u1,1579553692.0,You got a problem with Canadian gooses you got a problem with me and I suggest you let that one marinate
dogswithjobs,ff41pp9,t1_ff3srtz,1579553629.0,Definitely just an ad.
instant_regret,ff3zuak,t1_ff3n48t,1579552465.0,Still not always 100% that you won’t get shocked. When I was a kid I liked taking apart electronics. I took apart a camera once with the batteries out. Didn’t know about capacitors at the time and shocked the shit out of my self.
dyinglight,ff3w5yz,t1_ff3a7he,1579550167.0,Accurate
dyinglight,ff3w43n,t1_ff3rypm,1579550135.0,It’s been a weird couple years. A bunch of my favorite shows have been delayed and now many of my favorite games are being delayed. I feel empty and bored. No entertainment to keep me from getting bored.
dyinglight,ff3vo6t,t3_erf31f,1579549860.0,Fuck. :(. I really need a new game to play that captivated me as much as dying light. I got excited because I saw an ad to buy dying light 2 and thought it came out only to hear that it’s delayed after I looked it up
kakarot,ff3sh8g,t1_ff1ed8f,1579547881.0,There are a lot of games I’m looking forward to this year
memes,ff3aqcg,t1_ff38xm8,1579537538.0,Wendys must be pretty fancy with their pick 4 for 5 deal
kakarot,ff25taw,t1_ff254cq,1579494620.0,Yeah they are annoying. I got triple kamehemaha’d by those things.
CallOfDutyMobile,ff1yb1v,t1_ff1y5vn,1579488974.0,Like those out of bounds glitches in bo4
CallOfDutyMobile,ff1rlvu,t3_er5ysm,1579484635.0,Looks like they want to lower the earn rate of tiers and crates so you’re more likely to buy. At least the pass was cheaper. Not half off like it should’ve been
CallOfDutyMobile,ff1pklu,t1_ff1ln9u,1579483332.0,That’s what most youtubers who do giveaways do. Host a giveaway. Create a fake account and announce the winner but you’re awarding it to yourself.
CallOfDutyMobile,ff1ouwr,t1_ff1ml0f,1579482886.0,That’s the only reason I picked it up at the end of season two. I’m not planning to buy any crates or anything so I should always have the pass for the 10$
CallOfDutyMobile,ff1lokz,t1_ff0s6hr,1579481222.0,Fuck
CallOfDutyMobile,ff1b084,t1_ff11jqq,1579476970.0,I bought it at 96 a few days ago and did most of them
kakarot,ff12t80,t3_er0xca,1579474681.0,The dialogue options. Sometimes it runs automatically sometimes you have to mash the button just to progress the dialogue. It’s annoying. Cutscenes should run automatically. I don’t want to have to hold the control in my hand through 20 minute dialogues and load screens.
kakarot,ff127p0,t3_er0z4q,1579474482.0,Are using a lot of healing items? Don’t use them except between battles or when the game automatically gives you full health. I try to use as few healing items as possible.
kakarot,ff0ip19,t3_er1yb6,1579469206.0,That one was annoying. Took about 3 restarts before I got him. One time he did three back to back drains. You can dodge it if you time it right but idk what indicates he’s about to do the move
kakarot,ff0i2uf,t3_eqppv6,1579469087.0,I hit 120 combo in the fight against android 20 and I thought that was impressive. This is ridiculous though
CallOfDutyMobile,ff0ece7,t1_ff01kif,1579468077.0,Well done will you join our clan?
kakarot,fezqlar,t1_feywhwc,1579460404.0,I’ve found that if you attack repeatedly then before it the attack that knocks them back afterimage and the combo will continue. Rinse and repeat until they get red and do the energy knock back or ki blast then dodge
kakarot,fezi21s,t1_fezg1v0,1579457589.0,I think it’s funny that some of the review videos I watched before buying the game said it was too easy. There are some parts that are but some battles are pretty difficult especially if you try not to use any healing items
kakarot,fez6bib,t3_eqwk6v,1579454237.0,"If the enemy is glowing red not from the ki power up, back up. If you’re within range when the enemy attacks you’ll be stunned and vulnerable to other attacks"
kakarot,fez618v,t3_eqvay5,1579454140.0,Oh shit thanks. I’ve been trying to hunt those things down for a while since some of the skills are locked behind them and the training grounds
kakarot,fez4v1s,t1_feynr35,1579453878.0,Same I haven’t used the cooking mechanic once yet and I’m at the android saga now
kakarot,fez4adc,t1_feyf8nr,1579453696.0,That’s cannon to the story too so that’s pretty cool
kakarot,fez3p4b,t1_feynkgv,1579453586.0,I’m training for the android saga now. I ran through the saiyan and frieza saga Friday and Saturday. I’m off tomorrow too but I have to do some adulting. Won’t make progress the rest of the week
kakarot,fewjcdp,t1_fewhlgw,1579411771.0,Oh. Read it wrong
kakarot,fewgkvo,t1_fev5gju,1579410229.0,Yeah at least in battles. I fought frieza and his dad as trunks. Not much further than that though but I’m sure you can
kakarot,fewa0ke,t1_few6xmv,1579407370.0,Frieza saga does last a while but not too long. The android and buu sagas are going to be really long I’m sure
