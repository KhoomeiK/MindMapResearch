I run 2 in my house and I've configured a few hundred in customer environments and no real issues except firmware once but even the newest releases have been stable at my home and I install them pretty much same day to test.

All in all a good solution.  The only gripe I have is that bridging an SSID to an existing local LAN is a bit strange versus having a network dedicated to the SSID.  IMO they are pretty hard to beat on price and performance unless you go Ubiquiti and I would stay away from those in an environment that can't tolerate minor outages or lack of support."

From a purely numbers perspective that is a lot more dead kids from drain cleaner and the like

This all boils down to parental responsibility.  You are blaming something that is not the cause of the issue and removing guns won't fix the problem.  There are around 400 million guns in the US and 78 child deaths resulted from those in 2018.  Again from a purely numbers perspective, that is very few irresponsible gun owners who tragically lost their children due to negligence.

OneY,fes5rmx,t1_fdon2r4,1579361714.0,"For me, I had weak social skills and was really confused about who I was and what I wanted out of life.  So many things needed figuring out that I had to just stop worrying about being with someone and figure out how to love with myself.  I needed to figure out what I wanted from life and develop more socially.  Once I stopped obsessing over how I was perceived by others, especially women, I started reaffirming my identity to myself and the confidence I gained from really starting to be me instead of more of a social chameleon made me more comfortable in my own skin.

I basically took from 18 to 25 and focused on having fun, being with my friends and making new friends, and figuring out some semblance of an idea of what I wanted to do with my life.  Even though emotional and physical companionship was important I put it on the back burner and focused more on myself and magically that confidence in being my started attracting more attention.  Female acquaintances from my social group started becoming friends and casually we would form a closer relationship and eventually it would evolve into something fun and comfortable.  I was very clear with myself that I wouldn't just be an adoring bystander anymore and I was very clear that I was not necessarily interested in having a long term relationship because I was trying to figure my shit out and that never seemed to matter.  Eventually my wife and I found each other and she somehow flipped the script on my and I found myself wanting to be with her forever...12 years together now and I couldn't imagine it any other way.

What I learned is, if you can't be comfortable being yourself then being with someone else is 5x harder because you rely on them for your identity.  I know it is hard and there were definitely depressing times when I acknowledged I just needed to stop worrying about finding someone to be with but slowly I figured out like 65% of who I was and I stopped accepting the role of social outcast that I had ultimately foisted upon my own shoulders.  Most people are pretty nice if you talk to them so I learned how to talk to people about things they were interested in while still being a semi-weird dude interested in science and computers and the stars.  It made me well rounded, confident (but not a dick), and without figuring out how to be those things how are you supposed to be happy with yourself much less make someone else happy.  It doesn't happen overnight but it can and does happen so work on making it happen and figuring out who you are in this crazy ass world."

Just because you fear guns and/or don't like them doesn't mean you can force people to sacrifice their constitutional rights. Sorry.  The simple fact is that most gun violence and death is perpetrated by guns that are obtained illegally.
