politics,fffpt25,t3_eta04x,1579889172.0,">Trump has also been ""rewarding senators who have his back on impeachment"" by helping them raise campaign cash, ""and sending a message to those who don't to get on board,"" Politico reported in October. And Trump, U.S. Chamber of Commerce strategist Scott Reed noted, ""has the ability to turn on the money spigot like no one else.""    

Everyone in a Red State needs to think very hard about who they vote for in the coming years. The entire Senate GOP is culpable in destroying our democracy. 

It's not enough that Trump be impeached or removed or not reelected. Your Republican senators have zero reason to care about these hearings while the president encourages them to turn a blind eye.  

You may be the reddest dire hard conservative who doesn't care about anything but your own family, property, and well being. Unfortunately, it is your civic duty as a citizen of these UNITED States to consider the welfare of your neighbors and our Republic. 

We all have some hard choices to make - Democrats too. I would encourage voters to elect candidates who have strong principles, who work for the people, and aren't bullied by political pressure or weakened by corporate donations. Even if you don't agree with all their policies or values."

>Instead, over the last two years, we have seen influential leaders denigrate and discard the most effective methods for addressing complex threats—international agreements with strong verification regimes—in favor of their own narrow interests and domestic political gain. By undermining cooperative, science- and law-based approaches to managing the most urgent threats to humanity, these leaders have helped to create a situation that will, if unaddressed, lead to catastrophe, sooner rather than later.

Does anyone think $14 for a whole animal is expensive? Forgot how much it *can* cost you. Consider if this is a reasonable price. Their description is below. Would you rather eat this sort of product over the cheaper stuff or does it not matter to you?  

>	Green Circle™ chicken is available exclusively at D’Artagnan. This free-range chicken is certified humane by Humane Farm Animal Care, raised without antibiotics or hormones, and fed actual vegetables collected from commercial kitchens and farmers markets, along with grains. The diet and the care that is taken on the farm – plus the air-chilling - give these birds a unique, old-fashioned, real chicken flavor."

Music,ff5cu4y,t1_ff4y69n,1579587617.0,"I grew up with records. I don’t know what you mean about them sucking. The main reason we moved on was the convenience - especially to play music in the car.

Music,ff5c61n,t1_ff520k6,1579586905.0,"I still have a handful of cds. Some are from friends’ bands and some are sacds. You’ve got some valid points that I wouldn’t argue with. I’m with ya on Plex too. I have about 5000 high bit rate tracks. Here’s a few reasons I like records. 

Records seem to retain their value longer.  
Albums can be found pressed around the world and mastered differently making the experience of discovering differently produced records exciting.  
I honestly don’t think I know anyone with a CD player or DVD player other than my mother. I know at least a dozen people with turntables.  
I go to a weekly bring your own vinyl night. Bring your own cds isn’t really fun.  
Gifting someone a record is also much cooler than gifting them a cd. Especially when you can give your nephew his grandfather’s records. 

We all get to enjoy music however we like. I’m just glad more records are being made for those of us who lean less utilitarian."

Music,ff4nokw,t1_ff4jwcr,1579568036.0,"The end of year 2019 sales figures haven’t come out yet. There was a mid-year [report](http://www.riaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mid-Year-2019-RIAA-Music-Revenues-Report.pdf)in September which some publications used to claim vinyl is *on target* to outsell cd for the first time since 1986.  

You’re right that actual numbers do not exist and it would be more accurate to say *revenue* was neck and neck as of the most recent numbers. 

Year over year, cd sales are the same while vinyl increased 6%. In [2018](https://www.riaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/RIAA-Mid-Year-2018-Revenue-Report-News-Notes.pdf), cd sales had dropped 50% while vinyl went up 13%.  

And I agree, it really doesn’t matter at all. But, as someone who appreciates owning physical media, its cool to see that some artists are seeing such a strong demand for records that they aren’t even releasing cds any more. 

It’s really weird to see so many cd lovers here."
