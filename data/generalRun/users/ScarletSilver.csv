OP's version is just a bit more... non-techie friendly. if anything. Something less tech-inclined people can better use."

relationships,ffi0dgj,t3_etl7ge,1579961203.0,"Most likely, it's just hurt pride. At least that's what I'm thinking (as a guy).

If I called my SO about it, even when drunk, it means I want to confide in her and not hide anything from her, especially this. Definitely hurts your pride to know that you've been replaced so quickly, perhaps even way before that if the ex was already mulling about who to move on with.

But then again, this is something that can be easily misconstrued as still having feelings for the ex (it can even be misunderstood as still loving the ex, if you are not careful with it and given his drunken state, he most likely has not been careful about his words).

Bottom line, OP needs to chill first and talk with BF once he's sober."
