If you're saying there's no democracy at work over there, then just what were Iowans doing yesterday?

If nothing else, you can wait until the semester is over and let the dean of that college know, or whoever it is. That way grades are in, and if you're not in the school that professor works for you won't see them again anyway. Toss grenade in room, exit room. Assuming you weren't being an ass, the professor was way out of line, and they ought to be corrected. Even if you don't really care that much about this assignment.

quick edit: If you do want to report, emails or other written statements about the topic would be best, as the people taking the report would want some sort of evidence that it happened at all.

If they put effort into it, it's pretty decent except for the interplay between private businesses and that insurance. Honestly I prefer it over private, because private has always been terrible for my family, not having too much money growing up. 

When I was little I was on low-income health insurance, which was pretty good. I would have less teeth if I didn't have that, for sure, because as young kid I was an idiot, but an idiot with the only set of teeth I'd ever get and bad dental habits. The only difficulty was that only some dentists would take that insurance, which is an issue that disappears under a single-payer system. 

Then I was on private insurance or uninsured, as I think we no longer qualified for whatever reason. Not because we had too much money though, that's for sure. The private insurance was not great, and we had to take out payment plans for medical care. 

Later I was in the military, where the quality was also fine in some areas but great in others. Going to the doctor was ""make an appointment and it'll be 3 weeks,"" and as far as I could tell the only option for ""I'm not planning on being sick then, I'm sick *now*"" was ""then go to urgent care."" Which I guess is reasonable looking back, and it was 24/7 and free, but being attached to the hospital I felt like I shouldn't go unless I was in real trouble. More on my ignorance I guess. Dental care on the other hand was great. Best dental work I've ever had, hands down. I miss the fuck out of that. 

I'm on VA now, which is good. Doctor visits are what you'd expect, and they recently made it such that I can go to an urgent care that accepts VA insurance if I need to. No referral, no bills. I did that recently when I got the flu, and the worst part of the ordeal was having a high fever an light sensitivity, but having to search for places online and call to ask them about insurance. I also had to make an ER trip on a separate occasion, which was fine. Long visit because I hit peak hours and was not in danger, but it was free. For that one I got to call a nurse line who gave me medical advice, which helped get me over the mental block of going at all, since I'm not inclined to make a trip to the ER.

I'm not overestimating the risk of disaster, just wanting a justification for taking on the risk. I know that the risk is low, but the damage can be severe, and therefore the risk ought to be examined and justified. I can't keep a large bomb in my house, even if it's pretty safe. The risk of a bomb exploding as it sits in my closet is probably close to zero, but having the explosives present is still a risk for various reasons, and there's no justification to take on that risk so I can't keep a bomb in my closet. ""It's really, *really* unlikely that it'll explode"" is not a justification, just a statement about probability. It amounts to dismissing the risk rather than justifying it, if there's nothing to add about why the benefit outweighs the risk. The lower the risk, the easier it is to have a benefit that outweighs it, but if there's no unique benefit then I don't see why the risk is justified at all. 

I'm not an alarmist when it comes to nuclear, and I can't stress that enough. I know that there are people who think every nuclear plant is an accident waiting to happen, but I'm not one of those people. I just expect risks to be evaluated, justified, and accepted or rejected based on risk/reward. For power generation, I expect that the risk/reward come out ahead of other methods, as otherwise the other methods are what we should choose. 

As for return on investment, the other methods *do* provide return on investment, and energy storage is a field we have experience with. Many fields, from power generation to computer science, use the concept of buffers. It's common to have an unsteady input but need a steady output, or vice versa. Water demand is not regular, but you can use a regular stream of input to meet that demand if you plan ahead and say, use a water tower. In my opinion we're roughly at the stage, given the effects of the ""duck curve,"" where we need to be getting good buffers planned. Not a new problem though, just not as heavily applied to power generation as it is in certain other things."

The short of it is that the military is not a ""pull from the poor"" organization, and the lowest 20% of the population by income, as measured by a proxy, are actually slightly underrepresented in recruits. The top 20% are also underrepresented, a bit more (meaning less recruits from that quintile) than the lowest quintile.

It's a long-term obligation with no safe permanent disposal option short of literally waiting it out, that we're passing off to all future generations. Since the waste lasts so long and we use so much energy, the equilibrium where the rate of new waste created is equal to old waste becoming safely inert is also a concern. I don't know where that level is, or whether it's sustainable, and I haven't really run across any info on that while researching the issue. The long term nature of the waste also means that even the stability of the nations that house the waste is an issue, because we're depending on a nation's population to properly handle it for such an insanely long time period.

Not a huge chance, no. But the consequences can be severe, and any facility with the potential to fail in this manner is something we have to justify.

Why should we invest in these expensive plants that have a small risk of failure and produce waste that must be stored indefinitely, rather than using these other methods?
