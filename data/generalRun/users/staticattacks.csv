todayilearned,fgivjpk,t1_fgikddl,1580831834.0,"I preferred Scorpion Down to Blind Man's Bluff. I'm at work, it's not available to pull excerpts from online, and my books are packed up at home.

Scorpion Down details the messages, events, and even the exact maneuvers preformed by the Scorpion in the days and hours leading up to the sinking. They were not transiting the Atlantic returning home, they were shadowing a Russian group preforming exercises somewhere around the Azores (edit: Canary Islands), I don't remember exactly off the top of my head. There was a Russian sub as part of that group and eventually the Scorpion was had. Sosus net picked up the entire dogfight. The recording indicates much more maneuvering and for a longer time period than would be expected for a hot running torpedo, which is what Blind Man's Bluff indicates was the Captain's response, whether it was the actual condition or not.

The reason why I can so easily accept this version is the fact that there are many individuals that, by piecing their own isolated stories together, corroborate the vast majority of these events, to include sonar operators who were played the original sosus recordings, government officials, and even a Soviet submarine Captain who claims to have been the one that sunk her. I doubt this will ever be acknowledged because it would be a black eye against the US Navy and the government, for having lost a boat to the Russians and for then covering it up and lying to the families for decades.

Even to this day, when Trump declassified and released tons of documents from the 60s, documents about the Scorpion notably remained heavily redacted.

Edit: To reiterate my previous point, not argue whether it was a hot running torpedo or not, as you mentioned in your excerpts, whether it was a hot runner or the foil strip failed and caused the *battery* to overheat and ignite the warhead, the Captain likely would have performed the same maneuver, which the Sosus recordings just didn't support."
todayilearned,fgihl3a,t1_fghws3t,1580821865.0,"The torpedoes didn't just detonate without warning, the engine fired up and ran until it was exhausted, *then* it exploded. I don't recall exactly, but I think analysis of the boat's maneuvers before the explosion don't correlate well to the maneuvers laid out in the procedure to disarm a hot running torpedo. They would have had to do a full 180 degree maneuver to disarm the weapon, as it would think it was in the water and had accidentally turned to face it's own boat."

todayilearned,fghurdy,t1_fgh8jxc,1580794461.0,"The cause of the sinking of the Scorpion is... Questionable to say the least. Long story short, there's a theory (that I personally believe) that the Scorpion was in a fight and sunk by a Russian sub. The wreckage could confirm or deny that. Also, as mentioned, you never want people to know what your best tech is.

Also the Thresher and Scorpion were both lost in the 1960s, so it'd been roughly 20 years they were down there."
