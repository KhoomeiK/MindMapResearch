CollegeBasketball,ffe97t8,t1_ffe6rji,1579840179.0,Ohio State is doing their best to replicate IU's last season.
qotsa,fervir6,t3_eqgkhy,1579358771.0,Not surprised. He loved that album when it came out.
Coffee,feeg1lz,t1_feed4yp,1579033012.0,"Indy repping here too. I like Tinker quite a bit and I think they'll grind them for you if you buy at the store (downtown). 

I'm a member of their subscription service that sends you two bags a month of two different roasts, so when you do eventually get a grinder I'd recommend that for convenience. 

I also ordered the Fellow Ode grinder which I should be getting around mid this year so if you want to buy my Baratza Encore off me I'll give you a good deal."
Coffee,fe9dtnv,t1_fe86k3f,1578936662.0,Same here. When it's too hot it tastes super bitter to me but as it cools down a bit it gets much smoother.

explainlikeimfive,fdm8rtq,t3_eluost,1578542626.0,Muscle burns a lot of calories even when you're not moving. Keep this in mind when trying to lose weight. It's not all about cardio.
aww,fdjq2ka,t1_fdjps4j,1578483014.0,"Ha I wish he was that discerning. He just keeps going until I get it right.

We have two rescues as well. The husky who's ~9 and a GSD that's 2.5."
aww,fdjpaij,t1_fdjkv3x,1578481990.0,Haha I think I read a comment on here at some point that huskies have dog hardware with cat software so maybe it saw itself in the sled dogs.
aww,fdjp79o,t1_fdjmzoc,1578481869.0,"We adopted him a few years ago and my gf was very bummed when he didn't howl because she thought it was cute. He has done it a few times when he's really excited like when we've come back from being out of town for a week. 

His barks are almost always singular and very high pitched. He'll stare me down first and there will be ~10 seconds of build up then a loud yelp. It still causes me to jump when he does it."
aww,fdj5zvk,t1_fdj5m1e,1578459404.0,My fiancée is the heavy sleeper while I'm light. He only does this to me. It's not frequent that he wakes me though.
aww,fdj5229,t1_fdj10ob,1578458652.0,"I have a husky (not quite the same, I know) but he loves barking at me for food, water, or to go out. He is more polite while I'm sleeping and will just put his cold nose on me if he needs something."
