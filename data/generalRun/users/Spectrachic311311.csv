EDAnonymous,ffqhdq2,t1_ffqcbbc,1580134644.0,I do too! Our company makes a collagen powder you can mix with beverages. Ours is made with chicken combs and it works very well. I would also add that you should look for a strontium supplement for bone health. It also prevents osteoporosis and it also strengthens nails.
childfree,ffqh3sn,t3_eujpgo,1580134417.0,My nephew got blacklisted from every daycare in the area where my sister lives because he would throw chairs at the teachers. He was 5. Now he’s 12 and he does the most evil shit to his sisters. My sister keeps thinking he will grow out of it but my God...I don’t want to think about what he might do as an adult.
EDAnonymous,ffpdruy,t3_eugl99,1580092519.0,"Me! I don’t get hungry until I’m ravenous and then I pig out and eat a ton of veggies and look pregnant. I am in awe of people who wake up and eat actual breakfast, lunch and dinner."
EDAnonymous,ffpdaci,t3_eu7ny3,1580092171.0,I struggle with this SO HARD. I barely let my husband touch me. I’m convinced he only has sex with me because I’m a convenient vagina and not because he finds me attractive. But he tells me daily that he thinks I’m attractive and I just don’t get it because I feel so gross.
EDAnonymous,ffpb2zz,t1_ffkh2ac,1580090624.0,"Ha I know right?? I saw him doing that and I’m like oh God, that’s me! I was looking at cat foods and trying to figure out the highest calorie ones to get him and it was like...uh, I really should be doing the exact same thing for myself."
EDAnonymous,ffk0kan,t3_eu00ai,1580012127.0,"You are really small—I’m like 20 lbs more at your height and I have a lot of people say I look too thin. Of course ED lies and says we are too big, but that simply isn’t true."
EDAnonymous,ffjxnbz,t3_etw7e0,1580009778.0,Once I saw this super thin lady at the thrift store and I was so jealous until she walked to the food pantry to get some stuff. I realized she was probably not that way by choice and I felt like such an asshole.
fatlogic,ffjkj8e,t3_etr1xy,1580000325.0,"Calories are like a price tag. I would not buy anything without knowing the price, right? If a food is the calorie equivalent of a Louis Vuitton bag, I would make sure I had the budget for it."
EDAnonymous,ffjfxek,t3_etvs3v,1579997411.0,"I had a roommate who was anorexic and I legit was pretty naive and just wanted to be thin like her so I started eating (well, not eating) like her. And I lost weight fast and then discovered weight loss communities and proana groups. At that point I think I thought I would just stop before I got overly thin. Little did I know..."
EDAnonymous,ffj5hdn,t3_etq99f,1579990897.0,Happy Birthday!!! I hope you enjoyed that cake. You definitely deserve it!!
EDAnonymous,ffh9ad5,t1_ffh5fk0,1579926825.0,Well... B12 just helps you convert carbs to energy. It doesn’t help much if you don’t eat enough calories.
EDAnonymous,ffh96f5,t3_etjro6,1579926729.0,I traded bulimia for anorexia at some point in time because I felt like that was recovery from bulimia. The weird stuff ED tells us.
dogs,ffgdbkv,t3_etd5f7,1579903704.0,When I lived in the city my Rottweiler got attacked by a boxer who ran off someone’s porch and wasn’t leashed. Lucky for her he just grabbed her neck and she wriggled out of it but it had lasting scars on her temperament.
EDAnonymous,fffp9i8,t3_et9u68,1579888833.0,"I can relate. My parents only really ever praised me when I did well in school or played my clarinet well. When I went to college and no longer got great grades, they stopped praising me and became ccritical of me. I thought losing weight would make them care again but it didn’t work. My mom is now dead and I don’t know what is holding me back from recovery now...I’ve always been self sufficient and stoic, so maybe it’s wanting to be disabled and unable to work. Or something. I’m just really messed up I think."
EDAnonymous,fffeqdq,t3_et9tgg,1579882352.0,"I once had a cashier ask me if I had a pet rabbit because of all the veggies I bought. I said “Nope, no rabbit. I’m the rabbit. These are the only foods that feel safe to me”. I walked out and I was so embarrassed. Why do they need to comment?"
EDAnonymous,fffbkw7,t3_et90oq,1579880357.0,"Ice cream, cake, chocolate, pasta, cheese, and booze."
EDAnonymous,fffb7ek,t3_et2kh8,1579880116.0,That IS a bit fucked up. I admit I like baking for my husband because he likes things made the original way with non diet ingredients. But I don’t increase the calories at all on purpose.
fuckeatingdisorders,fff8ls8,t3_et8pcn,1579878423.0,I stopped believing in hardcore calories when I got my environmental engineering degree and learned about how most wastewater treatment plants can almost run themselves on the energy they generate burning poop. Poop has still about half the thermal energy food does. FYI. You’re welcome for that fun little fact.
fuckeatingdisorders,ffe8td2,t3_esw5fs,1579839847.0,"I could crush that 10,000 calories challenge because I have the stomach of a beast. I don’t even want to know how many calories I could technically eat."
nutrition,ffb6bbq,t3_esnfyz,1579752953.0,"Miralax is just an osmotic that draws water into your system so your best bet to better poop is lots of fiber (psyllium or oats, prunes, veggies, chia seeds are all great) and drink a LOT of water."

EatingIntuitively,ffb61w2,t3_eshoe9,1579752753.0,Everyone in my office is on keto. ðŸ™„
My600lbLife,ffa4q33,t3_esgz2n,1579727843.0,"I read an interesting article about how spending and eating habits are related. Like if you can think through why you wouldnâ€™t blow all your money at once, you can also understand why you would not just eat everything because you can. Plus there are the ones like Sean who blow enormous amounts of money on food."
fuckeatingdisorders,ff994br,t3_es5mav,1579707686.0,"Are you me?? Wow, so many parallels to my struggles. Iâ€™m 38 and an engineer, work FT and spend all of my free time compulsive exercising and I restrict and eat all my calories within a 3 hour window. Iâ€™m not underweight and I feel like such a phony but at the same time I absolutely hate my life. I have ruined my intestines with lax abuse and I will never shit normally again. I want help but I feel so hopeless, like Iâ€™m just broken. Iâ€™ve had these patterns so long that I honestly donâ€™t know how to fix them."
EDAnonymous,ff6cw8g,t3_erunje,1579624448.0,Iâ€™m 38 and never got pregnant because I didnâ€™t think I was capable of not affecting my child with ED problems. I am also terrified of losing control of my body and I think Iâ€™m just better off having pets.
My600lbLife,ff63fq9,t3_ern2a6,1579618165.0,I feel like a jerk when I watch the show and think â€œwhat stress do they have? I have a job and family; they literally just eat and sleep all dayâ€. Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s more to it but really? Stress?
fuckeatingdisorders,ff534hf,t3_ermrmg,1579578928.0,Raw carrots are okay but cooked ones arenâ€™t. Canned soup is fine if itâ€™s less than 80 calories a serving but not fine if itâ€™s 90.
EDAnonymous,ff52yrx,t3_ermdfg,1579578803.0,"When I got diagnosed as AN, my mom told me about her BED and how she felt like a failed bulimic. She was the only person in my life who ever really â€œgotâ€ what I was going through."
nutrition,ff315e9,t3_erblx3,1579530906.0,"That if you eat low carb/keto, you will lose weight even if you eat too many calories. It doesnâ€™t work that way."
EDAnonymous,ff1t51n,t3_eqwsm4,1579485598.0,My grandma said they used to do this with sweetened condensed milk. My bet is that that tastes WAY better than almond milk. Lol.
EDAnonymous,ff1szhe,t3_eqx3ko,1579485501.0,Yep. I get so hungry after getting to my LW that I pig out and gain an instant 5lbs.
nutrition,ff1sr88,t3_er4vwu,1579485356.0,The magic of fiber. I can eat a lot more calories if it contains a lot of fiber and not gain weight. Iâ€™m almost wondering if the roughage helps us to not absorb more of the calories.
fatlogic,ff16f2b,t3_eqvvrb,1579475661.0,I buy thisâ€” I definitely underestimated my calories when I was fat. I would eat like 4000 calories a day but assumed I was eating 2000 and the reason I couldnâ€™t lose weight was my metabolism.
EDAnonymous,few56un,t3_eqo50p,1579405561.0,I make air popped popcorn and put a lot of those Kernel season stuff on it. Itâ€™s not zero calories but it does satisfy me more than say chips.
EatingIntuitively,fefpt6p,t3_eowzlc,1579061796.0,The same reason our â€œpresidentâ€ is a reality TV star.
fuckeatingdisorders,fefpgjt,t3_eopy32,1579061539.0,I was obese and started behaviors. Within about 8 months I was â€œtoo skinnyâ€ and people just then started worrying. And by then I was full on into it. I think a lot of us start out overweight or obese.
EDAnonymous,fedjb57,t3_eoimik,1579012967.0,I never am skinny in the morning because I usually binge at night and wake up bloated as hell.
EDAnonymous,fdn7k8n,t3_em54w0,1578579438.0,Yes. My husband steals food off my plate and I wouldnâ€™t be as upset if he would take the same food from the original container. What is on my plate is mine dammit!
antidiet,fdm9lub,t3_elx8wh,1578543251.0,"I will subscribe and watch all your videos! I love seeing people on t
YouTube who have recovered without becoming a raw vegan ðŸ™„. (Nothing against raw vegans by the way, it just seems like a common thing)"
EDAnonymous,fdj2hbs,t3_elknca,1578456727.0," Yep I totally do this, I weigh myself about three different times in three different spots in the bathroom to make sure that the weight is right. Iâ€™m also a huge dork and I calibrate it with a 10 pound dumbbell before I weigh myself."
fuckeatingdisorders,fdc7a4y,t3_ekkq7v,1578268496.0,"I noticed mainly that I felt better, although I did sleep more too. I had to wear forgiving clothes otherwise I really got triggered by tight pants. Also, my weight went to my stomach first and then my butt and legs later so I looked really weird for a bit."
childfree,fd6z1hi,t3_ek3dhv,1578197484.0,"I know a couple who would not adopt because they didnâ€™t want a â€œproblem childâ€. Their words, not mine. Not like their spawn was anything all that great."
EDAnonymous,fd5xa12,t3_ejwy0v,1578182660.0,Self check FTW. I only buy Miralax now but thatâ€™s embarrassing enough.
fatlogic,fd5wmk8,t3_ek3b3c,1578182425.0,"LifebyJen, a YouTuber who weighs 550-some pounds did an HONEST what I eat in a day and it was like 4500 some calories for not a whole lot of food. She said it really opened her eyes as to what she was really eating."
fuckeatingdisorders,fd00qa6,t3_ejownx,1578111891.0,Not sure what you eat currently or if you purge but doing it on your own can be fatal if you get refeeding syndrome.  You really should be under the care of a team.
fatlogic,fczzzci,t1_fcqf2lk,1578111552.0,Yeah they are. Fortified foods are made with vitamins that are made in a lab. By people. Vitamins that you find in plants and whole grains and meat etc are the same chemically speaking but you also got the phytonutrients and antioxidants you miss in the processed foods.
antidiet,fcwet9b,t3_ej01db,1578023802.0,"When I was obese and losing weight, I had a doctor appointment when I was in the normal BMI range and my doctor said â€œ you could lose more for aesthetics but you are technically healthy weight I guess â€œ. Why are doctors encouraging that unnecessary weight loss??"
fatlogic,fcweit8,t3_ej6o9x,1578023599.0,I have a history of an eating disorder and seeing my weight does stress me out BUT I get that my doctor needs to know it. The solution? Ask for a blind weight. They have never not been accommodating.
fatlogic,fcp6nkh,t3_ei5j3b,1577852228.0,I once had a lady tell me my arms were like toothpicks and asked if I ever ate. Then she told me to walk to the Burger King down the street and get a Whopper. Like...thatâ€™s totally not okay.
fatlogic,fcp6hh1,t3_eibhqb,1577852064.0,"This isnâ€™t totally wrong. Those foods do have nutrition, but most of it is fortified with man made vitamins and minerals and are not as good as what youâ€™d get from naturally occurring vitamins."
My600lbLife,fcp67gr,t3_ei5ce2,1577851793.0,When I was obese I seriously thought I ate 2500 calories a day max. Then I kept a real food log and looked up the calories for everything and it was like 4000 a day. I was gaining at the time but I wasnâ€™t 300 lbs yet. I think if you are honest itâ€™s easier to change.
EDAnonymous,fckgoo0,t3_ehjzsv,1577724925.0,I studied biochemistry and microbiology and know more about nutrition than most of my dietitians. It infuriated me when they would lie to me about stuff and tell me I just had to be okay with my body at itâ€™s set point which was â€œlikely in the higher weight rangeâ€. Like WTF.
fatlogic,fcixr5g,t3_eh89po,1577672354.0,"Food IS meant to be pleasurable. The problem is that most â€œfoodâ€ these days is not real food. Processed food is a mix of corn, oil, sugar, and preservatives to make it last. Itâ€™s good to eat(I guess) but itâ€™s really not food in my opinion."
antidiet,fcixim8,t3_ehf50g,1577672188.0,I like that opinion. And lots of people who eat Uber healthy all the time still die early from other things.
nutrition,fcixdmr,t3_ehdvsf,1577672093.0,Cholecalciferol is what they use in supplements and itâ€™s also what they add to milk so itâ€™s equivalent biologically. The issue comes with how much you take at once because you can only absorb so much at once.
fuckeatingdisorders,fcix2mw,t3_ehdo0y,1577671884.0,"Oh no I am sorry. How awful. This disease sucks, Iâ€™m sorry."
EDAnonymous,fcbxvx5,t3_egrim6,1577592195.0,Yeah every time I eat. Thanks effed up digestive tract.
EDAnonymous,fcbxqqb,t3_egtqaq,1577592148.0,"She was really underfat for a long time and she did change really fast. It will take her some time to get used to her new body, but Iâ€™m sure she has a bit of body image issues considering so many influencers are tiny and shredded."
EDAnonymous,fcbwsir,t3_egw4md,1577591839.0,I stay off the scale this week because I know itâ€™ll fuck with my head. Iâ€™m sure mines mostly water weight too. Lol.
EDAnonymous,fc7gc5b,t3_egiu8u,1577506593.0,Itâ€™s always some 17 year old who was underweight for 2 months and then put IP and is normal again after gaining back the weight. Talk to me after youâ€™ve had 3 or 4 iterations of ED and been suffering 20 years bitches.
fuckeatingdisorders,fc4d0y0,t3_eg4b7g,1577413126.0,Oh yeah Iâ€™m sorry you have an idiot too. My doctor told me to just start eating eggs like that will magically cure me. And when I opened up to her about abusing laxatives in the past she said â€œWhy would you do something that stupid?â€ Gotta love it.
nutrition,fc4cule,t3_eg32kh,1577412982.0,Phosphoric acid and the caramel color in them are really awful for your teeth and will stain and weaken them. Plus sugar if you choose the regular and artificial sweeteners if you choose the diet...nothing at all good in them.
EDAnonymous,fc1a2m1,t3_efkyzj,1577312603.0,Itâ€™s frightening how easily I could crush that 10000 calories challenge. It would not even be hard.
EDAnonymous,fc0uj1y,t3_effpgb,1577300006.0,I had my physical exam on Friday and my doctor was like â€œyou have no fat on your breasts at all and I can feel your intestines. How do you not see that you are very skinny?â€ She is a very sweet lady and very direct but yeah...my fat meaty legs throw me off every time.
EDAnonymous,fc0u75a,t3_efj5m1,1577299797.0,Iâ€™m lucky-my husband got me a gift card and told me to get anything I want. He knows how pissed I get when I get stuff thatâ€™s the wrong size.
EDAnonymous,fc0tea4,t3_efiwy9,1577299211.0,My issue is that I took two days off from my full workouts and I feel guilty as hell for not doing them and I keep thinking I will gain a million pounds from this. I freaking hate that I canâ€™t enjoy Christmas.
EDAnonymous,fc0t5u2,t3_efggcl,1577299067.0,Me!!!! I have such thick stumpy legs that when Iâ€™m a healthy weight they just look massive. Also my belly is huge and I have no boobs. So if I woke up looking like Charlize Theron but weighing 209 lbs I would totally be okay with that.
EDAnonymous,fc0syv8,t3_efh0yu,1577298948.0,For real. This disease has made me do some seriously dumb shit.
fuckeatingdisorders,fc0stty,t3_efc4ne,1577298862.0,Oh wow how triggering. I try to ignore people like that but when itâ€™s family and you have to spend Christmas around them itâ€™s hard.
fuckeatingdisorders,fc0sc5i,t3_efi06x,1577298502.0,Me too. Plus Iâ€™m always terrified my little nieces are going to pick up on my behaviors and that is the last thing I need.
fatlogic,fbzgwku,t1_fbzf55j,1577246293.0,Personal experience. I was fat shamed by my grandma and all it did was make me angry at her for being such a bitch. Saying someone looks like a water heater isnâ€™t a nice honest way of telling them the truth. I did lose weight but only when I had a doctor tell me that my PCOS was probably going to be lessened if I lost some weight. Big difference.
