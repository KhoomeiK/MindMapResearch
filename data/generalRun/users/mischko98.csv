AskReddit,fckm3n6,t1_fckkj10,1577728299.0,"That makes sense. How do I get her to do it though? I donâ€™t live there anymore and my mother is a very stubborn person and also rather lazy and unmotivated. When you tell her to do something sheâ€™ll just keep saying â€œIâ€™ll do it laterâ€ and eventually get mad if you persist. 

My siblings are too young to understand all this so I donâ€™t know how much I can help. My brother is nine years old and the special needs one is six years old and sheâ€™s got a really severe learning disability. 

Iâ€™ve always dreamt of doing something big like maybe pursuing a medical career or scientific research. But frankly I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll be able to get a degree in something like that if Iâ€™ve got my siblings to worry about. Iâ€™ve also always wanted to travel around the world. And be active in nature, hiking, swimming, climbing, diving, you name it, thereâ€™s all these things I want to do but how would I? 
Iâ€™m also stuck currently taking care of someone whoâ€™s been out of an occupation for like a year. I work a depressing minimum wage factory job with awful hours to pay their bills and mine. 
Honestly Iâ€™m just so sick of everything now. I feel trapped. I donâ€™t like my life. I just want to be far away from all this. Sorry for my rambling."
AskReddit,fckinag,t1_fckh72f,1577726163.0,"Sheâ€™s got bipolar disorder. The way she deals with it is mostly sleeping all day. And she never leaves the house with the kids because sheâ€™s so scared of social interactions. 
Yes the house is a complete mess. Thereâ€™s dirt and piles of stuff all over the floor. I visited this week actually and spent a whole day just literally just cleaning because it was so disgusting. The toilet made me retch. There were moldy vegetables in the fridge and I noticed today that the kettle Iâ€™ve used for a week to make tea for myself had a filter covered in white and black mould. My siblings donâ€™t feel close at all to my mum, just like i didnt either growing up. And yes my father tries his best to make up for it. 
It makes my life suffer because Iâ€™ve missed out on a lot of things in my youth like going out partying with friends because I had to take care of my siblings. Even when I was younger, before I had my license, I missed out because i couldnâ€™t go anywhere because we live in the middle of nowhere and my mum wouldnâ€™t drive me anywhere. So I had a very lonely childhood. And now I feel like i might not be able to pursue the career and life choices I want because I have to be there for my siblings. The youngest has special needs too. And one day when my father canâ€™t do it anymore Iâ€™m gonna have to take them in and care for them for the rest of my life. That is not what i imagined my life to be. I donâ€™t look forward to the future anymore. I havenâ€™t in a while. 

Thank you for your kind words it really means a lot to me right now"
AskReddit,fckgc17,t1_fckfthy,1577724701.0,My mumâ€™s mentally ill and doesnâ€™t take care of my younger siblings. Very neglectful and the house is a disgusting mess. My fatherâ€™s barely home. Iâ€™m in the middle of it and because Iâ€™m the only older sibling who can handle children (my older brother has anger issues) Iâ€™ve taken care of them a lot and my own life is suffering because of it.

unpopularopinion,fc52nuu,t1_fc4zdy4,1577439968.0,"I know how you feel. Iâ€™m in a similar boat. If you need to vent feel free to message me. 


My older sister is a functional person but has extremely severe learning difficulties which makes living a regular life on her own impossible for her. Years ago she ran off with another guy whoâ€™s also mentally challenged in a similar way and she got pregnant and refused to abort. Obviously she wasnâ€™t able to take care of her daughter and my parents decided to take her in (instead of giving her to a better home like I had suggested). 


That might sound cold hearted of me by the reason I said it is because my mother is mentally ill. Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s bipolar disorder but Iâ€™m not 100% sure because my parents and I never talked about it in depth. What this means for my niece is that sheâ€™ll be on her own all day basically. She will never get the attention and support she needs to flourish. My mother will provide food (sometimes almost rotten) and wash laundry but thatâ€™s about it.. she usually sleeps half the day and spends the remaining time scratching her face and staring out the window. The house is a fucking mess and my father has to fight for it every time to get my mum to do any cleaning. (Heâ€™s self employed and forced to work very long hours in a very physically demanding job). Itâ€™s dirty and thereâ€™s piles of stuff all over the floor and the kitchen always has that slightly sweet rotten smell. I moved out two years ago and it kills me every time to see the state of things when I visit them. Often when Iâ€™m there I have to fetch my niece and younger brother some clothes after I noticed theyâ€™ve been wearing the same pair of socks and underwear for three days. 


Iâ€™ve been taking a lot of care of my younger brother as well ever since he was born (when I was twelve years old) because he might as well have no mum and my dadâ€™s barely home anyway. It broke his little heart when I moved out and he still cries that Iâ€™m gone but I couldnâ€™t take it anymore. I couldnâ€™t focus on my life I was just taking care of children that I did not put into this world. 


Nowadays my father is pressuring me to come back, and I kinda want to because the guilt is eating me up inside most of the time, but I know itâ€™ll be the same again when Iâ€™m back. And one day Iâ€™m going to end up being stuck taking in my niece and taking care of her for the rest of my life and I hate it. Iâ€™m only 21, I should be able to live my own life. I know it sounds selfish but it really is a heavy burden on my shoulders and I wish I could be as happy and excited about life as others my age but because of all this I am not. 


Also where Iâ€™m living at the moment Iâ€™m currently taking care of someone whoâ€™s been out of an occupation for like a year and paying all their bills on top of mine when working a really depressing minimum wage job (chips factory...) and itâ€™s really taking a toll on me. Iâ€™m just tired of life at this point. Taking care of others has always been my life and seems like it always will be."
