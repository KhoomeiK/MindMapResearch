What Chase does is they ""clear"" checks when you deposit them by showing the increase in your balance but the funds don't actually hit the account for a couple days.  I worked at a law office where we deposited a check into a Chase escrow account and asked them specifically whether or not the funds were available for use to avoid the check bouncing.  They told us yes, the funds were available so we sent the check to the client.  Lo and behold a week later Chase bounced the check because the funds ""weren't available"" and the attorney was summoned to appear before the Bar Association to explain why the escrow check bounced.  We went to Chase demanding an explanation and they told us it wasn't their fault even though **they told us the funds were available for use**.  They wouldn't even write the attorney a letter explaining what happened and he was almost sanctioned until he thoroughly explained what had transpired.  So just because this guy was able to deposit them into a Chase account doesn't necessarily mean the checks were officially cleared.  They just bounce them later if they find a reason to."

He knew once the Allies established a beachhead he would be unable to stop them given the overwhelming resource advantage the Allies had.  Hitler, however, was unwilling to grant Rommel's request for tanks to repel the invasion; instead he held the reserve up because he was convinced the Normandy invasion was a feint and the real invasion would be by way of Pas de Calais and he also believed that the tank reserve should be kept inland to avoid being destroyed by Allied sea power.

The signs were relayed electronically to the thumper, who then communicated to the batter what the pitch was going to be, which is just relaying the electronically-received signal.

One reason they can't punish the players individually is because there is no concrete way to measure or determine too what extent players took part and quantify how much that actually helped them.  Should the players who didn't take part but knew about it be punished the same way as those who did take part?  How do you even determine if a player is lying or not if they say they didn't take part or know?  Say Altuve says he had no idea about the system and never participated, but others say he not only knew but had an active role in the whole thing.  How can you conclusively prove who knew what?  It's just an impossible target to hit.

Another reason they can't punish the players individually is that many of them have moved on to other teams, so now by potentially suspending those players who cheated while in Houston you're punishing their current teams who had nothing to do with what happened back then.

The best solution, as I mentioned in a comment above, would have been for the league to strip the title.  It punishes the players collectively, not individually, while minimizing the collateral damage to other parties who weren't involved.  It placates the fans and other teams by declaring that cheating is not okay and won't be tolerated, which would hopefully restore the fans' faith in the fairness of the game.  It lets other teams know that they will be punished severely if anything like this ever happens again (Any team would happily trade the penalties the league levied on the Astros for a World Series title).  The players who cheated can still play baseball but they lose the right to call themselves champions.  It would have been a symbolic punishment that would have been fair for everyone."
baseball,fehiq0u,t1_fegqr3c,1579117357.0,"Which is why I think vacating the title would have been the perfect solution for everyone.  Leaving a giant hole in the 2017 record books would be a reminder to everyone that the Astros cheated to win that year and would placate the fans and other teams.  It also allows MLB to avoid punishing the players individually, but still allows the league to punish them collectively by taking away the ability to call themselves champions while not punishing the teams that currently employ members of that cheating 2017 team.  It's a neat solution that works for all parties involved, but apparently the league doesn't have the balls to actually do it."

The idea was to levy a punishment so severe that it would deter teams from ever doing something like this again, and quite frankly I'm sure most teams would gladly take this punishment if it allowed them to win the World Series.

That sums it up right there.  If there was a Hall of Good I think he'd be in it, but come on.  In his sixteen years in the league he went to four Pro Bowls.  That's it.

Great, he was a durable QB who didn't miss many games, but was he ever even a top-5 QB at any point in his career?  I think [this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/eli-manning-was-an-all-time-average-qb/) sum it up perfectly.  He had two amazing runs (with a lot of help from his defense) and that's it.  Are people really going to vote him in for two playoff runs?

The GOP has blamed anything and everything on Obama even in the face of logic and common sense, and a lot of people are too stupid and gullible to think for themselves."
AskReddit,fdexp21,t1_fde956v,1578348803.0,"This is absolutely the correct response.  If you say ""Yes"", their next question will be ""Okay, why do you think I pulled you over?"" at which point you, thinking you're being honest and forthcoming, tell them you were speeding or doing something unsafe.  By doing that you waive your Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination because you have just admitted you broke the law.  You always play dumb and never ever admit you did anything wrong.  If they ask you how fast you were going you always answer ""The speed limit""."

worldnews,fdcyb8m,t1_fdcte92,1578287930.0,"The hard measures the Radical Republicans took because of Lincoln's assassination is what set back the whole reconstruction effort.  Lincoln wanted to welcome the South back and make the transition as easy as possible for them and when he was killed the Republicans brought the hammer down.  Had they hung all the leaders of the Confederacy it would have antagonized again all those Southerners that had rebelled in the first place, which is exactly what Lincoln was looking to avoid.  John Wilkes Booth didn't accomplish his goal of rekindling the Confederacy, but he completely destroyed any chance of a peaceful reunification."

I tried to reach her once I found out she was in hospice (she's in Germany, I'm in the U.S.) but I couldn't get her on the phone.  Not a day has gone by since where I haven't wished that I had tried harder to reach her to to have reached her earlier.  I never was able to even say goodbye or to tell her how much I loved her before she passed and that'll probably be with me the rest of my life.
