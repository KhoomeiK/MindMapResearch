Advice,ff0bbe7,t1_fez0eq7,1579467167.0,"Yeah in Australia it's not as affordable as it sounds sadly, and scholarships usually cover book fees if anything and maybe they give you a free laptop or something

My thoughts would be to take the scholarship, see how you go for a few months and construct a plan to defend against these psychological attacks. Usually with people like this it helps to deflect anything they say, and when they use this to start arguments, keeping your cool is the most helpful thing you can do for yourself. Just pretend like their major issues are minor problems, and your time isn't worth spent on them. I know this sounds disrespectful but if this lady is anything like my mum you've got to just be dismissive of destructive or harmful behaviour.

You should definitely take the opportunity with the scholarship imho, as someone who gave up most of their opportunities at uni to work more hours outside of work I'd say it was a huge mistake."
