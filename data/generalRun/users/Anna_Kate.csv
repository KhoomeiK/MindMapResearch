At road speeds, if you're close enough to hear the bell, you're too close for it to make any difference. I have a bell, it came with my bike because it's a legal requirement: it's right over in the centre of my handlebars where I can't actually reach it and it has _never_ rung.

Move out right a bit, that's my advice. It gives you more time to react and room to manoeuvre if a pedestrian suddenly steps into the road, and it discourages reckless overtaking by motorists behind - if they've got to go onto the other side of the road, they tend to go all the way over, whereas if they think they can get by without crossing the line then they _will_!"

The accent is weird and a few words like 'cleped' have fallen into disuse alongside the thorn symbol, but once it's decoded and spoken this is pretty clearly English - just the kind of English you might hear from an old man in an isolated village on a remote island somewhere. Once you've got the rhythm of it everything falls into place and you find yourself fluently reading Chaucer in the original and giggling at the filthy jokes.

What happened between then and Shakespeare that makes the later material more accessible? Partly the spelling, I think, which is a struggle for modern readers. In Shakespeare's day the printing press was beginning to standardise English spelling, and it tended to favour the styles used in the southeast, where London, Oxford and Cambridge were doing all the writing. Think how many King James Bibles were printed, one in every village, and once literacy got going one in every home. A divinely endorsed standard English for all.

And partly, of course, Shakespeare is more intelligible because he's _Shakespeare_. He had quite a big cultural impact of his own - bit of a cult following, you might say, and some lasting popularity. If God couldn't make that dialect stick, four hundred years of English teachers going through the Immortal Bard generation after generation sure could!"

Every new electric car commissioned is a large _additional_ load on the power grid, which means we must keep on burning gas that much longer until we get enough clean energy in place.

The electric car certainly does us the great courtesy of _not_ belching out its filth right into our faces on every city street, so that's a big plus - but in terms of staving off climate disaster a little longer, it isn't any substitute for the urgent abolition of the single occupancy private car as society's default means of transport."
television,fddjrcg,t1_fddgzbf,1578315022.0,"'Nuclear waste' covers a whole lot of different things. A lot of it is, say, the technicians' old lab coats, or the gloves used to handle the materials. Or building rubble left over from decommissioning. It's radioactive, it's dangerous, but it's not exactly apocalyptic.

The troublesome stuff is the spent fuel rods. They're intensely radioactive and they'll stay that way for a long, long time: they present a serious storage problem. But what do we mean by 'spent'?

Nuclear fission, the splitting of atoms to produce lighter elements and release energy, produces all sorts of isotopes in there which poison the nuclear reaction and make the fuel useless - long before the fuel is all used up! This is where we declare the fuel rod to be spent, remove it and stick it in a deep hole somewhere. 

Ideally we would reprocess these fuel rods: remove the waste chemicals and recover the good fuel. I think it's something like 95% of it is still there! So that reduces the amount of waste by a factor of twenty: one part _really_ horrible, refined and concentrated nightmare, to nineteen parts useable nuclear fuel. The stuff you remove is downright _awful_, but there's a whole lot less of it, and its half-life is generally a lot shorter.

As it stands, though, this process is too expensive. Freshly mined uranium is readily available, and there was a glut of spare plutonium from nuclear disarmament after the end of the Cold War that flooded the market for years on end. It's been cheaper just to manufacture entirely new fuel rods, and let the old ones stand in a waste storage facility somewhere."

If operators of autonomous cars, when not actually using them, find it cheaper to store them by having them prowl the road in circles rather than pay to park - then the answer is to bill them for use of the road, not to offer them the parking space for free!"

But I've never understood why it isn't rented. Surely you don't become a billionaire by leaving money on the table like that! Do they simply not want the bother? Then why not set up a property management company to run many such flats?

Showerthoughts,fcpu4rv,t1_fcp4kcr,1577872178.0,"Bit too modern. Robert is a Tudor through and through: he settled the kingdom's internal power struggle by a subtle combination of politically astute marriage and extreme violence, but later preferred hunting, feasting and lechery to the hard work of administration and eventually grew disgracefully fat. Despite claims of illegitimacy and rumours of scandal, even of incest, he left three heirs - gold would be their thrones! - but the succession was never entirely without controversy as different lords backed different candidates, occasionally throwing up some _very_ short lived pretenders.

Pity what became of Myrcella, because going by historical parallel she should have been Elizabeth and so ought to have been an _extremely_ successful Queen. Thoroughly trained in the game of thrones by an adolescence passed in the hands of her enemies and in fear of her life, Elizabeth was intelligent, cunning, comparatively humane where possible, completely ruthless where necessary, and refused to compromise either her own independence by marriage or her country's independence by submission to any outside authority to the south. Oh. And she was also ginger. So maybe she showed up in the story after all.

edit: if you can't bear to wait any longer for the next book, try reading Wolf Hall, and if you thought the ending of the TV series was awful then try watching Wolf Hall. It's the story of Thomas Cromwell, a commoner who rose to become... let's call it Hand of the King to Henry VIII: his career was one of deadly dangerous political intrigue in an unstable regime around a terribly hot tempered king. The final part of the trilogy is out in March; spoilers for the ending leaked 480 years ago, so be careful what you read!"
