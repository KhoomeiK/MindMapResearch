FundieSnark,ffhe0cq,t3_ethv2u,1579931415.0,Is this for handmaid’s tale?
DeadBedrooms,ffba4n0,t3_eslkk7,1579756974.0,"I would be honest but vague. Say you haven’t been happy for years, you’ve tried counseling which helped clear up a lot of miscommunication. However it made you realize that you guys are fundamentally different people who want fundamentally different things out of a marriage. It’s not fair for you to stay when you’ve been so unhappy. 

Paints a pretty clear pictures without putting your business out there."
self,ff8bjkq,t1_ff7xpx3,1579671926.0,Exactly. There’s pretty much always a price
webdev,ff4c0s1,t1_ff42rve,1579560064.0,I didn’t have all the details you had but I figured it was marketing.
fatlogic,ff0at5u,t1_ff09vda,1579466980.0,Honestly I was thinking more about the women I know than men. Men typically have such higher caloric requirements that they can meal and snack. I know plenty of men who don’t watch what they eat at all since they play soccer 3x a week and are generally active. They don’t eat recklessly but seem to know have to think much about their diet.
blackladies,feyg7wv,t1_fey84t1,1579445087.0,I think that organic relationship is key. Plus seeing how he is around his friends really plays a key in seeing how someone is as a life partner.
fatlogic,feyfw74,t1_feychzn,1579444958.0,It’s the snacking that does it. Most of the “naturally skinny” people I know either don’t snack or are grazer and don’t eat full meals.
progresspics,fewhbv6,t3_eqn03e,1579410584.0,How was your energy at 77lbs? Like i can’t imagine being able to do much at such a low weight. How do you feel now? This is in terms of energy and your ability to do things? Are you less sluggish?
relationships,fepb552,t3_eq5ays,1579316244.0,"Honestly the whole giving them back the same energy as they give you, while important, is somewhat secondary to the simple fact that you don’t like Science Fiction or Star Wars. 

Even if you hadn’t brought up his parents shitty behavior, this doesn’t change the fact you’re not interested in what they’re watching. And honestly that’s all his parents need to know. 

And what he needs to know is that you are no longer going to pretend to like things just for his parents’ approval, just like they never pretended to like stuff for your approval."
fatlogic,fen59kn,t3_eq0je2,1579277267.0,This actually looks pretty accurate to how I looked around that weight at 6’4. My boobs were bigger but I had a relatively flat stomach.
kpop,fe3f3qh,t1_fe0qz5d,1578848742.0,You sound hella sensitive
AskReddit,fdzry7j,t3_en7n9i,1578794388.0,"Mark Walberg. That asshole. 

Everyone now and then I make an exception, like with the Departed, but overall I can’t stand him."
pics,fdtzte8,t3_en2ia6,1578724981.0,Such a handsome man. And he’s older than Captain America.
webdev,fdtoj6h,t1_fdthnrg,1578719774.0,Thanks. Weirdest looking seal I’ve ever seen. Do you know if they all typically look like this? Is it photoshopped?
webdev,fdt9fhm,t3_en154h,1578713648.0,What is that?
relationships,fdollkl,t1_fdol752,1578607625.0,Agreed. But it seems like she does take care of the baby but wants to have some fun every now and then. Which is also important. Shouldn’t be smoking though.
relationships,fdokogd,t1_fdoivpk,1578607081.0,And HE decided to fuck and marry her. So he can lay in the bed of his decisions too.
television,fdohqfq,t1_fdnpema,1578605383.0,"But this is the current process. Your statement made it seem like there was a change in the judicial process. Or that a right we previously had has been taken away. 

I’m not disagreeing about bullshit warrants but that’s a power they have always had. There’s no need to be anymore terrified then you already were since nothing has changed."
television,fdnbz2d,t1_fdnaev0,1578582501.0,"Why? I would be scared if it wasn’t court ordered but this went through the normal due process. 

Police have to get a court order to get your DNA or search your house. How is this any more invasive?"
AskReddit,fdlhu6c,t1_fdjztea,1578524338.0,I love how this is all a reasonable deduction based off the evidence you had.
dataisbeautiful,fdjdhgb,t1_fdhhfaa,1578466300.0,"My biggest issue is that Leo seems incapable and unwilling to date a women over 25. Makes the women look really disposable imo. 

So less to do with a hard rule about age gaps and more to do with Leo’s inability to find romantic value in an older women. 

It’s also just very strange to have real data to go with the gossip/rumor that he has a hard age limit."
relationships,fdhavnh,t3_elcbeg,1578419083.0,"Apply. You don’t even know if you got it. If you do, then start worrying and planning. You’re counting chickens before they hatch. Also your home life sounds unhealthy."
AskReddit,fdfnzen,t3_el2az5,1578366099.0,Someone from Euphoria. And tbh I'm fine with that.
whole30,fde1cpz,t1_fddq6l1,1578328962.0,Would mash worked better or is grated better?
whole30,fde1b2j,t1_fddq6l1,1578328933.0,Making this!
AskReddit,fddk1js,t1_fdd3hqk,1578315322.0,Idk the college students I know definitely feel like they’re paying for it. But I also only know A/B students.
AskReddit,fdcul7a,t1_fdcquju,1578284749.0,"this is even crazier to me since they're paying to be there. It's one thing to fail twice in High School, it's another to fail twice at the college you're paying to go to."
videos,fda3s65,t1_fd7o6zx,1578241351.0,Smoke inhalation?
unpopularkpopopinions,fcyj0ay,t1_fcaotqq,1578080865.0,"All kpop is artificial but some are more artificial than others.

TXT seems the most artificial. Even their singing seems very artificial. At least with BTS, we hear Jimin’s voice crack every now and then. 

TXT feels like they have a filter over them."
PlantBasedDiet,fcwnatw,t1_fcw648j,1578030534.0,"Idk, I read some of it and it wasn’t very AAVE. More just crass with a lot of cursing."
webdev,fcwmh4f,t1_fcwm9d7,1578029801.0,Wow I hadn’t realized their SEO was so poor. Especially since they market it as being really good.
webdev,fcwkcog,t1_fcwj6r2,1578028002.0,Do you do that within the existing Squarespace/Wix site or create something new?
webdev,fcwdx28,t1_fcvsl6s,1578023178.0,How are you able to solve for that?
bangtan,fcvmxy9,t3_efyyfo,1578005561.0,Not on actually tv here in the US but I can see one of the streaming networks buying it
ProgrammerHumor,fcuqe2z,t1_fctl9c8,1577986391.0,That’s not really their purpose tbh. It’s sort by shape/size not color.
pics,fcupx2c,t1_fcuh3ay,1577986131.0,Are you the first to wear it after her or have other relatives worn it?
FundieSnark,fcukg51,t1_fcsfl6a,1577983006.0,"I agree. And the comments about her height. She’s probably insecure about it. I think she’s over 6ft tall, and clearly wants to appear more dainty than she is."
relationship_advice,fcucxa0,t1_fcu7y0h,1577978029.0,My aunt was able to divorce in less than 6month. Mostly because nothing was contested and they didn’t have any joint assets or kids.
worldnews,fctdoj2,t1_fctcj1a,1577939980.0,What does this have to do with Biden?
AskReddit,fcp941r,t3_eic8yl,1577854662.0,Yes!! So much yes. I dream of this. I’d be in college and would made some better life choices. So many better choices.
bangtan,fco1uxx,t1_fcmzfna,1577822555.0,Looking fine
kpop,fc7mmyj,t1_fc5xzbt,1577512457.0,I don’t get the downvotes either. That’s a compliment. Big Bang’s end of year stages are legendary.
badroommates,fc7lgrk,t1_fc7kprn,1577511283.0,That’s going to get her killed.
television,fc7hgaa,t1_fc74zmp,1577507552.0,Complete noob to it but I loved the timeline jumping . It was like a mystery because I could tell something was off but couldn’t figure out what. And then the reveal that it was all taking place at different times was a nice surprise.
pics,fc365dr,t1_fc2o48t,1577382395.0,"Probably family. There’s a large Cuban population in the USA. I wouldn’t be surprised if he had family in Florida. If not family, he definitely has community. I don’t think he would get the same in Peru"
whole30,fbzsmvu,t1_fbf3atd,1577259405.0,I second this. I was most successful when I did the whole30 not to lose weight but because I was having some bad digestive issues. It helped me stay motivated in a way a diet or weight lost wouldn’t. You need a good motivation because change is hard.
