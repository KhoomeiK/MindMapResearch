It sounds like you spend too much time in your head, you need to get the fuck out of your head and just start doing something. Start a new hobby, start mma and create long term friendships. That’s just an example but I suggest you find a hobby or something to do that will get you out and put you in a group of people who will pick you up and help you on your journey. Life is hard alone, we are social animals. Long term solitary breeds bad habits and depression. You get stuck in a negative pattern and before you know it you’ve been doing it so long it’s ingrained into your subconscious mind so it becomes automatic like the motions of brushing your teeth or checking your phone as soon as you wake up. I suggest you listen to or read “3 magic words” it’s a very powerful book. There is no religion or any bullshit in there, it’s real shit that will change your life.

If you have any recommendations of consistent quality vendors please let me know, some good flower on a budget preferably! 

Looking for a solid vendor to stay with because I’ve been screwed by this same vendor 3 times (only ordered 3 times lol) ended up throwing out an ounce and a half of 3 total ounces. It hurts but I’d rather be safe than sorry.

I recommend checking out r/hempflowers 
They have recommend vendors and stuff"
Petioles,fdzfha3,t3_enbd22,1578789687.0,"If you have any trouble buy some good cbd flower to taper off with, you’d be surprised how well it works! After just a week with the cbd I don’t crave anything anymore. It destimulates the endo-cannabinoid system which THC stimulates it and over stimulates with heavy use leading to over eating, habitual vices, over indulgence etc. I believe this is why people like you and I have such a hard time stopping, when you smoke the cbd flower you are still getting minuscule amounts of thc which helps a lot because it’s gradually taping off from thc rather than cold turkey which is very hard sometimes."

Also I 100% agree, I’ve been turning down quite a lot of shit companies that put on a good facade at first, but after a little digging things get messy. I am new to the whole saas field though, and am unfamiliar with the right questions to ask. Any sources you would recommend that I can educate myself on these types of things so i can ask more accurate questions in interviews? Btw I appreciate your responses and time, thanks!

If you have any recommendations of consistent quality vendors please let me know, some good flower on a budget preferably! 

Looking for a solid vendor to stay with because Iâ€™ve been screwed by this same vendor 3 times (only ordered 3 times lol) ended up throwing out an ounce and a half of 3 total ounces. It hurts but Iâ€™d rather be safe than sorry. 

Maybe itâ€™s time to try some indoor"

Itâ€™s a great medicine but damn I spend more time checking and being paranoid within the last 2 months then I have for the last 7 years Iâ€™ve smoked weed."

You get a clear â€œeuphoriaâ€, very clear headed and able to do whatever. 

I recommend checking out r/hempflowers 
They have recommend vendors and stuff"
Petioles,fdzfha3,t3_enbd22,1578789687.0,"If you have any trouble buy some good cbd flower to taper off with, youâ€™d be surprised how well it works! After just a week with the cbd I donâ€™t crave anything anymore. It destimulates the endo-cannabinoid system which THC stimulates it and over stimulates with heavy use leading to over eating, habitual vices, over indulgence etc. I believe this is why people like you and I have such a hard time stopping, when you smoke the cbd flower you are still getting minuscule amounts of thc which helps a lot because itâ€™s gradually taping off from thc rather than cold turkey which is very hard sometimes."

Also I 100% agree, Iâ€™ve been turning down quite a lot of shit companies that put on a good facade at first, but after a little digging things get messy. I am new to the whole saas field though, and am unfamiliar with the right questions to ask. Any sources you would recommend that I can educate myself on these types of things so i can ask more accurate questions in interviews? Btw I appreciate your responses and time, thanks!

Luckily weed isnâ€™t bad for the lungs for most people until it gets to very heavy use for over 50 years, now with that said weed is extremely unique in that regard. Most these inhaled will almost certainly cause some kind of harm to your lungs, now these people are making fake rolling papers (a very low ticket product that can be bought for cheap ) now do you think that they care about what happens after we purchase these fake papers? No. Thatâ€™s why they cut corners and make them in the cheapest way possible, no idea what these are made of and Iâ€™m not taking the risk. Iâ€™ve had the hemp raws before
