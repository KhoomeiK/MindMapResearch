One fun thought for such things - have the baby ""magicked away"" before birth, if you don't wanna do a birthing scene. 

Another fun thought - time flows differently/not at all in some realms. So, what seems like a short while for you could be years and years for someone in, say, the Feywild. Years and years to grow up, be trained for some dark purpose, and used as an agent to make sure you don't mess with said dark purpose."

dndmemes,ffzeid3,t3_evzgks,1580375012.0,"I like it. And shall adapt it in my D&D games as follows:

Concubus - Fiends that feed off of the emotional, spiritual, and physical energies of love and lust within mortals. Being Divine in origin, it's spirit is above any specific ""gender"" and assumes the one it wants to. Or, in this particular case, changes it at will and as needed.

Incubus - Male form.

Succubus - Female form.

These are, technically speaking, neither Devil nor Demon(as those are Greater Fiends and have souls, Divine sparks/signatures, because they used to be mortal people). Concubi are Lesser Fiends - they form and gestate in the spiritually-charged muck and filth of the Lower Planes, rising up to inhabit all of them. 

Concubi feed first off of souls imprisoned in such places, and then, with a bit of luck, off of the souls of the living once summoned. A Concubus can become strong enough by doing this over millennia to rise in station to become a Greater Fiend, or can be invested with such power by a Demon Lord or an Archdevil if their service earns sufficient praise, and thus they serve such dark masters. Some even serve mortals, quietly hoping to ensnare, subsume, and rise up using the soul of said mortal.

Concubi are creatures of shifting form and identity and thus, most have an insubstantial sense of self and are focused more on their craving for lust than on such philosophical questions as identity. Once ascended or promoted, they tend to become more set on one form and name, and many abandon the abilities of the Concubus altogether in favor of new identities and forms(All Greater Fiends can shapeshift in my settings, as can Archfey, as can Celestials, et cetera)."
BPD,ffzdulz,t3_evy5b8,1580374085.0,"This is a big part of why I've stopped pursuing relationships. Definitely in the short term while I stabilize, and probably in the long term, as well. I have three rules.

1. No dates or romance. It ends badly.

2. Safe coping methods. Provide a safe outlet while the stressor is a small thing, and it won't get to be a big thing.

3. Stay within my safety network. Known friends, family, doctors. No voyages or adventures - those complicate things, and complications end badly.

Thus far, it seems to be working. When I'm lonely or need contact, I have a platonic friend for that. When I'm upset, I have both electronic and physical outlets for it. And above all, by avoiding relationships, I'm avoiding all those lovely mountains and valleys of emotion that come with them. I'll gladly trade the highs if it saves me from the lows.

Can't speak to what you're going through, but as a guy with kids, I need to be stable - and I'm not gonna be able to progress at all if I can't keep that stability."

DMAcademy,fedx17k,t3_eojqpx,1579021691.0,"I like this approach for a few reasons, and have something to add to it - Guard Squads. Take a few flat discs or squares of Gargantuan size, maybe cut out of cardboard or something, and tape or glue on to them a picture of a bunch of guards. This is now a Gargantuan swarm of Medium-sized Guards, with the following changes to the Guard stat block:

Swarm: Can occupy other creatures' space, and can't be flanked.

Reactive: Can take one reaction each turn.

Multiattack: Makes four attacks. Has advantage on any attack against creatures whose space it is occupying.

Volley: Pick a space, everything within 10 feet of it has to make a DC13 DEX save or take 8d8 piercing damage, half as much on a save(or fire damage, or poison damage, if your Guards are so equipped).

HP: Multiply by 10, add 50.
