Dreams,fcvg6ns,t3_eiyug2,1578001416.0,"There was this time in a dream I was in a Victorian/Gothic looking castle and I was jumping up high over the stairs into higher rooms, like a high jumping video game character. 

At one point, I slipped on one of the stairs and fell, and seemingly woke up inside my high school, where friends of mine were playing ping pong. It wasn’t long until the match turned into a sort of fight, and one of the ping pong balls hit straight into my eye, which was when I woke up in real life."
happy,fcoilkh,t3_ei0k6m,1577833120.0,You cut your weigh in half!!
suggestmeabook,fcmbk2p,t1_fclzjys,1577769641.0,"Well the classics aren’t for everyone. The novel itself was the last by a very prominent author, who also wrote, presumably the greatest short story ever written, “The Lottery”."
suggestmeabook,fckm5oz,t3_ehnubu,1577728334.0,"This isn’t that exactly, but “We Have Always Lived in the Castle” by Shirley Jackson is close-ish, and is technically a classic."
suggestmeabook,fckkdzj,t1_fck72h5,1577727240.0,And there were these spells involved if I’m not mistaken using these certain drawings and it would them do different things. Like they’d write down the spells and kaboom
Music,fck2yer,t3_ehioa4,1577715015.0,"Is it just me, or does the song seem a bit gothic in nature? We were on the bud to our annual Math Team competitions and it was raining outside and this song came on through Spotify and it’s stuck with me ever since."
happy,fcj1s9r,t1_fcijfoq,1577675137.0,"Yeah, and I’ve read things about how statistically, it is more likely to last. It just makes sense."
suggestmeabook,fciirtd,t1_fcbdopj,1577663237.0,"Actually, after thinking about it, I am quite certain I read this one in 5th grade! Correct me if I am mistaken, but doesn’t it involve people creating these drawings and having them fight each other?"
fearsineverknewihad,fcbgbyy,t1_fcb8d9g,1577586518.0,Basically. That video does frighten me on its own. I mean like you start walking while off the treadmill and when you step onto it from the side thats when it really hits me.
teenagers,fcarb5o,t3_egus5g,1577575074.0,I say “A Santa lived as a devil at NASA” because it is a likewise palindrome.
fearsineverknewihad,fcaqp81,t1_fcaqn48,1577574697.0,"Even when it’s off, it’s the fear of it suddenly turning on that creeps me out"
fearsineverknewihad,fcaqjm4,t1_fcagvyh,1577574604.0,"Precisely. When both my feet stand on it as I’m walking by, I get terrible chills."
fearsineverknewihad,fcac5nk,t1_fca9evn,1577566553.0,"No, I mean like if the treadmill is going north to south, you are on the east side of it looking straight ahead, which would be to the west. If you walk over to the west side of the treadmill by stepping on the treadmill to get over there, it scares the hell out of me."
MarkMyWords,fc9tps5,t3_egonfb,1577558084.0,"3, take it or leave it."
teenagers,fc9tbr1,t3_egqt4s,1577557912.0,"I mean, you can be racist without saying the N word."
happy,fc935uw,t1_fc92lmc,1577546272.0,Well I’m happy for you and I wish you good luck
nostalgia,fc8xkco,t3_egksy7,1577543687.0,"I’m genuinely surprised my grandpa isn’t the only grandpa that had one of these. I had no idea. My grandpa joined the Navy during Vietnam, and so he really got into fishing."
happy,fc8x8oz,t3_egm9jx,1577543539.0,"You know, dating your best friend gives you an even better chance of you guys lasting in the long run. I’m happy for you."
Dreams,fc8x1xc,t3_eggo9q,1577543447.0,Shut your mouth you mediocre clarinet player.
suggestmeabook,fc42pvb,t1_fc42o9p,1577405071.0,Interesting. Thank you so much!
suggestmeabook,fc42coi,t1_fc40hec,1577404795.0,I actually started reading that one a few nights ago and got a third of the way done in just about an hour so I’ll get back to it. Thank you!
suggestmeabook,fc42a9m,t1_fc40s8u,1577404746.0,"In your opinion, is it better than The Call of the Wild?"
suggestmeabook,fc40do6,t1_fc3nnqj,1577403317.0,"Apparently it is literally the 99,999,999th bestselling book on Barnes&Noble’s website"
suggestmeabook,fc1weho,t1_fc0w6o2,1577331776.0,I researched this book for quiz bowl and it really hit me.
