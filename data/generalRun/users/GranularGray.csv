I think just starting with the question of ""who would stand with Iran?"" would be just as effective without deliberately angering the person you're arguing with."

A fantastic example would be someone like Devin Townsend. In general he's known for making rock and metal music, but if you look through his quite expansive discography he's written songs in any genre you could name from country to blues to hardcore, just to name a few. Now it seems like he's mostly sticking to progressive rock/metal, but he throws in some weird stuff pretty frequently."

spacex,fddg6qp,t1_fdd9fgd,1578310841.0,"Maybe, but I think the issue is less about the direct visual impact, and more so about the light reflecting off the satellites creating lens flare on telescopes."
spacex,fddfxaw,t1_fdddfey,1578310502.0,"No there will be 12,000 satellites in the entire constellation. Or at least that's what they're planning for initial coverage. The entire constellation will take place at 3 specific altitudes, each of those altitudes will have several planes (meaning a single orbit that all 60 satellites will follow) of satellites that cross over each other in a planned manner much like a woven pattern. Each plane will require 60 satellites spread over that plane to provide sufficient coverage.

Yes, there will always be satellites overhead (side note: there already are), but if you go and look at the examples of what the constellation will look like you will see just how much distance there is. Not only between separate planes, but also the distance between each specific satellite in that plane. The odds of having more than 2 or 3 within the distance that the human eye can see are incredibly low, I mean we're talking miles and miles (Or kilometers and kilometers if you prefer) of distance from one satellite to the next closest."
spacex,fdd8x3p,t1_fdd1bqu,1578300252.0,"The reason that there is always such a large reaction right after launch is because people watch and film the satellites when they're just starting to separate, and are clustered close together. By the time all 60 satellites are spread over the plane they occupy you'll only be able to see one or two at a time if you happen to be underneath that plane. Even once they have been fully deployed for world coverage in 2021, I would be surprised if there was any visual difference to the human eye.

It could have an effect on telescopes, but I think we're close to reaching the edge of what we can view with a telescope from the surface of earth anyway. Telescopes in orbit seem to be the future of astronomy in my opinion. There's less light pollution, as well as being above all the debris already in orbit around the earth that might obscure visual data.

Edit: I was on mobile and it kept adding a second ""t"" to the word satellite, so I fixed that."

Edit: Not to mention that traffic is going to continue increasing as the population increases anyway. The solution to solving traffic is never going to be removing cars from roads, the population will just continue to increase thus leading back to the same amount of traffic. The solution is to figure out a system that doesn't accumulate congestion."

As far as dealing with the mess, I imagine you would just deal with it on the way to your next destination, then send the car to a cleaning facility that could be set up to work on self-driving vehicles(it would probably still need to be staffed to make sure it's cleaned sufficiently, but I don't think it would be necessary to have the owner present to check in a self-driven car, just a consent through an app or something like that). Then tell your car to go back to Uber mode when it's done, or to come to pick you up."

todayilearned,fcyef4g,t1_fcyd735,1578078897.0,"Well, people like Elon Musk are already talking about the possibility of eventually having to implement some sort of universal basic income that everyone would receive that would cover the cost of living. Then anyone who wants to spend their personal time making their own business or making art, or do whatever they aspire to do; can do that without having to worry about if they're going to make enough money or not.

&#x200B;

Sure this could lead to people getting lazy and just spend their time watching TV (which would be so different from now right? /s), but I think most people have that creative drive where if you just sit them in a room long enough they'll get bored and want to make or do something."
todayilearned,fcycnii,t1_fcyal1n,1578078093.0,"I definitely agree with that, but I think their will always be people who just want to own a car. Even just as a status symbol to say that they own a car."

todayilearned,fcybjvz,t1_fcyb79m,1578077702.0,"Eventually, that could be the outcome, but I think that will take time to come together. My idea is more for the early adopters that want a supplemental income before the giant corporations have oversaturated the industry."

todayilearned,fcya7s1,t1_fcxqrhy,1578076999.0,That's why it would only be for the people who are willing to spend a couple of hours cleaning up their car for the opportunity to earn a little extra money.

todayilearned,fcy9pux,t1_fcy8jre,1578076775.0,"And this is one of the reasons why I don't think car ownership is going anywhere in the near future. People grow attached to their vehicles like it's part of their family, and when it eventually dies or becomes too much of a hassle to maintain; it leaves a hole in your life that needs to be filled by another vehicle that you feel just as attached to.

That's why I only see renting out your own vehicle as something a few people might see as another source of income."

Unless they spent the time to vomit on every surface of your car I can't see it taking longer than a couple of hours to clean any messes made, and if it really was that bad at that point I imagine Uber would be happy to charge the passenger more if they get a cut of it. I'll take $150 for a couple of hours of cleaning, $75/hr is triple what I make at my full time job, I'll clean up shit, piss, and vomit for that much money."

todayilearned,fcxjp9u,t1_fcx4xzv,1578064607.0,"Until you take it to the next level and have your car act as an uber while you're at work or otherwise not using it. Potentially earning you money for not using your car.

Obligatory Thanks for the Silver edit so I can talk more about this, cause it's an interesting topic: 
As many people have pointed out, there are some problems with the idea of renting out your self-driving car. Such as damage/messes in your car, or the eventual monopolization/extinction of car ownership.

I believe rideshare services such as Uber offer the option to fine a passenger if given evidence of significant damage to your vehicle. Now as far as if that is enough to cover the costs of repairs; I'm not really sure, but I think that as the technology advances to the point that this even becomes a possibility; More and more people will see this as a potential secondary source of income."
