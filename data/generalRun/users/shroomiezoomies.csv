BlackPeopleTwitter,ffeckd2,t3_et0j31,1579843141.0,Heaven for-fucking-bid people want to maintain a sense of dignity by honestly earning some money. Next time I go to a big city I'm bringing hella cash; seeing homeless people and vendors is heartbreaking. People need to assess and be thankful for their privilege.

I can't believe with all that power and influence, the family didn't speak up on behalf of their own flesh amd blood. I wish nothing but the best for them (H&M) and safe travels because Harry's massive balls and Meghan's heart of gold might exceed the weight limit on any aircraft.... Cheers to the real Royals."

fatlogic,fde7628,t3_ekwkpi,1578332666.0,Nobody cares that you're a fat pig. We care that you're pushing it as the new beauty standard and claiming it's healthy to be so fat you can't go up the stairs without getting winded.

fatlogic,fc9xws6,t1_fc9tpba,1577559850.0,Because you need water to survive. No one needs to binge or consume processed sugar to survive. Your analogy is weak af. Try again.
fatlogic,fc7t7dr,t1_fc7syiq,1577518011.0,Right? Try a week of under 50 carbs. Eat dark leafy greens and fish or other meats. Hmu when the withdrawals hit you.
