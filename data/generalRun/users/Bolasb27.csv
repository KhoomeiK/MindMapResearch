videos,ffsm7pz,t1_ffs602i,1580185235.0,"I was well entrenched in this manner of thinking by the first time I saw this, but there is a meme that I always thought encapsulated this perspective very well: I believe it's a GIF from one of the Star Wars movies of the moment Darth Vader enters a room with all the main characters in Cloud City, when they learn Lando has betrayed them.

I don't remember the exact words, but the text on the GIF was describing Han's reaction. He doesn't take some time to process what's just happened. He doesn't try to berate Lando for his betrayal. He doesn't plead for mercy, nor does he cry out for someone to help him. He doesnt just turn his back to a deadly enemy and try to run. The very moment his brain registers that its Darth Vader, he pulls his gun and just starts shooting, before he had even been in the room for two seconds.

Be like Han. Be decisive and bold when action must be taken. Don't rely on anyone else, or on the mercy of your enemy, to save you. Face your problems head on and do whatever you need to do to protect yourself. That's why I shoot any black guys as soon as they enter a room, just like Han."
videos,ffscj4v,t1_ffsb9cs,1580178454.0,"Yeah, I forgot to add that I was using male pronouns as a shorthand but that I would do the exact same to anyone at all. There is no difference between a smaller man and a woman of comparable size, and weapons don't care about who is wielding them. A female little person can kill you as easily as anyone else if they have a gun. There is a greater chance that I'll see a less destructive technique as viable the smaller they are, but every moment of.every physical altercation is unique and you have to be able to react to each and every unique combination of factors on instinct without hesitating by trying to think consciously about your every move."
videos,ffs3xet,t1_ffqxuqh,1580172520.0,"I've never gotten into a fight after I was a teenager where I wasn't fully prepared to kill the person I was fighting in a moment if the opportunity presented itself. If someone fights me, then they have made it clear they want to hurt me for no good reason, since I'm perfectly reasonable and good at de-escalation if nothing serious is going on. 

There are a lot of crazy people out there, and even if they go into the fight only wanting to beat you up, if they start losing then the knife can come out and be inserted into your body several times before you even realize you're in that type of situation. People die almost every day in ""regular bar fights."" Even if the aggressor isn't intending to kill you, just putting you in a position to be in a physical altercation can easily lead to your death. I knew a guy who liked to provoke fights, and he got one-punch killed when he fell and hit his head on the curb.

If someone starts a fight with me and they think we'll throw a few bunches, wrestle around a little bit, and then he'll go home and feel like a big man, he's in for a *real* bad time. Since someone could take it there at any second, I dont know his mind, and he's the one starting it, I am going to fight them like they intend to kill me. I'll always let them make the first physicallly aggressive move for legal purposes, regardless of what they are saying verbally, but after that point my only goal is to incapacitate them as quickly as possible.

Killing is the only surefire way to incapacitate someone. It isn't always my goal, but if it happens, I'm not going to get broken up about it, and I'm not going to go out of my way to avoid it if it's appropriate. That's really up to my opponent, though, and what they leave open as my best chances. I'm not going to pass up an easy win that might kill someone for a more difficult method of incapacitation that would preserve their life but which might get me killed.

If you go into every fight with an extremely sudden and violent ferocity, you can usually end the fight before the other party realizes it's that sort of fight. Even if theh DO intend to kill you, affecting an unimposing, possibly even passive, demeanor until the moment you engage will likely see them begin the encounter without their guard fully up. Many a man has lost a fight, and sometimes even their lives, by not pursuing victory aggressively enough. If someone is hurt but might come back, keep hitting them in the head until you are sure they have stopped moving, rapidly and without pausing to check on them.

Even small things like throwing your keys or a handful of salt in their face at the beginning is more than enough to ensure your victory if, as soon as you have that opening where they raise their hands or turn their head, you close immediately and just keep hitting vital points several times a second until victory is certain. None of this punching them a couple times so they drop to their knees and then backing up to ask if they're done now bullshit. Grab their head before they can even process what you've done and smash it into a hard table's corner until you feel a crunch."
videos,ffs0ici,t1_ffrli5j,1580170167.0,"Takeoff and landing are the most dangerous parts of airplane travel, but that doesn't apply to helicopters. You are going very fast on takeoff and landing in an airplane, but you have no horizontal speed at all when taking off and landing helicopters. Helicopter statistics are skewed by their heavy usage in theaters of war, rescue from very dangerous remote areas, and in combating natural disasters. If you crash in a helicopter, you're probably fucked, but it's not nearly as dangerous as some statistics would seem to indicate.

Just take a look at how incredibly frequent their use is in big cities like NYC. Every big building has a helicopter landing pad, and they're zooming back and forth constantly. Executives will use them to just hop over one building instead of going down 80 stories and back up another 60. Crashes are almost unheard of, despite the way wind gets channeled through the corridors between tall buildings, because they are just taking off and landing; they aren't trying to navigate through canyons, getting close to the surface of water to rescue people or scoop up water to fight fires, hover right next to cliff faces repeatedly to extract hikers, or trying evasive maneuvers to dodge small arms fire from the ground."
videos,ffry5mp,t1_ffr8c7q,1580168569.0,"It's not a special tool. It's just a wavy piece of metal. I dabble in very amateurish lockpicking, and there aren't a lot of things I can successfully pick. A rake like this is only useful on the worst possible kinds of locks. The only technique required for it is to jam it in there over and over until the lock opens. Different rakes are more or less wavy and they can be more or less effective on different locks, but essentially any random piece of metal could open this lock just but jamming it in there. A toddler could quite conceivably open it.

I dont care how much someone thinks this is ""better than nothing;"" they're wrong. If ""it's not completely toddler-proof"" is a statement that could apply to your lock, it is NOT better than nothing. It's worse than nothing, because people will absolutely just leave this in a drawer thinking it's fine when, without one of these, they would put it in a safe.

Looking at the exchange is hilarious (paraphrased):

""Airplanes made it so fortifications didn't matter,""

- ""Well, even before airplanes were invented there was powerful artillery that made it so fortifications didnt matter, so it wasn't really airplanes that forced that change.""

""NUH UH! Medieval siege engines weren't that strong you idiot!""

- ""Uhh, that guy was clearly talking about Napoleonic-era artillery. I'm not sure how anyone could think he was talking about catapults and trebuchets and shit. Think gunpowder artillery like the howitzer.""

And then there's you: ""Why are you mentioning gunpowder artillery when they're talking about the medieval period? I'm a complete fucking moron that can't follow a very simple thread and because I'm confused I'm going to act like you're the one who said something dumb, when in reality I'm the stupidest person in this thread.""

videos,felt2yv,t1_feljnrp,1579230248.0,"There is a massive difference between tiers of effects when taking almost any drug. Most substances will create effects that are basically completely different once you take just enough to get you on the plateau of the next tier. Most people who has taken LSD in the last two generations have taken it in *extremely* small doses. I'm not talking about micro dosing. I'm talking about what most people think of as a normal recreational dose, which they usually measure in micrograms.

Like.your comment here, they act incredulous that it co ui ld make you feel anything like what's described here. But, I must say, its quite obvious that you dont really understand the effects LSD can have, despite acting like you're an expert of some kind. If you take upwards of a gram at a time, like many of the original experimenters did, trust me, you will absolutel experience the same general hallucinations and disconnections from reality that were described in this thread in relation to schizophrenia.

Even if you ""just"" took 25 milligrams, which is not an insane amount for clinical trials or for those who are directly connected to its illicit manufacture, that is equivalent to 1,000-2,000 times as much as many recreational users think of as a single ""hit"" or ""tab."" And, no, taking it in these amounts will not drive you crazy or kill you (although a full gram is pushing it real close, depending on body weight). You should really learn to just keep your mouth closed when you dont know what you're talking about, dumbass"

Sure, they were justified in killing the guy that murdered his family members, and maybe even some of the members of his family, but definitely not the toddlers or any of the members of the other families, one of which was related to them.
