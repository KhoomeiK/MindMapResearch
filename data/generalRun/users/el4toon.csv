I am increasingly becoming aware of a term called bypassing.  Where we close the conversation to keep our own understanding of peace.  We say things like ""i hope you can let it go"" insinuating that I ought to feel different than I do.  

Colonial privilidge is a thing and since writing my first thoughts on a small event, I witnessed more in my community step forward in calling it out .  The patriarchal system will continue if unchallenged.  

If we do not see the effects of this, our ignorance only serves ourselves.   

I have spent most of my life enjoying seeing people without race.  It is a privilidge.  I am only beginning to understand.

My parent is an immigrant and were super harsh.  But i grew up and found out that they got it way harsher than I did and they did the best with the knowledge they had.

Swimming through microplastics and seeing tourist made garbage may spark a similar response in you too. 

I also do not support the cosmetic industry because they are breeding insecurity in young impressionable children, like a sweetheart I used to babysit.  She was so beautiful but could never see herself that way.  She grew up to have severe body dysmorphia and was convinced she was not lovable because she did not look like Britney Spears.  Her parents were super loving. it was the exposure from the media.  She found an exit while under suicide watch.  
So unnecessary.

Leading up to the call I could feel the familiar strain on my heart when I thought of him.  After a year of debillitating sadness I had to accept that I loved him and I loved someone who did not reciprocate. 

When he said the words he was sorry and thanks for all the work I put in.. I felt validated but dammit...still sad.  I was heartbroken I had let myself down by staying too long in the relationship.  I had lost trust in myself.
