PewdiepieSubmissions,fepcxt2,t1_fek4brz,1579317450.0,"It doesnt suck in my opinion. Free healthcare has saved my ass numerous times as i am a minor, and sometimes will need to see the doctor behind my parents back. (If youre over 16, you can legally go by yourself, and i have very anti-vaxx, anti-pharma type parents.) the tax is 2% and i’m pretty sure it isnt paid if youre not under medicare"
PewdiepieSubmissions,fep9tza,t1_fekq1a3,1579315370.0,"No, you do not need to pay the medicare levy tax if you do not own a medicare card.
Edit: i’m 90% sure"

AmItheAsshole,fejlrwm,t3_ep4c3n,1579179200.0,"NTA. Tokophobia is a very real and valid thing. I, myself have this phobia and can guarantee if i had to view such a thing i’d faint and become mentally scarred."
ihavesex,fejd4bg,t3_ep3uq6,1579168095.0,"Ah yes you can only be a ‘cool’ teenager if you have SEX! Way to pressure young girls into thinking they have to have sex in order to fit in. I hate this mindset, girls who aren’t truly ready will choose to do these things because they think they ‘have to’, and not because they truly want to."
AmItheAsshole,fefh2x2,t1_fee711w,1579056180.0,"Excuse me? Of course i wash my hands. How rude of you to suggest otherwise. Im lucky enough that my eczema isnt THAT bad however you have to sympathise and realise that eczema can get extremely severe and painful. I even suggested goats milk soap as an alternative to OP because thats what i use when my eczema gets really bad. I’m not defending uncleanliness, i simply just understand why he felt the need to do what he did in the first place."
steelseries,fefgseb,t1_fee7b2r,1579056004.0,I’ve had this headset for 2 years and only just started this issue. I dont have the instructions anymore
AmItheAsshole,fee2z6e,t3_eoley4,1579025320.0,Wish? Are you kidding me? You are suggesting her spend $50 on a WISH dress? Are you trying to ruin her wedding and make her feel ugly? What arrives from wish looks absolutely NOTHING like what it looks in the pictures. YTA.
AmItheAsshole,fee1mca,t1_fed967c,1579024510.0,Do you understand what eczema is or are you just ignoring that crucial part?
AmItheAsshole,fee1jol,t1_fed8jn7,1579024467.0,I feel as if your autoimmune disease justifies the disposable gloves. Its simply not the same as drinking from a straw when you could drink straight from the cup without anything bad happening to you. Its why paralysed people are not scolded for drinking out of plastic straws because its the only way they can drink
AmItheAsshole,fee17rc,t1_fedaulr,1579024265.0,"Because he wont have to use as much soap on his hands, and soap irritates eczema to excruciating pain. It’s an autoimmune disease and it’s not joke to the people who suffer it severely. I have a mild case and have to use goats milk soap when it’s inflamed otherwsie my hands become immobile."
AmItheAsshole,fee0rsj,t1_fedden9,1579023992.0,I think a severe medical condition warrants disposable gloves
AmItheAsshole,fee0o8o,t3_eok9zk,1579023930.0,"NTA. I feel like theres a better alternative, but as a fellow eczema sufferer i truly understand the pain. People being rude because your ‘hands are dirty’ literally dont understand that soap will make a severe eczema sufferer crack and bleed until that part of their body is absolutely immobile. It’s not fun. Id recommend using goats milk soap or any sort of soothing bar soap on your hands if you can, as well as steroid creams (i know there are risks, but it sounds like youre on the severe side).

However, if she’s your girlfriend and you live together id assume she has known you long enough to understand the severity of your autoimmune disease and should act a bit more maturely."

unpopularopinion,fedr7ix,t3_eog838,1579018145.0,"I used to enjoy this small-ish family channel (100k subs or so) and enjoyed their journey of having their newborn, but i absolutely lost it when they started talking in DEPTH about potty training once their kid was reaching toddler years. 

They would be extremely detailed about the child’s excrement (texture, how much would come out, etc) and what she would specifically do and it’s just ridiculous. These are up for everyone to see. If videos like that of me existed out in the internet i can very much confirm i would be tormented my entire life by everyone who stumbles upon it. (And the fact that hundreds of thousands of strangers know this information of you would make you so uneasy.)"
unpopularopinion,fedqi04,t1_fed58cz,1579017696.0,"I think helping out with a portion of your income is different to literally charging more than half of what you earn at 18 or even younger. Think about it: youre wasting away flipping burgers at bare minimum wage and your parents expect you to put in $150-200 a week when youre probably making $300 at most a week? Its just unfair. When you just turn 18, youre trying to get your life together and its unfair to not allow your kid to have some money to themselves to start creating some sort of foundation for their future."
