canada,ffioe55,t3_etubeq,1579978721.0,Kenney doesn't care because he'll ignore it and it won't be dealt with until there's a new government. The Conservatives will then complain about how much is being spent on cleaning up the mess.
movies,ffhhr5a,t1_ffg6r5c,1579935788.0,It sounds like they tossed out a much better script because of the backlash against TLJ.
ontario,ffheb1q,t1_ffgqsh7,1579931735.0,"Why do you want them to only get 1% so badly is a better question. Ford wastes millions of dollars but for some reason a standard 2% wage increase for teacher is the hill you want to die on. 

Do you know how much 1% is on $100,000? $1000, that's a whopping $84 a month before taxes. 

Why are you so against fellow Ontarians being treated fairly for the work that they do?"
ontario,ffgogzk,t1_ffgksl6,1579911044.0,"Yes, but why should it be the public sector that takes a hit. Just because the government is mismanaging things it doesn't mean we should be gunning for fellow Ontarians to get less than what's fair. People like you actively work against your neighbours when you show support for fiscal mismanagement by Doug Ford."
ontario,ffge9le,t1_ffgdmya,1579904293.0,"Yes that must be it. Every point you made, I've pretty much pointed out why it's incorrect or hypocritical. I'm not a teacher, but I'm also not stupid enough to fight against people's right to collective bargaining.

Your issue seems to be critical thinking. Seriously, if Ontario has a quarter of a billion dollars to tear down functioning wind farms, why would we not have $200  million over three years for education?"
ontario,ffgccp4,t1_ffg9aem,1579903104.0,The 1% raise was mandated by the government. No one agreed to it or accepted it.
ontario,ffg7dzf,t1_fffez64,1579900054.0,"Why do we never expect anyone but nurses and teachers to take one for the team? We can't afford to pay them, but we can afford raises for Ford's staff, and the addition of 16 new positions costing millions... Why is it okay to spend a quarter of a billion dollars tearing out functioning windmills but we can't give teachers a 2% raise?

The deficit excuse is garbage, because we don't seem to have a spending problem."
politics,fff7ocm,t1_fff4mwc,1579877781.0,"Yes, and look at how little thousand of the people who helped Bill build his empire made. How much better off are all the coders, quality people and others compared to Bill.

If the system wasn't rigged, we wouldn't need rich people to donate to their pet charities. We would all share in the success of the things we help build. Bill didn't do it all on his own."
politics,fff7fow,t1_fff5wy4,1579877615.0,"How much are roadies, people who work at the venues, people who work selling tickets, work in the industry doing IT work, etc. making in comparison to the people making millions. The mass of people who actually keep the industry making money, make next to nothing as a whole compared to the people at the top. 

It's the same with any industry. If people weren't forced to work to have the basic necessities, there's no way anyone is working a shit job, where they're threatened by their boss or made to work in an unsafe environment for minimum wage. No one is standing behind a counter taking abuse from customers and being paid next to nothing unless they have no other choice. 

The entire economic system is skewed in favour of the employer. Sure, we have some stat holidays and weekends but really, how can it not be considered wage slavery for most. Many people are forced to work 8+ hours a day in positions where they're abused verbally, and their health isn't a concern, all for food and shelter and still struggle for anything other than basic needs."
ontario,fff6bhw,t1_fferzwk,1579876820.0,"I'm not saying lower their salaries and I'm not demeaning their work. I'm comparing them to show that teachers face violence at work. Using the fact that other professions face violence isn't a reason to pay teachers less. 

Teaching requires more education and teachers are just as, or more likely to experience missed time injuries as police officers or firefighters. 

Your attitude that teachers are somehow below police officers and other public servants is the problem."
ontario,ffel5vp,t1_ffefuqs,1579852684.0,"Do you think special needs children are never violent, or teenagers? There are even instances of parents assaulting teachers. So, yes. I am comparing the assaults that teachers face to the assaults that police officers face."

The levels of stress, limited free time and so on eventually led to me developing severe depression and anxiety. I had to quit my job and have been living of savings for 6 months while trying to get my mental health under control.

The conservatives want to create two tier systems for education and healthcare. They want to under-fund the existing systems so they finally break under the stress. Then they'll introduce partial privatization all while critically under-funding the public option."
