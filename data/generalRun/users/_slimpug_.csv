happy,ffqwj6q,t1_ffqvneg,1580145249.0,"Because we have SOME Bubly in Canada but not those ones, so I figured you were from the land of unlimited grocery selection!"

stephenking,ffpm7tu,t3_eugkco,1580098529.0,Maybe it’s because I haven’t read the book yet but I am really enjoying the show!
houseplants,ffm95di,t1_fflz8oe,1580050772.0,"Same! Like the majority of my plants unfortunately. RIP and better luck to the next ones, I guess."
houseplants,ffk1ejl,t3_eu16dl,1580012851.0,I had one and loved it and then I got depressed and let it die.
happy,ffj46jf,t3_esnmkv,1579989945.0,You Americans get so many good flavours! What are the black and yellow tins?
MadeMeSmile,ffigswz,t1_ffi15hn,1579973522.0,Absofuckinlutely. Calling them “my bartender” gave me a chuckle. But the early part is the easy part; maintaining this and going to bars is the challenge. I personally can’t and I don’t know any other alcoholics who can.
konmari,ffi1bz5,t1_ffi0no0,1579962112.0,People hate being told the truth.

ACPocketCamp,fffikif,t1_fffhjzn,1579884732.0,Thank you so much! Me too!
fatlogic,ffcuab8,t1_ffaxy3o,1579807396.0,"What sort of gets me is that these are the same people who say be mindful of invisible illnesses. Which like, of course we should be - so did she just assume that this thin person is laying down because they're inconsiderate and not because she has some invisible chronic illness?"
insanepeoplefacebook,ffba2cf,t3_esolns,1579756888.0,"Way, way too common. And this is pretty tame."

xxfitness,ff80f5l,t3_es5x06,1579662751.0,I feel you! I broke my foot on Sunday night at the gym and I just want to work out.
DecidingToBeBetter,ff7z03l,t3_es5pga,1579661740.0,It could be so many things! Are you depressed? Whatâ€™s your nutrition like? Do you sleep well? Have you ever told a doctor?
ACPocketCamp,ff7n0st,t3_eno3d1,1579653447.0,"I have one too, if you want it!"
ACPocketCamp,ff5wmc2,t1_ff5k8bz,1579612706.0,"I love knowing there are other people out there who like Animal Crossing, Arrested Development, and Nirvana."
Death_By_SnuSnu,ff4t4ln,t1_ff470oj,1579571813.0,"Have you considered that NSFW is a catch-all term for anything you may not want the people surrounding you to see? For instance, Iâ€™m in the emergency room right now. Nothing to do with work. Iâ€™d like to scroll through my Reddit but would rather not flash a pussy to everyone around me."
AmItheAsshole,ff4lsih,t3_ermj3a,1579566704.0,"NTA. I almost donâ€™t believe this is real. I know free bleeding is a thing, but I have a hard time believing someone would do it at a gym. Blood borne illnesses are a thing."

ACPocketCamp,ff1wv0n,t1_ff1hhnu,1579488012.0,Also wondering. I want them!
fatlogic,fev59mf,t1_fev3qtr,1579393257.0,Same.
fatlogic,ferouwz,t1_feqke6m,1579356636.0,"Not everyone has problems with alcohol, itâ€™s true, but like someone commented itâ€™s not recommended you start drinking in any capacity if you donâ€™t already. The negative effects have been proven to outweigh any health benefits thought to have been gained. â€œPartyingâ€ on the other hand, to me, seems to be sort of synonymous than drinking your more than 4 drinks in a night and perhaps doing drugs. To each their own, though."
fatlogic,fermugd,t1_fepu688,1579355918.0,Iâ€™m a recovering problem drinker too. Iâ€™ve been free of binge drinking since July and I have no desire to return to that. Itâ€™s really not worth it! It fucks with every part of you. I could be depressed/feeling ill for an entire week after a binge and then do it all over again that weekend. So stupid.
DecidingToBeBetter,fepohc6,t1_fepmx9p,1579326091.0,Youâ€™re a douche
fatlogic,fepnqeh,t3_eqbzss,1579325445.0,"Also yes, I do abstain from drinking and partying because that shit is literal poison."

xxfitness,feiua22,t3_epbo8h,1579147387.0,Same thing happened to me. I went from working out at the YMCA to World Gym and holy fuck... fitness models and roids everywhere.
Instagramreality,fec244g,t1_febcdck,1578965531.0,"Oh okay, sorry! Thatâ€™s embarrassing, haha."
HydroHomies,feahmai,t3_eo6n2k,1578948892.0,We were only allowed Coke with dinner on weekends.

toastme,fdwepp7,t3_en6mkm,1578757949.0,Keep up the good work!

It really reminds me of her little area!"
ACPocketCamp,fdqzk8c,t3_emqe2s,1578677427.0,Reminds me of Cordelia from AHS.  : )
AntiVegan,fdlhou2,t1_fdlh7qh,1578524247.0,"No, I agree. It was obviously a joke because stopping people from going where they want to go is fundamentally wrong (and illegal). But processed food is disgusting and I wouldnâ€™t recommend anyone eat it if they have the choice."
AntiVegan,fdlewpl,t1_fdleupb,1578522544.0,"By not letting him eat poison. But it was a joke, clearly."
AntiVegan,fdkfc3t,t3_elsg8f,1578502671.0,Itâ€™s pretty fucked up but honestly theyâ€™re kinda doing you a favour.
Breakfast,fdhs5qy,t1_fdhhyln,1578429134.0,I feel like Iâ€™d be hungry in about ten minutes. Where the protein at?

EatCheapAndHealthy,fdghjcm,t1_fdelor9,1578397060.0,"You should YouTube the ads, theyâ€™re so good. â€œEggs for dinner isnâ€™t weird - youâ€™re weird for thinking itâ€™s weird!â€"
holdmyfries,fdejsyr,t1_fdejoz3,1578340532.0,And nice calves.
raisedbynarcissists,fddy4a7,t3_ejyrgy,1578326795.0,"My family is in law enforcement too and quite respected in our small community, so I donâ€™t think many people suspected how bad things were at home. 

Have you ever tried speaking to a professional about this? I wish I had something better to say but I found therapy really helped me cope with my childhood and I hate see you consider suicide, especially after seeing you in r/momforaminute. Youâ€™re a good person, OP."
fatlogic,fcut5p5,t1_fcuk1so,1577987996.0,I feel like we could definitely find middle ground on this topic. Itâ€™s obviously a bit of both - I donâ€™t think itâ€™s so black and white.
fatlogic,fcugcrt,t1_fcufyzi,1577980301.0,"Yep. It just bothers me because when you live in one of these communities and see people you care about having limbs amputated etc, itâ€™s hard to just accept fatness. I accept and love a lot of fat people but I donâ€™t want to accept that this is just the way it goes and this is totally normal and natural. The food weâ€™re eating is hurting us."
fatlogic,fcubar9,t3_eiy3y2,1577976968.0,"What bothers me is just the settling done by FA. Like yeah, obesity does effect some people more than others particularly along class lines, but why are we accepting that? Shouldnâ€™t we be so fucking mad that these huge corporations with their literal taste scientists and psychologists are trying to get us ADDICTED to shitty food that kills us? Where is the anger about that?"
xxfitness,fcsoyyk,t3_einwk9,1577921453.0,"Sober since July after years of problem drinking. Biggest tip (even though many of you probably arenâ€™t problem drinkers) would be to not place yourselves in situations where you normally drink. You should still see your friends, sure, but donâ€™t go over on a Saturday night while theyâ€™re drinking and expect to a) remain sober or b) have a fun time. Instead ask them to hang out during the day, and throw in a hobby or interest. Also, sparkling water."
AntiVegan,fcrobgi,t3_eil9t1,1577904435.0,Iâ€™m also curious! This is a really interesting perspective. I wonder if Lierre Keith has ever touched on it?
gratefuldead,fcoisq6,t3_ei7d58,1577833261.0,I love your style!
nostalgia,fcnjkje,t3_ehy9wa,1577812905.0,"The ones in London, Ontario still look like this."
HailCorporate,fck0iu9,t1_fciy482,1577712757.0,Iâ€™m disgusted by the wastefulness but also by their contribution to obesity in North America.

thingsforants,fcfwezh,t1_fccbres,1577634321.0,"Super helpful, thanks everyone!"
thingsforants,fcay57m,t3_egvr3w,1577578926.0,Howâ€™d you get started? Iâ€™ve always wanted to do this.
AntiVegan,fc071qw,t1_fbzy5m4,1577281330.0,"In all fairness, I was able to make some gains doing machines until I was confident enough to do free weights."
