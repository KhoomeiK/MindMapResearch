datingoverthirty,fdzy5s1,t3_endnlf,1578798675.0,"It seems like she has a much faster plan for emotional development/closeness than you. I don't think there's anything wrong with either except when she reacted to you being sick. I think this could be a bad time down the road. Silent treatment is manipulative and immature and likely not going to end there. 

As an emotional person I understand the need for attention/reassurance but not at the expense of someone else's space/independence. I think you handled it well. Be honest, be firm about your limits boss. You deserve someone who respects that."
