There's nothing wrong with how you feel, only you know what you need to feel and no one should tell you you're wrong for feeling the hurt and anger you feel for the abuse you (and not them) suffered. I don't talk to my dad anymore and I feel lighter and freer because of it  I know he's sad and mad about it, but I have permanent damage from him. And that's not okay. That's like the people that would tell me the same thing about my rapist. Let it go, forgive because that's the only way you can move on. No. Fuck them for saying that. Fuck them a thousand times to hell for never being raped and telling me that like they know better. No one should be forgiven for what you and I went through."

We get involved in everything and everyone, probably too much. But either way, you are family, her nephew/niece and your grandmother's grandchild. It breaks my heart to think they are treating you like this, either by bullying or being passive and letting it happen. She should be proud that you are in school, furthering your education and working hard. Going to school full time and working is hard, I've done it-it puts a strain on everything. And you shouldn't be treated like a boarding guest, god, how awful. I hope you get to leave soon, I'm glad you are just visiting and it isn't a permanent thing.
