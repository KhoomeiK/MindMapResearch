Once I turned 18 my dad said to me 'you're a man now, I can't tell or make you do anything but I'd like to think I have raised you well enough to know right from wrong and treat this house with respect' and for the most part me and my brothers did.

Thing is, it was easy to respect my parents and the rules they put in place because they were reasonable and justified. It's only the past few years I've really noticed how awesome my parents are, I'm gonna call my dad and tell him I love him."
