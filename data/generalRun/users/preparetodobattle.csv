There have in the past been houses and lives lost when planned burns get out of control.  So you need to be careful. We’ve done as much as we can.  The Victorian government has been upfront that they would like to have done more but weather hasn’t permitted it.  Fire season usually lasts a month or two. It’s changing to be as long as six months. These are areas that are designed to burn from time to time. The smoke and flames are necessary to germinate some plants.
