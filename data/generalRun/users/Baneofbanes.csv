imaginarymaps,fffmyvv,t1_fffmbxg,1579887438.0,">This is a timeline where the US hasn't held this land for decades though,

So the 80 years between the revolution and the ACW don’t count?

 >and it seems as if the destruction is on a level well beyond the OTL Civil War. Why would the US see any reason to annex the land? Its poor and war-torn, a lot of it is predominantly black, and theres a generation on both sides that have grown up separated and see themselves as distinct.

If for nothing else, than strategic purposes.

Texas has major oil reserves which irl will be discovered soon. The red state in Louisiana and Arkansas hold control over the Mississippi River, which is the economic heart of most of the Central Untied States.

This is also thousands of miles of militarized borders for weak states that can be influenced by hostile foreign powers which can strike right into the heart of the American nation, not to mention all the harbors they can allow access to forgiven navies, defeating one of the US’s most important strategic assets, the two oceans that separate it from any other power. 

And I doubt that the Union side seems them as distinct, but rather as traitors and separatists who should be bright back into the fold. And the best time to do that is when they are weak. 

And they already annexed most of the Upland south which even by Southern standards is poor, so why not the rest, the actual important parts of the south?

Poor or not it’s in the US’ best interests to swallow them back up."
