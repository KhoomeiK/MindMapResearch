AskReddit,ffyowtw,t1_ffy2v18,1580351587.0,"Watch cat videos first, and old vine cimpilations. Then start like doing the dishes, or playing music. Start leaving the house and listen to audio books,  go shopping.  Start learning new things researching,  maybe start learning a language you always wanted to, but don't tell anyone. Then start practicing lucid dreaming. Then start writing, a novel. Then pick up a new hobby or skill like juggling or staff spinning. Eventually start meditating and drinking alot more water during all of this."

WTF,ffm8it1,t1_ffm4zbd,1580050344.0,"My understanding is that it would be blursed if the masks were made in a facility, in china. The workers at said facility could have the virus themselves knowingly, or unknowingly.  They would then inadvertently pass the virus into the masks,  which would then ship workdwide. If the virus lived long enough in the packaged masks, it could make it to your doorstep in America with the Coronavirus intact, and begin a new outbreak all due to the paranoia you had when you bought the mask. I think."
