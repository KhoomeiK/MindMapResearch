Supplements,ffcanx3,t3_esszfd,1579795330.0,"Sorry, I can only share what my search is... no expert advice here. However, my husband and I are very interested in something we recently learned about... listening to 40 hz sound waves as a way to ""clean"" the brain.  You can find some interesting TED talks, as well as videos  ( I think my husband finds these on Amazon). We've been experimenting. I just ordered a set of ear buds that gets good bass in order to listen to the tones. We found that some of our cheap ear buds don't even transmit the 40 hz sound at all. Also it comes through better through our tablet than through our phones when we plug the earbuds in (listening to the Youtube 40 hz videos). Anyway, they've done some experiments with people listening eveyday and finding some improvements in brain function.

Regarding supplements, we've experimented with phosphatidylserine, vinpocetine, gingko biloba. He takes all of these... not in huge doses. I stopped because... it's a long story, but I'm small and sensitive and didn't like some of the effects."

I can still drink it... but I have actually switched to a coffee substitute with a caffeine pill added.  My strategy is to avoid the acidifying effect on urinary tract which used to make me feel as if I had to pee all the time. My ""coffee"" is Cafix crystals with caffeine pill added. I think I must consume about 250 mg caffeine a day. Morning drink as described above. Midmorning: 1 capsule of Genius Caffeine slow release caffeine. Late afternoon: about 1/2 cup of drink described above. I do find that drinking a certain amount of caffeine actually reduces anxiety for me.

Recently (a few days ago) I began experimenting with low dose of GABA. So far its really helped to sooth nerves. I still believe it's important to deal with mental causes /triggers (counseling or meditation for example).

Regarding migraines, I stopped having them when I no longer menstruated. They perhaps were triggered by the constant change of hormones in my body."

I've read that Stevia lowers blood pressure and I know that my blood pressure tends to run lower than most people's. Not a conclusive proof of anything, but something you could try. Be sure to use real stevia if  you want to try this. For some reason the FDA allows companies to use the label ""Stevia"" when the main ingredient is erythritol and stevia is just a fraction of it. Not that there's anything wrong with erythritol... but it's Stevia that (supposedly) lowers blood pressure."

UkrainianConflict,fe2luvd,t1_fdytjzf,1578840203.0,"I doubt it. That's not the way psychology works. They (the Russians) are cut off from the rest of the world by their language and...Pride. They feel they do not get the international recognition they deserve from their long and interesting history.  The day may come when they will recognize that being great depends more on the willingness to be part of the family of nations, and they will no longer be willing to have their worst fear instincts played by Putinesque leaders. To a lesser degree we are struggling in the US with groups of our population being played in the same way by groups seeking power. These groups are culturally isolated from the mainstream, are often in the South, and fear change will hurt them. There are TV and radio stations playing these people the same way that Putin plays the Russians.

I explained to my husband that I did not want him to even take nude pics of me because it's too dangerous. I am not blaming the victim. I just think that looking back on times when I behaved in certain ways, I wish I had had someone older I trusted to explain why this behavior (which ended up causing me various kinds of unpleasant effects) would not be a good idea. I did not have that person in my life. So even if I get downvoted a lot for saying this, you might want to consider learning how to take care of yourself, even if everybody else isn't doing it. In the meantime, yes, he was very, very wrong to do this and you have done well to get rid of him.

Can't advise you about the dose... my husband takes about twice as much as I do, but he only takes it in the morning, I believe. I suggest starting with these three, establish a borderline, then decide whether to try the others. 

Husband had a bad experience with Ashwaganda. Be careful about dosage if you decide to try it.
