dogs,ff6wlf2,t3_erp341,1579636381.0,Attention to the owner. Nothing else works without it!
dogs,feohrrt,t1_fen8zqe,1579300411.0,I have never heard of a true service dog “recoiling and whining” if someone tried to pet it.
dogs,fefnh0a,t3_eovk3i,1579060172.0,I’m hyper vigilant and have heard some snarky comments here and there. Don’t care. My priority is an obedient dog who is safe. To achieve that requires attention!
dogs,feejehn,t3_eo5tdp,1579034955.0,"Ah, yes, the people who ask for your advice with no intention of taking it....

Good of you to point her in the right direction, although a reputable RR or Great Dane breeder will probably show her the door. Then she’ll find a backyard breeder who will give her a ??? dog and that’s a nice mess.  I’m sure she’ll be back for more advice she won’t take!"
dogs,fe6hhco,t3_entszb,1578891040.0,"Positive reinforcement doesn’t work if the bad behavior is more reinforcing than the owner’s reward. I am totally about positive reinforcement and I believe it should be the primary mode of training. However, I have encountered a few situations where I have had to use a prong collar (under the direction of a skilled trainer). In certain situations (training classes especially) my dog would get super excited and be pulling like crazy on the leash. It would be very challenging to get her attention, and when you did, it would be only long enough to get the treat and then right back to pulling. It was a yo-yo effect. Once I employed corrections, this behavior stopped. Now, positive reinforcement can be employed and sustain her attention.  But sometimes a correction is required if a dog knows what to do, and is just blowing you off."
dogs,fdyed6c,t3_en8fej,1578778841.0,"The obedience clause is pretty standard, and actually, not that strict! My breeder “required” much more training and a lot sooner. I say “required” because, as others have said, it isn’t enforceable if you are the owner. 

This contract sounds like a list of preferences. They may just be trying to separate dedicated owners from the lazy ones. I would certainly query about the diet clause, as this could be an issue the day you pick up the puppy. For example, I’d never agree to feed a raw diet. So, if you don’t agree with the diet...what do you do for dinner? You can’t just switch a puppy food in an instant, or you risk gastrointestinal upset. Plus, you could have to switch the diet down the road for a myriad of reasons. Thus, you need to be in control of the food choice. Talk to the breeder about it.

I’d tell the breeder that you agree with the principles of the contract (e.g,. Take good care of your dog) but have some concerns about the specifics. Again, the breeder may be inviting such a discussion. They probably just want a dedicated owner."
dogs,fdnvtxu,t1_fdnqz8h,1578593876.0,Dogs sleep on the floor happily...they’re fine!
dogs,fdnvraa,t3_emcu39,1578593833.0,"Leave the crate empty, especially of things that could be ingested. It may or may not be lack of exercise...even a well exercised dog can get a bad idea sometimes."
dogs,fdnvjyn,t3_emaoq8,1578593714.0,"One dog, two crates over here....and I’d happily buy another one! I don’t know how people raise dogs without a crate."
dogs,fdl7lvw,t3_elvk51,1578518414.0,"7 months old? I have never heard of a puppy that has passed certifications for therapy dog work (e.g. Therapy Dog International). So, this is just a teacher bringing their dog to work...but I digress. In general, a REAL therapy dog can be helpful in various settings (schools, library programs, senior homes etc) but there are parameters. The dog should not be overwhelmed because they have been trained not to be...that’s why they have certification tests."
dogs,fdhpw2j,t3_elfyyn,1578427812.0,"Dog parks are very tricky and I am wary of them...and I say that as someone who takes my dog to a particular dog park every day. I go at a particular time (early in the morning), there are regulars and I know almost every dog who frequents it. When a new dog shows up, I’m on high alert. If I see any thing about a dog - or owner! - that I don’t like, I leash up and leave immediately.  If you are going to use dog parks, you have to scout around to find one that works for your dog, and what time it works at. If the park is close to you, monitor it at few times a day. There are usually peaks and troughs in traffic. 

If your dog is shaking, just leave.  Not worth it. Ask your friend to meet you at the park at “low traffic” times and try then. But your dog may not enjoy the dog park and that’s okay - they can live without it."
dogs,fde7oxn,t1_fde4g3k,1578332991.0,"“Ballyhoo” is a beautiful dog and looked very familiar...and it appears he shares a great-great grandfather with my dog! 

It seems OP is doing their research but just to add to this thread, when interviewing breeders, be really clear about what you’d like the dog to do (and not do). For example, my Golden would never make it in field work - lol! Too lazy, took her 1.5 years to develop ball drive. But that’s great...we’re a companion home. The Golden community in our area educated us and steered us away from high drive dogs."

“Sleep when the baby sleeps.”
“First year of marriage is the hardest.”
“When you’re not looking, that’s when you’ll find it.”"
dogs,fcyqavj,t3_eiegr4,1578084892.0,"Please consider crate training ASAP. It provides a strong signal to a dog that it’s chill out time. There are tons of crate training posts on this sub. Introduce it properly, associate it with great things, and cover it with a blanket when you expect the dog to chill out. 

Go to puppy classes and learn basic obedience skills and games (e.g, sit, down, name recognition/attention). Start teaching the dog to focus on you right now. It’s the most valuable thing and there is a lot of fun ways to teach it. 

Lastly, structure. Put the dog on a schedule. There is a time to eat, to play, and to chill. The owner chooses these times, and dog learns to adapt."
dogs,fco0oe6,t3_ei1yw2,1577821974.0,"This is a very interesting study, thanks for posting. I’m not a very seasoned owner, but the results of this study confirm what seems very obvious to me. Different breeds behave differently. It defies common sense to suggest “it’s all how you raise them.” If that was the case, why are most guide dogs Labrador Retrievers? And would any Navy Seal bring my Golden Retriever to their Bin Laden raid?!! Nope. You could train her round the clock for years but she’s never going to be a Malinois. She will, however, try to make friends with a terrorist - no training required."

dogs,fckxnqr,t3_egagg0,1577735402.0,"My 19 month old Golden has FINALLY become interested in playing fetch! We’ve been throwing a ball for 1.5 years and maybe getting one or two retrieves, before she’d wander off to sniff the ground or find a stick. Then, a few days ago, I took out a Chuck-It whistle ball and bam! She’s retrieving it and is super pumped about it. I’m in shock - I never thought I’d see ball drive."
dogs,fci3b1b,t3_eh4web,1577657255.0,We used a diffuser in the kitchen once and my dog was reverse sneezing. I think it was lavender - not toxic - but dogs don’t seem to like that stuff.
dogs,fb6s5w3,t3_ebqtqe,1576558617.0,"It’s expensive. A dog walker could be 20-40 bucks/day, depending where you live. Food can get pricey if your dog needs a special type (e.g. hypoallergenic). Could be up to 80-100/month. 

The real cost is veterinary care. If your dog gets sick (they will) or injured (really hope not) it’s hundreds and maybe thousands. If you get pet insurance, could be 60-80/month. And it doesn’t cover everything. 

A dog is very time consuming, as well. If you work 8-10 hrs/day, a puppy is going to be a big challenge. They’d need to be let out every 2-3hrs, and that assumes they aren’t sick or struggling with house-training. 

Dogs can be fun, but they are a major responsibility in terms of time and money. And it isn’t fun when they are sick or having a behavioral issue."
