selfimprovement,ffcv7ux,t1_ffcm7t9,1579807948.0,"Our situation is no different. We agreed that once a week, at least, we do something to us. Of course sometimes we can't, but we try. 

My tip is: try leaving your daughters with someone you trust and take your wife out, have a beer or eat something or even see Netflix. Children related matters are not allowed. Only you."

I don't want you to think I don't like Brazil. This is a very good place, the people are great and kind. But when we need government help, such as security, health care or education (sometimes), we seem to be alone. This is what arouses my desire to change."
CasualConversation,fejjjp1,t1_fej0zs6,1579176928.0,"I totally agree with you. But when you have a child, that decision has become a little more difficult, this life is up to you.

On the other hand, experiences are the only things we take from here, so I believe that if your decision does not directly impact another's life, go to the world! :D"
