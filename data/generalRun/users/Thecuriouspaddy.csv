Ultimately though my brother it comes down to this. 
If you are meant to be, nothing will happen. 
If it happens, you were never meant to be.

I think the undisputable GOAT of the game is Jon Jones for pure fighting ability. Unfortunately his activities outside of the octagon and failed drug tests makes it very tough to give it to him. 

Ok number 1 can't have it , who's number 2 ? 
For me it's DC. Murdered everybody bar Jones in LHW , starched Miocic for the 1st and a good majority of the 2nd fight until Miocic beautifully cut him down with body shots. Great guy, great character. Respectful and well spoken. An Olympian, not to mention what he has overcome in his personal life along with being a champion. 

He's not the goat but a special mention to the legend that is Michael Bisping. He's my favourite fighter.  I never thought as a full bred passionate Irish man I'd be an avid supporter of an English man over one of my own (only McGregor at the minute I'm afraid)"

Benzo numbed everything which was great at the time but I'm a very highly stimulated person so being dumbed down doesn't suit me so I left it, but I saw how people could get hooked easy.

With coke, I Saw the danger straight away and I have never gone near it since. People don't see the danger because they think the danger is a bad reaction , a shit high. The danger is the fact that getting high on coke is practically eliminating any self-esteem or self-confidence issues and making you feel like you are THE MAN. 

I've improved in my self confidence and esteem since then but at the time, coke gave me this confidence that I've never had before in my life. I was talking to girls like I was born to do it and ended up sleeping with one THAT WAS WAYYYY OUT OF MY LEAGUE. Not in my wildest dreams did I ever think a girl like that would even consider me as a fling. That was just the girl I slept with , three or four fantastic  women were flirting with me that night. It was crazy. 

I woke up the next morning, frightened. Frightened like fuck. 
This drug gave me a licence to feel good in myself , bypass the problems that i had and to have a good time. Finally let go of all the leashes and things that were holding me back to go and show people who I really am, not the social anxiety, over thinking , nervous me. 

It was then I knew that this drug could f***** have me around it's pinky finger. I knew I was in danger already. The lads all texting me, telling me how much fun I was, that it was great seeing me let the hair down for once and poking fun at the ""worldie"" I had pulled (their words, not mine). I wasn't just a tag along anymore , I was one of the boys now and a respected one too. 

This is what I had dreamed about for years. Respected by the lads and getting flirted with by chicks. I was very out of shape for most of my life and got hammered about it by the boys constantly. The last 3 years I changed my life and became fairly ripped/jacked. I had gone out on endless nights before this and suffered with my own self-destruction. It reeks, no self esteem. I never felt I fitter in and no success with the ladies. I thought it the dream was over. I was as jacked as I was gonna get and I felt that I couldn't get over my own issues. Then cocaine gave me what I dreamed of and I can't emphasize that enough . 

On one side I was dealing with the best night of my life, the other side I was dealing with the fact I had taken a drug to have it. 

I knew it pal , this was the junction in the road. It was either I go down this road and becoming addicted to silencing my inner issues and critics or go the other road, and build that self esteem and confidence naturally to those levels so I can live the life , without cocaine. 

I haven't had sex since and it's been a fair while. I've been determined to get myself to a place where I can have fun and feel a secure as I can , without the drug.

The hurt caused by a soulmate's infedility is so destructive it is beyond comprehension. It's a violation of everything by somebody that we hold very, very close. 

First off , 30 ? Too old ?! There is plenty of men, the vast majority actually that would only love to have a lady that's 30 or over. I've been told that actually when they are at their best! Trust me, he is far from your only option. 

Btw you are not a doormat. It's not easy to drop a relationship at the click of your fingers, especially when you are in love. Love blinds our greatest judgement and everybody can be guilty of that.

The dreams arent easy. In my experience they ease over time. I had nightly reminders of my partners infedility but eventually they fade away . I'd say it was approx a year when I felt comfortable falling asleep again. 

You will be able to watch movies again, HELL , you'll be able to watch movies with infedility on the storyline without relating it back. I only noticed this recently when I was watching a rerun of a suits season ( Rachel cheated on Mike , absolutely raging) and it was only after a span of a few episodes I realized that I didn't get any anxiety about it at all. I didn't relate it to me or to my previous relationshop, which was pretty cool. At the beginning anything would trigger a reminder , now I've to remind myself I got through it !

Recovery from this type of thing takes time. You have been through quite alot in the last 6-8 weeks. Not only infedility, but losing a partner and experience the aftermath of a miscarriage. 

I believe recovery is consistently happening everyday. 
Each day goes by, we become better at handling and accepting the past. 

There'll be days where you feel you've got this under control and you will be ok , others it feels like you got hit with it all just yesterday. 

Some days will be better from others but bear in mind, we become better at managing as we go along. We begin to live our lives with the hurt and conserve time to grieve.
