neoliberal,ffiqx6v,t1_ffhe297,1579980484.0,">Bernie's scumbag past

What scumbag past? Bernie has been remarkably consistent in his career and has been on the right side of history for virtually every issue. Meanwhile, there is video of Biden saying he tried to prostitute himself to wealthy donors, and has been on the wrong side of history for many important issues like LGBT rights, wars, civil rights, etc. Voters (left and right) are sick of corporate corruption in politics, and Biden will get destroyed by Trump with videos like this https://youtu.be/oysFCNPg0DA The only thing the right can do to attack Bernie is to hyperbolically call him a communist, and guess what? They will do the same thing to any Democratic candidate. 

>There is no way his current level of support with independents remains that high once all his dirty laundry is out in the open. 

It will increase. The more Bernie is attached over non-policy related issue (generally by lying quite transparently) by the MSM, the more support he will get from independents. There was no shortage of TRUE character flaws of Trump to attack, but apparently independents didn't care much for them because Trump gave a very leftist populist message of ""I will bring your jobs back and I will end the wars"".

>Nobody has seriously attacked Bernie the same way every other candidate is attacked, when that happens, his campaign will crater.

To the extent that statement is true, it's because they can't. Bernie's record is too clean. I'm not saying it's perfect, but it's far far better than anyone else in the race. Meanwhile, even though Biden has been attacked, it's been done using kids gloves. The primary candidates are too nice to show you the video I posted above and there are many more like it."

If we keep pushing the status quo, sooner or later we will get a demagogue that isn't a complete idiot. We need to fix the problems in our society, not let them fester.

>I'm sick of this divisiveness, and don't want to vote for an unrelentingly angry candidate with a destructive, negative message.

And yet you support Biden? Biden's whole message is ""I won't push for any of the things you want, but at least I'm not Trump."" It's extremely negative. He is a part of the establishment who's strategy is to shame people into falling in line. That's not unity, it's extortion. Bernie on the other hand does have a message of unity. His campaign is dedicated to the issues that have overwhelming public support. He brings people together from across the political spectrum because he focuses on policy that people care about.

Not really. The progressive view, the view of the majority of the people from which you think legitimate authority is derived, is that current immigration laws are unjust. We don't want open boarders, we want legal immigration to be easier for people who aren't violent criminals. The right, or at least Republican party leadership, wants legal immigration to be virtually impossible for people who aren't white or rich. The corporations that love immigrant labor and own the Republican (and Dem) party don't want to pay even minimum wage, which they can get away with for migrant workers.

Well let's do the math then. Iran:  Sends top general on peace mission. US: Kills general as an illegal act of war in an allies territory without their consent and simultaneously killing allied Iraqis. -1 < 1, yes?
In response. Iran: Threatens to bomb ~30 targets. US: Threatens to bomb 52 targets. 30 < 52, yes?
And while we are at it, lets count the number of times US has overthrown a democratically elected government in Iran: 1. Number of times Iran has overthrown US government 0. 0 < 1?
Number of American civilians killed by Iran or proxies: 0. Number of Iranian civilians killed by US or proxies: thousands. 0 < thousands?
Any way you want to look at this you find the US is the greater aggressor who is always escalating things. Iran is defending itself and the US is a foreign invader trying to control their natural resources.

>Which is de-escalation, and if you disagree all you have to do is wait to see that you're wrong.

Even if Trump's crimes don't trigger all out war, you can be sure there will be increased deaths on both sides under the same warfare that is already taking place. Hatred for America in Iran and Iraq is probably the highest its been since the US invaded those countries."

It's an escalation over Iran's response. And it's blatantly inciting war, which is an escalation. 

>I answered de-escalation.

And that is only True if Iran de escalated because Trump is escalating the situation. Responding with greater threats is escalation. How do you not understand this?"

PoliticalDiscussion,fdlxy82,t1_fdlxgl6,1578535154.0,Solimani was literally on a peace talk mission. That is de escalation. Then Trump assassinated him. Then Iran threatened to bomb like 30 targets. Then Trump threatened to bomb 52 targets. You are too dumb for this conversation.
