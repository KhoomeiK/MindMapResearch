PHitness,fe8gj9x,t1_fe7w509,1578925906.0,And how long have you been doing it? There's a lot more to it than going in a caloric deficit but the bottomline is consistency and progression. Be consistent in going to the gym. Be consistent in avoiding sugary and junk food. Be consistent in eating healthy. Progress through your workouts by aiming to lift heavier every week and whatnot. There's this misconception that doing a lot of cardio helps you lose fat faster. To some degree yes but a lot others is at play as well. Always track your progress. I'm 5'9 and 82kg with ~15% body fat. I was the same weight but had 25% body fat last July. I didn't see any visible result til after 3 months. Just be consistent.

phinvest,fdgs26o,t1_fdgrvje,1578406862.0,So the answer is you can't utilize it without actually spending. One workaround is ask around your friends or family if they are planning on buying something and ask for their receipts instead.
phinvest,fdgrvje,t3_elc0ks,1578406724.0,Only beneficial if you have a big salary hence pay a lot of tax and if you actually have planned a big purchase. Don't buy something just to avail of the tax shield. It still only covers a portion of your salary as 'tax free' which would probably just save you a few hundred to a few thousand monthly depending on your salary.
phinvest,fdgk6uf,t3_elac3n,1578400041.0,"Here are my priorities when choosing a job.
1. Growth
Personal growth always is a first for me. Do I get to learn more things? Will it help me grow as a person? Etc.
2. Salary
Salary comes second of course. Enough said.
3. Location
Location doesn't matter for me since I'm from the province. I could just rent a place that's walking distance from my work. (Which I'm currently doing)"
PHitness,fde9n91,t3_ekwneo,1578334226.0,Meal prep. Cooking your own food is the way to go. Whole foods. Easier to count the calories with. Every new recipe I usually try to calculate everything but once you've cooked/prepared it a couple of times you should already be familiar with the calorie count and macros. Buy a kitchen scale. I use myfitnesspal as well. But I rarely use those anymore. I just eyeball everything now lol.
