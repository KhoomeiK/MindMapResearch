news,ffkwvyl,t1_ffkg2h7,1580030458.0,"A lot of this quite clearly depends on the setup of stroke assessment in your locality. 

We are moving towards rapid access stroke teams in many countries. At my local hospital stroke suspects go straight past ED, they're not even seen by ED clinicians, they go straight to CT and then get assessed by a stroke physician and then the decision whether or not to thrombolyse is made. Indeed the final decision often comes down to the consultant (attending) stroke physician and not even the registrar (resident). 

I fully support this move because diagnosing stroke isn't as simple as one may think. There are a lot of stroke mimics and thrombolysing those is dangerous because you afford them only risk, no benefit. 

ED can diagnose, they can thrombolyse, but with the services we have available for high risk things we are moving towards direct multidisciplinary team assessment rather than going through a middle man who may not have as much expertise."
news,ffkw6i6,t1_ffk5hj5,1580030108.0,"If you were unwell enough it is entirely possible that paracetamol wouldn't, alone, treat your fever. Also some people don't take it properly. They just take it here and there and only one tablet. For an adult over 50kg the best way to stay feverless is to take 2 tablets (1g) four times a day (4-6 hours apart). If that alone isn't enough, you can take 2 ibuprofen at the same time as the paracetamol (400mg 4 times a day). They will work better together than individually. 

I have only ever been sick enough once where even that wasn't quite enough to treat the fever and needed antibiotics and other medications to help. 

The point being, just because you had an experience where it once didn't work well, doesn't mean that the medication doesn't work overall. It demonstrably does."

Of course there are bad doctors and those in it for the wrong reasons. But anyone who's ever worked alongside doctors knows that the vast majority of them are caring individuals. Are they well compensated for it? Yes. Does that make them bad people? No. You can have good intentions and want to help people *and* be happy with the remuneration you're receiving for the job. 

People make the same argument about lawyers, yes, but only the demonised corporate lawyers working on behalf of Texaco or Enron, or whoever. There's a reason public defenders who are paid very little are thought of as David rather than Goliath.

Not all lawyers are bad, not all doctors are greedy monsters who flinch at having to help patients.

You argue exorbitant costs are ok in human medicine because people will pay for it, because they want to live. Yet your own country is example for how this is absolutely not the case. The US has one of the highest rates of healthcare inequality in the developed world. And people can and do choose to decline life saving surgery (and medications) because they are unable to afford them.

America's choice to have healthcare beholden to the insurance agencies is the fault of your politicians, not the doctors who overall have altruistic intentions. God forbid they make a decent salary to recoup the over $250,000 debt the average US medical graduate has to deal with. 

Let me give you my perspective, from someone who lives in a country with universal healthcare that doesn't pay anything directly, but has had to pay £££ for pet healthcare. Yes, the cost to deal with my pet is far lower than what humans deal with in America, but I have had my vets do things that may not have been totally necessary because they got to whip out a cool endoscope and of course they charged my pet insurance for they procedure. Or the other tests they suggested they should run, etc, etc. 

Except, I'm not a vet, I have little basis with which to question their judgment. Whether or not it was justified I've no idea, but the idea that because it's less costly than human medicine doesn't mean there can't be a perverse incentive to over investigate in veterinary medicine is just silly. The difference is it's not a million dollars for an organ replacement, its doing multiple biopsies or investigations under general anaesthesia, or testing the cool toys for a problem that can be conservatively managed, etc. It may be orders of magnitude less money, but it's still money nonetheless."
