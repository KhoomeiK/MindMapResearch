AmITheAngel,ffkoovw,t3_eu3anj,1580026249.0,Was about to post this too.  Jesus freaking christ. Seriously?!
doggrooming,ffehr5q,t1_ff20g0z,1579848499.0,"I only like yorkies because I grew up with one and fell into owning one, so I'm nuts and love them. Haha.  Grooming them is definitely difficult.  They aren't the easiest breed to groom, and their hair is so freaking difficult to work with."
doggrooming,ffehlcz,t1_fezhhed,1579848317.0,Thanks!
doggrooming,ffehjaf,t1_feyz126,1579848252.0,"They were surprisingly really great, considering! Totally different hair types and one need a haircut and the other just needed a face, feet, fanny."
doggrooming,ffeh39h,t1_ff3155v,1579847747.0,"Haha, I have a 6 lb yorkie and he's the WORST! These three were actually better than he is for grooming."
TwoXChromosomes,feylt9h,t1_fex6uzc,1579447320.0,"This mindset is also NOT okay. If we react this way  toward anyone that has a change of perspective then it won't freaking help anything. 

Yes, it's only one person, but if we react this way to all of them what kind of outcome do you then expect? 

I'm so incredibly frustrated by everyones reactions to this."
LadyBoners,fexz87u,t3_eqvu9o,1579438660.0,"Before posting, I searched the sub and only found a few young Hemingway posts. I kind of prefer him older. Hope others on here do too!"
TrueCrime,fextakj,t1_fesbew7,1579435664.0,"You've commented that a few times, but to my understanding of the news so far and the video, he put the kid up to the window. Are there reports on him dangling her?

Either way, it shows negligence on the grandfather's part, and shows that he lied about not knowing the window was open. 

Obviously I can't say for certain, but think at this time that u/jbetty567 is correct with their previous comment. They say it a lot better than I could.

Edit: minus gross before negligence, because (I think) that's a different area."
TwoXChromosomes,fexmmsu,t3_eqphay,1579433316.0,"I'm sorry, but the comments on this post, especially the most popular, are really upsetting me. 

So many are really judging and being hard on the OP for previously being pro life. 

I know that pro choice has to fight for that right, but this one OP is not our enemy.

She shared something on here and I commend her for it.  Yes, it's not the post this sub usually sees, but it was something that happened in her life and she chose to share it on here.  This collaboration of negativity towards one person who has changed their perspective is not okay."
TwoXChromosomes,fexesz4,t1_fewyjgd,1579429823.0,"Can you explain what you mean by a ""fuck you, I got mine"" attitude coming from the OP, or just in general, because I'm not really understanding that part of this comment at all... 

No, this isn't a heartwarming story, but pretty much telling the OP that she's a shitty person most definitely isn't the correct answer either."
TrueCrime,fert09n,t1_fersuo7,1579358054.0,"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/granddad-toddler-who-died-cruise-ship-fall-knew-window-was-n1117796

I can't really notice it either, but apparently he leans out the window before putting her up to it."
TrueCrime,fers6z4,t1_fer26sf,1579357768.0,It's not intentional now. The video just proves that he knew the window was open.
TrueCrime,fers07x,t3_eqeyuc,1579357697.0,"That's really kind of a click bait-ish title. The video only proves that he knew the window was open.

The article if anyone wants it: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/granddad-toddler-who-died-cruise-ship-fall-knew-window-was-n1117796"
beagle,feiemwv,t1_fe2fjbh,1579136730.0,"No offense meant! By spoiling, I guess I meant more not controlling the weight gain with proper healthy care. 

Can eat like a horse and still be healthy, but I had clients with very obese beagles and they were giving me slices of bologna and human sugar cookies to give their dog.... so, THAT type of spoiling."
doggrooming,feiak0r,t1_fe9t45m,1579133994.0,"Okay, well, thanks for informing me of that... 

I'm not sure on where the owners got the pup. If they got a Nova Scotia for a Golden price, well...

More likely crossbreeding. Perhaps BYB, but who knows, I'm not about to ask the owners..."
curlyhair,fehy7td,t1_fehxlm6,1579126254.0,"She's actually been going curly off and on for a few years now, apparently. After seeing this poster, I started looking at her instagram. Haha.

Edit: She seems to know the struggle http://imgur.com/a/KMlvVa6"
goldenretrievers,fdzr488,t1_fdjuono,1578793876.0,"Actually had another client ask me if he was an Irish Setter, since she could see his hair peeking out of the kennel."
doggrooming,fdzaif7,t1_fdkeayf,1578788238.0,"I can definitely see a similarity! The owners have had her since she was a puppy though, and Goldens are much more prevalent than Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers."
goldenretrievers,fdj5w6i,t3_elnjy3,1578459322.0,I normally use a slightly filter. This pup needs no filter. http://imgur.com/a/Wbg0Ib6
aww,fdj43kd,t1_fdj3pv3,1578457913.0,"My guess too. A lot of shepherd mixes have the same look.

OP, any answers?"
aww,fdj2rad,t1_fdj2lmd,1578456928.0,"Could definitely see it being a shep lab mix. I'm a dog groomer, so this is a figure out the breed challenge. Hahaha."
aww,fdj25lx,t1_fdj1kfn,1578456494.0,"Oh! That's a good guess! I'm guessing it's some shepherd mix. Ridgeback mix kind of fits the body type.

Eta: maybe... think it's just a shep mix."
aww,fdj14p0,t1_fdj10w7,1578455775.0,"I was thinking Malamois over GSD, but the ears definitely don't match that."
aww,fdiyqd9,t1_fdipxwu,1578454117.0,"Definitely host dog is a malamute, but op, what breed is your gorgeous dog!? That dog needs some love and appreciation as well. Look how happy it is to be going on an adventure!"
doggrooming,fdirn1o,t3_elg26z,1578449502.0,"I'm a sucker for any dog named Chewie (and spelled that way!) since my own dog is also named Chewie.

This one is MUCH prettier than mine. He's adorable!"
doggrooming,fd7q25a,t1_fd7fd2s,1578208314.0,"I'm only 33 and started grooming late. About 7 years now. I'm trying to convince my body to not give up. Lots of ice, stretches, braces, and heating pads."
doggrooming,fd7oa6x,t1_fd742av,1578207537.0,Very true. I'm lucky. Paying affordable healthcare act about $125 a month and hardly using it.
doggrooming,fcw74ym,t3_ej8myc,1578018684.0,"Been dating a guy about a month. We were talking about German Shepherds. I told him I LOVED them and about how a guy made an appointment for one and that over the phone he said he was pretty protective and never bit, but showed agression and asked if he could stay for the groom. I explained why I advise against the owner staying. He still seemed a bit wary, but completely understood. When he brought him in for the appointment, I was cautiously checking him over and he decided to just start giving me kisses. Definitely put the owner at ease, and me. The guy I'm dating asked for the last name and after giving it, he said he'd totally heard that exact story before, from the owner.  GSD client had given my (future) date my salon number recommending me to him for his dog.

Just really hits home that the important moments to you as a groomer might also be important moments to the client, and it's a FANTASTIC feeling."
AmITheAngel,fcw5ohw,t1_fcglozy,1578017742.0,"Haha, I lurked too. I think he's genuine, but the girlfriend/baby momma doesn't seem to care about the money, but he's sooo worried about it being an issue that he's hiding it from her. In real life (not the internet) the reluctance to reveal information is going to have more detrimental effects on the relationship than just telling the truth and then talking about it."
Petland,fcw46zy,t1_fcw3y0j,1578016753.0,No problem! I hope that you sharing it with him brings him some joy during a hard time.
Petland,fcw3utc,t1_fcw2w1w,1578016530.0,"That's very sweet. I don't want to take away from that, so I'll actually post my pup that I got from PetLand. 

http://imgur.com/a/X7pfTGB he's the love of my life. If I didn't have him I wouldn't have found my passion for dog grooming."
Petland,fcw2ire,t3_eg1h9y,1578015642.0,"Hey, I'm not sure what exactly you want to gather from creating this sub, but I do want to make you aware that there might be some negativity coming towards you. 

I use to work at a PetLand around 12 years ago, and I definitely did not agree with many of my store's practices. 

As it was so long ago that I worked there (and I was only working in one store among many), I can't speak for how things are run now or if my store was run differently than others might have been run then."
DearEvanHansen,fch1upa,t1_fcfrvnx,1577646460.0,"Like I said in my other comment, I'm also looking forward to seeing what he brings to the character."
DearEvanHansen,fcfhqyr,t3_eh6eht,1577630073.0,"I knew absolutely nothing about him until I saw this tiktok and then looked him up on IMDb, wiki, and then searched him here.  

No one will ever be better than Ben Platt, but this kid really hasn't done much. Especially not anything that really shows acting chops (maybe Mark in Rent, but he's kind of the weakest character), so it's a toss up, but I'm looking forward to seeing what he might bring to the character."
AmITheAngel,fcfavi7,t1_fcfaj30,1577628181.0,More than somewhat.
doggrooming,fcfa2hq,t1_fcf8rsy,1577627939.0,"They're trying. She didn't have a great beginning and also has some heath issues. I'll look into it and recommend. They're attentive owners. They adopted her because she was in need, but they may be out of their element with her, but I think they're trying and are willing to put in effort."
TikTokCringe,fcf8k0a,t1_fcf5jb3,1577627551.0,I saw this for the first time about a week ago. I'm just now coming out of it and sharing this doozy  with others.
AmITheAngel,fcf5epb,t3_eh5z7f,1577626764.0,Bonus: Top comment gives no AITA judgement
TikTokCringe,fcexrrb,t3_eh5h9f,1577624686.0,"Actual title was ""pov: The girl I liked was kissing a guy at a party,so I went into another room and this is how we met"". So, cringe galore."
TikTokCringe,fcev9xr,t1_fceted5,1577624073.0,That freaking scoot closer is terrifying.
doggrooming,fce2kn0,t1_fce1ime,1577616315.0,Oh no! I've definitely gotten bit that way before. It's the worst! I'm saving your life and you're biting me because I'm touching you!?
doggrooming,fce0xes,t1_fce0nbv,1577615820.0,And thankfully no bites yet. Hopefully that'll continue. Haha.
AskReddit,fce06bv,t1_fcd8wcc,1577615545.0,"Also, they love mentioning gaslighting.

I'm lactose intolerant. It makes me sick every time I eat it. Lately my boyfriend is trying to get me to not eat dairy.

Responses ""he's gaslighting you!"""
doggrooming,fcdxo3a,t1_fcdwvy7,1577614840.0,"Yeah, thankfully these owners are completely understanding on the issue. The don't want me pushing her too hard, which is AMAZING."
doggrooming,fcdwijs,t1_fcduqqc,1577614557.0,"I work alone in a salon I own, I do utilize muzzles.  This pup has a few issues with collapsing trachea (why the grooming loop is around her belly) and a heart murmur, so the main goal is just to not stress her out too much while doing whatever I can."
funny,fcda76b,t1_fcbr5ti,1577608151.0,"As a dog groomer, I definitely agree.  It's the dog breed I've been bitten by most.  Also breed I've had to refuse to groom or been forced to refuse to finish grooming the most often too."
Pikmin,fcd8701,t1_fcd7ohj,1577607566.0,Fair enough.
Pikmin,fcd7iwq,t1_fc3ynmn,1577607325.0,"As is, it's just a Santa hat that happened to be folded weird. http://imgur.com/a/AGuPPhY
