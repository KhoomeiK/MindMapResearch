They’re a low cost option for those that need it. I think they charged like $30? This was a few years ago. I think it depends on income level. 

To put that in perspective, this is from the Ontario Psychology Association site:

CrossStitch,fehbk2k,t1_fegtsj8,1579113177.0,"I love it when things are made simpler. I find it takes a lot of joy out of cross-stitching when you have to waste so much time getting ready, either sewing or taping the edges of the cloth and winding the bobbins or organize the thread in some way. 

I usually take a little tiny piece of the thread and tape it to the chart. Especially for complicated patterns (Teresa Wentzler - I’m looking at you!), where you may have a light green and a very light yellow-green that may look similar. The only way to tell which is which is it the pattern tells you you’re supposed to have twice as much of one as the other. 

I see some of you even mark every 10 rows (which I a haven’t done yet, but such a brilliant idea!).

They’ve done some interesting research as well. It’s tough for musicians. They have a sort of high they get from performing, and they are looking into how people deal with the after effects post performance. Drugs and alcohol are one possible outlet. 

The music industry is potentially more prone to issues for a couple of reasons. The musicians as well as their crews are away from family, friends and other supportive factors when they’re on the road which is challenging. Over the Bridge provides connections to resources and a virtual peer support network."
