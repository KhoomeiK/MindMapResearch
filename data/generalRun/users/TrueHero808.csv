That’s like abusing your kid or pet because you technically own them. I don’t see the relevance of you stating he doesn’t do what he does for entertainment.

We have laws to ensure safer and happier lives. This is all true. That doesn’t mean that laws could be made that are immoral, however. A strong example of an existing one would be abortion. I myself am pro choice but I can understand why some people would be pro life. Ethics and morality are the key principles that determine what is right/wrong. Obviously different people have different opinions, and different moralities/ethic codes and so on."
