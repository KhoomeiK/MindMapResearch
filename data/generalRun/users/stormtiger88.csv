DMAcademy,fdkorpp,t3_elmn24,1578508009.0,"This is amazing. I have two players rolling a siamese twin together (we'restill working mechanics out), and that had me start exploring a concept similar to yours for the homebrew campaign I'm having LMoP lead to."
DMAcademy,fddmxgb,t3_cu1yzg,1578318185.0,"I just want to say thank you to the experienced DMs in this post. I'm starting a new group with people from work. Some of these folks have never even met each other, and none of us have played together. I'm also the only one with any DM experience, and I can count the number of sessions I've DM'd before launching our new campaign on one hand (four, to be exact). All of those sessions have been one-shots with my regular group, so a session zero was never necessary.

I'm grateful for this community, and I want you guys to know it!"
DMAcademy,fddlwo9,t1_fcpef8w,1578317217.0,"Thank you for linking this. I'm starting with a new group from work soon, and none of us have ever played together. Hell, some of us don't even know each other. I'm glad I did a search before posting ""how do you do a session zero?"""
bipolar,fdb9uyr,t1_fdb9iin,1578255273.0,"I agree. I think this is what makes my relationship so good. He's type 1 and I'm type 2 (debatable, but definitely bipolar). At first, I was afraid that both of us being bipolar was a recipe for disaster, but it has turned into a great boon. I get him and he gets me, on a level that neither of us has ever had a partner understand before."
bipolar,fdb7wdf,t3_ekhm32,1578254781.0,"I feel like we're more fiercely devotedly and loyal when we find the right person to be in a relationship with. When things are good, they're amazing."

bipolar,fd5hqyl,t3_ek1jib,1578177792.0,"I worked in my university's ODS for seven years and did not know that bipolar disorder is a qualifying condition. Struggling with the disorder is why I dropped out, after failing five or six classes. My college record actually gives me an idea of when onset was for me.

Thanks for sharing this, because I plan on going back after I have my baby."
