It wasnt like i was not going to pull the rip cord. As a tandem jumper you literally dangle outside of the plane while your instructor is inside. For a moment it is just you, all alone, swaying back and forth in a harness 10,000 feet in the air. He then lets go and you start to free fall. The feeling is indescribable. For about 10-20 seconds you get an intense rush of adrenaline. So intense you forget everything. You pull the ripcord and hit the brakes once the chute opens. Everything goes silent. It is so surreal and peaceful. I looked around and noticed how beautiful everything was. I felt lucky to be a part of this world. It was like all my problems were left inside that rickety plane. I realized there was more to life. Looking around at all the cars and houses I knew I wasnt alone. The closer to the ground we got the more calm that flowed over me.
