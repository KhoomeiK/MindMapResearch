aww,ffwg21p,t1_ffvzlga,1580299707.0,*Someone* has never had a cat...
aww,ffvvfyo,t1_ffvu0tt,1580274443.0,"That's what I meant by the quotations ... and yes, I totally agree."
SanJoseSharks,ffvqutx,t1_ffum2n0,1580270714.0,"Oh trust me.  As a Stars fan here, we barely have the Cap space for our current roster.  There have been IR moves this season just to stay under the cap."
aww,ffvqn1c,t1_ffvcrrm,1580270549.0,"You're not wrong, but just remember each cat is legitimately an individual.

My first cat was indoor/outdoor, and she absolutely refused to wear collars (we tried the bell collars, she would lose them ASAP).  She also earned her nickname of ""huntress"" ... constantly would catch stuff and take it into the house.  Talkative, but not excessively so.  Also, I was her boy (relevant b/c idk but it is).

My family now has two male cats.  One of them just the cutest but also laziest dudes ever (he's always been a small cat) who basically nevers meows, instead purring 24/7.  The *other* is the loudest, most rambunctious feline I have ever seen.  Is he clever?  Very.  Smart?... Well, not so much I think.

PS: The lazy guy is ""mine"" (as much as you can truly own a cat ... cat people understand), has been since I was in 7th grade and I'm 24, almost 25 now.  I'm perhaps a little biased on my opinions of them."
Scotland,ffteecg,t1_fftczyy,1580218115.0,"Well, I myself cannot say with certainty who it was (my family has it in records/from a book somewhere, I do not have it memorized or saved myself) but I can at the least trace back to a specific name.  With that said, I do believe it was a fairly common male name within the Clan.

As to the second bit, I concur.  Heck, even within the States we identify by state/region/city.  Not sure why it's a thing exactly - not to such an extent, anyway - but as someone born/raised in a certain central/southern State, I cannot claim that I don't do it."
Scotland,fftbwoa,t1_fft5n9q,1580215834.0,"Thanks for that.  I quite honestly didn't know.  If I may ask, why is it not something that is cared about?

Perhaps it's just how I was raised, but I see no reason to not be proud of familial ties.

PS: I have been to Scotland before, although it was part of a church trip/""pilgrimage."".  The comments on the beauty of the highlands are very much legitimate."
Persona5,fftb8fl,t1_fft8lsh,1580215183.0,"She's the Pink Ranger now  ... according to P4A, anyway."
hockey,ffsv2zm,t1_ffsroz7,1580193624.0,"Finally someone in this thread recognizes Josh/Razor.  Honestly, we've had better in the past (first Ralph & Razor then Strader at one point) but regardless, current pair is amazing.

I also happen to like the Philadelphia feed.

EDIT: Realized I mentioned Strader twice instead of Ralph Strangis.  Felt bad.  Changed it!"
Scotland,ffsnw5d,t3_euue8b,1580186611.0,"One of these days I'll make it to Fort William, I swear.  

I realize this is not Ben Nevis in the photo, but my family can trace back to Clan Cameron ... also, the Highlands are just absolutely beautiful, as the title states.

I have always felt more connection (I guess?) to my Scottish ancestry than English or German sides."
Persona5,ffrz9rl,t1_ffrohwc,1580169323.0,Beat me to it!
Showerthoughts,ffpzn3k,t1_ffptzha,1580112538.0,You mentioning those three things makes me wonder if you've seen the skit/song from Adam Sandler: https://youtu.be/e9N6_Tj9u2U
Persona5,ffiq807,t1_ffim47c,1579979993.0,"If I were not already in August in FES I would restart with Portable just to be able to control my party.

Ex. No, Akihiko, when the shadow is weak to Zio skills I do NOT want you to use a physical skill when I set your tactic to *knock down*.

PS: I may play The Answer eventually, but it's not a big deal to me if I never do."

miragemains,ff8olej,t1_ff874mi,1579689094.0,Of course!
Persona5,ff8ok7g,t1_ff83jwp,1579689046.0,"I would say the age of the game still applies, honestly.  I was sure as heck spoiled before I got into the game.  Maybe it's just because I like watching Speedruns of games before I buy since I've found it helps me decide on games as someone who has a couple I run myself but even so."
Persona5,ff8337o,t1_ff82v54,1579664699.0,"I was told yesterday on Twitch that mentioning a game having cutscenes but not mentioning anything ABOUT those scenes was spoiler material.  Like, it's a single player RPG ...  me mentioning the existence of cutscenes after a big fight (while again not mentioning what about) is spoiling ... what, exactly?"
patientgamers,ff82hp5,t3_es2jhj,1579664260.0,"Potentially Spearhead Games stuff?

The ones I know of personally are Stories: The Path of Destiny and Omensight (I know Omensight had a much darker vibe to it, but alas) but there's other games from them you could look into.  Also Bastion/Transistor or Velocity 2X?

I know what I have mentioned are not the type of adventure games you mentioned (mostly over-the-shoulder types) but they're nice stories and to my knowledge mostly kid friendly."
Persona5,ff81r3c,t1_ff7f1tr,1579663717.0,"I get hate regarding Royal-specific spoilers but if you're here and don't want base game spoilers what are you even doing here?

But also, yes, this specifically doesn't actually spoil anything.  It's just a screencap from the game."
Persona5,ff7rx7b,t1_ff6c8rd,1579656884.0,"Going through FES (not Portable unfortunately) now and yes I agree entirely.  Like... I gotta stop hanging out with my girl Yuko because I want to date Mitsuru later and be loyal?  Come on, game!

PS: I love Yuko the character but don't really want to date her, so it's hella annoying."
Persona5,ff7ri7p,t1_ff7k8tb,1579656598.0,But unless they're specific to Royal it's not a spoiler.  Vanilla game been out long enough...
MasterReturns,fev7615,t3_eqblh2,1579393926.0,"I turned the sound on my phone on just to hear that tail.  Not good doggo, *Best doggo*."
AskReddit,feuj3wx,t3_eqfgfg,1579386985.0,"Probably the one to make the biggest impression on me recently (to follow with the trend I see here, mostly seen with less research/fanfare) would be Ad Astra.  I went into that movie knowing I love sci-fi, I love space, and I love psychological drek in my sci-fi.

Much more recently, however, is 1917.  I will never claim to be an expert of film and film techniques, but I would say I know more than the average person ... I absolutely loved the cinematography used in that film.  I also happen to be a HUGE military history buff with (roughly) Civil War-Korean being one of my favorite periods of military history."
miragemains,fennfpp,t1_fenmcs4,1579288181.0,"The decoys will mark positions of any Bangalore/Caustic/Gibby when you send them into gas/airstrikes as well as mark positions of players if their grenade hits the decoy.  It's not thought about often, honestly, but a very useful tool when used well."
AskReddit,fefxno4,t3_eou6il,1579068631.0,"One of the Air Force pilot dreams I had, for sure.  I was in AFROTC even, but I focused too much on the whole Cadet thing and not enough on school."
apexlegends,fefj4s8,t1_fees7si,1579057410.0,"Even for Wraith mains, there are tiers.  You have your standard Wraith main, and then you have your TTV Wraith mains."
AskReddit,fedv81z,t3_eojqln,1579020603.0,Either Phoenix Wright or Nelson & Murdock
patientgamers,fe09q5h,t1_fe0306y,1578807061.0,"So, then, where does Another Eden (mobile game but same devs and extremely similar premise) fit in?"
worldnews,fe08toi,t1_fe00wze,1578806246.0,Apparently it's partially the lack of Iranian NOTAMs to indicate no-fly zones and the airliner flew too close to a SAM Site.  This doesn't excuse that it happened or the lack of further research on the part of the Iranian soldiers and commander(s) who were directly involved.
