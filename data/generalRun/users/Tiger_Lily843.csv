unpopularopinion,fdf5tss,t3_el0178,1578353984.0,I didn't start drinking til I was about 24. Dealt with drunks in the family including my dad who kicked me out just because...at the time he would come home drunk everyday after work.  Im almost 28 now and I'm over it. It DOES help with shyness..but I've read (after experiencing it for myself) that those who are shy tend to get EXTREME anxiety while being hung over. 0/10 definitely would NOT recommend. Plus I've gained some weight. It's a waste of money and causes people to age as well.
