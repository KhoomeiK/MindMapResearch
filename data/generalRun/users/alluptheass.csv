So all of those cops were lying? Or they don't know the law? Or is it a situation where *technically* the state can prosecute, but in reality they almost always choose not to unless an individual chooses to press charges? I am guessing it's the last one.

The wind is gone. Has been for generations. No weather of any kind. Not a cloud in the sky. No sunsets or sunrises. The land, too. Swallowed up by the sea, some say. No one knows how or why. 

Now the sky is closing in. Birds everywhere fall dead. The perpetual light darkens a little every day. 

When the party investigates, they learn that the entire sea - and everything in it - was eaten by an enormous creature, and now it is in the process of swallowing. When they try to seek a way to stop the thing, they learn of Davey Jone's blessing, which powers-up their melee weapons. Every swing of a blessed weapon forms an energy blade one million times the size of the original weapon - with equivalent reach and damage. So armed, they must journey to the end of the sea, exit the creature, and fight it. It is in the C+ size category (approximately the same mass as Earth)."

Because it is a baby, and sometimes babies blink. Sadly, this coincidence is all Pemela needs to reaffirm her suspicion that Dr Spatnik is full of it. The lizard men really *are* secretly enslaving us through vaccines. They really *will* activate the dormant nanites injected into us to force us to walk off the edge of the Earth. NASA really *is* representing the Earth as round as part of a global conspiracy to throw us off the scent. The ghost of Jeffrey Epstein really *is* monitoring Pemela's brain waves and reporting back to the lizard men. And, of course, Machael - her pet turtle when she was seven - really *has* reincarnated to save us all.

Pemela tears her uniform off, tossing it away unceremoniously, then marches purposefully toward the sky way leading to St. Endrew's Children's Hospital's south parking garage. En route, she removes her bra and panties for good measure. There are vital tasks to attend to, her shift can wait. She is blissfully unaware of just how true the latter half is. Her shift *very much can* wait, because there is no shift. Pemela is not actually a delivery nurse as St Endrew's. She'd just fished an old uniform out of the dumpster and, in the hour or so she'd been wandering around the hospital, no one had yet caught on.

Eyebrows are raised and abacks are taken at the corpse-thin nude woman striding through the corridors. Someone heads down to the front desk to report it, but by the time they get there Pemela is long gone.

The tires on her ‘93 civic squeal and nearly come off the ground as she speeds into the postage stamp of a driveway to her tiny home. Seconds later she bursts through the front door and makes a beeline for the bathroom.

As she's doing so, she feels something warm and soft caress her body.

That it's okay if my attention span lapsed and I have to ask about something that's already said. That it's okay if I don't know the book cover-to-cover and have to ask about something that's found in there. That it's even okay if my understanding of the subject is so awful I ask something that I thought mattered but was actually irrelevant.  

**Everything** you could ever ask your teacher is answered in some book, somewhere, and/or online. When do you say ""that question should be researched independently"", and when do you say, ""this question can be asked?"" *You* might find one simple enough to be looked up, and the other complex and needing explanation; but I guarantee you *someone* out there finds both simple, and someone else finds them complex enough to necessitate a walk through.

People can confuse themselves more trying to look something up on their own, or find an incorrect answer. And it's not always practical for the teacher to have a line going out the door for questions after every class. The classroom is a balancing act between progressing the whole class through the material and ensuring there are as few left behind as possible. Some amount of class time is sacrificed to the latter. And, imho, that should be okay."

If a burglar broke into a house, then someone chased the burglar around the neighborhood with a shotgun, then the burglar ducked into a crowd of people and the person fired on them anyway, the people in the crowd they killed *would* be victims.

That said, this doesn't add up.

The following two states:

1. he responds to your story of horrific past trauma by getting jealous of your abusers and angry at you for robbing him of the opportunity to do something similar to you
2. he loves you

*cannot* exist simultaneously. They simply cannot. Something else is going on. Some factor is missing. It could be any number of things - either extrinsic or intrinsic to him. He could be lying and he doesn't really love you. He could hail from some disturbed culture that normalizes this sort of thing and either doesn't acknowledge or mutilates the very concept of love (think ISIS keeping teenage girls for the sole purpose of being raped by their members). Or he could be a sociopath (or suffer from some other psychological condition that renders him unable to properly understand, process, or exhibit basic empathy). Or some combination, or any number of other things. Whatever it is, if you are going to remain with this man it behooves you - it is *vital* for you - to identify the factor(s) involved, so that you can know how to proceed with him.

Again, I am so sorry. I wish you the best of luck."

Yeah, it was ignorant for him to imply that life is easier for a section of the population of which he has never been a part.

unpopularopinion,fedaet9,t3_eoadpr,1579005612.0,"My first experience with this issue came \~5 years ago. I was working alongside some female college students, it was pre-Oscars , and they were discussing it. Since I had never heard it before, I asked why they felt the way they did. Their response was to scream at me, berate me, call me ""stupid"", ""racist"", and ""the problem"". I hadn't used any straw man argument. I hadn't attempted to undermine, or belittle them or their argument in any way. I simply asked a question because it was something I didn't know about and I wanted to learn more.

And that's where my knowledge stands, to this day. If someone asks me about it, I simply respond that I haven't noticed it. Because experience has taught me that if I attempt to engage with the group who seems to have, I will be lambasted. Similarly, had my math or history teachers started off by calling me an ignorant, stupid, racist POS because I didn't understand math or history, I'm quite sure I would not know any math or history to this day.

And this comment section looks about how my experiences tell me it should. While there are some reasoned, informative comments from the side opposing OP, there are also a whole lot calling OP (or those who take OP's side) ""racist"", ""ignorant"" or ""stupid"".

Those who believe this is truly a problem seem frustrated by the fact that it stubbornly persists. If it is, and it does, then I believe that is because those who are ""in the know"" chose hostility, belligerence, and condescension over dialogue and healthy communication as their preferred method of dissemination."
