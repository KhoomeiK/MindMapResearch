AskReddit,ffjgffz,t1_ffj4784,1579997709.0,"So this is neither my practice area nor I suspect the jurisdiction in which I practice, however I don’t believe in most common law jurisdictions that would be quite correct. Yes, the person who was slandered would be the claimant and so the burden of proof will be with them. However, what they will need to demonstrate is that the slanderous statement was made by the defendant and that they suffered loss as a result. 

The defendants would claim truth as defence but civil litigation is decided on the balance of probabilities - a much lower standard than “beyond reasonable doubt” as is applied in criminal trials - and so the bald statement “I believed it” without pointing to any evidence at all is, I believe, unlikely to be sufficient to sway that balance. The claimant doesn’t really need to prove the defendant didn’t believe it so much as make a slightly better agreement that they probably knew or at least suspected it wasn’t true than the defendant can make to support their defence. Even if the defendant can claim “Mrs Smith down the street told me” and have their gossipy neighbor attest to that fact - and  altruistically open herself up to potential litigation - in my jurisdiction a statement made with reckless disregard for its accuracy can also amount to slander and so that is not necessarily going to cut it either. I know in some jurisdictions the belief also has to be “reasonable” though I *think* that is more typical in civil law jurisdictions- but don’t quite me on that one.

If we are going to get technical there are other limited circumstances where truth does not act as defence - particularly where the information repeated is something which ought reasonably to be kept confidential such as the publication of medical records or analogous information, as in Campbell vs Mirror Group, although that was a libel case and involved a professional “news” (lol) publication and so that may have been factored in to the decision (haven’t read it for about ten years). Of course that case also largely pre-dates modern data protection/privacy concerns and so I wonder if it would adjudicated even more sympathetically in a modern environment. 

Again, not my practice area, not my jurisdiction, so I could certainly be wrong about the legal position in OP’s part of the world but I think the above broadly reflects the principles under common law as I was taught them. And of course, given the costs associated with litigation, the fact that you think can successfully defend a slander claim is not necessarily sufficient incentive to make the statement.

Usual disclaimer to anyone actually bothering to read this essay to NEVER TAKE LEGAL ADVICE FROM REDDIT OR ANYWHERE ELSE ONLINE. You need a lawyer who owes you a duty of care and who specialises in the relevant area, be they court appointed, volunteer or high priced. Don’t let some asshole like me spouting off half remembered principles they learned at law school convince you of ANYTHING."

DynastyFF,ffhta3i,t1_ffhodvh,1579952779.0,"Brees is great no doubt, but his skill possession players are 10x what Brady has. Brees has both a top 2 WR and a top 5 RB, and even his secondary options would be WR2s on the Pats laughable depth chart. If you watch any Saints games he’s good for a few absolute ducks of a deep ball every game, and it’s clear Payton  actively schemes around it. This isn’t my theory, his declining arm is pretty much acknowledged in NFL and media circles. 

Which is not to say he isn’t still a great QB, but his numbers belie the decline in his arm. Whilst I would say the opposite is true for Brady - his numbers suffer from a poor offensive cast and in recent years run-first offence. He can still ball."
DynastyFF,ffgxgf7,t1_ffgwjtt,1579917563.0,"I think so yes. His arm has held up much better than Brees and I certainly think he keeps defences honest.

DynastyFF,feph2a4,t1_fenmauk,1579320309.0,"Lol 27? Julio just put up an overall WR3 season at age 30 dude. WR ages a LOT better than RB.

Remember when Hopkins has his down year and followed it up with back to back overall WR1 seasons? Very much in the range of outcomes for obj. Maybe he’s done performing at that level but based on the body of work I’d lean towards this season being the aberration. Perhaps AJB surpasses him regardless, but based on what we know right now calling this some kind of steal for the OBJ seller just reeks of recency bias."
DynastyFF,fen8341,t1_felz8k5,1579279028.0,Really? A trade down of c.12 spots to swap AJB for OBJ? I don’t think that’s a horrible deal for the AJB owner at all. OBJ was on historic pace before this season. If anything I’d say there’s too much recency bias going on if that’s considered trade rape.

DynastyFF,fdm6axa,t1_fdk4t7a,1578540847.0,"The value of most players past 26 or so “will only go down”. The relevant question is “will this player produce for me at a high level over the foreseeable future”. I think conventional wisdom in dynasty is that you should not try to project more than 3 seasons out at most, as the league is just so damn unpredictable. I agree with this philosophy. Not applying this thinking is why a lot of players weigh age too heavily.

I would argue midway through another 1400 yard season at age 30, you could project Julio to maintain, at worst, top 10 production through 2022, and it is a mistake to try to look beyond that in any case. Therefore he should garner as good a return as any other top 10 WR with top 5 upside. He ultimately finished as the WR3 in PPR this season, so you’d have ended up buying half a season of top 3 production plus whatever his future holds. Even conservatively projecting the next two seasons that is worth a haul. Basically any playoff team in my league that had bought him for a young player + picks would have been put over the top.  

Bad process (over valuing age) begets bad results (getting bitch slapped by me in the playoffs)."
