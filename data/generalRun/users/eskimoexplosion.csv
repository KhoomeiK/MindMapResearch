I personally don't think the 1.6T is a great engine and why Hyundai didn't do the 2.0T in the new Sonata lineup is beyond me(maybe a tech can answer that). That being said after replacing hundreds of engines at just my dealership I doubt Hyundai didn't take extra steps to ensure that won't happen again and if you're buying new or CPO sleep easy at night knowing Hyundai is willing to replace your engine if it does have a manufacturing related issue years down the road.

askcarsales,ffatayk,t1_ffasxkp,1579743993.0,"Powertrain is pretty much anything internally lubricated, anything that touches oil essentially and the comprehensive pretty much covers anything that doesn't exist as a standard maintenance item. Things that aren't covered are aesthetic issues like dents, scrapes, rips, tears, or standard maintenance items like spark plugs, brakes, rotors, tires, etc. Hyundai is pretty lenient generally when it comes what the warranty covers but that depends on how well your service department presents them to Hyundai. The Hyundai website has a PDF somewhere going over everything the CPO covers. If you do decide to finance you don't have to fight tooth and nail to get the APR down to dust and ashes if the goal is to just build credit and make a few payments. If financing at 0% gives you a $340/mo payment and a 4% takes you to $350/mo and you plan on paying it off in 4 months you're only paying $40 in interest plus whatever the loan acquisition fee is, let's say all said in done you'll pay $500 in interest and bank fees after 4 months, the dealership will generally take that off the price of the car if you finance because they'll likely make it back so you essentially paid nothing to build credit."
askcarsales,ffascmh,t1_ffas02t,1579743360.0,"They're all simple interest loans, if you pay it off in less than a year you're only paying a small amount in interest. Even at 10% you're not going to be shoveling out a lot in interest to pay a car off in 3-6 months. Having a well paid auto on your history might save you thousands more in the future if say you decide to have three kids and find yourself in the need of a reliable third row SUV in a few years that you have to finance in full"
askcarsales,ffarsmz,t3_eslggp,1579742985.0,"If you have the money to pay cash you should really consider financing and take on a loan for half a year and pay it off to build some credit since you have no prior auto loan history, this may help you in the future if you ever need to buy something else you can't pay cash for, it may also help you shave a few hundred more off the price of the car since the dealership gets to make a little bit with you financing but that's entirely up to you. Don't be afraid to pay a bit more for a lower mileage car since Hyundai warranties are based on original date of sale and CPO only gives you the remaining balance of the new car warranty so you'd only have 14k left on your comprehensive and only 54k left on your powertrain, if you pay a grand more for something with 20k miles you're getting an additional 26k warranty, and 80k left on the powertrain. It may seem like a grand or so on paper but if you're the average driver that's almost two full years of warrantied driving."

But that's literally what you said and it's 100% relevant to this discussion because you're accusing me of advocating for it. You clearly don't understand what i'm saying and have misinterpreted it or something. Bruh i'm done here. I'm not doing this with you anymore."

If I'm taking 71 to Polaris from downtown I might coast in the left lane til I get close to 270 and then safely merge into the middle lane when i'm within a maybe 5 miles of polaris and then i'll safely move into the right lane sometime after I pass 270 before getting off at Polaris. All i'm saying is I try to avoid being in the right lane while I'm passing by the 270 interchange that ways I don't have to deal with people getting on/off at 270 and they don't have to deal with me. If you disagree with that then i'm sorry that's how I drive and what I honestly deeply believe is safe. I see no reason to get into the right lane earlier than I need to. I'm not advocating blasting across three lanes to hit an exit, i'm talking about getting into the right lane a mile or half a mile before your exit. I see no logic in driving from downtown to polaris entirely in the right lane if I can avoid it."
Columbus,ff5zl1s,t1_ff5z5ht,1579615234.0,"So by your logic it's ok to just go for miles and miles in the right lane being in the way of people trying to get on even though being in the middle lane is an available option that wont affect the drivers commute? Absolutely the right lane should be used for overflow when traffic is heavy but 80% of the time driving extensively in the right lane can easily be avoided and benefits everyone. I mean just stay out of the right lane if you can, it's pretty simple, if not then whatever. The driver won't have to worry about people merging into their lane and people merging can deal with less cars, and if we can do this we should because it's not the LAW but it is good driving habits and only benefits everyone"

Columbus,ff5y5g7,t1_ff5xzue,1579614053.0,"I don't need a citation for logic, just don't get into the right lane til your exit is coming up and stay in the left lane if you're passing through"
Columbus,ff5wr06,t1_ff5npvc,1579612826.0,"In a three lane highway, the left most lane or ""fast lane"" is for cars not needing to get off on an exit for quite some time, the middle lane is for cars who have an exit coming up soon, you only merge into the rightmost lane when your exit is up next if possible, if everyone stuck to these principles there would rarely be cars in the rightmost lane when people are merging because everyone who enters that lane gets off expediently at an exit instead of continuing further and interfering with cars down the way trying to merge onto the freeway and causing backed up traffic all the way down the line. Unfortunately the right lane is mostly used by timid drivers that feel comfortable going 60 but not 65 and people rarely adhere to these principles

Edit: The right lane is not for being in all the time, it's a staging lane

> Generally, the right lane of a freeway is for entering and exiting the traffic flow. It is a staging lane, for use at the beginning and end of your freeway run. The middle lanes are for through traffic, and the left lane is for passing.
