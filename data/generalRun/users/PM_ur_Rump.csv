tifu,ffe9ss0,t1_ffe28qc,1579840666.0,"I talk/smile/wave to random kids sometimes (in some sort of appropriate context), and usually get no bad vibes from the parents.

Kid staring at me in the grocery line? ""Hey buddy! I like your shoes!"" Or whatever. Mom is usually friendly back.

But again, context, tone, boundaries, etc are important. And yes, it's better to do it with the parents present. And in a case like OP's, it can be a good idea to be upfront with the parent, which of course takes some social skills. Walk over and let her know that you share her concern about the little one talking to strangers, and you understand why she was a bit taken aback. Again, easier said than done if you are the awkward type, or somehow ""different"" looking."
drunk,ffe8q1k,t3_et44v7,1579839772.0,"For me, the munchies are just that, a desire to munch. Some light but fairly continuous snacking.

When the drunchies hit, it's a ravenous hunger that must be satiated. I require loads of rich foods. Full meals. I'll ring up huge food tabs. Appetizers, desserts, more drinks, more appetizers..."

AbandonedPorn,ffe5ner,t1_ffe48qk,1579837343.0,"It's a 70, needs a pan half welded in, have the new pan half, needs front-rear brake line installed, have that as well, decent trans, no engine installed but have several in various states of running or not. In at least as good a shape body-wise as any in this pic.

Also have a 70 Ghia, drove fine when I pulled the engine to put in my bus, new balljoints, tie rods, shocks, good brakes. Could stand some paint and body and floors, or just flat black it, slam an engine in and have a hoodride in a weekend."

And squarebacks/fastbacks/notchbacks were Type 3s, and the rare 411/412s were Type 4s.

Things were Type 181, and Ghias were pretty much just Ghias, unless they were a Type 34 Ghia.

Confused yet?"
shockwaveporn,ffe0x5d,t1_ffdp4z4,1579833840.0,"I thought about that too, but I'm pretty sure they mean 100m squared, not 100 square meters. So roughly a 112m diameter circle, which is still too close for comfort when shit is going kaboom.

An 11m circle using large caliber explosive munitions from several kilometers away is pretty much dead on."

I blasted off seemingly instantly, and spent most of the night bundled in a blanket with my gf thinking we were war orphans or something.

Another guy that ate the same stuff got into a several hour fight with a blackberry bush and came out covered in scratches head to toe and stained with piss."

The risk of getting RCs is real and a separate issue.

Not suggesting everyone go trip at school, but not judging them for it. I did it. Hell I walked into history class tripping, just to find out we were watching Shindler's List that day. That was a tough trip."
