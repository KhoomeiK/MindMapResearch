battlehawks,ffju3z9,t3_etmb79,1580006988.0,Love it. You should submit this to Battlehawks.
tifu,ffjgyxu,t3_etrazq,1579998028.0,This is my ideal way to die to be honest.
nfl,ffjdmw0,t1_ffi822z,1579996064.0,Can confirm. That bastard had 5 first half TDs against my Vikings one game.
relationships,ffjddgk,t3_etl7ge,1579995906.0,Shit my Ex broke up with me almost 2 years ago and I still have lingering feelings for her. But I also haven't been in a long-term relationship since then so I do wonder if it has more to do with missing being in a committed relationship. We also work together so we see eachother a lot which probably hasn't helped.
nfl,ffi3413,t1_ffhgxc4,1579963683.0,I am not going to lie. I thought Curry was going to be a beast. I was super wrong about him and RGIII.
nfl,ffi30lt,t1_ffgo9d5,1579963602.0,2009 doesn't seem that long ago.
nfl,ffi2wwi,t1_ffgy6il,1579963514.0,They probably don't even know they used to be in the AFC.
nfl,ffgoolh,t1_fffbbfl,1579911192.0,He wasn't always this crazy though. And you could be right. But it is weird how his erratic behaviour lines up with the Burfict hit so much.
nfl,ffgjb4w,t1_fff791v,1579907541.0,That wasn't in his face though.
minnesotavikings,ffgheb6,t1_fff13gt,1579906281.0,The pattern doesn't say you can't have good seasons in between. Vikes lost 41-0 to Giants in the 2000-2001 NFC Championship too.
nfl,ffevnp5,t3_et3k11,1579867489.0,LOL. No possible way Burrow doesn't go 1. So perhaps Bengals trade out of the 1 pick. But no way they pick anyone but Burrow at 1 if they pick there.
nfl,ffeuk7b,t3_et4x58,1579866174.0,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl2yEd6Srtg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl2yEd6Srtg)

His best throw of the season and it was his 4th read."
nfl,ffeu57t,t1_ffea1p8,1579865642.0,The 1 pointers honestly don't look that easy. They shouldn't have them move that much since it is a 1 pointer afterall.
nfl,ffetx7o,t1_ffefat0,1579865354.0,"The sacks that are most frustrating to me are the ones that you can see coming a second or more in advance. Where it is clear he needs to get the ball out to a checkdown or a ""legal throwaway"". QBs often do throwaways in the pocket by throwing it out of bounds but in a WRs direction. Those sacks also kill drives. But overall I like what I saw from Kirk this season. Improve the left side of the OL. And hopefully Bradbury improves too. Vikings offense should be better next season. Their defense is going to be a big question mark though."
ChoosingBeggars,ffest04,t1_ffepep9,1579863842.0,I concur.
ChoosingBeggars,ffeslf7,t1_ffeqqj0,1579863543.0,Do you know how many foods are shaped like dicks? The best kind.
betterCallSaul,ffensqx,t1_ffel0oc,1579856370.0,I love both the movies. Gremlins 2 was ahead of it's time.
AskReddit,ffemubv,t1_ffd91v6,1579854967.0,Tell me she put out after that.
minnesotavikings,ffekgar,t1_ffekcz1,1579851769.0,"This is based on the start of the regular season year. Because the playoffs for the years would effectively be 1977,1988, 1999, 2010, and 2021 too. So nope didn't ruin the pattern. 1965 season did kind of though. Damn bastards."
Showerthoughts,ffedejw,t1_ffdy8zt,1579843932.0,I wish more movies showed bloopers at the end.
battlehawks,ffed1ul,t3_et4qik,1579843601.0,I am also a Vikings fan. Heinicke will bring BattleHawks to the promised land.
minnesotavikings,ffecawi,t1_ffebec2,1579842897.0,Yeah. I understand that. I was saying he is related to the less famous one.
minnesotavikings,ffe71xk,t1_ffe50g2,1579838424.0,Oh fine! I'll settle for that I suppose.
minnesotavikings,ffe4m8l,t1_ffe4jqb,1579836565.0,Hey don't ruin it. It was a 7-7 record.
minnesotavikings,ffe3zip,t1_ffdmqg4,1579836095.0,I thought he was related to Terry Metcalf (Running back). I was incorrect.
battlehawks,ffe0fxq,t3_et21o3,1579833492.0,Thought Terrance Williams would make the team for sure.
ChoosingBeggars,ffe01a6,t3_eswd3h,1579833202.0,One of the few times exposure actually makes sense instead of a price. Especially if they hit them up to do it.
minnesotavikings,ffdwl6q,t1_ffcs5hz,1579830722.0,I was on the keep Teddy and draft Lamar bandwagon. But I also was on the Kirk Cousins bandwagon too. But those were my top 2.
minnesotavikings,ffbu28s,t1_ff9quqc,1579782745.0,I'd still rather have Rhodes at CB than safety. It is not even worth thinking about this idea. At least at this point in his career and on the Vikings.
minnesotavikings,ffbu05n,t3_esg2y5,1579782688.0,I really don't want to waste my time reading an article on this. Cutting him saves a lot of money. Anthony Harris is a better safety than Rhodes could ever be and he would actually be cheaper. Yes this is a crazy idea. It makes no sense at all when you have Smith and Harris as the safety tandem. Not too mention Sendejo could easily be resigned.
NFCNorthMemeWar,ffbrmub,t1_ffbr1u3,1579780054.0,"Yeah. I would agree. But that is quickness. Regardless again those guys were relatively quick. I'd put some of his success against them on QB pressure, defensive scheme, and they are bigger so he was probably allowed to be more handsy without a penalty."
xfl,ffbht04,t3_esl6vh,1579765931.0,Lol I hate the name BattleHawks. Love the jerseys and Logo though.
minnesotavikings,ffbfsj5,t3_esm1kl,1579763376.0,I actually think Jimmy G and Kirk have a similar weakness. They just simply don't have the best ability to improvise with a chaotic pocket. Jimmy has been fortunate to have a good offensive line majority of his starts. Give Kirk his offensive line and mini rebuild defense through the draft. Resign Anthony Harris and extend Cook. I am a big believer in the whole is has to be greater than the sum of the parts to be a great team. SF obviously improved the sum of the parts. But they also significantly improved the team chemistry and I do think you can credit Jimmy G for that stablility.
minnesotavikings,ffbfg7g,t1_ffbf7ze,1579762962.0,Yeah I did but forgot to post it on this part. I posted it on its own. That is crazy though. 5 TD passes and 5 pick 6s. LOL! And a few of those Vikings teams have terrible pass Ds. I used to go to Vikes-Giants games a few years in a row in early 2000s (just because it worked out that way not because we wanted to see Giants). Vikes lost all 3. :-( Add in the 41-0 NFC Championship game I have some hated the Giants a lot. They made up for it since then by sucking verse the Vikings and beating the Patriots twice in the Superbowl though.
minnesotavikings,ffbez5r,t3_esm1kl,1579762402.0,I think yes. But with that said Jimmy G is overall a worse QB but when the clutch situations happen he plays his best. Similar to Eli Manning. And Cousins is the inverse of that. But the style of offense and everything. I do think Cousins would have made it to the  Super Bowl with them regardless. 49ers were by far the most talented and balanced team in the NFC and honestly probably the league.
minnesotavikings,ffbdnf4,t1_ffbdcbu,1579760884.0,I remember watching it on TV thinking it was a computer generated thing lol. I was tired and not thinking clearly lol. But in fairness my dad and brother only made it to northern Iowa (from St. Louis). They shut down I-35. They shouldn't have even attempted to go honestly.
minnesotavikings,ffb8nuq,t3_esk29h,1579755198.0,Without further ado..... Eli Manning had 5 TD passes against the Vikings in his entire career. He also had 15 interceptions against the Vikings. And the best stat of all... He had 5 pick-6s against the Vikings. Wowzors!
minnesotavikings,ffb84vh,t1_ffags10,1579754611.0,This has me wondering if Eli threw more TD passes to the Vikings than against the Vikings lol. I shall research.
minnesotavikings,ffb832i,t1_ffags10,1579754565.0,"I live in St. Louis. They had this game on TV locally. They cut the damn game off after the Giants tied it. So I had to gamecast the rest and see them march down and get into field goal range for the win. Such bullshit. Koren Robinson, Memo, and Mr. Raper all scored TDs."
minnesotavikings,ffb7tkj,t3_esk29h,1579754302.0,With some researched on [Pro-football-reference.com](https://Pro-football-reference.com) He is only 2-6 starting against Vikings. Unless I am missing something. The 2 wins he got were in 2010 against the Jackson (and some Webb) led Vikings that were terrible. And 2013 with freaking Josh Freeman at QB. They may have credited him with 2004 game but Kurt Warner was the starter and he never had a pass in the game.
minnesotavikings,ffb79s7,t1_ffb407h,1579753727.0,Lol. I forgot about that. So 2 of his 3 wins are against Tarvaris Jackson starting and Josh Freeman. Wowzors! (Edit: I thought it was Webb)
minnesotavikings,ffb77yp,t1_ffajvyq,1579753678.0,It's funny because the Giants owned us right before Eli and the Wilfs bought the team. One of Eli's 3 wins was against a Joe Webb (Not Joe Webb actually Tarvaris Jackson) Vikings. Webb played a little at end of game after Jackson got hurt. I remember watching this game in a little bar inside New York New York Casino in Vegas and my dad and brother tried to go to it but it was the roof collapse game. Played the game in Lions stadium on Monday night.
xfl,ffaywte,t1_ffaj0wt,1579747706.0,Shit I went to a bachelor party in Cleveland where we all traveled to get there. My buddy that was getting married is a big Cavs fan so the main part of the trip was going to Cavs game. Had the most stoned uber driver ever. He almost stopped on the interstate because he thought he was going the wrong direction on it lol. Plus telling us stories of the Browns days and throwing dog biscuits on the field. Lol.
NFCNorthMemeWar,ffau5o7,t1_ffatifr,1579744560.0,I am not even sure that is true. Deandre Hopkins ran a 4.57. Diggs and Thielen ran in mid to high 4.4s. Davante Adams ran a 4.56. Larry Fitzgerald ran 4.6. Michael Thomas 4.57. Juju 4.54 Keenan Allen 4.7.  People probably think OBJ is faster than both of them but he also ran slower than both of them in 40.
westworld,ffasdmt,t3_es8qa9,1579743379.0,I feel like this show is much more sci-fi than western.
NFCNorthMemeWar,ffar4w7,t1_ffaqwo3,1579742546.0,"Ok. I concede I shouldn't have said ""insanely fast"". But they are still certainly fast. They are still certainly better than NFL average like the OP stated."
AskReddit,ffaqxqt,t1_ffantkj,1579742409.0,I remember trying to find a specific cable there about 5 years ago. And they didn't have it. Like wtf.
NFCNorthMemeWar,ffaonk8,t1_ffaofls,1579740880.0,What percentile are they though? I am sure they are top 15-20% for NFL WRs with speed. Not very many people run sub 4.3 40s.
xfl,ffao9ct,t3_esbgxm,1579740611.0,I like how they have it set now. It will be finished before NBA and NHL playoffs (or right when they are beginning).
NFCNorthMemeWar,ffan0b9,t1_ff9xqo8,1579739768.0,No question that Slay is better.
NFCNorthMemeWar,ffallm1,t1_ff987jk,1579738807.0,My theory is Rhodes got the star treatment on non-calls. He was handsy with the WR no call. Now he isn't getting the special treatment and he is unsure and lacks confidence in himself on what he can or can't do.
NFCNorthMemeWar,ffalhgl,t1_ff99dkz,1579738726.0,You are aware Julio and Calvin Johnson are insanely fast?
relationships,ff8via2,t3_es84np,1579697497.0,It's posts like this that frustrate me the most because it is as simple as communicated. You need to talk to her about this. Lay it all out there. This situation has gotten to this point because of both of you. Her taking advantage of not paying and you not putting your foot down and explaining she needs to contribute.
fatlogic,ff8nvji,t1_ff7b4zx,1579688010.0,I agree. Like she wants to lose weight to feel better. She is admitted that health at every size is bullshit but she doesn't want to attack an identity she has invested heavily in.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ff7i0ht,t1_ff6b6d4,1579650010.0,What is weird is I could have swore I read a post like that before.
AskReddit,ff4l67g,t3_erhu3x,1579566281.0,It wasn't even a good dream. I was gambling in a casino and I was arrested. I was super curious where it was going from there (why was I arrested) but I woke up lol.
Showerthoughts,ff1y389,t3_er27ao,1579488822.0,The trick is not wasting time for a spot and just parking and if you walk a little more then oh well you walked a little more and burned a half a kCal.
49ers,ff1t60u,t1_ff1t438,1579485614.0,Not eligible or not healthy or both?
49ers,ff1t2tx,t3_er3n7k,1579485559.0,Question: is McKinnon eligible to return off IR and if so is he healthy enough to return of IR?
minnesotavikings,ff1gh04,t1_ff1en5w,1579478847.0,Well when they are talking 34 million a year price range. A rental year for 37 million isn't that bad. True though. I am still saying it is an option if they can't get a long term deal in place next offseason.
minnesotavikings,ff1aclh,t1_ff19y38,1579476832.0,He may not want to resign for less than over 30 million/year because of the new CBA up in the air.
minnesotavikings,ff18qm9,t1_ff0xng6,1579476371.0,If you can get him for 27 million a year or less I say go for it. But anymore you might as well not do it and have consideration for a 3rd time he gets franchised. Before it was no way it could happen but with how the cap is most likely going to increase a lot it is feasible option again. My problem with Cousins is he lack of ability to extend plays at all and he gets deer in headlights often when the pocket isn't clean and simply waits to be sacked. I just really hope we can improve the LG and LT for next season.
minnesotavikings,ff180z6,t1_ff10ify,1579476119.0,I will say it would make the Superbowl more interesting if they were in it. Because I don't hate the Chiefs or 49ers. I am cheering for Chiefs no matter what but if 49ers win it wouldn't bother me either.
minnesotavikings,fev6qdp,t1_feunwe3,1579393756.0,Zimmer is fired or contract not renewed.
nfl,fev3tgy,t3_eqlzpd,1579392799.0,Who the fuck leaves a game after one quarter?
minnesotavikings,fev3fi5,t3_eqnjiv,1579392649.0,"Even with the cap hell. Their is no reason for Vikings offense to regress next season unless the injury bug hits them. But yes the defense itself is in a rebuild season. Griffen, Rhodes, Joseph (maybe), Waynes, Alexander could all be gone. I do think Harris will be resigned. But outside of Griffen and Alexander they all underperformed this season too. I don't know if I buy that this team doesn't still have loads of talent. And if they improve that LG and LT spot on offense they could be a very dangerous offense to make up for the loss on the defense."
minnesotavikings,fev2ns2,t3_eqdtpm,1579392448.0,TIL I am old for already knowing this and slightly addicted to the Vikings.
relationships,feurkfj,t3_eqk7o2,1579389292.0,Just in general it is not the end of the world for you both to have personal leisure time without each other. Not only that it should be encouraged.
nfl,feuqu2r,t3_eqgrjd,1579389063.0,So they are both going to end up being Hall of Famers though right?
JurassicPark,femezf3,t1_femegrv,1579252022.0,No offense. But that's kind of on you there. If someone asked me that I would assume they would be up to date on the episodes and explain what is happening in the show instead of season/episode.
JurassicPark,fem5jag,t1_fem04hr,1579240500.0,Everyone ruined the red wedding for me. They didn't say what happened but it was easy to figure out what was going to happen.
fatlogic,felpx46,t3_eppewe,1579228069.0,Lol. I love the.. of course I don't trust my doctor. Amazing. Why would anyone trust their doctor?
nfl,feljvjd,t1_fekjrg9,1579223932.0,Looks like he live streamed it. I love how one of the comments was FTP! Lol!
minnesotavikings,fel3xp3,t1_fekcb19,1579213532.0,Pretty sure he is still on staff.
todayilearned,feit3dm,t1_feimmid,1579146498.0,It allowed you to learn they weren't your friends. I am not well off at all. I couldn't imagine asking and in some of these people's cases expecting a handout. It is crazy.
todayilearned,feisud8,t1_feikjiz,1579146317.0,"This is a good way of explaining it. But if I was to win a good amount of money I would not have any problem footing the bill for dinner or bar tab. That isn't where lottery winners are sucked dry. It is the people stealing from them, beggars, and phony investment opportunities. And the thing is. I also have a unique ability to say no to things. I'd set a budget and give and allowance to my closest family and have again having no problem saying no to them for more. The only additional support to extended family I would consider is medical expenses and paying directly for the medical expenses."
todayilearned,feirfjs,t1_feinc5x,1579145324.0,"Or a Nebraska 10,000."
todayilearned,feipuws,t3_epaqee,1579144241.0,They should absolutely be anonymous in the first place. I can't believe many places don't allow it because their argument is essentially transparency. But yet conspiracy theorists believe in crisis actors and crap. So how hard would it be for them to believe those people are pretending to have won the lottery? Way too much bad comes from making their names public.
nfl,feim1zx,t1_fegyoq5,1579141698.0,The more I read this thread the more baffling his name was even mentioned. I suppose he belongs in the Hall of Infamy.
nfl,feilp7u,t3_ep3g6t,1579141460.0,The more I think about it the more I feel Ozzie Newsome deserves to be in Hall of Fame again as an executive.
nfl,feilhv1,t3_ep3g6t,1579141317.0,Nevermind the move which was a big time dick move. Just the fact he fired Paul Brown who is probably the greatest coach of all-time IMO is enough to disqualify him from any honors. Then you can add in he fired Bill Belichick too. LOL! Wowzors!
nfl,feilb3j,t3_ep3g6t,1579141189.0,I don't really get why he would be Hall of Fame material. But I suppose I don't know enough. Nevermind the negatives about him. What are the positives about him to even be considered at all for this honor?
nfl,feiibqw,t1_fehp61i,1579139196.0,Exactly my first thought.
minnesotavikings,feie91e,t1_feeyan8,1579136470.0,This is why good is the enemy of great.
minnesotavikings,feie2sz,t3_eory5z,1579136353.0,I very much doubt Zimmer would simply accept a one-year extension. I think he should go on this lameduck season personally. Same with Cousins. And let the chips fall where they may.
minnesotavikings,feide5x,t1_fehwf2e,1579135893.0,He basically saved Alex Smith's career. Smith is looked at much differently after being coached by Harbaugh and Reid.
minnesotavikings,feidabb,t1_feht0c1,1579135821.0,I certainly would not be opposed to this at all either.
minnesotavikings,feid87d,t3_ep851v,1579135781.0,Josh Mcdaniels. I know BB coaching tree has not been great. Actually has been bad. But I do feel Mcdaniels might be the exception. He has experience as a Head coach and now has learned some more from BB.
minnesotavikings,feia66q,t3_eog5gv,1579133737.0,I do want to point out Moss's son was born before Moss rookie season. If it was after. I'd feel even older.
minnesotavikings,fei7qap,t3_ep69nq,1579132151.0,Yeah. I thought I was missing something too.
minnesotavikings,fei7f6c,t3_ep6h6g,1579131956.0,I feel it will be Gary or Klint Kubiak. Or Rick Dennison. Anyone outside of those 3 I will be a little surprised. But I do think we promote from within. Another darkhorse option could very well be Drew Petzing.

ChoosingBeggars,feey6vk,t1_feegzhj,1579043806.0,She didn't ask. She was requesting him to book the flights soon lol. But like you said she knew. She knew exactly what she was doing and now she is trying to rationalize her behaviour.
ChoosingBeggars,febsf6g,t1_febs7zq,1578962181.0,I agree. Just in general you don't deserve a discount. And if they do give one you should be thankful for it.
ChoosingBeggars,febr7s6,t1_feb4gwa,1578961793.0,I mean the businesses can do whatever they want.
minnesotavikings,fe181xo,t1_fdzus4k,1578823558.0,I would much rather the Vikes lose against 49ers than to have won then lost against Packers. That would have hurt far worse.

minnesotavikings,ffe3zip,t1_ffdmqg4,1579836095.0,I thought he was related to Terry Metcalf (Running back). I was incorrect.
battlehawks,ffe0fxq,t3_et21o3,1579833492.0,Thought Terrance Williams would make the team for sure.
ChoosingBeggars,ffe01a6,t3_eswd3h,1579833202.0,One of the few times exposure actually makes sense instead of a price. Especially if they hit them up to do it.
minnesotavikings,ffdwl6q,t1_ffcs5hz,1579830722.0,I was on the keep Teddy and draft Lamar bandwagon. But I also was on the Kirk Cousins bandwagon too. But those were my top 2.
minnesotavikings,ffbu28s,t1_ff9quqc,1579782745.0,I'd still rather have Rhodes at CB than safety. It is not even worth thinking about this idea. At least at this point in his career and on the Vikings.
minnesotavikings,ffbu05n,t3_esg2y5,1579782688.0,I really don't want to waste my time reading an article on this. Cutting him saves a lot of money. Anthony Harris is a better safety than Rhodes could ever be and he would actually be cheaper. Yes this is a crazy idea. It makes no sense at all when you have Smith and Harris as the safety tandem. Not too mention Sendejo could easily be resigned.
NFCNorthMemeWar,ffbrmub,t1_ffbr1u3,1579780054.0,"Yeah. I would agree. But that is quickness. Regardless again those guys were relatively quick. I'd put some of his success against them on QB pressure, defensive scheme, and they are bigger so he was probably allowed to be more handsy without a penalty."
xfl,ffbht04,t3_esl6vh,1579765931.0,Lol I hate the name BattleHawks. Love the jerseys and Logo though.
minnesotavikings,ffbfsj5,t3_esm1kl,1579763376.0,I actually think Jimmy G and Kirk have a similar weakness. They just simply don't have the best ability to improvise with a chaotic pocket. Jimmy has been fortunate to have a good offensive line majority of his starts. Give Kirk his offensive line and mini rebuild defense through the draft. Resign Anthony Harris and extend Cook. I am a big believer in the whole is has to be greater than the sum of the parts to be a great team. SF obviously improved the sum of the parts. But they also significantly improved the team chemistry and I do think you can credit Jimmy G for that stablility.
minnesotavikings,ffbfg7g,t1_ffbf7ze,1579762962.0,Yeah I did but forgot to post it on this part. I posted it on its own. That is crazy though. 5 TD passes and 5 pick 6s. LOL! And a few of those Vikings teams have terrible pass Ds. I used to go to Vikes-Giants games a few years in a row in early 2000s (just because it worked out that way not because we wanted to see Giants). Vikes lost all 3. :-( Add in the 41-0 NFC Championship game I have some hated the Giants a lot. They made up for it since then by sucking verse the Vikings and beating the Patriots twice in the Superbowl though.
minnesotavikings,ffbez5r,t3_esm1kl,1579762402.0,I think yes. But with that said Jimmy G is overall a worse QB but when the clutch situations happen he plays his best. Similar to Eli Manning. And Cousins is the inverse of that. But the style of offense and everything. I do think Cousins would have made it to the  Super Bowl with them regardless. 49ers were by far the most talented and balanced team in the NFC and honestly probably the league.
minnesotavikings,ffbdnf4,t1_ffbdcbu,1579760884.0,I remember watching it on TV thinking it was a computer generated thing lol. I was tired and not thinking clearly lol. But in fairness my dad and brother only made it to northern Iowa (from St. Louis). They shut down I-35. They shouldn't have even attempted to go honestly.
minnesotavikings,ffb8nuq,t3_esk29h,1579755198.0,Without further ado..... Eli Manning had 5 TD passes against the Vikings in his entire career. He also had 15 interceptions against the Vikings. And the best stat of all... He had 5 pick-6s against the Vikings. Wowzors!
minnesotavikings,ffb84vh,t1_ffags10,1579754611.0,This has me wondering if Eli threw more TD passes to the Vikings than against the Vikings lol. I shall research.
minnesotavikings,ffb832i,t1_ffags10,1579754565.0,"I live in St. Louis. They had this game on TV locally. They cut the damn game off after the Giants tied it. So I had to gamecast the rest and see them march down and get into field goal range for the win. Such bullshit. Koren Robinson, Memo, and Mr. Raper all scored TDs."
minnesotavikings,ffb7tkj,t3_esk29h,1579754302.0,With some researched on [Pro-football-reference.com](https://Pro-football-reference.com) He is only 2-6 starting against Vikings. Unless I am missing something. The 2 wins he got were in 2010 against the Jackson (and some Webb) led Vikings that were terrible. And 2013 with freaking Josh Freeman at QB. They may have credited him with 2004 game but Kurt Warner was the starter and he never had a pass in the game.
minnesotavikings,ffb79s7,t1_ffb407h,1579753727.0,Lol. I forgot about that. So 2 of his 3 wins are against Tarvaris Jackson starting and Josh Freeman. Wowzors! (Edit: I thought it was Webb)
minnesotavikings,ffb77yp,t1_ffajvyq,1579753678.0,It's funny because the Giants owned us right before Eli and the Wilfs bought the team. One of Eli's 3 wins was against a Joe Webb (Not Joe Webb actually Tarvaris Jackson) Vikings. Webb played a little at end of game after Jackson got hurt. I remember watching this game in a little bar inside New York New York Casino in Vegas and my dad and brother tried to go to it but it was the roof collapse game. Played the game in Lions stadium on Monday night.
xfl,ffaywte,t1_ffaj0wt,1579747706.0,Shit I went to a bachelor party in Cleveland where we all traveled to get there. My buddy that was getting married is a big Cavs fan so the main part of the trip was going to Cavs game. Had the most stoned uber driver ever. He almost stopped on the interstate because he thought he was going the wrong direction on it lol. Plus telling us stories of the Browns days and throwing dog biscuits on the field. Lol.
NFCNorthMemeWar,ffau5o7,t1_ffatifr,1579744560.0,I am not even sure that is true. Deandre Hopkins ran a 4.57. Diggs and Thielen ran in mid to high 4.4s. Davante Adams ran a 4.56. Larry Fitzgerald ran 4.6. Michael Thomas 4.57. Juju 4.54 Keenan Allen 4.7.  People probably think OBJ is faster than both of them but he also ran slower than both of them in 40.
westworld,ffasdmt,t3_es8qa9,1579743379.0,I feel like this show is much more sci-fi than western.
NFCNorthMemeWar,ffar4w7,t1_ffaqwo3,1579742546.0,"Ok. I concede I shouldn't have said ""insanely fast"". But they are still certainly fast. They are still certainly better than NFL average like the OP stated."
AskReddit,ffaqxqt,t1_ffantkj,1579742409.0,I remember trying to find a specific cable there about 5 years ago. And they didn't have it. Like wtf.
NFCNorthMemeWar,ffaonk8,t1_ffaofls,1579740880.0,What percentile are they though? I am sure they are top 15-20% for NFL WRs with speed. Not very many people run sub 4.3 40s.
xfl,ffao9ct,t3_esbgxm,1579740611.0,I like how they have it set now. It will be finished before NBA and NHL playoffs (or right when they are beginning).
NFCNorthMemeWar,ffan0b9,t1_ff9xqo8,1579739768.0,No question that Slay is better.
NFCNorthMemeWar,ffallm1,t1_ff987jk,1579738807.0,My theory is Rhodes got the star treatment on non-calls. He was handsy with the WR no call. Now he isn't getting the special treatment and he is unsure and lacks confidence in himself on what he can or can't do.
NFCNorthMemeWar,ffalhgl,t1_ff99dkz,1579738726.0,You are aware Julio and Calvin Johnson are insanely fast?
relationships,ff8via2,t3_es84np,1579697497.0,It's posts like this that frustrate me the most because it is as simple as communicated. You need to talk to her about this. Lay it all out there. This situation has gotten to this point because of both of you. Her taking advantage of not paying and you not putting your foot down and explaining she needs to contribute.
fatlogic,ff8nvji,t1_ff7b4zx,1579688010.0,I agree. Like she wants to lose weight to feel better. She is admitted that health at every size is bullshit but she doesn't want to attack an identity she has invested heavily in.

49ers,ff1t2tx,t3_er3n7k,1579485559.0,Question: is McKinnon eligible to return off IR and if so is he healthy enough to return of IR?
minnesotavikings,ff1gh04,t1_ff1en5w,1579478847.0,Well when they are talking 34 million a year price range. A rental year for 37 million isn't that bad. True though. I am still saying it is an option if they can't get a long term deal in place next offseason.
minnesotavikings,ff1aclh,t1_ff19y38,1579476832.0,He may not want to resign for less than over 30 million/year because of the new CBA up in the air.
minnesotavikings,ff18qm9,t1_ff0xng6,1579476371.0,If you can get him for 27 million a year or less I say go for it. But anymore you might as well not do it and have consideration for a 3rd time he gets franchised. Before it was no way it could happen but with how the cap is most likely going to increase a lot it is feasible option again. My problem with Cousins is he lack of ability to extend plays at all and he gets deer in headlights often when the pocket isn't clean and simply waits to be sacked. I just really hope we can improve the LG and LT for next season.
minnesotavikings,ff180z6,t1_ff10ify,1579476119.0,I will say it would make the Superbowl more interesting if they were in it. Because I don't hate the Chiefs or 49ers. I am cheering for Chiefs no matter what but if 49ers win it wouldn't bother me either.
minnesotavikings,fev6qdp,t1_feunwe3,1579393756.0,Zimmer is fired or contract not renewed.
nfl,fev3tgy,t3_eqlzpd,1579392799.0,Who the fuck leaves a game after one quarter?
minnesotavikings,fev3fi5,t3_eqnjiv,1579392649.0,"Even with the cap hell. Their is no reason for Vikings offense to regress next season unless the injury bug hits them. But yes the defense itself is in a rebuild season. Griffen, Rhodes, Joseph (maybe), Waynes, Alexander could all be gone. I do think Harris will be resigned. But outside of Griffen and Alexander they all underperformed this season too. I don't know if I buy that this team doesn't still have loads of talent. And if they improve that LG and LT spot on offense they could be a very dangerous offense to make up for the loss on the defense."
minnesotavikings,fev2ns2,t3_eqdtpm,1579392448.0,TIL I am old for already knowing this and slightly addicted to the Vikings.
relationships,feurkfj,t3_eqk7o2,1579389292.0,Just in general it is not the end of the world for you both to have personal leisure time without each other. Not only that it should be encouraged.
nfl,feuqu2r,t3_eqgrjd,1579389063.0,So they are both going to end up being Hall of Famers though right?
JurassicPark,femezf3,t1_femegrv,1579252022.0,No offense. But that's kind of on you there. If someone asked me that I would assume they would be up to date on the episodes and explain what is happening in the show instead of season/episode.
JurassicPark,fem5jag,t1_fem04hr,1579240500.0,Everyone ruined the red wedding for me. They didn't say what happened but it was easy to figure out what was going to happen.

todayilearned,feit3dm,t1_feimmid,1579146498.0,It allowed you to learn they weren't your friends. I am not well off at all. I couldn't imagine asking and in some of these people's cases expecting a handout. It is crazy.
todayilearned,feisud8,t1_feikjiz,1579146317.0,"This is a good way of explaining it. But if I was to win a good amount of money I would not have any problem footing the bill for dinner or bar tab. That isn't where lottery winners are sucked dry. It is the people stealing from them, beggars, and phony investment opportunities. And the thing is. I also have a unique ability to say no to things. I'd set a budget and give and allowance to my closest family and have again having no problem saying no to them for more. The only additional support to extended family I would consider is medical expenses and paying directly for the medical expenses."

todayilearned,feipuws,t3_epaqee,1579144241.0,They should absolutely be anonymous in the first place. I can't believe many places don't allow it because their argument is essentially transparency. But yet conspiracy theorists believe in crisis actors and crap. So how hard would it be for them to believe those people are pretending to have won the lottery? Way too much bad comes from making their names public.
nfl,feim1zx,t1_fegyoq5,1579141698.0,The more I read this thread the more baffling his name was even mentioned. I suppose he belongs in the Hall of Infamy.
nfl,feilp7u,t3_ep3g6t,1579141460.0,The more I think about it the more I feel Ozzie Newsome deserves to be in Hall of Fame again as an executive.
nfl,feilhv1,t3_ep3g6t,1579141317.0,Nevermind the move which was a big time dick move. Just the fact he fired Paul Brown who is probably the greatest coach of all-time IMO is enough to disqualify him from any honors. Then you can add in he fired Bill Belichick too. LOL! Wowzors!
nfl,feilb3j,t3_ep3g6t,1579141189.0,I don't really get why he would be Hall of Fame material. But I suppose I don't know enough. Nevermind the negatives about him. What are the positives about him to even be considered at all for this honor?
nfl,feiibqw,t1_fehp61i,1579139196.0,Exactly my first thought.

minnesotavikings,feie2sz,t3_eory5z,1579136353.0,I very much doubt Zimmer would simply accept a one-year extension. I think he should go on this lameduck season personally. Same with Cousins. And let the chips fall where they may.
minnesotavikings,feide5x,t1_fehwf2e,1579135893.0,He basically saved Alex Smith's career. Smith is looked at much differently after being coached by Harbaugh and Reid.
minnesotavikings,feidabb,t1_feht0c1,1579135821.0,I certainly would not be opposed to this at all either.
minnesotavikings,feid87d,t3_ep851v,1579135781.0,Josh Mcdaniels. I know BB coaching tree has not been great. Actually has been bad. But I do feel Mcdaniels might be the exception. He has experience as a Head coach and now has learned some more from BB.
minnesotavikings,feia66q,t3_eog5gv,1579133737.0,I do want to point out Moss's son was born before Moss rookie season. If it was after. I'd feel even older.

minnesotavikings,fei7f6c,t3_ep6h6g,1579131956.0,I feel it will be Gary or Klint Kubiak. Or Rick Dennison. Anyone outside of those 3 I will be a little surprised. But I do think we promote from within. Another darkhorse option could very well be Drew Petzing.

ChoosingBeggars,febsf6g,t1_febs7zq,1578962181.0,I agree. Just in general you don't deserve a discount. And if they do give one you should be thankful for it.

minnesotavikings,fdsfxqc,t1_fdsfl8w,1578701888.0,That's true. Peterson deserves some of the blame for not being coachable. But I do think he tried to listen to EB about patience. Peterson was not that style of runner at all. And he began dancing in the backfield and getting nothing trying to be patient. This is all of course speculation of what I saw. Perhaps I am wrong.
minnesotavikings,fdsb3e8,t1_fdoyt2p,1578698524.0,They put him on IV. I am sure he is getting much better treatment than you have with tamiflu. I just had a stomach bug on Tuesday and it went away in 24 hours. Freaking flu and stomach bug season. Ugh... Just glad it was quick recovery. I left work early at puked in my car while driving. That was fun.
minnesotavikings,fds7e5r,t1_fdrncng,1578696031.0,Yeah I really hope Kearse is back. It sucks not having Hughes or Alexander. But I do really like the option of Kearse out there. Props to Sendejo playing a lot of slot though. I was honestly think Harris would go into slot and have Sendejo at Safety.
minnesotavikings,fds78qu,t3_emudbr,1578695933.0,I just read a prediction that has the Vikings losing 45-6. I mean.... I am not going to lie if that happens I wouldn't be completely surprised because it is so Vikings-eque. But come on now. Predicting a 45-6 win in a playoff game is just silly. I don't care how bad you think one team is and how good you think the other team is.
