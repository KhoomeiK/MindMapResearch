cat,ff3zs0z,t1_ff3ypyi,1579552427.0,The most important thing is she has a good family to take care of her. Always glad to see a kitten being in good care.

TrueOffMyChest,fel2p1y,t1_fekxcui,1579212763.0,"In fact a lot of country (usually the own who used to colonise african countries) have their own version of this word, and it's often used as an insult."

AskReddit,fekujhn,t1_fekoezg,1579207886.0,"Same here. My sister and I used to share a room till I was 15, and she needed much more sleep than I did. So we usually had to go to bed by 8pm,   and I would read until I felt sleepy. When they thound out I was grounded from watching tv sunday mornings (the only time I could watch tv)."

unpopularopinion,fekdein,t3_eplpk5,1579197707.0,"This is truely an unpopular opinion for once, but it's very cute and wholesome. Never had acne, but you made me smile, thinking of all the people I know who had a real complex with that issue."

AmItheAsshole,feamt9t,t3_eoad3z,1578950391.0,"NAH I think she just see you as an old friend, and like you said is confortable in her body and maybe does't see any issue here. The only way you would be the asshole here, is if you would peep on her and fantasize about her. The way you told this story it doesn't seem so. Some people are confortable naked, some other aren't. And enjoyig a good looking view doesn't make you perv. If you were on a diet you would still see what's on menu in restaurant you like."
AmItheAsshole,feafik7,t3_eo9kg4,1578948085.0,"YTA If him having a girlfriend while sending you money bothered you so much, you should have blocked him from the beginning. Or accepted his money and not telling a soul, except your bf."
unpopularopinion,fe4ge7w,t1_fe4fsho,1578859061.0,"You're welcome, I can also add that it saves time when you're in a hurry! I'm not à morning person so I often brush my teeth in the shower too, 3 tasks in one !"
unpopularopinion,fe4f2jp,t3_enqz47,1578858610.0,"I don't see the problem, in fact it saves water so you save money and it's ecologic."
AmItheAsshole,fdwkq8k,t3_en99fw,1578759733.0,NTA no real friends would punch you in the face.
aww,fdsabke,t1_fds9rag,1578697998.0,"Don't worry, I feel the same about myself. Even my husband is just meh compared to her."
TwoXChromosomes,fds7r58,t3_emxbvo,1578696268.0,"Sometimes cats are the only ones you need (don't look at my username). Jokes aside, good for you, just do what makes you happy, and live you fullest life."
unpopularopinion,fds7d5a,t3_emxc5v,1578696012.0,"I agree with you, but don't see how this can be unpopular. Althought i see a lot of people doing that or speaking outlouds at their Phone with their highspeakers on, I really don't see how this is a thing. Who would want everyone to hear your conversation ? It remains a mystery to me."

TrueOffMyChest,fdr0t6d,t1_fdqwsf7,1578677923.0,"About reason 2: if someone is attracted to you with clothes, they're most likely to be attracted to you naked. And for number 1, as someone said before, loving yourself is the first step. It's easy to say, I know, but it's something you've got to work on. Don't give up !"

Sims4,fdkpb77,t3_elpg9h,1578508334.0,I would really like some sort of display/shelves made specifically for collectable items. I know there is one with In the jungle but I'm not à big fan of it. I have one sims I play with just to get all collections and I never know how to organize it properly without looking weird.
dogpictures,fcy37my,t1_fcy2e36,1578074136.0,"Yeah he deserves all the love he gets. Not my doggo, but I know he lived in a cage for 2 years with his previous owners, now he have 5 doggo and 3 cat friends, and lives a happy life."
