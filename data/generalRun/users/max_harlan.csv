Meditation,fevqf04,t3_eqf0yv,1579400253.0,"Awesome! I noticed the same thing from doing insight meditation and also the letting go practice that is in the book ""The untethered soul"" which is more or less just letting go of emotional responses to stuff until you get to the root of what you are feeling/reason why you are doing something."
BecomingTheIceman,fevq6de,t3_eqmmve,1579400155.0,"Yes! This is totally natural! 

I used to teach a breathing class (similar to holotropic breathing) and people would routinely laugh, cry, scream, have visions, etc. 

From what I understand of it, the super stimulated nervous system and the very relaxed muscles from breathing fully is what does it. 

Why? 

Nervous system stimulation from hyperventilation speeds up everything, heart rate, thoughts, etc. 

Relaxed muscles actually let us feel emotions more fully. Think of how when you are trying to hold emotions in how you actually get tight to numb the feeling. Well this happens over long periods of time too, we walk around chronically tight, chronically stuffing emotions down and when we finally relax and let down, all that old festering stuff comes out. 

TLDR you are totally normal and I hope that you enjoyed the catharsis."

Anxiety,fevosrq,t3_eqjipy,1579399750.0,"Hey, I had really intense anxiety a few years ago and come back to this subreddit occasionally as a way to pay it forward to those that helped me get over my anxiety back then. 

**Progressive exposure.** 

Get absolutely crystal clear about a few situations (like the phone one you mentioned) that make you anxious and then find ways to gradually expose yourself to more and more of the thing you don't like. You will build up a tolerance. 

Maybe the first time you go out, you take photos till one person looks your way and then you quit. Then you go out until 2 people look at you etc... maybe the culmination of all this is exclaiming out loud in a very busy city crowd how beautiful the city is while taking a photo and having 20+ people stare at you. 

**Stakes.**

Really dig into both the pain that you will experience by missing opportunities to do what you love and the pleasures that will be yours once you overcome your anxiety. Don't beat yourself up, just be factual. Maybe write it down and hang it on your mirror so you remember what you are aiming at. 

**Lifestyle.**

Drop caffeine, social media, porn, any drug, and alcohol use. Take up intense exercise 3-5 times a week and meditation. Maybe take Ashwagandha or other supplements that help sooth and balance your hormones. 

All this doesn't fix anxiety, but it does take the edge off a little which helps you do the real harder work of facing your anxiety bit by bit. 

Keep your head up OP, I'm rooting for you, I had it as bad as you from the sounds of it, and now I live a mostly anxiety-free existence."
Nootropics,fevnhwl,t3_eqowyj,1579399357.0,COMPLETELY AGREED! I take ashwagandha and meditate (not an anxiolytic but still reduces anxiety) and can say that these two make more difference for me than any substance except potentially Alpha GPC.
Drugs,fevnbeh,t3_eqgeve,1579399284.0,"Man, that is a terrible way to handle it. 

First, it is like you are being penalized for doing the right thing. 

Second, they are being incredibly irrational about it by claiming to know that you are high despite your willingness to prove them wrong in the most intense way possible. 

Third, it seems like they don't know that your girlfriend is also an adult responsible for her own actions. 

Keep your head up OP, maybe make your relationship and life together incredible as a way to stick it to them ;)"
Feminism,fevmawe,t1_ferdtte,1579399040.0,Exactly. There are harsh legal penalties that can lead to a man peeing in public being marked a sex offender for indecent exposure in some cases. So this post might be emotional based on some hypothetical cultural norm but the legal consequences are waaaaaaaayyyyyy harsher against men.

awakened,fevjzee,t3_eqi7l7,1579398270.0,"In the dichotomy you gave, aliens are a hell of a lot more likely than ""god"" in the traditional sense. 

However, I think that the most likely scenario is that gods/god just serve as a way to dramatize and share the deepest insights about our own consciousness and a primitive understanding of the natural world.

You could take the approach of rewiring your brain to find fitness attractive, or to no longer have the same feelings around fat. 

Often this is done by finding the formative experiences that led to your fat fetish and then changing the associations of them. 

I know it can work for you because I used to be a Certified Hypnotherapist and because I have heard that once, a woman was hypnotized to have more feeling and sensitivity and a fetish for anal. This was an immoral use of hypnotherapy but the principle is the same."
