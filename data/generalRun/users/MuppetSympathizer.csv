psychologystudents,fectfn4,t1_fecoqyv,1578983924.0,"What was your path from Psych to UX research? I'm seriously leaning towards this route but feel underprepared for the work with just the Psych BA. I'm considering a master's program in HCI but it's insanely competitive, expensive, and seems to be more geared towards the design side of UX."

HumansBeingBros,fdj3fqp,t1_fdj21az,1578457415.0,"Being kind to dogs =/= being kind to humans. Animals and children can have an inherent awareness of the current intention of others, what is called theory of mind. In other words, they can tell who will treat *them* kindly. But that does not translate to knowing if that person is morally righteous in other areas, at other times, or with other people. I'm sure Hitler's dogs thought he was a pretty cool dude."

nonononoyes,fcmo4c3,t1_fcmdwsf,1577783828.0,"Best way to counter the bystander effect is by leading the action to help, which these two guys did. Public displays of prosocial action encourages others to behave in kind. Their initiative likely influenced the people in the cars behind who were in a position to help the victim driver while these guys stopped the hit-and-run driver. Two big fundamental principles behind the bystander effect are normative and informative social influence: we look to those around us to see how everyone else is acting (normative), and we look to those who seem like they know what they're doing (informative). Since these two guys took it upon themselves to help, it's very likely that those behind did the same. Faith in humanity restored."
