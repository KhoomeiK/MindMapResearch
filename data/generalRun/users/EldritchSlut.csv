TooAfraidToAsk,ff8n386,t3_es9ss2,1579686804.0,Been at it for almost a decade now. We ended up rubbing off on each other and meeting in the middle. Smartest choice I've ever made was dating my SO.
depression,ff8mhb2,t3_es9c4c,1579685861.0,"I started taking medication to help with my anxiety and depression, it helped a lot, but have me the most vivid insane nightmares of my life. Several times I'd wake up screaming, or feeling like I'd been running. I got one of those THC cartridges and started hitting on that right before bed (not a big fan of the high feeling), and it knocks me out with no dreams. Maybe you should look into it. Even if it's just CBD. Also shrooms can help a lot, there seems to be some science backing the use of shrooms too."

suggestmeabook,ff2kusd,t3_erapnb,1579510834.0,"Cows by Matthew Stokoe. I don't of it was because it acted as a palate cleanser or if it was just interesting to see a book that broke down the rules of writing, similar to Lynch or Jodorowsky. I don't even think I would call it a ""good"" book but it was interesting and did something for me. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys transgressive fiction."

books,fdxjdeu,t3_enbfiz,1578769218.0,"I just read Stephen King's The Institute and I'm betting it's right for you. It was like his take on a young adult novel.

The Wheel of Time series might be for you too. It's kind of like Lord of the Rings, but the writer doesn't spend 20 pages describing someone's cloak. 

The Dark Tower is another amazing series, IF you can get past the first book. 

THE book that moved me away from teen or YA books was Jurassic Park, I love this book, even the sequel. I read them about once a year. It's just a well done story, with just enough information to make it seem plausible, and enough sci-fi and social commentary to keep me interested.

Edit: and how could I forget DUNE? Dune is basically the foundation for a lot of the popular YA books out today."
AskMen,fdufk73,t3_en51wn,1578732365.0,"I get like this when my anxiety is through the roof, I feel like an asshole after. In my head it's like there's a disassociation from emotion, like; I don't care what happened to you today. I don't want to hear your voice and I don't want to see your face. I want you to not exist and I'm going to treat you as if you don't. I just want to sit here and zone out.

I don't think someone who isn't interested in a relationship is someone who's ""emotionally unavailable"" though."
minimalism,fdueley,t3_en4w4s,1578731956.0,"Everything is a fucking advertisment anymore. I was watching the ball drop in times square online and friends were talking about how beautiful it was. Seriously? Everyone is wearing a hat that has an ad on it. Every building is lit up with ads. Then we have to watch the commercial breaks so that we can hear the host talk about products that people are wearing. 

Now you can't even pump fuel without hearing an ad that's 5x's too loud. My local fucking funeral home has a bright 6'x4' LED sign out front showing ads for local places and in small print under the ads, who died this week and when the next funeral is. 

My new 40"" tv, which I thought was too much TV for me but it was only $100, came with ads. I had to go into the menu and turn them off. What the fuck. You can't escape it, even with adblock online most sites that I'm interested in force you to turn off adblock so you can see their stupid shit. Next time I see a meteor or something radioactive I'm going to run at it in the hopes it'll give me some kind of superpower that makes advertising around me stop."

AskMen,fdpw8lq,t3_emnv9i,1578643095.0,I like these first person perspective videos of people mountain biking in trails. I don't have the energy to do it but it's fun to watch.
AskMen,fdpw543,t3_emmweq,1578642975.0,"Helicoptering their dicks, measuring pubic hair length, the toilet stalls didn't have doors and people would watch each other shit, twice a kid let other kids shove a toothbrush up his ass, had our female gym teacher in there all the time, dude got his dick stuck in a shampoo bottle he was trying to fuck, naked wrestling, I could go on but I really hated high school."
depression,fdpv1v0,t3_emnbdm,1578641657.0,"Are you not okay with an open marriage? If not a divorce may be the best option. Sometimes people change and want different things while others dont. My life seems to be one set back after another, I'm still learning how to roll with the punches, but it's getting easier with help. Sounds like therapy could help you a lot too.

AskRedditAfterDark,fdjechv,t3_elozxs,1578467268.0,"I mean, I you want to have sex with her she's basically asking you to ask her. Likely she's just scared of the future and commitment. If you're okay with possible ruining a marriage for sex go for it. If you don't want to do that then don't. 

Just by posting here it seems like you want someone to tell you it's okay to have sex with her. That sounds like you think it's wrong to go through with it."

AskMen,fdjdp50,t3_elp4sm,1578466536.0,"Unfortunately it's rare for either gender to see someone else as more than a friend once they are friended. We tend to think of friends as family, that's how they're going to look at you. 

Best thing you can do for both of you is to ghost him and move on. You'll find someone else and probably someone better. If you NEED to know, you can tell him how you feel, maybe you're that rare case where it works out, but it's unlikely. Don't waste your life on someone who isn't in love with you."
suggestmeabook,fddb3f7,t3_ekofi2,1578303481.0,"The Willows is a great atmospheric horror, which sounds up your alley but it's super short. You could good a series of his books, Wendigo, Willows, and Camp. 

It's campy in a good way but I really enjoyed Wayward Pines trilogy. Reminded me a bit of Southern Reach but more scares. 

Birdbox was a lot better than the movie too, it's A LOT like the Thing, if you like the internal fighting.

I'll come back with more later."

It's cheap, it's e-ink so the display is great day or night, the battery life lasts at least a month and I read daily, and you can put your own books on it if you don't like their marketplace. I went from 12 books in 2018 to 34 in 2019 and a lot has to do with the Paperwhite."
depression,fddak9m,t3_ekrb8y,1578302671.0,"I felt the same while I was in school. I found that most teachers won't bother you if you're reading a book. I did the minimum to keep AB honor roll but everything else I used books to escape where I was, got the idea from a documentary about prison actually. 

And you don't have to go to college. There's so many trades out there you can find something you enjoy, and probably make more money with, AND it'll probably have great job security. 

None of this will fix your anxiety though, maybe make you feel better for awhile, but it'll come back."
