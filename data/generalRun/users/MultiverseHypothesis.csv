'Excuse' sounds like a pre-incidental justification that goes through your head, which assumes you have the ability to think clearly about things. When we're in the heat of the moment and getting really angered, we don't.

Perhaps 'reasonable/force justifiable /reaction' is a better way of putting it, since that sounds more fitting in the post-incidental judgment and analysis of events.
