thatHappened,ff6fz44,t1_ff6cyao,1579626366.0,It’s literally something that reacts with moisture. Leon Lush did a YT video on it. He poured water over one and it got all green and disgusting looking. Lol “toxins”
thatHappened,ff5thnl,t3_ert8kw,1579609642.0,Lol “detox baths”
progresspics,ff1vij9,t3_er0ke0,1579487113.0,I love the placement of your raven
niceguys,feud3bg,t3_eqk5l9,1579385388.0,I too am constantly approached by strangers that tell me where I rank on an imaginary scale that is only used by a small group of insecure douches
niceguys,feqn7yx,t1_feortdy,1579343834.0,He doesn’t look Indian in his profile pic..

tinderstories,fea8014,t1_fea2l49,1578945436.0,It’s GucciBerry!
niceguys,fe6a9s5,t3_emw253,1578885312.0,"Like dude you’ve already shown how disingenuously fake you are with your “tbh I don’t even expect a conversation. Just wanted to tell you you’re beautiful. Take care” 

“WHY WONT YOU TALK TO ME?”"
My600lbLife,fe5u5uf,t3_emgw1m,1578875012.0,Does she shoot these videos on a Motorola Razr?
My600lbLife,fe5t8o8,t1_fdq8y7i,1578874431.0,I laughed so hard at this my abs hurt. Then I went on to her YT and the first two videos’ thumbnails are just her giant head. I can’t stop laughing.
My600lbLife,fe5rxwa,t1_fdyhur1,1578873646.0,I think the hospital visits are because she has figured out how to game the system for a place to stay that is paid for by insurance. She stays in cheap motels then back in the hospital always near the same time each month.
My600lbLife,fdzqdwt,t3_enc44p,1578793379.0,Dis munt!
gatekeeping,fdqgdse,t1_fdqeyg5,1578665995.0,I remember that! Torrid is where I get my nice business work clothes now but I remember it basically being a plus size hot topic before
My600lbLife,fdkvstf,t1_fdjxvtx,1578512188.0,Yeah I’ve heard the surgery alone is often over 10k in the U.S.
My600lbLife,fdjrc4x,t1_fdjjzre,1578484579.0,"Is the surgery much cheaper in Mexico? I have no health insurance so I’ve always thought surgery wouldn’t be an option, but I never thought of that"
My600lbLife,fddejws,t1_fdcwamk,1578308640.0,He is I believe. They’ve made a few social media posts about each other. But he’s very open about being “with” Karina.
bigdickproblems,fdabhgv,t1_fd9c5bf,1578244135.0,Most women aren’t nearly as focused on dicks as men (that sounds funny lol). Especially women who are looking for relationships. I think the instances in which a woman will pass completely on guy due to a large dick are slim to none— and even if it did happen I don’t think it would be because she views him as a “toy” but more so worried about painful sex long term.
bigdickproblems,fdab6ft,t3_ekc3ju,1578243996.0,I think it just depends on the person. I’ve been with someone very large. Sex was often painful and we had to make adjustments but it was worth it because I loved him. I’ve also been with someone very small and we just worked with other ways he satisfied me.
bigdickproblems,fdaadqo,t3_ek9ecg,1578243646.0,I wonder how that stereotype even got started. I think it’s ridiculous.
My600lbLife,fda88x5,t1_fcozu19,1578242874.0,He also gained 100s of lbs in that time so he was literally eating all day every day
My600lbLife,fda81zc,t3_ehy2it,1578242791.0,"I hate when people think they have some reason to comment on what they don’t find physically attractive on other people. If you’re not dating the person, what does it matter? People do this and then try to get others to join in on ridiculing people. It’s not constructive or helpful in any way."
My600lbLife,fda7e9y,t1_fclpnlz,1578242629.0,Rice is okay if it’s fried!
My600lbLife,fda61rd,t3_ei0lr6,1578242189.0,"This may have been mentioned already (I didn’t read all the comments) but many of them are also addicted to pain medication. This would not change the volume, but would decrease the frequency and likely make the stool more solid (pain pills cause constipation) - so it MIGHT not be as messy as a normal person would be."
My600lbLife,fda57yb,t1_fct32of,1578241833.0,She did.
My600lbLife,fda4z6b,t1_fcwkpwy,1578241746.0,Also she said her last straw was physical abuse and he spit on her and destroyed her belongings in her home.
My600lbLife,fda4nsp,t3_ej42i4,1578241606.0,"This prob won’t be a popular answer, but I think Charlie (Nicole’s fiancé). They were pretty dysfunctional, but he was, for the most part, supportive of Nicole."
My600lbLife,fda4e2p,t3_ejj8zq,1578241490.0,My mom always used to teeter between “yeah I know I made mistakes but I’ve forgiven myself” and “I don’t recall doing that”
creepyPMs,fd9ygj2,t3_eiwhk6,1578239589.0,What pictures does this weirdo think he’s threatening you with?
tinderstories,fd9ex4b,t3_ek2li5,1578232475.0,This is either weirdest match ever or the guy is super pro at getting girls to leave and never call him so he doesn’t have to. Lol
My600lbLife,fd2nayp,t1_fcywt96,1578149664.0,It could have been the Sean Milliken episode as well
niceguys,fd2guku,t3_ejoceg,1578147028.0,This guy definitely engages in flagellation
My600lbLife,fcys0dq,t1_fcwkpju,1578085838.0,Yeah you know them because they are your neighbor - well enough to keep phone contact but don’t know where they live? Good point.
My600lbLife,fcvr66s,t1_fcu4k4s,1578008244.0,"I realize people want these updates but it seems like a crappy thing for this person to post their personal business like this. Imagine a family member dying and the neighbor you ask to check on the situation goes online talking about it - complete with judgmental comment about your dogs/home. I realize they agreed to go on a show, but this seems more intrusive and not okay to me."
