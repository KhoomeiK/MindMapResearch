You acknowledged her apology. That doesn't need to mean everything is fine. The way she reacted tells us she isn't really sorry. NTA.

AmItheAsshole,felt4ht,t3_epnbxq,1579230278.0,"im gonna go with NTA just because of how they reacted to you. Yes it is a difficult time but they should also understand your predicament. Personally, I'm of the opinion that you should be able to go for the wedding or the funeral and not be guilted for either. Also, the wedding has been planned for ages and the funeral was sudden. Also, the wedding is for someone who is alive. That said, funerals are really for the people left behind so i understand being there for the family. 

I'm sorry you were put in this situation. Good luck."
