Nootropics,ffbdx21,t1_ffb58ck,1579761186.0,"It takes longer to process strong trauma, so you need to do it up to several times. And you may take some time to recover, but in the end it will work for you. Just be patient and dont blame yourself for anything that happened. After all, people, even the evil ones, do the best they can based on their own life experiences. Dont make the mistake of thinking that people are happy just because they look that way."
Nootropics,ff9obaw,t1_ff9fhsu,1579717183.0,"This is a pretty simple thing to explain, but it can be complicated to fully understand. So there is a lot to be said about this.

Your mind has its own way of processing negative experiences, and it does it almost automatically. The only downside is that it makes you feel really bad while its happening. Its basically trying to bring negative experiences up to your consciousness, and with it, negative feelings associated with the  experiences, so that it can finally let go of them. But the problem is that you are afraid of accepting these experiences. Every time you remember doing something stupid you’ll automatically reason with it, or avoid it, in order to turn it away from you. You completely disown these parts of yourself so that you dont have to feel bad about it (because you have been conditioned to think that you should). And when you do that you dont let your mind process it. You must know that most of your mind works subconsciously. That means you dont actually decide a whole lot going on inside. You just observe and decide how to act with it. 

So you try to push all these emotions away. But there is a very deep reason for it. And that is because, as children, we are (mostly all) conditioned by our parents  and society to think that if we do something wrong, we arent good enough. And that if we do something good, we’re good enough.

How this works is that as a child, evolutionarily speaking, we rely a hundred percent on our parents to take care of us, or else we die. This means that we rely heavily on knowing that our parents love us so that they dont leave us. Now when your parents then get angry with you for doing something «wrong», it subconsciously translates into «they dont love me when I do this». So you stop doing that thing in order to please them. Now the problem with this is that if you think you have to do something to be good enough, you automatically assume that youre not already good enough. And when you assume that youre not already good enough, you can never truly be good enough. So it doesnt matter what you do because its all a foundation built on top of the fact that youre not good enough. This is why so many people just work and work to become millionaires, only to find out it didnt make their problems go away, and they end up very depressed thinking theres something wrong with their brains. 

Ok so back to releasing. Just sit with yourself and do nothing. You will feel a negative emotion starting to arise. Your natural instinct now will be to start thinking about something else or find something to focus on so you dont have to listen to yourself. This time you embrace this feeling. You want to feel bad. With it comes a memory and all of a sudden youre reliving something traumatic that happened in the past. It doesnt even have to be something old, as we collect new experiences every day. You may start worrying about something in the future, which is a bit different to handle because you can actually fix that by reasoning with yourself. These traumatic experiences dont have to be anything you consider terrible, being in a position that makes you feel bad is enough.

So when you start living these experiences you find that the feeling becomes very strong. But eventually it disappears, and after it does it may still come back to you in the future, but it wont bring a negative emotion. What may happen is you even manage to see a fun perspective on it and you end up laughing, as have happened to me many times. Now just remember that this is a difficult task to do. You have spent your whole life running away from this because these experiences made you feel like you werent good enough, thus raising your fear of death. Its all about acceptance. Can you accept what happened to you? Can you accept being a loser for the rest of your life? Can you accept never finding love? These are thoughts that trigger most people, but its only their fear of them that keep them real. If youre afraid of not being confident, it makes you unconfident. So releasing that fear is the only step you can make.

The worry you have about making these feelings stronger so that they turn into bigger problems is just a fear that is completely natural. 

So the number one mistake in parenting is to yell and get mad at children for doing the wrong things. There is in reality no such thing as something wrong. A child will understand what to do and what not to do simply if its told, and can understand why. But unfortunately most parents act this way when «raising» their children.

There is also a problem around the term raising children. A child should not be raised. You raise sheep and cows, you dont raise a child. You have to cultivate a child, like you would with a plant. You give it good conditions to grow, but you can never decide in which color it will bloom. Parents try to turn their children into something they think is good, without listening to them. This also is a part that makes people believe they have to change, and this fuels insecurity.

This is a lot to digest but believe me I have been reflecting upon this for years now along with reading a lot of well reknown books.

Feel free to ask any questions

Edit: Remember to also look for triggers that make you feel uncomfortable. Like if you meet a sertain type of person, etc. And gather those triggers. It’ll be easier to find the causes and dive into them."
Nootropics,ff9839m,t1_ff92lqb,1579707024.0,"Past trauma that you havent processed will make you feel worse and drugs make you feel better. Its pretty simple, not as complicated as you think. Even if you «forget» past trauma its still going to be in the subconscious parts of the brain. And your neurological pathways are still going to come from pathways containing trauma, which dictates the way your brain works today.

So what we all need to get better at is releasing trauma."
