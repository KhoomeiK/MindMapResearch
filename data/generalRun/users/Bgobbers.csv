Although I’m definitely not fond of HA so far, her lines in that conversation seemed like they were well rehearsed. Almost like she knew drama was a possibility on the show and had predetermined what she would say is she was confronted by someone. She probably should have consulted a friend on bringing some human info her canned responses."

She references using the Brami lupini beans, but I find that those are better for snacking since they're more expensive and are specially flavored. 

I get my lupini beans in bulk from [here](https://www.amazon.com/Joycie-Ready-Lupini-Beans-Pack/dp/B07TH9LZ2R/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=lupini+beans&qid=1579271963&sr=8-8).

This recipe makes 4 servings, but I've found also that if you double, triple, or quadruple the recipe, you can make a larger loaf that can be easily sliced for sandwich-type setian. But if you increase the recipe volume, just make sure to cook it for much longer. I recently did a 4x batch, and I adjusted the cook time to 25 minutes covered, 30 minutes uncovered, then another hour to hour and a half tightly wrapped in tin foil.

Enjoy!"

fatlogic,fdvx9s6,t1_fdukwrn,1578752758.0,"My husband is the same way, and it’s actually really great. I complain about how I feel fat, and he will give the appropriate reassurances. But when it comes down to it, he has an amazing sense of self control and says “if you don’t like how you look, then eat less”. 

I can totally imagine how people with a SO that does support their goals could lead to a downward spiral."
