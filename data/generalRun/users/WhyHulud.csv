Well no shit. What do you want, a 15-year, 45-page plan for the economic redevelopment of Clairton? This is Reddit.

>There is no sure-fire template

There is, you're just trying too hard to fill it in with the details. They need to diversify the industries and businesses there. What those should look like are the hard part, and I have neither the knowledge or salary for that.

>Clairton is not East Liberty

Again, no shit. *East Liberty was no East Liberty* just a few years ago. When I would volunteer at ARL a decade ago I never thought things would get better there. And those ""bros"" bring a fuckton of money to the area, try getting a place in parts of Garfield (gentrification is another issue for another post, could we stick to this).

>Nobody actually has any real solutions for redeveloping those sorts of places, other than letting them rot and having residents move to greener pastures.

Other cities have addressed this with property law, like Youngstown. Derelict lots aren't allowed to rot; the city contacts the owner and if they don't resolve it, they're bulldozed.

You're right, it's not an easy issue to fix, but it's already been solved elsewhere."

Yes, brown paper is mostly recyclable, but the cost in terms of energy for recyclable is about 60-80% of the original virgin cost. That cost is much greater than plastics, when normalized for mass, and even greater when you compare for units produced.

>I don’t think recycled plastic can be used effectively in single use plastic bags, I’m pretty sure those are almost always virgin plastic

True. Most of those bags are BOPP (biaxially oriented polypropylene), and the issue with recycling PP or polyethylene (PE) is the additives for color, resistivity, etc. But even considering this, we can make *many, many* more plastic bags with the same amount of resources. And every tree that's cut down is longer sequestering carbon! 

The problem is not solved with paper. The problem is solved with durable plastics and recycling what we use now."
