raisedbynarcissists,ff78gr4,t1_ff71yjy,1579643187.0,"That's very strong of you. Luckily we both seem to have had step dads being able to step up to the job. Most of the insecurities I battled through my youth came from the messed up relationship to him.  
But I owe none of the accomplishments I made to him, that's the main takeaway for me - I managed to make something out of myself with a horrible father figure trying to weigh me down all along.  

I just felt so angry when he tried to blame me today for not telling him about my life when he never cares to ask. Our phone calls after 6 months of no contact were 5 minutes long at most.. It's all for the better I guess 

His mother is the exact same, so I'm glad to hit two birds with one stone on that one. Thank you!"
