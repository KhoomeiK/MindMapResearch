Though in proper context one assumes an understanding that the comparison is relative to current events within decades rather than centuries, or at least that's been my experience."

Mindfulness,fdgjb13,t1_fded4bq,1578399112.0,"There is some truth to it, no doubt. But I think it does us no favors to pretend we are all powerful creators. There are many things outside of our control, and that's OK. All the more reason to focus on what you can control, though that's no guarantee you will become who you ultimately aspire to be."

 Don't forget they Have the best QB  coach combo when it comes to not losing to the same team twice in a season, the definition of masters of revenge.

 Counting out the Pat's is what fake fans do"

Patriots,fcuz74h,t1_fcuwc61,1577991440.0,"To be sure it's a continuum, and other teams have had it worse, no one is claiming otherwise. I guess the way I see it we have been dealing with injuries, they have not been healthy, period, even if they play, being injured, missing practice, has an effect. Pretending injuries haven't effected the team is madness."
Patriots,fcuvsxh,t1_fcuviim,1577989558.0,Oh and we also put Gunner on IR back in November

Awwducational,fcnsbv6,t1_fcnlfvl,1577817480.0,"You can certainly hedge your statements, problem is most high school science teachers are very dogmatic, they don't question their own assumptions or those of their professors, they repeat the same curriculum given to them instead of thinking for themselves and teaching their students to do the same."
Awwducational,fcnr634,t1_fcnmpzv,1577816883.0,Assuming the genetic heritage of animals when there is clearly missing information is absolutely disingenuous.
Awwducational,fcneq2i,t1_fcn3tgs,1577810198.0,"I want scientists to be less dogmatic, that starts with teaching people the difference between theories supported by strong evidence and conjecture based on scanty evidence."
Awwducational,fcmzogf,t1_fcmwj59,1577798883.0,"Perhaps in the fine print.. seems the way science is taught is highly disingenuous, asserting theory as fact without any skeptical discussion, the media perpetuates this notion hence we have so-called-adults who are completely unaware of the blindspots installed by their parent culture."
