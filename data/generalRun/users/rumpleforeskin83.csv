Warframe,ffijgpo,t3_etnhmv,1579975330.0,For the same reason I need to scroll left and right to trade in cores (or bonds in fortuna) when you could easily fit probably 50 different trade in items on the screen at once but instead it's all just wasted space for no reason.
Warframe,ffihrxd,t1_ffi0rgz,1579974179.0,"It's not that host migrations happen, it's that they have like a 50% chance of entirely breaking the game and you lose everything from the mission."
news,ffid1q7,t1_fficssq,1579970973.0,"I feel like an idiot now ha, I had no idea a heated sidewalk was a thing, I thought they meant it got hot from an electrical short.

Makes a lot more sense now. Was so confused as to how a short to ground from buried cables would cause either situation."
Warframe,ffi99tj,t1_ffi4dwj,1579968370.0,I'm glad item labels are off by default but honestly I think the icons are just as distracting and unnecessary. When I open my inventory it should just be a clean empty screen with everything invisible and require hovering over in an attempt to find things.
news,ffi8sol,t1_ffi595u,1579968033.0,"Just how hot was this sidewalk, and how on Earth did neither you nor the dog notice it was being cooked alive?

Edit : apparently heated sidewalks are a thing, had no idea and misunderstood the whole thing."
worldnews,ff4b0h4,t1_ff47pau,1579559426.0,"Not always fast, which makes it even worse."
LivestreamFail,ff1e6hb,t1_fezikj5,1579478050.0,That's from the sweetener I think. I can chug regular ones or coffee and no ill effects but that sugar free stuff messes my guts up bad.
Warframe,fez8ejn,t1_feyj4q6,1579454775.0,You don't need a slow to 1 phase all the heads.
Warframe,fez7nxj,t1_fez62oj,1579454533.0,Oh boy you're in for a shock lol. Lots of frames have absolutely useless abilities.
LivestreamFail,fellsqp,t1_felhwv7,1579225233.0,"It's a pasta as old as the gods.

Although always just as hilarious as it is disturbing."
4chan,fedby10,t1_feda3wj,1579007069.0,Aren't they mostly depressed and upset by default?
todayilearned,feax9it,t1_feaj6aw,1578953148.0,"Just gg or something. 

GG EZ is somewhat  toxic or bad manners (debatable yes, don't flame me), it's taken sort of sarcastic as in ""good game...for our side, you're so bad it was easy/effortless"""
PrequelMemes,fdzthof,t1_fdzspr6,1578795423.0,"He was 19. 9 when they met, didn't meet again till 10 years later."
todayilearned,fdw7qr1,t1_fdvsert,1578755935.0,You garnish it up nice and can't even tell.
TumblrInAction,fdsend6,t1_fdschtx,1578700962.0,"I was about to say the same, here they just park right in the streets lol. The police and parking people don't bother them but I would bet they'd bother random cars (I know they're marked but still) though."
science,fdscggs,t1_fds2swn,1578699443.0,I've been accused of being an electrician many times due to a bag full of Klein tools. Though to be fair HVAC is about 60% electrical work and 40% plumbing/pipefitting mostly lol.
UpliftingNews,fdnp1ts,t1_fdng4qq,1578590223.0,RIP Harambe
EscapefromTarkov,fdlcidb,t1_fdkvye5,1578521094.0,Those and the crates that the lid closes on its own get me every time.
7daystodie,fdkxayn,t1_fdk2v6j,1578513072.0,"Right, but we're talking about wondering hordes right now."
todayilearned,fdh8jry,t1_fdh5sug,1578417709.0,"You can still do all that, arguably easier and safer than ever. Just takes more effort than the first search result."
TumblrInAction,fdh2e9l,t1_fdgnzof,1578413904.0,The anus butcher of Blaviken.
trashy,fd5fj1v,t1_fd5d0pm,1578177136.0,"They'd start using Hollywood accounting where nobody actually makes any money through the magic of number and accounting fuckery.

Edit : I forgot they just don't make ""profit""  but you could still fine them based on revenue, which is a good idea indeed. Thanks to all the replies for pointing this out to me."
gifs,fcvop61,t1_fcvjnw8,1578006666.0,"Welcome to Reddit. Everything (especially on the defaults) is an ad, a repost, or both. It's not nearly as organic as it's meant to seem."
UpliftingNews,fcuwp6u,t1_fculfhz,1577990057.0,"I'd 100% be dead by now if I wasn't paranoid about this, the number of people I've seen blow through reds going full speed is staggering."
ARK,fcs9ts9,t1_fcs9c3m,1577913504.0,"Right now just trap them, lol.

Somewhere on here a dev commented they're looking into a way to make them bola-able despite their new drag weight I think."
ARK,fcs8uw3,t3_eiltux,1577913089.0,They upped their drag weight and you can't bola them anymore.
interestingasfuck,fcnc766,t1_fcn7iu2,1577808546.0,The extremely rapid expansion of gas from water boiling when thrown into hot oil causes an explosion of hot oil to go everywhere. Rather violently depending on the amount.
interestingasfuck,fcn7fcu,t1_fcn66bp,1577805227.0,I'd guess it exploded.
news,fcl81kn,t1_fcl1upw,1577741815.0,Training a bunch of glorified security guards sure sounds like the most hardass of all hardass jobs.
videos,fc9cn81,t1_fc95n56,1577550588.0,Dirt is free though
todayilearned,fc93z4z,t1_fc8xgh7,1577546654.0,They do look a bit different from each other lol.
