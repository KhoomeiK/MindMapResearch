EyeFloaters,fff2j2z,t3_et53y2,1579873950.0,"Yes, and hyperacusis also :/ My tinnitus is moderate at worst though......sometimes mild/moderate. I'd much rather get rid if the floaters."
EyeFloaters,fedo1ub,t1_feciuco,1579016156.0,My anxiety from them is getting worse even though i try to tell myself they are irrelevant.
depression,fe8l7wx,t3_eo1usb,1578927435.0,"I am on part disabiliy and can only work 10 hours a week due to chronic depression and anxiety. I don't care what anybody thinks. If they knew what it was like being in my shoes they wouldnt trade for a second. My best advice to you: screw those people, they are not worthy of your time!"
EyeFloaters,fe39cit,t3_enpch0,1578847175.0,I have floaters in both eyes. Both my eyes are effected equally bad. Like I have the same amount/severity on both eyes. it's weird.
EyeFloaters,fe1g6wh,t1_fe14fmm,1578826164.0,"Id take light sensitivity in substitute for relief from floaters. And it's not like your eyes will become permently sensitive to light. If one finds the light sensitivity to get too bothersome, then just train your eyes to more light again, and the sensitivity will go away again."
EyeFloaters,fdvtpoh,t3_en7c4d,1578751358.0,For me it's the opposite way around. Mine are usually a bit worse upon waking.
EyeFloaters,fdv4aoy,t1_fdv3bya,1578743062.0,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5727722/

91,5% were satisfied with the surgery outcome.

Yeah, I'm the stupid one, lol."
EyeFloaters,fdv3mot,t1_fdv3bya,1578742755.0,Likewise to you on that first sentence. bye bye.
EyeFloaters,fdv30sm,t1_fdv2sav,1578742624.0,Seriously. take your shit elsewhere. You are going on ignore very soon.
EyeFloaters,fdv2wnh,t1_fdv23wn,1578742562.0,"And don't you go spreading fear mongering around! You never hear about the good cases cause when FOV is succesful people don't want to look back. I know if mine is, i'll never tell about it.

And lol, to that last sentence. You have  done nothing else then try to convince me otherwise."
EyeFloaters,fdv1y9x,t1_fdv1svn,1578742265.0,You did not just write that. How clueless are you? I already stated in my post that that's been tried thoughoutly.
EyeFloaters,fdut4le,t1_fdsibv6,1578738401.0,"Come on! He still does not have an interest in ruining peoples eye. If that was what happened to a lot of people, do you really think he would still be in buisness? that anybody doing FOV would be in buisness? Of course not! 
And you are false on the cataract. Yes, they will form at some point for everybody, but it can take longer then 3 years for sure. I've spoken to a couple of people who had FOV that still didnt have cataract after 5 years.
Again: don't do the FOV if you don't want to, but don't tell me what to do or not to do!"
EyeFloaters,fdusdde,t1_fdsmegg,1578738055.0,"Great, make an anxious person even more anxious. Ridiculous to refer to 1 bad case.  Listen, I get it.......you don't think the FOV is worth it, but that doesnt mean everybody else has to think the same. My life is slowly going down the gutter and I know eventually all I will be able to do is sit in darkness when the floaters get bad enough, and by then my life will be total misery and I will be left with 2 options: suicide or FOV. So you still think the FOV is a bad choice in that case?? And don't give me that therapy, medication and just learning to accept them advice, It's tried throuhoutly.......and it aint working for me. You have to accept that for some all the therapy and medication and willpower in the world is not sufficient."
depression,fdur3u8,t1_fdssvxj,1578737678.0,"Maybe I should have written I'm not new this. I've done the therapy countless times and medication, and it's hasnt worked for me. Although I've never spoken to a therapist about not wanting to get better."
depression,fduqymf,t1_fdtvcet,1578737614.0,Have been fighting back 20+ years. It aint working.
EyeFloaters,fdpz2t2,t3_emg57x,1578646804.0,"Best of luck to you. There is of course a risk but it is small. I'd rely on the doctor's words any day (the one who does this surgery regurlaly then people online who only focus on the bad cases. obviously the doctor is not interested in messing up your eye/eyes, so he wouldnt do the surgery if the risk wasnt very low."
EyeFloaters,fdofw6p,t3_em23g2,1578604321.0,I think you forgot to attach a picture or link?
EyeFloaters,fdofnso,t1_fdn8hhi,1578604186.0,"NO WAY is f.Lux making your eye sight worse. Something else is causing this. If anything, reducing blue light is good for your eyes."
EyeFloaters,fdjq91v,t1_fdiaq63,1578483247.0,"Crossing the street isnt safe - you could get hit and disabled for life

Driving is not safe - SO many people are killed every year

Point is, there are risks to EVERYTHING is this life. It is up to us to decide if the possible benefit outweights the risk. And if my life is destroyed because of floaters and I am in so much misery and ready to kill myself because of it, then the possible benefit in Vitrectomy NO DOUBT outweights the risk."
EyeFloaters,fdgb4xw,t3_ekvc0p,1578388105.0,"I think it really depends on your personality type: I am heavily neurotic, having suffered from depression and anxiety for years prior to thus, so this is not something I have found I can get used to. It's torment.

If you have a good mental health prior to this, then their is a good chance that over time, you will accept them and be able to ignore them at least somewhat."
EyeFloaters,fddf6ry,t1_fddbs22,1578309516.0, Some of us CAN'T live with these floaters DAMMIT!! There are people who have killed themselves over it. Victrectomy is a last resort and a pretty good one at that.......there are risks but they are worth taking if floaters make you consider suicide seriously.
EyeFloaters,fda390d,t1_fd900jw,1578241125.0,"When your whole life has been comsumed by the floaters, vitrectomy may be last resort. I don't think anybody thinks of it as nothing, but for some it's their last resort in order to survive."
EyeFloaters,fd8ui9p,t3_ekbsgo,1578223543.0,"I talked to a guy who had several victrectomies, so yes."
EyeFloaters,fcyavwd,t1_fcrj6we,1578077359.0,I thought the exact same. I sure hope so!
EyeFloaters,fcxkxux,t3_eirw7p,1578065446.0,"It's been about 7-8 months since mine got worse, and they bother me more and more over time :("
EyeFloaters,fckdie1,t3_ehmdj0,1577722891.0,Sounds very much like a scam.
EyeFloaters,fcicyv5,t1_fci1wuj,1577660704.0,Water doesnt help make my floaters any more bearable.
EyeFloaters,fc01b1i,t1_fbz7twf,1577273339.0,I see mine way more in sunny weather with a bright sky. Floaters are different from each person-
