astrology,ff2gp6o,t3_er5xyb,1579505372.0,"We do get nervous, but a lot of us are so open minded and in such a universal mindset, that we usually can be simultaneously anxious about something and still know everything will end out okay in the end. It’s an interesting paradox"

Everything happens at different times for everyone but don’t let it bring down your confidence OR make you mad at other people for being a little ahead of you. It’s not their faults and it’s not yours. Just be patient and ride the roller coaster of life 🤠"

teenagers,fdkv6ab,t3_elrd5s,1578511818.0,Parents nowadays don’t realize how this affects us... it’s true cognitive dissonance when they share stories about how much freedom they had in their childhood to do whatever they want and then turn around and track us/ check everything on our phones.

AdviceForTeens,fdks6ow,t3_elrxzg,1578510046.0,"I’ve dealt with insomnia since I was 13, I’m 16 too. Not much helps but things I’ve found help are things that take my mind off my thoughts such as having a show or video or music playing in the background (something that relaxes you). I watch ASMR and it helps a lot but I know that it’s not everyone, but it may be worth a try. I also take melatonin which helps and use essential oils (which also aren’t for everyone I know maybe it’s just placebo but it helps me). White noise is good too, I listen to rain and fan sounds. Also red lights help your brain get tired. Just a few suggestions. Trust me I know it’s hard. If it get really bad, I would recommend going to a doctor for actual sleeping medicine."

astrology,fdevj2p,t3_eky552,1578347478.0,I think as Gemini’s our love language is intelligence and in times where we feel like we’re lacking that we take it harder than other signs would. Childhood is basically all discovery so that might be why
spirituality,fdej821,t3_eku32r,1578340181.0,"I have moments where I feel intense negative and positive energy. It literally is the only thing I can feel for 5 minutes , and then after something really good or really bad will happen to either me, someone I know, or the world. 

This last happened a couple nights ago right before the guy in Iran got assassinated.

I don’t know what’s happening I just know the energy I feel, but I can’t specifically guess the future. 

Am I psychic?"

If you can find one of those you can either them to help you tell your parents you want therapy or explain your situation to the therapist and they can probably help you figure something out. If you need money for it go fund me is a good idea, if your parents or no other family members are willing to help. I’m sorry I hope you get stronger"
offmychest,fdefii0,t3_ekwcpv,1578337905.0,"Also Ricky has a history of discrediting mental illness and transphobia, so people kind of already didn’t like him for that"
offmychest,fdefeub,t3_ekwcpv,1578337841.0,"I just think it was the way he said it. I agree in the essence that sometimes celebs and rich people just say shit so people will like them more, but I also feel people who are going to accept an award and politicize their speech have not much to gain from it. They’re most likely going to isolate a certain portion of their audience so they might lose fans. I just feel like he was little to pessimistic. Nothing is going to change if people don’t believe they can change things"
