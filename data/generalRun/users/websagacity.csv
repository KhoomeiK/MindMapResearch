AdviceAnimals,fdemdgw,t1_fdefot7,1578342077.0,"Nope. Just stating reality. Stiffing the server does nothing to help and only hurts the little guy.

As consumers we can make demands of the business, the industry and the Gov't; but withholding money from the person at the bottom of the chain is hurtful and counter productive. 

Currently they're there because they need money, and likely they do what they do because that is the way it is right now; and this allows them to actually earn more than they might otherwise.

Any server not making enough in tips that the employer has to make the difference wont be a server long. Any place that pays min wage for a server in lieu of tipping wont have very good servers and will likely go out of business."
