Also I just realized how insecure ""I'm not perfect"" sounds in the context used in the original image. The person who made that image is just volunteering that information. Like, it starts off immediately with a defensive stance. ""As a mama, I'm not perfect"" -- No one said you weren't perfect, but here you are defending yourself?

Imagine that context anywhere else.

Person A: ""Hi welcome to McDonald's, order when ready.""

raisedbyborderlines,fff3ydw,t1_ffei8y0,1579875067.0,"The original post is like one big ""I'm not racist, but..."" ramble.

If you're not racist, you shouldn't have to qualify your sentences with ""I'm not racist"". And if you're a decent mom, you don't need to draw so much attention to how decent of a mom you are. It's like bragging about being humble -- it just doesn't work.

""Designed to seem harmless"" is such an appropriate description of this kind of wording. Its literally a sentence that was ""crafted"" -- ""designed"" like an architect designing a building. It's not a natural set of words arranged in a sane/natural way. The whole image is just screaming ""look how normal and harmless I am"" which is not anything an actual harmless person would do."

I was the only person in my whole family whose lap he would sit on. When he was a kitten he used to sit on my lap while I ate breakfast before school. It was an important part of the day for him, and me too.

He had a habit of jumping into car windows and napping in the back. One time we had a telecom van come knocking on our door because they drove several blocks before he popped out to say hello. Luckily he had his tags with our address on them! Other times he would walk right into neighbors houses if they had their back door open. One neighbor came back from their kitchen to find him sitting on the couch looking at their TV.

BPDlovedones,ffd2cbx,t1_ffcx5py,1579812037.0,"Yeah, its really awful. They lack self awareness to such a degree, its like arguing with a child. Which, if I understand the literature well enough, is pretty accurate since their emotional development is usually stunted around the age of 5.

In my case, my pwBPD was molested at age 5. I have no doubt that was a major factor in her behavior. When she first told me about what happened, I was heart broken and angry at her abuser. How could someone do that to a sweet little toddler? It's unthinkable, and gut wrenching.

But then when my pwBPD's rages came out, all I could think was that: the poor little abused child inside of her was never healed, never felt safe. And it hurt to see someone who went through that kind of abuse, return that abuse on someone she claimed to love.

It made it extra confusing and painful to me, because I had insight into why she was acting like a scared child throwing a tantrum. But at the same time, that didn't make it ok.

It breaks my heart to know her life was set down such a ruinous path at such a young age. She was pretty much guaranteed to have issues with intimacy and connection.

Anyway, I pretty much lost all my new friends because of her. I don't talk to anyone I know from that city anymore. They were her friends first, so I just don't know what exactly she told them about me. None of them reached out to me after the breakup, so I figured she had already told them that I was the abuser. I pretty much only talk to the friends I had before I met her five years ago."

Sometimes I still hold out hope that there is a person behind all the BS she put me through, someone I might consider a friend. But every new contact I get from her is a good reminder why I can never be friends with her again. She's sick, and needs so much help.

I still can't fully reconcile that the person I used to love, and the person who abused me, are the same person. But emails like this are a reminder that the person I loved, if she was ever real, is gone. And never coming back."

Even if you wanted to ignore labels, normal people don't use self harm to manipulate their loved ones, and they definitely don't use their new relationships to hurt people. Just by the actions itself, these are extremely unhealthy maladaptive behaviors, regardless of labels.

My wife was never diagnosed, but most pwBPD never get diagnosed. I doubted if it was BPD, until she started actively spreading lies and smearing my reputation on twitter. No normal person does that. I've never felt the need to drag someone I used to love after a breakup. That shit is sick, and it was the last straw of my denial."

Also, I've been on this sub for while, and from what I've read from others, the lucidity moments thing is pretty common. They'll get these really brief moments of clarity, but they don't last long.

I've even gone on the BPD sub itself to try to get answers first hand. It's still pretty mixed. I came to the conclusion that some pwBPD are fully aware of what they are doing, and manipulate and harm intentionally. Some are also fully aware of what they are doing, but literally can not control it in the moment, and are not in control of their emotional outbursts. Others seem totally out of control, and not very self aware at all.

Some even claim to blackout during rages, and literally have gaps in memory, as if they were extremely drunk and their brain shuts down. In those cases, the pwBPD may legitimately not believe you when you later call them out on their behavior, and to them it literally is you gaslighting them. It's kinda frightening, because you can't really co-exist with someone that removed from reality. And it fucks with your head too, because when they say ""I don't remember that"" or act like a rage event didn't happen, you can't really know if they are being genuine and don't recall, or if they are lying and trying to manipulate you.

Reality for them is so distorted, they distort your reality as you get close to them -- not unlike a black hole, in many ways."
BPDlovedones,ffbu8p8,t1_ffbs076,1579782927.0,"That's kinda the thing: You'll probably never know what was real or fabricated. If any of it was real.

That part has fucked me up the most, because we were together five years. She was a quiet borderline, so her symptoms only ever manifested as ADHD-like; mild depression at times, and occasional dissociative episodes from her childhood trauma. I was aware of those things, but she was never abusive during the relationship. It all exploded out right at the end, full on abuse for 3 weeks. All typical borderline stuff: suicide threats, violence, rages, cheating, devaluing, name calling, flip-flopping, disappearing for days, triangulating, lying, gaslighting.

The things she said and did made me question the entire relationship."

I know a little bit about Gameboy hardware, and a little about music composition/production, but not using actual gameboy hardware for that purpose. I'm also a huge lover of video game OSTs and chiptune.

Do you have a link for some of your music, or videos of you performing?

Also, are you familiar with the [Level 1 theme from Jurassic Park for Gameboy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywRGNGRmRws&list=PLCFCC075FEABA1239&index=2)? It's probably one of my favorite gameboy themes. The whole soundtrack of that game is amazing. That song specifically has an interesting history too: apparently the song was recycled and remixed from a [Commodore 64 game called Comic Bakery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf29ShkoAiA) (warning, this version gets a little loud and noisy at some parts). This same version was reused in [Top Gun for Commodore 64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYcDU4MrqO4).

The song got remixed again in [Jurassic Park 2 for Gameboy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hu8pG2HHcQ&t=50s) (different from the Jurassic Park 1 version), which is where I first heard the song, and is probably my favorite version. The song got remixed yet again for a [PC game called Platypus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ-9PA9bXY0).

I made two of my own remixes of this song, but haven't released them anywhere yet.

If you'd like to message me and just talk about about game music, chiptune stuff, or music in general, I would love that. I'm going through a hard time right now, and honestly just talking about hobby stuff would be really nice. I also have a handful of songs I've composed over the years, but never really shared with anyone.

BPDlovedones,ffbrqmv,t3_esl5vg,1579780183.0,"I'm pretty sure my pwBPD's new replacement for me is also a pwBPD. I was friends with the guy, before he decided to tell my wife that he was in love with her and start an emotional affair. I got some of those ""vibes"" from him, if you know what I mean. Not explicit red flags, but just a certain energy. Sometimes he had the wide-eyed ""crazy eyes"" look.

When I confronted him about the affair, he oscillated between crying, saying he was sorry, to being aggressive with me. He told me he has trouble keeping friendships, apparently has a ""history"" and self identified himself as ""a slut."" He also told me that he had ""done this before"" when referring to inserting himself into a married couple's lives. So he had been an affair partner before, or involved himself in love triangles, or both.

I later talked to his ex (I was friends with her too) and she confirmed some of my suspicions. She told me that he had also lunged at her, or cornered her against a wall, and made loud threatening gestures. And apparently after me confronting him about his affair, she had found him later on his kitchen floor crying to himself that ""everyone leaves me.""

My pwBPD also had an ex best friend who seemed to be BPD. Her friend called the police on her, and tried to plant drugs in her room to get her arrested. Which is just one of the instances.

I've already explained it all before, there is nothing I haven't already said to her, and she didn't listen then, why would she listen now?

Truth is that her word choice here is cleverly crafted to make her appear innocent. So lashing back wouldn't serve anything other than ""proving"" that I am the unstable person she painted me to be. I can't say anything to her, because no doubt her lawyer is also combing her emails.

>I don't know what it was that I did to upset you

I'll recount:

* Had an emotional affair with your coworker, starting this whole mess. Who, might I add, I also considered a friend.
* Tried to triangulate me into a polyamorous triad with him.
* You told me I could say ""no,"" then got angry when I said ""no.""
* Didn't respect my answer of ""no"" when I stated it clearly multiple times.
* I told you I would consider it, and you demanded I make my mind up within just days, if I wanted to fundamentally have our relationship dynamics changed.
* You forced this situation upon me.
* You became aggressive and rage fueled after I said a firm and final ""no.""
* Called me narcissistic, controlling, abusive, and an asshole when I tried to express my feelings.
* Screamed at me daily.
* Tried to hide your affair from others, including your friend (who is your affair's ex)
* Told me that I wasn't allowed to tell anyone about what was happening.
* Told all of our mutual friends that I was the one abusing you.
* Attempted to kill yourself, while I was only 10 feet away in the other room.
* I find you a sobbing mess on the kitchen floor after, and I'm now terrified to leave you, thinking you might actually commit suicide if I do.
* I wanted to call an ambulance, or something. You needed help. But you refused, and told me not to tell anyone.
* The rages continue afterward. 
* You later would not talk about what happened that night, and I just wanted to know what was going on.
* I said to you that if we go to marriage counselling, that I absolutely wanted to to talk about the suicide attempt, and how it affected me. You refused, saying that I can not bring it up.
* You made me keep your suicide attempt a secret, and made me feel scared to tell anyone.
* Later that week, you pressed yourself on me, and groped me sexually, while I repeatedly yelled ""no"" and ""stop."" You ignored me, and I had to force your arms off of me.
* While you were groping me against my will, you looked at me and said ""this belongs to us."" My penis is your public property? That shit made me feel sick.
* When I confronted you about that event, you just stared at the ground silently. I demanded to know what you meant by ""this belongs to us"" and why the hell ""stop"" and ""no"" made you feel entitled to continue. You said nothing, and just left the house.
* You disappeared for several days, with no word or communication.
* You accused me of spending ""your money,"" screaming in a rage, while simultaneously withholding all of my own savings from me in your personal checking account.
* When I asked to see proof of my outrageous spending, you refused to show me the statement. You kept changing the number as well -- $800, $400, $200. How much did I supposedly ""spend"" of ""your money?""
* When I confronted you with receipts of what I actually spent money on: groceries, pants, vet bills for our sick cat, medication for our sick cat, and bus fare -- you had nothing to say about that.
* The only expense of mine that was high was fastfood. But as I explained, I had spent the week bouncing around the city looking for legal aid and therapy. I had to eat what ever was available in the areas.
* You promised to split our savings, and give me half to start my life over with. You agreed to give me $4000. You never did this.
* You left me with nothing. I had to flee the country with roughly $40 total to my name.
* You accused me of spinning ""stories"" while doing the exact same thing yourself.
* For 3 days, each night, you would either yell at me to ""go sleep on the couch"" then the next night be almost in tears asking me if I was going to sleep with you in the bed. You did this push/pull for 3 days.
* Then you suddenly tell me you ""don't feel safe"" sleeping in bed with me, and dissappeared again for several days.
* You told me you were at your affair partner's house, and swore you ""slept on the couch, nothing happened"" -- sorry, I don't believe that, you give me no reason to believe it.
* When we had a marriage counselling appointment set up, I asked that you please stop texting your affair partner while we get counselling. You refused to do that. So I asked for a divorce.
* When I asked you ""what did you think would happen from all of this? Did you really expect me to just agree with you having a side boyfriend?"" You responed angrily: ""I wish you would just say YES!"" You made it extremely transparent at that moment, that my feelings were never your concern -- the only thing that mattered is that you get what you wanted, and keep me under your control. 
* I confronted you for all of this, explained all of this to you already, and you did nothing to acknowledge it. You continue to deny it.
* I explained to you multiple times, that all of these reasons are why I am leaving you, why I want a divorce. You still refuse to acknowledge any of it.

It sucks, because I've come to realize that the very existence of narcissistic/psychopathic individuals in the world is pretty much the whole reason most people are so walled off -- because you just can not 100% know the intentions of strangers, and thus it is reasonable to one's own safety and sanity to keep a certain emotional distance from strangers.

I read that if I can get a separation agreement signed with her, that there won't be a need to for court. Is this true? As far as I understand, a Separation Agreement basically outlines how things would be divided, who gets what, and is agreed on by both parties. And if that works out, then divorce is just a matter of filing the the paperwork. Yes?

> When it comes to assets, what happens under family law is you are entitled to half the increase in your net family assets between when you married and the date of separation.

We didn't have any assets. I sold my car before moving to Canada. When living in Canada we rented, didn't own a home or any property. As far as I know, we only had our bank accounts.

And from the date we we were married to the date of separation, I'm pretty sure our net worth decreased. During the nearly 3 years we were married, we both experienced layoffs and unemployment for a time, as well as the cost of immigration, our general net worth just went down. Not sure how that would be factored.

We have no assets. I had to buy a car for work after we separated, but it is entirely owned, operated, and titled in the US. The car was bought on a loan, so its more of a debt than asset. She has student loan debts, and that's about it.

She's attempted to email me a few times, and has not once mentioned divorce or anything like that. But she seems pretty adamant on getting me to legally abandon my PR status in her country, as she is fully aware that she is financially responsible for me if I decide to move back to that country. Someone suggested that that may be leverage to get her to be more cooperative, as I could technically bankrupt her simply by applying for social housing and support in her country (the immigration agreement says that the federal government will foot her the bill for any public costs I would incur within the first 5 years of permanent resident status).

But the question is how do I play that card without it coming off as an offensive move. Fuck I hate playing mental chess with pwBPD.

I'll look into the internet therapy options. For me, being physically present with the therapist is really important, but if that just isn't an option, I would rather have something than nothing.

This has been a other obstacle for me. I didn't really realize that what I was experiencing was trauma, until very recently. I've been having frequent nightmares replaying events, or being assaulted by her.

I've been to two different therapists, and they haven't been entirely helpful. One was great, but didn't seem to have the expertise of traumatic abusive relationships.

This is what scares me the most right now too. She took all of my savings, and left me with nothing before I fled her country. I also became incredibly ill and haven't worked much in the last year. I only have a couple hundred dollars.

Besides that, through therapy and meditation, I have detached from any expectations of what the label ""mother"" is ""supposed to"" mean. At this point, ""mother"" is just another stranger on the street to me. One that I've unfortunately known my whole life.

That said, my mother is still the worst roommate I've ever had to share a living space with, by far. I wouldn't voluntarily associate with her even if we weren't related by blood.

I do still feel alien when others talk about their loving relationships with their caregivers, but I just can't relate, and so I don't particularly feel any sense of ""loss"" anymore.

It would be pretty cool if I had someone older in my life to fill a sort of mentor/parental role, but I've let go of that fantasy at this point, because it's just not healthy to cling to, or project that onto others.

No doctor or sane person would say that.

But if you carry a painful STI, especially one that carries a cancer risk, or has no full cure? People actually say ""It's so common, you're just spreading fear and stigma.""

Uhhh... No. The increasing reports of throat cancer from the CDC is what spreads *legitimate* fear and stigma. This shit isn't made up, the fear is based on actual real evidence. And there are still cancer causing strains of HPV that aren't covered by the vaccine yet, as well as new ""super"" strains that are developing faster and more difficult to treat.

But you know, people gotta defend their sexual egos, convincing themselves that they are invincible, or it would never happen to them because they're ""safe"" (so was I, but condoms don't prevent HPV), or convincing themselves that painful bleeding blisters, and throat surgery is ""no big deal"" or ""really rare,"" as if that doesn't make it real or serious.

Its fucking weird to me. Dating for me is forever changed. All because I dated someone who felt entitled to unscrupulous sex, and didn't really care about the consequences. When she cheated on me and told me she wanted to be polyamorous, I asked her about her cancerous HPV and if she's OK spreading that to others, and how she plans to deal with that. She said ""they don't have to know"" and that ""it's really common.""

I'm glad you genuinely apologized, and didn't just double down like I've seen some people do. I had doctors dismiss my pain too,  and wasn't able to get treatment for months. Meanwhile the papilloma tumor inside my throat was growing.

I understand your frustration though. I've been through the range of emotions about it all myself. When I got infected, I wasn't as concerned, because I had my partner with me as emotional support. I really deeply loved her, and planned to spend my life with her. We were getting married, and I had no intention of sleeping with anyone else, so I didn't mind the infection too much... other than the pain itself of the warts.

But that same partner is the one with BPD who later cheated, lied, abused, and discarded me, and I've since had to go through all of this medical stuff alone, including MRI and surgery.

She also is refusing to share her PAP smear records with me, so I can know which strains I have. I only recall her telling me she tested positive for 10 or so strains of HPV, and about 4 of the High risk cancerous ones. She also had precancerous cells removed from her uterus and mouth.

I'm more upset about it all now, because I really don't know if she was cheating for 5 years or what... or where or how she passed it to me. I learned she's a pathological liar, and part of me wonders if she knew she had it the whole time. I'll never know, as I can't trust her.

And what ever form of super HPV she gave me, all I know is that I've had persistent painful genital warts for 5 years, and now going through oral wart/growth problems. It never has cleared on its own, and has re-ocourred 3 times after treatment with topical medication. So I don't believe the optimistic claims that it clears in 12 months and is gone for good. I am living proof that is not true. I have read that HPV hides in the nerve cells, and is more or less with you for life, much like herpes or HIV. That seems to be true in my experience. Even if its only 1% of HPV cases that persist like this, I got unlucky enough to be that 1%. I'm glad that 90% of people with HPV experience no pain or clear on their own, but real human beings aren't just a favorable statistic. And now I have to live with the anxiety of potentially passing this on if I ever choose to date again. That is if I can ever get a consistent date who will be willing to risk that kind of infection.

Anyway, if you're curious about Borderline Personality Disorder, there are subs for understanding it: /r/BPDlovedones 

Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is in the same ""Cluster B"" of personality disorders, such as: Narcississtic Personality Disorder (NPD), Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD), and Anti-Social Personality Disorders (ASPD, or sometimes called just sociopathic). They overlap a lot, and share the same general rages, manipulation, narcississtic self-centeredness, and low/no empathy.

Borderline gets its name from ""someone who is on the border of Neurosis and Psychosis."" Some professionals feel this name is outdated, but having seen the psychotic rage personally, I think it is fitting.

It's an awful experience to fall in love with someone like that, especially when they hide that behavior from you for 5 years and explode all at once. It sounds like you may have experienced this kind of person. Feel free to browse around on the /r/BPDlovedones sub and see if your experiences relate.

Best of luck to you on your journey. Narcissistic personalities of the ""Cluster B"" spectrum are worst kind of people I have met."
HPV,fdujeyj,t3_en2mlb,1578733991.0,"Just curious, is there an HPV test for men? Last I heard there was no physical/chemical test for HPV in men -- only PAP smears in women could detect some strains of HPV.

I ask because my ex wife got tested and came up positive for several strains of HPV, including I believe 4 of the high risk cancer strains. But she is refusing to send me a copy of her test results so I can know which strains I have."
HPV,fdugfwf,t3_emz59z,1578732597.0,"I've had about 3 out breaks of bumps around the penis in the last 5 years. They never cleared alone, always had to have them removed with cream or something.

A few months ago I had a papilloma tumor in the oropharanx removed, likely HPV related. Biopsy indicated non cancerous, but I am also still having painful smaller bumps down the back of my throat. I seem to have the kind that is persistent. And my ex already had precancerous tissue removed from the uterus and mouth. So I feel like it is a matter of when for me.

This virus sucks, and fuck the US government for not making the vaccine mandatory or more widely available."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fdue6kw,t1_fdu7kib,1578731749.0,"Please don't ever tell anyone with HPV that they are over reacting. HPV is now the leading cause of throat cancer (70% of all oropharynx cancer cases), and rates of infection are increasing each year, as well as the discovery of new vaccine resistant strains.

I had to be put under and have surgery to remove a tumor from my throat, and am still recovering from that. I was so sick, I was bed bound and struggling to breathe leading up to my surgery date. My breathing and voice are permanently changed from that surgery. I spent weeks coughing up blood and getting bacterial infections. I really don't find it funny. How dare you tell me to calm down. Your condescending attitude is not appreciated, and your medical knowledge is out dated.

Don't ever tell someone with a legitimate health condition to ""calm down."" Especially when it is an infectious carcinogenic disease. I don't want to pass this on to anyone."
BPDlovedones,fdu9ihu,t3_en08ht,1578729909.0,"Mine did the vegan boho stoner thing, then kinda vaguely hipster, eventually yuppie/professional not vegan, and now some sort of hipster tarot witch. There was like a sort of Riot Grrrrl phase in there somewhere too. The changes were kinda gradual, and she had the kind of body that could pull off any look, so I never really noticed the changes as they were happening. She would just sorta casually mention she was trying a new look, and it always looked great on her.

I did notice she was obsessed with her appearance and how others perceived her. And in retrospect, I can definitely see the distinct style changes over the years. She was a chameleon, morphing to match whatever crowd she was trying to fit into at the time.

She spent so much money on clothes."
BPDlovedones,fdte59d,t1_fdt4nra,1578715467.0,"Yeah, I feel that. Also was raised by a BPD/NPD mom.

I wasn't officially diagnosed bipolar to my knowledge, but did see a therapist during a particularly stressful time in my life. At the time I had some hypomanic episodes, and we considered it and just observed the mood swings. It was able to manage with therapy, diet, and meditation, and never took mood stabilizers. But after that period of my life, I haven't felt those mood swings like that. So I feel it was more stress related. 

Regardless, I explained this to my pwBPD and told her I may be bipolar. And she mirrored me back and said she was bipolar too.

Of course, in the final weeks when she was absuing me, gaslighting, and twisting reality, she tried to convince me that it was me that was the problem. I was distressed because she had an affair and then screamed at me until I was crying, and then tried to blame my mood on a ""bipolar episode.""

I didn't have any mood swing episodes after I left her. I'm 100% sure that wasn't bipolar related, and was just a legitimate distress from being abused and cheated on. So that was pretty cruel of her to try to make me take blame for the way she treated me.

And of course, when she went off with her new boyfriend immediately after I left, she started mirroring his epilepsy and claiming she had sezuires too. Despite the fact I had never seen her have a sezuire in our entire 5 year relationship.

She also started having panic attacks at work after she cheated on me. I have no doubt it was to gain sympathy at work, as I am aware she told everyone I was the one abusing her. I also never saw her have a panic attack in our whole relationship. And she never had one in front of me. 

Anyway, pwBPD mirroring their partners illnesses is also a common thing."
BPDlovedones,fdt3h70,t3_emvp6i,1578711427.0,"That's rough. I find that the quiet borderlines are the most devastating. They hide it all so well, and their problems tend to be excusable by other mental health issues. A lot of pwBPD also hide their BPD diagnosis, if they ever get one. They'll call it ""anxiety and depression"" to make it seem less severe than it is, or blame it on ""bipolar and ADHD."" My BPD ex claimed to have all of these things.

Good thing you recognized what you were dealing with sooner than later. I only wish I had known about BPD sooner."
BPDlovedones,fdszi0q,t1_fdsiar9,1578709966.0,"This is extremely accurate. Exactly what happened with me. The quiet borderline types can run the idealization phase for years. Mine was 5 years, and we got married. It wasn't until we broke the long distance and lived together that she devalued me, felt engulfed, and had an affair with her new target."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fdswxvd,t3_emzow6,1578709010.0,"I'm dealing with a similar problem. I've come to realize that I am attracted (platonically and romantically) to emotionally unavailable people. It isn't a conscious thing that I seek out, but just something that I don't notice until far too late. Like you said, it's almost instinctual. I just seem to attract them, and they attract me. I spent most of my 20's just weeding out the narcissists in my life. Once I become aware of a persons narc behavior, I disengage hard. Narcissism isn't something I actually like or value, but again, just as you said, the more I seem to learn to detect it, the more I attract the the covert types who hide it well.

The last woman I married turned out to be BPD (which is so similar to NPD in terms of emotional unavailability and lack of empathy). She was the ""quiet type"" of borderline, so her ""lashing out"" behavior was inward, where it was invisible to me. We were together 5 years, and married. She was really good at masking it all. She was not abusive to me during that time. Until the final discard in the last few weeks of our relationship. Then came the gaslighting, suicide attempts, guilt trips, sexual assault, and an affair -- as well as emptying my bank account, smearing my reputation, and basically leaving me for dead. All in one big meltdown over the course of about two weeks.

Once I became aware of the extent of her behavior, I quickly fled.

I too was 100% certain that the woman I married was genuine, kind, compassionate. She had never showed a cruel or sadistic side to me before. Until she suddenly did, and went full mask-off. I now also feel terrified of anyone who I'm attracted to. I don't trust my own judgment anymore.

Besides all that, if I ever do find a healthy normal person to date, they would have to be OK with the risk of dating a person who carries a cancer causing strain of HPV. That was another gift that my abusive borderline ex wife gave me.

I just don't see any prospects in my future of ever being romantically fulfilled. Going into my 30's with sexual/emotional trauma, incurable contagious diseases, health issues, and no money. I haven't been able to make new friends, trust people, or hold a job now too. Last job I lost because I spent too much time in the bathrooms crying. I've lost the ability to function or feel safe in public. I really just don't know what to do anymore.

I had to move back home with my NPD/BPD mother, which is the last thing I wanted to do. I have no doubt now that she is a major contributor to my attraction to emotionally unavailable people -- it's all I knew growing up. Neglect and rage. I thought I had unlearned all that in therapy, but didn't see the that the person I married was  the same. But instead of exploding every week, she only exploded once in 5 years -- all that resentment and rage coming out at once.

And yeah, I'm terrified that the next person I meet (whether friend or lover) will be another cluster B disordered person. Since learning about BPD, I've realized that several other family and friends I know have it, and it explains a lot of the bizarre, abusive, and impulsive behavior. I had already distanced myself from those people, but didn't have a word for why I didn't trust them. Now I do. I've become distant and skeptical of my old friends now too. I just don't trust anyone anymore, including myself."
ptsd,fdsqr96,t3_emz2tn,1578706727.0,"Yes. Especially after being gifted a couple incurable STDs by that person too. I can not imagine a future where I am ever intimate with another person again. I've been battling some sort of throat infection for the last year, which isn't getting better, even after a recommended surgery. The thought of even kissing again is unimaginable right now, as theirs a persistent sour taste in my mouth, along with a dirty feeling.

And that's not even touching on the trust issues."
raisedbyborderlines,fds9579,t3_emrpwk,1578697212.0,"My dad is not NPD to any degree. Possibly codependent. He is pretty much just the textbook definition of an enabler though.

He just allows my BPD/NPD mom to act out her borderline/narcississtic rages. He'll passively complain about her, but then do nothing to change his situation. I don't think I've ever seen him stand up for himself once. He has no friends, and allows her to keep him isolated. He stopped seeing any of his family because of her hatred of them. He just complies with her every demand. He does all the chores, shopping, and works a fulltime job. My mom spends the whole day at home just being miserable and angry, and stalking people on Facebook.

I used to pity my dad. But now, I just can not understand why someone would put themselves through all that. The only conclusion I can come up with is that he feels like he deserves to be treated poorly, and has absolutely no self respect.

I used to talk to him about leaving her, and try advocating for him, but he would never actually do it. He used to use the ""for the kids"" excuse for why he stayed with her. But its been more than 10 years since the last kid became an adult and moved out. So just got to witness decades of divorce threats from both of them, and raging argumentation. Which led to nothing. Now he just nods and agrees to whatever she says, afraid to even have an opinion for himself that slightly differs from hers.

I don't talk to him much at all about anything anymore, because I don't trust that he won't relay everything I say to him back to my BPD/NPD mother. I keep any conversation to grey-rocking, with no personal details of my life.

Enablers are what give the BPD parents of the world power. If my dad were a reasonable person with self worth, he would have left at the first rage and not subjected his child to that kind of person.

What ever remaining sympathy I had for him is pretty much gone."
BPDlovedones,fdrh09y,t1_fdrcs31,1578684444.0,"It doesn't matter what they think of you. These people are sadistic and possibly psychopathic, all of them. Their opinion is worthless. You worry about yourself right now, and fuck what they consider to be ""weak"" or ""strong."" We're talking about people with very fucked up morals. Best to just erase them all from your life and get therapy, for your own mental health.

This shit was intentionally harmful to you, and they know that. Please take care of yourself."
CPTSD,fdqmls6,t3_emodr1,1578670249.0,"I'm a few chapters from the end of it, and this book has helped me realize a lot of things that I never quite grasped in my therapy sessions years ago.

I thought I had worked through all of my childhood issues, but life has shown me otherwise. 

One of the best books I've ever read, and is definitely in my ""life saver"" book list."
BPDlovedones,fdqi37t,t1_fdq9nml,1578667215.0,I'm so sorry. It's an awful experience.
BPDlovedones,fdq8k1m,t1_fdppqrh,1578659272.0,"Yeah, I've only recently considered that I have some form of PTSD. But the nightmares and fear of human touch kinda speaks for itself.

Im looking into EMDR therapy, but searching for a therapist is exhausting in itself. I know I need it, but I also noticed I am putting up resistance, for some reason.

The more direct concern for me is this chronic throat pain. My doctors don't seem to have any idea, and the surgery only helped a little. It clearly feels like some kind of foreign infection to me, but no labs are detecting anything.

I can't focus on anything when it hurts to swallow and breathe."
BPDlovedones,fdq884x,t1_fdq1c8n,1578658922.0,"Lol, I feel that. I wouldn't be surprised if +90% of therapy sessions in the world are the direct cause of cluster B abuse. The remaining small percent are people who experienced natural traumatic events, like hurricanes, chronic illness, car accidents, etc."
aspiememes,fdq7wdn,t1_fdq5wew,1578658575.0,"I'm so sorry. I wish that no one ever felt alienation, or that it was relatable.

I'm aware that socio-economic alienation is broadly a problem of our society too, that even neurotypical people experience alienation in various degrees and periods. Alienation broadly stemming from the atomization and isolation of individualistic societies, and the breaking down of communites and community centers. Depression and anxiety are at record highs. 

But there's a uniquely alien experience of also being acutely aware of it all, and watching people repeatedly blame themselves, and hurt themselves, when they lose jobs, or are faced with plain unlucky circumstances. Just the way people treat the poor, the sick, the homeless... It breaks my heart. 

I don't remmeber who made the quote exactly (probably Charles Bukowski) but something I've felt more and more as I get older:

> There is nothing healthy about being well adapted to a profoundly sick society.

As I have met a handful of very happy and successful psychopaths in my life, I can't help but agree. (But I suppose that's all beyond the scope of this sub reddit) 

Anyway, being a weird loner kid who couldn't tolerate eye contact, or the feeling of certain fabrics, was hard enough as it is, lol."
BPDlovedones,fdpmczw,t1_fdpjawn,1578632708.0,"Yeah, I had a similar experience on that front too. I was kinda sick when she was devaluing me, and the whole affair thing happened. I mentioned that she made herself the victim of the affair:

> When I told her she needs to choose between me (her husband), and her side boyfriend, she expected me to console her grief for having to ""breakup"" with him.

But I forgot to mention that she refused to actually breakup with him. Lol. So even after guilting me to consoling her through her ""breakup"" with her affair partner, she didn't even do it. And she refused to meet me half way and even pause texting with him while we went to couples therapy. So I told her I wanted a divorce, and left.

After I left, my illness got much worse. For a couple months of 2019, I had no energy and was bed bound. I had to have surgery eventually, and then heal from that. So between that and the abuse (and lead up to leaving my wife with BPD) I was also in survival mode, and just not processing or functioning much.

I'm starting to get my energy back, but not fully recovered yet. And the flashbacks, memories, realizations, and nightmares have been flooding my mind. Many ""what the fuck"" realizations as well."
BPDlovedones,fdphuha,t1_fdpfn26,1578629030.0,"Yikes. That's pretty awful. I'm so sorry.

My pwBPD also made herself the victim in her own affair. When I told her she needs to choose between me (her husband), and her side boyfriend, she expected me to console her grief for having to ""breakup"" with him.

She still insisted she was the victim, even after she sexually assaulted me. They're definitely delusional.

Mine also did the whole ""see you in a another life"" speech, and had lots of pseudo spiritual ideas about ""bad energies"" and the like. The ""bad energies"" were (of course) always her own moods, but she externalized them and projected these moods onto the house itself, or ""bad spirits.""

They externalize every inner experience as some outside entity that is intent on harming them, specifically and personally."
BPDlovedones,fdpdyqv,t1_fdpdbnr,1578626191.0,"True. It surprised me how drastically she flipped during the devalue phase, because she had been attentive and normal during previous illnesses of mine.

But the particular illness I felt at the time was oral related, and left my throat feeling very sore and dry, as well as headaches and nauseated. So I had to frequently deny kisses and sex because I just felt really gross and sickly. I always told her why I felt that way and didn't want to be I intimate, but I think she took those sexual rejections personally -- and went to find sexual attention elsewhere."
BPDlovedones,fdpde08,t1_fdp0c4e,1578625788.0,"Having exs around as ""just friends"" is extremely common for people with BPD. They tend to have an orbit of potential sexual partners around them at all times.

The simple answer for the discard without splitting: they just get bored of you.

Sometimes as a mental defense, they split you black and deem you as some sort of abuser. But in the case of a cold discard, they really just get bored of you and throw you away with the same lack of emotion as somone throws away a candy wrapper.

They don't really see people as people, but simply as psychological objects that they use to fulfill a selfish need. Just in the same way you don't treat your sandwich as a person and empathize with it, it's just a sandwich to fill your need (hunger). A pwBPD uses people in a similar manner, except the ""need"" they have is a bottomless craving for attention and validation.

When you no longer give them their ""fix,"" they discard you. Sometimes violently, sometimes abusively, sometimes just plain cold and emotionlessly."
BPDlovedones,fdpbbug,t1_fdpaz9m,1578624368.0,"That too. I was acused of being cruel to her in her dreams, and she was wary of me in real life because of it."
aspiememes,fdp7ljp,t1_fdozsac,1578621869.0,"I feel that. I remember feeling deeply alien, as early as age 6 or 7. I had philosophical thoughts such as ""what if I am the only conscious entity, and other people are dream manifestations operating on scripts, like some sort of game NPC or something"" or ""I don't feel like I belong to this species"" at kindergarten age. 

I loved nature/animal documentaries as a child (still do), but watching other kids/people always felt like watching one of those nature documentaries. I could understand their behavior, but only as a foreign observer studying a wild animal with intense scientific curiosity. I didn't feel like one of them. Neither superior nor inferior, just different. Though the bullying and social exclusion definitely started to make me feel inferior over time.

A lot of kids made it clear to me I was different and didn't belong. Children are brutally honest like that, while adults will bite their tongue and just ghost you instead. 

Being much older and wiser now, I don't feel *as* alien as before. I can pretty much understand others motivations from just having met so many different kinds of people. But much like the linked blog post above, I have periods of having a ""tribe,"" and periods of not having that sense of belonging.

Its hard to deal with, because I just don't fully relate to ""normal"" people, even if I can understand why they do what they do."
BPDlovedones,fdp5okk,t1_fdotah8,1578620590.0,"My pwBPD also accused me of narcissism. The things she accused me of were all behaviors she exhibited, a projection. They externalize their feelings and imagine them coming from you."
