london,ffwd0ks,t3_evbvhv,1580296020.0,I think what makes it look so beautiful and different to the typical London pics is the water looks blue for a change rather than the typical murky brown.
UXDesign,ffwb7um,t3_evjt2n,1580293555.0,I switched from web dev to UI/UX and my background in dev is hugely beneficial. It helps you realize if a design is practical and the effort that goes into developing an interface.
childfree,ffwb515,t3_evdf7g,1580293439.0,"One fitness instagrammer I used to follow got pregnant and turned into a mommy vlogger. One of her bright ideas was to post a video of her jumping around naked in an attempt to speed up labour. Never gonna forget that horrific sight. 

And yes, pregnancy seems like the most unnatural, disgusting thing to me. I know that sounds weird considering it's ""natural"", but it repulses me."

Definitely not, even the most lean and muscular competitors started off skinnyfat :)

I don't have anything else to say as everyone pretty much covered it! Except some personal experience - I'm 5'5 105 and despite lifting super hard for over 6 years, have never gotten close to bulky. Cardio or yoga won't give any shape to you, but it is a nice exercise to incorporate if you enjoy it. My cardio of choice is going on a long walk every morning. Really enjoyable, sustainable and I don't wish for it to end every second while I'm doing it lol."

OutOfTheLoop,ffu96hk,t1_ffu062h,1580237114.0,My cat is basically a dog. My dad has trained it to do all kinds of things. Every time he does a new trick I wonder how that even happened. It helps that his breed is basically defined as “dog-like”
