IncelTears,fgpxdnk,t1_fgpmttp,1581013826.0,"Oh absolutely! Personally I think we should redo the entire schooling system and curriculum to one more  suited to the individual rather than ""memorize, retain, pass"" idk about you but I retained all of the bare minimum from my school days and it's only been 2 years. we never learned about taxes and tax returns. The human populace is expected to just KNOW laws without any proper direction on where to access them. Most people don't even know you can find them on a government site until after they have been charged with something they didn't know was wrong.

 This does not apply to voting though. Voters should be able to prove they have the necessary knowledge to understand the goals and workings of the party and the candidate they are voting for."
IncelTears,fgpwxci,t1_fgpuo3j,1581013580.0,Yeah her wording is weird maybe it is what she meant but its overall unrealistic but a voting knowledge test??? Every voting poll should require one.
IncelTears,fgpuf28,t1_fgpni02,1581012208.0,"Once again it has nothing to do with education. All the information on every candidate is free to access on the internet, in news papers, on television and through word of mouth. There is no excuse to not know everything about what your voting for. If your too lazy to acquire the FREE ACCESSIBLE knowledge you should not be allowed to vote."
IncelTears,fgpmlke,t1_fgpleeq,1581007839.0,It's not dodgy at all. Shes not suggesting an IQ test shes suggesting that people prove they know about the people they are voting for. You would be surprised how many young people base their vote off memes. Sure it seems fun and comedic in the moment but look at our world leaders and tell me that happened due to smart people making smart choices.
creepypasta,fgplvfb,t3_ezsa1a,1581007420.0,He was never scary but he was part of the beginning guys! Have some respect ot wasnt scary because creepypasta as a whole was still new and not that intimidating imma leave this sub if they redo Jeff smh we can make him scary without changing the story just ADD MORE STORIES TO IT
aww,fgpjbof,t1_fgmetra,1581005941.0,Yeah I guess so. In a way at least. The term for a seal that has reached 1 to 3 years is a bedlamer. They cant reproduce until 3 or 4 in females and 5 or 6 in males. They live up to thirty years
aww,fgpigv3,t1_fgmfptt,1581005446.0,"Rehabilitation is for more than just drug addiction. It is a service that helps you heal when you need help and support. If an animal gets hurt in the wild it is more than likely going to die and in many cases these injured animals are found and brought to an animal hospital or something of the like to heal their injuries then brought to a rehabilitation center to reacclimate to the wild before they are properly released because they have been with humans and may not wish to return to the ""hard life"" or their instincts have just been dulled."

rant,fgltsyw,t3_ez146z,1580910765.0,"The female brain is actually built that once you have recovered from delivery the mind actually ""deletes"" the memories of just how serious the pain really was. So moral of the story is even women who HAVE had children don't know what they are talking about. Hope your pregnancy ends well and your baby comes into the world strong and happy."
aww,fglt972,t3_ez8jyk,1580910388.0,"Imma be the one to point this out.

That's not a baby. Yearling at most but not a pup. Also it's more than likely in a foster home after rehab or it was raised in captivity.

Or some sack had the bright idea to kidnap a seal and take it home. Let's all hope this is a foster home."

rant,ffwzev8,t3_evek75,1580314442.0,"In the LGBTQ parade here where I live the puppy play groups participate. I am a bit of a furry but have a friend who is much deeper into the fandom and her roommate is into puppy play. We all attend a convention together yearly and he always wears his leather outfit and dog mask and for the most part it isn't an issue. They all agree with me however that ""puppies"" should not participate in the pride parade in Edmonton as it is much different from the other groups. ""Puppies"" are grown men/women wearing leather masks and outfits that sexualize dogs. Now mind you it may not be sexual to the person doing it but that isn't how it looks on the outside. I just think that should be the boundary in the pride parade with how it is populated now. Children are everywhere guys put the floggers down."

raisedbyborderlines,ffpbkp1,t1_ffpa9fb,1580090968.0,Thank you for the support! And I agree it was a very funny typo. Unfortunately there was 1 confirmed case of the virus of a man returning from Wuhan to Toronto they caught him at the gate getting off the plane and quarantined him immediately. My fear is the people on the plane next to him.
