They make my day with their friendly greetings and as often as not will start my order before I order.  It’s not an easy job in my town and I try to do my best to let them know how much I appreciate them. This past Christmas I even got up early to make them my Christmas breakfast casserole and take it over to them for those who had to, or volunteered to, work as a way of thanking them for being a bright spot in my day. Here’s to all the hard working people who make us “regulars” feel special!"
Seahawks,ff8r740,t1_ff8e43l,1579692779.0,I think you are spot on. The only other thing I would add is how undisciplined the team always seems to be. The penalties every game kill them.

I have been so fortunate to see so many magnificent animals in their natural environment and every time I read about the apocalypse happening in Australia, I have to hold back tears. I get so angry at the people who say Koalas are dumb.....  as if it doesn’t matter this is happening to them.  Really? It seems to me the dumb animals on this planet are humans."
OldManDog,ff4zgnv,t3_erki9j,1579576189.0,"It sounds like Hamish was there for you every time you needed him. Remember that and feel him every time you need him still.

NatureIsFuckingLit,ff25b0i,t3_er2tm1,1579494213.0,"This is horrifying. As someone who has been to Australia twice and appreciated every second of it, seeing a Koala with a minuscule amount of water to drink in light of the Armageddon like fires ravaging the continent is heartbreaking. I know we are supposed to be happy that he/she has any water to drink but this just isn’t enough. Humans caused the horrible fires and it is our responsibility to ensure that these amazing beings get all the help they need"
