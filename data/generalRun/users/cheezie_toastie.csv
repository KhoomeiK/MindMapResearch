Whatever his thoughts or intentions were, even if you hadn't taken any medication, it would be incredibly gross of him to try to have sex with you while you were grieving. On top of that medication means you couldn't consent. I am so sorry.

It is not uncommon for people to be taken advantage of -- emotionally, sexually, economically -- during periods of grief. Please consider a grief counselor (and tell them about this) as well as the services of RAINN."

Is only true for highly attractive women. The inverse seemed to be true for less attractive women. Therefore, your later assertion

Is incorrect. Men seem to think high status but less attractive women are not worth the hassle.
