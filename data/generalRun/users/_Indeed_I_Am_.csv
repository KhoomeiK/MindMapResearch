I’m afraid you will not be granted another. At least, not as a human. Perhaps you were better off as a dog, like in your previous incarnation. You know what they say...

DotA2,fgv16n5,t1_fgsv9wy,1581134270.0,"What about before static link was changed to attack the linked target? And what about when old Spell Prism ability existed? I don‘t think suddenly gaining multishot is a barrier to this ability working on multiple targets, as it would have worked that way before regardless of the new attack mechanic.

With Jugg and SB it‘s slightly different mechanically because in order for the spell to be simultaneously cast on both targets there would literally have to be a second Jugg or SB to execute the ability - that‘s how those abilities work, even though Jugg‘s char model presumably is consigned to the same void as a hero that‘s under Astral Imprisonment.

Either way, abilities like LC‘s Duel still works - she doesn‘t attack both targets and IIRC she does gain Duel damage for both victories, so they could literally just code Razor‘s to work the same way. It‘s basically a reverse taunt without taking away hero movement control.

But who knows how the frog‘s mind works really. Consistency in Dota is such a farce - exists right up until you hit some weird interactions and then all bets are off."

DotA2,fft6ep0,t1_ffrizq3,1580209501.0,"That’s more of an exacerbation of the problems neutral items pose by themselves, rather than it being a problem unique to Arc. I don’t disagree with your point about it being kinda crazy, but it’s the same deal with all the other neutral items - their freeness for any hero creates an instant, intangible and sometimes immeasurable net worth advantage that is often imbalanced because of the hero concept and the enemy team composition.

In this case, neutral items are simply following basic mechanics that go with the concept of the hero.  And Dota has been moving away from having one-off interactions based on hero mechanics for like the last 3 years. No unique attack modifiers, stacking passives, etc. etc.

What I’m saying is, either neutrals need to be revamped or Arc needs to be revamped, but not *specifically* the way neutrals work on Arc himself.

This is of course with the caveat that rapier and consumables function differently in his unique case, but there is literally no way to give the duplicate access to those items without breaking the game. Neutrals on him don’t *break* the game, but he does expose their inherent imbalances much more acutely than other heroes for sure."
DotA2,ffqbwz7,t1_ffq87zh,1580129722.0,"But he already has duplicate Orchid, or Mjollnir, or Necrobook, or Midas, or Silver Edge, or whatever other items.

Neutrals really aren‘t that different in that they act the same way for Arc. His whole deal is that he becomes 2 actual heroes for short periods. Taking that away on the basis of neutral items not being „real“ items kinda flubs that whole concept. 

The only real cases for adjusting how items behave on him are, like that other guy said, with regards to rapier and consumables. They can‘t act the same way, because then how does the duplicate drop items? And when it‘s resummoned, getting full charges (or whatever the base Arc had) on consumables again would be broken."
gifs,ff838qn,t1_ff82ntv,1579664811.0,"Yep. Plant-life in Australia is specially adapted for bushfires and other adverse conditions in just the way you mentioned, among others. I think people were and are generally more concerned with the effect on the fauna more so than much of the flora, as well as the larger impact on the country’s (and indeed the world’s) ecosystem as a result of the ash clouds and other atmospheric releases or emissions. 

In addition to the impact on, and loss of human life, of course."

thisismylifenow,feq3nqe,t1_feppxvs,1579337203.0,"Ah yes, so these sit plainly on your nose - the typical adjustment point is the arms. If they still slide then perhaps the adjustment wasn‘t aggressive enough. 

The hook behind the ears can be made more acute, and I think the arms themselves can be made more severely concave but beyond that, I think it‘s just down to the frames - the width of them in relation to your face is important, because the extents will obviously act as the pivot points for the arms. 

The style, I think is fine, but most retailers (again, where I am) have a device that adjusts your fit based on how their apparatus sits on your face prior to you receiving the new frames. If your features are particularly aquiline, I believe they can also adjust the bridge as well (afterall, it‘s only manipulating shape with locally applied heat).

But, wireframes with cushions will definitely always trump this style in terms of slippage. Try to wipe your  behind your nose and ears often. Honestly, much of the slippage for me is simply due to skin being skin and releasing oil, sweating..:etc. That‘s all I‘ve got friend. Good luck."
thisismylifenow,feoy7ox,t1_feotsu3,1579307966.0,"You can go in and have the arms adjusted by basically any optical retailer (at least where I am) so they press into the sides of your head, or hook more sharply behind your ear. It will be uncomfortable at first but you get used to it.

Depending on your frames you can also get the bridge cushions adjusted. Nowadays most frames just sit plainly on your nose bridge without added arms for cushions but in the unlikely case you have wireframes, you can do that too. When I was a kid I used to just bend them into shape myself, tbh.

Even then, if you wear them for long enough the repeated use will eventually take you back to square 1. But you should be getting your eyes re-evaluated every 3-5 years anyway. Good luck fellow 4-eyes!"
instantkarma,feihunc,t1_fei6yy3,1579138881.0,"I agree with you, it‘s reckless af. It is, however, a little different from seeing a barrier come down when a train is oncoming and deciding to disregard it and endanger dozens of lives in order to save a little time, which is douchebaggery on a whole other level.

And I’m neither a former nor current truck driver; just a little too forgiving in general for the internet."
instantkarma,fehxw14,t1_fehnz26,1579126061.0,"Watch the video again. He attempts to drive around the arms BECAUSE he piles on the brakes and realises he’s still gonna careen into the crossing, stopping either with the cab in the way (the end of his life and likely dozens of others on the train), the excavator (very likely the same scenario) or the tail end of the trailer (best case). He did what he could given limited option in a bad situation.

Should he have been in the situation to begin with? Probably not; he was driving at speed down a hill coming around a corner. But we don’t know what kind of signage or warning system is in place up the road so we can’t for sure say he’s a dipshit/maniac."
