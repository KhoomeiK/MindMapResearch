NCSU,fevnhjj,t1_fetzjlr,1579399352.0,"Also, Roy's hatred of NCSU runs deep. Here he explains one of his reasons is because he had some douchy friends who picked on Carolina, and it bothered him.

NCSU,feu3m4w,t1_fetzjlr,1579382784.0,"I understand completely. For me, I think athletic program needs some humility. I can't help taking a little joy, after all my family is a house divided (State/Duke) and ABC is kind of a sports motto for us."
NCSU,fetghmf,t1_fetfdz5,1579375189.0,"Look, it's the Cardiac Pack, and I will stick with them through the good and the bad. 

That doesn't negate the fact that it is a joy to see UNC tied for last place in the ACC (after today's loss)."
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fej1g7k,t3_epc16h,1579153462.0,"Not entering. I wanted to say, as the sister who lost her brother to depression from addiction, thank you for taking your grief and creating a positive in the world. The man you love, had a terrible disease. I am so sorry that you and your children lost him. You fell in love with and created a family with him, but I am positive that he would be touched by the example you are to not only your children, but the world. Chin up buttercup. Love never dies."

Assistance,fej0s3l,t1_feiw2a4,1579152820.0,"Definitely  L.O.V.E. but cannot tell if it is Frank Sinatra or Nat King Cole. Both have similar phrasing on the song, and with other noise, I can't tell by the tone."
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fei8sud,t1_fei7v9v,1579132834.0,"Yes :) and yes to a point. By the end of the first season, you are technically done with where the storyline ends in the book. However, Margaret Atwood is an advisor for the show. Additionally, she would have been doing so during the time she was in the process of writing The Testaments (HT sequel). I am sure the series material from season 2 onward will have some similarities to the timeline Hulu has developed. The Testaments happens when June's children are older."
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fei7rvh,t1_fei7350,1579132178.0,"I really enjoy the flow to her writing. It's hard to say I enjoyed it because of the topic, but I find more in it each time that I read it. Just as the wrting/acting in the show compels you to have complex feelings for the characters, so does her writing. It is definitely worth the read. You just have to remember the book follows a timeline starting in the 1980s, not 2016 :) so some of the tech and language is out-of-date."

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fei58yl,t3_ep7n42,1579130569.0,"Oooo! I can't wait until the end of this semester, and I can include some pleasure reading back in my life. I get so wrapped up in a story, and sometimes, I end up binge-reading a novel in two days.

Unfortunately, I then procrastinate and end up not reading journal articles. 

Now, in no particular order:

Emma - Jane Austen  

The Handmaid's Tale - Margaret Atwood

Outlander - Diana Gaboldon

Game of Thrones series - G. R. R. Martin 

Anne of Green Gables - L.M. Montgomery"
