I can only imagine the trauma you’ve just experienced. I’ve only ever been at one deathbed, it took about a week and was fairly gentle and it wrecked me. You need to talk to a therapist.

Next, I’m not glad your Nmom died, but I am glad that you didn’t. I’m glad she got one thing right. If I had destroyed a relationship with my child to a point that she or he no longer wanted to see me, a chance to redeem myself would be a relief. 

This may be the only time in your life that your Nmom has ever acted like a true parent. Receive that in lieu of the lifetime of good mothering that she should have given you. Accept it as a gift, and not as a burden of guilt.

It does not negate all that she has done to make you go No Contact. You were still right to protect yourself and go NC. Please hear me. You were still right to go NC. You aren’t a bad child and *your Nmother death is NOT your fault*. 

You’ll never know what was in her mind and why she veered from her usual pattern of behavior and actually shielded you from harm. Perhaps she had a moment of clarity in the adrenaline of the moment and realized she’d harmed you and wanted a redeeming act. Perhaps she felt this was easier than Long term
Change. Perhaps she was suicidal.

Don’t let that redeeming act be an exit wound for your soul. That redeeming act doesn’t erase her past. It did one very good thing. It preserved your life. Take that ball and run with it. Have a glorious future. You deserve to be alive. You are so worthy."
