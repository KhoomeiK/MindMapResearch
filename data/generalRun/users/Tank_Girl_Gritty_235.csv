Tons of people are born into and even baptized into a religion before they can say their first word, only to hold no allegiance to it as an adult. If I find out someone actively attends masses and donates to the Catholic church, I'm done with them. If they don't do anything involving the church then hating them would be no different than hating someone based on their race or ethnicity. Another example would be Chris Pratt. His church isn't catholic, but is extremely outspoken against LGBT people and their human and civil rights. He made a big deal about joining and promotes them, so I don't go see his movies."

The whole movie is based on trying to outsmart Jack Nicholson and build a legal case against him for a wrongful death. The power and loyalty that comes with Nicholson's position and rank enables him to wiggle out of any evidence.
That final line of questioning is catching him in a lie and using his own ego against him. It's absolutely brilliant and everyone should watch it. The first video starts right after Nicholson has dodged all the expected questions that he's made sure to cover up.

I usually don't get so defensive online, but expanding medical care is something I've dedicated my entire life to and even risked my life doing. Most of my career was in high poverty areas. I saw the exact same illnesses and ailments in Baltimore, Maryland, USA that I did in refugee camps in Beirut, Lebanon. I have several friends with chronic illnesses they can't manage because care is so expensive. A few have restricted mobility because they couldn't afford to get a bone professionally set after they broke it My husband and I get ""free"" medical care from him being in the army. If not for that, just my one medication for multiple sclerosis is $65,000 a year. 
* What the US needs is more expansive care, period. The rich cunts will always want to skip the line, but the emergency departments will be less congested when people don't have to use them in place of a general practitioner. I don't even blame people for wanting to skip the line. I disagree with it, but I don't blame them. So many jobs require doctor's notes if you're going to miss a day. People rush the emergency departments or urgent care centers on Fridays to get a sick note in case they aren't better on Monday. It's such a mess."

This is a true story from my time as an EMT. I wrote it down a while ago, so I'm able to share it often, because it's a heartbreaking, visceral example of what for-profit health care does to those who can't afford it.:

I'll never forget the patient I always cite when talking about the state of health care in the United States:
We were called to a generic ""patient in distress"" and responded to a lower-middle class neighborhood where some kind strangers had seen a man collapsed by the road. They brought him into their home and called 911.
The smell was the first thing to hit me, and it wasn't anything I experienced before. We picked up plenty of drunks and homeless people. I've been splashed with more bodily fluids than I care to remember, but I had to really muster my strength on this one.

The man was beyond kind, which made realizing and telling him the gravity of his condition even harder. He'd been laid off when a factory purged workers and his life slowly unraveled into mostly-homeless. He was trying to walk to the shelter when he just couldn't keep his legs under himself anymore.
Cutting his pants from the ankle up to the knee exposed advanced gangrene that had spread above the knee on both legs. He said it started at his feet and asked if we wanted him to take off his shoes. I said no because I wasn't confident his foot would stay on.

What caused this?
Diabetes. He was on the brink of death, his only hope was surviving a double above the knee amputation and a sure case of sepsis because of fucking diabetes.
He'd lost his Healthcare and couldn't afford the metformin or insulin. Tight on money also meant whatever he could afford at gas stations with occasional fast food - compounding his diabetes. Clean socks, mild soap, lotion, and a pumice to care for his feet* might as well have been a Lamborghini. 

This man apologized for pieces of his flesh falling off in this nice couple's kitchen and in our ambulance. 
The kicker was we were a 20 minute drive from five hospitals. The number would jump into double digits if you made it 45 minutes. Johns Hopkins and University of Maryland Hospital are world class, and there are people dying of diabetes. Shit, I could see Johns Hopkins from the main road the subdivision was off of. 

I know this is an odd place to drop this story, but it's something that can't be shared enough. HIPPA barred me from ever knowing what happened to him, but I obsessively read the obituaries for weeks and never saw his name. His best case scenario was living wheelchair bound in a state facility after surgery and rehab that costs hundreds of thousands - if not millions - of dollars. He could have lived happily and worked for 30-40 more years if he was able to get real food, medicine, lotion, socks, and regular showers.

* Original comment:
* Clarification: This is from experience as an EMT and fire fighter. I'm talking about cases in which it is NOT an emergency and they have other means of transportation. They call 911 with minor injuries like a sprained ankle or an minor illness/irritation of chronic illness because they think an ambulance will automatically get them a room in the ER, skipping ahead of everyone in the waiting room. It doesn't. After triage by hospital staff, they can be taken to the waiting room if there are patients with more pressing matters who are already there.

The warmer weather also slows the dip in food sources during the winter, like frozen bodies of water blocking fish or plants losing berries and leaves. Unfortunately, they'll still dip to or closer to winter levels. Bears prepare for hibernation for months, so a sudden scarcity of food means they will be ill equipped to either rush start a hibernation (which also requires a substantial amount of food) or survive the winter without it."

AskReddit,ffc2t5x,t1_ffc1qaq,1579790129.0,"Yes, but also no. You're not going to get the same amount of bend and it's a lot more comfortable to raise your feet than bend like that, especialing if you're bearing down with constipation.
Humans have a muscle that's part of an evolutionary trait meant to keep us from popping easily while frightened or sneezing. When erect, our rectum in lynched off at the end by this muscle. We're designed to poop while squatting, a position that relaxes that muscle. This allows stool to pass more smoothly and easily.

You can accomplish this with anything you can prop your feet on, so the SP *is* a bit of a gimmick. The benefit being it tucks around the toilet when not in use and is more stable than a tiny stool or whatever you may have around the house. It's also only $25."

First off, $40k for a private is laughable. It's more like [$20k](https://www.militaryrates.com/military-pay-charts-e1_e5_2020).

Secondly, the US spends ridiculously unnecessary amounts on its military. Private contractors are being busted for charging $45 for a wing nut. Imagine how much a tank costs. They have absolutely no re-use system. If something breaks, it's trashed. No matter how small the break: trash. During the surge in Iraq, large bases (in Iraq) had lobster Fridays. Yes, every Friday crates if lobster would be delivered to feed the troops. People with clerical jobs who weren't authorized to leave their post were still given a personal armored vehicle that just baked in the sun all day. Truck broke down? Torch it.

AskReddit,ffbrysg,t1_ffbrf2s,1579780449.0,"While the pay isn't great, you get free health care, free* housing, free* food, free college, almost guaranteed job security, free training in said job, and removed from whichever toxic environment you grew up in. There are almost zero entry-level jobs that would provide that or provide and income to buy all that on your own. This is why poor people join the military.

* You get a housing and food stipend adjusted to the cost of living of where you live. If you're a single soldier, cost of housing never hits your paycheck. If you have a family, you choose to have a similar arrangement while living on post/base or they give you the lump sum and you find housing off base/post. You can choose to pay and eat elsewhere, but food for a single soldier will be provided at a cafeteria-type set up. If not a single soldier, it's $3 to eat there. Families receive a similar stipend for food that's automatically added to paychecks (regardless of living situation), adjusted to cost of living in your zip code."

The one ""good"" thing that I found in almost every person who truly struggles/have struggled: humanity. People who've had it the worst understand how much little things can matter.

Of course it's good to mitigate anger and drama, but some people take advantage of the fact that I'll bounce back and ""fix"" whatever is wrong.
