Our extensive military ensures the bullets land on foreign soil and in foreign bodies. 

How would an armed citizen prevent the Las Vegas Shooting? And how would a concealed carrier with a glock protect themselves and others in a Sutherland Springs church against an AR-556. 

I don’t think a militarized society would save anyone and I don’t really want to live in a nation that relies on firearms to solve mass murder. Other first world nations do not have this problem at this level in this century. Guns aren’t the answer."
