I work in an agency. The shittiest Wordpress setups did not hold a candle to the cluster fuck that were the Drupal setups

At least the fucking CMS looked useable compared to the piece of shit that is Drupal

And I’m a dev. The clients usually beg us to switch away from Drupal given how shitty the user experience is"

Only exception is if you literally got a first class connection to that company"

2.	Don’t know your YOE, but that seems like standard salary for German devs
3.	Probably. Get everything in writing in case they screw you though. Also get familiar with German labor laws?"

JETProgramme,fgjdtdr,t3_eylz7f,1580841951.0,"Pay the 5000yen or so to practice with a specialist, who’s usually an ex instructor (and if you’re a conspiracist like me, he’s probably in business with the driving school). 

He’ll give you a few hours practice and guidance on a makeshift course that’s very similar to the real thing.

I did that once or twice, and I passed the real thing on the first try.

Ask your coworkers, they’ll probably know someone that knows the specialist that they too used"

That’s gonna depend entirely on your company more so the individual. 

Do you reward performance regularly?

Do you have good WLB? Option to WFH as needed?

Good vacation policy? 

Competitive salaries?

Good environment?

The more you answer no to these questions, the more likely the candidate is to job hop."

The best general advice I could give is: go to the gym. Super easy to make friends. Got invited to a local basketball group, which led to more and more friends.
