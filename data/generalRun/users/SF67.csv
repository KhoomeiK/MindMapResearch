diving,fei9m7u,t3_ep4mad,1579133368.0,"For me, it’s not the location that matters but the instructors. When considering a dive shop that will get you through the process and teach you the how, what and when... it’s all about the instructors.
The world is full with beautiful places to dive and many dive schools. Pick a place where you’d like to dive and look for a PADI certified school with great and RECENT reviews.
Your first couple of days are in the pool (given you already learned the material for your written test) and you’ll be able to recognize the level of professionalism and integrity of your instructors.
Safety, safety and more safety is the most important thing.
Learning good diving habits are extremely important. 
This is how I would pick a school that teaches something so beautiful that could potentially severely hurt you or even kill you.
