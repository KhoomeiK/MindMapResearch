cats,ffphx9d,t3_eugs31,1580095464.0,I love seeing 7 black cats and 1 tabby. I feel like I should play the lotto or something.
Art,ffphnsx,t3_eugrg7,1580095283.0,"This is so good. I really felt compelled to study it for a few minutes. I especially love that you’ve given it almost a haze, another layer, especially in the shadow, left corner of the keys. It gives your painting a deeper dimensionality, and a strong photorealistic quality beneath that haze. You also have great brushstrokes. The work is finely detailed, but it seems to be minimal strokes and  not overworked at all, especially the paper. Wow."

interestingasfuck,ffiula1,t1_ffiuc9k,1579983109.0,"Journalistic photography was not meant to be subjective, nor art, even though it could elevate to that. My point is, these days, who can tell?"
rarepuppers,ffiug3c,t1_ffit7lp,1579983006.0,You don’t like memes. What do you get out of Reddit at that point? You can’t get away from memes here.
interestingasfuck,ffiu8uv,t1_ffitaxs,1579982860.0,Yes. This. “Straight photography.”
NatureIsFuckingLit,ffiooke,t3_ettssl,1579978918.0,The birb is more trusting than me.
interestingasfuck,ffiocx8,t1_ffign6n,1579978698.0,Agreed that photography can look different than the subject and that’s part of the art of it. But he never made El Capitan into a spaceship. It was always El Capitan. Not like advertising photography that would make an ice cube look like a vajayjay.
interestingasfuck,ffio4ze,t1_ffidjvh,1579978549.0,"There was a time when a photo indeed captured a moment in life. It captured a piece of “truth.” Even if the subject was contrived or controversial or meant to influence, it was physically what you saw in real life. There was a time when people didn’t think to alter photos. Photography of Ansel Adams and similar folks were real. Journalistic photos were real. Marketing has always been false, no trusting that."
WTF,ffinuk5,t1_ffi5c2p,1579978352.0,You are a beautiful human being.
interestingasfuck,ffino51,t1_ffi4isu,1579978233.0,"The physical effects are great and make them more real, but it’s all super contrived. Marketing photography has been dishonest (“a lie”) since forever it seems—they were mucking with images even in the 60’s and probably before."
interestingasfuck,ffi2mxz,t3_etr388,1579963279.0,I love the creativity and that these are more physical effects than digital—although there’s that too. I miss the days of absolute truth in photography.

NatureIsFuckingLit,ffd0wu3,t1_ffc8h6y,1579811236.0,"Funny you say this. My first thought when I saw the dinky donkey was “it looks like our cat.” We call him Sir Chonk, Sir Chonks-a lot or Sir Ker-chonk. He’s chonky. (But his “given” name is Nox)."

AnimalsBeingDerps,ff8zx4k,t1_ff8g2tk,1579701262.0,He is not deaf but is the most unusual cat I’ve ever had. He was orphaned at one week and his early kitten weeks were spent in a household full of dogs. We think he identifies somewhat as a dog. But also he’s intensely curious a helluva predator and gets into everything he can. Nothing stops him. Not even a vacuum. He’s Catdog.
