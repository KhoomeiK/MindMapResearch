IdiotsInCars,fg8nr8b,t1_fg8nl5p,1580625786.0,Yeah I’m color blind so if I do end up finishing my training and get my license then I can’t fly at night or during storms but yes flying easier than driving imo
OSHA,fg871eo,t1_fg844f1,1580611221.0,Yeah still ridiculous and Id never do that haha
OSHA,fg86zsr,t1_fg861dk,1580611188.0,Ha they are connected you can see the pin in the middle and at the beginning when he moves them you can see they are connected plus if you look down at what’s already put together you can see it
iamatotalpieceofshit,fg7zcfw,t1_fg7z9s6,1580605388.0,"Wow that’s ridiculous, hope moving out goes great for you"

IdiotsInCars,fg7hdsf,t1_fg7h96x,1580592562.0,Haha well yeah on snow there’s a lot of slip and if I’m doing donuts or anything it’s a lot easier to control with esc off because with it on it fights it the whole time
OSHA,fg73vzl,t1_fg73uce,1580583391.0,Ha no not safe in any way at all that’s not was I was saying I was just saying they won’t roll
OSHA,fg71ocz,t1_fg70b8z,1580581910.0,Most likely not those bars come with two connected together at the middle so they make an x so they can’t really roll unless the pin connecting them breaks
IdiotsInCars,fg70ghb,t1_fg6zm1d,1580581106.0,With my car I have to fully turn esc off to use launch control. The wheels just don’t slip much when launching there’s usually a small chirp but it is definitely launching it pulls pretty damn hard it’s probably because it’s awd that there’s not much slippage
ChoosingBeggars,fg6ltqa,t1_fg6lrdb,1580571335.0,This whole time you haven’t backed up a single statement with anything use your head
ChoosingBeggars,fg6lkhi,t1_fg61022,1580571152.0,If you can’t qualify your statement with anything why would anyone trust what your saying
IdiotsInCars,fg6lgj6,t1_fg6iymz,1580571075.0,Weird mine pressing it once won’t allow me to do launches I have to hold it down and fully turn it off

ChoosingBeggars,fg5ze8v,t1_fg5ujpj,1580545713.0,Yeah it’s immoral to have more money than other people. If we as a people think everyone should have the same amount of money across the board then we are in for some fucked up times.
IdiotsInCars,fg5yiyx,t1_fg5xum8,1580544515.0,That’s sort of what I guessed thanks
IdiotsInCars,fg5xi0v,t1_fg5wv8h,1580543129.0,It does make sense but with my car (s3) there’s almost no wheel slip with launch control at all and obviously it launches faster than just flooring it from stop with out launch control. So if I’m using it the rest of the drive will nor have regular esc ?
WTF,fg5wgvg,t1_fg5momx,1580541795.0,Fuck you funniest thing I’ve read in a while
IdiotsInCars,fg5wesp,t1_fg5neuw,1580541723.0,So I have a question my car has launch control and to do it I have to turn esc off but wouldn’t launch control require esc?
facepalm,fg5w1ln,t1_fg5vo75,1580541261.0,Yes that’s true but anomalies exist everywhere in all data in very small quantities that’s why they are factored out if 1% of a population is something then it is not considered a standard so not factually wrong you can’t say a very very small amount is different so the whole idea is wrong
Shitty_Car_Mods,fg5voez,t1_fg5gkql,1580540798.0,Honestly it’s almost impressive how unique this car is I’m not even mad

IdiotsInCars,fg5pszt,t1_fg5ognd,1580534557.0,This person doesn’t know what they are talking about I learned how to fly taking lessons to get my private pilots license I’m only a couple solos away from getting it and honestly flying is so much easier than driving. You can talk to most people in the sky there’s ground control at some airports telling you what order to land in or what elevation to pass at What routes to take etc and once you are in the air there’s almost nothing around you 99% of the time you don’t have to pay nearly as much attention. You don’t have people cutting you off no one merging into you don’t have to check heights of bridges to see if you fit don’t have to worry about staying in your lane as much. It honestly feels so much easier obviously the faa has so much more regulation because if you mess up you can kill a lot of innocent people at once and can cause catastrophic damage but once you are actually flying it’s not very difficult
ABoringDystopia,fg3oprp,t1_fg2uadr,1580486383.0,Yes but bill gates and Jeff bezos and other people like that still are 1% and considered rich there a lot of people who make much much less money who are 1% if you make 422 thousand you are considered 1% and plenty of people making that much work for their money
ABoringDystopia,fg2knxs,t1_fg20e39,1580446911.0,This applies to some rich people but some rich people really do work hard and earn their money not every high paying career is just moving money around

Damnthatsinteresting,fg2is37,t3_ewdkx3,1580445823.0,But what if I did learn this in school?
interestingasfuck,fg2ibti,t1_fg2cvhy,1580445561.0,Haha I thought the same thing a few years ago when I was in high school and now i do it every day
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffuwjzk,t1_ffuw74o,1580250693.0,Yeah I know plenty of mid 20 year olds in my trade with nice cars that they bought themselves

iamatotalpieceofshit,ff5z0mj,t1_ff5yrmn,1579614774.0,Well is it any worse than calling any white person American people do it all the time and no one freaks out saying it’s racist
WTF,ff5apyh,t1_ff4wut9,1579585448.0,One of my biggest pet peeves is when someone is in a bad car crash and say “thank god for keeping me safe” don’t thank god thank the safety engineers at Toyota
iamatotalpieceofshit,ff57r61,t1_ff4z8pg,1579582707.0,It’s really not an unreasonable assumption it does have the highest population so your more likely right then wrong guessing Chinese but either way look at any white person and guess what their European heritage they are. You would most likely be wrong it’s an honest mistake that’s not malicious so calm down
specializedtools,fetp1t8,t1_fetlzm7,1579377846.0,If they are brazing it is to keep the inside of the pipe clean. If you are doing lines like med gas you can’t have anything in the pipe. It comes sealed and you don’t want any particles in it if there is oxygen in the pipe it will burn leaving a Black layer of suit that you would not want inside pipe people breath from. The nitrogen in inert and won’t cause any burning or suit inside the pipe
iamatotalpieceofshit,feo8n7j,t1_feo8hbc,1579296643.0,So you don’t think an entire class giving you shit about something is bullying ?
iamatotalpieceofshit,feo6hsq,t1_fenzs3i,1579295818.0,I don’t agree with bullying but there is a little truth to saying bullying can help with some things like if your parents tell you to stop picking your nose most little kids don’t care at all but if they start getting made fun of by all of the kids in their class they may actually stop because then they realize it’s not socially acceptable

WTF,fdppvz0,t1_fdpnzea,1578636044.0,They aren’t doctors but saying it’s all bullshit is totally wrong my back goes out a couple times a year and is usually fucked up for a week and I can’t bend at all the whole low to mid back seizes up and I can’t do anything last time it happened I went to one and it made it instantly loosen up and I could touch my toes. Helped a lot more than any pain killers I had tried in the past
IllegalLifeProTips,fdpos9u,t1_fdp1ymw,1578634945.0,This isn’t me thinking life’s like law and order this is just what I have seen from people I know and it doesn’t take a genius to realize that when there are multiple eye witnesses saying this guy did this and here’s the evidence aka a bullet wound they will believe you. I don’t like cops either but if you think cops need video proof of an assault you don’t know anything about how police work. People are convicted of sexual assault with just one persons word and no evidence and you think a bulletin wound and multiple eye witnesses isn’t credible than you don’t know shit
IllegalLifeProTips,fdowo5j,t1_fdovycf,1578614582.0,I see the flaw except it’s how it works a lot of time time how about my boyfriend came to my house beat me up and left you know what happens most of the time they go arrest the boyfriend plus this guy has multiple of his friends as witnesses they usually would 100% go arrest the shooter
IllegalLifeProTips,fdop2ui,t1_fdodrbx,1578609713.0,I don’t know man the bullet wound is enough proof usually when you say this guy shot me. They tent to believe that
