F1TV,fep0ces,t1_fen5h1r,1579309305.0,Thanks for your reply. I tried Safari on my Mac laptop but that just said intializing when I tried to view the races (although other things like Chasing the Dream worked).
F1TV,feozsj3,t1_fenpz2z,1579308959.0,"Thanks for your reply. Yeah, that’s what I have but choosing the language doesn’t add commentary for some reason. English is ticked but upon exiting that pop up, the screen turns sideways"
