NatureIsFuckingLit,fdqru8p,t1_fdq9jp5,1578673525.0,I’m literally a huge goose bump. This is disgusting.
TrueOffMyChest,fdkxa24,t1_fdkavrj,1578513057.0,Yes! I’d like the link too please! you’ve just changed my life lol
motherinlawsfromhell,fd14mzj,t1_fd059kp,1578127523.0,You’re right. It hasn’t been great. I spoke up and he’s more hurt about me saying I want my distance from his family than his mom causing me to say that. Insane. Definitely eye opening.
bipolar,fd14dp4,t1_fczwnmg,1578127447.0,"SO THERE’S HOPE?! 
Aw this is good to know. Many options and it’s not a total curse."
bipolar,fcy9g0p,t3_ejj413,1578076628.0,"That’s hilarious! Lol 
But on a serious curious note...how is teaching with bp? The goal was to become a teacher but as a special ed paraprofessional, I’m already super stressed. I’m only dealing with admin and students...no parents yet!!!"
TooAfraidToAsk,fctip5w,t3_eisqt8,1577944627.0,"24 here. Just enjoy your youth. I wish I didn’t spend too much time being anxious about what I should get done by a certain age. I haven’t gotten anything I put on my to do list done, but the path that my life put me through got me through a lot of BETTER options than the ones I thought I had through my plan. Lol wow that may only sound good in my head. 

Enjoy your youth. Things will turn out how it should. Oh also, get mental help at the first sign you need it. AND SELF CARE!!! I wish I did that. I swear I was just 17 last year. It goes by way too fast."
motherinlawsfromhell,fctfaki,t1_fcszndi,1577941416.0,Right?! I’d except her to call me out if I said some messed up stuff to her about her son. I’m not sure how my bf would feel. I’m think VLC but I also want to respect my S.O while respecting myself as well. She blows up so easily so confronting her might be too much for me. I don’t have the energy to keep up with her and her drama.
