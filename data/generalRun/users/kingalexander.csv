GetMotivated,ff46v70,t1_ff3sblj,1579556833.0,"The idea of improving from year to year is redundant if your intial metric is day to day. It‚Äôs always trending positive because it‚Äôs more finite than yearly. 
My logic states that your standard to be better every day than the day before can be lower than if I stated my goal is X over Y period of time while taking days off.
The principle reason is because your limited daily adherence.

IE saving a penny everyday is worse than saving$5 once at the end of the year bc of the net."
GetMotivated,ff3p3be,t1_ff39jm0,1579545811.0,"So if we apply mathematical principals just presume you improve the smallest possible amount everyday no matter what. It‚Äôs consistent and always trending positive. The net improvement can total less than if you took a vacation of doing nothing (didn‚Äôt get better each day) then were able to improve in a more efficient manner in the days after.

The standard for improvement can hinder your ceiling if you only compare yourself to the day before.
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with getting better everyday, I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs not the only principle to apply for improvement."
