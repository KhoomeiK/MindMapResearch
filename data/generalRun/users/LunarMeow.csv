Yeah, being a responsible meat eater does often mean buying less meat due to cost. It does for me.

Eat the dinner on the porch watching the horses graze in the field across the way. Have some more wine and do naked stuff, watch a movie or play backgammon, hit the hay. 

Cold Season: Sleep in but don't lay around quite as long, load up the dogs and ski gear in the truck, downhill all morning, xc with the dogs in the afternoon. Just xc if theres no new snow. Take a long hot shower back home, tidy a bit, eat some comfort food. Movie or backgammon, sex, sleep."

Cards against humanity is an excellent indicator of whether or not you're going to get along with someone/a group of people depending on how hilarious you find their choices.

We had CAH at a bar I used to work at, and I was subjected to overhearing many games. Sometimes, they would be fucking hilarious. Super clever references, or dry deadpan responses, you could tell they were trying to get into the mind of whoever's turn it was so they would be picked and gain points.

Other times, it would just be a group of people who couldn't restrain their childlike glee upon seeing words like 'diarrhea' or 'midget penis' or 'a priest slapping you in the face with his balls' and would proceed to put those cards in anywhere regardless if they fit the premise or not. Approximately 12% of their punchlines made sense, they mostly just heard 'pee pee poo poo' and fucking lost their shit like they were sitting upon the peak of comedy. I almost killed myself with a bar spoon that night."

AskReddit,fejj5hl,t3_ephq0x,1579176492.0,"This still physically hurts me to think about. It might not seem so bad written out but trust, I am still traumatized by this memory.

So at this time, I'm dating an artist who is attending a classical painting academy somewhere in Europe. I've never been to his school or anything like that but I didn't much care to. Except one day, I left my phone at his place, and he brought it to school with him to give me later.

So I walk into this school to fetch my phone from him, and theres a comfy little atrium with a red curtain pulled across the opening to the rest of the space. I didn't even pause to consider the curtain, just pushed it back and strolled right into the quiet space. I waved to the other painters, some of whom I knew, and the nude model posing in the center with an atmosphere-demolishing ""Hey!"" I walked up the stairs to the open loft where my SO was painting and his teacher was in the middle of an in-depth critique.

""Hey I'm so sorry to interrupt, I just need my phone so I can connect with my tutor and I'll be out of your hair""

The two of them ignored me completely me. My SO was clearly stressed and his instructor was shooting the loudest, strongest ""fuck you"" vibes towards me I could almost physically feel them and I suddenly considered crying. I slunk back down the stairs to the main room and once again beheld the scene before me and the red curtain in the doorway. That's when I realized that the curtain was there to keep randoms from entering while there was a nude model working and the students were concentrating. So, the thing that I absolutely did, loudly and unabashedly. My embarrassed blush sunk until I paled completely and I continued slinking until I got all the way outside. I briefly considered walking until I drowned myself in the river.

My SO's instructor chewed him out good for having such a fucking stupid girlfriend."
AskReddit,fejinaw,t3_ephq6x,1579175911.0,"New to the city and poor as fuck, I needed another job. Got one working at the summer Saturday market scooping daal and masala at a food vendor's tent. 

Waking up at the buttcrack of dawn, meeting my boss and helping him unload his van and set up the tent in frigid weather. And by helping, I mean he showed me how to do it once and then I did it for him after that. I took orders (friendly and smiling!), worked the register and served all the food, he chilled in the back idly grilling cheese or bullshitting with the crepe guy next door.

He promised me 12 bucks/hr but after my first shift he insisted he had said 10. That was barely going to cover me. I ended up stealing one twenty out of his till at the end of every day. That guy sucked."
AskReddit,feji4vg,t3_ephr24,1579175287.0,"Oh god, isn't it always a relationship and ignoring the first red flag? 

I'm sure others can relate to this. I met a guy 7 or 8 years older than me when I was just a baby (21). I fell hard for him, he just seemed so mature, strong and honorable. I was planning to move to the big city in our state after college, and I asked if he wanted to come with me. He was a defense contractor so he had *plenty* of money and a flexible schedule. He didn't want to sublet a room in a house (like my poor ass was planning on doing) so he said he'd rent us a studio apartment and pay rent until I got a job. I covered utilities and most of the groceries with savings while I looked for a job. 

It was about 10 weeks until I found something. The *night before* my first payday, I come home and my boyfriend has moved the mattress out of our bedroom and into the living room and is lying there in the dark. I ask him what's going on and he ignores me. I turn on the lights and ask again, getting worried now. Without looking at me, he just says, ""I'm just wondering if you were ever planning on contributing to this apartment and our life or if you're happy just using me for a free ride."" 

I'll never forget the feeling of my stomach dropping out of my body. I reminded him of our agreement and he denied ever having made such a promise to me. That's when I learned what a pathological liar was. And it was the first time he broke my heart. 

Had I known then what I know now, I would have walked out that night. Instead I cried and apologized, and the next morning I went to the ATM and withdrew my entire first paycheck and gave it to him. 

The next two years of my life were hell. Read red flags people, don't be so scared of being alone that you stay with someone awful."

AskReddit,fejh53g,t3_ephxew,1579174008.0,"My great-grandmother's sapphire ring. 

Really beautiful slender but fairly large emerald cut with intricate filigree around the setting. My great-grandmother wore it when she immigrated to the US and refused to sell it even during their most dire circumstances. 

My mom got it next and she wore it every day until the band broke. She set it in a box on her bedside table until it could be fixed and her shitty, abusive addict first husband stole it and pawned it. She was so distraught she didn't stop crying for three days. The dickhead had a moment of clarity and bought the ring back, making up a stupid story. My mom knew better. He walked out on her and my two brothers not long after that but she was just glad he was gone and happy she got her ring back. 

She tells me all the time that the ring will protect me and the eldest daughter of every generation after me. I recently had to fix the band again since I haven't taken it off in about twelve years and it's worn quite thin."
