""Why do drug addicts get free needles but my diabetic mother has to pay for them?""

Then you explain how needle exchanges actually save money overall by reducing the need for expensive HIV and Hep-C treatment by reducing transmission rates, but they still don't give a shit. 

It isn't actually about the money - it is a morality thing and they're just assholes."

tifu,fdqsp9z,t1_fdqjieh,1578674052.0,"For me the difference is in experience with weed, too. My wife likes edibles, but dialing in the perfect dose is so tricky that she has essentially given up on them. If she takes a little too much, she spends the whole time freaking out about whether or not it is going to get more intense.

For me, if I do too much, I think ""oops, I'm higher than I wanted to be"" and then eat a bag of chips and pass out. I don't get to that point of intense anxiety just because I'm really comfortable with the effects of cannabis whereas she isn't as experienced."
TwoXChromosomes,fdqpnwo,t3_emf9fe,1578672181.0,"Former stay at home dad here. Can't really say much about his issues with your body, other than to say that he is totally in the wrong and would likely benefit from therapy.

I wanted to chime in a bit on the transition to being a stay at home father. I also went into it after unsuccessfully trying to start my own business, so I can relate somewhat. I had a breakdown in the first week and it took me a little bit to get things under control.

It is a huge change, especially since society is not always accepting of a stay at home father (don't get me wrong here - I'm not making any sort of claim that men who stay home with their kids deserve extra praise for doing what women have been doing forever). There are lots of little things that make you feel uncomfortable or like you should be doing something different, from annoying comments from cashiers about being ""out for a day with daddy"" to the lack of change tables in men's washrooms (seriously, super frustrating). 

It can be a hard transition and he may need extra support, and those feelings may be manifesting in other ways (not to excuse his behaviour at all - just offering a possible explanation). If this is the case, he *needs* to walk to someone about it. Please don't let him bottle it up and come to resent your children.

That said, it was by far the most rewarding year of my life and I feel much more connected to both of my children than I would have otherwise. I cried like a baby when it was time for my daughter to go to school and my son to go to daycare."
