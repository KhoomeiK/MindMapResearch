TooAfraidToAsk,fexvlos,t3_equxz5,1579437162.0,"There are physical conditions that are not scary but can disrupt or prevent your cycle. Two of the most common are being severely underweight or being significantly overweight.  Whatever the cause, it’s better to know. Being brave enough to visit a doctor when you suspect something is wrong means early treatment and better outcomes. Good luck!"

AskReddit,ferlbyf,t3_eqg2hc,1579355393.0,"In healthy relationships you avoid doing things that you know will hurt your partner. If your partner is ok with it, then, it’s ok. That goes for porn, or gambling, or eating all the Cheetos in the middle of the night. If you are sneaking around because you know (or strongly suspect) your partner will be hurt and upset, then it’s NOT ok."

Advice,fdm1l8x,t3_em2zax,1578537636.0,It’s normal for you simply because your brain associates the pain of ear infections with getting water in your ears.  Other people won’t have the same reaction.

relationship_advice,fdlihcg,t3_elzs96,1578524744.0,"I wouldn’t make a big deal over this. What can be gained by expressing your disappointment? You can’t make them be excited for you. If you focus on  how excited and happy your own friends and family are, you will be able to enjoy the planning and actual event so much more."
AskWomenOver30,fdldmi6,t3_elzswx,1578521770.0,I might date some as much as 10 years younger than me. I’m in my mid 50’s. But i would never date someone who was closer to my kids ages (early 20s) than they were to my age. That would feel weird to me.
AskCulinary,fdld9ny,t3_elzt1a,1578521553.0,"Learn how they do things and build your reputation as someone who listens to and cares out instructions. After you have been there awhile, you can offer suggestions for ways to improve the process, but don’t do that when you are really new."

Advice,fdjz1ob,t3_elsof1,1578491865.0,"The only way you know if you are making a good product is to get feedback from product testers. Maybe your friend doesn’t have female friends and sees your sister as his best shot at getting a woman’s opinion. OR maybe he would like to be introduced to your sister and thinks that talking to her about whether she likes the skin product would smooth out the awkwardness of talking to a beautiful woman. Which it would, and is kind of ingenious. Either way, you either trust him to act appropriately around your sister or you don’t. Make your decision based on that rather than what he says is his motive."

TooAfraidToAsk,fdjvexw,t3_els9do,1578488784.0,"One reason is that many people believe that it’s not the role of the government to restrict every substance or activity that has some risk. My government is not my parent. The US has many many laws that make activities that don’t hurt any one other than the person doing it into a crime. These “victimless crimes” make a person a criminal for nothing more than making less than perfect personal choices. For example, many motorcyclists believe that the decision to wear a helmet or not should be their own decision to make."
