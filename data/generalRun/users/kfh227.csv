I'm 6'0"" and the one time I dated a woman 6'0"" it was weird.  I can't explain it.

The end of date kiss.  Have him walk you to your car and just square up with him (stand face to face) and get that kiss!  He probably will be up for it.  Just might be worried about going to fast.

here's the deal .... go out and have drinks/apps at a bar.  Do touching, like grab his knee.  Even joke that you want to be closer and scooch your chair right up next to his.  I bet you'll kiss at the bar.  It just will happen at one point.

If you are sitting at table for dates across from eachother it's to hard to initiate physical contact."

You had a date on Wednesday so if you go on a date 4 days later ..... this is a good cadence.  If she reaches out to you, chat!  During work, you can alwayssay ""I have a meeting to get ready for, I need to get going"".  She'll be fine with that.  Then jsut tell her that you'll text her tonight.

After date 2, just talk about texting frequency.  Everyone is different.  Even ask if phone calls are preferred, etc."
