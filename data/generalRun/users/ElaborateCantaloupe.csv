Right, but that's not what you said. Using your logic, you could say that most transwomen are not beaten (it's true. Most are not.) so then we should assume that it's not a problem that needs to be addressed. That's bad logic.

Since you think this is a statistic question, how many cis-women who dress in drag need to be harassed or beaten in order for it to be considered the same as cis-male drag? I realize they aren't beaten enough for you to consider it the same so I'm wondering what the number is. Maybe a percentage is easier?"

The reason I believe that is because it is 100% factually true. I understand that even if it wasn’t lawful that I could still secretly be fired for being gay but at least the law is on my side if that happens.
