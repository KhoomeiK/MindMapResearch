Yogscast,ffjaur8,t1_ffj12pn,1579994440.0,"I feel like that's Lewis' fault. He recently brings a lot of chaotic energy into the things he's in. Maybe he thinks he has to drive everything. He for sure needs to relax a bit on that. You could really notice that in the video and also in the last YogPod, where Lewis thought he had to shoulder the whole thing and didn't even trust, that Simon would have put in any effort. (But it turns out Simom did and does put in effort)

memes,ffbojj9,t1_ffbj8e1,1579775818.0,"Being fat isn't irreversibe though, especially if you have not grown up as overweight. 

The problem with being overweight is that people think you have no discipline and don't know how to take care of yourself. Doesn't matter if you earn mad money. The barrier for ""entry"" might be lower, but being overweight is basically a negative status effect. 

When I look for a partner, they could be perfect in every other way, but if they are too overweight, I would not feel safe starting a family with them for health reasons most of all."
creepy,ffbnztx,t1_ffb06jx,1579774998.0,"Well look no further than China and whatever secret projects could go on in Russia. The stuff (like gene-editing on humans) is actively discouraged by the international scientific community but China gives no fucks and is already using CRISPR in studies on people.

It's a highly volatile system though and tends to backfire quite a bit, as we are not really that good at controlling it yet. But someone might be able to figure it out in the near future and then you get Chinese blonde haired super soldiers."

Doesn't matter where you go to in the end, if it's a good resource. You could even just tell them that you are shy about it and they probably would understand. I assure you, loads of dog and cat people are just as weird and awkward as you and I. ;)"

If he became a bunch larger, I'd be more suspicious. This photo is just the typical pump & dehydrate tactic that Hugh Jackman, Henry Cavill and the like use for a 1 day thing. He clearly is not this vascular and jacked getting out of bed. I am a regular dude and in the gym with a pump I get isanely vascular and toned while I am normal on an off-day. Also, notice the prefect lighting in that photo.

Hell, give me a year with a personal trainer and nutritionist sanctioned prepared meals and I'll match or out-do his physique if going to the gym was my job."

I love the program and all the lifts, but I think I should switch to a 3 day Full Body routine. **Does anyone know a free 3 -day routine that is also based on the compound lifts I love (Deadlift, Squat, Bench, Overhead Shoulder Press) ?** 

Preferably not keeping me in the gym for 2+ hours. 


I feel like I waste a lot of potential gains keeping up with PPL but not actually getting in enough sessions for a meaningful progression."
Fitness,fddzt3o,t1_fddwerq,1578327934.0,"Most direct answer in my head would be: Train abs more frequently. I do abs after every work out ([leg raises with straight legs](https://youtu.be/fhrkw1aaP8k?t=173) laying on my back or hanging from a bar). I workout about 3 days a week and always end with leg raises, while also doing them sometimes on off days.

If you actually are not at full creatine storage already from red meat and such, you can supplement it and cause more water to be stored in your muscle tissue. That would make your muscles appear larger (due to it also increasing surface area of your muscles it also makes you slightly stronger).
