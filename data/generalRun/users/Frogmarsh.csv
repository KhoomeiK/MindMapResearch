I don’t know why Griffin Grady didn’t play this season but you’d think he or Christian Bell would have been set up well to possibly start next season. Bradrick Shaw would have been in a good spot to push for a starting spot, but Nakia Watson probably has the early downs locked up, and Jalen Berger is no joke, so for Shaw it makes sense. I’m disappointed to see Aron Cruikshank depart; I don’t understand the reasoning behind that at all."

I think some players simply didn’t perform. Dee Ford and Justin Houston underperformed at the end. His inside linebackers weren’t suited for the demands of the 3-4. Eric Berry was non-existent at the end. It’s hard to make up for flaws in all levels of the defense."

He fails to understand that two of their three starting corners are free agents and they lack the money to invest here while also addressing Patrick Mahomes and Chris Jones. Besides, after Tanoh Kpassagnon’s emergence, and the return of Alex Okafor and Breeland Speaks, they have no need for ends. Baun is not an off-the-line linebacker... this is a bad pick."
