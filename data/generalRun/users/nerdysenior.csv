socialskills,fffehup,t3_etagpk,1579882201.0,I find it depends whether these people are friendly to begin with.  My husband and I attended a party not knowing many people and the ones that knew each other totally ignored us no matter what we tried to talk about with them.  Fortunately we met a nice couple and spent some time with them before they went to be with the others.  My husband and I are not shy but that was the most unpleasant experience at a party we ever had.  Thank goodness we at least had each other to talk to  lol.
