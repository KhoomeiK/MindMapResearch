Just remember whatever the outcome of the apology comes out or whether he want to meet you, please love yourself more and always remember you already did your part to pull yourself together and apologised. If he didn’t want to accept the apology with grace, he is just another petty guy.

Fried rice is best cooked with overnight rice.

I eyeball all the measurements I will try my best to not be weird.

Prepare:
2 bowls of rice
1 Hotdog (I used Valley Chef Brand - Damn good I tell ya)
1 Wind-Dried Chinese Sausage (another name is wax sausages - highly recommend, but if you can’t find, add Mushroom Pork Balls - I used Lion Dance Brand)
2 eggs
Salt
Pepper
Chili Padi (Baby Red Chili, I like it because it’s spicy) (Optional)
Light Soy Sauce (Optional)

Preparation:
1. Slice Chinese Sausages about 2mm thick
2. Slice Hotdog anyhow you like, you can make heart shape or octopus shape
3. Beat the eggs together

Cook:
1. Put oil in your pan, let it sit to heat up
2. Lower to low heat, add Chinese Sausage
3. Stir-fry it until you can see it’s a little like crispy and add the Hotdogs and stir-fry it till a LIL char on the side for all the flavours to come out (It will smell really good now)
4. Put it on a plate
5. There should be oil left over from the Chinese Sausage, and Hotdog
6. Medium heat, add the eggs. (Do keep swirl your egg so it won’t get too solidified too quickly)
7. When it’s fluffy and half done, add the rice 
8. Stir-fry for around erm 1 min, add the Chinese Sausages and Hotdog
9. Stir-fry it for like 1 min, add a pinch of salt and pepper
10. Serve with Chopped Chili Padi (And Light Soy Sauce if you like it salty)

Let me know if you like it ! 

Edit: Step 10: Is served like condiments on the side."
