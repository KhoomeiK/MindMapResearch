HaloStory,fem2gx4,t3_eovkye,1579237573.0,"Humanity’s biggest advantage is obviously its AI. Why are humans, with human reflexes and human reaction times, piloting the ships and aiming the guns when an AI could do everything better? Faster? More precise? Imagine an AI in command of a fleet of drone ships, perfectly coordinating their movements and formations and firing solutions, optimizing everything right down to the decimal point. The covenant wouldn’t stand a chance. It would be like their ships were moving in slow motion. 

And on the ground, you’re telling me that modern warfare in 500 years is still dudes in body armor firing machine guns at each other? Where are all the robots? Who needs an overpriced Spartan that takes years to train when you can just flood the battlefield with robot vehicles, infantry, and air support all perfectly coordinated by an AI commander.  What chance does a squad of elites have against a robotic sniper that can fire off perfectly calculated head shots from a mile away?"

In my experience they always ask the family. I've seen a few times when the family has overridden a patient being a donor but I've never seen the procurement people override a family who doesn't want the organs donated. This is just my experience in several ICUs in one state. I would love to know how often a state procurement agency overrides a family. Seems like a PR nightmare, honestly."

I’m a surgery resident at a major regional transplant center, I’ve been to the committee meetings where they review patients and approve who gets on the list. Medical condition is the most important factor but to get on the list you need to be cleared by a psychologist, not have active substance abuse issues, have a decent social support system, be able to afford the anti rejection meds. All of that factors in.

Edit: also “too sick to get a transplant” is a judgement call made by doctors. Heart disease, vascular disease, any kind of cancer, all can be disqualifying factors. I have watched surgeons and nephrologists argue about this stuff for hours at selection committee."
