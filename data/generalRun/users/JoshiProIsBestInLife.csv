AskReddit,ff1pnjr,t1_ff1m7rc,1579483387.0,"They have short promos (a minute or two) where they can say their little bit to say how they are feeling or how they feel about their opponents also they have a part after the last match of the night where the winner of the last match usually the champion at the time will say a few words but their next challenger might turn up to act tough and make threats to further that story. People are allowed to issue challenges for various belts then by declaring it on the microphone.

 The overarching story in Wrestling is largely the same ongoing one everywhere in every company. You have a belt. I want it. Give it to me or i will kick your ass and take it.

Everybody will have their little arc though. One example was about these three people. Tam Nakano, Mayu Iwatani and Arisa Hoshiki. They were all in a larger group called STARS made up of 5 or 6 Women but the story was about those three. Mayu and Tam were a tag team and they were working really well together, they genuinely liked each other. However, Mayu's old partner Arisa from way back returned and wanted to reform with Mayu. This pissed Tam off a lot. She felt abandoned and resentful of Arisa. Arisa wanted to be friendly with Tam. Whenever STARS were in a match Tam would stand as far away from Arisa as she could at all times. A few times Tam refused to tag in to the match because Arisa was doing the tagging. This led to a match to settle the matter. They beat the hell out of each other. The match went to a draw so they decided that fighting each other was dumb. They get along for the sake of the unit but are not friends.

That is an example of a story that can be stretched out over weeks. One piece at a time."
AskReddit,ff1icp2,t1_ff1egaz,1579479683.0,"That is a great question. I do not honestly know if i can adequately communicate the answer but i will give it a go. I consider it a combination of both. The actual match quality is second to none (i am very biased though). It's hard, fast and they manage to tell the story through the actual matches rather than relying on telling the audience what is going on. A lot of companies rely on the commentators to say things like ""he is targeting his arm because it is weakened due to the moves earlier"" when we can see that the arm is a problem. We have eyes. Japanese Women's Pro-Wrestling by and large has no commentary. You figure it out by watching. When someone is scared they look scared. You can see it.

The Women in Japan are athletically built a lot come from sports into Wrestling for some reason. They train every day and improve rapidly because everyone wrestles everyone at some point, rookies will take experienced veterans in a match at some point and they learn little bits and pieces from them. They have shows spaced out without much travel (they mainly stay in Japan) which means they go harder during their matches. It's exciting to watch because they are willing to push it to make it look as legit as possible without injuring each other. They also are presented as being cool rather than hot. That helps."
