bridezillas,ff40b8t,t1_ff40377,1579552756.0,I am sorry that it’s so emotionally stressful for you. Try setting boundaries. Or keep telling yourself this: the bride does not own you. Only you can be in control of what choices you make and how you feel about them.
bridezillas,ff3zhh0,t3_eri7a1,1579552244.0,"Good luck. From your other responses I sense you are committed to trying to work through this. As a total outsider to the situation, I would suggest you 1) try to patch things, be more openly communicative and if that doesn’t work, 2) be extremely honest and say this isn’t right for you and bail. 

Leverage your 10 years of friendship to reason with her for whatever it is you need a break from. Think about what your boundary is — will you skip the trip to Austin, but deal with any other wedding shit close to they day? Or is your boundary that you can only spend ONE weekend each month on assisting with planning? Talk to the Bride about your needs and see if she’s reasonable and agreeable. If she can’t be, then run far away."

Seattle,feepv4a,t3_eokm7g,1579038699.0,"Unfortunately I don’t know much about the construction, but the light rail into Seattle is very convenient from the airport. A normal ride from SeaTac to westlake would be ~45 mins, so figure your addition from there. 

If you have an early morning or late evening flight (upon landing, or when you’re headed back) be sure to check if the light rail runs at that time.

Enjoy your trip!"

careerguidance,fdnttox,t3_emcgok,1578592701.0,"I think your attitude is misplaced.  It’s OK to be reclusive and private, but not to the point of being rude. 

You don’t have to have long conversations or become too involved with “friends” at work. But a greeting when you enter and leave work is a courtesy... it should just be expected. Even “quiet people” should demonstrate respect for others. 

Based on what you shared, I bet your coworkers feel you are an entitled asshole who thinks you are better than them. Smile and say hello, and I think that could turn around."

Your sister regrets her choices and admires yours. Many people have a difficult time admitting to themselves they made a mistake, even less so to admit it to someone else. She’s angry with her life, just does not know where to direct that anger."

careerguidance,fckdbpm,t1_fcjhxf0,1577722774.0,"A personal story might help here... I could have written the same post 14 months ago. I felt intense stress about whether to leave or stay at the job. My incredible doctor vouched for me to take a medical leave bc my physical anxiety symptoms were destroying my health. The time off the job helped me see, with clarity, I needed to GTFO. I quit while on leave and never walked back into the office. 
I’m still struggling to find what I want to do, but my health and wellness are supremely better. I can’t use that place for references either, and I hate it. It just boiled down to choosing to prioritize my mental health over my financial wealth. 

So, quit. You will not regret it. And you will be able to explain the absence of references from this place to a perspective employer in a judicious way."

books,fcc27ei,t3_egyz63,1577593580.0,"Totally agree on the struggle here. Some others made great recommendations for how to make the decision based on the purchase. 

One comment I want to add: I worked at Barnes & Noble for several months this past year and learned it can be just as evil as Amazon. In my town, unfortunately people consider B&N “local.” So, if you choose to support physical bookstores, make sure it’s an INDEPENDENT bookstore. Any big-box place sucks their employees dry and could care less about their customers."
suggestmeabook,fcbya37,t1_fcbx6dn,1577592315.0,"Very fair. I didn’t remember whether she condemns it or not. But, I take her honesty about it as a sign of authenticity — she never covers it up. In fact, the whole book is practically about his closeted sexuality!"
