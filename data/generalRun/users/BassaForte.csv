cubase,ffam2wb,t3_esjwa5,1579739138.0,"No offense and this is a great place to come for questions specifically regarding Cubase, but both of these questions would probably be best answered by your teacher. It is an audio class, after all.

Since your first question is somewhat Cubase related, you can just drag wav files (and other audio files) into the timeline. The correct options depend on other factors like your projects sample and bit rate. You should ask your teacher about those. 

The second question I'm having a hard time understanding, but I think by the white line above the clip, you're referring to the clip's volume control. You might have dragged that accidentally while the imported value is always 0db. That is not the actual volume of the track / clip - you should look at the mixer window for that."

feedthebeast,few8p5y,t1_few7xs8,1579406960.0,"Ahh, yes! You're right. You just add the parameter _""NoAI:1""_ to the curly braces, so the full command to spawn a peaceful player mob would be _""/summon headcrumbs:human ~ ~ ~ {Username:BassaForte,NoAI:1}""_

Thanks for your help!

EDIT: Upon further inspection, this isn't quite what I want. It makes them peaceful, yes, but since AI is disabled, they don't move at all (or even react to physics / punches).

EDIT2: Figured it out. You want to add _""Attributes:[{Name:generic.followRange,Base:0}]""_ as a parameter and omit the NoAI, so the full command would now be _""/summon headcrumbs:human ~ ~ ~ {Username:BassaForte,Attributes:[{Name:generic.followRange,Base:0}]}""_"
feedthebeast,few1lgb,t3_eqqykn,1579404183.0,"Aha, after some more trial and error, I figured out the problem.

I took the command example too literally, and didn't realize _""headcrumbs.human""_ was not valid. The correct syntax is _""headcrumbs:human""_.

So for anyone else with the same question, _yes_, you can spawn player mobs and the command is _""/summon headcrumbs:human ~ ~ ~ {Username:BassaForte}""_

EDIT: I have a followup question... after doing my own research and checking the config files, I'm unsure if there is a way to make the player mobs passive or peaceful (not hostile)."
