simracing,ff6pb4w,t3_erwdoc,1579632054.0,"Hope this doesn't come across as judgemental as I'm genuinely curious, but why do so many sim racers spend big money on racing seats from Sparco, momo, omp etc?

They seem completely unnecessary for a non-motion rig and obviously the safety features/quality they have are irrelevant. Is the comfort worth the cost?"
treeplanting,fehb43d,t3_ep5ty3,1579112909.0,"I would go with the higher tree price personally. The most you stand to gain with the free camp costs is 25/day. However, once you've figured out how to plant, that 0.03 difference could easily end up being 50/day or more depending on your skill and effort."
todayilearned,fecc1h7,t1_fec8qdz,1578970457.0,"Not always. Certain forest types, especially those that depend on fire for succession, are virtual monocultures pre-harvest and experience a greater biodiversity post-harvest.

Also don't confuse the planting of one species of tree with being a representation of what that forest will become. Although some licensees will attempt to inhibit competition in the first few years of growth, these forests will then grow for another half century at least uninhibited. 

In my experience, very few people can tell the difference between a planted cutblock at year 30 and a 'natural forest'. At least here in western Canada."
todayilearned,fecarqi,t1_fec5vz2,1578969748.0,"That region from south of Hinton towards Grand Cache is actually where a lot of Canada's first real efforts to reforest land cleared for forestry began. Back then the province paid for all of the trees and labor and thus were willing to spend a little extra on all the signage.

The same practices exist today, however, the planting is all the responsibility of the licensee."
todayilearned,fec5quc,t1_fec32in,1578967070.0,"This is completely false, most of the timber in the park was, and still is, completely non-merchantable. There were fears towards the end of the 19th century that clear cutting to open up land for agriculture would threaten the several important headwaters in the area so the park designation was made."
