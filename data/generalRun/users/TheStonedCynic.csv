Futurology,ffduvb3,t1_ffdndk7,1579829505.0,"No. The reason the Trumps of the world get elected is because of people like you who think participating in a silly multiple-choice popularity contest in an evidently corrupt system is going to produce significant changes for us in urgent times. Sure, your vote will hold more power in local elections, but the electoral college nullifies the power you possess when it comes time to vote for president. 

Our system is a machine that runs on corruption from all ends to keep us working for the rich and powerful, no matter what party is in charge. Those who want progress focus on the corruptions of the right wing government and the backward thinking followers because their views are extreme and baseless. They stop looking at the corruptions from the party they support or make justifications for them in most cases. The left and right, regardless of views, both support a highly unsustainable, economy based system. An economy based system simply doesn't work. We might as well be gripping our hands tightly over broken glass at this point.

When you revere or support the left as an opposition to ""defeat"" the right through civil participation, they recieve your trust and you feel united with others. It feels empowering, right? You took the bait! Congratulations! You just partook in the first step of the divide and conquer tactic used by authoritarian governments throughout the entirety of human history! 

I withhold my vote as a protest to our flawed system. When you vote, you enable corruption by playing their game! I just don't feel like I need a bunch of old people to babysit me and make rules to protect me and others. Im a fully grown adult for fuck's sake. I want independence, not be forced into a multiple choice board game designed to entertain bored rich people while being babysat by meat-head police who care more about harmless technical board game violations than actual physical or civil threats. Only you can bring your life to prosper, not some politician."
Futurology,ffcx160,t1_ffcvde7,1579809042.0,"I dont see why people are arguing with you about this and getting so irrate. Is it really that bad to just admit that neither side cares about the people and never has? Our system is broken and reinforcing it by participating is only strengthening their power over you and our unsustainability. If you cannot see that, you are a fool in denial. Sure, the democrats may not be as outwardly bad, but I feel like there is more to them than you know. I don't know why it's so bad or ""immature"" to say both parties are working together to divide the people."
tifu,ffb147s,t1_ff86uab,1579749196.0,This is some White Knight shit if I ever read it lmfao. He said he tried to go to church with her. She simply doesn't love him. I don't feel sorry for this married couple at all. The man is hopeless and passive and the woman is an empty husk of a human. Both are to blame.
tifu,ffb04ie,t3_es489q,1579748523.0,"I don't get how you can be so aware to an issue like this, vent it in such detail, and recieve bits of advice from several people who have had these similar experiences and learned from them, only to decide to act against your own best interests and continue your failed relationship anyways, fully knowing and aware that you aren't happy. You're seeking sympathy and validation trying to get people to feel sorry for you so you can justify the idea of staying in your relationship. I don't feel sorry for you at all. You're going to ruin your kids' mental health by not divorcing her. This is coming from another child of divorce. My parents fighting each other and trying to ""fix things"" was more damaging to my sister and I than if they would've just gotten a divorce. If you really cared about your kids and your own well-being you're better off divorcing her."

todayilearned,fe6jx5r,t1_fe6do07,1578893324.0,"I have empathy and respect for life. I don't have respect for a person that actively puts themselves in protected territory to kill a protected species because said person wasn't clever enough to find a way to feed their family when others in the area probably could orrrr you and your kin were just meant to die, unfortunately. I also don't have respect for the people in the past who started and promoted this market and the big business men in China who hire the lowly poachers. Our unsustainsble practices will be our undoing, and I won't feel bad for us when we all die. We aren't using our brains clearly. This is like a tiger not using its claws or teeth to catch prey. Its an animal that will never survive.

Also, if you step into a large territorial animal's territory to fuck it up for its horn, you should know death or serious injury is most likely to happen. An animal will defend itself by taking your life. If you use your brain, you'll realize this and maybe think again. If you don't realize this, you deserve your likely death and I still don't feel sorry for you. Social justice won't be a thing when we destroy ourselves, whatever way that maybe, so fuck social justice."
todayilearned,fe6an6z,t1_fe672a1,1578885583.0,"Nihilistic because it tramples on the idea of YOUR own self importance? That's a defense mechanism. Our selfishness is what is destroying the planet and life. We are living unsustainably because we like objects and things to keep our minds busy from anxiety, boredom, and depression. It hurts the ecosystem and kills life. Poor us for having anxiety though amirite?

We can keep our technologies, knowledge, and advancements as long as we stay conscious to sustainable use (which most of us aren't) We've reached a point of beating survival already, so it's our responsibility to look after ourselves and to look out for our impact on ecosystems and other living beings, who haven't beaten survival yet and depend on their ecosystems to thrive.

If a human dies trying to poach a vulnerable species that is vulnerable because of us, then said person deserves to die and I dont feel sorry for them. Like I said, there is no inherent meaning to human life. We create our own meaning to life, there is no grand purpose for us all. Sorry that makes you defensive."

todayilearned,fe4fpxr,t1_fe458ls,1578858760.0,We aren't really important at all to anything besides ourselves. Us being important is just a delusion you feed yourself. Humans are mostly a waste of space and resources. Get over yourself!

worldnews,fdba7j7,t1_fdb6lct,1578255407.0,"Do you have the stats then? I see a lot of economic struggle around me in family, coworkers, and friends. Rent and housing costs in my state are through the roof. You're paying $200,000 or more for a shit mobile/manufactured home outside of the city. You're paying $1100 a month for a one bedroom apartment in a barely decent area. Sure, it's anecdotal evidence, but I really don't believe when you say the economy is the best it's been. That's complete bullshit."
worldnews,fdb53v5,t1_fdb2x5w,1578253933.0,These are all baseless claims and the economy shouldn't be our priority in society. An economy based system is and will always be the cause of every bout of chaos in our world.

Documentaries,fd4ouvp,t1_fd49bub,1578169531.0,"Studied and well defined by cultures who think in the same light with similar belief patterns though. That's like a bunch of delusional people cyclically justifying each others' delusions so that they can remain that way and stay unchanged. Religious belief is all a big ruse to see who can be the best liar. Having faith in yourself means having faith in your abilities to adapt and survive through most situations. Having faith in yourself means accepting and appreciating who you are and striving to be the best version of yourself for YOU. Having faith in yourself is NOT giving your power away to a self-projected imaginary being so that you can strive to be like them. That ""being"" or force that you all imagine is just what you'd like to be as a person one day. That isn't god, that is you and only you."
Documentaries,fd4me2y,t1_fd49ty5,1578168862.0,"I wasn't saying you felt fear during your ""experience"". Of course you felt those things though. A mystical experience is a subconscious response to a lack of direction and hope for yourself. Your brain plays a game with itself to where it utilizes strong feelings and symbolism to inspire you to make a change for yourself from a hopeless spot. It's your brain trying to motivate you to take action. It isn't god. It isn't some cosmic force. It isn't a unified consciousness. It isn't the universe. It isn't a grand purpose. It's you.

However, the symbolism can be taken too seriously at this point and eventually it becomes a self-fueled delusion. I fell into the mindstate you are in now. There is no grand meaning or way of life, it is just you taking this symbolism too seriously. Life is what it is. Just enjoy what brings you joy and enjoy good company."
Documentaries,fd45t4f,t1_fd3oqjs,1578164654.0,Mystical experiences are nothing but delusions brought on by fear and hopelessness.
Documentaries,fd43sbb,t1_fd3b8ra,1578164143.0,"""Mystical experiences"" are all a make-believe attempt at trying to convince the non-spiritual of your beliefs so you can convert/manipulate them into your or another's control. It's also a victory at the hands of delusion winning over your mind through heavily repeated justifications mixed with fear, and a general lack of faith in self. 

Cult leaders have ""mystical experiences"" too and they always turned out to either be delusional or a narcissist. Faith or belief in yourself is the only type of faith or belief you should ever have."
Documentaries,fd415r5,t1_fd3s031,1578163452.0,"Religion is evolving to die. Religion was a necessary evil for us to jump into starting moral development, but is no longer relevant to our situation in our social evolution. It is only something to learn and move on from now."
Documentaries,fd3ziuo,t1_fd3fl40,1578162973.0,"I don't think it's elitist to help people understand critical thinking so they can defend themselves against indoctrinated thought wnd tyranny. Why do I stand by science? I stand with science because, while it's never perfect, it has actually been present in our society and shows proof of it doing good for us and our progress. It is SEEN and there is PROOF of it. 

Religious belief on the other hand, has supressed groups in populations, treated women as second class citizens, encouraged slavery, started wars, commited genocide, and creates division amongst the people. It STILL has this effect, even today! What good has religion brought lately? What use is there for it besides relaxing you from your fear of death or your own wrong doings? All that the major religions are is a cult following from thousands of years ago and a baby blanket for those who have no faith in themselves. The only good kind of faith is a faith in yourself. Don't give your faith to anyone else."

The amount of drivers who have THC in their system has little to do with how many of them are actually intoxicated/high while driving. I don't think we should advise people to drive high, but I do think weed is different than alcohol with the fact that some can function while they are high and some cannot. I've been driving high for several years and I know my limits. For example, I can drive after few dabs or a joint, but I will not drive on edibles."

trashy,fchj8bb,t1_fcgoldr,1577650971.0,"You're putting too much of your energy in the wrong place then. Like I stated above, it isn't your level of responsibility to take on. You can only be there to listen to them vent and recommend therapy. Be receptive, but dont try to give advice. Just acknowledge how they feel and leave it there. The rest is up to them to get professional or seasoned help. Most stable minded people aren't mentally or emotionally equipped to handle someone who suffers from mental illness. You're getting dragged down because you're interferring in something that isn't in your territory or experience.  

I've learned that most people dont understand delusions, paranoia, or hallucinations. Stable minded people can't comprehend these experiences, so they get lost in trying to solve these problems. My girlfriend and mom just let me vent when I'm having trouble and stopped trying to help. The venting calms me down enough to where advice can be slowly worked in. Giving advice mid-episode is and will always end in catastrophy."
trashy,fcga49h,t1_fcfrhcl,1577638003.0,"I think people who say ""suicide is selfish"" should have to prove how selfless and righteous they are. In other words, when someone you know is depressed and suicidal, you should be the selfless one who watches after, listens to, and cares for the victim AT ALL TIMES of struggle. If you so much as give up on the person in a moment of vulnerability, they have a free pass to ""selflessly"" commit suicide. 

This issue is a two way street often leaning towards the victim. When I attempted on my own life, I did so because my loved ones shooed and pushed me away when I reached out for help because I was ""too negative and depressing"". They didn't try to understand my side and said that dealing with me was just as much suffering for them as my mental illness was for me, which is horseshit because I was hallucinating and delusional while they weren't. I took that as me being a burden to them, so I blacked out, strangled myself, and ended up in a hospital for a week and a half. 

I tried to take my own life for the selfless reason that I hurt others and didn't want to anymore. Caring for someone who has suicidal thoughts is very hard work and most aren't up for it. 

You aren't clear headed in that state of mind, so a support group and therapy are vital in preventative care. NEVER tell a suicidal person they are selfish or too much to deal with when they are vulnerable or considering suicide. It's easiest to listen to them vent and not offer advice at all. Advice for betterment or self improvement should be reserved for professionals and survivors who have conquered themselves. Regular everyday people trying to help and viral motivational speakers ARE NOT therapists or of any help. In fact, those things are extremely dangerous."
AskReddit,fbludye,t1_fblqjb4,1576970533.0,"Sanders as a person is well intented and I will give him that. However, I feel as if he will be pushed around in our current system seeing as several very powerful industries and political ""leaders"" would see his presidency as a threat to their interests and would then subtly conspire against him as they have with countless others who've tried to make a change. Sanders still believes significant changes can be made within our system and wants to hold onto what he can. I do not believe in this. I feel scrapping it and making a system based on holding everyone accountable for their action or inaction is our solution. Our system is too far gone to repair trust. If we are to progress, we must accept what is and move on. We always figure it out. Right now we're refusing to figure it out by keeping this system alive and well by meansof codependence and fear."
