You could also call yourself Chinese or mixed race but I think it’s up to you to decide how you identity yourself when you have mixed heritage. Plus America loves its “one drop rule”.

The situation had happened organically before, notably with unwed pregnant teen Claudette Colvin but they wanted a “perfect” case to present to the media. Rosa was pretty, light skinned and a poster child. It worked. 

I think of it similar to how people may set up a situation to chellenge a law, or at least wait for a good clear, unambiguous example to use as challenge. Or, on a modern note, black lives matter. I remember seeing a lot of people wish (for lack of better explaination) that the movement had latched onto Philando Castile or the guy shot in Walmart checking out the guns they had for sale- instead of Mike Brown who’d robbed a store before the “hands up don’t shoot” incident.
