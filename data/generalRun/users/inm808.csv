if i am reading correctly, that means perscription deaths and heroin deaths have different peaks. why is that relationship you pointed out noteworthy? if they were connected, wouldn't perscription peak (and subsequent fall) mirror that of heroin?

they dont actually call them. its more of a formality in your application. hundreds of thousands if not millions of people apply to those jobs every year that would be a collosal waste of time to have humans calling multiple referneces for each before their interview. even after interview tbh. theyll usually just background check to make sure your not lying about education / employment history / criminal record and call it a day
