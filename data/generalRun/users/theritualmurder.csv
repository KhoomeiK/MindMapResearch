TattooRemoval,ffnlao1,t3_eub99u,1580067512.0,"Well, estimating exactly how many sessions one needs is really difficult because everyone has different lifestyles, immune systems, etc.

Shading fades first, and then the outline comes second. So you're probably looking at 10-14 sessions. Maybe less, maybe more. 

On a different note, that tattoo looks like a very cool project. Do you not consider coloring it? If you do, be careful because it would make an eventual removal much more difficult."
