I also want to say that I know that the amount awarded for the monthly amount received by people on SSI/SSDI has surely gone up since the time I started receiving mine. I also want to say that I am really surprised there aren't millions more homeless people due to cost of living & mental illness (among other illnesses that make a person unable to work & that don't have any help with bills).

bipolar2,fgqap70,t1_fgq6eub,1581020899.0,"I live in the SW in a smallish city. I have cut way back on things I would do when I worked. Slow internet, pay as you go phone, only borrowed books, netflix in SD & super cheap pc video games (usually just 1 a year) for entertainment. 0 going out at all. Cheap food, clothes & a studio apartment. If my rent goes up, I'm going to give up internet & maybe even my phone. It's not great or fun, but it's doable. A lot of programs told me I would not qualify (medicaid, extra help with medicaid deductibles & premiums, food stamps, etc), but if you apply, you'd be surprised at what you do qualify for- I'm sure they just try to discourage anyone from trying to get the help. If you qualify as SMI (seriously mentally ill) it makes a big difference in being able to get help, but it's not something that they consider labeling lightly. 

You might want to talk to Social Security directly about how much they will do in terms of paperwork & getting paperwork done for you (could be most or even all depending on your state), or hire a disability lawyer (you don't pay upfront, they take a chunk of your settlement & they do the legwork for you as well). 

Again, I feel for you having to have this illness & cope with all you're doing & the fact that your pdoc is such an idiot about it."

bipolar2,fgq5hmc,t1_fgpyn4r,1581018236.0,"I can only relate my own experience. I had to stop working about 20 years ago (I can't remember how long, as my cognitive abilities have made my brain break). My employer kept changing my job position until they knew I literally could not work the hours they gave me. I'm sure some of those people, who can't/don't work have other people who help pay bills, I don't. I am on disability & pay all my bills. It really screws your mind up & kills yourself esteem & is very isolating when you literally cannot hold a job. I've tried volunteering to get out & they would not assign me any work as I can't remember how to keep count of things. 

I think your doctor was taking in all I said above, when considering how well you are functioning. I understand your anger at having to work in order to pay your bills. I'm guessing it's really a struggle for you to work. I""m not in any way saying you have it better than me. Just trying to give perspective on why your doctor may have said that.  You should let him/her know how that made you feel & how hard it is for you to keep working. 

You do have the option of going on disability, but it should be your last option. My total income for last year was $11.000. It's based on what you make at the time you win your case/when you last worked & what you were making. You may already be making only as much as I get, or even less, so that may be a factor in deciding as well. 

I'm sorry your doctor assumed you were in a better place just because you work."

BipolarReddit,fgn4d72,t1_fgmmgui,1580937477.0,"In my own experience, it's best to have boundaries with your support people. You don't have to share everything with them. It should be your choice, not theirs, what you share. You may need to tell them that you appreciate their concern, but that you don't feel comfortable discussing your medications or what goes on during your pdoc interactions any more & that you prefer to keep that info private, between you & your pdoc.  You might tell them that you only want support with your moods & coping & you may need to stress again that you want to keep medications & pdoc interactions private, in order for you to be comfortable."
BipolarReddit,fgn2fzt,t3_ez1gtq,1580936409.0,"> Maybe this post should be more of a complaint that there IS no community for the after. The focus is 100% on medicine and very little on the work that begins once the medicine is figured out. 

While I get that you want to complain about there being no community for Bipolar support that addresses people who are somewhat or mostly stable on medication, if you feel that this sub isn't meeting your needs, why not DM the mods here and ask for suggestions for what subs might better fit your needs rather than complaining to the community about ti?  It's not this communities responsibility to meet just your needs. 

While there are many posts on here that focus on medicine, in no way is it 100% about the medicine. The whole point, as I see it, on all of the posts about medicine are questions about what medicines work for people, side effects, what to expect, etc. Why should that be an issue? That's support for us. 

I see so many posts on how people are working here to supplement their recovery, whether their medication is working or not. Specifically on the exact things, though not always all of the same things, you advocate for.  I see people asking for suggestions as to what they can do to get better. Are those posts invisible to you? Do you ignore them because they aren't the same as what you do? I'm sure many of those posts would love your experience, as long as you do not say that meds are a cast. That implies that eventually that cast can be taken off & their illness will be healed. Yes, some of us can go med free eventually, but a large part of us can't & never will be able to. As many people here have said, one size does not fit all. What works for you will absolutely not work for all of us & your post sounds like you are trying to shame those of us that it doesn't work for, as if we just aren't working hard enough. Would you tell that to someone with another illness? Would you say that in a cancer forum? That they just aren't working hard enough to get better?"

bipolar2,fg48qay,t1_fg46v8q,1580498533.0,"Are you bipolar 2, or are you just assuming? Saying people that act out of hypo-mania when it comes to sexual behavior & giving in to hypo-mania does not make them amoral. If anyone who gives in to hypo-mania urges, whether it's spending money, cheating on your partner, or other hypo-manic actions, while it's likely they don't care, I think it's better to say that they can't control their actions. That doesn't make them amoral or a bad person. If they could control their actions, then in my opinion, that's not control of hypo-mania. Medication & therapy may help, but not everyone can make good choices & control their hypomania. In my opinion, you should not be judging people's hypo-mania, or trying to gate-keep it.

I did notice that the society consisted of rich white people, but I had no idea how diverse casting is/is not in the country it was filmed in, so it didn't really click how much Rosa stood out, other than being in a lower economic class. Rosa seemed to carry as much guilt as the others & she even ascended to an elder more quickly because of it. She seemed to have morals as low as a lot of the others, leaving her father to care for her mother & being very cold about it. Telling Fleur that she was better suited to be the intern, again, coldly. I also did not like the way she treated her friend. She never seemed to have any empathy for anyone & only cared about herself.  I didn't like her character & to me, the sacrifice she made at the end was not enough to redeem her in my eyes. 

All that said, I did like the show. I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed it more or less if I knew, going in, what the theme was going to be.

All of the members, except Rosa, who is possibly connected to a descendant of one of the slaves, talks about how they are all descendants of older family members. The fact that she is held captive & doesn't age may be her eternal punishment for taking part in the trade. Perhaps she will be able to move on once Rosa ends the society.  !<"

They did record his surgery & told me he made medical history. The size of his tumor & the fact that he had no disability after was amazing. Something about his spinal nerves being wrapped around the tumor & them having to extract each one. This was decades ago & it was a very big deal at the time. I hope it helped others."

AskReddit,fewmms7,t3_eqies2,1579414832.0,"My sister's husband was in hospice & we went to her house to rest. She took a xanax & fell asleep. The hospital called & said we should probably come back in pretty soon. I woke her up & told her we needed to go. She was so exhausted that she said she didn't think they were right & that she really wanted to go back to sleep. I told her, no, that she'd regret it & I told her he was going to die at 3:15am, which was in about half an hour. We went to the hospital. He died at 3:15am.  Disclaimer- I'm not sure that is the exact time I gave, but the time I did give was the exact time he died. 

When my mom was in hospice, we were taking turns spending the night with her. What happened with me knowing when my BIL was going to die, they jokingly asked me what night mom was going to die & said I would have to stay that night. I said, sure, it's going to be Sunday & I spent the night. Of course she died that night & of course my sisters, who shared our mom's morbid sense of humor joked about what I must've done to be sure my prophecy came true. Disclaimer: not sure what the actual day of the week it was, but I did guess the correct day, it was within the same week. 

After my mom passed away, my dad decided to start doing things he'd wanted to do, like take a cruise, that he'd been unable to do while being mom's caregiver. I dropped by his house a few weeks before the cruise. The only way I can explain what happened is that I sensed something wrong with him, but it was nothing outwardly obvious & he didn't act any differently than usual, but when I got home after the visit, I emailed all my siblings & said that dad was not going to go on the cruise & I thought something was very wrong. They all laughed it off. His health suddenly went downhill. He never did get to take that cruise. He died a month or so later, in the same hospice room our mom died in. I do believe he died of a broken heart. 

I've had a connection with death since a close friend died when I was 15. After that, my best friend I had when I was 16 died. I've seen things that would make me think of someone I used to know & find out they'd died that day. I don't see ghosts, I'm not sure I believe in ghosts, especially as mom always promised to come back & scare me after she died. My mom used to read the obituaries every morning & though we never discussed it, I wonder if she'd had similar experiences. She had a wicked & morbid sense of humor. I'm still hoping she'll scare me some day or night."
