Edited to add: every cat I've ever had has enjoyed napping on the floor as much as high places."

AskReddit,fcwcz7r,t3_egmc07,1578022543.0,"I (22f) know I'm late to this post, but thought I would give my two cents, especially since I saw you're getting them out soon. I got mine out 12/17, was mostly recovered and feeling generally well by 12/28 when I had a hemorrhage. I had to stay in the hospital overnight and then get it recauterized 12/29. Pain was pretty bad days 3-8, and then again for the four days I've had since the recauterization. 
Here are my tips:
- Use a humidifier. If your air is dry you will have a lot more discomfort in your throat.
- Take pain medication as directed. Don't skip any until your scabs are out, even if your are feeling well. They say your scabs will fall out around Day 7. On Day 6, I was feeling well and switched to ibuprofen every 4 hours instead of Hydrocodone every 6. I woke up in the middle of the night with a scab falling out and was in a hell of pain. After the recauterization I was able to take just Acetaminophen.
- Drink regularly. I was able to sleep for 4-6 hours at a time but frequently woke up with my throat feeling very dry and uncomfortable. I would recommend drinking a lot before sleep if you're going to sleep that long. 
- Don't worry too much about ""staying nourished"" unless you have other health concerns. I hardly ate anything between days 1 and 4 because it hurt so badly to swallow. The pain medicines also made me nauseated and gave me a small appetite. I ate about 1 popsicle, a quarter cup of applesauce and a half cup of sherbet in a whole day. I didn't have any significant problems with malnourishment or weight loss (I did lose about 7 lbs between the initial surgery and when I went into the hospital for recauterization)
- Get a laxative of some sort. I was constipated for about a week and a half after surgery. Pooping was painful and I would get very small amounts of waste out. I wished I had started a laxative sooner to keep me more regular, but a lot of the problem was just that there was a lack of food being digested. 
- If possible, have the person who will be the primary care giver during recovery be your ride to/from the hospital. This reduces the amount of information transfer and helps them to ask any questions of the nurses/surgeons.
- Be prepared with a puke bucket handy. I vomited twice during my initial recovery period, once on day 1 and once on day 7. On Day 7, a large piece of scab coming off caused me to gag and vomit. You don't want to have to run to the bathroom to not make a mess... I was hardly up for walking around the house until Day 3. I ended up with a virus or something after the recauterization and vomited a lot then - have something ready to vomit in. 
- Personally anything creamy was a no-go. My saliva was thick and hard to swallow and anything creamy just worsened that. So mashed potatoes, milk, milkshakes, ice cream, cottage cheese - all out of the question. I did find that potatoes cooked in broth with extra broth over it were delicious and satisfying around Days 6 and 7 (my family had a roast and I had the potatoes from it). By Day 9, most of the scabs were out and I could eat basically anything that wasn't crispy or spicy. 
- Have antacids available... Most of the food/drink I could take was relatively acidic... I already have problems with acid reflux, and the food/drink I had enhanced that."
tonsilstones,fck1arg,t1_fcjob1h,1577713512.0,"They prescribed hydrocodone which is what I had after the initial procedure. I'm trying not to take it, because it made me nauseated and dizzy before. So I'm alternating between acetaminophen and ibuprofen. The pain honestly isn't terrible and I was able to sleep most of the night."
tonsilstones,fcjo2fp,t1_fcjlh1q,1577696047.0,"I ended up with bleeding that wouldn't clot up. Had to go to ER, spent a night in the hospital and having surgery to re-cauterize the wound. That was yesterday.  I feel like I'm back on day 2/3 of recovery... I also swallowed enough blood to wreak havoc on my digestive system."

tonsilstones,fc9uuru,t3_efrnki,1577558555.0,"I'm on day 11 post-op. Also 22 y/o. My pain was not bad post day 8. Day 7 I had a scab loosen that literally made me vomit because it triggered my gag reflex. By day 8, basically all the scabs on the left side were gone (just a small layer). Even now on Day 11 I still have pretty extensive scabs on the right side (my tonsil on the right side had been very swollen and inflamed, so I'm thinking that might be why). By Day 6, I was eating soft foods (potatoes, lasagna, bread, etc.) My doctor recommended chewing gum and Sucrets throat lozenges during recovery. I have found gargling with either salt water or diluted mouthwash to help loosen the scabs, but be careful... Today was gargling and ended up with a fair amount of bleeding."
