college,fdlucid,t1_fdlu45i,1578532689.0,"Good point but it's worth mentioning that at least some states require an updated hazing record/compliance records. It's worth looking into if OP is in those states. Otherwise, some Greek Life offices publish a guide every semester w/ chapter GPA and other important statistics that may be important to look into."
college,fdkav3v,t3_elsjmf,1578499975.0,"Greek life is a mixed bag and it really depends on the environment and individual chapters. I would look to see if your university has any hazing or misconduct records listings so you can potentially screen out some of the less friendly chapters. Fraternity rush is much different than sorority rush. In my experience, fraternity rush was much less official, generally more chill, and while I had to of course spend time going to the rush events, I did not have to move in early and spend ten days (for the entire day) going through recruitment like those interested in the sororities. I ultimately pledged and initiated but I dropped at the end of my sophomore year because the small benefits weren't worth the cost and time.

My general advice for those interested in fraternity recruitment is this: if you are even only half-interested, go through the formal recruitment process anyway. You don't have to commit to anything and you get some free stuff at least. It also is designed to help you study the chapters more in depth and, if you're on the fence, potentially find a chapter convincing enough to make you pledge. You can also drop from a fraternity pretty much at any time if it doesn't align with what you envisioned (though you cannot join a different chapter if you've already been formally initiated into one, even after dropping)."
college,fdk9rcx,t3_eltgxx,1578499278.0,"I know my university, and I would assume most others, allowed you to take a leave of absence wherein you do not have to register for classes but do not have to re-apply to the university (you maintain enrollment but don't pay at least most of the fees).  As others have said, I would say suspending your college education while sorting out your mental health, obtaining a new therapist, and finding a treatment regimen that has manageable side effects is the best course for you. To be very honest, if there was difficulty with just the academic/mental health aspects and if you have not made significant changes or progress in the reasons you had trouble, it is unlikely that piling financial, further mental, and family issues on top will make it much easier. Again, this does not necessarily mean dropping out.

Your post mentions that you have two years of schooling left. Does this mean you've completed the gen ed requirements for your program of study? If not, I would suggest taking and transferring those credits at a community college. That will alleviate some financial burden and if you are able to focus and succeed in those courses, you'll hopefully build a case to continue at your university or, at the very least, the personal confidence to return and succeed.

Lastly, please know that every year, there are other people who find themselves in the same or similar situation as you. You're not alone. While this is an obstacle you must overcome, it is not insurmountable, and taking a break will not preclude you from becoming a music teacher. After all, if you're a school board looking to hire a teacher, one that took a break and came back and excelled would look a lot better than someone who barely made it through, at least in my opinion. Best of luck to you!"
HistoryPorn,fdgm59b,t1_fdfn8ws,1578401955.0,"Trump was given college deferments in 1964-68 and medically disqualified except in national emergency after graduating. Therefore he would not have been selected at all. Its important to note that receiving a medical exemption does not necessarily mean you were actually selected and had to get the deferment after the fact. You could be disqualified and excluded from draft board consideration when they issued orders of induction. 

Also, people born maybe the same year/slightly older than Trump hit a statistical “sweet spot” (relative to other years). This televised lottery process with the tumbler and capsules was actually a new process of drafting altogether compared to drafts for 1942-1969. There was not a similar 1968 lottery for instance. With the change, the draft boards also changed their preferred draftee age to 20, whereas prior to 1970, they would draft the older men first. Therefore, men who were roughly 20 in 1965/1966 would be turning 24-25 1970 and thus remained on a lower priority to draft than men who turned 25 in 1968 or 20 in 1970. So there is a good chance that Trump would not have been selected in either system, but still enough of one to warrant obtaining the deferments he received."
atheism,fcfti6m,t1_fcbzkra,1577633597.0,"Late to the party here but I am really interested in some of what you said here, and I am concerned as an atheist myself that you may be too uncomfortable truly expressing your religion and discussing religion in general with your boyfriend.

> if I go anymore in depth... you will think I’m crazy

Why do you think we will think you’re crazy? I don’t think the vast majority of people would say that you would be crazy, but instead that you aren’t considering your own experiences as subjective and filled with your own interpretation rather than objective. Do you think possibly that perhaps your concern over our perception could stem from a larger disconnect between you and an atheist in regards to determining the criteria to judge whether or not a religion is real? That is a pretty fundamental difference.

> I don’t know how to explain the wonders of faith

That is perfectly fine and I know that at least I myself have feelings, intuitions, and opinions that I have to take some time to really explain correctly. However, as others have (and potentially your boyfriend might) say is that, for them, it is hard to reconcile the fact that followers of most major religions in the world, despite the faiths themselves being largely incompatible with each other, have similar self-confirming experiences across the board. Do you think, without presupposing that Christianity is true, that a Christian’s experience of wonders has more weight, value, or substance to it than a Muslim or Hindu? What would you say to someone in a different religion who’s asked the same thing but about their experiences as a Muslim being “truer” than that of a Christian’s? This is a major issue you have to be prepared to at least consider if you’re talking about religious ideology with an atheist.

>  I’m just trying to not make people mad...

The vast majority of atheists and agnostics would not get mad at someone for sharing their experiences because quite a few are former believers and understand where you’d be coming from. I think a lot of nonbelievers would again have an issue with assuming a subjective personal experience is the end-all, be-all evidence needed to believe what is proposed as an objective truth about our existence. But that doesn’t mean they’re mad at you. Some people feel very strongly when a believer doesn’t budge in their beliefs, which I don’t really agree with, but again it comes down to the question of “what are the boxes that need to be checked in order to believe in a religion?”

> If I said I have felt god’s presence... I’ll just get ridiculed

Again, many current nonbelievers are former believers and understand where you’re coming from. They also come from the experience of having such a powerful “connection” and then realizing that logically their beliefs don’t really make sense. I think most atheists in general just ask that you consider what they’re saying and try to apply it to your faith instead of the most common response which is usually “well i have an indescribable personal experience/story that convinces me and there’s no way that I would ever leave my religion.” To many, that comes across as close-mindedness and also defeats the purpose of talking and questioning faith at all, which is something you should be doing regardless, as to many it helps them *build* their faith and better understand their relationship with it.

> I’m just trying to be more logical because I know that’s how you tend to think

So yeah as I said earlier, often the disconnect between believers and nonbelievers is really a disconnect in what exactly would justify a potential religious belief. And so it sounds like your faith is not based in logic but in personal experience (which is very common and I’m not trying to be accusatory). That being said, my perspective is that there are things in this universe that are fundamentally true. xyz=xyz, if a=b and b=c then a=c, if I stand on the surface of the earth and toss a ball in the air slower than escape velocity, it will come back down. So on and so forth. Beyond those fundamental principles, which are arrived at through both observation AND logic, our experience is entirely subjective and based on our own biases and feelings. Therefore, if we wanted to claim some new objective truth, like 2+2=4, or that 2+2 actually equals 5, or that a particular god exists, we have to rely on logical reasoning and critical thinking to get there. Just because I feel that 2+2=5 is true in my heart and that such an equation directly effects my life, does not mean it is actually true. That is a silly example but one I hope you can understand and use to see where many of us, possibly including your boyfriend, are coming from.

I know you are very reserved about talking about your personal faith and experiences out in the open on here, especially since you’ve been confronted with some harsh (but i will emphasize, not entirely untrue) words about indoctrination and whatnot. However it is important to talk about and share those experiences so that if you are going to believe, you can do so with conviction or, if you’re on the fence about what your experiences mean, explore them further. Hope I’ve come across as fair. I used to be religious myself so if you would like to share your experiences or talk about my post, feel free to shoot me a pm."
college,euiwmcp,t3_cgnaey,1563856911.0,"It sounds like you are a creative that enjoys bringing to life both your ideas and ideas of others. You have a natural curiosity and would probably describe yourself as a life-long learner. You also have an interest in entomology and, it sounds like, biology in general, but maybe focusing more on environmental science and zoology. Without regard to what you would be comfortable with in pay/standard of living, I would suggest exploring careers in education (maybe science education), or digital art/writing.

&#x200B;

The best case scenario for you would be to take a semester to take some classes in the subjects and interests you listed above and see what program you would like the most, though you would have to catch up even quicker than if you switched now.  The medium case scenario, as much as I hate to suggest it, is that you've completed enough of your CE program that you can complete the course in the next two semesters and use your final year to take electives/minor. The worst case scenario is that the first two cases are not possible and you must switch and you must do so in the near future. If that is the case, choose a program that will be flexible enough to have long-term employability prospects. Look potentially at business, public relations, communications, graphic design, etc. that all probably have more flexibility and use than, say, film production (my major!). 

&#x200B;

Your major does not define you and does not totally define your career. I know someone with a BS in Experimental Psych doing international business consulting, a fellow film major who is a marketing associate, and a Biochem student that does technical writing. At the same time, it is a job. While you should love your job and find it rewarding, it's also something that will probably be a drag sometimes and something that you'll probably have to wake up every morning to go do, even when you don't want to. Don't spend forever looking for the one unicorn major or career path."
