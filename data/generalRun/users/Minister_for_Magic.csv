venturecapital,ff4xdst,t3_erahz1,1579574730.0,"Some good answers here so far, but I'll add a couple of other points that haven't been mentioned:

**For Founders**

Pros

* can be issued quickly - *usually* less time from signing docs to money in the bank
* can allow for multiple closings (so all investors don't have to be corralled at once)
* *can* be cheaper, though Seed Equity docs have become very standard and cost much less than they once did. This isn't a big pro anymore.

Cons

* the interest can add up to meaningful additional dilution 
* they have maturity dates that can force conversion or be called due (though this rarely happens in practice)
* alternatives, like YCs SAFE, have evolved to be *incredibly* founder unfriendly. The new SAFE is a post-money safe, meaning all dilution from future raises before conversion and the issuance of an option pool are borne by the founders alone while the SAFE investors are protected.

**For Investors**

Pros

* less of their money spent on legal fees
* don't have to commit to a high valuation up front. The startup has to prove they are worth the cap.
* get a discount on next round price (usually 15-20%) that is usually pretty favorable for them

Cons

* future investors may cram them down (renegotiate note) if they think the terms are too generous to early investors or set too high a price for next round
* make conversion math more complex = more expensive legal fees for round of conversion
* often come with fewer oversight rights (board seats, etc.) that have to be negotiated in next priced round."
