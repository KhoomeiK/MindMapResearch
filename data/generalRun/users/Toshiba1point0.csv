movies,ff4bd15,t3_erg0ey,1579559647.0,"Since the concept of super powers is completely fictional, popularized,  and generally accepted its not all that important as long as they are consistent and properly scripted with the characters involved. 

An example from the early 80s is The Greatest American Hero which basically relied on the premise that aliens left a suit with no instructions. You start asking questions like why does it fit, how did they get here, and why do they care...you're going to have problems."
Lyft,ff494w6,t3_erik4b,1579558245.0,"No good deed goes unpunished. I wouldn't recommend it and no matter what the resentment over being terminated will still linger. Youve already done more than enough keeping him employed.  Your best bet is a documented list of infractions,  severance pay  and an escort outside the premises. Its not your problem anymore so dont continue to make it one."

movies,ff3getv,t3_eqz0f1,1579540505.0,"No sound errors really surprise me anymore after learning that every word of dialogue is read through in the studio and used in place of what is spoken in scenes. Everyday life is pretty quiet and dull so on the screen, someone drinking, eating, walking around is going to seem eerie without some noise."
movies,ff38f21,t3_er4tkf,1579536136.0,"There's a thousand of them in the Godfather but the one that got me was how Michael Corleone's eyes changed to resemble his father's which if you remember were shadowed, made to look like ""windows to the soul""

My other favorite is when Michael is speaking to Carlos after the baptism scene and the shadow from his hat covers half his face. 

The isolation represented by a frame around a window or door when has to make a decision to kill is also brilliant."
