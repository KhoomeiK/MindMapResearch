We have had cats for years and their illnesses are hard to cope with.  Our vet says that animals, especially felines, hide their weakness/illness.  For an ill cat, peace and quiet knowing they are safe is needed (e.g. don’t run the vacuum cleaner in front of them)."

As the caretaker, you suppress and compartmentize all of your feelings to get through the moment, the hour, the day.  You feel the need to stay “strong”. 

If it a loved one, the caretaker is under tremendous emotional and physical stress.  Having a support network (family and friends) can help with the burden.  You need a break, even if it’s just to run the the pharmacy.

As strange as it sounds, anger and resentment are very normal under these circumstances.  Recognize them as an outcome of feeling helpless and stress.

funny,fflq486,t1_ffkxbxs,1580042691.0,"I think I know what you are trying to say.  In our small town less than 15 years ago the police use to drive in blue and white cars, their uniforms had navy slacks and a blue shirt, and they would wave and smile at people.  

Now they drive black SUVs with deeply tinted windows, their uniforms are black and they wear body amour, and they never smile behind their dark sunglasses.  

The change from highly visible and friendly to dark and sinister has not helped with their reputation, which has diminished in our sleepy little town.  Just last fall a local road was blocked for emergency maintenance and we politely asked the police officer directing traffic if there was a detour.  Even though we were the only vehicle on the road he ignored us and when we asked again he said “Do I look like a map to you?”  without even looking at us.  Sadly this is typical.

What has changed?  Our town crime stats are lower than 15 yrs ago.  The police department is well funded (all those nice new SUVs), no police officer has been killed or wounded in all that time.  Instead of feeling “protected and served”  we’ve moved into “wary and under surveillance”
