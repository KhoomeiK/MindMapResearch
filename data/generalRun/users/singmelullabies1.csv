AmItheAsshole,ffg5x4a,t1_ffedcrn,1579899145.0,"That because she WAS taking advantage!  And now you know in the future to avoid telling her in advance that you are buying.  Or just buy breakfast foods before you get to her place so there is no need to go out to a restaurant -- you just tell her ""hey, I've brought breakfast for tomorrow.  These pastries look so good I can't wait.""  Unless she is a total douche she will be grateful for the breakfast and you avoid another $36 mooch."
AmItheAsshole,ffg28s3,t3_eszvls,1579896884.0,"YTA.  You didn't make your cousin a ""low effort"" meal, you just offered her a larger portion of what you were already making for everyone else.  You, at the least, should have made her a pasta dish or grilled veggies.  And no dressing for the salad?  Huge YTA."
AmItheAsshole,fffqr5d,t3_et8zc8,1579889759.0,NAH and I am probably going to go against the grain but talk with your sister about no longer bringing your mom any meals in her bedroom.  This would force her to at least come out of her room a few times a day.  Just breaking out of the routine of being catered to for a full year is needed.

There is no reason for you to have any continued relationship with former husband's family.  Move on with your life, move away from these people.  I would actually have called this NAH except for people pressuring you to remain tied to this family is actually weird to me so I wanted to call out that OP doing this isn't wrong in any way."
AmItheAsshole,ffahqes,t3_es8l1r,1579736012.0,"NTA.  Married couples always both get invited, one simply does not invite 1/2 of a married couple.  Jane could have cut someone else or coughed up the cost of one more meal.  The fact that Jane chose not to attend your wedding is not a good enough reason to not invite your wife.  Good for you for standing up for your wife and your marriage.  Go on the trip anyway, plan some fun stuff to do, and ignore Derek.  I have a pretty strong feeling that Derek's marriage won't last long with a controlling ass of a wife.  I think Derek is TA and so is his wife."

I have a huge problem with this type of cancellation notice/fee and here's why:  my dentist office (whom I love!) also has this cancellation fee (24 hours) and they twice cancelled MY appointment with less than 24 hours notice and I didn't get any refund.  Why should I have to pay a fee if I cancel but they don't have to pay a fee if they cancel?  If I am ever in a situation where I have to cancel and they charge me, I would be an ex-patient."

Your ""friend"" (and seriously you should rethink whether you want to continue to have any kind of relationship with this person) is literally asking people to just give her money to fund a vacation.  This has nothing to do with her wedding because this wouldn't be a wedding gift because she didn't invite these people to her wedding/reception.  She is just asking for money.

JustNoSO,ff7nh0x,t3_erwbbe,1579653763.0,Right of first refusal.  Insist on this.  Talk to your lawyer but it means that he can't drop kids at his parents house and leave.  He has to be with the kids all the time and if he can't do that then he has to offer you the first opportunity to take the kids.
JUSTNOMIL,ff7mh1q,t3_erza38,1579653073.0,"OP and DH, I am so sorry for your loss.  Please ask the hospital about services they can provide to help you through this awful time.  Suggest to DH that it might be best, just until you both get through this and come to a point where you can start thinking about the future that you now have, that perhaps it would be best to block Pandora since she has proven she doesn't have OP or DH's best interests at heart.  Let her birthday pass without comment.

I wish for you, OP and DH, that you remember the joy you felt when you discovered you two were pregnant, the hope, the dreams, the love you had for each other, and know that none of that is actually gone.  Your loss is terrible but you will get through this.  You will move through this pain, you will come out the other side together, and you will continue together.  You two are a team.

JUSTNOMIL,ff6zkqn,t3_eru6ve,1579638133.0,"I think even twice a week is too many visits.  Hell, SO is wanting his mom to visit the equivalent of every other day!  The problem, OP, as I read it (from his responses in AITA) is that he will never really enforce a limit on his mommy.  That he actually wrote ""I want GF and mom to become friends"" made me barf.  You are trying to reasonably limit his mommy visiting and he is trying to force you to have emotions you don't have.  I know you don't want to give up but are you prepared to have this argument, ad naseum, for the rest of MIL's life?  Because you will.  He will never put you or your LO as his #1 priority.  I'm sorry but do not move in with him.  Not until he can say, on his own, ""One visit per week is the limit, Mom, and it must be arranged in advance with both my and OP's agreement.""  I highly doubt therapy will help.  He is a mommy's boy through and through."

AmItheAsshole,ff6peh5,t1_ff6d10q,1579632110.0,Can you apply to the council to make it bigger?  I would think that because there is now a fence on the property the council would be more likely to approve the taller fence.
AmItheAsshole,ff6ot19,t1_ff6c2gr,1579631753.0,"Sure you can.  Just put the camera on your side of the fence, down on or near the ground at the back of your garden.  You can just mount it right to the fence, depending on the camera.  Have it point straight down the length of the fence.  That way if their kids climb over you will only be capturing them once they are on your side of the property."
AmItheAsshole,ff6mj0a,t3_erskit,1579630376.0,"NTA.  He wasn't concerned with the noise you would be making putting up the fence.  He wanted access to your back garden for his kids.

AmItheAsshole,ff5pow2,t3_eri81o,1579605037.0,"NAH.  The bride does NOT get to dictate what her guests wear outside of a general dress code (formal, or casual, or ""no jeans"", etc) and ""No white dresses"".  You are not part of the bridal party so, again, bride does not get to dictate what her guests wear.  MOH may have been trying to ""do the right thing"" but she is overstepping because, for the third time, no one can dictate what the guests wear.  Wear the dress, add a shawl or cardigan (which you don't have to keep on the whole reception), and you are good to go."
AmItheAsshole,ff4dkk9,t3_er6xyl,1579561081.0,YTA and why in the world would you put a security camera in the bedroom?  Did you also put one in the bathroom?  And you telling him to calm down is infantalizing and insulting at the same time.  He had every right to be angry and to feel violated.  You laughing at him shows how much of an ass you really are.

AmItheAsshole,ff0sjo3,t3_eqwol3,1579471895.0,"NTA.  You stopped inviting him because of his behavior and attitude, not because of his diet.  Let Tony tell anyone whatever he wants -- your group of friends know the truth so you need to not care what anyone else thinks.  That sandwich thing is crazy -- just because you eat carbs doesn't mean that is ALL that you want to eat.  And for him to have literally picked through all the sandwiches to remove the filling is beyond gross, and talk about an entitled asshole who thinks because he CHOOOSES to not eat carbs that he deserves to have ALL THE MEAT.  Keep on meeting without him.  Let him find a new group of friends that are eat keto -- he'll fit in better there."

JUSTNOMIL,fesju35,t3_eqhudg,1579365958.0,"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry but you need to RUN FOR YOUR LIFE literally.  This man has proven he will give his mother anything she wants, she will take everything from him, and that includes any and all of YOUR MONEY too.  It sucks having to end a relationship but you will never be more important than his mommy and that is not a relationship, that is just being roommates or worse friends with benefits.  He will never consider you as his #1 priority because his mommy will always be his number one priority.

Please, just end it now before wasting any more of your life on someone who just doesn't care enough about you."
AmItheAsshole,fertgtc,t3_eqfixn,1579358217.0,"NTA.  Your last statement really caught me.  She doesn't have friends because she drives them all away, just like she's doing to you now.  You are more than just what you eat and if Rose isn't willing to look at another person for all their attributes, and will only discuss diet and veganism, then that is on her, not you, and you can choose to have a broader view of life.

AmItheAsshole,fer60yr,t3_eq936n,1579350304.0,"YTA but I think you already know that since it is very apparent you did this just to stick it to your brother and SIL.

AmItheAsshole,feoanh7,t3_eq0u3t,1579297400.0,"NTA and I say this very specifically because wow your GF is sooooo in the wrong here.  Snoops is a sentimental childhood memory for you, he is causing no harm, he's taking up maybe 12 square inches, it just shouldn't be an issue.  And yet she has made it enough of an issue that you felt you needed to post here to get validation that you aren't an ass for wanting to keep Snoops where you can see him.  I want to repeat that.  She's made it such an issue you felt pushed to see if you are an ass for wanting to keep Snoops out on a bedroom table.  Seriously, dude, you need to have a long, hard, conversation, first with yourself, and then with her, about her need for control and her unreasonable request.  It starts with Snoops but I can almost guarantee that would not be the end of her demands."
JUSTNOMIL,fenx0t6,t3_eq3vc1,1579292120.0,"Get on Amazon right away and look for locking door knobs.  Replace the knobs on all the bedrooms (you have time to do this before the end of the month).  Then put everything you don't want them to snoop through in your bedroom.  Then, when they ask about the locked doors (because they will have tried to open the door) you look them in the eye, take a beat, and say ""how in the world do you know the door is locked unless you tried to enter it?  Why would you have any need to enter any of our bedrooms?  I think you just answered your own question."""

AmItheAsshole,fenno1i,t3_eq1gmd,1579288314.0,"NAH.  A wedding can be expensive but a marriage can be done at the courthouse so please don't use those terms interchangeably.  Your GF wants to wear a pretty dress which she can do regardless of where you two get married.  So you need to really look at whether you are against a wedding or against marriage.  And you two need to have another conversation because you may not find marriage to be important but it sounds like it's pretty damn important to GF.  And there is no compromise here -- either you two get married or you don't.  If you really love her and want to spend the rest of your life with her, then you need to ask yourself why you don't want to marry her (it isn't the money since there are many ways to get married that aren't expensive so using that as a reason is your own red herring)."

It doesn't matter why you went to the boss, the fact is that your co-worker isn't doing the job she is being paid to do and that isn't fair to you.  It doesn't matter why she isn't doing her job, only that she isn't doing it and leaving it to you.

Tell her you hope her wedding is all she imagines it will be, but you simply can't afford to be a bridesmaid anymore.  When (not if) she tells you that you are being unfair/not a good friend/terrible person, you simply say ""I was so excited to be part of your wedding but I will not put myself in debt to attend your wedding.""  If she is actually a good friend she will understand.  If she is having a bridezilla moment she will bitch and then realize what an ass she is and will reach out to you.

He needs counseling but you say that he is happy having her treat him like a 5 year old so that may not work.  Have you tried talking to him about why he likes being treated like a 5 year old?  There is a huge difference between being ""treated"" or ""pampered"" once in a while and being infantalized by his mommy.  You don't say how often you see ILs but I suggest cutting WAAAAY back on those visits.  And MIL needs consequences when she boundary-stomps.

Ex bailed on you and your daughter, allowed his parental rights to be terminated (i.e. he didn't do anything to try to keep those rights), and now he is in a place in his life that he wants a relationship with her.  But that ship sailed 8 years ago, and it sounds like that was the right decision for you and LO.  It would be incredibly confusing and probably detrimental to her to bring him into the picture now.  Get her into therapy so she can deal with her emotions and questions about her birth father, adoption father, and you.  When her therapist thinks she could handle a discussion around seeing the Ex, then you have a discussion with her (and probably the therapist) about what she wants.  You are putting your daughter's needs above everything else, which is what you are supposed to do.

JUSTNOMIL,fcs8g6n,t3_eilm5y,1577912914.0,"Oh, I do love DH's blindlngly bright shiny spine.  I hope the two of you put MIL in a very long timeout.  No responding to texts/emails, no answering phone calls, nothing.  If/when she apologizes, don't respond unless it's a full, [6-step apology](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sorry-heres-how-to-apologize-according-to-science/).  If it is a real apology, then you and DH can decide how you want to move forward because you've said she's apologized in the past but for her to say these awful things again about wanting you two to divorce then her apologies aren't actually real because if they were she would not have said it again.  Either way, you can support DH and also cut MIL out of your life.  Support him if he wants contact with her but you should refuse to ever see her again."
JUSTNOMIL,fcrzlvi,t3_eijjvt,1577909015.0,"OP, make sure you always are working on Christmas Eve (per her text that is when dinner will happen going forward) and other holidays but you don't tell her in advance.  If DH wants to visit he can but you just stop going to any family event that she hosts.  And here is where is gets crucial:  DH needs to note how many vegetarian options she makes for each meal.  If she doesn't know for sure that you will be attending, then she should be making enough food that you can partake.  If she doesn't then you know she did this on purpose, and you've been 1000% validated in her intentions."
AmItheAsshole,fcryexa,t3_eij99q,1577908338.0,"NTA at all.  Your sister sounds like an entitled brat.  If I were you, I would eat all the cupcakes and leave her a few of the other pastries."
AmItheAsshole,fcrsgee,t3_eiju9p,1577906014.0,NTA and please don't let your mom guilt you into paying a penny.  You hit the nail on the head when you say that they only told you about the party because they want you to send money.  They know you won't be able to attend so they are absolutely TAs.
AmItheAsshole,fcrbpvv,t3_eiiqzq,1577899657.0,NTA but you need to have a serious conversation with your wife about why she doesn't want to spend time alone with you.  Seriously.  This would worry the crap out of me.
aww,fcrba3z,t1_fcq3ek9,1577899463.0,Happy New Years /u/SchnoodleDoodleDo!  Love your poems.
AmItheAsshole,fcrasg5,t3_eiawtt,1577899259.0,"NTA NTA NTA and thank you for being so good hearted that you blew off a party to stay with Zod and help him get through a very noisy night.  Your ILs are selfish pricks who can't see that you did the very right thing.  Frankly, it saddens me a bit that your wife and son didn't also stay to help Zod feel loved and cared for but I can also guess that if they had none of you would have heard the end of the ILs whining.  ILs are TA here.  BTW - dog tax pics are required!"
AmItheAsshole,fcr9luy,t3_eiiiib,1577898767.0,NTA.  What kind of person plans a party for themselves and then asks the people they invite to pay to attend?  That alone is reason enough that OP is NTA.
AmItheAsshole,fcr4h6j,t3_eihcs9,1577896656.0,"NTA and you were right not to tell him about the money.  You need to seriously think about talking to an attorney to ensure equal financial obligation towards your child since BF is already pressuring you to allow him not to work and he obviously wants to sponge off you.  Just because you have savings doesn't mean you should fund his *wanted* lifestyle.  If you get married, you **need a prenup** to protect your savings.  You have no obligation to share with him, only an obligation to provide for your child, and he also has an obligation to provide for your child."
JUSTNOMIL,fcpcutz,t3_eid0sy,1577858646.0,"Boy oh boy.  I wrote out a whole, long, comment, and then deleted it.  Here's the problem as I see it:  your mom abandonded you, she had/has mental issues which you realize, she came back into your life and is more stable, and you had a child and she wants to be part of that life.  You say she demands time with your child which you can easily (?) deny her, but what really struck me is that you say she is saying ""grandma this and grandma that"" and you are hearing in your head that she never say ""mom this and mom that"".  I feel for you, I actually can't imagine how hard that must be to hear these caring words from someone who never said them to you.  But I ask you to ask yourself -- is she bringing goodness or benefit to your child?  You don't owe her anything, that is true.  But if she is bringing happiness and love to your son, and he is benefiting from that relationship....  Could you ask your partner to facilitate the video calls so you don't have to hear her talking with son?  I am so sorry you had such a rough childhood, and I get that you are angry with her.  I don't think you should just have to give in to her wants.  Your feelings are valid."
AmItheAsshole,fcpc0n8,t3_ei8z50,1577857727.0,"NTA.  If your roommate thinks so little of his kids that he doesn't need dedicated child care then I feel really sorry for his kids and I would recommend that you try to find a way to contact the child's other parent and let them know their child is being treated very poorly.  You have no obligation to watch his child, even if all you were going to do all day was watch TV and eat ice cream.  NTA!"
AmItheAsshole,fcpbcri,t3_ei5z0r,1577857040.0,"NTA.  A compassionate and kind person realizes that you don't just get rid of an animal/pet, you need time to rehome them if that is what you want to do, but you made a commitment to them for the rest of their lives to do best for them, so NO, you do not get ""rid"" of your dog.  If she is allergic that truly is bad for her but it should never be at the expense of your dog.  But is it possible that you could separate the living space into two general areas so your tenant can have her bedroom, kitchen, and a bit of living space, and your dog can have some roaming room outside of those areas?  It would just be for three months, and you would still be taking the dog outside for walks/playtime.  I know that seems like a long time but really, it's just for three months and in the scheme of things that is not that long."
AmItheAsshole,fcp9obn,t3_ei7ng0,1577855314.0,"NAH.  You and she are incompatible.  You require your partner to be ontime, she does not consider timeliness to be an important factor.  What anyone else thinks really isn't important.  This is what you find important in a relationship/person and no one else's input really matters."

AmItheAsshole,fco8nml,t3_ei0jrq,1577826233.0,"ESH.  You suck because you seem to care more about the ascetic of your pictures than your sister's wellbeing.  But she sucks SOOOOO much more for purposely scheduling the surgery one week before your wedding.  Unless you only gave her two months notice of your planned date, she could have picked a date far enough before your wedding or after it happened.  You might want to ask her why she wants to be in a sling for the pictures because she sure as hell scheduled this on purpose."
AmItheAsshole,fcnotik,t3_ei1cgy,1577815590.0,"NTA and only the people insisting you change are AH (so not DH).  As soon as I read that you had a child with late husband my first thought was ""of course she's going to keep it so OS won't be the only one with that name"".  Unless DH adopts him he shouldn't change his name.  But I do thinks the grandparents of OS (if they are reasonable people) would understand name change if DH adopts.  It doesn't change their relationship with OS.  I think it's good you keep that relationship going."
AmItheAsshole,fcnds7t,t3_ei3eco,1577809588.0,"NTA and I'm sorry you have such shitty friends.  Get on Meetup, find some groups that share some of your interests, and start meeting new friends.  NYE seems like the perfect time to cut toxic friends out of your life, and NY seems like the perfect time to start meeting friends that bring value to your life."
AmItheAsshole,fcnb3wj,t3_ehz9cs,1577807811.0,"NTA.  She was badgering you to do a ""favor"" for her, which you politely declined because it wasn't something you could actually do.  Then you offer a very reasonable alternative (watch you make it) and she still is badgering you to do the original favor.  Then she grudgingly accepts your alternative?  Oh, hell, no.  BTW, I also don't use measuring cups when I'm cooking (I do when baking but cooking is always winging it) and I couldn't write down a recipe.  I've tried and given it to someone else and they complained that they followed the recipe but it didn't turn out like mine and I explained (again) that ""no shit, I told you I don't use a recipe, it's all just based off my experience of making the dish, this is the best I can do for writing it down"" and they got a little pissy with me but they said they understood."
JustNoSO,fcn8o24,t3_ehzokl,1577806124.0,"I am so sorry you went through that awfulness with exSO and you need a new bestie if they think that this is in any way your fault.  I don't care if you screamed at exSO ""Hit me!  I dare you to hit me!"" it would still be totally on him if he actually lays a finger on you.  Words are never a reason for violence.  Please make sure SO is an EX!"
