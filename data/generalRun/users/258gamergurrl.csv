latterdaysaints,fd41tzk,t3_ejyugw,1578163565.0,"Hi! I have answered it truthfully as that ""aside from the obvious no drinking or smoking, I try"" because there's the part with eating prudently and with thanksgiving, and also meat sparingly. Which I don't think the majority of us even follow properly. Both times I said "" I try!"" The bishop understood that as the abeforementioned.A few thoughts:

\~A word of wisdom- \*a word\* so it's one part, not the whole wisdom relating to food and health!

\~Personal Revelation! I suggest to take this a step further than just abstaining from the obvious no alcohol/tea plants or illegal drugs. Use the new church program for the children and youth, and set your goal in the physical area, to what next thing you can work on, according to your personal revelation.

I set my goal to add more beans to my diet because that's great fiber and other nutrients compared to just meat."
