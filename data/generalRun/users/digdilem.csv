You're right, I was probably over simplifying the vote results, there were many other factors at play that will have influenced things. Labour's anti-semitism row rumbles on and on, and Jeremy Corbyn is certainly not a popular leader. The Lib Dems, already decimated by their pact with the Tories under Cameron, desperately tried to win votes by appealing to remainers by making their entire manifesto about overturning the referendum. Both lost seats, Labour, 59 of them. That's a huge margin to give to the Tories and it will take a long time to recover some balance. 

I though during voting that people were not necessarily voting *for* someone, but they were voting *against* things. Corbyn as PM and Dianne Abbot as Deputy Prime Minister? When even Boris Johnson is seen as the best choice, something's muddled.

Frustrations about a deadlocked parliament and constant fighting and political sabotage has soured the public mood. We're fed up with it. These are our leaders, we chose them to lead us, but they're squabbling with our future instead of working together, more interested in political process than results.

facepalm,fg73ch8,t1_fg6bnm6,1580583027.0,"[If you downvote this, please take the effort to read it first]

There's lots of reasons, and I do expect to be downvoted here because the Reddit rhetoric is very much pro-remain and not representative of the entire UK. The majority voted to leave, and the most recent general election gave a massively strong mandate to the only significant party that was backing leave, which shows public sentiment has grown even more in favour of Brexit, not against it. Yet if you read Reddit, all we seem to see is the minority view. 

Just some reasons are...  (I don't hold all of these myself, but I talk to people and listen. I definitely don't hate Europe or the EU, I think the latter has done a lot of good for people in terms of laws and environmental changes)

The UK has never sat well with the EU bureaucracy and has never been as invested in it. (Note we kept our own currency). Maybe that is pride, or scepticism or financial good sense - but it's a signal that we have never been as on-board as, say, the French and Germans. There is a perception that we pay a lot of money yet have little influence on how it's spent.

Our government constantly reworks and picks apart EU legislation to the point where one wonders why bother? Much of this legislation was seen as overly verbose and pointless (straight bananas, emulsified offal tubes, etc ) Latter was fiction from Yes Minister, but very influenced by real events.

Lots of Europeans were against some of the weaker Eastern countries being admitted, and with the bail outs afforded to Greece because of the misreporting of their economy, it doesn't sit well with everyone. Why should most of Europe pay their taxes when a few countries don't? It's not fair.

Constant complaints from our fishing industry who are largely small self-owner boats, when massive factory ships from Europe eliminate stocks in one pass. (For an Island nation, this can be quite important) It's seem that we lost control of our waters and for those involved in that industry, this was seen as too much.

The agricultural subsidies are massive and have significantly changed how people farm everywhere. European grain mountains, anyone? 

Subsidies sometimes seem unfairly applied. Ie, the Spanish tomato festival - La Tomatina - where entire lorry loads of tomatoes are thrown around. Those were (maybe still are) grown with European subsidy. Money literally thrown down the drain.

The frankly ridiculous waste of money when the EU Parliament packs up and spends two days each month in France - because France said it wanted a piece of the action. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/10565686/The-farce-of-the-EU-travelling-circus.html

The European Superstate makes some feel uneasy. Remember that the EU started as the Common Market and existed for trade. That is what we joined and it changed. We're not sure if we want a European army (many alive are still influenced by the wars of the last century)

Most remainers seem to have latched onto immigration as a reason why the majority of the UK voted to leave. That is certainly true for some people - but remember those are the angriest and loudest people, and the easiest to pin reasons onto. The media have fixated on them and largely ignored those with other reasons. Those people angry with the vote have found it easy to use these racist and bigoted groups as demonised faces of all leave voters. That simply is not true.

Individually you can pick apart any one of these - and certainly some are unfair. But these are important matters for people and steered their vote. But we voted in a democratic way and the majority decided to leave. Only time will tell whether it was right or not."

The only way I can something can delete data across multiple systems is some over-arching process that hooks into each of them with admin access. Whether that's file systems, databases, document stores - whatever. The site seems vague about what data is, unless it's everything.

If it's this then:

1. That's a massive, and I mean MASSIVE, security weakness. Especially as you'll be giving that access to a a third party.

2. A more than acceptable risk of something going wrong and deleting everything. Oh, and forget about backups, because they will have deleted those too - or insisted you can't have any.

3. Not sure how it knows what data to keep (system files, binaries, configs) and what to expire.

Also the general concepts ""Keeping data"" - What is the reason for keeping this data? Is OP prepared to defend this reason in court? Will they be legally liable when this data gets compromised and someone's personal data is spread? If they had no good reason to have it or keep it, yeah, probably.

Also, potential misleading of the individual who thinks they have deleted a message. That's what prompted my response. You have to make this stuff very clear, not buried in the T&Cs. Saying ""but signal and whatsapp do it"" is probably not sufficient research.

Does OP also have the ability to honour SARs in his design? 

I'm citing concepts rather than specific bits of the legislation partly through laziness, but people who do are generally dicks wanting to get one over anyone who challenges them. My point here was to raise these concepts and laws to OPs awareness in building their system so they can do their own research and don't get bitten by it later when changing established codebases, or being fined, is costly. 

It's like data security - build privacy into the system at the beginning, and you can't do that without at least broad awareness of the concepts in the areas you intend to operate - which in most apps is internationally. These privacy laws will spread around the world (see COPPA) and eventually get more enforced. The penalties are eye watering and it doesn't matter where you're based."
