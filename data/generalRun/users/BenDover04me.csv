The discussion with parents are always hard. Lots of emotional support, being empathetic, making sure they realize everything has been done (helps with closure), taking into consideration every aspect, and then opening up a dialogue about organ donation.

The few cases where patients (elderly people) are more accepting but still very hard. Informed decision is important. If we can make the suffering less and in shorter duration for a comfortable and more dignified passing, we plan and oblige."

Regarding cheat meals, try and avoid it for now or only do it every 6-8 weeks if you’re aiming for faster weight loss. Since you’re calorie restricting, any additional calorie intake may be stored (deprivation mode). Your body is adjusting, let it use the fat for energy for now."
