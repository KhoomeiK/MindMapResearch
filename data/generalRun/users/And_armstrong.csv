AskReddit,ffbrj8s,t3_esrjum,1579779932.0,"As the name suggests, The Grimace was originally one of the many Demon creatures of the Golden Arches realm representing the seven deadly sins.

This unsightly creature, spawned from pure hatred for gluttony, traditionally lurked in the shadows, observing with painful judgement those enjoying the fruits of Ronald McDonald’s finest cuisine.

Grimace’s twisted expressions, cast utter contempt & disgust upon the gluttonous enjoying their ‘happy’ meal of udder & hoof formed patty, flaccid pink goo beverages and/or questionable nuggets.

Such judgement & vile detest comes from his/her? (gender unknown) own grotesque body form & self hatred.

In recent years the Mc-characters have undergone extensive rebranding by the various marketing departments of the organisation to improve sales and to hide their true sinister connections, thus the scary clown, kleptomaniac burger thief & the various associated mutant creatures are hidden behind a thin veil of cartoonish approachability whilst their dark intent still lingers.

As part of the rebranding, The Grimace’s many limbs are now hidden from view, much like a nightmare spider creature (or that thing in Mortal Combat). If angered it’s true form may be unleashed."

Their gut bacteria & stomach acidity differ from ours greatly making them pretty resilient to such things but many sources advise to contact your vet. “ Watch your pet closely for any listlessness, vomiting, diarrhea, or lack of appetite” 


Certain parasites could be a concern such as worms, or other factors such as rat poison within the dead animal.


If your dog seems happy & healthy, you’ve probably got nothing to worry about! They stick much worse things in their mouths daily anyway!

If you’re worried seek professional advice."
