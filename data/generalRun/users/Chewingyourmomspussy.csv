depression,fdqxsrp,t3_emr4dw,1578676362.0,"It certainly can be. I was a pretty happy child, before i've got bullied in 6th and 7th grade. The worst thing was, that the people who bullied me, had been my friends just a little earlier on. Since then I have trust issues, when it comes to my friends. Normal teasing and especialy fights with my friends often lead to days and nights of me constantly thinking, that they aren't truly my friends. I'd say nowadays my social skills are alright, but I often have the feeling, that people hate me, while I talk to them. Today I am actually friends with one of the guys, who used to bully me and am on good terms with the other guys too. They're good people now, but children are just massive cunts sometimes."
depression,fdqvb1j,t3_emnbdm,1578675389.0,"As many other people have written before me, get a divorce! Trying to stay together, is only gonna harm yourself and later on your daughter, if she has to grow up in such a shit show. Often reddit quickly jumps to the answer:""dump her/him"", when certain issues could be talked out. Yet, under your circumstances, it's really the only answer. She cheated on you and very clearly doesn't care about you any longer. Get a divorce lawyer and tell him everything in great detail, I am very certain you will get custody for your child. You should also seek medical help for your mental problems. I wish you all the luck in the world!"
depression,fdqtq5k,t1_fdq34ea,1578674678.0,">There's nothing worse (besides abuse) than growing up with parents who hate each other but refuse to split up.

True. My parents haven't had a functioning relationship for most of my life. It sucks to be stuck in the middle of two parents hating eachother. I love both my parents, but I hate to listen to them, complaining about eachother all the fucking time. I think growing up under these circumstances is one of the reasons, I've got so many issues today. Please, for the sake of your children and yourself end the relationship, if you stop loving eachother. A divorce seemed bad to me as a young child, but looking back on it now, I wished my parents would have gotten one, instead of ""staying together for the children"". It's the best thing for everybody."
