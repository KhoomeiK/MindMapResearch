This is the key part for me.

If OP’s husband had already decided on financial support only (no relationship with the child) then he probably doesn’t want to attend the funeral.

If OP’s husband hadn’t entirely decided on the extent of his involvement in his child’s life but was likely to have a relationship with the child and he wants to attend the funeral then he should go. 

Whether OP attends is up to her and cannot blame her for not attending. I think, as suggested by another commenter, that the husband’s sister attending with him could be a good option. It provides the husband support without that support needing to come from OP. 

I think OP needs to acknowledge her husband’s loss and his attending the funeral explicitly does that. Then they can go back to working on their marriage without the child’s funeral potentially becoming an issue in the future."

Personally I would pretty much stop responding to any more questions about whether you are going (you have advised you are not attending) and definitely stop explaining why you are not going.

Do not give anyone (parents included) any specific information about your exams such as dates etc. That type of information allows the aunt to plan a way for you to attend for a really short amount of time. You don’t want to have to explain that you won’t be flying in at midnight the night before and leaving on the first flight after the reception.

Your boy’s pupils look ok (not too dilated) so I’m guessing his vision is ok. Do his eyes always follow you as you walk around? I noticed my girl would be looking at me and then she’d keep staring straight ahead (where I was) as I walked away.

How is his hearing? If you tap on a wall behind him or click your fingers behind his ears does he turn his head? Does he sometimes startle if you pat him even though he’s awake (didn’t hear you approaching)?

My vet recommended just ignoring her yowling ~~as~~ otherwise it encourages the behaviour. It took some time but she reduced (I used to count how many) and then stopped her yowling. Now she’ll meow at me for food if I take too long and she stills meows a “thanks” afterwards.

It was hard to ignore her at first. I would sneak to the doorway to make sure she was ok and slink away unseen. She’s my only cat (21 years) and as far as I’m concerned she can do no wrong, even if she throws up several times at 2am. 

I understand wanting to make sure your old guy is ok and not leaving him locked up when he’s done nothing wrong. Maybe watch his behaviour to see if it’s any different as the house move might just be highlighting what was already happening with him. I hope you can work it out.

I understand the above comment was made in respect to wills however I hope families have discussed end of life expectations especially with elderly parents or anyone diagnosed as terminally ill.

They can be tough conversations but it makes it a lot easier for the family if they know what an individual wants/ wanted. As a family we discussed treatment vs quality of life, nursing homes and cremation vs burial when my mum was both initially diagnosed and then again when she progressed to terminal.

relationships,ffd53pi,t3_essm1j,1579813592.0,"If your dad’s will was written before you were born then it’s highly possible your mum’s is the same. You must ensure she updates her will or you risk having to hire a lawyer to receive anything let alone a fair share from the joint estates. 

[I assume you would at least receive the apartment as you mentioned joint title however (am not a lawyer) that may depend on how your mum’s will is written. Also if a mortgage exists on the property that may be impacted by the will. These are reasons to make sure you are in your mum’s current will.]

Your mum has started the conversation, which is a good sign. It seems like she is trying to be transparent at least. You now **need** to continue the conversation.

Personally I would sit down and ask your mum if she has a current will, when it was written and if you are included. Also ask her what she and your dad had planned for their entire estate. Hopefully she will say it was to be split 50/50 property wise (one property to sister, one property to you and the third property shared).

Then ask your mum if she realises that now splitting her two properties 50/50 means that their joint estate (mum and dad) will be split 66/33 in favour of sister. That is also from a property perspective, the split is probably greater from a financial/ dollar point of view considering the values of each property. 

Ask your mum if she would consider writing her will so the split of her and your dad’s estate is equal for you and your sister. 

And follow up with whatever is agreed. Also please make sure you are in her current will. 

I understand you feeling the way you do. It’s not unreasonable. Yes, no-one should feel entitled to their parents’ estate however if there is one, and assuming there has been no falling outs within the immediate family, then it’s fair to want an equal share. More so, it’s understandable to feel upset that a sibling will receive more simply because an old will wasn’t updated or originally written in a way that considered future children.

Still NTA but reading the above, personally, I would;
- write a list of all contracts - what the service is, whose name they are in (yours or parents), and who paid (you or parents),
- cancel all the contracts that are 100% yours,
- if contracts are in your name but paid by parents AND are personal choices (e.g. flowers etc), I would advise parents the contracts have been ( or are being) cancelled,
- if contracts are in your name but paid by parents AND are **not** personal choices or you are not overly attached (e.g. venue or minister etc), I would advise parents all other contracts have been (or are being) cancelled and to let you know by xx date if they want these particular contracts cancelled so they can get some of the deposits returned, and
- if contracts are in parents names and paid by them, I would let them know that all other contracts have been (or are being) cancelled and they need to cancel by xx date to receive a partial refund of their deposits.

The above lets your sister and parents know that you do not condone your sister taking over your wedding. If your sister and parents wish to push ahead with the date then some of the money your parents put in won’t be wasted as they can continue those contracts that are generic in nature (like venues) but all contracts that personalised the event as your wedding (e.g. decor, catering, cake etc) have been cancelled and they need to plan accordingly.

Your sister may have helped plan your wedding but hopefully you still had final say on everything. If there’s anything she suggested and you didn’t want or didn’t mind either way, and it was paid for by your parents, then let them choose if those contracts are cancelled. However, if your sister seriously took over and the wedding didn’t feel like you then I’d probably cancel the lot.

I’d try to get the dress back too. Keep your receipt with you when you go to collect it so you can show you own the dress, in case it’s required. Then sell it or revamp it. Alternatively, if you don’t care about the dress then I’d take some sharp scissors too, you only need to get near it, not take it away.

Oh, I’m assuming your bridesmaids (if you are having any) are on your side. If they have their dresses then make sure they know not to hand them over to your sister willingly. If the bridesmaids paid it probably gets complicated and if the sister offers to buy, make sure the bridesmaids know to get paid upfront. If you paid and the dresses are at the store then cancel or collect (and sell).

Accutane,fdxi3wq,t1_fdvxxgz,1578768887.0,"I get dry lips if I forget to drink enough water over a couple of days. Unfortunately I have two rare side effects (excessive sweating and irregular periods). My derm is hoping that lowering the dose will help minimise these (hasn’t yet) but honestly I am ok with them  in exchange for clear, non-oily skin."

10mg daily first month, 
20mg daily next four months, 
10mg daily following three months,

Dermatologist is happy to keep me on low dose long term so trying to work out what suits my skin;
10mg three times per week for three months,
10mg two times per week for three months (I didn’t last the three months as my skin got too oily for my liking after a month odd on this dose, went back up to 10mg three times per week),
5mg five times per week for three months (derm wants me to try to reduce to 5mg four times per week)."
Accutane,fdv7f8h,t3_en4225,1578744212.0,"Make an appt with your derm again. In the meantime (assuming it might take a few weeks to see your derm), see your local dr and ask about topical options such as Differin (Adapalene retinoid gel) or ClindaTech (clindamycin solution).

Best of luck."

AmItheAsshole,fdpx00f,t1_fdpuu2s,1578644040.0,"I have different reactions to all my food allergies but, for me, the milk one is excruciating. It’s like repeated knife stabbings in my left side, between my rib cage and hip. I have to try and breathe through it. It generally kicks in between 15 to 30 minutes after eating and lasts around 30 seconds to a minute or so.  Sometimes I’ll get a second or third set of pain 10 to 15 minutes (thereabouts) later but most of the time it’s just one.

My allergies were picked up by a skin prick allergy test but if you think you might have an allergy or intolerance it might be worth writing down what you ate previously each time it happens. You may then notice a pattern. (Edit: I should add; See a dr to confirm. My dr had me do a food elimination diet and keep a food diary as I reintroduced each food. That’s how I know the different reactions to each food.)

Best of luck because that pain is unique and it would really suck if you don’t know the cause."

OP, if you are planning a long term relationship with this guy then this needs to change his thinking."
