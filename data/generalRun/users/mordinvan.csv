How do you keep them from harming other prisoners while keeping their confinement humane?  Love to hear that too.

You ARE choosing to allow, through cowardice and inaction for innocent to be harmed by the convicts who escape.  This is the choice you are making.  I choose differently.

I don't want to kill all murderers.  Just those who are likely to reoffend against the innocent. I however have no problem killing virtually any criminal who is likely to reoffend against the innocent. Rapists, murderers, fraudsters, serial home invasion... Doesn't matter to me, if the innocent are at threat from your predations, and it is unlikely you will ever stop, then you need to die."

Some people need killing, and if keeping another victim of a rapist, or sociopathic killers requires the occasional mistake, then society has to make a choice.  It can either occasionally kill and innocent person quickly and clearly.  Compensating the estate of the victim, and doing it's best to correct for whatever crack allowed it to happen, or a child, or woman, or man can be rapped and/or murdered, often in horrific ways, by an escaped convict, and their family has no recourse at all.
