My husband died one year to the day after we quit of a heart attack. I never smoked another cigarette since November 16, 2005. 
My story leads to this, If we let our bad habits go on eventually there will be consequences. My husband never was able to quit. My prayers will be for you  that God intervenes early so you do not have bad consequences."
