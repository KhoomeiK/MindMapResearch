It's annoying that I'm being positioned into defending Koby fucking Bryant. Just because I'm not agreeing with the mob doesn't mean I think the situation was benign.

Fuck Americans are stupid. You have to spell out every goddamn caveat and disclaimer or they lose their minds."
Foodforthought,ffvz6s8,t1_ffvkqvd,1580277964.0,"Yes. I'm aware of what you were suggesting. It goes to my point: she made demands of him and they were filled. It's like you think he was convicted; it's like you think the victim's choices weren't good enough. The only way you can get away with calling him a rapist now is because he's dead. Why? Because under most other circumstances such a phrase would a prima facia case for libel. 

She sought a private remedy and got it. He made a public statement as part of the settlement. Authorities didn't construe it as a statement of guilt. He didn't admit anything. But everyone got what they wanted and moved on. 

Listen, this is just my opinion. No need to keep up the rebuttals. But I'm not goint to agree with you."

Foodforthought,ffvbwcf,t1_ffvak4t,1580260484.0,"Well, trials are supposed to be harrowing. That's why they're called trials. Trials can be gruelling, and a grind for everyone. There's a reason courts generally push for settlements. 


>Also he most likely committed traumatic sexual violence. This can haunt victims for the rest of their lives.  Meanwhile, he lived a pretty sweet life...with millions of adoring fans who will never think of him as a rapist, in addition to basketball legend.

I think this overlooks the bargain made between Kobe and the woman. She sought a private remedy for her harms. She could have pushed the criminal case and destroyed Bryant's career forever. This wouldn't even be a discussion. 

She instead sought a civil settlement that left Bryant's life mostly intact. This wasn't a failure of justice. This was her choice. Even now we're resurrecting her harms after she specifically sought to keep those harms behind an NDA. 

I think both parties wanted closure, they negotiated closure, and we won't let it close."
Foodforthought,ffvaz6w,t1_ffv4s0c,1580259860.0,Agreed. If he was convicted after trial this would be a non-issue for me. But the plaintiff chose to negotiate her justice. I don't see why Bryant shouldn't get the benefit of that bargain.
Foodforthought,ffv9ozt,t1_ffv7m0s,1580259003.0,"Juries decide facts. There was no jury. You're essentially convicting him without benefit of trial. 

It was also reported that she appeared at her medical evaluation with another man's semen and pubic hair in her underpants. Should we say that evidence 'clearly' shows  another perpetrator was responsible for the lacerations? 

See how pointless this exercise is? Without benefit of due process, this is just mob rule.

I prefer not to second-guess the victim's decision. She felt satisfied with her choice. Why can't you?"
Foodforthought,ffv2t8g,t1_ffv1r6f,1580254370.0,"We'll never know the veracity of the recovered evidence as it wasn't evaluated at trial. We can spend a lot of time throwing ""evidence"" around, but what use is that (edit: in this setting)?

Bryant wasn't ""let off."" Again, the victim chose to pursue a civil remedy. We like to discount this route but it's the way the victim chose to make herself whole. 

I'm aware of how brutal rape can be. I've read plenty of cases on the issue."
Foodforthought,ffuzacm,t1_ffuvwz9,1580252213.0,"I think she made her choices though. Victims drive a lot of modern jurisprudence and she chose to pursue a civil remedy. She settled the issue privately and that should limit the public discourse on the matter, IMO. 

Bryant didn't commit a crime against humanity. He wasn't a warlord or dictator. I mean, should he have the same kind of asterisk next to other historical figures? Especially in the absence of evidence evaluated under due process? 

I don't know. I'm not a ""sports guy"" but the issue was settled among the parties and I think he should be able to die in peace."

science,ffdw3nj,t3_eswz5j,1579830377.0,"From a legal perspective ""domestic violence"" runs the spectrum of a broken jaw to a single compression bruise ( least physical touching).

The Lautenberg amendment is the controlling statute and includes a firearms ban for DV restraining orders. Physical abuse isn't required to obtain a DV restraining order (at least in CA). 

I have a problem with it. Everyone deserves to be free from violence. But  treating DV as a ""special"" crime of violence is an issue for me.

We don't ban guns from a persons engaging in misdemeanor street brawls; or two non-cohabitating friends; or two business partners. Historically a misdemeanor never resulted in the permenant loss of rights or property (with the exception of 'short term' jail sentences).  

I just don't believe the ""shouldn't hurt loved ones"" pitch. Each individual is entitled to define those roles for themselves. Just because two people are fucking doesn't make their relationship worthy of special protection, it doesn't mean they love each other, it doesn't mean they owe each other any elevated duties. It just means they like to fuck.

Fucking is the only difference that separates the groups of strangers from groups of ""romantic loved ones."""

todayilearned,fep01tj,t1_feoxtpk,1579309122.0,"Well, it was a thought experiment. I don't think it was about the cars. It was meant to stimulate an ethics discussion about progress and politics. 

I was set to agree with you, honestly. Then I considered all the non-human life automobiles also destroy, not including infrastructure and CO2 contributions. 

Ignoring that, however, I can agree with you in terms of numbers. That's the trick though. Our agreement requires us to paint over a significant loss of life.  40,000 is a small-to-moderate sized town. What if you saw a town where all 40,000 people were dead? Shocking.

What about those people who died? Remember, they're innocent. They had every right to exist and we just agreed that it's okay for them to be dead because cars are a net positive...crazy right?

todayilearned,feov71l,t1_feoaj23,1579306129.0,"See how this argument works though? Its premise requires the unspoken assertion that individual lives are interchangable i.e. ""It's fine we lost 40,000 people because we saved 80,00 over here.""

todayilearned,feoufr6,t1_feorwzn,1579305680.0,"He isn't questioning whether technology is helpful. He's critiquing what we sacrifice to have it.

Climate change is the global example set to rack up perhaps millions in losses of both human, and non-human life. 

Technology has saved lives but that argument impliedly devalues the lives we lost. Those who have died in the name of automobiles would likely prefer a world where they're alive and everybody rides a bike."

True, an appeal to common sense is not a legal defense. We don't ""leave common sense at the door"" when analyzing the law, however. Nor are juries expected to avoid common sense when considering the facts. 

There's broad latitude in what can be said at closing. Simply because an argument has no legal effect does not mean it still can't sway a jurist - be those in the box, or on the bench. 

I wasn't suggesting that King would be convicted defacto. It was a turn of phrase you've taken too literally. 

As to King's citizenship: non-citizens can be held accountable for crimes committed on foreign soil. Further, King's Canadian distributor is ostensibly Canadian. 

Still, I come from a system where the freedom of expression is broadly construed. So this man's trial seems rather abhorrent and backward in the context of speech. It's basically a thought-crime where the prosecution simply guessed what the defendants thoughts were and proved him guilty.

Libertarian,fcsyrni,t3_ehqwll,1577928488.0,">If New York had laws and a culture similar to Texas, no one would have the courage to invade such a party nor would they be so successful with a knife attack.

Someone had the courage to invade the Texas church in spite of Texas laws and culture though. Knowing that random Texans are armed did not dissuade the attempt. 

Conversly, the NYC attacker could not know if his prospective victims would passivley accept their fate. NY also hasn't outlawed all firearms. Just as random Texans may be carrying firearms, random NY buildings may contain a gun. Thus, like the Texas attacker, the NYC attacker made his attacks with calculated risk.

It seems that the actual risk of being shot is not always deterrent for those who decide to abandon self-preservation."
LateStageCapitalism,fcs2bi3,t3_ei3llb,1577910387.0,"Exterminating billionaires is morally indefensible and absolutely necessary. 

This is the switch-track problem: a train with 500 passengers is heading toward a cliff. We can save those 500 by switching the track but kill 100  people trapped on the track. 

The logic is clear: we must eliminate the 100 to save the 500. We must eliminate the billionaires to save untold lives, both human and non-human. Billionaires must die so that the only planet in the universe known to harbor life can survive.  

It is the only way."
Foodforthought,fcoysi8,t1_fco5mjq,1577845341.0,"Nah. 

Many leftists happened to notice that  conservative proclamations of ""morality, duty, obligation, etc"" makes some people rich and most of us poor, miserable, and ready to die. 

Why do the rich get to decide what ""morality, duty, obligation, etc"" mean? 

It's disturbing that conservatives refuse to acknowledge the role of their political philosophies in the undoing of the things they claim to love. They've had a huge hand in legislation for the past 40 years but act like they've been a permanent minority."

California,fckh3u0,t1_fck2p55,1577725195.0,"Where are you getting your ideas? Why are you so confident that life is ""supposed"" to work in the way that you're suggesting? 

Who says that single people don't need their own place? What if I told you that my grandmother was a teller in the late forties and could afford her own San Francisco apartment. So could my other grandmother who was raised in San Francisco by a seamstress and a cobbler/fisherman. 

My in-laws (in their late sixties/early seventies) regularly talk about their own apartments at ages 18, 19, and beyond. 

You have no historical perspective."
