bloodborne,ff5gx9z,t1_ff3oh2q,1579592368.0,"That’s true for almost any game out there, after playing a Soul."
DarkSouls2,ff3w5p1,t1_ff3v97u,1579550162.0,"If you’ve got a nice pc it’s emulated quite well! 
And in some aspects it’s even better than Dark Souls. It’s darker, more mysterious, lots of different environments. I’d like to replay that too. If only ps now had it in its European catalogue!"
DarkSouls2,ff3vx57,t1_ff3uwcq,1579550016.0,"I got to admit I could not find DS3 dlcs enjoyable, and I skipped. 
For me what made DS2/3 inferior to the first was the fact that the worlds areas were not interconnected like in the first one."
DarkSouls2,ff3scmu,t3_er82ff,1579547802.0,"Dark Souls 2 problem is that it came out after the first Dark Souls, that is simply a masterpiece. Not even DS3 is anywhere near the first one imo."
tifu,ff3s2s3,t3_er7i1t,1579547633.0,"Lol. Last year my son started chaining words, in a seemingly casual way and order. Until blasphemy, real bad blasphemy, came out of his mouth, leaving me and his mothers like “whaaaaaaat?!?!?”."
bloodborne,ff3rrft,t3_er5yx8,1579547440.0,I remember having tons of problems with Laurence. Then +10 pizza slicer came into my life.
bloodborne,feyydml,t1_feylzpm,1579451994.0,Lead elixir helps too. But you can also cheese them later from the tunnels.
thisismylifenow,fet01uh,t1_fep3edc,1579370554.0,Have you ever tried contact lenses? It’s like living in another world. It’s like going 4K after a life at 720p (well more like 320i).
thisismylifenow,feszg3r,t1_fenoee0,1579370452.0,"I only clean mine when I arrive at the office in the morning. Only there I can find the right towels that will dry them the right way, after using hot water and soap."
thisismylifenow,fesz6mf,t3_eq3qs3,1579370376.0,Try opening the oven with those on!
tifu,fesyssn,t3_eq59kp,1579370256.0,Honestly I didn’t understand whether you are above average or magnums are more comfortable even if you are average.
bloodborne,fesiis7,t3_eqbvw9,1579365554.0,That’s ter-rick-fic!
bloodborne,ferd2oz,t3_eq8omw,1579352502.0,"I remember my first time. I got brutally murdered countless times. 
Then I found out he had 2 daughters and everything became simple."
bloodborne,fenfxfe,t1_femu47j,1579283835.0,Pizza cutter is the best weapon. I’d love to have infinite stamina just to kill all the orphan of kos worshippers outside his place!
bloodborne,fejbe66,t3_epce1v,1579165482.0,Amazing. From Software is the best.
bloodborne,feeyt27,t1_feewke9,1579044203.0,"He saw visceral the big guy that’s beateing on the gate in central yharnam, he was like “dad... you’re sticking your hand in that guy’s butts”. It was a bit hard to explain..."
bloodborne,feesrg9,t1_fees5v5,1579040422.0,"I just shared this to laugh on it, often kids can be brutal with their naivety.

But we're in no way raising him to think gypsies are bad, that's why I'd like to know what he knows about it."
bloodborne,fedjzhz,t3_eogm1z,1579013444.0,"Actually I’m replaying the game in a super aggressive style, maybe Sekiro influenced me, and I found some bosses much less hard to take down. Aggression is the key!"
MinecraftMod,fed0qol,t1_fe6aawz,1578992882.0,"Thanks, I hoped there was something ready, it looks I’ll have to work on it when he’s not around!"
bloodborne,fdx0m8y,t1_fduw0az,1578764128.0,"Now you descend into real hell, don’t worry, you’ll have a lot to do."
