I should clarify it wasn't the clues being laid out that made me suspect, it was just cynicism/skepticism based a ""seen it all"" mentality I once possessed, and also on how often Revan is being mentioned by other characters. Plus it was weird that you had visions of an incident that Bastila Shan was the only survivor.

The real beauty of the twist isn't the twist itself but, how wonderfully Bioware shoved the clues laid out previously, in my fat, cynical face. I loved every minute of it."
