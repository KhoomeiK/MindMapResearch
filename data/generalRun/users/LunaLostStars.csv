My own dumbass’s fault for loosing them though. I was a pretty dumb kid like “oh I know where they are.” Then coming back at lunch expecting kids not to of found them, dug them up and moved/taken them, and I never checked lost property. Can tell ya my family wasn’t overly impressed with that one."

AskReddit,fff6kev,t3_esse9d,1579876999.0,"I was probably around 7. 
Myself and my grandparents were walking through the shopping mall when I saw this probably 5’11” women with bleach blonde hair right down to her ankles. To this day I remember her and my only explanation to why I remember her is probably because my nana always tells me I can’t have hair past my lower back and she just stunned me with her hair length I guess"

AskReddit,ffam3w1,t3_esbeba,1579739156.0,"The whole dumping water thing. Every airport I’ve been to makes you dump out your water to go through security, and if it’s not dumped, they sometimes throw your bottles that you paid for out. I get that it’s for security reasons and I’m behind that for the safety of everyone if there’s anything dangerous but sometimes I wish they’d just get something to test the water quickly for anything and move on with it. It just stresses me out not having water on me. 
And at least have somewhere nice to dump it and not into bins where it gets wasted and then not even having refill stations on the other side of security."
