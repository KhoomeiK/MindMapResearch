We pulled over and assessed the VERY minimal damage (long story short, the bumpers did their job), and took a moment to be glad that no one was hurt. 

Imagine your daughter seeing that her new boy/girlfriend texted her and she just HAD to read it right away. How long would that take? An instant? 2? She could be dead in that time. 

You took this as seriously as you needed to. Sadly some people only get the wake up call after someone has died. I hope dearly that no one is hurt in the process of your daughter learning this lesson."

CatsAreAssholes,fdkxowc,t1_fdkvkm0,1578513300.0,"I don’t think pets should be allowed to roam around outside unsupervised. That’s my opinion. I would never encounter a problem where my cat would miss the outdoors because I never let her go outdoors. My cat was feral when I adopted her and now she loves napping in my bed and sitting on my dresser. I think keeping cats indoors is the best way to care for a cat, aside from taking them out on a leash and harness just like a dog. 

This post is about a cat owner whose pet is getting ill from the time it spends unsupervised, they should keep their cat inside. 

I also think all cats should be kept inside, and that’s my opinion. I don’t really care if someone thinks I’m a bad cat owner, because I think letting a domesticated animal roam around the neighborhood getting into who-knows-what is being a bad cat owner, so we’re at an impasse. 

For the record I in fact hate going outside so no, I wouldn’t miss it"
CatsAreAssholes,fdkukii,t1_fdkn4c8,1578511458.0,"We’re seeing tons of people taking cats for walks in harnesses now, so I think it’s catching on that cats shouldn’t just be let loose, just like we don’t let dogs run wild 24/7. Hopefully more and more people learn that outdoor cats aren’t a good idea."
CatsAreAssholes,fdkuaj5,t1_fdkbsvg,1578511295.0,"In this situation I’d say that while you love the cat, give it food and consider it a pet, that you aren’t quite as responsible for its health— that’s not a criticism, it’s not possible to monitor what a feral animal eats, all you can do is provide food in the event they come around hungry. 

I don’t support having “outdoor cats” (I don’t care how normal it is, for the record, since that’s been a common response), but that’s not what I would call your feral friend, it seems more like you’re just making sure it’s ok even if you can’t bring it into your home. I’d prefer taking that cat off the street but I’m not holding you or any individual responsible for that. 

This cat owner has a domestic cat with a sensitive stomach and a weight problem. Just seems like it would help to keep it inside instead of just letting who-knows-what go on while its gone. No diet will work if they’re not monitoring the animal at all times."
