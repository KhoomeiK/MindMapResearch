bikewrench,ff5a4s8,t1_ff4tsb3,1579584883.0,"Its probably not the axle spacing. There should be a small amount of play in the cones before the wheel is mounted and locked into place. Slowly clamp the QR skewer while wiggling the rim side to side. If the side-side play disappears when the QR skewer is most of the way to all of the way closed then you should be good. It should be noted that a very small amount of play is better than over-tightening the cones. You can check to make sure that the cones are not over-tightened by clamping a weight to one of the spokes near the valve stem, bringing the weight to just above horizontal, letting the weight fall, and observing the pendulum motion of the wheel. The wheel should swing a few times before the weight returns to a stable position. If the wheel stops suddenly after a few swings, the bearings are probably too tight."

aww,feptfvt,t1_fept5hy,1579330680.0,I know. I was just agreeing with u/rickiver that the Jerry Springer show was more transparent about being manipulative and shitty.

AskReddit,fepoef7,t1_fepo6yx,1579326020.0,I come from a family of elementary and high school teachers. The struggle is real. What do you teach?
AskReddit,fepnx77,t1_fepjt4u,1579325609.0,"Teaching is hard AF. Was a TA in Grad School. Them college kids really don't want to learn shit. In all seriousness, teaching intro level courses was super difficult because you have to cater to people with all sorts of academic backgrounds. I can't imagine teaching primary or secondary. One time I had to explain to one student, during lab, that you can divide the overall distance that an object traveled by the overall time it took to get there to get the average speed of the object. I do not know how they graduated HS without knowing this, but they were in my class so I tried my best to fill their knowledge gaps."
AskReddit,fepn5d2,t3_eqbn5b,1579324962.0,"Loner here. Do well in class, but do not psych yourself out about grades. They matter, but they are not as important as you think. The beauty of the American educational system is that you can always move up. Did poorly in High School? Go to community college get good grades and transfer to a  University. I know a bunch of brilliant people in my field (Geophysics) with PhDs from prestigious universities that did exactly that. Also if you fuck up real bad and have no direction after High School, you can always go into the military (don't join the Marines though).

Spend time and figure out what you really like to do. You'll need that shit in the future to keep yourself together when things get bad, for me its building, fixing, and riding bikes.

Find genuinely good people with common interests. Do not try to be friends with people for stupid political reasons.

Learn how to fail, be uncomfortable, and embrace uncertainty, that shit is like 90% of life."

bikewrench,fep37fe,t1_fep2k8f,1579311118.0,"Probs. My little shop in my Apt. consists of an Aldi bikestand, a truing stand (knockoff parktool TS-1), and an ornery cat. Just no vice, as I would need a more solid desk to mount it to. So, Id say that I am pretty spoiled as well :)"
aww,fep2wu5,t1_fep2pan,1579310932.0,"My Grandma actually had cable, so I'd get to watch the history channel when I went over to her house. That was before the history channel sucked ass though."
aww,fep2l1x,t1_fep1vlb,1579310725.0,"Yup. The older Jerry Springer episodes are freaking insane. Its weird because people always talk about how cable TV is too violent and sexually inappropriate for children. Well, I grew up watching broadcast TV after school, which pretty much consisted of Cops, Jerry, Tuesday's with Morrie, and Judge Judy. Needless to say, as a naive kid, my perception of the average person was pretty shitty."
aww,fep1itl,t1_feozgih,1579310052.0,"I can't see anyone thinking, after watching an episode, that the Jerry Springer show is about actually resolving anyone's problems. I mean come on, half the show consists of homely chicks flashing their mamms."
bikecommuting,feoz28p,t1_feope2d,1579308499.0,IMO F makes more sense for weather. You'll probs die at 0F without proper clothing on and you'll probs die at 100F without the proper clothing / water.
bikecommuting,feoys4v,t1_fen4xkv,1579308325.0,"Dude, I am a Midwesterner living in the PNW. It got down to like 18F this week and I had to walk to work (instead of bike), which is three miles away from my house. All of my co-workers thought I was going to die or something. Also most of them wear freaking parkas when its 30F out hahaha."
bikecommuting,feoybjf,t1_femn047,1579308032.0,"Yeah. I like bikes with OEM fenders. Aftermarket fenders just never end up with a good fender line IMO. That bike looks pretty nice. Although I am not too familiar with those tektro brakes. They look pretty old-school though, which is neat."

For reference, my favorite position on the drops is on the ramps. In this position the horizontal curve of the drops sits in the palm of my hand. I know, I am weird. When I want to get into an aerodynamic position I ride on the hoods with my forearms nearly horizontal. Also I live in the PNW, but I have been fine with v's and cantis before."

bikewrench,fee44w3,t1_fedn0pk,1579026006.0,"They are useful for removing freewheels. I generally use either a 1"" socket and a breaker bar or a 12"" Crescent wrench and a rubber mallet to break them free."

bikewrench,fdv9rvn,t3_en4qyi,1578745075.0,"Using a torque wrench is pretty useless unless you have a specific torque spec that you know. There are general guidelines for different diameters and thread pitches, but the material, grade (yield strength), and lubrication of the fastener can affect the torque spec aswell. If you know all of the above then you can, making some assumptions, calculate a reasonable torque.  Also remember that most torque wrenches need to be calibrated after a while, otherwise they could be off by a considerable amount. Just go buy one from harbor freight. They are \~$10 on sale and work pretty well. If you are working with carbon, you'll need a more precise wrench."

bikewrench,fdowvon,t1_fdog8h7,1578614720.0,Yes ditch the steel rims. They are terrible for braking. Also new brake pads asap.
EDC,fdowkep,t1_fdnt4q6,1578614513.0,I just pack what ever I would normally carry in my pockets into the fanny pack. That way if I stop at a shop on my way to/from work I have my wallet and phone in an easy to access place instead of being tucked away in my panniers. Also you can put one ear bud in for google map directions when you need them.
EDC,fdnk833,t1_fdn8b9s,1578587540.0,Fanny packs are great for bike commuting btw.

BikeCammers,fdmdq7g,t3_em3fe4,1578546591.0,"Driver is wrong. You always need to merge into the left or right most lane to turn left or right (unless there are two or more turn lanes). The bike lane counts as a traffic lane and that is why a lot of bike lanes have dashed boundary lines leading up to an intersection. The dashes mean that cars can merge into the bike lane to turn safely. It is always a good idea to yield to people turning but you do not have to (I mean you do have to because cars are bigger than you but in principle you do not).

Edit: [Here](https://www.bikemn.org/education/minnesota-bicycling-handbook/bicycle-road-markings-a-signs) is a good resource about bike lane markings in the US (it might pertain to other countries idk)."

But nearly every time I am at a show some asshole tries to push me into the mosh pit, unacceptable. All the aggressive stuff at shows is fine if it is consensual, otherwise its just shitty violent behavior."
bikewrench,fdfknz7,t1_fdf6pbm,1578363925.0,Also make sure to get the correct lockring wrench. There are a lot that look similar but have different radii.

There is nothing in the post that would suggest it is supposed to be humorous. There is no bike related pun or anything, just a poorly worded story that does not make sense.
