SoccerNoobs,fcssw84,t3_einvk6,1577924274.0,"You get this question a lot in here . Recommend to search for good answers.

At a quick / high level it’s very easy. Forget the notions of leagues and franchises for a moment that you’re used to. 

Football is simply a collection of clubs - like local establishments - that put together 23 guys to go play football against other teams. 

At some point they formed that into an official league. Then more and more clubs kept springing up, so they made divisions. You start in the lowest division and work your way up. If you’re bad , you get demoted. If good - you win and get promoted. This way you’re playing against other clubs at your level. To this day, you can technically make a random club with your friends , join some crappy league - and eventually if you win in every single division you’d end up in the top league playing against Real Madrid. 

It’s really that simple. Once the leagues became engrained, they introduced a cup which basically every league has. The cup is a tournament that runs in parallel to the league, and all the teams in the country can potentially qualify for the cup. This allows the bottom clubs from low divisions to play the
Big clubs in top divisions, since they otherwise would never play each other. Cups work more like your NFL playoffs so should be easy to understand. 

Then years later... clubs from different countries wanted to test themselves versus other top club. So they made the various versions of what is today called the champions league - where the champions of each European country played each other. 

Hope that helps"
