And average people are definitely showing they are incapable of choosing.

that being said, yes, Christianity is unique by announcing their prophet is also God."

i am not sure you are aware that Judaism, Islam and Christianity have the exact same history - they are 3 monotheistic religions that were born out of the same thing. they are Abrahamic religions descending from mythology of Mesopotamia.

simply, they are based on same disturbing notions that people believed to be normal more than 2000 y ago."
books,ff6svad,t1_ff6rkj9,1579634185.0,"Of course. Humans are idiots. Especially politicians. Philosophers talking about something is one thing, people trying to do it is another. 


Yugoslavia was one of the rare good systems, but we needed it then. It made us aware that we didn't have to be slaves to others (parts of our territory were under fascists, Nazis etc.) and we battled the enemy, our Partisans won and started the socialist country. It was a great period of time and beating Nazism was one of our greatest achievements. We will never know if Yugoslavia would ever reach communism but it had some great things (power of workers, no unemployment, free health care etc.). 


But beside this example, there is way more examples in which Communism was only used as propagada to make people follow a certain number of egoistic politicians who were never Communists nor knew anything about it (like Stalin, as our intellectuals were constantly debunking his speeches) but who were using that ideology for their own profit. 

Any ideology in wrong hands is deadly, no doubt about it."

books,ff5pq8b,t1_ff5p2d4,1579605088.0,This is the question impossible. There was never a communist country in existence. Closest to Marxist thought were countries in socialist stage like Lenin's Russia/SU or Yugoslavia. But communism as a stage was never reached. Stalin was a capitalist and dismissed by all respected Marxist authors and intellectuals. He was the reason why Yugoslavia didn't want to join Soviet block and instead started Non-aligned movement.

I honestly didn't know, your comments are a bit hard to decipher. But if you actually talked about the whole field of economy being ""a dogma"", that is truly fascinating. I never heard of anything like that. Maybe then you should make a YouTube channel dedicated to your conspiracy. I am sure you would find audience for yourself, like everyone does."

But when every relevant name (wheter media, journalist or ex footballer) says Barca was the biggest of the decade - you know very well what they mean. 


If Ronaldo and Modrić won 15 balon d'ors together, Messi would still be the greatest ever - as we can see that, feel that, experience that. 


If RM won 25 trophies this decade, Barca would still be greater - as we saw that, felt that, experienced that. 


Whoever was alive to witness most of the El Clasicos, the manner in which we won CL against Man Utd etc. knows. And RM has numbers, yes. Numbers... titles...  Ramos goals in 94th min.   Where is the style?  Just no. No comparison.

Also the idea that somehow in capitalism you can showcase your talent and earn more is an utter lie. Thats not how any company works. We all have same salary and nobody is noticing which individual contributes more. They also don't care about your education, which does not guarantee you job  at all, or better income than your colleagues in case you have a job. So, basically everything works exactly the same as it did in socialism. (source: my family comes from socialist country, while i moved to western democracy)"

It's ""right now"" vs ""everlasting"", as always. As one of my professors in literature once said: ""would you choose sausage or Shakespeare?"" Well it depends, am i starving to death or am i fed. If i am starving, i will choose food. If i am not, i will choose knowledge. 

Philosophy is something that gives human race a meaning. Is it useless? Yes, if you are hungry. But useless in general? Absolutely not. 


If you are 18, going to uni for the first time,  you should not choose Philosophy. If you are 35 or 52, have a stable job and want to deepen your knowledge - Philosophy is the perfect choice."
