TumblrInAction,fff395i,t1_fff2koo,1579874518.0,"You’re right, it’s just that in a human case, it’s illegal if someone doesn’t consent, while an animal cannot do that. I get that the law says; therefore you are prohibited to engage in sexual activities with an animal. The animal case isn’t as strictly analogous to the human case as I made it out to be. I should’ve thought it through better, thanks!

TumblrInAction,fff2hki,t1_ffevxs4,1579873916.0,"To be fair, it’s pretty silly to say it’s illegal because you didn’t get consent, when an animal is completeley incapable of either giving or taking away consent. Not that I wan’t people to start fucking animals (although I’m sure many already are), I’m just saying."

If they were capable of understanding and could benefit from the things a human does and we deprived them of that, by say, forcing them to stay at home just waiting around for us to come back, then you could argue that we don’t deserve it.
