We ended up with more than $100 USD over the ticket price for the two of us. Shortly after that some army recruiters came up to us and promised free tickets if we signed up for a mailing list.

Of course we signed up. Free tickets and $100+ to spend on food and merch? At 16 years old who could resist?

My buddy and I are just  chilling and watching BMX races and I hear my name called on then intercom. I won a prize.

Oh karma, who can escape you? Did I mention that at the time I was an angsty teen runaway? My parents weren't and aren't stupid.

My dumbass 16 year old self didn't think about how I didn't sign up for any contest so they would have no reason to call my name to the prize booth.

I went to preschool with this girl. We got along well and one day she picked a dandelion and gave it to me. My response was ""girls aren't supposed to give boys flowers."" We got in trouble one day because we liked each other's t shirts so we switched them.

Flash forward to high school. I meet this girl. We have mutual friends, which we came to find out later. See, our friends have been trying to get us to meet each other for 2 years because they think we would make a good couple. It didn't happen because reasons.

We end up dating. I'm walking her home one day and we pass by the preschool. We both mention how we've gone to the same one and do the math. We met when we were 3.

Were teenagers and bit good at relationships. Shortly before I graduate we break up and end contact. Not by my choice. I'm heartbroken.

Flash forward to college. After classes I'm on the bus home and talking with friends about life. I'm telling my story about the girl who got away. I finish my story and the bus comes to a stop. A girl walks in. Its HER. I tell my friends and immediately walk up to her. I say ""Crystal?!?!""

legaladvice,fdgodgs,t1_fdglijw,1578403924.0,"Depending on what exactly happened the punishments can be wide ranging.

If this was someone in line behind OP defrauding the pharmacy to steal the medication probably not much will happen. In this case the pharmacy would have filled the rx in good faith and (to the best of their knowledge) legally. Based on how OP was treated I'm doubtful this is the case.

If the rx was stolen by a tech or the pharmacist, fines, jail time, and lost licenses are all a possibility.

Those are the two scenarios I see as most likely what happened. It's also possibly that it was accidently given to another patient but based on the information needed to fill any rx let alone a control I doubt this.
