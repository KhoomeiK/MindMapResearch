gaming,ffihs9r,t1_ffi8e51,1579974185.0,Yeah it is one of those first ones. It has also been in there for two years. And is one of the first ps4s also. I'm running on borrowed time I think
gaming,ffi2ho7,t1_ffi1611,1579963152.0,But I should move it out of the cubby in our TV stand. It's big but not big enough I don't think. And no air flow
science,ffi2f8w,t1_ffhq4lq,1579963094.0,"I don't even have any kids, but there is that one commercial out where the guys daughter is leaving for college and it gets me every time in the feels. Makes me think about how hard that would be and what my parents went through."
dataisbeautiful,ffhn2lv,t1_ffgvxql,1579943260.0,Nice.
explainlikeimfive,ffhmbwn,t1_ffhm314,1579942135.0,Wow well written thanks
gaming,ffhlz66,t1_ffhfaup,1579941609.0,So is flat on wood better? Or is the gap better? I have mine sitting on two coasters. So not as much air underneath but I thought better than nothing.
explainlikeimfive,ffhltmv,t1_ffhlltm,1579941384.0,Ahhhh. That is what the x86 means and stuff. Interesting. Crazy someone came up with this shit. I still say aliens.
AskReddit,ffhljmb,t1_ffha2sm,1579940983.0,Is this the beta phase?
gifs,ffhlbun,t1_ffhf339,1579940671.0,Oh I dig
explainlikeimfive,ffhl8yo,t1_ffhkxcm,1579940553.0,That's always the part that gets me I think. Where does it start? How does it know this string of 1010101010 means to power this thing?
AskReddit,ffh8sge,t1_ffgfflv,1579926391.0,"I read this as, I'm not 100% gay."
AskReddit,ffh8kgx,t1_ffh4ysc,1579926201.0,"She was being rude and I don't think you were too sensitive about that, but then you kind of proved her point no?"
science,ffh7thy,t1_ffh37nn,1579925563.0,Our leaving the house entirely
books,fffbvn5,t1_ffejigi,1579880547.0,We already had words and people are too stupid to use them. So people are now making excuses to cater to them. Like everything else in the world. Got it.
dataisbeautiful,fffbov0,t1_fff4lam,1579880426.0,I do like all those smells. Reminds me of a good job done. Lol how old am I?
news,ffehgq8,t1_ffefamp,1579848172.0,I mean I guess I was assuming they would add to their budget since they got the money and maybe they prove they could do it. But yeah nvm I have no faith in the gvmnt right now
books,ffeh9bg,t1_ffedqxz,1579847939.0,"But if you could care less, it doesn't mean anything. You could care a lot or a tiny bit. It doesn't mean what people are using it to mean. Almost like how literally doesn't even mean literally anymore because people can't use it right. I get the evolution thing. But these words are common use words. Care. Could. Could not. Less. This example doesn't make sense. Does axe now mean ask because people can't pronounce it right? And if people say it is an idiom. No it isn't. Couldn't care less might be? But could care less would be the incorrect version of it. It's ok. People mess up idioms all the time. But people are stuck on getting this one wrong."
todayilearned,ffeae51,t1_ffe9ydy,1579841180.0,And you have joined in my fattest comment. Welcome! No judging here.
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ffeab7a,t3_et367d,1579841110.0,"Hey, I went with Sabine instead of Ezra. Get off my back."
books,ffea2m6,t1_ffe9ox2,1579840901.0,But it's fucking wrong. Just say couldn't! If you aren't saying couldn't then I assume you don't know that it is wrong. You are saying opposite of what you want to mean. Sure language can evolve. But every word in that sentence still means the same thing.
