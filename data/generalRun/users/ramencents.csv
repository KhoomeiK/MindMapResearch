But why are you so mad, trump will probably be acquitted along partisan lines.  it will be fun however watching republican senators explain why they let him off the hook as trump escalates his crazy behavior and makes the senate look like fools.

Thus when the addict gives up his vice, he then trades one addiction for another.  if the new addiction is running (or sometimes religion) then thats a happy trade any day of the week.  although sometimes i have to remind loved ones of recovering addicts that while its annoying to hear them always talk about their new interests, its way better than dealing with the past vice."

DeadBedrooms,fel70ge,t3_emskmg,1579215419.0,"based on your wife's post, it could be a while before you get that sexual passion again.  in the meantime ease up on the pressure.  stop being stingy and take her out somewhere.  you can take her to chilis or something.  rub her shoulders or feet if she wants.  see if she can perform other sex acts (bjs handjobs).  i dont think she is trying to frustrate you.  but you 2 could benefit from other activities to ease the burden on her vag.  good luck bro."
DeadBedrooms,fel6iix,t3_epe3wf,1579215111.0,"get a babysitter and go out together.  if you are concerned about him getting off, learn to develop a plan B for sex (handjobs bjs etc) until you are ready for sex.  he has to understand that sex for you, especially right now, is challenging.  you have to find a way to meet him half way with a plan B for his pleasure.  also why does he raise objections to spending money on dates?  stingy?  dates dont have to be expensive.  you could also ask him for a back rub or foot rub and he can get plan b.  its not the end of the world (yet) and hopefully both of you still have good will towards each other."

DeadBedrooms,fel47n4,t3_epknip,1579213701.0,"i would be honest and tell him what you say here.  you guys already seem open and honest with each other.  remember he was open about his dissatisfaction.  if he gets mad just remind him that he was honest with you already and that you really cherish your openness with him.  open relationships are super risky unless both parties are onboard.  sex workers are super risky, unless you get only hand jobs or wear a full on latex underwear with dick sheeth.  as far as exercise goes, maybe he can set a daily minimum goal of a brisk 30 minute walk 5-6 times a week.  5-6 thousand calories a day is binge eating.  maybe he can start substituting snacks with fruits and vegetables.  at the end of the day, losing weight is on him.  hopefully he wants to save his life before he develops chronic diseases.  if he doesnt want to change you have to be prepared to accept it or make your own changes, whatever that might be.  good luck."

politics,fekvlqd,t3_epd4aj,1579208514.0,"trumpers dont care.  they are too invested in him personally.  stating truth and facts about trumps criminality triggers them hard.  parnas is trying to save his skin so lets take what he says with a grain of salt.  however, so far most of what he has said is backed up by hard evidence.  im not so sure trump skates through the senate trial.  there is a chance that he might get removed as the senators try to protect their skin.  watching this administration is like watching a ship sink and the rats are jumping off.  hopefully he is removed and leaves peacefully, because i doubt an impeached president will get re-elected."

MGTOW,fekt5il,t1_fehzzc0,1579207069.0,"trump is not mgtow bro.  he has 2 ex wives and currently married to a former model.  also he isnt a conservative if that means anything to you.  yeah i get that he's appointing conservative judges and gives 2nd amendment and christian shout outs from time to time, but there is more to political conservatism than that.  the deficit is exploding, we still have a ton of import taxes that he implemented, and he's sending more troops to fight foreign wars.  he also surrounds himself with criminals and grifters.  birds of a feather, time will tell.

What you are advocating is super risky.  BTW these poor ladies have relatives.  Lots of relatives.  Some of their relatives might be criminals.  Not some college kid with a bag of weed, but real deal criminals.  No, no no.  Bad idea.  ""white guys are walking dollar signs"" that is true.  Dont think for a second everyone around knows what you are up if you try this.  pump and dump in a third world country at your won risk.  just beware you could get robbed or worse."
