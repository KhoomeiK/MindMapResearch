Knowing many people aren’t playing as frequently, I’ve been holding on to some friends assuming they’ll be back in a bit, but if they are not coming back, while it will be sad to see many of the (former) daily wing gifters go, it would be nice to know sooner than later. Just a thought 😉."
cats,fej57h0,t3_ep2ig2,1579157369.0,Thank you for your service! And for the cute cat picture!
dogs,fej4kkj,t3_ep5jpm,1579156661.0,"I can’t add anything else to the loads of thoughtful comments, but just want to say I feel for you in your heartbreaking situation. Don’t second guess your decision, have peace with it doing the best you can in Emily’s last hours."
dogs,fej3qvs,t1_feijlrn,1579155777.0,So sorry to hear what you and Kai went through. Just heartbreaking.
dogs,fej35th,t1_feiagkf,1579155151.0,"So sorry to hear of your situation. I agree with the others, it doesn’t sound like it’s Wyatt’s time yet. Perhaps there’s a kid in the neighborhood that could help your mom with his care while you and your dad are out?"
BTSWorld,feae68k,t1_fe6npe5,1578947519.0,"I’m with you, I do that all the time. 🙄"
Kombucha,fe8u71l,t1_fe6gtf2,1578930944.0,Great! Thank you so much!
Kombucha,fe6f5of,t1_fe0fx4s,1578889059.0,Thank you for the KombuchaChemistry pH strip suggestion. The ones I found on Amazon only have 0.5 intervals. Is that good enough? That was one of the concerns I had with the strips I have. They have a 0.4 interval and I didn’t think that was precise enough. Maybe what I have is good enough as it is?
Kombucha,fe6en4o,t1_fe1ub8q,1578888635.0,Thank you for the recommendation!
Kombucha,fe0es51,t3_emnxmw,1578812102.0,"I do and have for a little while now, but just today am starting my first 2F."
Kombucha,fe0dd0w,t3_eni7y1,1578810693.0,"Thank you for asking these questions. I’m fairly new too, and came here just now to ask about a good pH tester. I’ve been using strips so far, but they don’t seem to be very accurate."
bangtan,fdsr6rq,t1_fdrl6er,1578706886.0,"I’m confident that my grandma, who if she were still alive would be turning 100 this year, would love those Bangtan boys."
BTSWorld,fdbo86b,t1_fda34sj,1578259411.0,Hoping for a good roll call for you!
BTSWorld,fd9u2lf,t1_fd91mwe,1578238006.0,"I was stuck on 10-9 for the longest time and just passed yesterday by getting a RM passion 400 roll call and choosing WW RM with my selector. Now stuck on 10-16 tilll I get another good roll call or high stat 5*, but I guess I’ve got some time to do that anyway because I just realized that chapter 11 requires player level 50, and I’m still a ways away 😕."
BTSWorld,fd4ie1p,t1_fcvcm6d,1578167779.0,"I got Dreamland Jungkook for my New Years draw card, too! My first 5* for him other than the crafted one😁."
BTSWorld,fcn9xfb,t1_fcmuqxm,1577807000.0,So right!!
BTSWorld,fc4l2hv,t1_fc2a2bi,1577419820.0,"That’s ok, don’t feel bad. It’s not race to reach the finish line first. College (or any schooling) is so much more important. Best of luck to you with your studies next term!"
BTSWorld,fbkct3q,t1_fbf1lmh,1576948336.0,Same. Just was wondering the same thing.
