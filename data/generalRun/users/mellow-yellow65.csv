90dayfianceuncensored,fe9w8tw,t3_enxu5u,1578941991.0,Of course not. She is so entitled she thinks she's above the law. I hope there is a Connecticut officer who watches the show & starts following her for the easy seatbelt ticket.

Consider a different shade of pink. Maybe a size larger so we don't have to suffer watching those boobies hanging about! Ohhhh, I figured out why the knot, the boobs were falling, now they are safely tucked in the shirt!"

90DayFiance,fe9r052,t1_fe9h86g,1578940730.0,"Well now that I learned alot about this immigration k-1 Visa, it appears if you leave before the 90 days it appears as if you don't want to abide by USA laws, therefore they will not allow you to return.  It was on IG, they had a former immigration person giving input on why Michael got denied, what happens if Mursel goes back to Turkey. That was the first I got. 

So they are better off staying with a horror show like Tania, getting his crap together & then finding a wonderful kind flower child that is as layed back as he is."
90DayFiance,fe9q8hy,t1_fe94ekw,1578940481.0,My husband would never tolerate that. He'd leave me. Tania has no clue that in a relationship one cannot be in full control. Its giving 100% of yourself & recieving 100% from your partner. She is a soul crusher. She will always end up alone as longer as her armpit smelling self does not change. I am dreaming of the day she gets pulled over for not wearing a seat belt!
90DayFiance,fe9pa79,t1_fe91a2n,1578940275.0,"Wow, she actually has the witch doctor power to deactivate what is to be a very nice & great stone in to rubble. Takes all its power away. Her negative narcissistic self would beam any positivity from any stone."
90DayFiance,fe9oqcl,t3_eo5ph4,1578940080.0,I am curious to know what her boys thought of this ridiculous cry fest.
90DayFiance,fe9ok95,t1_fe8y6dy,1578940018.0,Ohhhh that's aggravating!  😡😡😡
90DayFiance,fe9oaa9,t3_eo5ph4,1578939915.0,I give this a standing ovation.  I had to mute it & grab a beer before I threw my shoe & broke my TV. Not worth breaking my TV!!  They utterly disgust me. She does not consider her boys at all chasing this weak man child. Ugh
realhousewives,fe9mxro,t3_eo51f4,1578939559.0,"I'd rather watch her then the 3 witches of the OC.  I mean if they bring Vicki back after her outrageous antics yelling how it's her show, telling Braunwyn to get off her show doesn't get her fired, she will be even pushier with her self righteous self & really think she is not only the OG of the OC, but she will feel like her threats worked & she will be more demanding & outrageous.  I seriously don't understand any of the men that date Vicki & Shannon with those screeches & bad behavior.  Seriously don't understand how Eddie is ok with Tamra getting naked & filthy drunk. I mean how do you look his parents in the eye? I mean no self respect.  I'm no prude & I can see if it happens a couple of times, but Tamra is so self absorbed in her looks she takes any opportunity to get naked. She's a bully. I think Braunwyn deserves a season 2 because we can see if she can bring more to the show, AND to my glee would piss off Vicki soooo bad!"
AskReddit,fdigb2d,t3_cttf20,1578442251.0,"Well I'm not proud of this but I was in my twenties working at a company small company you know less than 15 employees and the office manager would drive you crazy with her mood swings.  She was the type of you got on her crap list she would flip her middle finger when you walked by. Ya, she was a gem.

Anyway, I had enough of her. She was making my last day working there hell. So, myself & 5 others used to have lunch at noon. We had a couch, conference room table & kitchen. So we watched our soap operas. I was making lunch complaining with the others, so when I was washing my dishes a plan formed in my head.

I opened the silverware drawer & licked 10 of each utensils. About 45ish total. We did not like the 1:00 o'clock brown noses snitches so they were all gonna pay!!

Well the rest of the day went wonderfully even though she was trying to push my buttons I changed up & smiled at her. Ahhh, the sweet revenge knowing they would be eating off the silverware I licked!  Now I'm a grown up, but I never forgot that & would never do that again. No matter how angry I get. I work at a lovely company near my home & have been there for 29 years."

90dayfianceuncensored,fdg42v1,t1_fdexcy0,1578379234.0,"Everyone makes mistakes.  Annie is good for him & helped him become a better person. Sure his kids were upset, they now embrace Annie & watching him grow from a druken man, he's so chill. Also, he has a job teaching kids English. I think their YouTube is growing so I'm sure there is income there.  The guy paid his dues. If Jesus washings away our sins, shouldn't you all forgive the past & see how wonderful they are doing. 

Watching their story unfold shows that they both have become better people. So I'll be waiting for my down arrow.  Have a lovely even to you all."

depression,fcl1qoo,t1_fcjnrj1,1577737918.0,"I know exactly how you feel. Some dats I'm just so tired I don't know what to do. But recently posting here has given me some comfort knowing I'm not alone.   I'm so sorry you feel so low.   It may not matter but I will tell you what has kept me going. Beside the obvious of my husband and my little dog I'm also very Bible oriented. So when I start to not appreciate the life I have I think about our creator and then I read his word and his promises of a better future. I don't know if this will help you or if you care what is my way up sending you some love and letting you know that I care. I care about you enough to say please fight. Fight with me because I fight the same feelings and we can fight together with anyone and everyone else on this thread that will support you that will support me and we will support them. It's important to know that people care. You have to best friends that's more than I have. 

My best friend betrayed me and my other best friend couldn't be bothered with my illness. I struggle for me botch surgery so I have severe nerve damage and I almost died at during the surgery.

 My mother gave me up to my grandparents when I was born and when I found out later when my grandmother died that she was my biological mother not my sister I started a relationship with her.  As it turns out she's embarrassed of me because she had me at 16 and she's embarrassed of my biological father. So I spent most of my twenties and thirties being a joke in the family.   3 years ago I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt because I felt if my own mother can't love me how can anyone else? But this is an on going circle with being bi polar and severely depressed. Have come to a good place when it comes to her and I put her behind me and wish for the best regardless of the things she says about me.   If you have a loving mother don't break her heart. That's another thing that stops me is I have 2 children and some grandchildren and I don't want my legacy to be my life taken by my own hand. I'm not gonna lie it has been hard and I was hospitalized 3 times this year. But coming here writing my story sharing it with you and others make me feel normal. Today has been a difficult day and I can't seem to get outta bed. But reading your story and your feelings pushed me to make sure I don't just read it and just go back to sleep but that I become proactive and tell you that you matter and please fight.  You matter. Ask your 2 best friends how they feel about you and why. Ask your mother why she loves you & what are your good qualities.   Sometimes we're surprised by what are her friends and family would say. More importantly if you believe in God believe that he does love you. Read Isaiah 41:10 and 13.  It is my go to scripture. I'm sending you love and prayers and hoping you will find the strength you need to go on in find value in yourself. I don't know you but I know I love you because you're matter."

depression,fcisg58,t3_eh9up7,1577668727.0,"I'm so sorry how you are feeling.  Your not alone.  I feel like this alot of times,  not just holidays.  But like you I think of the people I would hurt by doing this.  I have been 5150 in the hospital 3x this year. But I made a vision board. The last couple of days I've managed to look at it, my goals, my wants & try say everyday,  God loves me, he knows my suffering & one day he will take away all the sickness in the world. All the badness. So I am trying a little bit harder. I know I will have weak days when I feel like I'm over this stupid life of mine. But I'm going to try & live for not only my family, not only to not disappoint God & hurt him but for me. 

Please don't hurt your self. Call the suicide hotline & spill your guts. I have called a lot this year & I find it therapeutic to spill my guts out. I am suppose to journal but is to hard for now, but we all just remember to take baby steps. You can do it! I know your pain. 

Keep writing on reddit,  I did it the first time & got some helpful comments.  Do you have a pet?  I do. Are you married? I am. My spouse helps by offering to paint or color.  We went to the beach one day & collected some cool rocks & painted them. I thought it was a crazy idea, but it was fun & took my mind off my sadness.

I'll be looking for your post & saying a prayer for you & all the people suffering from depression.  May 2020 make us stronger & may we on reddit be there to help our fellow sufferers. 

Hugs❤"

90dayfianceuncensored,fc6frt9,t1_fc68ayr,1577479533.0,"Absolutely.  I took some time & looked at her IG & she definitely travels A LOT.  It's like you said, she is afraid of her mom as she is demeaning, so she lives like a gypsy in search of this ""natural"" mother earth to define her. But she just picks up this co-dependant on others that she will be dependent on those around, Costa Rica really showed her true self. You can't edit how she handled her situation with a man who loves her, but rather then be dependent on Syngin, as her life partner, a love that requires nurturing she flees to strangers in fricken other countries & gets her ego stroked but with enough time to have them agree with her & then she leaves.  Her friends at home, I'm curious to know what they truly think of Tania & if they would ever do that to their significant other.  I truly feel sorry for her but she is infuriating! I feel worse for Syngin.  A cool guy! A sweetheart & she leaves him with her crazy unwelcoming mother! No, she is unbelievable! Ugh! 🤦‍♀️"
