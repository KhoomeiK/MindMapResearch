CPTSD,fff86z0,t1_ffedr6q,1579878137.0,"Hahahaha, I enjoy this scale!

Rabbits are hard to place on it though, tbh, because they're pretty different than the usual animal care we think of.  If you know what to do and have your home (or at least a space in your home) properly set up for them they're not that hard, just not low maintenance, lol.  Honestly they're kind of a combination of energetic dog and cat...additional maintenance due to length of hair depending on the breed :p.

Need their litter boxes and cages/pens/enclosures cleaned, nails trimmed, occasional grooming (more frequent for longer haired breeds), for optimum health their diet should include 3 different types of food daily (pellets, hay, fresh produce), they need exercise and lots of attention and social interaction, and whatever area you allow them in needs to be properly bunny proofed.  Oh, and they absolutely MUST be spayed/neutered.  That's it in a nutshell but it's a little bit more 
complex than that, lol.

Edit: Oh, and as an added bonus, like a lot of animals they spray pee to mark their territory.  Male bunnies will do it to females they wanna mate with.  Sometimes bunnies do it to the humans they love.  My boy got into bed last night while I was sleeping and did it to me, lmao!!!  But weirdly it's hard to be mad knowing he did it because he loves me and feels I belong to him, haha.  My fault for leaving the ramp to my bed up overnight XD"

She got a little upset when called out on the silliness of that (I mean...isn't that just the definition of a healthy relationship O\_o).  Went on to talk about how she initially thought it was weird too when her boyfriend told her things but as he kept telling her about it she figured it must be real.  Basically homeboy was being a tool and she was drinking the koolaid.  The whole thing was just so cringe."
CPTSD,ffe9ghv,t1_ffe8fpl,1579840376.0,"First of all you're fucking amazing.  I'm sorry if I sounded like I thought otherwise.  To take him in, spend the money to have him neutered (which as you saw is an absolute must) and give him a better life than he had before.  And to keep him 6 years until the end of his life despite the trouble he caused.  Truly, you're a good person and I think what you did for him was incredible.

I think you're probably right as to why he was the way he was.  They really don't do well when kept in small cages full time and they *need* socialization and interaction.  They can actually get depressed if left alone with no attention.  So yeah, he unfortunately probably got it pretty ingrained into him that life with humans just wasn't a good thing and didn't have it in him to bond.  But the fact that he ran around and did binkies was a good indication that he was happy there with you.  He may not have really known how to show you his appreciation, but I'm sure he felt it and he knew his life was better in the home you gave him.  A depressed, angry bunny ain't doin' no binkies :p"

I'm really glad it impacted how you see rabbits.  I'm an avid animal lovers, not counting my own pets I've been working with animals for over 20 years, since I was a teenager.  I've worked an incredible variety of them and have had so many great experiences.  But man, I can't believe I went 37 years without realizing how amazing bunnies are.  Taking in this little guy when his family wanted to unload him has straight up changed my life, as overdramatic as that might sound.  I think I needed him more than he needed me.  I was mind blown to learn all that I did, everything I typed about in those 2 posts (and then some).  They're sooooo misunderstood and underrated.

If all this typing has impacted even just one person, changed just the way just one person sees them, I'm fucking thrilled, lol.  I'm working on turning everyone in my life into bunny lovers, whether they like it or not, lmao XD

Rabbits,ffe8k49,t1_ffe1vy9,1579839637.0,"Absolutely!  Their calm, quiet nature just relaxes the hell out of me.  My boy is a lionhead and his fur is so soft and fairly fluffy and petting him is pretty much the best thing ever, haha.

I have 4 cats currently whom I love and I looooooove dogs.  Just 2 months ago I had to have my 15yo boy put down and it killed me...he's actually literally why I survived my particular trauma.  He was and always will be the love of my life.  But man, you're not wrong, bunnies are so different.  There's something just so soothing about them that I've never experienced with another animal.  Zen really is a great way to describe it."
Rabbits,ffe8bj2,t1_ffdfvkw,1579839443.0,"Oh for sure, 100% what you're friend said.  They're so, so very much worth the effort but they're really very delicate critters and you need to know how to care for them properly.  They're not really hard to take care of, per se, but they're far from low maintenance and can run into a lot of health and behavioral problems if their needs aren't properly met.

The biggest piece of advice I can give you though for when you do feel ready, is adopt from a rescue.  Bunny and small animal rescues DO exist.  They have all the animals they take in spayed/neutered and vetted before listing them for adoption and spend time getting to know their personality to better inform potential adopters.  You might be able to get a bunny cheaper from a breeder or farm or whatnot, but they absolutely MUST be spayed/neutered and it usually costs a lot more than for a dog or cat.  You'll save money, time, and frustration paying an adoption fee and getting yourself a vetted bunny.  And that fee typically goes right back into the rescue to help more bunnies in need."
CPTSD,ffe7vnz,t1_ffdzal1,1579839086.0,"I'm so glad he's ok!!!  And that you had the compassion and the means to have him treated.  So many people don't think small animals like bunnies are worth that...but imo any life is worth saving if you're able to.

And I agree whole heartedly.  My bunny snuggles at the end of the day are worth the occasional pee in my bed.  My 2yo daughter actually picks up the occasional stray poop and throws it in her diaper pail, lmao!!!  I just wish she could reach the faucet to wash her hands >_>."
CPTSD,ffe7ozt,t1_ffdjr31,1579838936.0,"As I began reading my first thought was ""Doesn't sound like he was neutered"", lol, and then continued to where you mentioned that.

You're 100% correct though, which is why I did say at the end that if any of what I said makes you interested in having a bunny in your life to please research first and understand that they are not low maintenance.  And I covered most of what you said in another post I made that linked to at the end of mine.  Not being an ass, just mentioning in case you didn't read it all (it was long, I know) and thought I was giving people false impressions and blindly encouraging getting one.

Much of what you said is precisely why adopting a rabbit from a rescue  or a shelter is the way to go.  The reputable ones won't adopt out a bunny that hasn't been spayed/neutered and they'll do it to make a bunny adoptable.  And adoption fees are typically wwaayyy less than the cost of buying a baby from a breeder or a store and then having to vet them yourself.

But yeah, honestly, I'll readily admit I lucked out and hit the bunny jackpot.  I took mine in from an acquaintance looking to unload him and I didn't have much time to contemplate the decision.  So this little guy that I really didn't know well, that I didn't hand raise or pick from a group after getting to know them turned out to be just about the best damn bun you could ask for.  You're right, they typically do chew on cables like crazy, but my guy doesn't.  Seriously, not ever.  We're gamers and computer nerds in my house, we have lots of cords around lol...he's never touched a one.  He prefers playing with my 2yo daughter's toys, hahaha.

My guy has successfully been integrated into full blown house bunny status.  He doesn't chew on things he shouldn't, he gets along with my cats, he's unphased by my child and her shenanigans, he typically comes when I call him and likes to hang out in whatever room the people are in...more specifically usually whatever room I'm in, lol.  His only flaw is that he occassionally pees on my bed and the couch, hahaha.  But honestly, he's so great that it's worth the trouble to have to clean those messes up, lol.  Otherwise he has great litterbox manners.

A lot of companion bunnies do have the potential to be part of the family like this, but you're right, sometimes you may find one who will just never be what you're looking for.  But, idk, for me that's ok.  They didn't ask to be brought into my home, they didn't ask to be bred, and I'll do my best to learn to co-habitate with them while giving them the space they need and just hope in time that they come around."
Rabbits,ffd8gio,t1_ffcx7q0,1579815461.0,"Kind of a crazy revelation, isn't it?!  But also so obvious when you think about it, hahaha.  They may not be the flashiest or most majestic critters out there, but I'm pretty sure bunnies are my spirit animal XD"

CPTSD,ffd7nve,t1_ffd0gkg,1579815011.0,">Also, gotta say, I love that their litterboxes don't smell like cats' do.

Lmao, right?!  Their pee can be pretty stinky, but yeah, they've got nothing on cats!  Pretty sure my boy's been trying to mark his territory anywhere he smells my cats >\_>.

Hahaha, been looking forward to telling my boyfriend about this little revelation (he's out of town for work training and tied up all day).

And that's sooooooo great that you were there to take them in!!!  They are so misunderstood and so often shafted by people not realizing what goes into properly caring for them.  I'm really, truly glad they both found someone with the patience and kindness to help them through their problems.

To be honest I've only had my boy Boomer for a little over month, and though I'm already dying to adopt another, lol, I know I should wait.  The more I learn as I go along with him the more I keep changing and adapting things around the house to make it better suited to him.  He's a free range house bunny except for over night or if I'm not home, but I think I lucked out in how mellow he is and how quick he was to adapt.  Aside from peeing on the sofa and my bed, lmao, he's incredibly well behaved.  I took him on pretty short notice when an acquaintance of mine was looking to unload him as their child lost interest and they decided to get a puppy >\_>.  Knowing all that I do now I wanna make sure I've got things really properly set up and prepared before introducing another one to the mix.  And I've got a 2yo daughter and I babysit a 4yo boy full time from home so I've gotta make sure whomever I bring home next can handle kids (who know the rules I've set for bunny interaction and are supervised closely when with him, lol).

When I was in my mid 20s my 2 best friends surprised me with a guinea pig on my birthday.  I had NO supplies or housing and they showed up at my place with her with nothing but a little bag of hay.  I had to put her in one of those plastic storage totes overnight (they didn't come over until late in the evening)...lid off of course, large enough that she couldn't get out of it.  Went out the next day to get supplies for her (gotta love a gift that costs you money, hahaha), got her all set up...and she died within days :(.  I felt terriibbllee, and to this day I don't know how she died, it happened over night while she was secure in her cage.

Silver lining, I contacted the pet store (yeah, they got her from a pet store) and told them what had happened.  They gave me store credit which I put towards a young ferret, and man she was the freaking best.  She lived a little over 10 long years and was the funniest little girl.

Neither of them have ever hurt each other and have always been closely monitored.  He typically sticks to hanging out in whatever room I'm currently in.

If you ever have any questions feel free to ask!  I'm admittedly far from an expert but animals in general are my life, been making a living working with them on and off for 20+ years.  And can point ya in the direction of some very knowledgeable folks!  Especially since you have a child I'd really recommend getting an adult rather than a baby, adorable though they are.  If you work with a rescue you'll get to meet and spend time with the buns they have available to find the right fit and they always have them spayed/neutered prior to adoption.  Adoption fees typically cost a lot less than having to get them fixed yourself and rescue folks are passionate about what they do so they make themselves pretty available to answer questions and offer advice.

It's super good to hear about people who do.

I've actually got a 2yo daughter, a 10yo stepdaughter, and I babysit a 4yo boy full time.  So kids and bunnies are do-able, but you're absolutely right, it's on the parents.  It took constant supervision and instruction when he was ""new and interesting"".  Major ground rules drilled in repeatedly, the biggest being NO ONE picks him up but me EVER (which even that is only when necessary).  Now he's fully integrated into free roaming house bunny status (though enclosed over night or if I'm not home/available to be aware).  He was also a neutered adult though when I took him in...lordy I pity the baby subjected to kids ><.

Tbh I got my little guy because of a family who got him for their kid because she wanted one and the kid lost interest and the parents didn't want to take responsibility, just like you pointed out.  He was living a sad, lonely life with maybe 10 minutes of attention a day and never leaving his cage.  When I met him in their home he didn't want to leave his cage though he clearly wanted to be pet.  Fed horribly too.  But now he quite dislikes being in his cage, hahaha.  He knows the morning routine; when he sees me get up he uses his litter box and waits at his door for me to open it, lol.  Typically snoozes in whatever room I'm in between some good zoomy sessions, haha.  Happily comes out to say hi to the kids and is actually pretty fond of the 4yo!  Jumps on the sofa and has a ramp to get into my bed.  He seriously brightens my day, every day.

Parenting,ff33gv7,t3_er8hoo,1579532706.0,"I feel you :(.  I had every intention of breast feeding but just didn't produce.  I have PCOS and apparently that's a pretty common thing with it.  I pumped every hour or two and some days maybe produce an ounce.  She wasn't much for latching either, but that may have been from the little to no output.

My daughter's almost 2 1/2 now, our bottle days are behind us and she's a beautiful, healthy, intelligent, and vibrant little girl.  My god she's speaking in full sentences and full on having tiny conversations with me o_O.  And she does somersaults like a champ!  She knows all her letters, can *mostly* say the alphabet, and count to 12 (most of the time, haha). She's great, her development is fantastic I couldn't be happier with her.

And yet...I still feel some nagging guilt.  Anytime I hear or see something about how much better breastmilk is I feel a little ashamed, like I failed her :(."
Instagramreality,ff29agn,t1_ff232o1,1579497604.0,"Because it's an act, it's a photo op.  Sure, she may very well enjoy the aquarium and aquatic life...but the faces she's making, the movements, the poses...it's not because she's in awe of what's around her, it's because she wants dem likes and follows.

If this were about here being immersed in something she finds amazing she wouldn't have a photographer following her around that she's mugging for."
unpopularopinion,ff288tu,t1_ff1umfo,1579496673.0,"So where on the spectrum do I fall if I don't eat them, if I surround myself with them as much as possible, share my home with them (hell, a variety of species have peed in my bed over the years, lmao), work with them professionally, foster them when I can, volunteer at rescues, and the ones I've been closest to say take a piece of my soul with them when they leave this world? ><

My most recent passion is bunnies.  I took in a house bunny in need of a home and my god he's incredible.  I've been rearranging my home to better meet his needs and give him the best life possible.  Seriously, if you've never spent time with bunnies that like people you don't know what you're missing, hahaha."
unpopularopinion,ff27tah,t3_er1syq,1579496299.0,"**TLDR** You can be a socially competent and well adjusted person and still recognize animals for the beautiful souls that they are.  And can still prefer their company to most humans.  And if you've never been connected enough with an animal to know this then it's a real shame.

I think most animals are better than most people.  And I'm more comfortable showing affection to animals than to most people.  But I don't particularly feel like anyone hates me or blame anyone who does.

I have parents and a sister that I love and I know they love me.  I'm basically married (really, in ever sense other than making it legally recognized) and we have a beautiful daughter together who is the light of my life.  I've got a very small but tight knit and reliable circle of friends.  I'm fairly outgoing and pretty good with people, although a bit awkward with some social anciety.  I've never had a job interview that I didn't ace and I've worked jobs that relied heavily on working with the public.  And tomorrow I'm beginning volunteer work with an animal rescue.

And I think animals are the best fucking things in the world.  I'd take a night in at home with my bunny and my 4 cats over going out and something.  I lost my 15yo dog 2 months ago and it still hurts every day, he was a part of my very soul.  I bend over backwards to give my furry family member the best possible life I can and I've got a strong bond with all of them.

Most animals are incredibly emotionally intelligent, sensitive, and aware.  They absolutely feel affection, trust, and loyalty beyond ""feeding them"".  Though that certainly helps, haha.  My amazing, beautiful dog was a fuck ton better than the sociopathic monster of a human he literally saved my life from.  If you're not aware of the mindful, caring creatures most animals are I'm going to assume you've never truly been close to one, never really connected with one.

The kind of person you described in your post sounds like someone selfish and hateful.  But that's not the kind of person who opens themselves up to animals and knows how to connect with them.  You've gotta learn to let your walls down and really experience what animals, in all of their varied and lovely personalities, have to offer.

P.S. Hell, as I type this my best friend is messaging offering, unasked, to wake up early on a holiday to come help me.  She and my sister are ALWAYS there for me.  Yeah, no, I don't blame people for hating me.  I consider myself incredibly lucky and am grateful to have some amazing people in my life.  That doesn't mean I can't appreciate how amazing animals are too."

And I know this isn't smoking in general, but I love when I'm walking with my child and I have to lead her off the side walk to go out and around someone's gd smoke."

NotHowGirlsWork,fevwtkh,t1_fevdjix,1579402454.0,"Yeah imma just go live off the grid and raise my daughter to be a mountain woman with no access to the internet, TV, pop culture etc.  That's a feasible option and not at all an overreaction, right?"
UnsentLetters,fevwl3b,t3_eqh8fo,1579402357.0,"This just made me bawl ><.  Sounds like you have the same relationship I had with my boy.  I lost him in November, he would have been 15 in December.  He came into my life when he was about 12 weeks old.  His name was Griffin and he was a Newfoundland/Border Collie mix...and the dearest friend I'll ever know.

He saved my life as well.  He stopped me when I had a gun in my mouth and I knew I couldn't leave him.  He was the most beautiful soul I'll have ever have the privilege to encounter.  He was a part of me, he knew me better than anyone, and he got me through the hardest years of my life.  I truly wouldn't be here without him.  It was 2 months ago and it still hurts so fucking bad.  I'll never not miss him.  Some days I feel like I can't get through my shit without him.  My world will never, ever be the same without him."
