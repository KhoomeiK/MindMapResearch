DIY,ffj0c75,t1_ffiymdb,1579987183.0,"Without looking, we can only guess. But if a pump jammed or is wearing out, it might trip breakers due to using too much current. Faulty wiring or a bad breaker is also a possibility. Is it a regular breaker, GFCI, or AFCI? If a GFCI breaker is tripping, that could be an indication of water getting into a control box or other wiring junction. GFCIs can also have nuisance tripping from motor loads, possibly more likely also if it is wearing out. Same with AFCIs, but a tripping AFCI could also indicate a loose junction

You could always try replacing the breaker if you think that's a potential problem- they can wear out too. Be sure to use same type and amperage, turn the main breaker off while you have the cover off the panel for safety. 

If it is just a regular breaker, you could try to measure the current with a clamp ammeter before replacing the breaker- that would tell you if the current is excessive or if the breaker is bad. Only one wire through the clamp at a time (not the whole cable), otherwise it will read zero."

Also, I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think the landlord would have any basis to sue for turning a breaker off if you don't actually cause any damage. Do be aware though, turning off A/C in a humid area with a cool basement could lead to mold.

If noise is an issue, you could look into inverter generators- they're pretty quiet.
