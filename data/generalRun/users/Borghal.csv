I had a quick lok through the links and those prices refer to US stores and you non-US section is more often totally empty than not. Also when I click on a list of most popular games, the last thing I expect is a store-like interface with prices taking up more space than the ratings and names of the games.

Time and distance is unspecified, but it is probably safe to assume that they walked for at least some 4-5 hours to even get to a mountain from the Wall. Assuming Gendry manages no more than 4 hours to get back, this leaves 20 hours. It's about 1500 miles from the Wall to Dragonstone. A raven can manage about 50 mph, this already means that it will fly 30 hours. But let's say Westerosi ravens are superpowered and can fly twice as fast, so it gets to Dragonstone with some 5 hours to spare. For Dany to get to Jon in time, Drogon would have to fly at 300mph, so they would probably have to strap Dany to him and dress her really well to withstand 300mph winds for 5 hours.

You see that even with ridiculous concessions like 100mph ravens this scenario is silly and that's why I called it Deus Ex Machina - the only way Daenerys made it there in time is some serious magic."

The white walkers had no reason to give Jon's party a day off. At best you could say they waited for daybreak or nightfall...

* Sansa never married Ramsay
* Jorah did not contract greyscale
* Neither Jaime nor Dorne ever went to Dorne for Myrcella
* Arya did not meet Jaqen in the temple
* Doran Martell should have been plotting against Lannisters, not trying for peace. The whole Dorne plot was bungled up as a result of character cutting.
* Mace Tyrell is not Master of Coin
* Varys does not travel with Tyrion
* Jon wins the election by a HUGE margin, not barely.
* Barristan Selmy is not dead
* Cersei does not negotiate with the Iron Bank, refuses to pay anything
* Loras is not arrested, he goes to conquer Dragonstone and is mortally wounded there
* Myrcella was sent to Dorne by Tyrion
* Hizdahr isnt killed, he married Daenerys
* Daenerys is nto attacked in the Pit, instead Drogon is drawn to it by the smell of blood, and goes on a rampage which results in dozens of dead, and Tyrion does not reveal himself to Dany at that point for fear of Barristan, who is still alive
* Brienne is nowhere near the battle where Stannis dies
* Stannis isn't even dead yet (confirmed by GRRM)
* Jon is killed for deciding to confront Ramsey and aid Stannis, not just because of the wildlings

These aren't exactly blunders, but it seems to me they were changed not because it benefited the story, but maybe because they were worried people won't ""get it"", like the Asha/Yara vs Osha nonsense.

Just means that all people have the same rights, it does not mean we are all equally capable. I could become a politician today if I so chose, but until I convinced people I am capable enough to make the decisions, I would not be a successful one. And if I did but failed to back up my claims convincingly, I would not stay successful.

Besides there actually are qualifications in many countries for some important posts like president, senator, judge etc., and many are age-based, which (I presume) is based on the (correct or not) belief that with age comes experience/wisdom. That may not be a great criterion, but it proves my claim that a higher degree of aptitude not possessed by everyone is required. If special skill is required to cover a certain area of governing, then it is clear that the people on average could not perform that duty even if time was not a factor.

>Practicality is also the reason why Britain uses FPTP. Back in the old  days it was the simplest and thus most practical method of electing  representatives all over the country.

I feel like FPTP is just another remnant of the past the UK has failed to move on from. Simple doesn't mean good. It wasn't great then and it is even worse now, what with increased diversity in basically every aspect of human life. I know there are arguments on both sides of the fence (when are they ever not?), but the fact that FPTP plays into major parties and favors those in power staying in power together with its endgame of leading to a two-party system is enough of a reason in my eyes to label it as unequivocally bad. When voting for a party you agree with is considered a wasted vote becasue it isn't one of the two ""big ones"", you know the system is defunct. It is my opinion that the problems that come with plurality systems (such as small parties having more leverage than their votes should afford) are much lesser in comparison."
worldnews,ffdvpvf,t1_ffdrkq7,1579830106.0,"As for the non-voters, I disagree ""I dont know well enough to answer, so I will let everyone else decide and abstain"" is a legitimate stance because I think that once a referendum like this is called for, it is one's duty as a citizen with a voting right to inform oneself to the best of one's ability.

>I fundamentally disagree with this. Democracy does not derive its power from the people because they are qualified or informed. Democracy derives its power from the people because they are the people and their wish should be respected. The Ill-informed have the exact same right to vote as the informed based on the principles they choose. THAT is democracy. That's why it's a voting right

I suppose we'll have to end on that note, because indeed we disagree on how far people's voting rights ought to extend. I contend that people, as a whole, should not bear the responsibility of deciding firsthand nation-wide important matters, because people, by and large, don't care about things other than their immediate life, making them shortsighted and unsuited to decide the future of a whole nation. 

Pure democracy would never work practically due to how complicated it is to manage a country, but it doesn't even work in theory because the average person is not fit to make the decisions necessary. Thus, representative democracy, which is NOT the same thing as ""just"" democracy and certainly does not exist purely because of time concerns. Average people simply cannot perform many of the tasks required.

And so, I have the right to choose a representative whom I *trust* to be skilled and able to defend my interests. That's as far as my voting rights should extend, to protect me from my own lack of knowledge, foresight and/or skill. Trust is something any person is capable of."

""Remainers are young and stupid"" now don't go making it personal. Are you old? Sounds like you harbor some resentment there. As far as I'm aware people of all ages voted for both options... this argument is used as a strawman a lot. And the line about indoctrination makes you sound a bit tin-foil-hat, whereas the story about Farage and Johnson's Bus of lies has been over the world twice over. A lot of the remainers for sure also had no idea what they were voting for, but at least they weren't victims of a massive lie campaign and hypocrisy (Farage moving out of the UK and gettign EU citizenship after his party won, LOL).

>Even less didnt want a change.  Not-Voting is not a vote for remain. To make such assumption is anti-democratic by nature.

See, that's kind of where I disagree. This isn't like voting for people where you have many options and ""none of the above"" may be a valid response. Nor can you interpret not voting as ""this doesn't concern me"", because it does massively concern everybody.

It was a binary vote, and further to that, a vote of action vs non-action, so I see anyone who didn't care enough to vote as someone who didn't care enough to take action, thus choosing non-action.

Now I don't particularily care how it ended up, I'm not from the UK. I'm just making an observation that the bar for leaving seem to have been set very low considering how big of an issue it is and how misinformed and unqualified most of the voters are naturally going to be on something like this.

And all the people that seem so confident that Brexit should happen because they won the referendum are confusing to me, because that tiny margin of victory does not speak of a unified populace, rather it seems to hint that issues of misunderstanding each other won't go away with leaving the EU

On a semi-related note, my opinion on the referendum is that it never should have been a referendum in the first place, because it's way too complicated an issue for people to even understand, let alone form an informed opinion about. The very reason representative democracy exists is precisely because most voters don't understand shit and need experts to make decisions for them.

That being introducing the viewer to Aretuza/Ban Ard, explaining how the sorcerers and sorceresses were organized, showing a bit of politics and that the magicians were trying to pull the strings of all the nations. These things are sort of drip-fed in the books in a way that would be hard for TV to replicate, so doing it so visually is not a bad solution.

But Ciri? What was her story supposed to convey to the viewer?

* She accomplished nothing and nothing of consequence happened to her.
* They amplified her magic powers for no reason - originally she ran away from Cahir at night because he was the sole survivor of his unit and had to sleep eventually. There are scenes where they try to talk to each other but neither speaks the other's language.
* They butchered the Brokilon sequence down to it losing all meaning. It was in the show because ""Ciri was in Brokilon in the books"". But in the books, the first time this happens is earlier than in the show, she runs from an arranged marriage and Geralt finds her in Brokilon by happenstance and takes her back home, because he really wants nothing to do with her. But on the way, he grows kind of fond of her, making their eventual second meeting (which is depicted in the show as a first meeting) that much more impactful.
* Calanthe wasn't *evil* (and it that's what you walked away with, that's another failign of the show) nor was she as oafish as they showed her, she was just a pretty uncompromising monarch.

All the time they spent focusing on Ciri running around without either the plot or her character developing could have been better spent fleshing out other things or even including the other short stories  thatthey cut. The fact that Ciri had a hard time on the run could have been conveyed with a single montage and no need to make up an imaginary friend or spend so much time on something so inconsequential.

I honestly don't understand what was gained by changing Ciri's already pretty thin storyline so much that really only her starting and ending points remain. Why add the magic?

The Imperial guy will probably be the one who knows the game best (he *needs* to know all of his own rules, plus the Rebels') and so depending on the skill difference between players, the Imperial player can roflstomp the Rebels in such a way that it won't be fun anymore (spending your turn being stunned or moving only a space or two because units cleverly block your way), if he so chooses.

If you change too much / the wrong things, it stops being an adaptation and at best you're writing fan fiction, at worst it's not even recognizable anymore. And imo changing the things that the audience will expect strongly (the genre, the protagonist/antagonist, the plot, the setting , in that order) is a substantial change to the source. If you want to change the very things that make a story memorable, why bother adapting it in the first place?

E.g. They didn't change Sherlock or Watson much, did they? They just sort of re-imagined him in today's world. It still takes place in a big English city, it's still a crime drama, and the plotlines are sometimes even similar when taking into account the century of changes.

If you have a fictional character that is already well established in the minds of people, adapting him/her it's pretty much the same as a adapting a historical figure - people expect that this person looks a certain way.

In the case of Bond it's rather interesting since Bond isn't a character per se, it's a set of stereotypes.
