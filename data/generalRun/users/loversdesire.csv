nice to meet you, peace"
CollegeRant,ffeh9bb,t1_ffeh7r5,1579847939.0,i really hope things get better for you. everyone deserves to have a happy relationship if that’s what they want
CollegeRant,ffegrcx,t1_ffegp1j,1579847387.0,why would i accept you for who you are when you could be so much better? you could be so happy. why would you settle for less?

i wasn’t talking about you—other incels have attacked me. you’re surprising civil

but seriously don’t call yourself an incel if you don’t fit the mold. go ahead and google incel and see the shit that comes up—don’t align yourself with that toxicity"
CollegeRant,ffeg368,t1_ffefyn3,1579846653.0,"i have done my research. i’ve had incels attack me just for being a woman; i’m not wrong

just give therapy a try. go for literally one session and i guarantee you’ll be clamoring to go back. it helps so fucken much"
CollegeRant,ffef429,t1_ffe4jjb,1579845629.0,"that’s not true; your face is not the problem and i guarantee you don’t have the intelligence that therapists do when it comes to treatment

and incel is an ‘involuntary celibate’ who tends to play into harmful stereotypes about men and women and, for whatever reason, believes that something is wrong with him because he isn’t dripping with women. he also tends to expect sex, as if he is entitled to it, and has some pretty convoluted beliefs about society in general."
CollegeRant,ffe2l9y,t1_ffe2bwx,1579835059.0,"ok but seriously have you ever considered therapy? i don’t mean that as an insult. a good therapist will study the way of thinking that causes your pain and help you instill new behaviors to change those thought processes. 

are you a typical incel, then? the hate-all-women type?"

TwoXChromosomes,feyk9ig,t1_fex6uzc,1579446633.0,"ok, i agree. but this backlash is too strong. if i were op, i would be wildly upset right now, when i’d put myself out there and been in a vulnerable state of shifting my beliefs. 

you talk about empathy; now you have to practice it, too. i understand what goes on in the minds of pro-lifers. i do sympathize with them. all they see are little infants when a woman is pregnant, even when her fetus is just a bundle of cells. they care about those infants and the future they might have. i care about those infants too; that shared emotion brings us together.

our responsibility is to empathize with those around us and listen with open-mindedness so that, when we share our side of things, it takes a person one micro-step closer to embracing what we feel. 

as humans, we are all so similar. the beliefs we hold are just little applications of the values we share. if congress/senate tried to govern this way, with open-mindedness, empathy, and a focus on values, we would get SO MUCH done because there would be SO MUCH overlap! 

TL;DR i understand and agree with you all. however, i think it’s important not to add insult to injury. consider how op felt then and feels now. she’s not a monster for having once been pro-life, and if a risk of pregnancy is what changed her mind, well, good—because she changed her mind in the end. it’s not ideal, but it’s still a positive step."
college,fek4uqe,t1_fejxq0j,1579192642.0,"dig hard at your activities fair—there are always good clubs lurking around. if not a club, join an academic org."
college,fejxq0j,t3_epchz8,1579188243.0,"that sounds a lot like it could be social anxiety. you should consider seeing a therapist; a lot of universities offer free therapy for those who need it! see if yours does.

if you feel like therapy’s not for you (even though i highly recommend it, everyone has something to gain from it), start small. in your classes, sit next to the same group of people. chat before the professor begins lecture and after as well; crack jokes, talk about how he’d the homework was, etc. everyone can relate to that. pretty soon you’ll have a fully-fledged study group to text for help who will steadily become better friends with you. as your college years continue, your classes will become more specific to your major, and you’ll be able to gain friends within that major.

join organizations!!! this one is so important. it’s hands-down the best way to find friends. you like gaming? join the gaming club. enjoy theatre? theatre club. you get the gist. if you’re involved in an organization it almost grants you instant friends. 

good luck! and remember that everybody struggles with loneliness to some degree at college."
