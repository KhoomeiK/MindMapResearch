FortNiteBR,fg72uut,t1_fg675lx,1580582697.0,Who cares? People complain so much. It’s on YouTube. This is reddit. If the creator wanted they could post it here. The poster never said they made it.
FortNiteBR,fg72msy,t3_ex1qqs,1580582546.0,People whine too much about this being posted. They didn’t say it was theirs or claim they made it. Stop crying.
television,fg6tccs,t3_ex77rr,1580576406.0,Maybe they can keep the show moving in chronological order instead of completely confusing the viewers with this jumping around nonsense. The show is great but that is completely unnecessary.

ConanExiles,fg127w6,t1_fg0tl82,1580419408.0,yes. I found out through the admin. The armor is Chaos warrior. The weapons are Lusttaker swords with enchant from Xotli religion. It's part of the Exiled Lands improved mod.

BattleBreakers,ff6jj1e,t1_ff6hfvz,1579628547.0,"I am not disagreeing with you that Voldren is able to take advantage of POOR game design, NOT exploit.  There is no reason to change the hero, this can be fixed at the tower's defense parameters. But that's up to Epic, isn't it?

Your crusade to ""nerf hard"" and whine about downvotes like some martyred child doesn't mean there can't be sensible discussion about Epic having overlooked a mechanic. In the end, this will probably be resolved one way or another in the next hour or so.

Edit: well, there you go. The effect of hero ability was modified: Shieldsplitter now properly applies bonus damage based on the DEF of the target it hits, instead of based on the initial target. So maybe you're happy? maybe not? whatever. Have a good day!"
BattleBreakers,ff6i6fr,t1_ff6af8j,1579627728.0,This is a sensible approach. If you nerf the heroes individually then people waste the materials that were spent leveling them up and then the hero becomes useless. He's quite balanced beyond the tower problem. This issue can be resolved without punishing people for poor game design and overlooked mechanics (which apparently happened a couple times before).
Alisai,ff6gk86,t1_ff5q082,1579626731.0,"who doesn't want to be 55 years old and be able to afford a gold digger like this? she's stunning, but let's not pretend that if he was poor he could pull ass like this."

BattleBreakers,ff593iz,t1_ff4al1g,1579583922.0,it's not an exploit. it's poor game design.  you're not exploiting anything using these two characters the exact way they were designed to be used.

FORTnITE,fev1l80,t1_fenz3j6,1579392110.0,i played stw when it went live and immediately it started sucking. After wasting tons of money on llamas I got a complete refund for the game and all the money spent on llamas. BR will always get more attention and more support from Epic. Stw will eventually be cut just like Paragon was. It's a financial sinkhole and it's obvious they don't want to put any substantial resources into making the game better.

FORTnITE,feldb04,t3_eppvs4,1579219488.0,lol not likely. Epic isn’t putting that kind of effort into stw. This game mode is on the chopping block. They aren’t spending money like that for stw.
