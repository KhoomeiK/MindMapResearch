bipolar2,ffif8lr,t1_ffi25wv,1579972451.0,It’s definitely something that a happens a lot (passing bipolar to children) just remember it is not your fault. She has a supportive understanding parent to guide her and that is going to be worth SO MUCH to her.
Anxiety,ffif14f,t1_ffieboo,1579972309.0,Thank you for the reassurance :)
bipolar2,ffi4c4o,t3_etrq40,1579964708.0,"One thing I’ve found is that while there are many supportive people in the bipolar community, there are just as many invalidating assholes with the “I’m worse than you I know more” mentality."
bipolar2,ffi1qaf,t1_ffi1lh2,1579962476.0,That’s a very sweet thing for both of you to do. It’s probably really helping her accept mental illness as a disease and not have the “it’s just made up and in your head” mentality that unfortunately so many people have.
