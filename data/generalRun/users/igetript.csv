witcher,ffam10o,t1_ffaftmz,1579739102.0,Yo dark art anime would be great for this. I always thought that the gunslinger series would be great in a dark and gritty animated style

ChoosingBeggars,ff83v5f,t1_ff7ye50,1579665284.0,"This. Literally got into my first accident a couple months ago. It was 100% three other persons fault, so I was in a rental that was comparable to my vehicle, and all repairs, and rental cost were on USAA.

The repair cost were higher than what I paid for the vehicle."

Growing up in Vermont I never saw much of an ocean, and when I moved to the Caribbean at 26ish I was super uncomfortable in the open water.
