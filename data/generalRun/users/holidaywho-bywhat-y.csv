GraceAndFrankie,fgs0o3l,t3_ez4zmf,1581065555.0,There's the one where Grace and I think Mallory smoke Frankie's stash. And the whole episode around Frankie studying for her driver's license test high. Frankie and Brianna smoke a joint when Grace makes her online dating account. Those are in earlier seasons.  Grace and Robert have some edibles and talk sometime in season 6.
