I can’t say the same about myself. From about 21-26, I put myself through an intentionally hedonistic phase, to try and break out of my shell...and it got really crazy. I did some stupid shit.

I wish I had some advice for you, but I’m not really the best source for it. The only thing I’d say is, don’t worry about changing who you are...Because I did, and it only made things worse. Just be a decent, responsible person, and stay true to yourself. That’s all."
