iamatotalpieceofshit,ffesk87,t1_fferoo5,1579863494.0,Yup. You can't trust those people. I always imagine myself in a car accident or a house fire needing assistance and nothing you do or say to them penetrates because 'doggo first' then you die watching them save a dog.
news,ffcf305,t1_ffbz0x6,1579798088.0,That's assuming the parents are even in the country. If they're not documented you're just guessing.

news,ffbhr26,t1_ffb9ypl,1579765860.0,How is labor not free to move within the borders of the country? You're obviously not suggesting free movement of labor across national borders given that the daily minimum wage in one country could approximate the monthly minimum wage in another.

It is acceptable for children to be homeless without parents you know or neglected, it's fairly common."

JoeRogan,ffb4q73,t1_ffb2f5r,1579751743.0,"It's happened before that presidents have lost the popular vote but won the college, why would I have a problem with that outcome? I certainly don't think Hillary would be a bad president."

JoeRogan,ffb20rn,t1_ffb0yny,1579749806.0,"Nobody used the word 'election.' The winning outcome is 'become the president', she failed to achieve that outcome so she didn't win. She may have won some meaningless totals like 'most dollars spent' or 'most time spent unconscious in a van' or 'most votes' but she didn't _win_."

Good comment. Truly visionary."
JoeRogan,ff8o5p1,t1_ff8mc6e,1579688433.0,That's a lot of bluster and aggression from someone confident in both their position and the girth of their penis.
JoeRogan,ff8kk3s,t1_ff8hf4q,1579682917.0,In my opinion misread and misinterpret are colloquially synonymous. I don't think I'm too alone in having that opinion. It's common to say one 'misread the tone of an article' for example.
Showerthoughts,ff8kerf,t1_ff8i65y,1579682697.0,"Yeah things improve. You can kinda take a guess at what's changed (for any product, not just batteries) based on the scale of the improvements. A small improvement usually means the case is a bit thinner, the contents packed a bit tighter, an existing recipe tweaked. A big step (25%+) change usually means a complete reworking of some type."
