DebateReligion,ffewng3,t1_ffdcf1e,1579868575.0,"well that's getting to the old 'can god make something so big even he can't move it' type of debate, which I don't find very productive. My point is that you can't have freedom of thought while also lacking the capacity to think about dichotomies; aka the 'can't feel happy without pain' type of thing.

Those next few questions are actually pretty interesting, especially considering all the different interpretations of god. For fun, using my personal interpretation of god, I would guess; Essentially yes, god is kinda like 'perfect thought', and creation comes from god 'thinking' perfectly (the philosophy behind the flower of life pattern). but it's also possible that god is essentially unable to, simply because it's a 'slave' to truth, like a computer, not truly in control. Is god happy? No I don't think so, but I think it can be happy at times. I think god is the culmination of experience itself, which isn't exactly 'happy'. For the last two, if I assume the OT creation myth was true, I would think that the fall is a story about the evolution of awareness in humans. As in, the fall of man doesn't have to do with 'thoughts' as much as an expanded self awareness and our unique hands giving us an insane capacity to understand and manipulate physical reality (animals have thoughts and feelings so are not in a constant state of 'happiness' either). So I'd say no, adam and eve couldn't control it anymore than other animals (tho there IS some level of control there), being 'beast like' in mind, and were not 'happy' either (animals seem to live in the moment more than humans do, so they're happier overall. they think less about the 'void' than we do and are more apt to accept and exist contentedly than humans. animals also live by natural game laws rather than fret over absolute truths, but our increased mental capacity leads us to deal with those absolute truths constantly. eg; a turtle doesn't care if it's on a flat disk or a globe, but some humans care a LOT about the topic even if the truth doesn't change their life one bit. we're utterly obsessed with how our unique power should be used, which makes sense, even really old tech is downright magical and we make and improve stuff constantly)

I think you're missing my deeper point. To create free thinking beings, you must allow them to create false beliefs, otherwise they would only be able to create true beliefs (which means they have to also have perfect logic and access to all knowledge). Our suffering comes from false beliefs. A sentient being has a subjective experience, meaning they are inherently limited in their understanding of Reality. This means we create false beliefs in order to act appropriately within our slice of reality. God existing isn't necessary for this to be the case, so I'm not saying 'it must be this way' aside from how logic and binary works. Computers are 'perfect thinkers' with limited knowledge, and only produce what they are programmed to produce. They are not 'free' because we 'force' them to 'think' in a specific way that is purely logical. Why is it mandatory that god create perfectly-logical-thinkers, in your mind? 

In my opinion, what we see is the result of god having created beings with free will who choose ""perfectly"", not ""good"". As in ""perfectly in line with gods will"", or ""correctly"", as in, the right choice for that individual at that time for any number of reasons. We're the ones making judgments about those choices, and those judgments are based on limited knowledge and a collection of false beliefs. We say ""Murder is evil"", but what we mean is ""killing is grossly irrational and harmful in certain contexts"". Our judgments of right and wrong are 100% dependent on our subjectivity and context. You say that god should be able to create free beings who only choose good, but what you MEAN is that you think god should make everyone behave the way YOU think they should. Perhaps we ARE only able to make ""good"" choices. Perhaps the 'fall of man' is actually about our refusal to accept god's view of ""good"". After all, they clothed their naked bodies, believing them to be shameful, 'bad', in spite of being created 'perfect' in the eyes of god.  

I don't know if god has free will. As I said, it may actually be a sort of slave to truth, like a computer. But if god is 'awareness itself', as I tend to believe, than yes, god has free will but chooses perfectly. It may not always choose ""good"", since that requires more knowledge than is available and a judgment. Essentially, I think god makes Truth by always making perfect choices, so it's more like you get judged 'against' god rather than 'by' god. If god had made a different choice, it would have created a different reality. What matters is the reality YOU deal with. For instance, what do you do when you stub your toe? Is there a single perfectly good response? Is it possible to create a free-thinking being who always chooses ""good""? That depends; who's judging?

as I said, it's a lack of imagination about the nature of god and reality. You presume we don't make ""good"" choices. Maybe we do. Maybe that's more horrifying to consider. There's tons of nuance there, and tons of room for interpretation. We're so limited. You can't even really have a real discussion about ""god"" without defining and agreeing upon the definition (which may or may not be true anyway). 

I guess another way to put that, is to bring up ""I think therefore I am"". Without nitpicking, it's the only thing you can 100% know. You exist. Everything outside of you is not 100% knowable. Solipsism, p-zombies, simulation theories, etc are all possible, but you cannot know it since you are limited to one singular perspective. So even when dealing with something as basic as scientific theory, it's ALL built on at least ONE assumption (which isn't falsifiable). Therefore even a well studied natural phenomenon isn't necessarily True. But the 'you' that experiences that phenomenon IS true, and by extension, your thoughts and feelings towards it are also True Expressions of Will. Since Will acts perfectly, it reinforces actual truth but by experiencing so much of one limited perspective, your ego creates all these stories and beliefs about the world around you that are false. This means Will can be perfect and act perfectly through you, and you may do things that are irrational, but you still did so 'perfectly' based on the full context. Meaning all choices made are 'perfect' or 'appropriate' for that subjective being at that time. It's just impossible for us to know how it's perfect since we lack tons of information going into that choice. 

I guess my main point is that life is the way god experiences limitation, and by that limitation, experiences the illusion of freedom and change. When we're talking about free will, we're talking about our ability to be different from each other. You can't force one ""good"" way of thinking onto the world without preventing people from having their own interpretation of reality. 'Your' truth. And that is literally the only thing you really have. 

hope that made a little sense. it's difficult to talk about right."
DebateReligion,ffc9ynt,t1_ffbyqd6,1579794893.0,"It stems from a lack of knowledge combined with our capacity to recognize it. Eg, in darkness, you can't see as well. faced with this kind of sensory deprivation, you're more sensitive to your 'new' weaknesses. becoming more aware of your weaknesses in the face of the unknown can instill a number of feelings depending on how you've grown. you can't prevent a conscious entity from fixating on negativity and fearing the dark, or from making illogical leaps about demons lurking in the shadows without actively intervening and violating their free will. natural laws do not contradict themselves. why would an all powerful being act in a way that contradicts logic, thus rendering truth itself meaningless? 

to create 'happy and free' beings, you must control their thoughts to always be happy, meaning they aren't free to think and act as they so choose. it also means they would be incapable of understanding concepts like danger or loss (or more simply, the basic binary of will, 'good bad', 'true untrue', 'desirable undesirable'; all life has distinct ways of judging/reacting to the dichotomy, eg running away from predation or chasing for food, with varying levels of sophistication and specialization). I point out my comparison to mmos again; what happens to a game when people aren't allowed to lose? If you create a being that is happy when it's wrong and happy when it's right, what incentive is there to get it right?"
DebateReligion,ffb3s40,t3_esl52u,1579751046.0,"Suffering doesn't come from outside you, but from within. Your free will is the cause of suffering. Although most theists don't talk about it this way, it's not about the free will of others allowing them to harm you, but how YOU choose to view the world outside of you.

The problem is many theists and atheists lack imagination when it comes to god. They both seem to limit their definition of god to something very specific, expecting the great Unknowable to be one particular way, usually based on what the church/culture says about god (which does vary to some degree, to be fair). But I like to think of it like this;

Imagine you are a god with the ability to create sentient life forms. For the sake of argument, you want them to be happy and free. You can't force them to be happy without controlling their thoughts, but their existence is difficult, at least usually if not always, because they don't understand how to 'think' and 'exist' and thoughts and feelings get in the way and can cause them to spiral into negativity. So how do you help them learn how to 'think' and 'exist' happily without violating their freedom? You find a way to teach them. So how do you do that without violating their freedom or making them unhappy? If it were me, I'd create a simulation for them to explore, where the only thing that matters in MY world is what they learn from it. Set up a few basic rules (aka laws of nature) and bring them back to my world after they 'die' in the game.

Being presumably wiser than my creations, I would grill them about their choices in life, which bear in mind, the truth can be quite painful. Even very good people struggle with the reality of their choices. That process of facing their choices would suffice as punishment, in my book, since their 'pain' essentially highlights the main areas they're struggling with (think getting a question wrong on a test, it can hurt but also shows you where you can improve), and their own ego would fuck them up just being in my presence. I would be kind to them, and show them where they could improve, and I'd let them enjoy my world (i imagine it'd be kinda dream-like, doing whatever they wanted for however 'long' they wanted, since my realm would likely be beyond time), and then once they were ready to grow again, I'd send them back to the simulation for another round. If they found they had nothing to improve and I was satisfied with their growth, they could chill in my realm until they inevitably changed their mind or got bored. I would even help them plan out their new life and show them how it'll unfold (and reminding them that they will forget most of this stuff when they're spawned in). My realm would essentially allow unlimited access to knowledge, so pretty much everything they experience is entirely voluntary (aside from being created originally I suppose, but then again, did god decide to be created? how do you do that without having already existed? evolution baby! and the possibility that consciousness is all part of the Creator, meaning its still voluntary)

Although I'm not sure I believe in reincarnation, I more or less think this is a good model for how things work, or how a god might deal with these issues, that also explains what I've witnessed. Effectively, this means 'suffering' is meaningless and temporary, except how YOU respond to it. I would have absolutely NO reason, nor desire, to change the supposed 'suffering' of this fake world. And it would be detrimental to my end goals if I WERE to change it. For example, it would ruin multiplayer games if no one was ever allowed to lose. You can't really 'learn' if you're tapped into all knowledge, and you'll eventually hit a point where either you can't understand the knowledge provided, or you want to FORGET. There's pleasure to be had in having a journey. When you know everything, I imagine most, if not all, people would give ANYTHING to 'forget' most of it and see reality (or a game) through virgin eyes. Hell, there are people right now who would love to forget. It's not hard to expand that to 'knowing everything' and understanding everyone wouldn't want that forever.

That's how I see it. Saying it's an 'excuse' is just a way to dismiss the truth that lies behind it (even if the speaker is blind to that truth, and even if I'm wrong with my read of it). Or, maybe not 'truth', so much as a possibility you don't want to accept as being possible. It's entirely possible that a god could be loving and kind and all powerful and all knowing, and you still stub your toe in the middle of the night. People don't want to believe that. It's much easier to say 'god wills it' or 'god must not exist because of it', but both of those are just self-soothing narratives to avoid considering the true terror of the void.

I struggle with it myself. But over time, trying to understand the concept of god has helped me to suffer less, or at least, to use that suffering to my advantage. More than I used to, at least, and at the end of the day, that's all I really want."

AskReddit,ffavq8b,t3_eskc2n,1579745599.0,"nothing, so far. I rarely know if they're overweight, and often I'm not even sure they're male. I'm a bit of an oddball, I like more meat on a man, and I like gamers, so I'm predisposed to like the demographic. But the closest I've gotten was on discord, me and a guy were talking for hours. It was a really fun conversation, interesting, challenging, and he just had a cool yet different perspective than me on many things. It wasn't so different that we couldn't agree on many things, or that I couldn't follow his thought process, but it was different enough to tickle my brain and be really interesting. 

the only problem was, he over-reached and basically said the only reason he was talking with me so much was because I was a woman and that he was interested in sex. It's just the way things are, and I can understand it, but it was such a mood-killer and I couldn't talk with him like that again. Guys have it hard, and I appreciate that he was honest, but it's such a shame that I can't have a great convo with a guy without basically having to assume the only reason he's giving me his time is for a chance at the smash. even though I can sorta understand WHY that's the case. 

There's no 100% effective technique in getting a woman interested in you. Many women make up their minds about whether they'd get sexual with you within a few minutes of talking with you, and you're more likely to reduce your chances the more you talk with them by 'messing up' (but it CAN be increased, don't get me wrong!). And on top of that, I'd assume the majority of women aren't going to be playing a game with the intent of hooking up. For me, it's kinda the opposite. The more I get to know a guy, the more interested I get, especially when they make mistakes, and I start out with the default of no-sexual-interest with everyone. And unfortunately (albeit gratefully), most guys proclaim their sexual interest early on (or it becomes obvious that they're playing the nice-guy card). But for me, that just means I should stop talking to them altogether, since my interest is either non-existent, or too low to be worth pulling him along in the unlikely chance I'd actually want to get smashy with him. it's kinda selfish, in my opinion, to 'waste' his time like that, especially when I know what he wants. 

The only tip I can give is to just be genuine and humble, but to have confidence in yourself. self awareness isn't talked about, but it leads to all those things, which are super attractive. Consider it this way; a woman is seen as an opportunity to a man. While a man is seen as a risk to a woman. Do you play games in the hopes of increasing risk in your life? Neither do women, which is why most of them, in game, prefer going incognito. 

I should have never used voice chat for that guild. It was great to talk with them for the short while I was there, but also, it inevitably made it too weird and stressful for me to come back and ruined the whole point of playing a game. Unfortunately, and strangely, a woman has better odds of finding a good mate if he doesn't know she's a woman. You're more likely to realize he's an asshole without all the romantic pretenses clouding your judgment. 

so I guess, **TL;DR** my best advice is this: Don't ask if they're a male or female. be ok with lack of voice chat (unless the game essentially demands it, in which case, I get it). and eventually you might find your gamer friend might 'come out' as an interested potential mate. 

this is probably terrible advice but it's the best i can give. maybe it helps someone out there learn something. idfk. the only other advice I could give is to study women with humility and as much objectivity as you can (given the subjective nature of something as general as a gender, this is difficult). Remember they're still just people. Practice sympathy, and work on yourself as much as possible. At least then, even if you don't ever get a girl, you'll at least be a better, more understanding person."
wholesomememes,ffassb2,t1_ff9ovpu,1579743653.0,"since I'm not seeing other comments getting into this, and I'm curious, could you elaborate a little bit on the nature of these compliments? for example, is it something like they compliment your clothes but you dismiss it because you don't care about your clothing choices? you mentioned in another comment that it's stuff you're consciously faking, which could be anything, so I'm curious.

also, if you don't mind me asking, is there some way you can express yourself more genuinely without necessarily giving away too much (since I understand there's tons of legitimate reasons to fake)? maybe something as simple as wearing more clothes that are hobby or interest based? The only compliments I really get are compliments on my clothes from fans of whatever I'm wearing, or from people in a mental ward or online. not that it matters that much I suppose, but still, I'm curious."

But consider this. when you get positive feedback, it make sense to make changes in response to that, just like it would make sense if it were negative feedback. it might be easy to poke fun at, but also, what *should* you do in that situation? Wear them MORE? do everything in your power to wear them the exact same amount as you did pre-compliment so as to not appear swayed? that don't make a lick of sense. 

that might just be part of the struggle of learning humility. people don't like to admit how easily they're swayed by the opinions of others, but also, outside perspective can be absolutely invaluable, so of COURSE you're bound to make changes based on outside input. our egos can be really fickle, even for the silliest little things. 

i bet you look really good in glasses too, btw. some people get thrown off by glasses, but they don't really change how you look that much. not sure if that helps to point out, but I hope you keep it in mind when you muse over that compliment in the future. girls, in a very generalized way and esp when younger, tend to prefer guys without glasses, mostly just because of the 'nerdy' implication. so it makes sense some young girl would note a difference, and it makes sense that you would wear them less in response! But keep in mind, tons of girls like the nerdy look too and would think the opposite! So I hope nowadays you do whatever makes you feel good; whether that's contacts or wearing them when needed or whatever. best of luck out there :)"
wholesomememes,ffaoikz,t3_esf08z,1579740786.0,"it's weird, i like to give out compliments to people. particularly if there's something about them that catches my eye that is choice-based, think clothing, hair style, jewelry, etc. But i can't remember the last time I complimented a man (not counting my father i guess).

I really don't know why. I mean, I sorta do. Most of the people I deal with are cashiers or receptionists, who are mostly female. And in those rare times it's a guy, they most likely won't have anything remarkable to compliment on that is choice based, since men are discouraged from 'dressing up'. Most men are either presentable or slothy, with the rare instance where he is very well dressed (which just doesn't happen in customer service jobs)

I'm a little sad about that, even if it makes total sense. Guys usually don't wear jewelry or wear unique, pleasing colors. Guys don't usually put much effort or thought into their hair or clothing, and they usually don't wear makeup (and if they do, it's likely going to be unnoticeable to me, aka a natural look). So the only real thing that might catch my eye is something they can't control. Physical looks.

But, also, the only reason I don't want to compliment physical appearance is because I feel it's rude. I'm a woman, women are in a different ball park here. Guys don't get compliments about their looks the same way women do, and I think most would be very flattered. But unfortunately, I have to be very careful if I DO compliment a guy, since a guy might understandably take that as an opportunity for romance or sex, and it'd be awkward as fuck to compliment him and then turn him down within a couple minutes. (I'm not interested in dating for the foreseeable future, even for a major catch)

Also, compliments are more of a feminine thing. Guys are less likely to give compliments in my experience, just as they're less likely to receive them. And if they do give compliments, it's mostly likely stemming from some level of attraction. While a girl complimenting another girl is (usually) just being nice.

It's one of those weird things. Girls are drowning in them, while boys are starved for them.

Just my perspective on it. But I also think I'm going to make a point of trying to give men more compliments, even if it's just 'i like your shirt' or 'can i see your tat' or something. they probably appreciate it way more than a woman would. although, that IS generalizing too."

DebateReligion,feb1gvb,t3_enzn3e,1578954519.0,"I believe that even if a god DID reveal themselves, we likely wouldn't recognize it as such.

What 'counts' as a deity having revealed itself? Even if a giant head appeared in the skies and spoke to all peoples, proclaiming its status as a deity, and performing 'miracles' to prove its power, there would be plenty of people who would question or doubt, possibly even more than they already do. People would say 'holograms!', 'aliens!', 'the devil!', or any number of different explanations for such an occurrence. It would not be proof of a god, or the 'right' god, as it would only be proof of a powerful entity.

I believe in god. Over the 30 odd years I've been alive, I've been observing and experiencing so many different things, and the only thing that makes sense to me is that there must be some form of higher being than us, but that our cognitive limitations prevent us from recognizing it (as is with many atheists or agnostics), or leads us to misunderstand it (as is the case with many believers). What the true nature of this higher entity may be, I don't know. But I can make some assumptions.

I think about it in a similar way as I do my pets. A cat may not recognize you as a 'god', provider of sustenance and the 'creator' of its living situation, instead seeing us more like a strange mother or father to them. A dog may grossly misunderstand you but worship you nonetheless, believing you to be a god. Being a 'pet' to a higher entity is the most easily comprehended relationship for humans to regard the divine, imo. What does pet ownership mean, in owner terms vs pet terms? What is the divide of awareness between pet and owner?

If I was a pet belonging to a god, what would I expect? And if I was an owner of a human pet, what would I expect of other owners? The disparity is quite immense, and that's with a super basic, humanized lens of 'pet ownership'. But if I, say, owned an entire planet of living creatures, what would we expect to find? Basic needs met (sun and material), at bare minimum, with some interventionist care (we repair ourselves to some extent, though this goes to a 'creator' god more than an 'owner' god), and some level of freedom within our confines (free will). We would expect that the vast majority of our lives would be seemingly 'without' intervention, as our 'owner' would mostly enjoy observing us or doing things we can't comprehend in order to provide for us (or even just taking time for 'selfish' self care, which is actually necessary to care for the pet). A dog doesn't understand the process of buying dog food, nor does a cat understand all the things that have to happen so you can dump a bag of kitty litter in their poop box. There is so much unknown to the pet, and this says NOTHING of creation as a power (which we arguably still have, as well as our pets, and a god to us would likely be on a completely different level; having less in common with us than we do to our pets).

When I consider it from this angle, I find it extremely fascinating and very good to muse over. It's easier to recognize logical fallacies when you can compare your thought process around 'god' to your thought process around a pet. It's more tangible to us, while still having glaring problems ofc. But they're DIFFERENT problems than the kind that many non-theists chew over. For example, many say 'if god is real, god is bad', but how can we know whether those things are 'necessary', like a dog kennel or vet visit, or 'abusive/neglectful', like kicking a dog or not taking it to a vet?

If god exists, and hell exists, and salvation is dependent on believing in the 'right' god, and god HASN'T appeared to reveal itself to us, then I would assume I am the one making a mistake; misinterpreting something along this line. What is the nature of this god, what is hell, what is salvation, why would it depend on the 'right' god, what would it mean to reveal itself, and why wouldn't it do so in order to help us? There are a TON of different places where the logic breaks down. We simply do not know ENOUGH, and the language is far too vague. 'God' needs to be defined, as does hell and salvation (while also demonstrating that hell and salvation as NECESSARY aspects of reality), before you can even BEGIN to muse over any 'why's.

Most kinds of baby food are good because they're generally smaller portions with low sugar content. just keep an eye out for citrus or mango! d-limonene is bad for boys :) I hear dark chocolate is a good treat, esp if they're struggling with a respiratory infection. something in it can help open up the lungs. just keep it a rare treat because of the sugar (if they'll even take it, one of mine didn't like it lol!)

I got my boys on dec 15th, not even a month yet! they're my first rats, so I'm very empathetic with your situation hehe! one fun thing is you can save boxes/jugs/containers/paper, and give them to the rats, or make different climbing toys or hides out of them. there's a lot of fun ways you can make things for them on the cheap. i have to say, it's quite fun to get a 'free rat toy' with many everyday purchases LOL I use a LOT of tissue paper, so it's great that the boxes can be used (you can even make towers out of them, especially good for playtime)

I hear they also like to chew on bones, especially chicken. Haven't tried it yet but worth noting. Thankfully rats are generally pretty smart about what they actually eat. http://www.ratfanclub.org is one of my absolute favorite resources on all things rats. If you haven't stumbled across it yet, definitely check it out. 

I've fallen into the habit of giving them a treat whenever I'm eating. It's better not to give them too much butter/fat, salt, sugar, or protein (esp if you're already feeding them something like oxbow, which provides good protein), but they'll pretty much eat anything we can eat. I avoid spicy stuff or citrus altogether, too. I ""have"" to keep crackers/nuts in case our meal isn't the healthiest for them LOL Enjoy spoiling your babies :)"
RATS,fdrpk50,t1_fdrh0w4,1578687751.0,"I second lava ledges. I've heard they might fall off the screw sometimes, but this can be fixed with some hotglue. And don't over-tighten them, just enough to be snug. Mine really love them, and the boy that uses them most often also has less sharp nails, so they do help. They will chew on them too, which is good. Rats seem to really love having different ledges to climb or sit on. it's well worth a try!"
RATS,fdrood2,t1_fdr5s8a,1578687460.0,"They also have hoodies with a 'kangaroo' style pouch in front. I got one for my boys and they LOVE it. but regular hoodies are also loved! they especially like to crawl into my sleeves, it's hilarious, so just for that I recommend hoodies over pouches. However, I have no experience with bonding bags but I'm sure they would be enjoyed as well.

In case you haven't heard this suggestion, try baby food! just avoid citrus (some include lemon juice, which might be okay since the problem chemical is in the rinds, but I still avoid those just to be safe. i think if they have ascorbic acid, it's ok). Both of mine really love the squash, and the texture is nice and thick (sweet potato is another good one). teach them how to lap up liquid food by offering it on a metal spoon a couple times, and then you can switch to your fingers/hands, and it really helps the taming process (and they ofc love the stuff). especially since they have to hang out with you a bit to get the treat! it can also keep them 'distracted' and in a positive mindset while you work them through handling (touching the back > light squeeze pressure > picking up momentarily > holding). Worked like an absolute charm on one boy, the other one isn't as food motivated so it doesn't work as well, but it still helps him quite a bit!

Hammocks don't have to be complicated or expensive either! You can honestly just buy some fleece, cut it into the right size, poke some holes in the corners, and hang them up by shower curtain rings or zipties or pipe cleaners or string or whatever else you might have. A yard's worth can make quite a few of them, and you can get it on sale for 3-10 bucks a yard, upwards of 15 if it's not on sale, depending on whether you get solid colors or patterns. You can also use fleece blankets from stores or goodwill, sometimes for even cheaper than straight cloth. Fleece also makes good blankets for them (I recommend having paper towels underneath to help soak up pee), mine seem to like them. They can be washed easily and reused, even if chewed (to a point hehe). I can't comment much on chewing, as mine don't seem to chew on the hammocks at all, thankfully.

CasualConversation,fcn1k3l,t3_ehz6di,1577800615.0,this is a great idea. it's similar to journaling but easier and still gives you something to reflect over. i imagine this can help you gauge how you're doing mentally too.
AskReddit,fcn0674,t1_fclwozq,1577799359.0,"I don't think I claimed they were bad. Just that a diet is unhealthy if it doesn't provide your needs from whole foods. Fortified foods are, at least imo, better, but still not really 'healthy'. It's another step away from whole foods, requires processing, and I've read they have similar problems as pills. Too lazy to double check it. For instance, I know the iron they add to, say, cereals is a very different kind of iron than you'd find in whole foods, one that is cheap and not as bioavailable.

It's very difficult to do research on diets. Two vegans can have vastly different diets. Vegans are prone to certain deficiencies, though, meaning yes, we see negative health outcomes from vegan diets. This stuff is complicated and difficult to research. My point still stands. 

I agree we are a behaviorally ominvorous species. But physiologically, we are similar to dogs. Carnivorous, requiring animal byproducts to survive, but capable of digesting grains/plants/etc. We don't require anything from plants that we cannot also get from meat. Omnivores can live off both. We need meat, but can digest both (to varying degrees, plants are harder for us to digest and our intestines aren't long enough to truly process most plant matter). 

Ah, less plants killed. I see, I misunderstood you, sorry about that. That's a fair point, but we need to keep in mind our biological needs as well. Everything starts with the self, so to respect life beyond yourself, you must start by respecting the life within yourself. I'm not sure how the actual amounts play out (diet and food chains are complicated, but we do require less meat to match veggies in weight), but your point is still good. 

The person said nothing about stomping the dog to death. Using equal force, you're more likely to kill the plant than the dog. What is the real moral issue with stomping a lifeform? Is it only the pain you recognize them experiencing? Or is it the actual amount of harm you can cause them? Why is it worse to, say, stomp a puppy than a full grown dog? Presumably, it's because the puppy is more vulnerable, not because it experiences 'more pain'. Vulnerability is a huge part of the morality of harmful actions against life. Plants are quite vulnerable to us compared to a dog. The dog can defend itself or run away. I interpreted the comparison in a way where stomping doesn't necessarily mean intent to harm, either, with the same amount of force applied; let alone 'intentionally stomping to death'. The most likely scenario where I would stomp a flower or a dog with the same force, would be accidentally stepping on my own pet vs stepping on a flower, where I might not even NOTICE, let alone care as much as I would stepping on a dog. People feel less remorse for the harm they cause plants 'because they don't feel pain like we do', etc. But there are laws in place to try to help animals. I don't think LEGALLY they should be treated the same, but philosophically, I think there's plenty of room for interpretation and argument. That was my meaning, and the way I answered. Sorry for any confusion there. 

[Plants feel something akin to pain](https://allthatsinteresting.com/plants-defense-mechanism). 

What does it mean to 'respond to stimuli'? But to be aware of it, to 'feel' it? Probably not 'felt' in the same way we feel it, but how do we recognize pain in an animal? They make noise, they move, they attack defensively, etc, all things a plant cannot do. How are we to recognize their knowledge, when our own perception is based so heavily on our experience with our biology? Also, I know mycelium has been shown to judge, or 'know', time. They 'prepare' for a timed changed in temp/etc, even if the change doesn't come. Our consciousness is run on proteins, enzymes, and hormones, just like a plant. So where is that consciousness coming from? (edit; i wanted to clarify, I know that fungus is actually more closely related to animals than plants, but I know a lot more about mushrooms than plants, and many people tend to clump the two together. sorry for any confusion there)

Point 1, that wasn't my only point here. If you're going to alter your diet for moral reasons, than your reasoning should be sound. Wolves, for example, helped yellowstone flourish. The morality of killing and eating an animal is difficult to quantify compared to the plants for a ton of reasons. But morality is not about quantity. It's about reality, truth, and living in a way that reduces harm as much as possible and nurturing growth, understanding, and health as much as possible. You're not wrong to bring this up, but this particular point wasn't MY point, it was me pointing out one of the fallacies of moral veganism, and a very common one. Vegans rarely care or recognize the sanctity of plant life, because...well, they gotta eat, and they relate more to animals than plants. It's just ignoring the bigger philosophical implications of our needs and desires vs the morality of satisfying ourselves.

Point 2, you haven't demonstrated how a vegan diet is healthy. A healthy diet satisfies all your nutritional needs with whole, healthy foods. You can eat 100% meat and get everything you need (say, personally raised or hunted). But if you ate 100% plants (whole, unadulterated, home-grown), you would absolutely be deficient. It's also very difficult to grow your own variety of plants to fulfill your nutritional needs (look at what it takes to grow certain plants, esp climate). But you could easily live off hunts alone. People have done it since before agriculture even existed. 

Thanks for taking the time to respond and break down your perspective. It's pretty interesting stuff, I just wish it was easier to talk about. It's so easy to misunderstand one another or to follow different thinking patterns with something as complicated as diet."
AskReddit,fcmy67g,t1_fclhfpd,1577797324.0,"[Here](https://allthatsinteresting.com/plants-defense-mechanism). That's also not my point. My point is, if you're doing it for moral reasons, you should consider the morality beyond your human-based ego. People commonly disregard the pain animals feel because they don't *recognize* it as pain. Or they say they don't have 'souls' while claiming humans do. Etc. It's fallacious to ignore the depth and complexity of one living creature while supposedly trying to prevent the 'relatable' suffering of others.

Central nervous system is not a necessary requirement for 'pain'. It's just different from what we might recognize, having central nervous systems. Sentience is pretty difficult to define, too. They are aware of their surroundings. We're just not entirely sure how complex their awareness is. Remember, we don't even understand our OWN sentience."

Even between carnivores/omnivores/vegans. Go look at the inuit, who live almost exclusively on animal products.

for instance, a lot of science derps seem to stem from a lack of recognition of the Observer coming before the hypothesis/theory/etc. And how solipsism cannot be disproven, p-zombies, all those philosophical things. They tend to forget that truth has nothing to do with causality, but with perspective. Something can be true in one circumstance and false in another. Usually science derps recognize that last one, to some degree, but they usually don't quite realize the implications, or how it applies to truth and evidence. many of them tend to fall prey to the fallacy of authority too.

AskReddit,fcl95py,t1_fcl6yul,1577742513.0,"You literally have to add supplements to a vegan diet in order for it to be 'healthy'. That is NOT a healthy diet. A healthy diet consists of whole foods. I'm sure you don't disagree with that. Look into the research done on supplements. [Here's one](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2019/04/16/study-finds-no-benefit-for-dietary-supplements/). Whole food is always best. Plenty of research out there to back me up and I'm going to be lazy here, because anyone who cares about veganism should already understand this. There are endless discussions about supplementation. It's an intrinsic part of being a 'healthy' vegan.   

We cannot get b12 from plants. Only animal products. They also struggle to get enough of several other vital nutrients [Here](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/guide/vegetarian-and-vegan-diet#2), like calcium and iron, among others. Nutrients found in plants are not highly bioavailable to us (and plants have many mechanisms in place that actually make it less available. consider oxalates)  

If you need to eat animals to survive (ignoring supplements, since they aren't shown to be very effective anyway), but do not need to eat plants to survive, you are a carnivore. Our guts are VERY short for apes (a trait found in carnivores), our brains require high amounts of energy (best provided by meat, and likely grew so big BECAUSE we scavanged and killed animals to eat). There is no such thing as a vegan civilization.   

I'm sorry I can't take the time to source everything here, but if you care enough to ask for sources from me, I hope you care enough to look into it yourself.   

My point isn't that I care about plants. My point is that if you chose not to eat meat for moral reasons, you are disregarding the moral implications of eating plants. As well as your own living cells. Plants also use humans to propagate and survive. I care about finding a balance, and not holding fallacious beliefs if I can help it. I'm not going to starve myself in order to pretend to be some sort of moral purist, because I don't believe we're on this planet to be morally pure. But that's a whole different topic.   
  
Yes, stomping on a flower is equivalent to stomping on a dog. Don't forget; at least the dog can bite you or run away. There has been research showing that plants feel something akin to pain. Just because they don't yelp and physically jolt and run away doesn't mean they aren't worthy of your consideration (especially if you make a point to be 'respectful' to life by refusing to eat meat). It's hypocrisy, at worst, and ignorance at best.   

Plants are definitely eldritch gods. Most of them evolved into their basic genetic state FAR before our ancestors could even be considered primitive monkeys. Mushrooms, which are closer to us evolutionarily speaking, are even MORE insane. You don't need a vertebra to have an intense awareness of your surroundings. Plants know when the wind blows. Your imagination is just lacking. And I'm admittedly being a bit hyperbolic to make my point. Point out the fallacies in my points. There is so much we simply do not understand about plants.   

Seems fine to you? How? Where are the fallacies in my points, if moral veganism is so sound? Humans are animals. We are naturally more likely to sympathize with animals. That doesn't mean that the way plants exist is 'less aware' than us. Mycelium has been shown to create exceptionally sophisticated and efficient channels of transferring resources. Better even than what humans design. Fungal intelligence is a real thing. They're better at mazes than rats and humans. [Check it out](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/brainless-slime-molds/), there's quite a bit of info out there about it, and it's utterly mindblowing.

What are the harms that could come of it? What unintended consequences may arise if we walk this path? It's really difficult for me to think of them, and that...honestly? kinda terrifies me. I can think of bad things pot can bring (less motivation, dullness, mental addiction, etc). But....what are the downsides of psychedelics? Mental illnesses may worsen, even though it also seems to be a promising treatment for it? Or perhaps, more awareness, widespread use, and greater understanding of these drugs will spark the REAL revolution that will be utterly devastating to our current way of life. Perhaps in a positive way, like birth pangs, painful and difficult but ultimately worthwhile, or possibly in a negative way, like a reckless child with a flamethrower, too much for the average person to handle, sending us back into a dark age (or even a far worse future for psych use)

AskReddit,fcl487l,t1_fckyjrp,1577739457.0,b12. whole foods are always superior to supplements.
AskReddit,fcl3shx,t1_fck76bb,1577739182.0,"While I wouldn't call them monsters, yes, vegan is not only deeply misunderstood, but also is pretty unhealthy. If you have to add a supplement to your diet in order for your diet to give you all the nutrition you need, it is not the right diet for you. We are essentially carnivorous apes, but people don't know or talk about it. I suspect this is because it's much cheaper and easier to feed an omnivorous or herbivorous population, and it keeps us consumptive, weak, and unhealthy. Similar to dogs, while we CAN eat plants, you'll get sicker faster if you eat pure vegan as opposed to eating pure carnivore. We can get everything we need from animal byproducts, but this cannot be said of plants. Our guts are just better suited for meat, too. We were very likely scavengers once, after all. It's a relatively recent change but there's a marked difference in the health of pre and post agricultural populations.

It's a fascinating topic. And raises a lot of big questions about how we should deal with it. But I've seen it first hand, and heard dozens upon dozens of stories from vegans who, after 1-5 years, start getting VERY sick. Also, while some vegan food can be healthy, some of it isn't. Sugar and empty carbs like corn or other grains are vegan. Heavily processed foods can be vegan. While I can sympathize with the moral vegan, it's a fallacious point of view. You can't decide your biology. It's okay to need animals to survive. And it's a very human-centric view to disregard the morality of eating plants. Keep in mind, too, that while animals evolved to put their energy into flight or fight, plants put their energy into mastering chemistry in order to avoid predation. Aka by attacking things that eat them from within. And they are insanely good at it. We rarely recognize just how complex  and advanced they really are, in part because of how different they are from us. It's easy to use human biology to empathize with a dog or cow. Plants are like eldritch gods compared to us, yet we love to think of ourselves as 'above' them, more 'advanced', more 'aware'. Life is complicated business. You aren't 'respecting' life by disregarding your own biology and dismissing the complex nature of the plants you consume. At least if you eat meat, you're respecting your own biology, which is a start. And there's a reason so many peoples practiced reverence for the kills they made. Hell, it could be just to help us cope with the fact that we had to do it to begin with. 

Not to say that factory farming is GOOD either. But it's important to have a sound belief system, and moral veganism doesn't stand to scrutiny, and reeks of human ego. It's pretty fascinating that we have so many issues with something as 'simple' as our diet. Not so long ago, we were stuck eating the same few staples, you'd think that as a species, we wouldn't have so many anxieties around food these days. And I'm no different. I have no fucking clue how to eat properly. I really need to work on it, damn.

Bonus: we don't have to eat every day either, and it's probably healthier for us to fast. Most people can go weeks or months without eating with no ill effect. So maybe instead of worrying about WHAT you eat, consider the FREQUENCY. Whether for morality or health, there's a lot of dark reasons we eat so damn much."

They're wonderful, super underrated pets. I bet you'll adore them! Just be mindful of their short lives (I've had many people say they were the best pets except for that. some take it pretty hard) and make the most of it. If you haven't heard this yet, I highly recommend baby food! Prime them by using a metal spoon so they learn to lick liquid food instead of biting it (mine learned within 2 offerings, and it helps that they don't want to hurt you!), then you can use it on your hand and fingers to help get them comfortable with handling. It's worked like a charm, and they adore it. So far I like using carrot and squash, because they stick well to your fingers (unlike green beans or chicken. still good treats tho!)

SeriousConversation,fcjlhwd,t3_ehgrwx,1577692555.0,"Definitely. I would say, at least make yourself a bucket list first. Even if you feel like there's 'nothing' you want to do, you can think of a few things if you put your mind to it. For example, I wanted to own at least one more pet, and I wanted to stick around until they died. I sorta cheated and got rats, which only live 1-3 years lol but it works for me, surprisingly well.

I also told myself that I would try psychedelic mushrooms as my last ditch effort to 'treat' myself. It was pretty much the only thing I actually wanted to do before I died, but also, it's potential to help made me feel like I owed it to myself to at least TRY. Since I'm a hermit, I had to learn how to grow them, so I knew it would take time, but I was already wanting to die, what was another year? It gave me something to work on, to improve on, to keep me busy when things were rough. And I figured, afterwards, I would reconsider my gameplan depending on how they effected me. I have since tried them, had 3 trips fairly close to each other. The shrooms are...pretty incredible to me. The experience was something I had been seeking for decades, even though it was very different than I expected (more mild, not as visually intense, not super 'think' heavy, etc). I wouldn't say they 'fixed' me or anything, but from the time I decided to try them, to now, I kept working on my thought patterns and belief system, and now, although I still suspect I'll eventually end my own life, I feel no rush to do it. It's more of a realistic sort of understanding I have, considering my absolute hatred of prolonged, unnecessary suffering. It's inhumane to let 'nature take its course' with this kind of thing. It's cruel to do to your pet, and it's cruel to do to a human. So I don't care if it's illegal. I do, however, care about the spiritual impacts, on family, on my own soul, etc. So I don't want to rush into it carelessly. if only for my own conscience.

I want to explore cubensis. I want to muse over my new pets (they are rats, and they are extremely fascinating to me, not just in a basic pet way, but in a deeper, spiritual way). I should be able to make it at least another 2 years with these two, and my life has markedly improved over the last year (heck, the last 5 or 10, even, in some ways). After these guys pass, I don't know. Maybe I'll get more rats, maybe the shrooms will have helped me overcome my deeper mental struggles. Maybe I'll start planning. I don't know. But for now, I feel good. Things are ok right now. It's not much, but it's enough for me for now.

But what I can say, is try to find something similar. Maybe even try psychs of some kind (but please be careful and respect the drug). You don't really have much to lose by coming up with shit to put on your bucket list. Imo, just thinking about what you might put on it can help. It kinda encourages you to think more productively, instead of getting stuck in pits of shit. But remember; some situations make it nearly impossible for you to kill yourself, even if you're in a worse place than you are now. Prioritize, be careful, keep yourself out of jail, and give it your best shot. I can't imagine the gods would scorn you for killing yourself if you genuinely tried your best to avoid it. Be kind to yourself; like you would to a very dear friend going through something similar. I'm sorry you're going through this. I hope something here helps, even if only in a tiny way."
CasualConversation,fcj1sju,t3_eh9nqx,1577675143.0,"I had a shirt with a holographic aquatic scene on it. Simple, nice, pretty. I got made fun of, saying it looked like they could see inside me, that I was an alien. I never wore it again.

It really wasn't that bad, honestly the kid was mostly just commenting on how cool it looked. But I'm still in the closet about my non-terrestrial origins. Proud of ya"
RationalPsychonaut,fc7xu4b,t3_egjypf,1577521508.0,"Amanita muscaria was my only suggestion. I don't think there is such a thing as a beginner psychedelic, let alone one that's legal (except kinda-sorta marijuana). The whole reason they make these things illegal is to make it more difficult for people who want to explore plant medicines, so it would be pretty dumb if they overlooked one that was 'easy'. While I can understand the desire not to do anything ""illegal"", perhaps it's important for her to have a better understanding of legality itself before dabbling in this stuff. There's no real way around that issue, and it's been an intrinsic part of psychedelics in US culture for a very long time now. It's important to have a healthy understanding of all that stuff, or at least, a healthier perspective on it.

For example; is it really a discomfort with lying, or legality? Or is she, like many, many people, giving ""illegal"" more weight than it really deserves? After all, the average person commits TONS of ""crimes"" without even knowing it. I wouldn't push the issue with her either. I suspect she perceives the 'severity' of drug use as higher than other crimes, and may have other hangups about it. Although I appreciate anyone who's willing to explore psychs, I don't spend much time with them on this if they are really concerned with the legality of it. Even if they DO take a chance, they're going to have more anxiety around the experience anyway (even if that anxiety doesn't focus around legality! usually that much concern around 'the law' is a sign that their mind just isn't ready for something as challenging as a psych). They're more likely to struggle with 'hidden' beliefs/feelings around the topic, and that, to me, is a sign of a poor set. 

She could wait for laws to change or plan a trip to some place where it's legal. There's not much else she can do given these limitations, unfortunately."

spiritual,fc6soqv,t3_egchfr,1577488492.0,"I think about this a lot. I've noticed the less self-aware someone is, the more likely they are to project. I don't have enough experience to say that with much confidence, however, since you kinda have to really get to know someone in order to identify it as projection. But sometimes it can be kinda obvious. 

I think the important thing to keep in mind with the concept of projection is how little you really know of the person. But you can learn a lot, and it can help you deal with negative bs you get from people. 'This isn't a claim about ME, this is a projection of them or their accepted worldview.' For instance, I recently got rats, so the negative stereotypes around them has been on my mind lately. If someone says to me, 'rats are gross/diseased/etc', I could interpret it as an attack against me or my rats, or I could recognize that they're just projecting what they've always heard. You can learn a lot about someone by this kind of comment. Maybe that they're lazy with their mindscape and don't care or prioritize the truth very much (or don't care about defeating their 'enemy' and just want to make an easy snap judgment). Or maybe they had their own spark of interest in the topic get shot down by people they care about, so they defensively repeat what they were told. There's a massive variety of reasons for people saying what they say, or judging, or criticizing unfairly.

I think it's important to remember how little other people care about you. Particularly the randos you may meet throughout your life. Most people just have so much shit on their plate that they don't feel like prioritizing important spiritual practices. But remember, when considering projection, to use it predominantly to reflect on your OWN behavior and thinking patterns. It's easy to dismiss negative criticism that sounds like projection and use it to defend your ego. But try to use it as an opportunity to reflect on times when you are doing the same thing. Everyone's on their own journey.

I remember one time I brought up the 'frivolous' lawsuit that McDonald's faced once, with the lady who got burned by coffee that was too hot. One of the guys who heard this shot me down pretty firmly, saying that she had gotten horribly burned and that it wasn't frivolous at all. I hadn't heard this before and it shut me up pretty quick, and I later went to look into what he was saying. Lo and behold, I was very wrong (it was even worse than he suggested), and I was just another person who spread misinfo about the poor woman/family involved. Now, it wasn't necessarily projection in a typical sense, but it WAS a sign that I was too trusting of msm sources, and that I was willing to dismiss people who went through a horrible experience, because the 'story' of a frivolous lawsuit like that was more 'fun'. It was a sign that I was being lazy, not researching news stories or practicing skepticism enough. As in, it was easier for me to trust the Big Corporation than us 'little people'. Now, the reporting on it definitely tricked a LOT of people into misunderstanding the situation. But it was enlightening, not just for this single story, but for the way I look at media and the way people can use language to trick us.

In general, I agree with what you're saying. Everything we do or say is a projection of the way we think, the things we believe, and of how we interpret reality (as well as our experiences). Sometimes it's easy to spy, sometimes it's not. Sometimes it's bad projection (stemming from dumb shit), but sometimes it's good. We don't usually think of 'projection' as a good thing, but it can be one of the most powerful ways we can influence the world in a more positive way, without us even realizing it. This is why, I suspect, that improving your thinking patterns and beliefs is instrumental in having real positive change in the world. My friend's own effort into looking into the hot-coffee-lady's story ended up not only teaching me about the truth of the story and stopped me from misconstruing it in the future, but also taught me several truths about myself.  

Projection is an important thing to study. Just try not to get lazy with it and dismiss 'dumb people' because 'they must be projecting'. The waters go much deeper than that."
AskReddit,fbzsrn6,t1_fbzmyld,1577259600.0,"you made me realize why my family doesn't care about wearing shoes indoors. bringing in groceries. sometimes you have to take multiple trips, and it's annoying having to set shit down to kick off your shoes to put on your indoor shoes to drop everything off. It's just easier to bring in stuff or take stuff out with the shoes on, so it's a bit of a moot point to care much about leaving shoes by the door. Also, what about bathroom emergencies? Why care so much about some dirt on your shoes, when your body is coated in the stuff too, when you're about to shit yourself?

I'm still the kind of person who likes to leave shoes near the door. At least, away from certain areas, because it does keep things cleaner, I'm just no stickler about it. If i had my own house, depending on the layout, the kitchen would be a shoe zone, while the bedroom would be indoor-shoes-only. the rest would depend on practicality and working with the layout.

thanks for unintentionally helping me understand my own habits around shoe-use indoors."
