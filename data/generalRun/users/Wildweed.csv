Odds are pretty good they aren't replacing those old splitters if using the old existing cabling to transmit internet. When the speeds were slow it worked fine but now that were moving up the old splitters are outdated.

Once the interference is created on the line it's not going to go away. A good signal amplifier will do just that, boost the signal, not the static.
