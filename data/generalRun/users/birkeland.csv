dndnext,ff8upld,t1_ff8376b,1579696733.0,"Spells are limited to spell slots at least. I don't disagree that melee need something other than just attacking. I think fighters and barbarians in particular got screwed by this. My issue with shield block is that it is powerful enough that it makes it boring. I've played with shield block fighters before and every round is push them over (if they can) then attack three times with advantage. It's back to the 3.5 spring attack, 5ft step reach weapon builds, where doing anything but the same thing each time is boring.

Spells at least force decisions, casters need to work around resistances, utility, and managing resources. Shield block just makes it easier to hit, but forces the melee class to sacrifice ASIs and build options to do it. It's like GWM or sharpshooter. It doesn't require thought, mathematically it is just better unless there is a absurdly high AC, which is not hard to determine.

I'm not sure the solution, in my games I try to give melee some interesting abilities, like letting them use their reaction to move and be the focus of an attack action or spell. Or changing the whip to act more like thorn whip, allowing them to move mobs around their allies, giving them more control."

Fantasy,fedip61,t3_eokfws,1579012535.0,"So I decided to start the bingo card, all hard mode on New Years. As of the 12th, I am 7 squares in, so here are my reviews.

**Interview with a Vampire** by **Anne Rice** - I have a friend that has been bugging me to read this book for awhile. This same friend declares that she hates Wheel of Time two books in, because there is too much description. While that is a perfectly fair criticism of Jordan, how can you have that view and love this book. There are huge swaths of description about how beautiful seeing things through the eyes of a vampire are, and it gets difficult to slog through. Some of the things involving Claudia made me but this down and never pick it up again. The characters motivations usually make sense, but that doesn't make them particularly likeable or relatable, but in part I think that is a deliberate intention. In the end, I can appreciate it for what it is, an important book in the way vampires are seen in popular culture, which lead the way to far more interesting and better depicted versions. 

**Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal** by **Christopher Moore** - Overall I enjoyed this book. I feel it dragged in a few places, and is more of a popcorn read. While reading it I found it funny, but upon reflection realized how much of the humor was just repeated. The ending, while abrupt in ways, I think is a good counterpoint to the rest of the book. The interludes of modern times between ""writing"" but also left quite a few questions that never really get answered. In the end the ""dumbfucks"" exchange will still amuse me for awhile, and a book that can cause any part to stick is worth the read.

**The Blade Itself** by **Joe Abercrombie** - Man, never before in history has a book existed solely for the purpose of writing another book. I liked the character work, and I can see why people like this book, but I feel some plot needs to tie things together, and to say this book has a plot is generous. The style also seemed to change sometimes. In parts, Abercrombie sticks to show not tell, but other times there is a random exposition dump, or a thing pointed out for no reason in such a way the makes it obvious that it will be important is some way to the climax of the book. (climax, is that the climax, is there any climax at all?) Overall once I am done with this sprint, I do want to go back and finish the series, to see if the character building pays once there is a plot. For now however, this book feels like the Fellowship of the rings, if all of the book was the council of Elrond, or Way of Kings if it ended before the third act, there is promise, but I need to see the pay off.

**Ancillary Justice** by **Ann Leckie** - This book is a bit tough. It is very dense with a lot to unpack, and I think I may have to give it a reread before I try any other in the series. To address the first thing I've seen mentioned frequently is the use of pronouns. While an interesting choice, I thought it didn't add much to the story overall, and felt like when books are written in 2nd person, they do it just to be different. It did make the book more difficult to read for me, particularly in scenes where the characters change the language they use several times in the conversation, each with their own pronoun rules, with no indication in the text that they changed unless it is outright stated. Maybe there was a typeface or formating suggestion that could have helped with that, I am not sure. Beyond that, there are a lot of interesting ideas in this book and they are explored well, and mostly with an ambivalent viewpoint, allowing readers to draw their own conclusions, and avoiding the morality monologuing some authors can get into. The character work is inconsistent. The main character stays fairly flat, but given her nature it feels right to me. I loved Lt. Awer and her development, but many of the other supporting cast either lacks much depth, or develops in ways that don't feel true. This is another book that I feel deserves a dive into the later offerings, but would be weaker if it were a stand alone. 

**Illidan** by **William King** - I never have huge expectations for media tie ins. I was disappointed hard mode removed Star Wars, and I heard the new Thrawn books were solid. In the past I had read a few of the World of Warcraft novels, and they ranged greatly in quality. I also have experience with the world, having playing the original RTS games, and WoW itself through Cataclysm and a month or so of the Legion expansion. Burning Crusade being a very important aspect of my gaming experience at the time, I figured this book would be a good fit. Overall, the writing is solid for a media tie in. It is not beautiful prose, but it also has a nice flow and feels far more fitting for a novel than the fan fiction feel some tie ins can get. (I am looking at you Crystal Star, Children of the Jedi, and most definitely Splinter of the Minds Eye) In favor of it, I do like the exploration of the Demon Hunters and the view points that we get. On the other hand the characters outside the Demon Hunters and Illidan feel flat. For readers that have no experience with the universe, you will likely need to google all of the creatures and zones that they explore, because the book feels like it expects you to know them already. Depending on your view, that may or may not be a crisitism, it is a tie in to a well established universe. The only thing that did bug me was the first part of the book that just screamed ""HERE ARE WHERE ALL THE BC RAID BOSSES CAME FROM"", and a retcon that occurred, but those are minor complaints. 

**Destiny: Child of the Sky** by **Elizabeth Haydon** - ""I read the first book in this series for a previous bingo card that I never submitted and did not particularly enjoy it. For this time around, I figured I would finish it for two reasons. It is well reviewed, and I had no other series that I have not finished to do this. For this review I am going to cover the series as a whole, rather than just the last book. Mostly, the only thing I would state distinctly about the last book is that it could likely be cut in half and still hit everything that was needed. First the pros, I did like the magic system. While song, name, and element systems are not particularly ground breaking, I think they were used in conjunction well and really added to the story. The world building was solid, if not always clear and while I would have liked a bit more explanation on things (>!The dude with the eye drops around the dead star that can change time through film editing in particular, give me a series about that guy!<, it did add to the story, particularly in book 2. Unfortunately the cons for me are huge. To begin, I am not particularly a fan of romance, preferring it to stay as a side plot if anything, so this may just be due to my taste. However, I knew I might have issues with this book when the first chapter starts with overly flowery and romanticized descriptions of a 14 and 13 year old meeting, having sex (including a focus on the blood left on the cloak, you know, for purity I guess). Listen, I teach high school, I understand that kids that age have sex, but it is really not something I feel I need to read in the way described, but again, personal taste. If you are a fan of rape in your fantasy novels, this is the book for you. Rape and sexual assault is plentiful and its treatment ranges from framing it as vile as it is, to romanticising it in ways, with a healthy dose of """"boys will be boys"""" along the way, again not to my taste. Finally, the main character is just.... well you know the criticism the Kvothe gets in Name of the Wind, where everyone loves him and he is always great at everything. That is the main character here. If you want to have female lead for some wish fulfillment fantasy, go nuts plenty of that exists for male leads, but the dichotomy of the main character being super intelligent while also somehow being the most oblivious individual in existence can be frustrating. Literally the only thing that stops her from ruling the world and ending every problem in the series half a book in, is that she doesn't believe in herself, which is a problem when it is still the case at the end of a series. It has it's bright spots, but I think this is one where if you like the first book, the other two are more of the same, and not in a bad way. If you struggled with the first, then there is no point in continuing. 

**Six-Gun Snow White** by **Catherynne M. Valente** - I am still not sure exactly what I read. I loved it, but the last 10 pages hurt my brain a bit. Honestly not much to say other than try it. The Novella was the perfect format for this, I think if I tried reading a whole novel in this style I wouldn't make it through.

Hopefully I will have more for the next weeks review thread. Upcoming are Where Oblivion Lives for the reading club, Into the Drowning Deep, Slow Regard of Silent Things, and the Star Thief."

Finishing a series is satisfying, but also a little bittersweet, like a vacation you loved and are sad is over, but you are ready for the comfort of home. You might go back, see sights you missed the first time, but you know that while enjoyable it won't have the same magic.

Finishing a book in an incomplete series has its flaws, it's the cinnamon roll that you want more of, and you know there is some in the pan, but your wife will kill you if you don't leave her one, so you have to wait for the next time they are made. On the other hand, the possibilities are endless. You can spend time in that world, imaging the way the story could go. Sure you could do that with a finished series, but with so many things wrapped, maybe characters you love dead, you have to focus on secondary characters, great if you love the world, but rough if the book is character driven.
