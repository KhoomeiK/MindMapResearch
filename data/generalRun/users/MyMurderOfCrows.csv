AskReddit,fgf4wqn,t3_ey2of6,1580724611.0,"Given I am a pluviophile, rain would be the first and foremost scent.  It would be tough to decide from there but the smell of fresh books would be pretty far up there (similarly a fresh deck of Bicycle playing cards) followed by that fresh clean air you find in an untainted forest.  That sniff that kind of stalls your brain for a moment as it realizes what it is smelling."
TheSilphRoad,fgerfxc,t1_fger9kl,1580707428.0,"Yea =/ Controversial statement but... I won't lie, if I were rural, I would totally get why people spoof.  And I don't judge people who do since that is almost your only option to play he game and have a chance."
TheSilphRoad,fgeq909,t1_fgeq6cy,1580706346.0,Maybe if Niantic decides to make the research reward useful again....  =/ I feel for rural players after being in a small Ohio town for a week.  It was painful...

monopoly,ffz14j7,t3_evy63u,1580360605.0,My fave versionnnn.  I have played over a thousand games on it.  My main suggestion is using 2 regular 6 sided dice and 2 of the Speed dice.  Makes the game go much smoother =)  I hope you do get a chance to play!
