AnimalsBeingBros,fgn158n,t1_fgmrlbv,1580935692.0,"My husband, then boyfriend, came over right after I had my wisdom teeth taken out. And of course I passed out right away on his shoulder. And he let me stay like that for an almost full 12 hours until I woke up. Later on decides to tell me he thinks he has permanent back damage from it.... he could have simply moved because due to the amount of drugs I was on I probably would have stayed asleep.. but that’s just how much he loves me lol"
