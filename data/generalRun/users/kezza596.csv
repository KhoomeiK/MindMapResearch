Men on each side sang Christmas carols to one another, and eventually emerged from their trenches on Christmas day and shared food, gifts, songs and games. Both sides were also allowed to safely retrieve their dead from No Mans Land to document and send home.

Within 24 hours of sharing food and playing games, they were shooting at one another again.

Imagine peering through your scope and fixing the guy who shared his dessert in your sights, the man whose name you know, whose history you might know, his families names, the games he likes and his favourite meal. Imagine pointing him in your sights and firing.

AskUK,fe38qyi,t3_enl1qo,1578847018.0,"It's not as bad as America, but it definitely exists. I've never witnessed any in London, and I imagine that's because it's so multicultural, seeing/hearing someone from another culture is a daily experience.

However, here in Norfolk I've witnessed it a few times, but mostly it comes from a place of ignorance, not malice. I remember when we had a black boy join our school, he was the only black kid in a school of over a thousand, and people either avoided him because of his skin colour, or wanted to befriend him because of his skin colour. Kids asking questions like does he do a rain dance and things like that.

We have a very culturally diverse university, but the students tend to keep to that side of the city.

My Colombian friend has a very heavy accent, and he says he's been scolded multiple times by people to 'speak better' even though he's trying his best and clearly English isn't his first language, but no one will have the patience with him, and I suspect it's because he's not snow white in complexion, so people view him as less.

My colleague saw a car full of Eastern European people get out of their car and talk to each other in their native language, my colleague then said ""I hate when you get a car of foreigners pull up, bet they do well leeching off of our tax money"". All based on nothing but their race. He doesn't know their residency status, their job status, anything. Maybe it's nice to speak in your mother tongue so you keep it fluent. But based on nothing but a half second visual and audio cue, he judged them. They never heard what he had to say, but the racism was there even in a passive way."
