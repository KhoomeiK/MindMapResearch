MawInstallation,ffav458,t1_ffakrny,1579745196.0,"The definition of ""fatal wound"" in Star Wars is tenuous at best. Kylo could very well have recovered from that through non-Rey intervention. He'd already survived a blast from the Bowcaster, and being stabbed in the stomach by a lightsaber is not even close to the worst wound someone in Star Wars has recovered from. Anakin was ""fatally wounded"" and left burning, but Palpatine was able to recover him, and Maul was *cut in half* and able to keep himself alive and recover because he hated Kenobi.

Someone healing a cauterized wound by drawing on the combined power (I assume she unintentionally accessed the dyad stuff) of the two most powerful bloodlines we know of isn't the biggest death-defying force feat in Disney canon."
3Dprinting,ff7nwxv,t3_es33co,1579654073.0,"I see occasionally see Etsy posts on /r/xwingtmg for pretty standard looking 3D printer token cases and accessories. I have no idea what they make, though.
