But I grew up with a very Catholic mother and we had a priest family friend. I believe he was from the Dominican republic. He also did exorcisms and investigated reported haunting and possession.

He was awesome, and his stories were utterly believable. I have no first hand experience but I am not foolhearty enough to dismiss the possibilities of such things"

But I don't judge. Marijuana treats valid medical conditions and most governments have their own amoral reasons for keeping it illegal.

I had a dream, I went over and told him about it because it was odd, though mundane.

I dreamt he and I and my sister we're. Standing in front of an unfamiliar house, he and I were smoking cigarettes. He went to sit down, but a spider was on the chair. I mentioned he should just kill the spider and sit down.

He says, ""yeah, but Maria wants me to stop killing so much""..weird, but mundane. So I tell him about it. 

He assumes I'm testing him.  He had been dating my sister but they didn't tell me. He proceeds to come clean, yadda yadda yadda, I really love her...ok...

So fast forward about 2 years. They're now living together and I visit. We're outside smoking a cigarette..and, you guessed it. Spider, same exact conversation. We stop mid sentence. He meets my eye, and we just kind of freak out a little. 

I guess it could have been coincidental, but it matched exactly. Word for word. Same porch, same house, that was unknown in the dream ."
