footballmanagergames,ffnj0ht,t3_eu4lk9,1580066552.0," Pulling my hair out in FM13. Been playing the same save off and on for a couple years. 

Rangers. Won a few CLs, it's 2042. For about aways attacking rigidly with discipline in the back with a narrow waisted 4-3-3/4-1-2-2-1, defensive line dropped a tick less than normal. No assigned playmaker or target man. I have to have an anchor man because of my self imposed squad/transfer policy meaning I don't have the pure talent to just have 2 center halfs capable of performing continentally, the full backs barely keep up as it is. The past couple seasons the execution of my tactic is getting less and less effective, but the starting 11 who won 3 of 4 CL titles in 5 years is mostly still there and I have probably even better midfield talent now. 

It started a season or 2 ago, with the anchor man beginning to dump the ball behind him, the defense mindlessly cycling the ball around until they're pressed and either dump the ball back for the keeper to boot up, strongarm the press and pass it to the now far too deep midfielder, or lose the ball and defend again, which isn't much of a threat until I hit Europe where it's a huge problem. I gave the fullbacks instructions to get up to the half line and get it to the playmakers, but they rarely get it right.

The next thing that seemed to develop in the past couple seasons is that my two central midfielders who need to collect the ball in the circle and setup attacks and finish them too if needed simply aren't doing it. They used to be just fine, normally one being the chaser who can break forward and the other who's expected to make the right decision how to attack. But they aren't. So often they also simply cycle back possession, even though I give them the instructions and enough. I suspect ""often"" through-ball instructions for both might be affecting this, but once again it's all generally the same tactics that made my home-grown majority Scot squad a dynasty with mostly the same players and talent, I also think maybe due to the space from them to the forward makes them not see opportunities, but the striker is allowed to drop and collect, and I've got AMR/L that are within range and will make themselves available mostly as forwards but also playmakers. There's no real vacant space as an excuse, either way they need to either pass the fucking ball forward for the front 3 to attack or take it themselves. The only positive is possession, but as mentioned it's stupid possession not intelligent possession.

This would actually be just fine, because I have 2 world class strikers, both intelligent and skilled. One slightly more of a poacher/advanced forward, the other a bit more cerebral who's a step slower but has the skill and technique to make it irrelevant. Bottom line they are stars that can take on any defense in the world. Just get the ball to them they know when to play it through or go at the goal, there's ways to force it to them in any tactic, and I can force the midfielders up to clean up behind them or start another attack. 

What is pissing me off now, and why I wrote all this, is that this has all come to a head. I carefully conditioned and kept in-form (I know rotation can cause problems) my world class, highly capped first team (other than Scotland which is the squad focus I mentioned, I have 5 stars for France and Germany) for a big month of Real Madrid, Ross County (the only league match), Celtic, Celtic, Real Madrid. They weren't too impressive in the previous month, but the boys are professional and seemed to be acceptably focused. But every single match, not only did the rare and always flaccid playmaking happen, but when the plays did fall their way due to luck, they make the fucking worst critical decisions. My world class, 20 finishing, skilful, composed, intelligent, playmaking, gobs of goals center forward will dawdle  inside the penalty area when he can slam it in at multiple opportunities, or when there's a midfielder or free runner in a threatening position to break open the defense or both he takes the absolute most uninspired option. When the rare play goes right, for no fucking reason whoever has the option to finish it off or make the last key pass almost actively avoids it.

The entire team is actively avoiding every single opportunity for absolutely no reason. They're allowed to take reasonable long shots, but the absolute worst play that I'm about to erase this save over is the mildly creative move that my first team mid fielder correctly played and dribbled into the area, successfully getting himself into a space with defenders completely off balance and too late... and he doesn't shoot. 8 meters out, 2 clean seconds, no one to stop him or deflect. Acceptable intelligence, touch, technique, anticipation, all you need. Doesn't shoot.  Never seen anything like it. Just doesn't shoot. Why. No reason. Why. I don't believe I've ever straight up lost 5 matches in a row in this save (partially due to Scottish league being barely top 10 coefficient) not even if it's a tough run like this, but it happened and we deserved it every match.

I can't see any reason for this. I changed captains in 2040 to the legendary midfielder who practically singlehandedly drove us to those European finals and won the Ballon d'Or and he's not exceptionally brave, and I'm handicapping myself with the talent, and maybe I'm not telling some of the players to learn moves that would be better for this specific tactic, but like I said, there's nothing significantly different. The AI adapts to tactics, sure, but this isn't excellent defending or exploiting weak points, it just pure dickless football
