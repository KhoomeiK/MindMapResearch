There's no way to have known what trump would do in office.   I didn't vote for him, but I have to admit I felt a twinge of curiosity when it was announced that he won.  I mean, he's spent every day since then proving that nascent hope wrong, but there was no way to know what a shit goblin he'd end up being.  

The Dems rammed a smug Hillary down our throats like it was our fault for not liking her (at all), and gave us no reason to think anything would be better as a result.  Trump was at least different.  I was considering voting for different.

I'm glad that putting Hillary up there has destroyed that dynasty, and shaken establishment democrats enough to allow folks like Bernie  and Warren a real shot at it in November.  I think either of them could do a lot of good for this country and the world.

So sure, fuck trump and the whole republican coterie, but take your wagging finger and shove it.  Hillary would not have led us to a better future, she would have shown us that ""this is just how it always is and probably always will be because who can do anything about it"", whereas trump is so awful that it's frankly motivational.

 Maybe trump is the pearl harbor we needed to  get off our asses and finally get about making things better."
