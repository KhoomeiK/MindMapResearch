You agreed to them and and yet you and your family are breaking them. You need to have a firm talk with your family and let them know family event are not going to involve the ex. If they still invite her over, they are simply being disrespectful of your wife. Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if your wife ends up going no contact with your family with the blatant disrespect that is going on.

If you see your ex at a family upset, YOU need to get upset. Lead your wife away from the event. Don’t just get pulled along. Voice your anger, support her."
