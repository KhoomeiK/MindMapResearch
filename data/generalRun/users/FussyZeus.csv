sadcringe,ff6feaa,t1_ff5yc0l,1579626004.0,"There's a lot of emerging science that points to most forms of addiction as some kind of self-medication, based around the people who didn't fall into severe opioid addiction, who were mostly well socialized and had abundant healthy relationships, were financially secure, and were otherwise healthy people who seemed to resist otherwise incredibly addictive drugs.

Ergo, the new studies are pointing out that, while certainly some addiction is a result of the kinds of people predisposed to substance abuse, that a great deal of addiction is actually down to the circumstances surrounding ones life. And if you think about it, that makes a lot of sense; if you're miserable in your day to day existence, you'd probably find a lot of comfort in the bottom of a bottle, or in an empty pack of cigarettes, or the tip of a needle full of heroin. If on the other hand you're generally happy, healthy, and secure as a person, then you'd probably just indulge in all manner of substances as recreation, and be far less susceptible to becoming an addict.

This is also supported because it dovetails nicely with why something like Alcoholic's Anonymous has worked; the spiritual aspects aren't what does it, it's that you have a routine gathering of people you feel safe enough with to talk shit out. The power that social traditions have to enhance human life is very downplayed in our modern world, and it's to the detriment of everyone. We are social animals; it's part of our biology. It's wired into the cores of our brains. We are not meant to be alone and so much of our modern world makes us feel very alone, very often."

I wouldn't even say it's necessarily good behaviors gone amok, so much as it's the result of an ideology and set of spaces designed to foster thoughtful critical thinking. When I watch Contra's content and many other breadtubers, I'm invited not simply to rage at whatever they may be upset with, but to consider how it affects me, those around me, and society as a whole. It's not about directing blind fury; it's about inviting your audience to **think**.

You're right, and good on you for thinking them. Here's some additional stuff you can fling at people who disagree.

One fosters discussion and criticism and feedback, the other doesn't. Why do you need to think when you already know everything? Why do you need to consider when you already understand it all?

>First I’m told that sexual preference is an innate quality that we’re all born with. It can’t be changed. Ok, cool!

Well, it often does change over time, but yes. You're entitled to your preferences in sexual partners, of course.

>But then give it 20 years and all of a sudden sexual preference is  something that’s programmed into us after birth, and we’ve all been  brainwashed by the media to find this person attractive or that person  attractive.

The media does inform a lot of what makes us seem attractive or not, at least when you're talking ""fashion model"" beauty versus what we tend to find attractive to us in natural, animalistic senses. For most people, what is attractive usually lands somewhere close to what it started, but it's important to not discount the effect media has on people either relative to beauty standards.

Either way though, regardless of where you fall, you're still entitled to your preferences. Your preferences just may exclude a lot of the dating pool for you, but you're entitled to them. The way unrealistic beauty standards impact society is a lot more of a ""you're hurting you"" kind of problem.

>it’s racist to not sleep with anyone non-white,

I would say the line between following your preferences and being a racist is simply that if you seek or don't seek out a relationship with someone of a given race due to stereotypes about that race. So; if you're one of those guys who want Asian women who are submissive, or who seek out relationships with black men because of wanting a sense of danger, that's racist. If on the other hand you're just not attracted to people of a given race, I don't find that racist at all.

>and it’s transphobic to not sleep with a trans person.

Again it depends on the context. Most transpeople's problems in the dating scene amount to men (and occasionally women) who feel they've been ""tricked,"" otherwise known as trans-panic. It's easy to write this off as some baseless fear, but this stuff has gotten a lot of transpeople hurt, and killed, over the years and the people responsible have avoided jailtime entirely or at least gotten reduced sentences using this defense in court.

Still other people actively seek out transpeople for sex, but not for dating, without making that clear because again, of fetishizing them as people; seeing them as an exotic, non-normative collection of sexual organs and not as people, which may not make you a transphobe but certainly makes you an asshole.

>THEN, they tell us it’s fatphobic to not sleep with fat people,

This, however, is bullshit in either direction because fatness is not innate. However, I will say that exclusively dating fat people because you think they're ""easier"" or ""desperate"" does still make you a huge asshole.

>How does someone who genuinely wants to keep up with this crap, not to  be “woke” but to at least be sensitive and supportive, not piss them  off?!

FTR I hate the term ""woke."" It's godawful. But the answer to your question is just that, treat people like people. If you find yourself not attracted to a person, then don't approach them. Or if you've found out a bit into a date, just be honest and kind. Nobody ever likes being rejected so it's never going to feel great, but there are plenty of ways to let people down easily. If someone plays an ""ist"" card when you do so, if you've done so in the most polite way possible, then just accept that this person is in pain, is speaking out of anger and hurt feelings, and that this statement in no way aligns with you as a person.

One thing to keep in mind is that, especially with regards to very marginalized groups like transpeople; they get rejected because of who they are a LOT. And even if you assume that all those rejections were delivered in a polite way, which they almost certainly weren't, but even if you assume that, that shit hurts.

In my mind this is not unlike a body when you're trying to lose weight: a body \*can\* burn fat at any time, but it only \*chooses to\* under certain conditions, i.e. lower caloric intake, regular exercise.

You go through enough experiences in life you start to understand that all those things you say you believed get more complicated when it's actually something non-hypothetical that you have to make the call on.

The first time around our kitty had fluid in his chest cavity. We were told it would be thousands of dollars to even diagnose, with little chance of kitty coming home either way and we elected to let him go. It was the hardest shit we've been through as a couple.

...until the second time. Not the same symptom of course but much closer than I'd like. This time we were determined to find out, and spent like I said a good two and a half G's on the poor fellow, not including gas taking us about half an hour south to the actual animal hospital, not just a vet.

So a week of missing our kitty badly and he came home for another week, seemed to be doing alright, then nosedived. We had no official diagnosis; they'd narrowed it down to a few possibilities which ranged from ""definitely will kill him"" to ""he might live, but not very well."" And then we put him down too.

It's easy to say ""I'd do anything for my animals!"" but it's harder to sign on to spending a used car in vet bills knowing that their quality of life will be at best, pretty badly impacted. In those situations I wouldn't judge people no matter what they did; deciding to put him down was just as hard as it was to put his predecessor down. It just sucks, the whole thing sucks and in my ideal world, no one would be forced to make such terrible choices."
ChoosingBeggars,fdkx1ps,t1_fdklzib,1578512923.0,"It's not nearly this cut and dried. We had a cat pass away because we were broke 20 somethings in college. Then, years later when we were much more financially strong, we had a cat get sick and we were determined to not lose this one for the same reason.

$2,500 later we buried our second cat not even knowing what went wrong.

I don't really begrudge people who put their animals down when they get sick. Treating animals is fucking hard, often really fucking expensive, and the results of said treatment can mean either a fixed pet, or a corpse, or anything in between. And if they're going to die either way, it can also make their final weeks some of the most unpleasant of their little lives, for both them and you.

In short: it's complicated. In my mind if you can afford to feed and home an animal, you should be allowed to have one. Anything past that is sort of... well, let's hope it goes okay. But I wouldn't deny someone animal companionship for not being able to front a few grand for an operation."

LeopardsAteMyFace,fcshxsf,t1_fcs0qo5,1577916847.0,"The people who support them may not be willing to publicly admit it, but this is exactly what they want. The people who aren't ""true believers"" but vote R anyway are too galvanized against any Democrat candidate to vote for them, they'll either vote R, or not vote. Mainstream Democrats rule this stuff out as conspiracy theory. Liberals and leftists know this stuff, and try and explain to the other groups, but are shouted down because of the above reasons.

In short: Why hide it? The people you need either want it or think it's a joke, and the people you don't need aren't making progress on explaining it to the other people.

Edit: Thinking about this more, I don't think most leftists really appreciate how ""stuck"" most Republicans are. They've heard, most of them their whole lives, about how the immoral left is going to destroy Murica. They have an entire life's worth of friends, family, job contacts, coworkers, all of whom are most likely Republicans. Leftists tend to forget that they're essentially asking Republicans to change teams, after said person has spent their whole life shunning the ""others"" they're now being asked to join.

I say this from experience: I still haven't outed myself as a Leftist to my family. My father will likely disown me if he ever finds out. My mother will probably be okay. I'd lose a good number of my old school friends, and already have had to distance myself from a bunch of communities online and offline because of this.

You're essentially asking people to destroy their entire social network to join ones they've been propagandized from since childhood, and on top of that, oftentimes former Republicans aren't exactly welcomed with open arms into leftist spaces either.

And then people wonder why no one wants to convert."
