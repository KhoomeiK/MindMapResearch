datingoverthirty,ff7l72h,t3_ersyud,1579652185.0,"I canceled one in maybe like 2 minutes once.

Invited the guy to grab a drink. I mention this place that's great and not too far for my place and he answered something along the lines of ""good, this way it'll be quick if we want to get right on to fucking"". I was so grossed out by his wording that I didn't even bother answering and unmatched."
Tinder,ff7ke94,t3_ervj7n,1579651630.0,"For a moment I thought you brought your date to L'Astral 2000 and was like... no wonder you got friendzoned there haha!

Great spots though."
dating_advice,feizf8l,t1_feh62xn,1579151587.0,I always look at how my date interacts with waiters - it tells a lot about a person.
dating_advice,feiyxol,t3_ep4cow,1579151161.0,"“I’ve been with girls like you before and it’s never worked out.”

I still don’t know what a girl like me is but I cut the night short and I guess I’ll never find out because I sure as hell don’t plan to ask him about it!"
dating_advice,fehhmve,t3_ep6u8h,1579116717.0,"His happiness doesn’t rest on your shoulders. You can’t stay with someone because you’re afraid what breaking up with him will do to him. You’re no longer happy in this. Your happiness means as much as his does.

Cut your losses and break up. We fall out of love. You’ve been together five years and you’re 23, you’re bound to have changed in the meantime, same with your feelings. It happens."
dating_advice,fegn7s9,t3_ep2d6q,1579097805.0,"You’re definitely not ready. You just want to replace your ex, and it isn’t fair on that girl at all. Take some time for yourself to go through things before you can enter any relationship"
askwomenadvice,fef7a3k,t3_eoksuf,1579049859.0,"He has a girlfriend, which is why he won't schedule a call on one of his days off - cause he's with someone else. She probably discovered your thing which is why he blocked you, or he just decided he felt bad towards her and decided to be a coward towards you.

In any case, it sucks for you and you'll find better than someone on the other end of the world who won't give you the time of day."
dating,fdho6ff,t1_fdgtrsl,1578426791.0,"Age groups were supposed to be broken down 25-35, but it ended up being 25-29 (because of demand that night, I assume) - usually they’ll advertise that.

Some girls wore dresses and some guys went for the suit and tie. I wore dark jeans with a classy top - like I dressed up but I was still casual, which is very much how I tend to dress in regular life. As long as you don’t look like a slob, you’re good. 

Good luck!"
dating,fdhnghr,t1_fdh8lja,1578426364.0,With taxes it ended up being about 25-30$.
dating,fdhndvb,t1_fdhksko,1578426320.0,"Thankfully, looks aren’t everything.

The most attractive guy there was full of himself and condescending. I spoke to three girls after and we all declined him. The second most attractive guy and the personality of a paper sheet. I turned him down.

My guys all looked good, but were not the most attractive guys or my usual type. I was charmed by how it felt with them."
dating,fdgolon,t1_fdg2krx,1578404116.0,"If you’re replying to me like this and you’re still single, that’s probably why! 

I’m attractive and get matches, yes, but nothing is ever that easy in the dating world."
dating,fdg0mye,t1_fdg0hly,1578375738.0,The event I went to had limited places for women and men so it was equal.
TaylorSwift,fdg0ff7,t3_ejvv3y,1578375541.0,Please. As if I Forgot That You Existed is about anyone else...
dating,fdfze03,t3_ed2v7m,1578374587.0,"I just went to one and enjoyed it. Super weird, but I matched with the two guys I felt a connection with. Try it!"
dating,fdfz91d,t1_fdfz2cc,1578374462.0,"Google search speed dating and your city - if you live in a decent size city, there will probably be events at bars."
depression,fdaev7k,t1_fd5pfmx,1578245262.0,"Broken up or not, if my friend slept with my ex-boyfriend, I would cut her out of my life, no explanation needed. You can’t do that. Shitty friend."
relationships,fdae6xq,t1_fczeor7,1578245108.0,"I always make plans with friends there too, but I might start sleeping over at their place more when I visit. Not a bad idea. 

Thank you!"
relationships,fcxiokb,t1_fctgta4,1578063899.0,I hope it gets resolved.
relationships,fcxin2l,t1_fcuqzqe,1578063871.0,"In theory, that’s a good idea. However, since I live away from them, I don’t exactly have this luxury of just walking out like that every time."
relationships,fcxievy,t1_fctvkme,1578063710.0,"I stayed a little longer then except and left after lunch. They were fine yesterday. Maybe the message was understood and that was their peace offering? I don’t know. But next Holidays, it will be a smaller visit. This was excruciating."
relationships,fcxi9f3,t1_fctf5yg,1578063602.0,I think unfortunately next Holidays I won’t be staying too much. Better for my overall state.
relationships,fcxhwxt,t1_fctevha,1578063352.0,I kinda feel like I do have their happiness resting on my shoulders sometimes - it’s a little bit much.
relationships,fctef6r,t3_eit8fd,1577940627.0,"Why don’t you go on your trip another weekend? I get that it’s nice to do it on the exact anniversary but it’s not that big of a deal. Also, you’re the one who can’t take more than 2 days off."
depression,fcl75s2,t1_fckqqod,1577741268.0,"I don’t quite know what to tell you but it will get better. If someone broke you, stop contact and focus on getting better because you deserve better. Sending lots of love. <3"
dating_advice,fck2jg8,t3_ehjc6t,1577714648.0,"I’m so, so sorry this happened to you.

You ditch him and you report him (if you want to). I encourage you to report him because it IS sexual assault.

Try to go to a pharmacy/clinic today."
depression,fck25r9,t3_ehl4ep,1577714311.0,"The fact that you did get out of your place and are on your way to work is a small victory. Never forget to count those.

But man... the coffee... I felt for you in that moment. No way I could have gone to work without my morning coffee."
depression,fcibwdr,t1_fcb358w,1577660279.0,*hugs* I’m really happy it made you feel a bit better. It did for me!
dating,fcg257j,t3_egxdcc,1577635829.0,"I went on a brunch first date twice and they’re fun! I only recommend that you drink coffee before the date just to be awake lol.

It’s more casual, generally you’ll have made plans for after the date because you’ve got an entire day ahead after, so you don’t linger and ask yourself the odd question “if we continue this do we go to his place or mine?”"
freefolk,fc98pdw,t1_fc8n2i9,1577548814.0,I’m French Canadian. My parents are currently watching season 8 and I can attest that that’s how they pronounce her name.
depression,fc91v0w,t3_egpdqp,1577545681.0,"I think you need to start seeing yourself in a different light. No one has zero bright spots. Find them, build on them. Your post is very negative (which happens a lot when you have depression) but you do have a job - you may not like it, but you have a job and an income. That’s something to be proud of.

If you’re not happy with the way you look, go to the gym, put on make up. You’ll start seeing results at some point and you’ll see a shift in your confidence.

Lastly, please don’t shut down people who want to help you. I’ve seen you do this on this post, and it seems like you were pissed at your grandmother’s reaction as well. I think you’re afraid of help at this point. You don’t need to be rude to anyone - you need to be open to it, to welcome it. If you’re closed off, there’s nothing we can do, and people won’t want to help you.

I used to be you. You CAN get better. You CAN feel good about yourself. You CAN turn things around."
dating_advice,fc2t16m,t1_fc2p82w,1577373201.0,Automatic swipe left here too. How hard can it be? I also assume it’s a fake profile
depression,fc1t5qx,t1_fbzvxko,1577328909.0,"It’s never been about that for me. My parents have always been careful with money and I’m so grateful for that, they paid for a lot of lessons but didn’t shower me with gifts at Christmas or on my birthday. I remember one Christmas, my ex-boyfriend’s parent gave him 1500$ + gifts and I was like “......wait what?!?” - they weren’t rich or anything at all. I always found that so odd."
