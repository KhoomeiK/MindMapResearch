Oh most of these such churches do services as per the BCP, they just use massive and extraneous service sheets and bulletins, essentially reprinting the whole service in a booklet, so none of us pew-sitters even have to look at the BCPs in the pews (anecdotal evidence gathered from other frustrated high church pew-sitters having a gripe online, so possibly somewhat exaggerated).
