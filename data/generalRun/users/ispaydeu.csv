Read last sentence below Source: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sundevil

“Operation Sundevil was a 1990 nationwide United States Secret Service crackdown on ""illegal computer hacking activities."" It involved raids in approximately fifteen different cities and resulted in three arrests and the confiscation of computers, the contents of electronic bulletin board systems (BBSes), and floppy disks. It was revealed in a press release on May 9, 1990. The arrests and subsequent court cases resulted in the creation of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The operation is now seen as largely a public-relations stunt. Operation Sundevil has also been viewed as one of the preliminary attacks on the Legion of Doom and similar hacking groups.[1] The raid on Steve Jackson Games, which led to the court case **Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service, is often attributed to Operation Sundevil, but the Electronic Frontier Foundation states that it is unrelated and cites this attribution as a media error.**”"

If your dog is actively chewing on plastic then your car isn’t a safe place to be. First there is the obvious risk of choking on a piece of plastic that gets lodged in the throat. But what about the toxins, plastic isn’t meant to be ingested. I suppose now your going to claim that when you dog eats a 5” piece of an emergency brake that it doesn’t swallow any of it and also brushes its teeth to get it out of its gums followed by a good flossing? ... nope it still gets into their stomachs in some quantity. Do you have any Tylenol or ibuprofen or any other medicines in your car? You will claim you don’t but likely in your center counsel or glove compartment or side door panels there is, so what if your plastic loving dog eats that? Also when did you last check under your car seat and remove whatever gross stuff you forgot about under there that could also kill your dog? Being “ok” doesn’t make it “safe”... love your fido and keep them safe no matter what. Dog lives matter... Even if there are no laws concerning pets in hot or cold vehicles, animal cruelty charges are a possibility if a pet is put in harm’s way and one person walking by your car and watching your dog hack up pieces of plastic everywhere could call and then your charged. PS Hypothermia can become a risk at 50 degrees.

Damnthatsinteresting,fdfjuto,t1_fddr32b,1578363401.0,Built to a higher quality so things like this don’t happen? It takes one half turn to the left of both knobs and it opens. That kind of half turn play in a knob will result be in it being played with by people and slightly turned. When people pull on a round object towards their body they don’t do so on a perfectly perpendicular motion. The wrist will naturally twist inward as the object gets close to your body resulting in a natural 1/4” turn occurring at your finger tips as you pull the one t to you. It’s natural. If you think about it as you do it you won’t do it but normally when you pull an object towards your body and you get close to your body your wrist will turn inward. Do that couple times and you’ve achieved a half turn....

But I don’t want to be a buzz kill but if the administration from his hospital stumble across this they won’t take kindly to their employee recording videos and appearing on social media. It might not be good for him. You could even get your brother fired. Hospitals have employee policies about pictures and videos being recorded by employees and that it’s prohibited. Yes it might be difficult to make your brother out from the video but anyone familiar with that area of the hospital and the department employees that would be there would figure it out quickly. If this gets popular enough they will find out and figure it out and he will have to answer for your decision to post something that he was doing against policies. Do him a favor and take it down. Then later on a few weeks from now you can tell him you screwed him over and also you saved his job at the same time...

And after capturing images of himself with the world’s largest mammals under the water – he was thrilled to take this extra special picture above the water too.

He said: “The photos are a dream come true for me.  “I’d longed to swim with blue whales all my life – it was such an unforgettable experience.

“The whales were swimming past quite quickly, we only saw each one for a few seconds before it swam off, so I was very lucky.
