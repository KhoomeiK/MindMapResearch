casualiama,ff9h3ki,t3_es6r04,1579712883.0,I read this before taking a nap and I've been thinking about it since. I have a neighbor that was doing something similar but I was able to talk her out of it and explain to her how it was a scam. Your Grandma seems more difficult. Perhaps you could schedule sometime with a police officer that would be willing to sit down and explain to her how the scams work. That way it's an authority figure. Tho her refusing to ask the desk for help or talk to you about things shows she knows deep down it's a farce. She wants to hold on to it anyways because she's lonely and this is the most a man has paid attention to her in a long time. At least that's my 2 cents to it.

lastimages,fe3qb9d,t3_enhseg,1578851838.0,I'm so very sorry Op. I've had All my teeth removed because a fabulous genetic feature my mother passed to my sister and I. They are both missing all their top teeth. They crumble apart like a meth heads teeth. Something to do with how they grow while still in your skull as a baby. Idk. This was always one of my biggest fear when one of them would crack open. I had molars exposed for months. Finally got accepted to a dental grant that pulled them and gave me dentures. That in itself was a horrible experience. Glad it's done now. Thank you for making people aware this is a terrifying possiblity.
