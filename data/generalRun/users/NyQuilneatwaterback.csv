Eat two donuts as fast as you can, rest 30 seconds, eat two more, repeat five times. Also, try to squeeze in one long donut sesh a week. eat 20 donuts, but space it out over several hours."

running,ffn7xca,t3_eu23cm,1580062958.0,"You should never ever run through bad pain. At that point you're exacerbating the injury, and it's just going to take longer to heal. To get back running, you're going to have to take some time off. Id honestly think about more than two days. To get back running, you test the waters with a literal five-minute run. If there's any of the old pain, stop, like really stop. Dont hurt yourself more. Next day, try it again. Also, this is why you see so much advice about increasing mileage slowly. It's fun to push your limits, but it's just so easy to get hurt. you really got to train smart to stay running.

Also, you might want to try some foam rolling and stretching."
