BariatricSurgery,feza0u0,t3_eqyy6j,1579455197.0,"It's hard enough to deal with the depression and powerlessness that goes with the flu when you are at a steady weight.  Throw in the hormonal changes going on after surgery and you have a recipe for serious sadness.  Rest and fluids and electrolyte replacement  (broth, gatorade) is really all you can do for yourself.  I had SO many sinus infections the year after surgery I can relate SO well.  It's been over a year and I'm stable with my weight now and my health.  It is totally worth it but you are going to have to rest and bury yourself under blankets."
