SwainMains,ffpgp85,t1_ffpggdg,1580094612.0,"Not necessarily. Lucian struggles at sieging, which is a big aspect of why we have adcs at all. You win by killing the nexus, you do this by breaking turrets. Lucian cant siege for shit with his low range, and his ult becomes very weak if the enemy have a juggernaut or tank stacking armor. I see far too many Braum Lucien duos stomp early game then fall off a cliff in usefulness as Caitlyn or Xayah get their items."

SwainMains,ffpge5m,t1_ffpfxzn,1580094396.0,"Easily my second least favorite adc after Ezrael. The only thing worse than someone who only can deal damage, is someone who only deals damage and falls off late game."
SwainMains,ffpg6u3,t1_ffhti2b,1580094251.0,"Her ult is also semi global, and a huge denial tool. Thats extremely important in such a dragon focused meta. Taliyah is never more than an R key away from any major fight. Swain isnt."
SwainMains,ffpg31j,t1_ffio2fe,1580094176.0,"Swain Support was like this for most of last season.

E, Passive, Auto, Electrocute, Cheap Shot, Scorch, Spellthiefs is about 40%-50% of an ADCs hp at lvl 1. More in practice, because your adc will ideally also auto attack as well. Your ability to burn potions and put on the pressure level 1 is very impressive."
SwainMains,ffpfwep,t1_ffpeee2,1580094046.0,"Swain support in a nutshell.

Your best adc buddies are ones with reliable cc of their own. Jhin W, Ashe W/R, Caitlyn Traps, Senna W, etc. They land anything and your combo is basically guaranteed."

SwainMains,ffpcijb,t3_eufvek,1580091625.0,Twitch with ten death powerspike. Seems accurate.
leagueoflegends,ffp4ljg,t1_ffohu7z,1580086099.0,"Yup. Everybody gangster until they stuck in chain cc. 

It's like the thor meme. ""I can't beat you."" 

Queue the jungler charging in as Malz has his R ready. ""But he can."""
leagueoflegends,ffp4f9n,t1_ffns8ze,1580085978.0,Burst is high in practice because they blast your ass with cc. Something most adcs lack in spades.
leagueoflegends,ffon0en,t1_ffogf21,1580079373.0,You tell that straight faced to someone auto filled on jungle in masters. They will get invaded 24/7
leagueoflegends,ffnoxvn,t1_ffn8wes,1580068749.0,Bingo. His healing is also post mitigation. It's easy to stonewall him with a bramble vest tank. Ornn becomes almost impossible to deal with after a few armor items unless his jungler helps Aatrox bury him
leagueoflegends,ffnon3j,t1_ffmncoq,1580068626.0,"He draws enormous amounts of pressure in a bot lane meta. 

Which is better? Camping the 0/5 Aatrox to get your 4/0/2 fiora even further ahead? 

Or camping the living fuck out of bot lane. Taking dragons and obliterating the bottom side of the map. 

Look at the Hashinshin games he wins where he is cosmically feeding. Generally he has a bot and mid and that miles ahead due to his jungler. They're up dragons and he himself, even feeding, is basically just a block of meat the enemy focuses while his Carrys do all the damage."
leagueoflegends,ffno9e3,t1_ffnbw06,1580068471.0,Except it's not skill so much as burden of knowledge. Jungler needs such a width and breath and knowledge to stay current on their meta. Most of their decisions are made by accessing what information they have available and acting on it. Not necessarily insane micro outplays
leagueoflegends,ffnntyp,t1_ffmikp0,1580068297.0,"Bingo. A Q1 E W combo sets up his W pull, and requires a dash or a movespeed buff to escape. It also sets up his Q2 to land. That's a very solid trade. He can then all in or disengage."
aww,ffneipp,t1_ffmb0jo,1580064914.0,They do. After they've dulled them. They eat a lot.
aww,ffkexpr,t1_ffjxhny,1580021644.0,His motorboat purr says otherwise
SwainMains,ffjnuxj,t3_etyzgz,1580002581.0,"Atm the birds appear until you land a W. Then they disappear and only reappear for the ""ravenous flock"" when a W lands."
SwainMains,ffj8anz,t3_etrecq,1579992844.0,"Very viable. Works great with any ADC with cc. 

Your best combos are: 

1: Jhin. Your main man. You can root off each others roots with either his W or your E chained into each other. You can assist him in ult kills by W'ing a target slowed by his ult shots. Your combined ability to lock down targets with roots and stack souls off that will burn enemy flashes easily and help you scale into a midgame powerhouse. 

2: Ashe. Her constant slows make landing your combo easy. Let her W slow the enemies, and lob your E at them. Between your W and her E you have a lot of vision control to safely check for ganks, spy on enemy jungle, and keep tabs on dragon. Your level 6 all in is also gross with Ashe R, Swain Passive E W Q R. 

3: Caitlyn. Her long range poke and traps make it difficult to bully her early. If the enemy does dive, post 6 your R makes you ideal for fighting them off. Anyone who steps on a trap suffers a Swain passive, E, Q combo as well as a Cait headshot. Also your W can give her vision for some really long range R shots on people trying to back in bushes with 1hp. 

4: Draven. A very very aggressive lane. Its feast or famine. You can passive pull of Dravens E, and his aggressive plus your ult means any landed cc can result in running the enemy down with overwhelming damage. A kill heavy lane, you should have ample souls and rush Zhonyas to help draven tower dive by juggling turret agro for him."

leagueoflegends,ffi3qsh,t1_ffhx2sf,1579964217.0,"In the past camp Hashinshin was a viable jungle strategy. Except hes used to that. Meanwhile drag is way too important to ignore all game to keep farming an 0/5 aatrox because your buddy is playing fiora. 

So the other jungle just leaves Hashinshin to the wolves and gets mid and bot ahead while securing dragons and this all helps close out the game. 

Hashinshin isnt stupid. He can squeeze every drop out of his gold starve hard camped champ if he truly wants to win. He'll split push and draw pressure or throw his life away in a key fight if he knows it'll offset how much the enemy uses to kill him. 

He's the human personification of top lanes low overall impact in the current meta. Camp him and sow your own defeat."
