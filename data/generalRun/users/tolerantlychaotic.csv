There's all sorts of absurdity in your comment here. You can like some black people (who agree with your politics) and then use racist epithets against members of the same group of people who happen to disagree with you or do something you don't like. It's the logic of ""my black friend/neighbor/coworker is one of the good ones,"" while ""those people are [insert epithet/racist euphemism here]; the ""I have a black friend"" mindset is racist, too. 

And ""easily be regarded white in most countries in the world that dont subscribe to the US' mind boggling one drop rule"" is absurd, too. Because countries that don't have US history don't have much of a concept of ""whiteness"" to begin with, let alone whether Valerie Jarrett would be considered ""white."" But other countries do have ideas of nationality, ethnicity and shades of skin color, and in a European country, Valerie Jarret would probably be considered as having ancestry from some minority within the European majority (though probably not framed in black/white terms)."

videos,ffjn9qq,t1_ffjmiid,1580002185.0,"> only thing that matters in judging a person is intent

The only thing that matters is judging something that is almost impossible to judge? Intent may be very important in a hypothetical sense, but in a practical sense, it's fairly meaningless, and anyone can dismiss their hurtful words as simply not their intent (regardless of whether or not they're being honest about their intent). 

The thing that matters most is how many people are hurt by something you do, and how badly they're hurt--that's visible measurable in a lot of ways. You as a person should re-evaluate your approach if you're saying/doing hurtful things. If it turns out you barely (if at all) hurt a very small minority of people with an ill-formed joke or a misunderstanding, then a small apology or explanation and moving on. But if your words are repeatedly super racist (and not even funny) as agreed upon by a wide consensus of people, then you might want to revaluate yourself, your words, your demeanor, etc., apologize, hold meetings with the appropriate groups to express your remorse, and evolve as a person.
