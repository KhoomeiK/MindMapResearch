I'm not a fan of hard sells either, by they way."
todayilearned,ffdpe59,t3_esulcd,1579825809.0,"One of the biggest problems for both salespeople and consumers, is that in 2020, consumers doubt their own judgement.

They do not complete purchases because they do not trust themselves to make the right decision. 

I could show you the best product in the world that you absolutely need, and you could still say ""I'm not too sure, I'll think about it"".

A lot of sales tactics these days are, or should be, geared towards instilling confidence that it's okay to say 'yes' and to buy something - providing the right price etc ticks are all there."
todayilearned,ffdauis,t1_ffcvpxf,1579816880.0,That's probably one of the most awful things I've ever read. Far out.

The panels used, would hopefully be superseded by new technology within a 1-5 years, panels would then hopefully be replaced after 5-10 years with something more efficient and of better tech'. 

Panels would not need to last 25 years, the same way a PC can, but doesn't need to.

I'm not for this company or idea, only solar in general."

They had to create a lobbying arm as their charity was found to not be impartial. 

It's funded by oil companies and people with ties to the oil industry. You're hilarious."
IAmA,fe0dbd8,t1_fdzz1ix,1578810644.0,"You need light only, not direct sun.

Current solar technology along with quality storage is more than capable of sustaining the worlds energy needs as of today.

If we had even a year of massive capitalist investment, we could scale down the amount of infrastructure needed."

If this money is money you don't need, keep it in there, you can use it on your next bet. The key to gambling is setting limits, betting with a cool mind and not being too rash with any decisions made.

  
Hope this helps."

The write up should contain information that backs your pic, not to be used to influence anyone. Perhaps that was the reason you faced criticism?"
