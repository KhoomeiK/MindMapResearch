""how was your day sir""
I notice I am terrible at explaining these things because I am just the MASTER at talking myself in or out of anything I want.
But the base of it is to show empathy so that the conversation can start on a good note.
The best response for any opener is to ask how was your day since no one gets to ask them that.
People looking for excuses no one looking for making other people's day.
Simple
People don't care how much you know, until they know how much you care.
So I said How was your day officer
it was good thanks for asking, do you know why I pulled you over?
yeah I was going 60 on a 35, I apologize
yeah? what was going on there
Simple ______________ this is where you tell the truth 
The officer I didn't get a ticket from looked like the most typical white officer that was going to give a ticket whenever since he literally hides in a spot.

Isn't it crazy how there is 1 world, but within that world, there are 7.5 billion worlds.
One world that meant the world to you has just ended,  Honour yourself. Love yourself.
Suicide isn't selfish, suicide is just suicide. The feeling of hopelessness was just toos strong for him that felt there was no way out.

teenagers,fcappl4,t3_egsnm8,1577574107.0,"My only advice is that in reality there is life and then there is death.
Both are inevitable once life has started.
My biggest advice is when you wanna cry just start crying.
You can be learning history 292 about hitler or whatever but just start crying whenever you think about  your cat.
The crying part  really helps the mind heal itself, noe one should ever NOT cry.
Crying is one of the most beautiful emotions in the world.
It means you are relieving a big stress that you weren't ready for and that you could'nt handle.
You get better and better at crying and you really will become the best version of yourself and things will just look like a past.
Your cat is in heaven waiting for you dont even trip."
relationship_advice,fcam29a,t3_egncd1,1577571927.0,"Let me tell you something about something.
In a relationship the way it starts is as best as its going to get. 
When you first date someone if you were deutche pay or he fully pays that all makes a big difference because that means that is where the standards are met. Thankfully you aren't in too deep I would personally just cut your losses and walk away from the relationship and the biggest thing you should take away from this relationship is that it doesn't get better when it comes to your boundaries or whatever you wanna call it so create them the right way."
leagueoflegends,fcak23w,t3_egt9lt,1577570715.0,"TIL this vanikas guy who posted this thread hasn't made a single bad comment on league once, if anything he is veneikas CHRIST because he is cetegorizing toxic players and he isn't part of that group.
I will be the first person to let you know I was toxic af when I was 15 it all comes with what you are doing and league doesn't help that considering it is such a competitive game and people can get too ahead of themselves.
Keep riding that white horse venikas <3
WILL THE REAL VENIKAS WHO IS A SINNER JUST LIKE ALL OF US PLEASE STAND UP xP"

This life is tough so its just a PSA for everyone,
League will not help you with whatever you are dealing with.
GO outside figure out what you love to do and do that with a passion so much that time will just go just as it goes when you play league.
RIP Maria."
