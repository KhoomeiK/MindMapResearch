A yolk is designed to spread a load evenly down your center of mass while providing a perfect handhold and keeping the center of gravity for the weight low. A yolk is also fairly rigid and predictable. 

With a man, the weight is unevenly spread, without a proper hand hold and the center of gravity is much higher up. The weight is also loose, and somewhat unpredictable. It'll shift as you move.

Military,ffb83wk,t1_ffapews,1579754587.0,"Apart from a higher quality receiver, and a higher quality barrel, the biggest difference is the sight.

The ak-47 has the rear sights mounted on top of the gas piston housing on top of the receiver. The RK-62 has it mounted on the rear of the receiver cover. That doubles the sight radius, enhancing accuracy.

The Gas tube is also dovetailed into the front trunnion and gas piston with a cog shaped ring. Which makes disassembly easier, and helps isolate the piston movement from the barrel. Which improves the harmonics, and thus, accuracy.

The result of all that is a rifle capable of an accuracy greater than 1 Moa. As opposed to the 4-5 Moa a standard Ak-47 is capable of.   1 Moa is roughly 1 inch at 100 yards or 2.54cm at 91.5m

Either way, i don't think we'll have a truly HD experience until PCs become powerful enough to run 8k HMDs or something. And even then, it would need to be 90hz+ because slow refresh rate=sickness.

My guess is it'll probably be 9 Gpu generations, before we get there.

Currently, in project cars 2, the 2080ti is capable of roughly 784 417 997 pixels per second at high settings. 8k vr 90hz would require 5 971 968 000 pixels per second at high settings. 

Unless i'm mistaken we've been getting roughly 25% more pps per generation. So it'll take 9 generations of compounding gains to achieve 5 844 369 508 pps. 

My math is almost certainly wrong because you can't predict the future by comparing history, and i'm not accounting for future optimisations, or low-medium graphic settings. I'm also assuming we need 8k to remove the screen door entirely. If 5k is enough for example, we would only need 2 654 208 000 pps. Or 6 generations."
