StarWarsArmada,fg7kx1v,t3_ewu3fk,1580595011.0,Correct. I find their website pretty unreliable.
StarWarsArmada,fg7kui5,t1_fg7kt48,1580594961.0,Yep.
StarWarsArmada,fg7ksf0,t1_fg7kqn4,1580594921.0,"Ya, I was just there. They had 3 on the shelf"
StarWarsArmada,fg7kpkf,t3_ewu3fk,1580594866.0,I saw those in JJ's... ;)
apexlegends,ffwscjk,t3_evnwxo,1580309847.0,"I suppose it depends on how good you are, but I highly doubt it considering there’s leas than a week till the new season."
canadaguns,fftgwlz,t3_euzg55,1580220208.0,That Goldeneye watch is so sweet! I want one.
StarWarsArmada,ffgofj3,t1_ffgnem5,1579911015.0,"Ya, the cards are key. When people sell ships its expected they sell the cards and upgrades with them."
StarWarsArmada,ffglrpx,t1_ffgkt36,1579909184.0,"I wouldn’t worry to much about availability - there is plenty out there, you just need to dig a little. And a lot of people recommend buying lots from people to start your fleet, but if you don’t want second hand that’s fair.

Also, the rumour is a lot of the ships will be reprinted and distrubted to vendors in the next couple months, so now might be a good time to get into it. That way, when ships are rereleased you’ll have a good idea of how the game plays and what you want to get.

That being said, I’m fairly new to the game. More experianced players may have a better idea. Hope this helps."
StarWarsArmada,ffg6u6i,t1_ffg18zx,1579899712.0,"Yep, I ordered last thirsday and received it this wednesday."
EatCheapAndHealthy,fffphgj,t3_etagcg,1579888971.0,"Brown sugar, cinnamon and chia seeds (with a pinch of salt)"
StarWarsArmada,ffffti5,t1_fffdykc,1579883030.0,"No problem at all, and thanks for the gold! I was surprised they were showing - it pays to check back every few days."
StarWarsArmada,fff9eiw,t1_ff9ktj6,1579878957.0,Psssst... I was just checking that site again and they were in stock. Go go go!
StarWarsArmada,ffacsxc,t1_ffac4lc,1579732512.0,"Very nice, congrats to you too! Ill be cracking it open tonight - hopefully my buddy is available for a quick skirmish."
StarWarsArmada,ffa7xhi,t1_ffa27e6,1579729625.0,"I just got mine, so you’ll probably have a better idea of how they play then I do."
StarWarsArmada,ffa7p2o,t1_ff9znb5,1579729495.0,"So, uh, my bad. Didnt realize it was a video game at all lol."
StarWarsArmada,ff9qmpz,t1_ff9p3xr,1579718836.0,"Lol hey man, have faith! Just keep an eye out, Im sure they’ll pop up again."
StarWarsArmada,ff9ksh3,t1_ff9kjei,1579715094.0,"I picked it up on greatboardgames.ca, though it looks like they’re out of stock now. I also got the light carrier from them about 2 weeks ago, so they seem to be worth checking back at every now and then."
StarWarsArmada,ff9jjgv,t3_esf3e1,1579714356.0,"Ooooh, that looks fun! PS do you have a link to the battle mat?"
StratfordOntario,ff5y4ie,t3_eri76x,1579614032.0,Welcome! I'd recommend hitting up the farmers markets on Saturdays! I Think it runs from 7-11 am or so (though I may be wrong). Good place to get some local groceries for the week :)
AskReddit,feru78v,t3_eqh39b,1579358390.0,Tyson.
StarWarsArmada,feko363,t1_feknv9h,1579204078.0,Are you local? If so I’ll help younout if that does happen (I dont have that yet either)
StarWarsArmada,fekmkt9,t1_feklmbh,1579203177.0,"Thanks for the tip! I was just able to order one no problem. We will see if it gets cancelled or not, but I have high hopes. :)"
StarWarsArmada,fekia7j,t1_fekhsuv,1579200615.0,Canadian retailers? Do go on...
StarWarsArmada,fejspx1,t3_epdygj,1579184917.0,"I'm in exactly the same boat. I was lucky to get a bunch of ships from 401 right around Christmas, but they seem to have been pretty much cleaned out since then. If you're near KW, JJ's cards and collectibles has a few ships in stock. And I was able to find a quasar at  [www.greatboardgames.ca/](https://www.greatboardgames.ca/) just a couple weeks ago, so there are a few gem's still kicking around out there."
StarWarsArmada,feh6qvj,t3_eoyqqv,1579110310.0,"Good to know. Im in the market for some new brushes, so I’ll take a look. Thanks!"
aww,fegwskw,t1_fegp5lt,1579104280.0,"\*Edit

Dogs are too pure for this world."
StarWarsArmada,fegwe6k,t1_fegvwpc,1579104025.0,"Thats fair, and those are good points. I only ask because I painted my outrider and YV-666 the other day. While I’m pretty happy with how they turned out, I found the small details like panelling and cockpits very difficult with the brushes I used. Any recommendations on good quality brushes?"
StarWarsArmada,fego5l4,t1_feehcwq,1579098502.0,Nice. I just got into the game over Christmas and ordered a bunch of stuff from 401 games as well - they definitely seem to be the best resource for us Ontarians at the moment.
StarWarsArmada,fegnkrd,t3_eoyqqv,1579098075.0,"Incredible. My eyes feel strained just looking at this. 

Is there a specific type of brush or tool you would recommend for such small detailing?"
StarWarsArmada,fe9vgmg,t1_fe9ms7d,1578941797.0,"Thanks for that - bookmarked! I'll be sure to refer to that next time, cheers."
StarWarsArmada,fe8zp7t,t1_fe8rlmt,1578932662.0,"I have the same problem  living in Canada. The actual price of the items isn't bad, but with exchange, shipping and customs, it gets out of hand pretty quickly."
aww,fdnhs9k,t1_fdneew9,1578586087.0,I hope we’ve all learned a lesson today...
StarWarsTheories,fdnh10f,t1_fdk2ifu,1578585626.0,"Doubt it. Like [AverageJoeAudiophile](https://www.reddit.com/user/AverageJoeAudiophile/) said, the loss of the first death star would only strengthen his position on the subject of super weapons. 

That being said, I think the fact that the Rebels are successful in blowing up DS2 strongly suggests that Thrawn is still off in the unknown regions during the Battle of Endor. If Thrawn was around after the first DS was destroyed, surely the Emperor would be more willing to give him the TIE defenders he so strongly advocated for. And if Thrawn was active in that period with the resources he actually requested, I feel like the Rebellion would have little to no hope."
aww,fdlbcpr,t1_fdlar46,1578520400.0,I'm glad I wasn't drinking anything while reading this - that was a super vivid and hilarious description.
AskReddit,fdhv4cr,t1_fdhuxmc,1578430691.0,A man of culture.
StarWarsTheories,fdhez20,t1_fdhaewg,1578421234.0,"Totally agree. He actively promotes the TIE Defender program as a far more effective alternative to a giant superweapon in both ""Thrawn: Treason"" and ""Star Wars: Rebels."""
StarWarsArmada,fdgsug0,t3_el6m5n,1578407439.0,"Good start! A big step up from the plain unpainted minis. Stick with it, you'll only get better."
StarWarsArmada,fdgsr55,t3_el08wx,1578407373.0,"Ok, now you're just showing off. Amazing line work, and I love the colours! Seriously, I am in awe."
aww,fde9pci,t3_ekkfe7,1578334263.0,"Seriously heartwarming. It's always amazing to see acts of empathy and selflessness, especially from children. Sounds like you're raising that kid right."
StarWarsArmada,fdch17w,t3_ek8bdr,1578274694.0,Goddamn. Now that is what I call a nice setup. Enjoy!
