memes,ffw11hi,t3_evgid2,1580279885.0,"Butter was the best of us all. Butter was more than a lizard, she was a caring friend, someone to look to for inspiration, and a symbol of hope and optimism for a better future. Her perpetual smile was an icon of goodwill and love, her scaly skin a reminder that we are tough enough to withstand the cruel and uncaring world, her yellow glow a beacon of warmth in a cold society. Her death was a tragedy, an attempt by nature to destroy our spirit, of unconditional love and hope, are truly but her patronage of r/memes reminded us of her ideals, of her message. This final betrayal means that these ideals of strength and compassion, that messagedead and forgotten. We have succumbed to the cold and dark of society.

RIP Butter, may she live within our hearts."
