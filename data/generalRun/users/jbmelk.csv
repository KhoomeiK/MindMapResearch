My grandmother has been in a neurocare centre since I was born, due to a brain hemmourage she had suffered whilst hoovering. I never knew her before then but she’s still living across the ocean in my home country, with me being scared every night that due to things like Brexit and tory politics, her NHS benefits are being decreased. It scares me. I cry about the sheer possibility of losing her. Every time we visit home and have to go back to America, I cry. I’m a stereotypical hard-nosed and comedic man. Not the type you’d think cries. I’m crying writing this. 

The point of me sharing this is because I want you to know that there are people out there who experience grief all the time. It’s not easy to get through. My strategy is to cry through it. Cry at school, work, in bed, wherever. She wouldn’t want you to go through with it. This is commonly used, and often isn’t fair to suicidal people to blame them. But that same grief you’ve got, it would make things much harder on the rest of your family. I’ve been there, when my biological father tried to stop be from going home for a week, I spent half of my school day crying in the principal’s office or in class. The other half with my head on the desk feeling worthless or in the toilet using my keys to cut my arms as hard as possible. I planned on driving to the nearest bridge and jumping. Luckily I didn’t. Imagine if I had. My mum would have been distraught. My sister, friends, and adult support system torn apart. My mum would have had to tell my grandmother (who has difficulty communicating and motion, but not comprehension) that I had died of suicide. The person who I had almost killed myself because I wouldn’t be able to see her would have been devastated. Luckily I didn’t jump. Luckily we fought him in court and got a restraining order. I got to see her the next month. 

I cried of joy. 

Think of your situation. Your mum won’t come back. But what about your future kids? Your family. Friends. If you’re religious, imagine her finding out that you had died by suicide and an angel in heaven had to come to tell her. 

Please don’t. It doesn’t seem like it right now but allow yourself to grieve. Your family loves you, I love you, everyone loves you. <3."

SuicideWatch,ffxnd7k,t1_ffwxgzp,1580328644.0,"Maybe try another therapist? Three months listening to the same stuff week after week then switched to a proper psychologist and after three sessions I’m two weeks clean of self harm and cutting. 15 days ago I didn’t think I could nor did I want to make it to the next day. I am now on the road to recovery and doing my best in six months. It may not seem like it now but if you hang in there tomorrow will be better. You’ve already made it through 100% of your worst days, meaning you’re a warrior and have fought through those tough days to get to better days. I’ll be meditating for you tonight, I hope you find the help you need and I love you. <3"

toastme,ffhdg02,t3_etcu91,1579930810.0,"Life isn’t easy. It really isn’t. People fuck with us, and our brains fuck with us. But I’ll tell you what. These lines are taken from an inspiration of mine that kept me going. You’re a BAMF; Bad ass mother fucker. A BAMF is someone who’s made it past 100% of their worst days. You might have come close, but you still got through yesterday, you’re getting through today, and you’re going to get through tomorrow. That means you’ve still kept your 100% track record, not a single day that you have lived through, have you not made it to the next one. You’ve got people who love you, as many people tell you this, who will miss you. I don’t know you but I wish I did, because two weeks ago I had wanted to die and couldn’t get myself out of bed. I’m 1 week and 5 days clean of cutting, I never thought I could stop. Point is, no matter what your problems are that made you attempt, personal, familial, financial, you’re so fucking strong you battled through those issues, and have had a setback, but who doesn’t? You failed at dying but you’ve SUCCEEDED at living, and you’re a success for that. 

I hope I’ve helped you man. The world loves you, I love you. Good luck on your journey. <3 Sending love my friend."
