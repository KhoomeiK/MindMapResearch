SuicideWatch,ffbgqqz,t1_ffb1mht,1579764560.0,I haven’t forgotten. And thank you for checking on me. I appreciate it. I still struggle. Everyday. It comes in waves. I have a few good times then get knocked on my ass by something. It’s been worse of late. Just a serious throw down every day as to whether I want to be here.  But I’m still here. And I plan to keep that trend going. I have a goal tomorrow of making an appt with a shrink.

SuicideWatch,fd0mgy7,t3_ejjdgq,1578120878.0,"I’m days away of my 40th birthday. I went through college after HS because that’s what was expected. Got married. Had kids. Was breadwinner for the fam for 15 yrs. Had a mental breakdown last year. Been fighting mental illness and suicidal thoughts (active, I’ve always dealt with passive) for over a year now. Kinda feel dead inside. No passion. No hobbies. No big reason to live other than the guilt of leaving my kids alone. Going back to school to try and do something I like a little better, but again, no passions. I feel you, OP. Life is worth living, or so they say. Find someone or something that may give you the courage to live the way that feels best for you. Don’t worry or feel guilty about what others think or how they’ll feel when you’re gone. You don’t owe anyone your life but yourself. I wish you the best of luck. At least with a degree it’ll be easier to do different things, even if it’s not in your field of study. If you ever want to talk about little stuff big stuff bullshit life death pets whatever, I’m happy to listen."

I’ve attempted a couple of times and nearly pulled it off, same way as your father. But I AM getting help. And this does more to pull me away from the edge. I have a couple of boys and I don’t want to put them through this, even when I sometimes think they’d be better off without me."
