fatlogic,fgt4tjk,t3_f0bwxb,1581099064.0,Just reading this gave me a sugar headache lol
fatlogic,fgsjvee,t1_fgqt5pb,1581086173.0,"OOF same. I cook my leaves in water, mix with an egg and spices and some water and microwave. 2 cups of spinach and 1/2 cup green bell pepper, 1/2 onion per egg, it's the most calorie efficient way of eating veggies I can stand because I hate raw veg."
fatlogic,fgnznmb,t1_fgmihf9,1580956439.0,Yes! I remember the first time I noticed washing my hands that there were bones?? Under the skin?? Wack.
fatlogic,fgm48qv,t1_fgm2uvj,1580917709.0,"To be fair, no one should have to be hungry all the time. It's impossible to function in daily life like that. But the solution to that should be to create a small but consistent deficit (like us short ppl do lol) and add exercise if you can, not give up"
fatlogic,fgkxkz2,t1_fgkx0tn,1580876041.0,"Do go, better to be safe than sorry later"
fatlogic,fgksyl2,t1_fgk7a1k,1580872915.0,I'm 5'2. 1200 is a defect of less than 400 for me on a sedentary day.
fatlogic,fgje2nk,t1_fgij2g8,1580842105.0,Same. Actually gonna have to try on jeans before I buy them.
fatlogic,fgfjj7h,t3_ey2yvm,1580740467.0,"I deal with stress by eating and major loss by not eating at all. Neither of these things are healthy!! Though, yeah if it's temporary no long term harm done. You should deal with your emotions eventually though."
fatlogic,fgbic2w,t1_fg9ch1z,1580662407.0,"Your comment is giving me disordered eating vibes, ngl. Of course it's fine to dislike the feeling of bloating/water weight, but it'll go away. If there's actual fat gain, you can lose that too. No need to panic about it."
fatlogic,fg78iao,t3_ex7f2f,1580586483.0,"I happened to change schools so that my friends at my new school  never knew me at a higher weight. What's weird is that my old friends would never talk to me about weight, diets they were on, etc. The new ones will discuss stuff like that with me, but not with another girl in our group who's heavier. It's not out of malice or anything, just to avoid awkwardness I guess? It feels weird.

Also, I've been told twice that I have pretty hands, which is something I've always wanted so that's nice. Kinda sad to think I might have gone my whole life without discovering this about my body."
fatlogic,ffk1y1k,t1_ffj77rr,1580013317.0,Congrats dude. 8 years is a long time.
fatlogic,ffi6ucv,t1_ffi0qcd,1579966632.0,"Dude, we're not looking for figures rounded to four decimal places. Estimations are fine. Long term, it balances out. Much better than no counts at all."
fatlogic,ffi6ip0,t1_ffi1l1e,1579966396.0,"Good luck! One of my closest  friends also struggles to maintain healthy weight, so I know it can be hard."
fatlogic,ffhgr9z,t1_ffffh2c,1579934545.0,"To be fair, a lot more people than underweight ones are ""dieting""."
fatlogic,ffhgl7c,t1_ffgfub3,1579934341.0,"Cheetos and Oreos. Ah, yummy junk, so delicious yet so bad for me."
fatlogic,ffcugge,t3_esucfr,1579807495.0,"Anyone know good ways to prepare green peas? Without oil, preferably."
fatlogic,ffa6s4r,t1_ff9g4zt,1579728984.0,"I'm the same way, but it's hard because my mom and other older family members  will spout fatlogic. I try never to start an argument about it but it does get irritating."
fatlogic,ffa64y7,t3_eshfgz,1579728629.0,Imagine my surprise.
fatlogic,ffa5qn3,t3_esif8n,1579728412.0,"Maybe I will,  eventually. Maybe never. Right now? No. Lol."
fatlogic,ff98ii5,t3_es6gf2,1579707298.0,"Ugh I would know this was Ragen even without attribution. She has this weird revolutionary scientist shtick going on. No, Ragen, you're not the next Galileo.
Just because people disagree with you doesn't mean you're right."
fatlogic,ff93biq,t1_ff923pt,1579703817.0,"Huh. Something like that sounds pretty useful if used occasionally. Like I enjoy food socially, but on normal days? Satisfying hunger with minimal fuss sounds amazing. Pity it isn't available here."
fatlogic,ff64ziq,t3_err750,1579619261.0,"About the 98.7% thing, yeah maybe a lot of food has natural sugar, but it's added sugar that's a concern. That's not in food unless someone puts it there."
fatlogic,ff3sszu,t1_feypbwn,1579548081.0,Fatfreevegan?
fatlogic,ff3shum,t1_ff1643w,1579547891.0,Congratulations on your progress!
fatlogic,ff3kch3,t1_ff3hqqe,1579542888.0,"I may be understanding wrong, but it doesn't say how much she burned? Just that she's allowed to eat back  only 40% of whatever she burns."
fatlogic,ff2ljiy,t3_eqtmpn,1579511841.0,Saw this in the wild. Person asking was a kid.
fatlogic,ff2l2k6,t1_fezv8wv,1579511145.0,Thank you for the suggestion :). I did end up making homemade ketchup with fresh tomatoes. Happy because it only has stuff I'd normally eat as well.
1200isjerky,fetzrwm,t3_eqdbxa,1579381678.0,11/10 brilliant advertising.
loseit,fetr8z5,t3_eqdrwc,1579378765.0,"Stopped halfway through my slice of (very tasty) cake I was having with my tea because the cup was empty and I wasn't really hungry anymore. Put it aside and ate the rest about an hour later.
Scale victories are one thing but this. Having food literally just be food. No eating quickly so I can have seconds. No finishing my plate if I don't want. It's like a weight off my shoulders."
loseit,fetpv1l,t1_fetmtn0,1579378156.0,"I took a month off after 20 lbs lost before starting losing again. Burn out mostly, and it coincided neatly with an important exam too. I'm glad I did, it was good maintainence practice and it's easier to maintain my deficit  after. But maybe don't do it if you feel like you'll lose momentum and it won't be easy to get back into it?"
fatlogic,fese1l8,t1_fers8h2,1579364226.0,"Nah, I'm Asian. I did  put tomatoes on tomorrow's grocery list, so hopefully I'll have some less sweetened ketchup soon."
fatlogic,fescvt7,t1_fes53nt,1579363947.0,"You're right I have the taste buds of a little  kid. I do try to add new tastes and spices often and now I eat all sorts of veg and stuff I wouldn't before, but still the  foods I most enjoy are stronger salt/sugar/sour toddler flavors. Hopefully over time I'll learn to appreciate more complex flavors as well."
fatlogic,feromha,t3_eq1ksj,1579356560.0,"Ketchup is my weakness. I'll be having a relatively healthy meal of plain chapati, salan, piece of fruit and then add a pool of ketchup on the plate. It just makes the taste so much better. I work in the cals, but still. Maybe I should make my own? Control the sugar being dumped in at least? 


Also I now get how lactose intolerant people still have ice cream and cheese. I shouldn't be having citrus or caffeine because I get acid reflux easily. Had an orange and a mug of tea today :("
fatlogic,feqrdvp,t1_fepekmz,1579345152.0,"Oh that sucks. Happens to me too if I haven't eaten sugar for a while, then eat relatively a lot of it. Can't enjoy stuff like ice cream as a treat. :(
Something savory instead?"
fatlogic,feodygy,t1_feoaolo,1579298775.0,3rd looks pretty normal weight to me. Upper range of healthy maybe. So still 'thin' to FAs
fatlogic,femyd1l,t1_femdw0y,1579272770.0,"That's true. Along with the fasting part, we're encouraged to do good deeds and especially give to the poor. But Ramadan is what taught me that fasting doesn't cause weight loss unless you combine it with CICO lol. IDK why these people think that everything people do in relation to their diet is to lose weight."
fatlogic,fdx37c6,t1_fdt29a7,1578764819.0,"Anorexia has weight as part of the criteria for diagnosis. If you're not underweight, it's atypical anorexia. But yes, all EDs are serious and people should have access to treatment for them."
fatlogic,fdx278z,t1_fduql3c,1578764563.0,"You're right. I read somewhere that people with atypical anorexia develop heart problems just like people who have anorexia. Both are serious diseases, and doctors don't diagnose  EDs for fun."
fatlogic,fdpvlrj,t1_fdo6838,1578642319.0,"This exactly. As soon as I actually learned what CICO was, I stopped gaining and then started losing weight. The rest is just mostly fine-tuning."
