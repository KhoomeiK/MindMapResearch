dragonage,fffxl02,t1_fffs8oi,1579894005.0,"It was m first playthrough, and so I went in with pretty much no intentions or plan. I just made a character that I thought looked good and was going to do the things I thought were best, and I'd see how characters interacted and go from there. I met Dorian in Redcliffe, and maybe it was a bit of myself showing up in my Inquisitor lol but I'm a Zevran girl, I love his sass and confidence and everytime I play Origins I romance him. Dorian reminded me of him, so that was what I went with. Since then I've made characters specifically to see the romance stories of all the characters in the game, but Dorian madey first playthrough feel meaningful and I find myself always at the least befriending him because of that."

I'd played a friendly, curious, warrior human who until that mission had seemed very standard Do Gooder protagonist. Sure, he made a joke here or there, and I'd liked him. The fall of Haven was shocking and my inquisitor made it feel big and important, but the dance at the end of the ball was truly full of feeling. After that my inquisitor made friends with all the companions, developed a sense of humor, faced hardship with the siege of Adamant - he grew, I became attached. It made the game for me, I think."
fatlogic,ffbzcnl,t3_esqqw3,1579787490.0,"I understand that people have been saying hearing compliments motivated them while they were losing weight, and I'm glad they had that. But quite frankly, your motivation to lose weight has to largely be internal. Draw support from loved ones. But don't expect strangers to be the backbone of your motivation  - that's unhealthy, too. Further, I'd rather slightly demotivate a person who is already committed to a healthy goal, than unintentionally hurt someone who might be struggling with sickness or trauma."

minimalism,ff9f6oz,t3_erz9ms,1579711711.0,"U/shadowsmith16 has some great advice. I'd also like to suggest that even though it sucks and it hurts to not have those sentimental items now, it's because you are a changing and growing individual. You own what you do now because at some point you appreciated those things. I'm sure you've thrown away things since that in the future you'll realize might have been useful or sentimental in a way you don't now realize.

The sentimental items are hard. I think they'll always carry a weight, because they have intangible value. But you must have kept some items from your childhood. Think about why those things specifically have stood the test of time. Somethings might not be able to be replaced, but I think you should reflect on why the items you regret getting rid of were important. Is it because the item had value, or because they represented memories? 

You obviously still remember the family trips, and you still have the relationships that gave those items value. When you regretting getting rid of things, try to remind yourself of that. If it would make it easier, are there things you could get now that would help you remember those sentimental items? That doesn't have to mean purchasing new things, if you have ecological or monetary concerns, it could mean finding old treasures your parents have held onto. Or maybe you can find items you need that will be reminiscent or symbolic of those special memories and items. 

Remember that if you do get memory holders to take good care of them in the future, but that if those items no longer hold the same meaning that it's ok to no longer want them. They served their purpose. Also, remember that you still have time to craft memories and collect things that will hold meaning. Just because you've gotten rid of important items in the past doesn't mean you have to in the future.

Finally, for the toys and books you enjoyed in the past, there's always ebay and amazon and other places. Some things are classics. Sesame Street will be around forever I think. And so you can think of it as an opportunity to give your children items that have value to you because they are the stories you loved, but they'll be in good condition for your children to leave their own mark on when they fall in love with a kiddie book and mke you read it so many times the spine develops cracks and the glue weakens or when they chop the hair off their dolls or accidentally break a leg off an action figure.

I hope this helps."
declutter,ff94l1e,t1_ff8iv4h,1579704697.0,"That is really good advice. We got a coat rack specifically because the closet we used to store coats and jackets in is right beside our front door (literally, they form a corner together and when the coat closet door is open, it would block our front entrance) so we would never put things back and they'd always get thrown over the dining chairs. Now we store off-season items in there, and use the coat rack for the seasonal items we use everyday. It's not instagram worthy minimalism aesthetic, but it works for us lol"
konmari,ff93avj,t1_ff8y0r6,1579703804.0,"Iirc, shared living spaces are supposed to be tidied together, or at least should have input from everyone who uses those rooms so we don't toss things that are important to others.

Also, Kondo herself has said that functional items that don't spark joy but are necessary should be kept. We should just appreciate their role in our lives and what they do to help us instead of their appearance or other qualities that make other items spark joy on their own. 

I think this is a great post, OP.  When my mom saw me decluttering my room, she asked me about it. I told her as much as I could, and I think my enthusiasm and cleaner room made her interested, and I explained the method as best I could. She didn't follow it exactly at first either, but her room now is so bright and happy that even, or maybe because though it's very much her own space, I feel her happiness whenever I enter.

konmari,ff3z8s1,t1_fewh1gu,1579552094.0,"This is a really good answer. I'd also like to point out that the categories that are presented in the book - especially clothing and books - can often be stored in one area. So perhaps I've tidied all of my clothing - but I'll store it all in a closet as I now can keep all my clothing in the one area. I donated 190 books, and suddenly all of them could fit in the bookshelf in my room, complete with some decorative items. It's a good feeling to be able to show progress in one aesthetic little picture.

Further, komono is such a broad category that I think sometimes you have to focus on an ""area"" so that you can effectively tidy a category of komono. Maybe ""kitchen"" because you'll tidy your dishes, cookware, and tupperwate, then because you see progrss you'll role into spices, and maybe your cleaning closet is nearby so you'll wrap up with cleaning products. It doesn't mean the entirety of komono is finished (and I don't think that komono can be done in a single day as clothing and books may be) but depending on your lifestyle and hobbies, you may have gotten through a large part of it by focusing on the categories of komono that may live primarily in one room."

SaintsRow,fefrh2j,t1_fe4p5jf,1579063058.0,"In my headcanons, I always assumed fame and less competition once the Saints ran Stillwater let the Boss get a little more comfortable and relaxed. I don't think they necessarily were dumb in 2, I think they had to prove a point. Like Maero said, the Saints had fallen apart. The Boss was starting over completely, only Johnny and to some extent Carlos even knew or cared about them. They had to show they were still strong and capable and deadly. Yes, Aisha died, but they weren't doing a great job hiding her, and they did try to rescue her. Johnny got hurt because they were trying to warm him - it backfired, but it showed concern for the person who was at that.point probably their only friend and the person they trusted most. Carlos died because the Boss got cocky and wanted to make a reputation move instead of something more decisive. I think that that also had an impact on the choices the Boss made in future games - part of why they were so desperate to save Johnny in 4, to some extent probably why they didn't want Shaundi to be involved in taking down the Syndicate. I think they thought she was too weak to be effect and was in danger.

But, despite making some bad decisions with terrible consequences, the Boss got revenge. They made Maero murder his own girlfriend, which was a power move, but it was also strategic because they were stealing from the Brotherhood at the same time. Imo, they needed to be firm and establish that they were, in fact, the Boss. Once that wasn't an issue, they could chill out and be a little more forgiving. But as has been said before, they've let things slide before and so even if Kinzie can be kind of annoying in a know-it-all little sister sort of way (at least that's how she comes across to me) I don't think she would have been in danger, even from SR2 boss.

For example, Shaundi was a prime source of information in 2. She tried to argue against being the lieutenant in charge of taking down the Samedi, and the Boss shut that down, but they also let her slack off and do drugs while they murdered dealers, stole drugs, and burned drug farms. In 3, Kinzie is the only one on their team who can help them the way she can. Imo, the Boss has grown since 2, but I don't think even if they were the exact same that they would kill her. Probably just scare her, maybe a lot. I think she would have gotten very similar treatment to Shaundi or maybe Carlos. 

I will point out that MATT would not have survived the Boss as they were in 2. On edge and needing to prove themselves, they would 100% have murdered him quick in 2, which would have been a shame. Honestly I like both of the little computer nerds."

SaintsRow,fe8vh89,t1_fe8j8x6,1578931488.0,"Honestly I loved the sense of humor from the first 2 games, and even the third had a lot of good moments. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Parachuting down into a penthouse full of strippers and gangbangers was awesome, and only improved by the line, ""Some asshole's in my pool."" It also very much reminded me of Johnny and the Boss taking over the underground hotel in SR2, especially Johnny casually explaining they'd have to ""evict the current tenants."" 

Imo, a lot of the gameplay was still enjoyable, and I liked a lot of the scripted events. I liked the Boss screaming out a random personal secret when they, Pierce and Oleg were under heavy fire from, iirc, the Luchadores. The Boss shouting that they love Jane Austen? Perfect, considering they burst out with that line about fashion in the first game! But I miss the variety of combat and walk styles we were able to choose from. I miss how personal each or the rivalries felt in sr2. The only one who really ""deserved"" us murdering them to death was Loren, who died in the first third of the game, and maybe Matt because he stole all our money and constantly messed with our technology. 

(On a side note, I liked that Matt didn't get killed. I headcanon that my boss was silent in Sr1 because he was scared of Johnny and he was determined to not make a fool of himself and actually wanted to make Stillwater a better place, even if, in his twisted mind, that meant a place under his law. Matt reminds him of himself, in the beginning. Scared and playing at being a big gun- although obviously Matt is a lot less intimidating and effective than the boss).

fasting,fe8rj84,t1_fe88gtu,1578929744.0,"Honestly it depends on the person. Some people will be supportive, some people will think it's strange but not care, some people will think that because it's strange it's dangerous and that they're attempting to help you, some people are bitter for whatever reason and don't want others to succeed. The people we surround ourselves with make a huge difference on the amount and type of support we receive. 

I will say that the people who are drawn to and stick with fasting are some of the most dedicated, disciplined people I've ever spoken to. They have to be, to overcome their addicted bodies' demands for fat, sugar, and salt at all hours of the day. Hunger can be very difficult to work past but they do. And that has to transfer over in some way to dealing with social pressure. 

Some people may be driven by eating disorders, but most people I see on this subreddit, and on plenty of forums, do IF because it works for them and they find it easy to maintain a healthy lifestyle. So many people post pics of huge meals showing they are getting in the necessary nutrients. Broadly there's a focus on health, which differentiates the IF community from pro-ED groups."

Why do I need notes from the biology class I didn't pass teo years ago? Who knows, but I made some sick doodles on like 3 pages so how can I possibly get rid of that journal?

She's viewed as either extremely odd or ""special"" by jut about everyone around her. She's seen people be happy - and be very unhappy - and I think she's simultaneously disillusioned with the world and hoping for a miracle. She wants to feel normal, and Bill the vampire brings that to her in the form of a silent mind. She can act normal with him - for awhile. She does cling to first love, but when she discovers he's cheated she drops him, and she's pretty firm about it, too. She doesn't go back. She constantly proves that despite being a human in a world full of monsters, she is competent and capable of standing for what she believes in.

dragonage,fdyghef,t3_en7sda,1578779562.0,"Sword and board is pretty fun in all the games.

Imo, though, the best combination is Champion and Berzerker. 

Champion abilities let you buff your own party and penalize enemy attacks. Berzerker is a solid choice as well since it buffs your health regen, though it's at the expense of a higher stamina drain and lowered stamina regen.

 I'll get pretty much the whole shield section, focusing on abilities that damage or stun opponents.

intermittentfasting,fcoxaqh,t1_fcoa7yi,1577844128.0,"We are the same height. You are now my role model lol but seriously congrats, that's super inspiring. My goal is to drop out of plus size clothing in 2020. It's so good to see others acheiving what I'm striving for. Really proves it's possible"
fatlogic,fcowehh,t1_fcn1cs2,1577843411.0,Really this is perfectly phrased. I want to copy that last sentence and paint it on my wall.
fasting,fclrdeh,t1_fclqrre,1577754613.0,"Lol I guess I meant 48. Like fasting for a full day between meals. I can totally understand what you mean. OMAD has definitely helped me significantly in a fairly short amount of time, and I see a fuller future because of it. I wish you luck with everything. You're already halfway there! Congrats on what you've accomplished."
BeautyGuruChatter,fclpb13,t3_ehnnwv,1577753179.0,"Strange. I check in on Elle's channel ever now and then. I really love her fashion videos, but I've never followed her very closely. This is just weird though."
fasting,fclp1ja,t3_eht22l,1577753000.0,Man I can only imagine how affirming it must feel to realize you can do so much. Did you do it for health? Weight or mental/spiritual reasons? That's seriously impressive. Idk if I could ever do that lol omad is about as much as I do but I'd like to try a 24 hour someday.
fatlogic,fckn6y8,t1_fckl378,1577728962.0,"I love Every Damn Day Fitness's retort to this, about how no one judges people for eating massive meals at restaurants or eating whole pints of ice cream after break ups or whatever, but if you try to bring a healthy meal to a party people will judge you sooo hard. In this social climate, it's inconceivable to work toward being healthy."
veganrecipes,fcj1q4f,t3_eh8y0o,1577675093.0,Omg this looks so good. Saving that recipe for later.
dragonage,fcbh2w0,t3_egr76y,1577586780.0,"I agree that new weapons and dual weilding would be very fun! But sword and board warriors became my favorite class because of Inquisition. In my opinion, what they do have is done well. I go Champion or Templar, depending on how much I wanna lean offense or defense, and I'm unstoppable. I've single handedly taken down a high dragon after Bull, Cassandra, and Dorian have fallen. I had to earn it by building up my passives, but that just made it feel all the more worth it and fun. I dunno. Just my opinion."
omad,fc23ru5,t3_efp77o,1577339233.0,"So inspiring! I'm so happy for you that you're getting healthier, congrats!"
