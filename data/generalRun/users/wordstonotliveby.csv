Don't support with your money taxis that have tampered meters. You **could** confront the driver, but just ask yourself if it would be worth it, when you could wait for another cab, or use Grab"
CCW,fgkevs8,t3_eyx0ud,1580863932.0,"This is what I do:

I use a regular kydex holster, and Velcro brand hook and loop fastener to make things stick. But I leave some allowance or clearance (using about an 0.8"" thick block of foam, or the belt clip on an OWB style holster) between the holster and the bag because, personally, I can't get a good grip when the holster is in direct contact with my bag.

This is going to sound really ghetto, but when my firearm flops around because the bag isn't rigid enough to support its weight, I use a clipboard or chopping board, trimmed to appropriate length, and this does the job.

Here's a picture of my bag

My batchmates came from different backgrounds, some majored in Philosophy, math, tourism, history, CPAs, a few were licensed medical doctors, and so on. So your course isn't a big deal as long as you meet the school's requirements to enroll."
CCW,fg5ap6c,t3_ewvq2j,1580522559.0,"I don't know how to get an edge in a gun fight.

My 0. 02 is just on the Apex trigger.

I had carried my Shield for over a year in nearly stock configuration, except I upgraded to night sights. I had taken a class, and put more than 1,000 rounds thru it. I realized, personally, that I was not a big fan of its stock hinged trigger, while it worked just fine, it just felt awkward to me.

 Last holiday season, I had some leftover money from my bonus and read as much as possible on Apex products. I decided that I would only change the trigger shoe and nothing else. So I got the curved Apex aluminum trigger shoe, and, for me, it is so worth it. Feels like I almost have a new gun. 

Since I did the install myself using YouTube as my guide, I was able to get an idea of what is going on under the hood. And I'm more eager to keep training with my Shield because I really like the new trigger.

So I think that if your budget allows it, and it's a well researched decision, why not?"

I'm very happy with my Howard Leight Impact Sport muffs worn over regular 3M earplugs. They didn't break the bank, and were a huge improvement over regular ear muffs. I double up when I'm at an indoor range. 

For my eyes, I wear glasses so it's a bit more complicated. I have worn my old airsoft goggles over my glasses. But they can fog up. So I recently bought contact lenses, and regular safety glasses from my local hardware store."

Regarding carrying, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/e84351/big_guy_apendix_carry_sitting_down_comfortably/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) was extremely useful to me, and I even bought the same belt that the author uses. I just wanted to add that what really helps minimize printing, for me, was that I can adjust my holster to ride lower and tweak its cant forward (basically the orientation of the gun to tilt).

Philippines,ffsh9t0,t1_ffr0wlu,1580181673.0,"Two types of police clearance, local and national. Which one do you need? They look the same, both issued by PNP, but some licenses or jobs are strict and you have to get the national one. 

Local you get from the police station at your local town hall or city hall. manual ang process from filling up the form, payment, picture and bio, then claiming. It took me 15 mins I was first in line. Bring a Xerox copy of a gov issued ID showing you live in the town where you are seeking clearance. 

The national you have to register online, full up your info and set an appointment. This type you may only obtain from select police stations, these are listed in the website when you set your appointment. Be patient kasi lagi down ang system nila, meaning hindi kaagad papasok ang payment. It took me 3 hours, the senior citizen next to me took 5 hours because the system is very spotty. After payment goes thru, you just take a picture and bios, then they print. Bring proof of payment, and an ID. 

Just to be safe, I'd go for the national

CCW,ffse234,t3_eutunr,1580179460.0,"Guy here. I'm just throwing out my 0.02:

I think carrying, whether on or off body, is better than not carrying at all. I think there's a safe way to off-body carry, and I don't see too much of a problem **if** you do it correctly. (that said, I agree on the general sentiment against off-body). But why not both? 

Personally, off-body carry is the *only* permissible method of carrying in my neck of the woods, under penalty of revocation of CCW permit (admittedly, sometimes I still carry AIWB because this is what I prefer, if I won't stay out too long in public or I'm just at home doing yardwork). 

When I have to, this is how I carry off-body:

 I have a shoulder bag, which I wear in front of my person. A shoulder bag has been part of my wardrobe for more than a decade, even before I started carrying. I take it **everywhere**. 

I've modified my bag to allow it to support the weight of my Shield and a spare mag, otherwise the bag sags with the added weight of my gun. I've modded my holster so that it sticks firmly to my bag, same place every time, and such that there is enough clearance so I can get a full firing grip on the draw. My gun has its own dedicated compartment. My gun is always in my kydex holster the moment its placed in my bag. My bag has a magnetic flap opening instead of a zipper, so it is very similar to clearing garment when I carry IWB.
