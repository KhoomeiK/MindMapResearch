gwent,fdlqhcm,t1_fdlocdb,1578530063.0,Meh. I dont like draws in the first round. I like playing the cards i craft and that means i play less cards.
gwent,fdkme29,t1_fdk2uf8,1578506561.0,He is probably way higher than 13. For some reason the game isn’t showing prestige.
gwent,fdkm9v1,t1_fdk0k5z,1578506489.0,Yea im actually level 98- prestige 1 (60 levels) + 38. Basically meta decks are really strong. There are strong ones for each faction so no matter who you have chosen you should check one of those out. Also knowing what cards and strategies are strong and having counters in your deck helps.
