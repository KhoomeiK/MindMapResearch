teenagers,fe0g8zq,t3_enk6cw,1578812932.0,"Shit, dude. There’s a lot to unpack there. First off: If they did commit suicide, it’s not your fault, and there probably wasn’t anything you could’ve done to prevent it. They also wouldn’t have committed suicide simply because you weren’t taking to them. There was definitely a main cause, like mental illness, social/family issues, etc. 

Secondly: There’s no proof that they actually did kill themselves. If they were getting professional help, chances are they brought up Tumblr once or twice. Tumblr is one of those sites that a lot of people who don’t fit in go to in hopes of making friends and talking about what they’re going through (like what S was probably doing). Sometimes that kind of thing is effective when dealing with that stuff, but sometimes not. My guess is that they either stopped using the site after their therapist advised them to, or once they started to recover from what they were going through, and no longer had a need to talk about it online. 

This is just a guess, and I’m only going off of the information you provided, but I think that’s the most likely scenario. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about that, or anything else."
