They were the better teams those games, that's how it goes sometimes. A few bounces here and there and the Patriots have no Superbowls. We should enjoy what amazing success we've witnessed."

politics,ffbc9d7,t1_ffb6lj9,1579759356.0,It does in the sense that it dissuades people from voting because they feel their vote doesn't matter. Low turnout usually helps the minority ruling party (aka GOP).

Patriots,ff5f21v,t1_ff550xu,1579590086.0,Uhh after this year that might not be helping his resume.
SelfAwarewolves,ff0qft5,t1_ff0of8a,1579471360.0,That's not my point at all. It sounds like you're talking about the scientific method and replicating studies. People are making predictions. Totally different concepts.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fendkom,t1_fen8zrc,1579282397.0,Obama didn't have to bail out the banks. He could have helped individuals. He chose the path of essentially gifting vast sums of money to the financial institutions (quantitative easing).

Patriots,fcypxjg,t1_fcya0x4,1578084685.0,Yes McDaniels is the oc. He's involved in personnel decisions much more so than Brady. Brady has even said this many times that he doesn't have much if anything with regard to personnel decisions.
Patriots,fcxs9os,t1_fcxo0xr,1578069679.0,"Something that I havent heard much about last week's loss is the fact that the Patriots went 5-1 in their division this year. That's pretty typical actually, even for good teams, to lose one or two division games. Of course this one happened at home in an important game but still that was the only divisional game they lost."

todayilearned,fcmf13b,t3_ehw3nm,1577772861.0,I lived with the actor Tony Todd when I lived in LA. He was the cheapest guy ever. The apartment he had was rent control and when I moved out I discovered I was paying the full rent. A few years after I moved out I heard his good friend Charlie Sheen and made up a story to get his old car restored on one of those car restoration shows. The story they told was that it was Tony's beloved dad's car and he thought it was stolen. Instead they fixed it up and surprised him. Of course he knew it the whole time. I think the Santa Monica paper even wrote a feel good piece about it. Never told anyone about this but it's a true story. Lost all respect for him after I heard they lied about the car story.
Patriots,fckejfb,t1_fck7fjb,1577723556.0,Hey our own Bill Belichick is a former browns (albeit the Ravens / Browns sect) coach. Let's not be too harsh.
Patriots,fckefqh,t1_fckdcwy,1577723490.0,If you think bb ever tries to lose in purpose you don't know anything about bill belichick. He absolutely tries to win every game. He's said exactly that many many times. He also has expressed he tries to learn from his mistakes. Perhaps that's what you're confused about.
