Maybe check out FAWCO.org, the Federation for American Women’s Clubs Overseas. See if there are groups in Romania she could contact. It is overwhelming (as you may remember??) to move to a new country. It helps if you have friends from home (as you do with other Romanians in the US!). 

Another thing that helps the transition is having an activity. Can she teach English? Does she want to study another subject? Does she have any hobbies that she could pursue more avidly in Romania? Or maybe start a new hobby, I’d she has any latent interests. I picked up painting. 

Also, make sure you address her seeing her parents. I missed mine terribly when we moved away, but family came to visit and we visited them and it helps to have in-laws nearby. If you are able to create a budget showing the financial practicality of living in Romania, make sure you include travel to see her family and maybe offer to fly them over once a year. Offer summers/holidays, whatever she feels she would be missing out on by living abroad. We always do thanksgiving in the US, for example. 

Lastly, if you are open to the idea, maybe offer a compromise. If you would be willing to live in other parts of Europe, at least you could see your father and family more frequently and enjoy the other perks of living in the EU that you enjoyed while you lived in Romania for a year. Maybe she would be open to starting over in a new place over moving back to your hometown."
