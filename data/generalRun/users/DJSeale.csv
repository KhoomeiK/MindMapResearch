SkincareAddiction,fez2s63,t3_eqx0hi,1579453333.0,"Don't listen to the people here, they clearly don't know what they're talking about. 

The oils on your skin play a large role in causing acne. Dry skin will often try to produce an abundance of extra oil to try to maintain the little bit of moisture that it does have. The extra oil helps prevent additional moisture from leaving the skin (trans epidermal water loss), but the oil can also clog pores and cause other problems. Thus, battling dry skin can do a great deal to combat acne, so don't listen to people saying otherwise. Moisturizer is a very important tool in addressing acne for a lot of people, especially because it makes your skin more receptive to any actives you might be using in conjunction.

However, to answer your question, this particular moisturizer is *very* popular on this site for a variety of reasons, but mostly because it's cheap and effective. That being said, it is a very rich and thick moisturizer and for some people it actually causes acne. Your mileage may vary. 

The length of time you are looking for results is going to vary based on the results you're looking for. If your skin is simply dehydrated, a moisture routine is going to help you overcome most of that within a week. Acne is going to take a bit longer, especially active sites that need to go through their cycle. And hyperpigmentation can last several months. 

CeraVe is a good place to start, but it's not for everyone. Good luck!

edit: also note that acne looks more red and severe on dry skin because when skin is dry it is more easily agitated which makes acne look worse."

AskReddit,fei1vaf,t3_ep0nuj,1579128455.0,"eesh. People here are far more comfortable expressing their anxiety over the fact that they don't go on dates by making jokes, than they are capable of actually answering the question. 

Uh, I'd say it depends. 

If it's someone you know from work or maybe a classmate or a friend, you may already have some things in common. Don't let the date become a bitch fest about work or school, but maybe talk about how that class you two are in or the company you're working at fits into their goals? When you're done falling, where do you hope to land? Hopes dreams aspirations is what I'd stick with. 

If you're at a different point in your life, perhaps in your late thirties and dating, you're just playing the numbers game and you're legit gonna need to taking active care to avoid burning out. 

In this situation I'd recommend getting straight to some important stuff without being unnecessarily forward. You don't need to ask about having kids, or marriage or anything. FFS it's a first date. 

But statistically, the number 2 thing that couples have in common is political affiliation...and it's only beaten out by sexual orientation. 

So, there's some research out there that it's a winning strategy to dive into the deep difficult topics right off the bat. You're going to get a solid look into who they are AND you're going to see how well they do in substantive conversation. 

How do you feel about guns? How do you feel about religion? How do you feel about abortion? 

It sounds crazy, but it works. If they LOVE guns and you think they represent everything wrong in the world...it's not worth a second date. If they want you to join their cult, but you're an atheist who worships netflix, same thing. If they go to abortion rallies to throw blood on doctors, ya know, get the fuck outta there. 

But if you disagree and have a really great convo about your disagreement, at best you'll realize I can talk this person about hard stuff and it's OK, so maybe a second date. At worst, you got to the heart of the incompatibility and didn't have to suffer a second date, while also not being a complete psycho and greeting them with a ""Bless This Family"" plaque you saw at a flea market. Seriously, talking about kids and marriage on the first day is inappropriate."

SkincareAddiction,fehnvwg,t3_eoxqvr,1579120348.0,"Because people like aestheticians or SCAdians who understand 'skincare and skincare products' don't have all the knowledge and information that a dermatologist has about 'skin' in its full medical, biological context. 

And dermatologists don't really know the first fucking thing about skincare and skincare products. I talked to a dermatologist last year and he said he never recommends anything other than Vanicream, and had never even heard of an oil cleanser. 

You kinda have to synthesize those two fields. And also remember, outside of their specialty, it's almost a sure bet that your doctor is the dumbest person you know. That's the price of being a specialist. Ben Carson is borderline retarded, and simultaneously, the closest thing to a Stephen Hawking of Brain Surgeons. I'm only saying this to make the point that just because someone's a doctor doesn't mean they're objectively correct on all matters.

enrolled in community college, killed it in the honors program taking 20+ unites per quarter while traveling the country doing public speaking in multiple national leadership roles, worked on legislation with Obama's administration, and just did great. Won tons of awards and scholarships, even the biggest scholarship in the world. Was accepted to all the big schools as a transfer, and chose to go to Stanford. 

Incredible misfit with the school, the materialistic philosophy in silicon valley, the entitled kids, the educational philosophy of orthogonal education, etc etc and etc. I was also from NJ, so 3,000 miles from any support network and surrounded by the sycophantic cultists of California networking ecosystem. 

My grades were OK but nothing compared to what I could have achieved with more guidance and more positivity. I wasn't there long enough to land any meaningful internships or establish relationships. To make matters worse, I essentially majored in international climate change policy, economics, and negotiation. Graduated just as Trump is pulling us out of the Paris Climate Accords so my field essentially evaporated. 

I was depressed, moved home, and took some time to figure some shit out. Some time turned into a few years, and I have no fucking clue what to do with myself. Drive Uber and bartend sometimes, occasionally tutor, but I'm a complete loser. 

Now I'm 33 with no prospects and no real job history and a spotty academic record. My job applications all go unanswered, and the job offers I can get immediately make me feel like, ""I went to school for 10 years and achieved all of that...so I could start a career earning $40k doing something I hate?"" Nothing seems to make sense with my life narrative anymore, I can't catch a fucking break, and I'm financially ruined. 

I was on top of the world and I fucked it all up. I know kids who fucked up WAY worse than I did, but they're rich and had networking connections so they just walked into jobs making bank. Feels bad man."
