And your solution to the ship of Theseus paradox is faulty. You claim that, so long as the individual parts of an object exist, that object still exists. But if that were true, the carrot I just ate with dinner still exists, even though it is mashed up into pieces an inside my stomach. But soon, the atoms that made up that carrot will soon be assimilated into my body, and be making up me. So this means that the carrot and me both exist at the same time, somehow sharing the same atoms. By that argument, nothing ever ceases to exist; the dinosaurs still exist because they became oil in our cars, my dead great-grandmother still exist because her brain still exists in a grave somewhere. That's the problem with defining Identity; it's more than just the parts that make something, it's the idea of what it IS."
