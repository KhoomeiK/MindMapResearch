Questioning why as I had no hair the response was: ""Everybody has to do it, so you too. People have been fired over not wearing the hairnet"".  I said I have no issue with a hairnet as ive worked in the foodsector for a long time. Its just ridiculous i have to wear it and the reason why is even more ridiculous. ""I dont think your attitude fits in our company, usually people just do what we tell them to do"". I didnt return after that day.
