I was just using those numbers as an example though to understand what I was getting at.  I mean, Superman literally was able to spin the earth which weighs  5.972 × 10\^24 kg. I am not very good at match but that is a lot of 0's.  Even the difference between the medium and small pizza dough would be magnitudes different than a feather to 25LBS when taking max lift into consideration. It would probably be closer to like differentiating between like two grains of sand or something.

EDIT: Math

Earth weighs  13,170,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 pounds

A Feather weighs 0.002 pounds

A feather is 1/50000 of what my max lift is if my max lift is 100 LBS

25 Pounds is a whole lot less than 1/50000 of 13,170,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

I don't agree that it is the same thing though.

EDIT: Also, in your analogy you are being negative towards black people whereas I never said anything negative about trans.  That would basically mean you think people are racist if they distinguish between white and black people.  I can distinguish between white and black people without being racist."
AskReddit,febvv6q,t1_febsbwy,1578963360.0,"Most fakes are made cheap (hence the price tag) so they do not function better or last longer and most are not completely indistinguishable from the real thing.  You could say the same about a made vagina.  They would last the same (I would assume) but they do not have all the same fuctions and they are not indistinguishable (although just like the example, some likely are pretty damn close)"
AskReddit,febrxov,t1_febe8zf,1578961971.0,"People like knowing things are real. Why do you think designer brands do so well? You can get a fake brand name purse for instance for a few hundred bucks as opposed to $10,000+ for certain brands.  Those brands would not be around still if the majority did not care if things were real or fake."

AskReddit,febr33r,t1_febnl99,1578961742.0,Probably not the best choice of analogy he made I would say but I believe he is using hyperbole here.
AskReddit,febqyf5,t1_febltcz,1578961690.0,"Because biologically they are a man?  Look, I don't consider myself transphobic because I have nothing against trans people.  I think people should be able to be who they choose be and I hope they can find their happiness.  I will call them what they like to be called (him,her,zer, whatever I don't mind) but I do not want to sleep with them because I do not want to sleep with a biological male. 

They have become women and that is fine I am not denying them that but they were not born women and my preference is biological women. There are still many differences between a trans woman and a bio woman.  I have no prejudice, disgust, or hate for trans people.

I do think the devil is in the details though.  If it was a polite declining as opposed to something less polite then I think that argument could definitely be made."
AskReddit,febmsqk,t1_febi4a1,1578960523.0,How about we call it sexual preference because that is what it is.
