SuicideWatch,ffwwks4,t1_ffwwa0g,1580312653.0,I just can't do it anymore
SuicideWatch,ffwvqwu,t1_ffwv1ku,1580312121.0,I have a horse (I'm a girl from germany) but everyone at my stall tells me that I don't deserve my horse because I don't ride him and only walk with him. I can see that they hate me and they talk with my sister about me because I don't speak with anyone and that I should sell my horse because he's too good for me. They all hate me.
SuicideWatch,ffwun2d,t1_ffwsz48,1580311384.0,I have tried to get better since I was 15. I'm 17 now and it has gotten alot worse. My Grades are dropping and all of my beloved animals died. I've lost nearly all of my friends and I'm causing my family too much trouble. I know my problems are not the worse but I can't deal with it anymore.
offmychest,fe8fa3i,t3_enrwa2,1578925556.0,Yeah all the time
