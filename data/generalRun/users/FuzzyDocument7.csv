My Mum who didn’t care about seeing me get married was all of a sudden my BFF . My second child I could not wait to find out which sex and was too excited so I told my Mum I was having a girl well, she blurted it to my brothers partner but would not let me tell my Dad cause “ he’s so old fashioned he doesn’t want to know yet” bull crap Mum. You have your Mum on low contact that’s great don’t let her make anything about her cause it isn’t. In regards to Grandma I’m so sorry if you cannot tell her!"
