Job interviews, cooperating with coworkers and management, college classes, relationships. I was very shy and kept to myself when I was young, although high school hijinks helped a lot. Found my voice and was able to figure out who were my friends and who were just acquaintances. 

If you don't interact with people you learn nothing about behavior. Reading body language is an essential skill if you want to figure out who's lying, or potentially violent, or just plain crazy. Remember that old saying: Actions speak louder than words. Reading your phone and surfing the interwebs are all just words."
