detrans,ffg76lk,t3_et16ss,1579899925.0,"The sense of clarity is almost certainly psychological and not related to T. Probably because you made a decision and don't have to keep thinking about whether you should detransition or not.

I think you being unstable at the time is just par for the course. Most people transition because something isn't going right. I hope things are better for you now. I'm still debating detransition.  There's been both upsides and downsides so it's a tough sell to go through the upheaval of transitioning again."

A more extreme option is something like MDMA therapy, but results may vary. Other than that I've not really seen much credible advice on how to actually better love oneself. Seems to be a mix of genetics, parental care, and place in society.

Maybe consider electrolyte tablets. I know runners and other distance sports athletes will use electrolyte tablets since they're sweating out so much water and using large stores of energy for endurance.

Try something like Nuun. I think you can find those in grocery stores. Otherwise look for a running store or other athletic store. These thg tablets are generally low to no calorie, but if you're being super duper strict about fasting, check if it has sugar.

Let's be honest. Thinner women are more prized in society. It's like duh. Of course women will choose dieting in order to gain that. It's natural for people to crave acceptance and to be desired.

getdisciplined,fcozdv1,t1_fcop86f,1577845824.0,"Sorry you feel that way. I struggle with feeling like a ""waste of space"" too sometimes. It's important to remember that most people aren't being this uber productive machine churning out publicly visible accomplishments day in and day out. Hell most people recognized as being accomplished in any given thing professionally don't get there until like their 40s or 50s and that's just in their one small domain.

The fact you did 30 minutes of meditation today is a big win. Over 99% of people won't even try 1 minute of meditation. And meditation is one of those habits known to have significant longterm and shortterm benefits.

I think it goes back to having the goals more realistic. ""Moving mountains"" is unrealistic as I'm sure you know. Picture anyone you feel kindly towards. Do you criticize them for not being a major success?

Think of one thing you would like to do in the next 3-6 months. Hell maybe even 1 month. Because having immediate evidence of results in the beginning is important to kickstart the ongoing motivation. What is the one thing you could do a few times every week to get there?

One tip is to set the goal to be what seems laughably easy at first. Most of the time just getting started is the hardest part, not actually doing the thing. One of my favorite pieces of advice I've heard for new gym goers was to just go to the gym in their workout clothes, sit on a bench, and leave without exercising. That was the entire goal for like the first 2 weeks. Because most people think exercising will be really challenging (or any new habit), but really they just get stuck getting over the initial hurdle of starting. The idea with this advice was that once a person gets to the gym, they can choose to just sit for a second and leave and at the very least they're building the habit of making the gym a destination. But even better once they're there often people may just decide they'll go and try one machine or a little walk. So see if you can make it your goal to just get to the starting point of whatever you'd like to try without putting on the added burden of requiring yourself to go through a lengthy time commitment.

I used this to restart a meditation habit for awhile by setting what felt like a ridiculously easy goal. Meditate for 5 minutes 3x/week. I figured I sit around a lot more than just 5 min per day so I know I can at the very least do 5 minutes. And once I hit that easy 5 min I can finish or I can keep going but only if I feel like it. And often once I started, once I hit 5 minutes I was like, ok let's just add on another 5-10 minutes and so on."
getdisciplined,fco22cw,t3_ei79rj,1577822651.0,Challenge: just pick ANY goal that's springs to mind. What's something you can do in the next 2 minutes to say you made some iota of progress?
getdisciplined,fcnzxpk,t3_ei79rj,1577821592.0,"Exactly what the other person said. Nobody is successful at changing multiple major things all at once. Big change comes from very very small things done consistently. For me it started from wanting to look better and be healthier so I started walking a couple blocks. And then next week a couple more blocks. Next week maybe 30 seconds of ""running"" aka fast shuffling. Anyways after like a year or two I'm doing 5k and 10k races and later half marathons. Very slowly, but good damn it I did them and it felt fantastic. I tracked my miles and times and speed and it was nice to always see something I could improve on. Either time spent moving, speed, distance, weight, whatever. And it's not like I ever told myself I'd be a record winning runner or have a model body, but I knew if I did even a little bit a few times a week I would see progress. You almost can't avoid improving if you consistently do any new skill. Beginner gains are awesome in that way.

Anyways, just pick ONE goal you want to tackle. And in that one goal make it something realistically achievable. I never would've gotten into running if my first goal was to run a marathon. For example the realistic goal at first was I just wanted to be able to eventually run a whole mile without stopping or walking. So in the first days/weeks it was ok let's walk up and down my street twice and that's it and eventually it built from there.

One more thing is the biggest things that changed my life for the better was joining clubs/community orgs. I started trying running clubs because I knew running with others would motivate me to run faster/longer. And trust me I'm super introverted and nervous most the time, but when you're running with a group I could focus on the task more than my social anxiety bs. Plus there was always food and beer afterwards which I found intrinsically motivating as a lonely introvert kid. Running gave that common purpose to the group so it was easy to strike up a conversation with anyone about something related to running or fitness or related topics.

Then I got super into roller derby on the advice of a coworker and that was another place I found a community of people who were all trying to learn this new skill and many of us in similar stage of life.

I still have a natural tendency towards introversion, but buddy even though it doesn't feel like it, being around a community is what makes life worth living. Especially if there's a strong mission behind it aligned with your goals. Maybe a volunteer gig of some sort.

Hope you find something that keeps you engaged with some skill and with the people around you. You don't have to be an extrovert by any means, but we all need others."

ukulele,fcbogq0,t3_eh07mv,1577589205.0,"Is it worth playing?

Yes for the simple answer.

Nuanced answer: why do you want to play it? Are you interested enough in playing baritone to justify spending the money?

The main difference with baritone is it doesn't use reentrant tuning like the other, smaller ukuleles. The strings ascend from low to high instead of high-low-medium-highest like you're used to on a tenor. You can still play the same chord shapes you use on tenor on a baritone, but the chord voicings might not sound as good so you may need to learn some new chord shapes. Other than that it's just memorizing the new locations of notes and chords. You can do it. It's only a matter of practice and time.

An upside to learning bari uke is it's an easy transition to guitar if you'd ever like to play around with that. I came from guitar to bari uke and it was a relatively painless switch.

As far as brands, I'm not a gear head. Probably any of the popular brands people always mention will be good. Like Kala. Ultimately it'll be whatever ukulele you like playing the most. The first, cheap uke I got wasn't what I'd call a ""good"" ukulele. It was cheaply made. But I loved how much projection it had, how dark it sounded, and that I could throw it all over the place without caring much since it was relatively inexpensive."
