Veterans,ffclmtj,t3_eswe88,1579802077.0,Its AMAZING how the don't have a call back system for the wait times. I tend to think its just some lazy assed worker (sista gurl) that lets that shit hold for that long. I called one and the bitch just gave me a number to another Voc Rehab that gave me the number right back to the origjnal. It can't be that fuckin busy down there to where they cant give you a response. Apologize for the rant just hate seeing vets not getting services they need.

Veterans,ff8hkto,t3_erzn3a,1579678822.0,Another question: I wonder what the statistic is for the number of vets that have been prevented from committing suicide by using the VA suicide prevention hotline. Just asking.
Veterans,ff8hdye,t3_erzn3a,1579678577.0,"I also lost two friends to suicide (only one was a vet and was already out 15+ years) which deeply affected me. I do think the DoD projected this outcome with the suicide rates we see now in society as vets are conditioned,not trained to navigate through to the other side of life where that conditioning starts to wear off. I say this due to my own experience with the so called ""self-medicating"" coping mechanism ( mainly alchohol,now sober though and weed,nothing more) that I think alot of us vets choose over the VA's bullshit. I do think the system thats set to deal with this, for lack of another term, ""phenomena"" is and was designed to ""appear"" to the general public as the DoDs effort to provide the vet with the appropriate care. I do think and have met with healthcare workers for the VA that are some genuinely great people, they just work for a intentionally broken system that is designed to fail the veteran."
