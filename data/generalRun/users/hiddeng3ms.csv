college,ffh92i7,t3_etkb7x,1579926634.0,"Scrolled down to read that you've tried joining clubs and other kinds of activities (to which I highly recommend you still do), but you don't put yourself out there. Going to these social events is the easy part, the hard part comes in when you talk to people. Most people won't go out of their way to talk to you, you have to go up and talk to them. Sure, some times things will get awkward and you won;t mesh well with others, it just happens sometimes. Don't get discouraged when this happens. Just keep going to different club meetings and campus events and try to see if you can strike up a conversation with someone. Best of luck to you!"
college,ffh8oov,t3_etfpv7,1579926301.0,"I never thought that your GPA could just be a flat 0? Holy shit, what in the world did you do your entire first semester? I'm honestly impressed that, one, a GPA like that is even possible, and two, your university didn't immediately kick you out and refused to let you back in at all.

The first couple semesters of college are crucial to establish a high GPA in order to have a little bit of cushion if you tank in a harder class later on. It's super easy for your GPA to go down and stay down, and extremely difficult if you want to get it back up in good standing. Even if you aced all your classes this semester, 100% across the board, it still might not be enough to pull up your GPA where you need it to be. Not to be a downer, only thinking realistically here.

Still, best of luck to you if you're serious about your goal. Props to you for wanting to turn your life around. All the same, if you still find yourself struggling, for the sake of your students loans and what sliver of academic standing you have left, leave. No sense in spending thousands of dollars and risking you not being able to let back into any university at all in case you want to go back."
AskReddit,ff2h09x,t3_er2z87,1579505749.0,"Not a train driver, but once took a train out in Colorado where the folks by the river would moon the train as we went by. Bunch of drunk tourists usually, the train would whistle and the passengers would whistle too. All in good fun, certainly gave all of us on board a good laugh."
college,ff2gkk4,t1_ff2f3tn,1579505219.0,"Trust me, things will get better if things are rough for you right now. Stay hopeful, my dude. Keep working hard but don’t forget to take time for yourself. You got this!"
college,ff2clpg,t3_er4idd,1579500789.0,"It just kind of... happens? There's really no concrete way to go about relationships in college. I met my partner at a video game tournament hosted by the campus' robotics team. You meet people in the weirdest places under the strangest circumstances. Some people will be down to date, other's won't. It's just a fact you have to accept if you want to go for a relationship in college. More people are looking for hookups or quick flings, or they're focusing on themselves and may just not want to date right now. All are perfectly normal and fine.

But don't beat yourself up man. Just pick up the pieces and try again when you feel up for it."
college,ff2bwj0,t3_er7190,1579500082.0,"Switch out to a different professor if you can. If not, then it's not worth the risk of your GPA tanking. Sounds like you're reluctant to take a non-required class with a sour professor. I'd say it's worth the headache. You can use that extra slot to take a class that will help out in your major or and extracurricular if you please. But don't force yourself to take a class that you don't need, in a subject that you're not good at, with an apparently bad professor simply because someone recommended it to you. Advisors are not always right."
college,ff2bk52,t3_er52nj,1579499736.0,"I'm looking through the comments and I see that it's only your second semester starting back. My first couple semesters of college were literal hell, I had a crazy, aggressive roommate, lived in a loud ""party"" building, had no friends, severe anxiety and depression, the works. All I focused on was my schoolwork and it wasn't fun at all, I dreaded finding my major and taking progressively hard classes.

Now I'm graduating soon, I have an amazing group of friends that I love and cherish and made great connections with my department. It took a while, but I'm so happy that things turned out the way they did. It just takes some time and patience for things to kick in. Another thing is, if you want to socialize, that doesn't come to you. You have to go out and try new things to meet new people. You have to go to clubs, social events, and even parties if that's your cup of tea. You'll learn the work-social life balance gradually, it doesn't just come naturally. 

Chin up, things aren't all bad. You just need to be patient and give it time. No one has it all figured out. If you're still antsy, take initiative and find those friends, seek out those internships and put your foot forward in your department to make connections. Future you will thank past you."
weeabootales,fef2b5z,t3_ema56j,1579046504.0,"One that I was kind of expecting to be on this list is a ""Chinaboo."" Basically, the same criteria for weeaboos and koreaboos with the same level of obsession and defenses but with China. I know a person who is like this; fetishizes and exclusively fawns over ethnically-Chinese people, their food and culture, and even is an apologist for China's suppressive communist regime... it's almost bonkers."
AmItheAsshole,fdhsr6f,t3_el57pr,1578429470.0,"As someone who was fed warped perspectives from both of my parents when they divorced for years and years, it takes a long time for someone who has been hearing one side to start to believe another. Counseling will help speed up the process, but sitting her down and talking things out WITHOUT your fiancé present may help out things a lot. Your daughter is going to still have some resentments since she spent so much time with her mother and probably got an earful about you. Just talk with her, consider counseling, and give her time."

Lord Huron is much bigger than just their music, their YouTube channel and past campaigns promoting their albums all tie in to the lore of their albums. 

Here, try calling this number (hoping it still works). Maybe this might give you some insight.
