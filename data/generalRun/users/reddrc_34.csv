The kind of dieting that is for bettering your physical health sounds good, but I think what body positive people might be more concerned about is along the lines of trend diets. Those happen to be more cosmetic and not like what I think you’re trying to achieve with your own personal health goals.

Obesity is a problem in many countries, but from what I know about it, the concept of body positivity is loving yourself even if you aren’t like a size 0-2, because so many people are not but they are still healthy and conscious of their diets. Being skinny does not equate to being healthy either, people have all different types of metabolisms and builds, too. Maybe parts of body positively come off as though they want to accept unhealthy standards, but personally I think that majority of it is just recognizing that not all people fit the idealized build, and those bodies should all be validated and cared about regardless of size."
AskReddit,ffe3zqj,t1_ffe3d8i,1579836100.0,"Part of it is just trying to show that most body standards are unrealistic. There’s so many sizes (M-XXXL and beyond) that wouldn’t be idealized or seen on a runway. Also, diets can be extremely detrimental to your digestive health if you cut out major food groups or necessary parts of meals because you want to look better. Then, you might end up being less healthy and less happy with yourself.

May I ask why you don’t like fat acceptance?"
