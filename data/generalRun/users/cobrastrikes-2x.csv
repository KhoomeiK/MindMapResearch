aww,fgsb1q4,t1_fgsafaf,1581079050.0,"That’s pretty cool. Generally though, most of the ones we saw were trained with Czechoslovakian commands. They used foreign languages a lot so nobody would try and tell your dog to do something you didn’t want them to do.

Edit: While they do bark quite a bit from anxiety, the one we had at home who wasn’t a police dog loved to bark all the time especially when you played with him. If he doesn’t respect me, I’ll be sad because I helped raise Cobra from a puppy."
aww,fgs9z00,t1_fgs2pmf,1581077984.0,"My dad trained with a couple of those like a decade ago. We used to go back to the trainer once a year to compete in “The dog oympics” where all of the police dogs she’d trained that are still in active duty would compete in fun sports like wall traversing that was a high wall about as tall as that dog reached running up that tree. Kody’s pretty old and he’s not as fierce a K-9 unit anymore, but he’s still good, retired boy. His bark has gotten pretty high pitched in his old age as well, I always chuckle when I hear it.

Edit: My dads was a Belgian Malinois in case that’s actually some variation from what we’re seeing. 

Also words for grammar and replacing y’all with tall."

MortalKombat,fgop4lv,t1_fgmwrny,1580979606.0,"Folks just don’t know how to have a conversation anymore. If you don’t like that I believe his MKX iteration was baller, tell me why it wasn’t or explain what about it irks you, right? Why fuck with my karma just because you don’t agree with me?"
MortalKombat,fgop048,t1_fgol8bh,1580979424.0,I find myself listening to a lot of the old OSTs in the background at work these days. They’re just... good.
SandersForPresident,fgno74u,t1_fgnjdm4,1580949193.0,"In just a moment, I’m going to ask your mother to make a contribution to my assblasting campaign.  I’m not going around to the rich, wealthy mothers of this city, I’m coming to your mother and all the other middle class mothers for legitimate contributions."
MortalKombat,fgnbyai,t3_ezc8fh,1580941650.0,I loved his MKX appearance and I think jacked dudes are cool. This is the best of both worlds.
MortalKombat,fglheei,t1_fglh8w9,1580897865.0,"Absolutely that can be done. I think some of the talent they can pull in nowadays would love to take a crack at the MK mythos. I for one would love to see how the timeline will play out. Most characters are sure to come back, but how will they align themselves now? How active will Liu Kang be now that he’s the sole Elder God keeping the realms in check? Will he even know about the one being and the danger that it poses to those unaware of it?"
medievil,fgldrej,t3_eywpcq,1580892536.0,"It looks really good, but it makes me laugh because I know he runs more clumsily than that."
MortalKombat,fgk9p4a,t1_fgiv226,1580860541.0,Same.
MortalKombat,fgk988i,t1_fgjadtk,1580860240.0,"The beautiful part is that pretty much the entire series are the notes! I’m gonna drop my bois off right about where the deception campaign kicks off. Every major event in the timeline will play out exactly as it had in the beginning with my two players as the only variable. So we may get to Shao Kahn at the top of the pyramids or we could potentially end up rebooting later or earlier than that. The objective is for my players to at some point transcend Kronika’s influence on history, while also conflicting with major historical events or maneuvering around them. Like if they kill or deter Reptile from entering the dragon egg chamber, Onaga’s resurrection may not come to pass or it may simply occur later. That one I’d leave up to the dice roll because there were a few possibilities.

Edit: I’m also planning to pick up a pathfinder characters and monsters codex and I’ll assign the most fitting stats to specific mk character albeit most likely with a few tweaks. I may post about that when it happens, so if you ask then, I’ll gladly show my hand."
MortalKombat,fgk8nwy,t1_fgir5yg,1580859877.0,"Not as lucky as I’d like to be. I wanted to at least catch up to the steel ball run, but only France and Japan have those as of now I think."
MortalKombat,fginswv,t1_fging57,1580826755.0,Thanks. Best thing heroforge ever did was add custom posing.
MortalKombat,fginrx5,t1_fginoa3,1580826735.0,"Lots of those getting around lately, right?"
MortalKombat,fgiju6w,t1_fgiisbt,1580823752.0,"There a couple places you can put your own minies together, but I usually use heroforge because that site lets bank a bunch saved templates. I have like 300 I haven’t printed and like 80% of those will probably never see the light of day."

Edited for missing words."
MortalKombat,fgejm68,t3_exva8l,1580701083.0,I would have liked to hear even an offhanded explanation as to why either Reptile and Ermac weren't present at all during the story. Like even some thing as simple as Kotal's going to handle some Tarkatans personally because his personal vanguard are busy handling this specific investigation or putting the reigns on that Edenian uprising.
AskReddit,fg9f1go,t3_exagml,1580637959.0,I wish I'd had any measure of self-awareness. I saw how my brother behaved and knew how much I hated that. I saw how my mother behaved and knew how much I hated that. Then I'd go to school and become a combination of all those things I hated about my family instead of rising above and showing some iota of principle.

MortalKombat,fg7tlfg,t3_ex770w,1580601140.0,Reptile coming back with that Scary Monsters stand for DLC. What do you think Scorpion's stand is? I know Sub-zero's got Horus.
MortalKombat,fg7f4gj,t1_fg6okxa,1580590982.0,"HA, if I was Galactus, would I be a reddit user? Let me rephrase that, if I was Galactus, would I be subscribed to r/MortalKombat?"
MortalKombat,fg5nw6l,t3_ewjmdq,1580532804.0,I really like the darker tone of scales as opposed to the primary color of his garb. I would totally accept this a Reptile skin.
MortalKombat,fg5np98,t1_fg5ecsi,1580532635.0,"I love it for its absurdity. The 3D era was my first reintroduction since I played trilogy in my single digit years, so when I got back into it in my mid-teens, I thought that was kind of awesome. Nowadays, his DA skin is probably my third favorite costume right behind his Shaolin Monks and MKX appearances."

MortalKombat,fg4hsa3,t3_ewtqym,1580503537.0,"I guess what you could do is tear the socks apart into little bits and add them to some kind of food right? IF we are holding him to that gamble, then I suppose making it easier for him wouldn’t be too bad. I would probably pick them apart to the point they’re almost completely broken down to dust and then just put them in brownies or something super overpowering."

MortalKombat,ffsazuw,t1_ffqdzue,1580177434.0,"I would have loved a scene of him turning her down realizing that there’s no consistent timeline. He might get his family back for now, but when she revamps the timeline, he’s likely to be every bit as fucked and lonely as he was before. Next time he might not have the friendship he has in Kotal."

MortalKombat,fflx4wc,t1_ffjmcbq,1580045244.0,His story’s a pretty good revenge western. Typical deal with the devil but the story feels very cathartic.
MortalKombat,ffh7bwj,t1_ffh45u1,1579925149.0,"I find it odd, that so many people in this sub relate correlation and causation so frequently and without any say from devs like ""Hey if you see a konsumable from any fighter, don't expect a DLC for them in the future."" The honest truth of it all is that it comes down to what the devs want to do and what WB thinks will make the most money from those options. I honestly think think that a lot of the guests got in not at WB's behest, but because Netherrealm wanted to do them and WB sees a move like that as a smart business opportunity."
AskReddit,ffgwjz3,t1_fffwb79,1579916880.0,I would sing quietly to myself in school between classes. One girl in particular would compliment my singing when she heard. I've since never forgotten. I wish I could remember her name so I could reach her on social media and say hi.

PublicFreakout,ffal5np,t3_esd5wh,1579738497.0,"I wish big time disputes and disagreements could be solved with a simple one on one kickboxing match sometimes. Like if you want that border so bad, train up and your guy will meet our guy for a few rounds in the ring, but when it’s over, winner gets final decision and everyone has to respect the outcome. Also, a paper view event that decides massive geopolitical disputes would bring in TONS of cash for media providers."
AskReddit,ffa7uuc,t3_esc8vq,1579729584.0,"I’d show him all of my cool memorabilia, all the game consoles I buy myself, and tell him what work actually interests me now and explain exactly why some of my previous interests didn’t work out.

My grandpa used to have a bad temper problem and even hit his kids at times, but he couldn't stomach what BIL was doing and just let loose on the guy and yelled at his wife like a mad man for not saying anything.
