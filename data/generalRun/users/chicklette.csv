Would it be possible to give more information about this event?   Are we expected to bring crafts with us? Is someone going to lead us in a craft? Is this going to be more like a stitch-n-bitch? Or is this more of a meet and greet where we will all just be getting to know each other? 

Thanks!"

I'm not a veg, but was married to one and have had several family members who are. When hosting for vegetarians, I often made things that were ""mainstream"" but skipped the meat: veggie lasagna, cheese enchiladas, eggplant parmesan, etc. 

Imo, the worst thing is being fed meat substitutes w/o being told beforehand. I am sensitive to soy, so being fed faux meat would really mess me up.

It's awesome for stocks, and last night I made a white bean and chard soup in under an hour using dried beans (cheaper, healthier). 

Its amazing for shredded chicken or beef, and short ribs come out fantastic.

Doing hard boiled eggs in there is awesome. You can do a whole dozen, they cook perfectly, and they practically eject themselves from the shells.
