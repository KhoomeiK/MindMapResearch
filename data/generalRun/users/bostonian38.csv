Big money in politics, corporate lobbying, and billionaires rigging the laws are going to make sure that we can never get what we want.

What we need is a movement to put pressure on the system and force real change. Bernie has that movement, and knows exactly how to utilize it to do so. His campaign is the one chance at opening the future up for what ordinary people support.

That’s a pretty apt overview of how I see it, without even getting into the policies of universal healthcare, a living wage, free public college, etc."
