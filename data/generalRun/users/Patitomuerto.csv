fnki,ffisl4p,t3_etulkb,1579981665.0,Bumblbee killing off those who even hint at having another gay ship on the show
RWBY,ffio8to,t1_ffinzue,1579978622.0,"I mean, I get Qrow being pissed at Ironwood and deciding to place the blame on him, but it was just a weird thing for Clover to say"
RWBY,ffinlgu,t1_ffinfn8,1579978182.0,"okay, that makes some sense. When I first heard it, it almost sounded like he was saying that they were going to blame everything on RWBYJNRQ?"
RWBY,ffin33a,t3_etsqfi,1579977828.0,I'm confused by the whole 'Someone had to take the fall' line. What exactly is that supposed to mean?
RWBY,ffilnjt,t1_ffih3pb,1579976840.0,"Right? I was just waiting for her to poof and leave like, a fire Blake behind. That would've been great"
RWBY,ffilj35,t1_ffihgj6,1579976753.0,I feel like it was supposed to be the wiggle of his thumb as he sorta shook it for fun that was supposed to be barf inducing.
RWBY,ffile3t,t1_ffiirym,1579976657.0,Captain Tyrian steering the ship to madnessville
RWBY,ffila5j,t1_ffihceh,1579976581.0,"Blake did not get her aura broken. The hit on the wall was hard, but it didn't do the little poofy sparkles that happen when an aura actually breaks....this season. Yes, in seasons past just a flash like that meant a broken aura, but this season they added the sparkles"
RWBY,ffikexl,t1_ffiibxe,1579975985.0,"I seriously don't get why Clover was so dumb and happy to throw away the lives of the others just to follow his orders. Or why people think that Qrow is the one who made the bad decision...yes, it was a bad decision, but the options were be arrested, watch the fight which I'll bet Clover wouldn't win, and then get slaughtered along with Robyn by the serial killer it took three people to take down"
RWBY,ffik8k8,t1_ffihw99,1579975862.0,"I'd love if Cinder killed her, and she's put into the transfer machine to be brought back as the maiden"
RWBY,ffik3sv,t1_ffiivbm,1579975769.0,"Thats what I don't get, the enemies aren't at the gate, they're inside. Even if Ironwood had gotten the people in prison, Cinder was literally led right to the maiden and without the maiden, there is no plan. If they didn't have Cinder and Neo on the inside maybe I could see abandoning Mantle as a proper plan, but with those two already in Atlas it makes no sense"
RWBY,ffieihk,t3_etsqfi,1579971957.0,"Was anybody else pissed when Clover just peaced out of the transport the second shit went bad? Seriously, just leave the three others to die in the wreck you lucky bastard."
pokemon,ffbd7kf,t3_esp59u,1579760398.0,"She doesn't use reddit, so she gave me permission to post it"
RWBY,ff588kg,t1_ff4fdgy,1579583134.0,"Right? I'll bet several times he's had people straight up give up on life just finding out about Salems backstory. Hell, Raven did it."
RWBY,ff3wkjq,t3_eratks,1579550417.0,I feel like the big difference people aren't seeing between RWBY and Ozpin is that Ozpin was never going to tell the truth. RWBY is once they're sure they can trust people.
RWBY,feudhor,t1_fetzd1u,1579385528.0,Good point
RWBY,fetxvko,t1_fetimn7,1579381124.0,"Unlikely that it was Oscar fighting the guards cause until the meeting in the room Ironwood hadn't decided to go all martial law on everybody. So that fight had to take place before jnr got there, which was perfectly timed with Ironwoods freak out"
aww,feizvkm,t1_fehl4tb,1579151989.0,A guy in my city caught it a few years ago cause he accidently ran over a rabbit who had it with his mower and got sprayed by its blood
RWBY,fe2zvab,t1_fe13lwl,1578844604.0,Frustrating
RWBY,fe02ca6,t1_fdyhovp,1578801324.0,Thats what I was wondering. Since apparently just touching something with his rings lets him control it. Interesting if the fight has to keep Watts at a distance
RWBY,fe0274b,t1_fdz2cqy,1578801225.0,I'd kill to see that fight
RWBY,fe01mu0,t1_fdyyzwf,1578800834.0,"I love that detail of Elm's gun, and that even rooted to the ground it rocked her back pretty hard."
RWBY,fe01hxu,t1_fdz53lt,1578800746.0,It seems likely the bag will be important since they showed it being thrown
RWBY,fe015mh,t1_fdzd7lw,1578800526.0,I almost yeeted my computer when the screen cut out. Argh! Just give me an awesome fight scene damnit!
RWBY,fe013fg,t1_fdz9ijp,1578800491.0,"Thats only if she dies by the stretch armstrong grimm arm that Cinder has, any other death and its up in the air. I could see Winter being trained and motivated enough to force Cinder from her mind to make sure it doesn't go naturally to Cinder."
AskReddit,fdlqdjw,t3_elssvy,1578529994.0,"That my dad wrote the song Piano Man. He was a keyboardist, and I'd often listen to him practice and he would play Piano Man to me and it just made since, he was a man, and he played piano, therefore he was the piano man."
AskReddit,fdg6ahg,t3_el2az5,1578381747.0,Leslie Knope. Not a bad choice actually
dogs,fd3yw20,t3_ejyj5g,1578162872.0,"awww, what an adorable little sausage. Tell her congrats on the weight loss!"
pokemon,fd3x5zm,t1_fd2vzv3,1578162375.0,"Yeah, Xerneas all the way for me"
dogs,fd3uoce,t1_fd3t9so,1578161756.0,"Lawls, no worries, I was going to joke that she's a potato and sweet, therefore a sweet potato, but I'm not always so quick on the uptake."
dogs,fd3px6s,t1_fd3pdvi,1578160643.0,"Yeah, I know. But I originally wasn't thinking of potato's at all when I named her, but my roommate immediately started calling her sweet potato, so yeah."
MLPdrawingschool,fd3p7dd,t3_ejz57j,1578160514.0,I would actually go more extreme with the shadows. More contrast would make the picture look more dynamic
dogs,fd3ly7l,t3_ejxgxj,1578159610.0,"If you have the resources, some people make a sandpit for their dog to dig in and teach them to only dig in there"
FurryArtSchool,fbtcxx9,t3_eeavhy,1577074837.0,"I love the texture. Really does give the feeling of actual fur.   
 
If I were to fix anything, it would be the eye. It feels a little too close to the nose"
