drugmemes,ffxaovm,t3_evjh5j,1580321265.0,"One time I invited a guy to a party hosted by the honors pre-med fraternity. I didn’t know him that well, but he was on the PA (physicians assistant) track so I thought “why not, the more company the better”. BIG MISTAKE. 

After about 30min a few drinks in (more than a few for him) he comes up to me and tells me to come upstairs with him. I of course rejected. HOWEVER, he then says very loudly “there’s always a coke room upstairs at parties”. He wouldn’t stop bothering me to go look with him. 

After managing to lose him in the crowd, people come up to me and tell me he is looking for me. I managed to avoid him for awhile but then he finds me with this girl he just met. We’re all talking and he says “yeah she sells me acid”. He’s very drunk at this point, but it really pissed me off and I said something slightly threatening. 

All the leaders of the society noticed his behavior and to this day will not admit that I invited him to the party. I don’t know why this guy thought there would be a coke room upstairs in the Pre-Med honors society party... 

Don’t get me wrong, coke is fun. Just not appropriate at this occasion, nor did I want to do any then."
