funny,ffyofv9,t3_evx7wm,1580351268.0,"No joke here, just a cooking suggestion: oil the meat, not the pan. This prevents Spatter City. Put the steak and oil (or melted clarified butter) in a bowl or something and season/coat/flip and dip-n-dive around to coat. Heat up your pan to high heat. Lay your piece of animal on there and sear on both sides, turning once after first side is sealed dark and goldy and use the push test to determine if it’s cooked to desired thoroughness and if it’s under, just put under grill or in oven. No more Spatter City and no more flip flopping. Your pan will have a nice crust on it and yeah use a better pan, but chuck some diced onions or whatever in there and some garlic and then de-glaze with some white wine or whatever and reduce that down and then add a bit of cream and reduce again and then finish with a dollop of butter and season and boom. Mushrooms in there, green peppercorns or whatever and you got yourself a pretty bomb-ass plate, few potatoes and some greens or whatever and yeah it’s almost gravy, but better."

woooosh,ffoh4ez,t1_ffc7kjt,1580077594.0,"Nah, Catholics are more Mary-on than Christ-ion. All the praise to Mary? Keeping Christ on the cross, when He is risen? The delight in fancy robes and storing up riches on earth-in the form
of the largest real estate holdings on earth as well as mega wealth and treasure- rather than storing up riches in heaven and not having the showy-ness of the earthly possessions; these are a few examples of why I don’t consider Catholics to be of Christ, they’re more of Mary and the world and of recognition on earth, rather than in heaven. When the scriptures tell of gnashing of teeth and the declarations of ‘we cast out demons in your name’ I reckon a lot of those jokers will be Catholics and jehovahs witnesses etc and the Lord will say, ‘I worked THROUGH you, but I don’t know you’...this is all pretty heavy and preachy, but bottom line, Catholics are Catholics, not Christians, whether baptist or Presbyterian, they’re Christian, but Catholics are Catholics and I don’t reckon Catholics in general will be going to heaven, but, you know, I shouldn’t judge, I’m not judging, just my opinion, maybe some Catholics will go to heaven, but most will be all gnashy of teethy and raging at the rapture, coz they put they faith in man and the world instead of the tri-unity of Jesus, the Father and Holy Spirit, the triumvirate that sits in the highest, who can be reached through Jesus, everyone’s personal saviour. We don’t need to wear fancy robes and go to an ornate church to be one with God, only  Jesus in our hearts. You don’t hear that shit in a Catholic Church. Just sayin...you may as well consider Catholics to be Buddhist as much as Christian, coz they ain’t neither gowl dangit"

If you’re so close to the fires, you wouldn’t have an anomaly like this in your vicinity.

The smoke travelling a huge distance will have a different effect to those comparatively nearby, this ain’t no science speak, just feet on the ground observations, oh and yeah before we had that in Auck, people in the South Is saw the smoke before us, I don’t know how that works, except maybe the Sth Is is closer to Oz than the Nth Is coz Oz is more to the side than above us on the planet. I dunno, not to be rude and hey we feel stink your place is so hot right now, but this pic could very well be the haze from the fires, I’d say it is, it’s a bummer, but yeah being further away than you are from it all, there is a different effect for sure.
