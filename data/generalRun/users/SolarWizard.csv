My parents didn't even tske good care of us. I have never had a proper conversatiom with either and my mum lived her failed dreams through me by getting me into activities like dancing and violin that she had always wanted to do, but she wouldnt let me do what I wanted to do - guitar aand martial arts.
They arent even religious but I think having so many kids was a form of self sabotage for mum. She wanted to learn things and travel the world, but ""oh woops I can't do anything because I have the kids to look after"""

PersonalFinanceNZ,ffv1cn7,t1_ffusyog,1580253427.0,"I think the issue is that at my practice the hours are weird. It works out at 6-7 hours per day when lunch etc is taken into account. I was also misleading above because I actually only do 4 days per week for the 150k salary so that probably accounts for the difference. However I also get payed for 7 hours of paperwork per week so that is essentially an extra day of pay so kinda counts as 5 days per week which equals around 35 hours in total. Certainly not as much as I would have expected going into this but it is pretty comfortable. I also provably actually do 3 hours of paperwork a week so I get 4 hours free depending. 
I feel I need to do some more research still but when I talked to my collegues in the region previously they were on slightly less per hour and also did not get payed for extra paperwork hours at all, so I feel that is a huge perk for me."

As for free counselling, Vibe is probably your next best bet. They have excellent services but it depends on your age. Vic uni dose cheap counselling.

It really sucks when all of my patients (who are usually older) think I am wealthy and will complain loudly about any extra costs (eg $80 for a minor surgery, most of which is materials costs) and will often refuse to pay so I end up comping them. Then they go home to their house, new car and boat while I'm still renting, paying off my loan, paying 5k in registration and insurance per year, own a cheap second hand car and will take years more to buy a house. I think TV and movies skew perceptions because American specialists can earn lots of money. We also suffer from the same issues of stagnant wages over the last 50 years as everyone else.

The practice gets a certain amount of money per year from the government per enrolled patient (it varies by demographic but IIRC is around $100 per patient). When a patient visits they also pay around $40 for their appointment but under 14s are free. It is the sum of these two payments where we get our money from. I don't have to deal with money, insurance or any complex billing at all. My days are spent seeing patients, following up on test results and also the odd referral to a specialist. I also get payed for 7 hours of paperwork per week and probably do around 3-4 broken down into small chunks between patients or a bit here and there at lunch or at the end of the day.

Edit: We only see 20-25 patients per day . 15 minute appointments with a 15 minute free slot every hour. Salary starts at 150k per year for a 4 day week. 4 weeks payed vacation per year. Student loans are usually 80k max for the full 6 years of training and everyone uses a government loan for these as they are interest-free unless you move overseas."
