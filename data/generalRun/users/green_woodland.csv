melbourne,fevun4l,t1_fevtolm,1579401726.0,ps. Sorry that reply was sort of rude. Thank u
melbourne,fevu4tj,t1_fevpe5x,1579401533.0,Thank you! I know it’s not too hard to understand but I’ve only recently gotten my license and I just wanted to make sure I understood correctly
melbourne,fevtuj9,t1_fevqhzd,1579401424.0,Thank you!! This explains it well
melbourne,fevtolm,t1_fevq4jg,1579401361.0,"I mean I mentioned after that I knew this website existed but it doesn’t answer my specific question and hence wasn’t what I was trying to find out, no need 2 be patronising my dude 

Thank you though for clarifying"
melbourne,fevo9sw,t1_fevnywg,1579399654.0,"It’s honestly so incredibly vague :( or maybe I’m just dumb. I believe there’s a website where you can put in your license number and see how many points have been deducted (might be through vic roads??) but not sure if it only works for full license drivers and also doesn’t answer this q 

I imagine it probably wouldn’t push them back, though, but I’m honestly not sure"
harrystyles,fei4zxs,t1_fei4k1n,1579130411.0,Scratch that I did get an email! It just got buried in the emails they send about the digital music download
harrystyles,fei4k1n,t3_eozih3,1579130130.0,"I think that everyone that pre ordered the vinyl before the album came out has gotten it,  but people who ordered it afterwards haven’t yet. I preordered and it took maybe one to two weeks after the album released to arrive but I got no email to say it had been shipped"
harrystyles,fei4dw1,t3_ep5wed,1579130025.0,"His name has been taken off the actual event yeah not sure what that’s about, because he confirmed performing at the brits but has said nothing about the Super Bowl thing"
harrystyles,fei44fo,t3_ep6ufr,1579129860.0,"The shipping from his websites kinda suck!! I got an email as soon as my orders shipped but it was a while before I got that email, and there was no estimate as to when it would ship in the confirmation email or anything either. When I ordered a tpwk hoodie like a year ago it only took two weeks or so but it seems like they’re falling behind on shipping Rn ):"
AskReddit,fdlf5jv,t3_elssvy,1578522692.0,I thought every mum’s name had to start with m and every dad’s name started with d because mine did

AskReddit,fcilad8,t3_eh8gs2,1577664465.0,"Sometimes the inability to understand what your body is doing. I’m not sure how to explain this, but for example feeling your heart beat and thinking it’s too fast, then freaking out and being paranoid that your heart is going too fast. Overall just paranoia and anxiety in general tbh"
Advice,fc8sub2,t1_fc3sug7,1577541359.0,I want to give you a point but I can’t figure out how!! ):
