aww,ffkdjyo,t3_eu35j4,1580021002.0,I just lover how her eyes pop against her fur. Such a gorgeous kitty with a perfect name to match.
SuicideWatch,ffkd8p2,t3_eu36gw,1580020860.0,"I hope you reconsider. While we can explain why we did what we did it wont change the fact you will be gone. He will grow up without you and whether we like it or not they will hurt for that loss. I have a 8yr, 4 yr and 3yr old and they are what keeps me going. I've lost everything and could again and as much as I desperately wanna give up I keep going one day at a time. You have so much to offer him even at your lowest point you are amazing in his eyes. Nothing is worth you leaving him nothing. Stay strong and I hope you dont give into the desire to end it all."
FuckYouKaren,ffk5x2m,t1_ffjvmh8,1580016919.0,That's great serves her right.
FuckYouKaren,ffhmdx8,t3_etjh4w,1579942217.0,Anyone know if this Karen was fired or reprimanded???
FuckYouKaren,ffhm9ss,t3_et4esj,1579942048.0,I hate when people block the isle talking. Makes me so mad. I often times make room for carts to pass if someone else is stopped searching dor something while I search for something on the opposite side. Respect....most of us dont want to stay at the store more than we have too.....
SuicideWatch,ffhbq0x,t1_ffhawdf,1579929087.0,I honestly needed to hear this tonight. Thanks for the hallmark.
cats,ffbbe58,t3_esom9b,1579758438.0,I'd say shes a calico. My torti only has maybe an inch of white on her chest. Shes black and orange all over her body. Your girl is beautiful tho!! Great photo
cats,ffanitg,t1_ff9whvq,1579740115.0,Tucker. The shelter calls him Tristan
cats,ffanhqu,t1_ff9zaj3,1579740094.0,This is at the shelter. I plan on picking him up Wednesday
cats,ff9h1be,t1_ff7nbw5,1579712844.0,Your welcome and thank you for sharing such a beautiful photo of you kitty.
cats,ff7n97f,t3_es40jx,1579653611.0,So beautiful I have a fondness of tortis I myself have one of my own and she too has so much attitude.
cats,ff4vi3b,t3_ere8ga,1579573434.0,I'm so sorry for your loss!! I can only imagine how heartbroken you were to lose the 4 at once. I'm glad you were able to find the one that ran away she is a beautiful cat.
cats,fezwwx8,t3_eqz30j,1579462731.0,What a gorgeous photo!
cat,fexth3j,t1_fexdbah,1579435772.0,No she tried playing with her brother and then moved away when he didnt wanna play lol
cats,fevgni8,t1_fetn6sg,1579397165.0,Right!!! I just love them to bits. There siblings and they love snuggling and play fighting together
cat,feq1sp1,t1_feq0z7r,1579336242.0,"Thank you. I have another a siamese as well. Alanna (in the photo) is just more comforting than him. All my animals are esa, so I feel lost like I'm missing something important. I explained to my oldest we need to grieve. I'm glad your brother didnt have lasting damage. I wonder if mine was anxious were living at my dads due to financial issues. I could handle anything but going after my kids. She would go after my dad (never full biting him but being aggressive and nipping) and I'd still be willing to train her etc to stop the behavior. I never gave up on her and I never will. I pray she finds her  very special home meant for her soon that spoils her rotten. I agree its extremely hard to trust. My oldest wanted to say goodbye like hug her and I refused imagining him going to hug her and her biting snarling at him. I do miss her tho. Did your mom miss your dog?"
cat,fepvd05,t3_eqbesi,1579332638.0,"We had our dog for 2 years. Unfortunately recently she became more and more aggressive starting with strangers in our home. It ended with her biting my child in the face in an aggressive manner the other night. Thankfully no injuries besides soreness. I was able to react fast enough to deter her away. We had adopted her and knew she had some problems mostly of being afraid of strangers however she was also a German shepherd mixed with a golden retriever both known to be aggressive (checked with our vet). We tried to help her by training her but we never got the full chance to before she hurt my child. I've had my cats for several months now and our dog was great with them surprisingly. So my alana was snuggling with me today because I've been a mess today. I'd rather see our beloved dog find a person or couple who can get her trained for her behavior and who dont have kids. Our training would have cost 1000 which we dont have right now and I couldnt keep her to wait and get it with my kids in the home. However i also couldnt bring myself to euthanize her either because she really is an amazing dog once you got to know her and she was extremely loyal to myself and my husband. Today was the day we returned her and it's been a wreck crying off and on, explaining to my oldest (one attacked) shes gone which he broke down not wanting her gone etc. I just couldn't wait till she managed to injure him or my toddlers worse to the point of euthanizing and traumatizing them and deforming them because were being selfish wanting to keep her. Sorry this is so long....."
FFVIIRemake,fepcits,t3_eq82l4,1579317167.0,I got mine also handled glad they sent the email.
entitledparents,feilnfq,t3_ep9v68,1579141425.0,My husband's cat got attacked in her own backyard as well when 2 dogs got loose. He was heartbroken over it. They should be ashamed of themselves because their carelessness caused another family anguish and probably traumatized a child!!!
FFVIIRemake,fedtorh,t3_eolnue,1579019670.0,Gives me more time to save up and get my preorder paid off. I'm glad they are choosing to delay it to make sire it's the best it can be rather than not and have to patch it etc. Sucks tho for those that put in vacation amd can't reschedule it
aww,fe073co,t3_eni7zm,1578804775.0,Both are absolutely adorable but I love the winter poof
JUSTNOMIL,fe04bb3,t3_en9jq2,1578802731.0,I'd tell him ok go alone with them. I'd tell him if they want to come at all then I'm out. I dont care if they choose to get a hotel to accommodate me still not coming. Its supposed to be a romantic vacation and this is NOT romantic at all.... stand your ground that is absolutely ridiculous and how dare she invite herself to your FRIENDS cabin. Not your husband's place to allow it. I'm sure the OTHER couples would also be uncomfortable as well.
AsOneAfterInfidelity,fdmijnb,t3_em3vf3,1578551163.0,My ap was a stranger. Safe to say I am disgusted and want nothing to do with him. He contacted me a few weeks after d-day and I was so angry. My husband and I are only a few months in and I wanted to reconcile and I am so thankful he is wanting to as well. I know we have a long road and I have a lot to do to reconcile.
FFVIIRemake,fdkdaoy,t1_fdjrntt,1578501446.0,I'll be using lots of napkins and wipes. I love gaming with wings. I used to play l4d with my bff with wings game night. It's a major cherished memory and so love the thought of including wings to my favorite game.
FFVIIRemake,fdipiw7,t3_eldkux,1578448142.0,I wanna get a bunch of wings and my favorite soda and gorge myself on food and enjoy the game
FFVIIRemake,fd507oq,t1_fd4uxs9,1578172849.0,Damn!!! I'm so glad I missed that demo. That's fucked up!! I hate that someone did this!!! Its one thing to leak the demo but to basically ruin the entire release of the game due to how much has been leaked is fucked up!!!
FFVIIRemake,fcwiq1u,t3_ej7u1l,1578026696.0,I honestly have avoided the demo. I understand why he feels sad. This game has been a long time coming and while we are super excited I'm sure they are way more excited to see our reaction when they themselves let the demo and game out. It's hard work from them and the demo release was stolen and shown ahead of schedule. As fans we need to remember the hard work that has gone to making this game and while being excited  not go overboard by doing such things like leaking the demo. I hope he feels a little better that we feel bad someone did this and appreciate the hard work everyone has done. Glad you posted this to remind us who is behind all of this because I'm sure it's not just him feeling sad either.
Paranormal,f8d9lbx,t3_e01rj3,1574482543.0,The only time I believe I astral projected was when I was pregnant with my first child. I vividly remember seeing my sleeping for in my dark room. I looked around the room to a corner. I saw glowing red eyes and a creepy mouth turning into a grin. I was so scared I jolted awake and ran screaming form the room. I felt like I was in mortal danger. To this day I never understood what I saw or why I could see myself.i felt like I was floating free the short time I spent that way.
