Don't try to heal yourself. Boom! Nah, not gonna happen. Over time the feeling of being happy will be easier to live with. That's what I do want for you. Just to know it's ok to be happy.

Your definitely not the same person when you started meditation. Take a day and think about your growth. I promise you'll like the majority of what you see. 

I love that fact your coming from Mindfulness meditation. You have a solid center. Remember this. Let your heart and breath be your source of strength. As you grow, age, understand and become wise there are centuries of paths taken for you. Learn, grow become stronger then, one day, set your own path for those to come.
