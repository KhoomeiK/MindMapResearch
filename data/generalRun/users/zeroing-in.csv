Jokes,ffjbloc,t1_ffjae0e,1579994880.0,"Woman went to the pharmacy to fill a prescription for a skin cream, and the pharmacist told her, “When you rub this in your armpits, keep your elbows up for about 10 minutes while it dries.” The woman says, “Oh, no, it’s for my schnauzer.” The pharmacist says, “Oh, in that case, don’t ride a bicycle for awhile.”"
DoesAnybodyElse,ffj9h4v,t1_ffiis7r,1579993576.0,"In fact, it’s happening here on Reddit. On FB, my jokes weren’t getting the responses I thought they would, so I joined r/oneliners and a couple other joke subreddits thinking, “Surely with thousands more readers than my measly friend list, my jokes should get the reactions I’m hoping for. Well, one did (about 540+ upvotes), but the rest aren’t anywhere *near* that close. Single digits and very low double-digits. So I’ve come to the conclusion that my jokes are just not as funny as “my circle” has led me to believe. And if I can’t make folks laugh, I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.

tl;dr:  I’m not that funny, I hate that I’m not that funny, and I need professional therapy!"
