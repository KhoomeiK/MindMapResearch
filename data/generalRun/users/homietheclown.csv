Depression, self loathing, body image problems, social anxiety etc are all real things that can be very difficult to break. The thing is though, they're not special in that regard, not by a long shot. Millions of people suffer from those exact same conditions but without their toxic mindset. Unfortunately this mindset has become an entire identity for some of them. And that's going to be difficult to reprogram."

Your brain is **LYING** to you, it wants alcohol and will use every dirty trick in the book to get what it wants. At one point in my early sobriety I caught my brain just straight up making up fake memories and feelings to try and trick me into drinking. That's when I realized just how much utter bullshit my brain was willing to put me through to get some alcohol. Don't listen to those thoughts, drinking now will not make anything better."

It's 100% my choice to have that first drink or not, that's completely within my power no matter the situation I'm in. If I make the *choice* to have that first drink. I've now surrendered that power and choice, and the alcohol now has the power over me.

In my early days I would have this saying that I would tell people if they asked what being an alcoholic was like, and it was ""One is too many, and one hundred is never enough""

I've had exactly one drinking dream, and even that one took place in outer space with wacky shit going on. I was guilty about breaking sobriety in the dream, but as soon as I woke up there was no guilt or anything.

My worst dreams are the very rare completely normal ones when I dream about being at work. I've ended up confusing myself in real life more than once, forgetting to do a task while at work because I thought I had already done it. When the truth is I had only dreamed that it had done it. The worst one was dreaming about work the entire night, it felt like I had put a full day in, every detail felt real, right down to my smoke breaks and commute. Then I woke up and had to go into work and put a full day in. It really felt like I worked a double shift that day."

There was a moment where the light switch in my head flipped to the on position, and I realized that the reason I never could get sober before was because I was treating sobriety as a passive thing. I was sitting around doing nothing and waiting for sobriety to come to *me*. If I wanted to get sober I couldn't just sit there and wait for it, I had to get off my ass,  reach out and grab it by the balls. If I want to stay sober I have to keep a tight grip on them balls, and work on my shit so that I don't put myself in a position to let go."

IncelTears,ffeoczp,t1_ffelzyz,1579857208.0,"I probably should have phrased it differently. What I think is happening is that some pedophiles are adopting the Incel community and mindset as a justification for their own thoughts and/or actions. And some Incels are adopting the idea that young girls are the way out. These ideas are being latched onto by the vocal/influential ones and filtering down into the general community,  creating a mindset where ""training"" girls before puberty or early puberty is a desirable thing to do. Get em before they become ""evil foids"". The general trend of the Incel ideology had been moving towards the acceptable age of the girls being younger and younger, before they can be corrupted by society and by Chad. 

The line being blurry is that both communities seem to have found a common enemy, older girls and young women who are not ""innocent and pure"". They seem to feed off of each other, and these toxic ideas are being spread and being accepted, or at the very least not discouraged, by the Incel community in general."
IncelTears,ffelgy8,t3_et69yd,1579853088.0,"I'm just going to go with the numbers mentioned, as the whole dismissal of rape is just beyond my capability to respond rationally.

Now I'm just pulling numbers out of my ass here with zero research or even basic googling, if it's good enough for him it's good enough for me.


1000 different men a year eh? Ok, let's go with that. That's 2-4 *different* men every single day. And that's the average! 

Ok, so there's about 8 billion people on Earth, with pretty much a 50/50 split between male and female. So that's 4 billion female members of the human race on the planet. If I exclude everyone who is underage, or past ""Incel prime"" I'm going pull a number out of my ass and say there's 1 billion ""prime"" women fucking an average of 1000 different men a year. 

That's 1 Trillion instances of sex happening per year from one billion women. If those billion women are only fucking chads, then I feel sorry for those guys as their dicks are probably ready to fall off.  Even if you expanded that to every male on the planet that's say 16 or older, that's what, say 3 billion men?  That's an average of getting laid 333 times a year (with different women every time mind you), for *every guy* on the planet 16 or older.  If the members he pulled out of his ass were true, then he must be a real sad sack of shit for not getting laid at least once in his life. And that's just from ""prime"" foids, if I included every woman of legal age that number increases dramatically. 

I find it amusing that every time one of them makes up extreme numbers like this, it just makes them look worse and even more pathetic than they are.

Edit: realized I said ""members"" instead of ""numbers"" at one point. I'm leaving it as is because when re-reading it the amount of members he's pulling out of his ass made me chuckle."

But that's just me, and I realize that I'm not everyone in AA. Maybe telling that story helps the person remember where they were in life, and motivates them to not drink. Maybe there's someone else there who hears the story and thinks ""He might as well be talking about me, where I am right now, and if he can bounce back from that shit then so can I!""

He told us to quit rehab, go back to drinking and only come back to AA when we were desperate enough to do it the ""right"" way. Never went back to that particular meeting, but luckily I live in a big city so I can't throw a rock without hitting a meeting, and so far that's been the only instance where I've seen someone gatekeep AA."
