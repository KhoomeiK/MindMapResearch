Paladins,ff5ipyh,t3_erod0y,1579594715.0,Shouldn't we be happy about getting the old VGS key combo back? I used those lines too but I guess I can sacrifice them for old vgs key combo.
Paladins,ff5ihjh,t1_ff472tg,1579594403.0,"I don't think they will bring back ""Nice Job"", ""Quiet"" etc. May be because they don't contribute to the gameplay or strategically. Besided may be they think those (nice job, quiet) are kinda rude vgs as we use them sarcastically."

Paladins,fenh7oj,t3_eq1ig4,1579284621.0,I don't actually believe in loading screens tho. Last time I got into a similar situation. We had all the fancy frames. Guess which team got their ass wiped with the fancy frames?
Paladins,fenh0a2,t3_epz191,1579284495.0,I hated the new VGS but I am getting used to it tho. But it would be great if the *woohoo* and *awesome* lines were two separate option. And I want my **Quiet** and **Nice Job** back.
