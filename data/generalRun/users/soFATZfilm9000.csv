todayilearned,ffbm6km,t1_ffbilm4,1579772222.0,"I once saw a snake trying to have sex with itself. I have a male and female corn snake and I put them together to see if they would bang. The male tried to bang the female by trying to climb along her back until their genitals were lined up. The thing is, the female kept trying to get away. They ended up in a corner all sort of coiled up in a ball, with the male's head resting on his *own* back. At this point, the female was like, ""nope"" and got out of there.

The male didn't notice that the female left, though. He's sitting there in an ouroboros-type circle with his own head resting along his own back. As soon as he moved, his head thought that the (now not-present) female was moving. So now the snake tries to chase after ""her"". Except that ""her"" is actually ""himself"". So the more that he tries to chase the female, the more that the female keeps trying to get away from him. Which obviously makes him try harder to catch the female. So he's just going around in a circle like a dog chasing his own tail. The whole time, he's chasing himself in order to bang himself, and he doesn't even realize it. 

Eventually he figured out something was wrong, but it must have taken him about 15 minutes to realize his mistake. In the meantime, he's just going round-and-round in circles like a particularly dumb cat chasing his own tail. 

So yeah, a lot of snakes aren't particularly smart.

I once had a cat that would chase its own tail too. And I know that there's no objective means for measuring cat intelligence. But sometimes, if you are looking at a particularly stupid cat, *you can just tell* that it's stupid. Anyway, this cat would similarly just go round and round in circles trying to catch its tail. On at least three occasions, I saw it actually *catch* its tail. Claws out and everything. The cat would then yelp in pain and then sit there looking around like, ""who just did that to me?"""

A great and loving life where you touch the world and everyone is better because of it is almost like a damn *miracle* if the end result is total non-existence. Like, this tiny span of time is all you get, *but look at what you did with it.*

If I exist for millions of years (or, like, an eternity) after I die, then what does life even matter? My life, and everything that I do during my life, would just be an inconsequentially tiny moment within my *existence*. During life I could be the worst person possible.

I'm an atheist, but I'm not going to pretend that I *know* what happens after we die. But I do *believe* that a lot of people believe what they *want* to believe. And I'm probably no exception.

Sure, a lot of non-native species can't straight up kill you, but many of them potentially can cause massive environmental problems (up to and including the total devastation of an area's agriculture, or eradication of entire native *species*). 

Again, I'm not saying that's not a problem. But that's an issue of legislation. If their potential to become invasive is big enough, then they should be banned by law.

todayilearned,fejekf5,t1_fejdxrg,1579170286.0,"Most beta fish die from neglect. An absolute shitload of turtles and iguanas have died from neglect because they were being sold cheap as hell and the people buying them didn't *care* enough to keep them from dying. That happens with a lot of animals, but doesn't necessarily mean that proper care isn't *known* or *within the means of the average person*. That's still a problem, but that's a different problem than *they shouldn't ever be sold*. 

Keep in mind that this doesn't mean there shouldn't be restrictions on selling them. Freaking cobras are legal to own in the USA (varies by state), but my understanding is that it requires a permit. And that a permit means consent to allow for inspection of the facilities. And that *if* the animal escapes and then hurts someone, that's on the owner *because they knew exactly what they were dealing with when they got the animal.* In an ideal world I'd think that selling blue ringed octopi should work the same way. 

But keep in mind, that's different than *no one should have them.* Most captive blue-ringed octopi aren't killing anyone, most peoples' pet cobras aren't killing anyone either. There's an argument to be made that they can't be ethically sold if *literally no one knows how to provide proper captive care.* But escape shouldn't really be an argument against owning them. They're not magical animals that can defy the laws of physics. If you put them somewhere where they can't escape, *then they can't escape.*"

Still, the point kind of remains that a lot of animals require *specialized* care and do okay *if* their needs are met. If there's a *known* way to properly care for them in captivity, then it's ultimately the owner's job to account for that. Even if overall proper care is an unknown, escapes shouldn't factor into that. Escape is a known issue. You either account for every possible method of escape, or you don't get the animal. And it's the seller's job to state this, and the buyer's job to be responsible for their own tank setup. 

I'm willing to bet that out of all the pet owners who have owned blue-ringed octopi, only a small percentage have died by accidentally stepping on one in the middle of the night. Same with venomous snakes or large potentially deadly boas and pythons. There's definitely a risk, but *most* people who knowingly take on that risk end up fine.

Having said that, I don't really see the *point* of buying a blue-ringed octopus ""because they are so beautiful."" The blue rings are a threat display.

That his mission when he first arrived was to steal the Ring and bring it back to Gondor? 

I don't know if there was any canonical basis for that in the books, but I didn't really like that new revelation.

People then get infected from breathing in spores, and that kicks off the events which lead to all the other deaths. 

People complained about the same thing years earlier in Prometheus, but it's even worse in the next movie. At least in Prometheus, it could be argued that the planet was thought to be lifeless (if we ignore the fact that they were venturing into alien-made ruins). In the next movie, the planet is *clearly* teaming with life. Not only that, but it contains *life from Earth*. Which means that someone brought it there.

movies,fe7076h,t1_fe6tdy7,1578908313.0,"I think one of the things that annoyed me about it (not the only thing) is how the plot sort of *required* the military to be so stupid. It's easy to think that in previous movies Weyland-Yutani was simply in over their heads because they didn't yet know what they were really dealing with, or that they couldn't maintain adequate security because the whole operation was supposed to be secret. After all, it's not exactly as if they could have placed dozens of armed soldiers on civilian ships/bases (The Nostromo/Hadley's Hope) without drawing way too much suspicion. 

But didn't Resurrection actually take place on a military base? Sure, what they were doing was still *illegal*. But by this point they clearly knew what they were dealing with. And they were dealing with *maybe* a couple dozen Aliens at most. There should be no reason to not have enough soldiers onboard to deal with that. 

Hell, the escape shouldn't have been possible either. By this point, the scientists definitely knew that the Aliens have acid for blood, so it's beyond stupid that the Aliens were being held in containers that *could be melted through by the Aliens' acid*. But even ignoring that, the very first thing that the soldiers do upon the Aliens' escape *is to flee*. 

I realize that many movies wouldn't happen if the characters didn't make stupid decisions, but this seems like a particularly annoying example to me. I have the same criticism of Jurassic Park but at least in that movie there's a *reason* (it was the first attempt, the park wasn't fully staffed yet, and many of the staff evacuated due to the imminent hurricane). In Alien Resurrection, the entire movie is based on stupid decisions that never should have happened. Even worse, the characters in hindsight should have been prepared for *exactly* this scenario because this is the *exact* same type of shit that they knew had already previously happened."

I mean, was using male photographers actually causing a problem for the models? Were the male photographers doing anything inappropriate to cause the models to feel uncomfortable? Were the photographers totally professional but many of the models felt uncomfortable anyway? Was there not a problem at all, but this is instead a preemptive attempt to avoid any *appearance* of impropriety? 

I'm just a little bit curious as to the reasons for this. I was never big into Playboy (the articles or the pictures), so I feel like I'm lacking some historical context. The little bit that I have seen of Playboy, the pictures seemed mostly tasteful. Sure, they were definitely erotic and clearly targeted towards heterosexual men, but it seemed well done and certainly not what I'd call *smut*. And I've never personally heard about a trend of models being treated badly, particularly by the male photographers.

Or Just walking down the street with a python draped over them? I think I once read about a woman who owned an albino alligator. She'd take the alligator shopping with her, and even installed an alligator seat on her motorcycle so she could take her alligator on motorcycle rides. 

I just wonder if this is anything like that. It's probably not, but I wonder if it is.

Also, in the original comics it seems that (at least mild) psychic powers are actually real. Ozymandias' Alien Squid unleashed a *very real* psychic blast upon its death. And it is made very clear that the Squid's brain was cloned and amplified from an actual ""psychic"". Granted, this psychic whose head was stolen was probably a low-level psychic. Probably on the level of Looking Glass (if Looking Glass actually does have a small level of extra-normal abilities). So yeah, I think it's at least plausible that Looking Glass just naturally does have a *small* natural ability to tell when people are lying.

Alternatively, he might not be any better at it than any random person. Which would mean that when he uses his ""racism detector"" that a lot of innocent suspects are getting royally screwed just because of the word of a masked police officer who everyone just *assumes* can actually assess peoples' guilt. In any case, I suspect that the efficacy of the polygraph machine has undergone much more thorough scientific scrutiny than that of Looking Glass' abilities.

Personally I think it's plausible that he might have *some* actual degree of psychic abilities. Even if that's the case, I also don't think that's really the relevant issue. The relevant issue is that masked police officers are violating peoples' civil rights based on the words of an anonymous detective who *might* have *minor* psychic abilities. The biggest issue isn't his ability to be right, the biggest issue is his ability to be *wrong*.

Watchmen,fd11ubv,t1_fd0iry8,1578126629.0,"Just out of curiosity, can you expand on the lithium thing? 

In the original comic series, the only mention of lithium that I recall seeing was about Dr. Manhattan making mass-produced electric cars possible because there wasn't enough lithium available. So instead, Dr. Manhattan simply *made more lithium*.

Was there any other mention of lithium mentioned in the original comics? Because if there was, I can't recall. 

Coming up to the new TV series, I noticed when 7th Kavalry specifically tried to escape with *old lithium batteries which have since been banned.* I don't recall ever realizing exactly what that was about. At the time I *assumed* that those ""old lithium batteries"" were banned because they were made by Dr. Manhattan. And that the lithium batteries made by Dr. Manhattan were banned because people *thought* that Dr. Manhattan gives people cancer. 

But this brings up the question: does Dr. Manhattan *actually* have any specific vulnerabilities to lithium? Does the lithium that Dr. Manhattan made *actually* have any different properties than naturally occurring lithium? 

That whole point is a little bit unclear to me. How exactly does the lithium thing work? Can you point out the canon which explains this in more depth? I like to not usually get too bogged down in fictional sci-fi mumbo jumbo. But I was under the impression that the TV series only treats the original comic series as canon. And I don't recall the original comic series mentioning anything about lithium other than Dr. Manhattan making a whole lot of it in order to make electric vehicles viable. Is there anything in canon actually establishing that he has a weakness to lithium OR that the lithium which he made has different properties than naturally occurring lithium?

I ask this because it sort of brings up a question about the original comics. If the lithium made by Dr. Manhattan is different from naturally occurring lithium, and if that lithium is now banned, is that synthetic lithium *actually* dangerous to people? If that lithium is actually dangerous to people (and different enough from natural lithium to allow for actually capturing a god such as Dr. Manhattan), *then what does that say about the original Dr. Manhattan cancer scare?* Would this validate the notion that exposure to Dr. Manhattan actually *does* cause cancer?"
Watchmen,fd0qpy3,t1_fcyrc3v,1578122478.0,"In the case of Watchmen, I actually think that the in-universe explanation is relevant. I mean, it's a cold war era story in which the world is on the brink of being annihilated due to the conflict between the USA and the Soviet Union. Technology is tied into that, and Dr. Manhattan is sort of an extreme example of the atomic bomb. The USA couldn't keep that technology secret once the genie was out of the bottle, so I think it's logical to question why the same would apply to Dr. Manhattan. 

The thing about the comics is that they don't have to explain why the technology or the process can't be repeated. The very nature of Dr. Manhattan being a *sentient* atomic bomb means that the experiment likely *wouldn't* be repeated (or at least not attempted more than a few times). You can't force people to do it, it's implied that most people aren't smart or well-educated enough to ""survive"", and it would be a waste for a country to continually vaporize its own scientists. The setup itself is implicitly enough reason why there has still only been one Dr. Manhattan. There is really not even a need to dive into the fictional tech.

The thing about the TV series though is that it >!*does* focus on making another Dr. Manhattan.!< That whole scenario was best left in a bottle, I think. Because now that is reopening this issue from a ""why did the writers make it that way"" standpoint. And now that the writers *have* ""made it that way"", it's sort of valid to revisit the in-universe logic to see if the writers' decisions hold up.

And honestly, the more I think about it, I'm of the opinion that >!bringing Dr. Manhattan into the series (and particularly, having the big conflict be about preventing/making another Dr. Manhattan)!< was a misstep. There was plenty of very compelling material to sustain a miniseries without opening up that bag of worms. And I feel like going in that direction opens up a lot of issues that were better left alone. Heck, even the issue of >!whether or not Keen or Trieu should be able to have Dr. Manhattan's power was already sort of the same theme as the cops wearing masks. The Dr. Manhattan climax sort of feels like an unneeded and less interesting version of the power/accountability theme which was already in play from episode 1.!<"
Watchmen,fd0kpu5,t1_fcxq5cx,1578120211.0,"I'd actually be surprised if it were tried more than a few times. I mean, the test subject must be a willing participant. You can't force someone to undergo the procedure, because the entire point is to *basically turn them into a god.* If you force someone to do it, *and then it actually works*, then you're in big freaking trouble because now you have a *god* who's extremely pissed off about you vaporizing him. 

The test subject sort of has to be a willing participant. And I'd wager that most suitable people (sane, reasonably intelligent people with an understanding of physics and anatomy) would nope right out of that. They'll *definitely* be vaporized and only *might* be able to reassemble themselves. And it quite possibly might be *worse than death*. If Dr. Manhattan reassembled himself, that implies that he maintained consciousness *after his ""death"".* So failure to reassemble oneself might result in a powerless bodiless free-floating mind existing for the rest of eternity. It wouldn't surprise me that not too many people would be willing to sign up for that."
Watchmen,fcwyn0h,t1_fcwx3mk,1578043276.0,"Again, not disagreeing with you. I was just wondering if there was some in-universe reason why it wouldn't *work* again. Especially after we've seen it work once (so we know it CAN work), and it worked on the very first person to undergo the ""accident"". 

>!The reason I ask relates to to plot of the TV show. >!Specifically, Lady Trieu's attempts to become another Dr. Manhattan by siphoning off his power. Isn't that kind of a dumb plan? Not only because that requires *capturing Dr. Manhattan*, but also because *she can't possibly know that THAT will work either*?!<

>!Wouldn't it make more sense from a supervillain standpoint to just build another intrinsic field device and *independently* become a god without Manhattan's involvement? Yeah, yeah...there's no guarantee it would work. But at least it's been established that it *could* work. What she tried in the show has *never* been shown to work. She doesn't even know that it's *possible*.!<

>!Doesn't it make the most sense to just recreate the Gila Flats accident and then trust that she's smart enough to reassemble herself? I mean, if *anyone* on Earth is smart enough to prepare themselves for the procedure (and have a backup via clones and memory preservation in case the procedure fails), then it's her. By all indications, the *smarter* plan is to just try to recreate the Gila Flats incident and hope it works again. Is hubris (in the form of destroying a god in the process) really the *only* reason she opts for the dumber and far less reliable plan? If so, that's ridiculously cartoonish.!<

Crap, sorry about the bad spoiler tags! I've got them fixed now, I hope I didn't spoil things for anyone before they got fixed."
Watchmen,fcwwkiy,t1_fcwuf2t,1578040666.0,"Not disagreeing with you about that cheapening the impact of the original material, but I was more asking about comic lore.

Yes, I'm sure that Bubastis couldn't come back as a cat-god, but that's because Bubastis is a cat. Cats don't have the intelligence to understand particle physics or anatomy, and so almost certainly wouldn't be able to reassemble itself even if its ""intrinsic field"" was floating around with a degree of consciousness.

But Jon Osterman was a human. Just a normal (albeit very intelligent and well-educated) human. It stands to reason that a human *can* reassemble his/herself after having one's intrinsic field separated from one's body. It actually *worked* on the only human who has actually gone through the process. 

So why wouldn't it conceivably work again? I realize that it would weaken the thematic impact if it happened again. I realize that there's a very good in-universe reason why the attempt wouldn't be made. But is there any in-universe reason why it wouldn't *work*?

Yes, Jon Osterman was very intelligent and very well-educated and had a very good idea of how things worked. That's how he was able to put himself back together and to learn to manipulate matter and energy. And I'm sure someone who is no smarter than me wouldn't be able to reassemble themselves after being vaporized in the intrinsic field device. But if you were to take a brilliant scientist with a great understanding of anatomy and physics and then vaporize that person in the intrinsic field device, why wouldn't that work? 

Yeah, it would surely be wasteful to take a country's best and brightest people and just start vaporizing them in the hopes of creating a god. People that brilliant would probably be better used in other capacities. But there was nothing particularly special about Jon Osterman before the accident. He wasn't a superman prior to the accident, he was just an intelligent man who understood clocks and physics. That's not exactly *unrepeatable*, is it?"

Entomology,fctdami,t1_fctcpry,1577939644.0,"Thanks! 

I'm assuming that the reasons mantids get banned is specifically because they'd be more likely to eat *pollinating* insects. Is that correct?"
insects,fc7uw40,t1_fc7tyh1,1577519259.0,"I was actually thinking about the plants ""confirmed to be safe"". Like, the only stick insect I've ever raised was Anisomorpha buprestoides. All the care sheets I've seen say that oak and rhododendron are acceptable safe plants. But after trying them out, the only plants I've actually noticed them eating were blackberry. 

Of course, after getting them to eat blackberry I just kept feeding them blackberry since I knew they would take it. Once I found a food they would actually eat, I just kept feeding them that food since I knew they would eat it. What I *haven't* done is try keeping a portion of them on a safe/acceptable food that they don't like, and seeing if they live.

Anyway, if I ever raise Anisomorpha buprestoides again I might try that out. Just keep certain groups certain plants that are *supposed* to be safe. And then just record how those groups do."
Entomology,fc7u605,t1_fc6zeez,1577518717.0,"Do you happen to know why some species aren't banned except by permit? What are the criteria for determining which species are allowed and which aren't? 

I'm just wondering, because things such as tarantulas and giant terrifying centipedes seem to be perfectly okay. But orchid mantises are banned. I understand the concern about the mantids: you want to avoid introducing potentially invasive species. What I don't understand is why some species get a pass but not others. Centipedes are a good example. Is there any real reason why giant Vietnamese centipedes *couldn't* become established in the USA (especially the southern USA)? Not that I particularly want them to be banned by federal law, but why *aren't* they banned by federal law? 

The same goes for vertebrates too. Especially with the invasive species that have showed up in Florida, why are there so many foreign snakes/lizards/turtles that aren't (federally) illegal to own? Aren't there a good number of them that *could* potentially become established in the USA (even if it hasn't happened yet)?

I'm just trying to understand the *reason* behind the laws. Invasive species are actually potentially a huge concern, so why are so many foreign species *not* banned?"
insects,fc7pzr5,t1_fc70utz,1577515631.0,"Thanks! Another question, I have. I have seen comments from some people saying things like, ""everyone says this species eats X, but mine won't touch it; mine only eat Y.""

In the above scenario, will that *particular* insect likely eat X if it gets hungry enough? Or will that *particular* stick insect instead likely starve if it isn't offered something that it likes more?"
movies,fbnw5b0,t1_fbla8cg,1577004104.0,"Well, going by the movie's rules, that's not a terribly big problem. It's already been established that these plants need blood (specifically human blood). 

Audrey II also didn't sprout off shoots until becoming HUGE. 

And this plant is also now located in Audrey's and Seymour's yard. 

There's not really much that can happen here other than Audrey and Seymour seeing the plant and then immediately killing it before it can become big enough to reproduce or start feeding on humans without assistance from humans. That baby plant at the end of the movie is doomed."
