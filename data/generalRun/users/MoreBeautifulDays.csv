I have one come out to do NS bags, they also can do meds like zofran etc in your bag. It‚Äôs licensed paramedics that come out where I live and they have a physician medical director. They do a little 22g IV and bring a pole and everything needed and run your fluids in your home. It was $99 for the fluids total for everything I got last time."

meatcrayon,fenydgc,t1_fenxwq0,1579292605.0,That makes sense. It‚Äôs terrible that the fear of accidentally hurting someone who is literally trying to carjack you is a real fear here. No one wants to go to court for manslaughter because they ran over some dude who was trying to carjack them but in this country much worse has happened to people :-/

nursing,fel71tp,t3_epkygj,1579215444.0,"Honestly after so long in the Er and triage when people get off track I literally say, ‚Äúthat I care less about, when did this episode of chest pain start?‚Äù I just don‚Äôt have time to fuck around with 14 more people waiting for triage and 30 in my triage waiting area waiting for beds. Get to the point or get out."
sanantonio,feeznnh,t1_feeo50s,1579044756.0,"I have to agree about LP quality, I‚Äôve been eating there for literal decades and the food has just fallen off and gotten more expensive. I ordered online and got a gallon of lemonade, FYI if they forget anything in your online order they can‚Äôt refund it. I had a friend pick up the order as she was coming to visit and no lemonade on arrival, called and he said because I paid online they can‚Äôt refund it but I could drive back that night while he was there and pick it up. 

Also, as far as tc‚Äôs is concerned I cannot stress enough how impossible it is to get extra cheese on your bean and cheese taco. I get charged every time and get home with bean tacos. It‚Äôs gotten to the point I pull over after drive thru and check, 95% of the time I go back inside and ask for the cheese I paid for, how hard is it to put extra cheese?!!"

PublicFreakout,fdwcrnu,t3_en7wxi,1578757415.0,"Soooo that means we can rip his skirt off? It‚Äôs basically the same thing, being allowed to wear what you feel is appropriate in public for whatever reason without the fear of some jerk trying to remove clothing from your person. You don‚Äôt get to touch someone else because you don‚Äôt like what they are wearing, keep your hands to yourself."
trashy,fdwcdgt,t3_en5kjo,1578757274.0,"It‚Äôs like that old meme that was going around about the uncle who brought questionable women home and made them clap when he was out of the room to know if they stole, you stop clapping then you‚Äôre stealing, makes sense when dealing with untrustworthy people like this. Glad you got your things back and it sucks that you offer someone help and they are so ungrateful."

relationship_advice,fd9xgqp,t3_ek7tvr,1578239148.0,"I feel you, my mom committed suicide August 22nd, I just screamed when my sister called me but I don‚Äôt remember much else while my husband drove me to my parents home, most of that day was a blur. I was able to take 2 weeks off work which helped, I didn‚Äôt do well alone so I always had someone with me for those 2 weeks, I just stared blankly a lot while I tried to reconcile what had happened. I saw my therapist which helped me just get the words out to a non involved party, I talked about it as much as I could which helped me work through a lot of it, it‚Äôs still hard but I‚Äôm pretty much ok now, dealing with her things was impossible so my sisters did it and are working through her things still in my parents house, she was a bit of a hoarder (my sisters are a half sister from my bio father and a step sister from my step dad, I was my mothers only child) so it‚Äôs a little easier for them. I have a hard time going to my parents house which is weird because we live on the same property. Basically there is no instruction manual for this you just kind of exist and feel really 1D till things start to go back to normal a little and you slowly get back into your life. I had to accept my mom decided to take herself out of my life, it wasn‚Äôt her fault and I don‚Äôt blame her but it is the facts and that helped me grasp I needed to move forward in my life for my family because my mom made that choice, she isn‚Äôt here with me. That sounds harsh but it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been able to accept it and live with it. You are going to feel like you‚Äôre walking around with this huge gaping wound no one else can see but it‚Äôs very much thereto you, slowly that starts to scab over and it gets a little easier. I have a hard time still with shoes about people‚Äôs mom, I loved grace and Frankie but it‚Äôs harder to watch now, I watch a lot of Frasier because their mother passed away so there is less mom references. The first holidays were a nightmare but I just trudged on, there wasn‚Äôt anything else to do but move forward, even if you don‚Äôt want to life will make you keep on moving, school, work, chores, they all still exist and have to be done, it helps. If you need an ear PM me anytime, it‚Äôs a horrible club we‚Äôre in now but there are other members who have walked this path before and can help, dont go it alone."

PublicFreakout,fcs50yq,t1_fcs2xd1,1577911558.0,"I wonder if he decided to not wear a ring at all of it would help curb people trying to kiss his hand since they seem to be trying to go for the ring. I do understand not wanting your hands kissed especially for someone of his advanced age, older people are so much more susceptible to things and their recovery is often much harder."
PublicFreakout,fcs4rqm,t1_fcs2xd1,1577911455.0,"Oh wow, yeah he really didn‚Äôt go in for the traditional pope dress, I‚Äôve only seen him in the white that he is wearing in the second pic. Not being familiar I assumed the other attire was utilized more a long time ago I didn‚Äôt realize it had been used recently. Like the white was a more modern style that was more functional, which I could understand because the other seems like it would be very difficult to move around in. I honestly think the hat alone would cause issues when moving through a crowd and trying to cut through swiftly. I guess if he was mostly sitting it wouldn‚Äôt be too bad but pope Francis seems like he moves around a lot, every video I see he is more mobile than I remember seeing popes prior being."
PublicFreakout,fcs2ahq,t1_fcs22f5,1577910373.0,"Ok cool, so it‚Äôs kind of an aging tradition that isn‚Äôt really done much anymore but is still out there. I can see wanting to do away with that and not wanting peoples mouths near your hands. I‚Äôm at Er nurse and I wouldn‚Äôt want that either, I totally get it."
PublicFreakout,fcs0elq,t1_fcrp5ia,1577909414.0,"Wow he really doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not super familiar with the protocol here but is that like a regular thing that people do with popes? If so, is it weird he is so awkward with it? I mean, I wouldn‚Äôt want people touching or kissing my hands if I didn‚Äôt initiate it but if it‚Äôs like a pope tradition should he have been more accepting?"

relationship_advice,fc0zoi3,t3_efgd01,1577304093.0,"They are old enough to know better but I too don‚Äôt enjoy confrontation when my generosity is abused. I would have to speak up and say, ‚ÄúWe really appreciate the visit but only had a 3 day stretch available as we‚Äôve just moved in and have so many things to get done before we head back to work, let‚Äôs make the next 2 days count but then we‚Äôve got to get back to getting things ready for the new year and unpacked!‚Äù It kind of avoids confrontation and also let‚Äôs them know they‚Äôve got 2 days then you expect them out. If they try and stay past that you‚Äôll have to get more to the point like, ‚Äúwhat time do you guys plan to head out today so I can plan my errands around the time you leave to say goodbye.‚Äù Then hold them to it."
