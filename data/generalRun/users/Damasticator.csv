AskReddit,fevveb9,t3_eqies2,1579401945.0,"I left Vietnam with my mom in 1984. My grandfather was absolutely heartbroken, because I was really close to him. Apparently I was the only baby he ever really held and took a liking to, including his own children. I was his lucky charm during his weekly card games. When he would buy a sandwich to share with me, he'd let me eat all my favorite parts of it. 

He died shortly after we arrived in America. My family back in Vietnam said he just wasn't the same when I left. 

Years later, I went back to visit family when I was 18. We went out to my grandpa's cemetery to clean up his gravestone and pay respects. The problem is that no one remembered where his plot was exactly. I remember wandering around looking at the different headstones. I stopped to take a break. My grandma came to find me; guess in front of whose grave I was standing?"
