ElectricSkateboarding,ffdosqm,t1_ffdipve,1579825434.0,"Fair points, but I think that stating that perspective up front would make the review stronger. I also own an e-bike, but I use my X2 as my daily commute because it's a lot more fun. 

While I think you could improve its performance with some tweaks to your trucks, I think you'll enjoy your ride more if you stick to bike paths which will allow you to go full throttle. Alternatively, you can get a penny board with a kicktail which will give you maneuverability and transportability, but at the sacrifice of comfort and stability at speed.

Either way, have fun!"
ElectricSkateboarding,ffdggjv,t3_esm58d,1579820353.0,"Just curious... What other esk8s do you own? 

It seems to me like a lot of your complaints are just part of the esk8 experience (e.g. weight of the board, transportation, etc.) and that you'd prefer to ride a scooter or drive a car. As a result, your review sounds like you're comparing the Backfire X2 Ranger against all other last-mile solutions, rather than against other skateboards. I think this fact is apparent in the following statements you make in your review:

>*""Modern cars have adaptive steering, meaning that when you are in a parking lot the turning-ratio increases and you can do a tight u-turn. When the car gets to a high speed on a freeway, it decreases the turning-ratio so that your car doesn’t wander in its lane. In principle, there is no reason a skateboard couldn’t have adaptive steering""* 

>*""However, getting into reverse takes an extra hand and an extra button press, and this could have been used as a rapid turn-around option if it was designed differently.""*  (not sure what a ""rapid-turn around option"" means and how that would be desirable)

>*""Some boards are already playing with foot-mounted acceleration and braking controls, but this needs to be done carefully due to constant natural movement of the rider to stay balanced. One-Wheel should be proud of their single-object, unified design simplicity in this regard, but they have range and weight problems.""*

It's not clear to me whether you're trying to review the X2 on its own merits, or against other types of devices (i.e. scooters, cars, onewheels, snowboards, etc.). Now, I'm not exactly an X2 fanboy as I've voice my criticisms on this board and Youtube several times. However, some of your criticisms seem a bit overstated (or founded in misunderstanding). For example, as Slayblaze pointed out, your complaints about the light seem a little bit off. You dedicate the second paragraph of your ""Problems and Use Cases"" to the light, which is more of a bonus accessory than anything. Most boards do not include a light and many people supplement these lights with helmet lights if they're truly concerned about safety. Your criticism that the light cannot be used as a handle is also a bit weird, as most riders mall carry any esk8s that weigh above 20 lbs  and are not disturbed by touching a little dust on the trucks. 

Regarding the turning radius, I feel like the DKP trucks actually improve the radius significantly compared to my other esk8. Watching your video on the turning radius shows that you could be leaning into your turns a little more, but it's likely that you need to either loosen up your trucks a smidge or find more appropriate bushings for your weight. At my weight, I get a much better radius than you showed in your video.

All that being said, I enjoyed the videos you included your review and the shots of your dog. I'd be interested in seeing how your review might change after you get more used to the X2 or try out more boards. Cheers!"

Other than needing to secure the enclosure screws with blue loctite, the rest of the board has had no issues and I'm pretty happy with the experience. The only thing I would do over is get the Sanyo battery for the extended range.
