Catholicism,fgsvgk1,t1_fgsv6r9,1581093490.0,"I just graduated high school last year. There was nothing satanic about my school. It is the parents’ job to teach religion, not the school’s. There only thing one might think is “satanic” about public school is that they don’t teach religion. But they’re not supposed to. So I don’t see the problem."
Catholicism,fgsv08p,t1_fgsu2fi,1581093223.0,I went to public school for 13 years. It’s not an indoctrination center. Families are free to practice whatever faith and cultural practices they want.

Catholicism,fgstpi6,t1_fgssnkx,1581092452.0,"Frankly, I do think the argument against contraception is a spiritual one. As I’ve been taught in my religious education (and public education alluded to this as well), life begins at conception. Therefore, while abortion is killing a human life (and therefore should be seen as wrong from a secular standpoint), contraception is not, since contraception takes effect before life begins. Obviously, since we as Catholics take a vow to be open to children when we marry, the use of contraception is a sin. However, the reason it is a sin is because of a promise we have made to God, based on Catholic teachings. 

Therefore, telling a public school classroom that contraceptives are evil is akin to telling a public school classroom that everyone has a moral obligation to eat a halal diet. 

As a side note, some of the most devout practicing Catholics I know are people who went to the same public schools as I did. Public-school Catholic parents take responsibility for their kids’ religious upbringing instead of just leaving it to the school."
Catholicism,fgssdvh,t1_fgsl5ts,1581091652.0,It is generally accepted by parents who send their kids to public school that it is not the school’s job to teach religious teachings. I don’t think it would be right for a public school to censor information just because our religion prohibits it.
Catholicism,fgsj9tp,t1_fgrq1sz,1581085748.0,"That sounds uncomfortable... even in a very secular part of the US, our teachers did not touch the topic of masturbation (no pun intended), Even for kids whose religions don’t have anything against it, that’s something they can figure out on their own time."
Catholicism,fgsiyy8,t1_fgrszp8,1581085537.0,"Yes. I think withholding information is not a fair way to educate people. Would we tell kids that stealing doesn’t exist, or that premarital sex doesn’t exist, or that Protestant churches don’t exist? Of course not! Since when is it a good idea to only provide information about things the Church approves of? There’s no reason high school students should not be taught that contraception exists (besides, as someone else pointed out, birth control pills can be used to treat many non-sexual ailments as well).

Besides, the school in question is public. Happens to be majority-Catholic, but still, there are students of all faith backgrounds, and public schools have an obligation to uphold freedom of religion, so it’d be unfair to match the curriculum to any specific religion."

Also, the economy is pretty good right now; we don’t have the kind of despair that cause other countries to let fascism or communism take over. 2020 America is *lightyears* apart from 1940 Germany, and the scare tactic of comparing the two is really unnecessary.
