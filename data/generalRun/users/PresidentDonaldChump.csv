But personally I'd go with the tier box.  It's about half the price of a mythic box so you can almost get 2 boxes for the price of 1 mythic box.  And mythics aren't that hard to get through normal play."

According to Knight, Ramtha was a Lemurian warrior who fought the Atlanteans over 35,000 years ago.[19] Knight claims Ramtha speaks of leading an army over 2.5 million strong (more than twice the estimated world population at about 30,000 BC) for 63 years, and conquering three fourths of the known world (which was allegedly going through cataclysmic geological changes).

>According to Knight, Ramtha taught his soldiers everything he knew for 120 days, he bid them farewell, rose into the air and in a bright flash of light he ascended before them. Knight says he made a promise to his army he would come back to teach them everything he had learned. JZ Knight says in 1977 Ramtha appeared before her and told her he had come to help her over the ditch. JZ Knight claims to have become his first student of what she calls the great work.[19]
