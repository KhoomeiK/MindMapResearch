childfree,ffiek4w,t1_ffhjeiw,1579971989.0,"LOL this makes me laugh because I was an emergency c-section baby (and almost two months early; my mom had a lot of complications) and the doctor accidentally cut my cheek during the surgery.

Apparently I never screamed at all. I came out GLARING. 

(I still have a faint scar on my cheek from where he cut me.)"
AmItheAsshole,ffgiswp,t1_fffbjqt,1579907207.0,"Oh definitely this, especially if it's not discussed beforehand. My bestie and I have gone on vacation before and we've talked about it. We both like to do tons of shit, but if we're going for a week, then I want two days where I get to do basically nothing and just collapse on the nearest beach with a book--she doesn't want to do that. She prefers her total collapsing parts of the vacation to be at night, which is when I like to go exploring. 

And that's cool! So since we know ahead of time, we make sure we account for it and it works. But doing that to friends unexpectedly is the wooorst."
AmItheAsshole,ffdhtt3,t1_ffck8uv,1579821172.0,"I live alone with just my cat and my mom says my place is like being inside a toy box or a box of crayons and I'm 'lol, yup, I want ALL the colour'. If someone doesn't like it, tough."
AmItheAsshole,ffcn13h,t1_ffb70hm,1579802923.0,Thank you!!!!
AmItheAsshole,ffankr0,t1_ff9ayfb,1579740150.0,That's adorable and also seconding the request to know where you  got one.
SchoolIdolFestival,ff62xrf,t3_eruz8c,1579617801.0,"I'm super excited for the colour change costumes in limit break! And I love the QoL improvements they're making~

I do wish there was something about when the dailies would be getting their 3d animations though~ I want to see the Muse and Aqours girls dance their solos!"
SchoolIdolFestival,feypaoy,t3_eqvirc,1579448587.0,"ngl but I cried listening to this preview. 

It's so good and it's so Muse and I just feel so blessed. <3 <3 <3 They all sound so GOOD. <3"

All I hope for is Snow Halation Kotori omg. She's the only Snow Halation girl I'm missing~"
AmItheAsshole,feeyfbz,t1_feeja9x,1579043959.0,"Yeees to all of this. I get so mad when people are like 'spaghetti squash tastes just like the real thing!' because *no it doesn't*. I like it, it tastes good, but please don't try and pass it off as the real thing. It's not spaghetti! (I also love mashed cauliflower, but yeah, it's really, really not the same as mashed potatoes and anything saying it is--is wrong.)"
wholesomememes,fe615op,t3_enuacc,1578879466.0,"Yes, but ouch. My kitty's 19 and I'm going LA LA LA about the possibility of her dying. (she's still healthy!)"
wholesomememes,fe60y4a,t1_fe5ui5b,1578879330.0,"The first image is of a lump of coal, the second is a diamond. Pressurized coal is how diamonds are formed. So the 'she' in the picture thinks she's like coal when she's not wearing make up, but they think she's more like a diamond when not wearing it. You don't really need to know Minecraft to follow this one. :)"

AmItheAsshole,fdyqru6,t1_fdxedu7,1578782627.0,"The problem comes from being in a 'working group'. They're studying together. If a study partner is having issues and ranting, but is doing it in another language that's going to make a lot of people uncomfortable.

And it's even worse in the actual workforce. I fucking hated working retail at this one place because there were a bunch of people there who deliberately chose to speak Filipino around other employees who couldn't understand the language--to *bitch* about the other employees. It was a goddamn nightmare of a job and it made things so incredibly hostile, especially once a few of us *did* learn enough of the language to *confirm* that they really were bitching about us. 

It's rude af to use a different language when you're in a group or you're at work *while working* and not everyone can understand. It just breeds bad feelings."

SchoolIdolFestival,fdfecum,t3_ejsr22,1578359712.0,Dunno that my hands will survive but ah well. The cards are cute and I can't resist unlimited LP + the chance to gain scouting tickets.

AmItheAsshole,fdau95n,t1_fdao47s,1578250241.0,"I mean, there's some things we don't hold them to. But 'stealing is wrong' is a pretty basic thing to grasp. Little kids get that. A 17 year old certainly can."

AmItheAsshole,fczrjkp,t1_fcy6mot,1578107401.0,"Yeeees, this. I hate sharing my food. Always have, always will. I even hate going to buffets because then there's no sense of 'my' food, it's everyone's and I hate that."

fasting,fcvuovs,t3_eiy1p8,1578010514.0,"My current fav is 'The only thing standing between you and your goal is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it.'

And my thing is that frequently, my mind wants to eat and my body is fine, so I've got idek a routine where I go 'I want to eat', acknowledge it, and then go 'okay, but why? are you sad, or tired, or angry? have you had a drink recently? gotten up to stretch?' I find looking to see what's actually triggering the urge to eat, when I'm not physically hungry, helps me."
AmItheAsshole,fcvohf3,t1_fcvj5yx,1578006533.0,"I mean, I don't think anyone's saying fair in 'she should have sex with him' but I think it would be fair that if she's using a sex toy and getting off to it that he can do the same. Her argument that it's because his toy is flesh colored is just weird af because it IS super unfair of her to claim that using a sex toy is cheating when she's doing the same thing, but hers is purple."

My goals, hm... 

On my SIF JP: 

* hit rank 600 (currently 513)
* obtain any Nozomi URs that come out this year
* try that whole 'f2p' thing. (Except for Nozomi's bday pack because my queen deserves it.)

EN/WW main:

* IDEK. It's my main but it's a secondary main to my JP.

SIFAS JP: 

* Get all of Nozomi's cards released in 2020! (I have all of 2019's cards of her!)
* Hit rank 100
* blah blah blah try that whole f2p thing

I'm kind of bad at the f2p thing, which is fine, because I can afford to whale for Nozomi, but I'd like to try and give mostly f2p a go."
AmItheAsshole,fcnd097,t3_ei0hr2,1577809080.0,"Nah, nah. 13 is totally old enough to take the subway on his own--especially since you were aware he was coming and expecting him and so if he didn't show up, you'd have known right away! That's perfect for a first time use of the subway alone.

NTA."
