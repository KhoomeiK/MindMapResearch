homeautomation,fdw9zwg,t1_fdw2j8p,1578756603.0,"KNX actors (as they call them, these are in fact smart contactors or dimmers) are generally installed in a central electric enclosure. From there on you pull wires to each lamp, or each group of lamps. If you have 3 lamps you want to control separately you need 3 actors in the central cabinet and 3 pairs of wires going to the 3 lamps.

DALI is more like a bus. The DALI interface is build into each light fixture. You pull 1 set of wires (main + control) from the central cabinet to the first lamp and from there on you daisy chain to the next lamp fixture and so on. Advantage is you need far less wires, disadvantage is you'll need more expensive DALI compatible light fixtures or a separate DALI driver for each group of fixtures. In my opinion this makes sense only if you want a really big number of individually controllable lights.

Of course every time you want to make a change you will have to use ETS again so you want to own the ETS license yourself. Any ETS license will do as long as it supports the size of your project (=number of devices).

ETS Lite is exactly the same with a 20 device limit. You could use this one for a project with more that 20 devices but you'll have to cut your project in multiple pieces. Feasible but cumbersome. I did it ones to help someone, so I know it works but would certainly not advice it. The good thing is you can start with the lite version and upgrade later to the pro version without financial impact as the cost for the upgrade is the same as the difference in cost between the 2 versions:  [https://www2.knx.org/ie/software/ets/prices/index.php](https://www2.knx.org/ie/software/ets/prices/index.php)

With remote access (=from the outside internet to your house using an app or any other method) you have to go the VPN way. And this is valid for any system. Else it will never be secure.
Now that said it is the connection between the app and your home 'server' that has to be secure, this is not the KNX side of things (unless you'll directly connect to a KNX only server but I would not go that way and choose a more open software, it will also be cheaper and allow for a lot more custom things)"

KNX appliances are made by a lot of different very renowned brands. And that is a big advantages. Everything is compatible as the standard is very rigorously verified. There are a lot of wall-switch designs to choose from (very important for the WAF - Women Acceptance Factor). A lot of 'actors' to choose from too. Guaranteed you will find something that will suit your needs and in the eventuality that the chosen brand disappears you'll be able to find multiple alternatives.

KNX is rather expensive stuff, but in general top of the bill quality and it will last a very long time. I know some homes with an over 25 year old system still working as on day one, never failed a component. Also important is that it is still possible to expand and integrate those old systems with new KNX devices as the protocols are backwards compatible.

KNX is not limited to lighting. You'll find an appliance or device for about everything. Heating control; weather information; security stuff; pool control; blinds; EV-chargers; etc...  name it and it exists. There are also KNX-DALI modules out there. Both technologies are actually complementary.

KNX is widespread. You'll find it everywhere and that means a broad user-base and many options to choose from for about anything you want to do. Any self-respecting home automation software will have a 'driver' to interface with KNX.

Programming KNX is not difficult ones you got the hang of it but you need their proprietary software.

KNX does not need a central system/computer/server. In my opinion this is very important. Let me explain: KNX devices talk directly to each other without the need for a central control unit. This means that if the central control unit fails your house still got lights and switches and so on.... The important things will still work as before. A KNX system does not need a central unit but you can add one, now or later. In my case I have added one to control the more complicated stuff such as integration with the media system; CCTV and advanced timers. Example: Wife pushes a button (on a KNX switch) the lighting setup changes; Sony TV switches on Netflix; the Harman Kardon surround sound system switches to the correct settings; the RF doorbell gets muted; and temperature settings are on comfortable mode.

Security: Most KNX devices communicate over 2 wire using a rugged and rather old fashioned serial protocol. If you can physically plug into that cable it is indeed possible to control the KNX stuff within minutes. Nothing difficult, anyone able to implement KNX can do it. But is that at all interesting for an intruder? There are some mitigations possible. Not necessary for a normal home in my opinion. There are Ethernet to KNX bridges available (and you should buy one). Most of these are not secure (no password; nothing encrypted). So yes, you can indeed send commands to the KNX network if you know the IP address and how it works and start messing around with settings and so on. If you are afraid some terrorist starts playing with your lights the solution for this is very simple: keep it on a separate network or a separate VLAN on your normal network and protect it with a firewall.

Cabling: I personally do not use the green KNX certified cabling but standard Ethernet CAT6 cabling. In a star topology (as in a normal computer network) because I want maximum flexibility and it works very well with KNX. If you want to limit the length of the cable KNX allows to daisy chain."
