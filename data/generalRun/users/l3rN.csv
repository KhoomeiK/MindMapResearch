AskReddit,ff86n54,t1_ff83lyu,1579667483.0,I’m not sure what happened to him but I had to drop out of school a while ago. Situation similar sounding to yours. Managed to qualify for the fafsa cap and am back in school now. It’s a very easy process
YouShouldKnow,fezvfdw,t1_fezb9jj,1579462168.0,Nah the nsa will email you constructive criticism about whatever you’re writing before you’ve had a chance to share it with anyone
DiWHY,fehcteq,t1_fef4wfw,1579113913.0,I’ve never had the teeth fall out nightmare but ever since I had a tooth break last year I’ve started getting dreams where other teeth break. I fucking hate it.

todayilearned,fduey6b,t1_fdtbdce,1578732114.0,There’s YouTube++ and cercube on iPhone that are pretty similar to vanced. Requires jumping through a couple more hoops than android though
IAmA,fdqfa22,t1_fdqe0wl,1578665177.0,"Basically said that the dude was heavily exaggerating the danger, since he was never unrescueable, and that he wasn't giving credit to the people that made it possible, was on a 'road' they deliver fuel on and some other things, and saying he was basically being dishonest about a lot (not to take away from what he did) to feed his ego. The person who edited the comment pretty clearly was very familiar with the scene."

What he did is very impressive but it does seem like you’re right that he’s being dishonest about some of it
