AskReddit,fewa1ww,t3_eqpaau,1579407384.0,Sometimes I get these sneeze attacks. I can’t stop sneezing for 2-3 minutes but it feels so good! Right as it stops feeling good and begins to feel annoying they stop. It should be noted that I suspect they feel good because I sneeze with complete and utter disregard for anyone around me. With all my might. Maybe it’s the release?

Imagine an emergency breaking out and they’re trying to communicate with you to let you know to either evacuate the building or run for your life. You, however, are jamming out to Drake and don’t listen to the communication, and are now in serious danger. That’s why. They are not allowed. For your own good and safety."
