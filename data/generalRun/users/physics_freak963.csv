calculus,ffaree6,t3_esiibz,1579742727.0,"First lets reshape it [(2/n)×(1+(2i/n)]=2/n+4i/(n^2 ) now 2/n=0 cuz n->inf ergo your Serie is 4i/(n^2 ) technically you could take 4 outside the serie so it's 4×{n->inf segma (from i=1 to n) [i/(n^2 )]} let's call this K we know 0=<k, while i is never bigger than n so k<{n->inf segma (from i=1 to n) [n/(n^2 )]} which also equal to{ n->inf [n×n/(n^2 )]}={n->inf [(n^2 )/ (n^2 )]={n->inf [1]} which equal to 1 (we multipled by n because it is the Same value added to itself over and over again n time because there's no i) so like this I just came up with 0<=k<1 and your série is 4×k ergo it's bigger than 0 and smaller than 4, I'm sorry that all I got and I won't be surprised if I missed something up and this turned out to be wrong cuz it's really late (3:25am)sorry bud"

AskElectronics,fev881f,t1_feslg52,1579394367.0,"Dude u should have attended my ElecEng1 course (I'm a mechatronics engineering student) the professor had a gift to choose morons and he would draw a real simple circuit for DC and then add a really complicated loops which all connected to capacitor ever other lecture and ask for Req even when he was giving about maxwell currents and his matrix he would do so, every single person would just give the circuit a look of horror and start replacing nodes with triangles other would do the same but they redraw the whole thing as the generator nodes are two bridges and not even knowing what the hell they're doing, in general the whole first two semester was hilarious because of people like that"

AskPhysics,fetruul,t3_eqjqe1,1579379204.0,"It's subjective, some want to solve the gab between general relativity and quantum fields theory (this come with all colors and shapes like trying to explain gravity with quantum mechanics other uses the idea of hyperspace to explain so like even using hyperspace is quite vast there's the idea of projectories and dimensions tangled with each other are mostly a cocktail of above), the singularity of black holes, quantum fluctuation, the early universe, quantum entanglement, there is also the countless problems that turned in the stander model especially after the whole neutrino chaos, and there is still a debate on superposition and what happens in it which is literally the foundation stone of quantum mechanics weirdness (this topic is the foundation of ideas like the many worlds interpretation) I think the biggest are the 1st and the last but the others are quite interesting
Edit: I forgot about the universe's expansion (dark energy) and the missing link to explain the galactic system movement (the most popular opinion is dark matter) I'm sure this isn't any near completion but I don't think it would hurt to share"
