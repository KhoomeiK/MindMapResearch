space,fgiu5iy,t1_fgiq2nf,1580830975.0,"So I'm going mental for calling someone out for making shit up, vs the person who made shit up because of the headline? I wouldn't have responded at all if they didn't make shit up and try to pass it off as fact."
space,fgiu0ux,t1_fgiqc9p,1580830893.0,But that's what's being argued here. News accuracy and neutrality. It's not as punchy *because* it doesn't elicit the same emotional reaction from the reader. That's the whole point. People want the news to favor accuracy and neutrality.
space,fgipoux,t1_fgip0qc,1580828066.0,">That or the author was trying to avoid over saturation of the word spy. Russian spy satellite spies on American spy satellite spying on russian interests vs. Russian satellite stalks American spy satellite spying on russian interests.

>Could be that benign, but does bring up a good point that they should consider the implications of their word choice better, even if it becomes repetitive.

Did.. did you just make up a fictitious headline to help your point? 

The real headline could have used the word spy instead of stalk and been fine because they didn't use the word ""spy"" in it 4 times like you implied:

**A Russian satellite is probably stalking (spying) on a US spy satellite in orbit**"
funny,fgimz7j,t1_fgimd7z,1580826156.0,I didn't say you can't use the words. I called usage of the words cringey. Just like you didn't say dudes can't post here. You called dudes posting here thirsty.
funny,fgimalt,t1_fgil1gu,1580825654.0,Sorry
funny,fgim5sa,t1_fgikwv1,1580825553.0,So you calling people thirsty is not gatekeeping. Me calling you cringey *is* gatekeeping? Hmm.
todayilearned,fgim2tn,t1_fgibdpu,1580825492.0,"It's actually really simple. I know coffee is served hot. I would still place it on my lap if I had no other choice. The reason for this is because I have an inherent understanding of the temperature of the coffee due to my past experiences of putting said coffee on my tongue and in my mouth. While it is quite hot, it's not hot enough to fuse my mouth, tongue, and throat closed. I know that for normal coffee, even if I spilled it on my pants, it would hurt a lot but not cause severe or permanent damage.

The problem here is the coffee was hotter than any other coffee was or needed to be. 20 degrees hotter. At this temperature, the coffee was able to cause unprecedented damage which was not able to be anticipated by the user."
todayilearned,fgilfnt,t1_fgijrus,1580825006.0,">When people are being retarded they need to be called retarded. 

This assumes several things which are not objective fact:

1) It assumes that you have the right to make the determination of whether or not someone is retarded

2) It assumes retarded people need to be called retarded

These don't need to be true, and indeed, are not true.

If we dig a little deeper it becomes clear that you just resort to insulting people who have differing opinions from you, as opposed to addressing their arguments with your own.

If we could attempt to get back on track, can you refrain from insulting me in your reply and address the all unions are bad point with some of your own arguments?

Thanks"
