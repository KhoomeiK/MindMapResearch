away."" 
  
The distressed owner wailed, ""Are you sure? I mean, you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something."" 
  
The vet rolled his eyes, shrugged, turned and left the room returning a few moments later with beautiful black Labrador. As the bird's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the dead parrot from top to bottom. He then looked at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. 
   
The vet led the dog out but returned a few moments later with a cat. The cat jumped up and also sniffed delicately at the ex-bird. The cat sat back, meowed and ran out of the room. The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry; but like I said, your parrot is most definitely, 100% certifiably ...dead."" 
  
He then turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill which he handed to the woman. The parrot's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""£150!"" she cried. ""£150 just to tell me my bird is dead?!"" 
  
The vet shrugged. ""If you'd taken my word for it, the bill would only have been £20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, what did you expect?"""

You get the picture.

Later that day the young man was regaling this tale to his equally horny friend, who decided he must try this for himself. So the next day the other guy goes to the mushroom patch, strips off and buries himself with just his mushroomoid member on display. Soon enough a nun with a basket appears. This nun however is one of the largest, most butch women he'd ever spied. Could have been an Olympic shot-putter. In a gruff voice, she begins to sing...

WinStupidPrizes,ff0cu1r,t1_feyulp0,1579467648.0,"I’m not sure you can cite motor sports as a good place to justify your opinions from. I defy you to find me a professional motorsports driver who doesn’t wear a seatbelt (or restraint) whilst racing. Also if you drive like you are in a motor sport event on the road then you are nuts and a danger to yourself and the public. There are not the same sort or quantity of onstructions at most motorsport venues as on the roads.

Also I wonder why you make your occupants wear their seatbelts. Not only are they in the same vehicle as you but if you truest believe ‘it it’s your time...’ then that also should apply to them. Do you apply the same ‘logic’ to crossing the road, just walk across without looking because if it’s my time I’ll die anyway?

Seatbelts do save lives and reduce injury. In a study in the uk in 1974-1976 (and now seatbelts are more advanced than back then working with other systems on the car to further reduce morbidity and mortality) stated

“Of the belted occupants, 42% were uninjured compared with 28% of the unbelted occupants. There was a 45% reduction in severe or life threatening injuries, which were sustained by 107 of the 1,163 unbelted occupants and 25 of the 490 belted occupants. The authors calculated that there was a 95% certainty that the true reduction was between 65% and 13%. There was also a 44% reduction in injuries that were classed as ‘moderate’ with 261 sustained by the unbelted occupants and 62 by the belted ones. There was a 95% certainty that the true reduction lay between 58% and 42%. There was no significant difference in minor injuries between the two groups.”
