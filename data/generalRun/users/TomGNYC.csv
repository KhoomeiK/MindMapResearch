Hey it's great for others outside of the fan base to pump him up, but in the context of the quote, it shows the negativity in the base. Favre is right.  You don't need foreigners to tell you this kid is really good.  Anyone watching him should know immediately.  This kid is special. He pops. Just use your eyes."
sciencefiction,ff99l6a,t3_es9iak,1579707981.0,"I really love the Anakin arc in theory.  There are some great moments, and, at the height of his powers, maybe Lucas would have been able to make it hang together properly.  It's really hard to show a good person turn evil and make it feel organic and believable.  We also saw this fail with Dany in GOT.  You've got to really get the details and the pacing correct.  I love the overall idea of having Anakin's love for Padme and his willingnesss to do anything to save her leading him down a dark path where he eventually goes too far to turn back.  I could believe that if it were done right, but the creepy age difference in TPM throws everything off for a while. The buildup in AOTC with Ani murdering the Tusken Raiders is really good and believable and sets things up nicely, but the awful Ani/Padme chemistry and dialogue ruins it all. You just can't feel in your bones that this is a love to drive him to the dark side because they don't behave or talk like real people. Then he goes from being horribly conflicted to murdering the younglings in like 2 seconds. It's too fast. It's just not believable. If they had shown him maybe going to arrest jedis and things getting out of control and he was forced to kill them, or it happened by accident during the commotion, sure, but not, ""okay, time to murder some children.""  It's too bad. I really love the arc as an idea, just not the way they played it out."

Pressure of living up to previous success plus heightened expectations plus increased scrutiny plus more opportunities for other projects plus more power (and less power to the editors) is a formula for disaster.

politics,ff2cgkz,t1_ff0njov,1579500641.0,"I mean, I hope so too, but the fact is that most people do not pay close attention to politics.  They vote on instinct and identity more than anything else.  Look, the average height for a man in the United States is 5'9"" but we haven't had a President under 5'10"" since Harry Freaking Truman who took office in 1945. Before him, you'd have to go to the freaking 19th Century (William McKinley). We've all got a lot of stupid, subconscious instincts that make us do things like vote for tall, white men over and over and over again and justify it with the candidates' positions, but the positions are the rationalization (most of the time), not the reason."

NYKnicks,ff2b5y7,t1_ff2a60g,1579499347.0,"Possible reasons:

a. playing the vets to up their trade value and we'll see Iggy after the deadline

b. Knicks need some wins to start to create a winning culture. 

c. Playing all kids together can hurt all their development. Having vets in with the kids teaches them how to play properly on offense and defense. A crappy team with crappy spacing, crappy team defense and crappy ball movement doesn't aid development.

d. May benefit the kids more to earn their playing time, motivating them to have good training habits, and better focus.

e. Mills, Perry, and Miller are all fighting for their jobs and may place Ws over the development of the kids.

Could be any combination of these.  Obviously E is the scariest one. There are legitimate reasons to limit the kids minutes and roles depending on what coaches and management is seeing, but the fear is that management may be placing their own  ambition over the good of the organization.

Hopefully we get a good dose of Iggy after the trade deadline."

I'm all for Warren or Bernie but let's not lose our souls in the process. Some of the operators on the far left are just as bad as the Republicans it seems regarding twisting the truth.

You just never know with prospects. Look at Lias.  Guys get hurt, guys stall in development, some guys just don't have what it takes psychologically to make it in the NHL.  Even if they do, it might take years and years. Look how long it took ADA and Kreider.  If we don't get a huge haul, don't do it, I think. I think you can still deal him in a year or 2 even at $6M if the kids make it impossible to keep them out of NY the way Shesty did. I think Miller may take years to develop the same way ADA did."

By that definition, lying about an affair certainly was not remotely an ""impeachable offense"". By any reasonable definition, Clinton's impeachment was a joke.  That's why it never rose above 28%.

My comment was more to the point that we've seemingly never, in our entire history as a nation, that I can remember, anyway, had a size/speed/skill prospect anywhere near his level. It's more a comment on the dearth of this type of kid in our system.  It's crazy that we have completely lacked any big, fast, skilled guys before this. I bet part of it is due to poor coaching. As soon as a lot of these coaches see a big, fast kid, they plop him at forward and tell him to run and head the ball in the goal, but even so, it's strange. If you know of other kids I'm missing, let me know."

One bad field switching pass, one really nice combination play on the left wing.  Other than that, just pretty solid, smart play. He did a nice job a few times of using his body to create space.  The ball was generally pretty sticky for him. I thought it got a little bit bouncy on him a couple times but he mostly looked good. His combination of size, speed and skills for his age is unmatched, I think, by any previous US prospects. If his smarts, tactical sense, work rate, and health develop well, the sky's the limit. I'm trying to think of any other US prospect with a strong size, speed, skill combination and can't think of many: Jozy and Agudelo are the two that come to mind.  Jozy was a very good ball striker and a promising passer at that age, but his touch was very much a work in progress.  Juan was so promising at 18. He flashed a little bit of every skill but he never showed consistency, work rate, tactical sense, or finishing. Brek Shea pops into my head too, but he showed the same flaws as Juan and had worse touch than Jozy. Wow. it's crazy that I can't think of anyone even close to Gio as a US size/speed/skill prospect.  Anyone help me out?"
NYKnicks,fdfvknt,t3_el2ss7,1578371372.0,">Inside the Knicks organization they call Miller “The People’s Coach,” a nickname bestowed to him for his unchanging humility and low-key personality. Miller is exceedingly modest. His press conferences are hosannas to platitudes, as if his sole objective is to project to the world how uninteresting he can be.

Uninteresting and competent would be great."
