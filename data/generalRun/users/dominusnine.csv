Fuckin' A, this whole post is on point... I can't quote everything that I found dead on, but I agree with all of this on some level or another.

*Some* loyalty, the *right amount* of loyalty, is not just beneficial, but what can make or break your career, e.g. promotions and having your commitment recognized in general; however, loyalty requires a mutuality to be realized at all--never mind recognized--and for any benefit to come from it, it has to be adequately appreciated. That at least goes for the ""above and beyond"" kind of loyalty, not the default, expected amount of loyalty. Everyone has to be a ""grunt"" sometimes, but there's a difference between grunt-work and just being an outright martyr for (a) company that would be willing to throw you under the bus and basically treat you like cannon-fodder as soon as it suits them.

Personal relationships can be a beautiful thing in that two people can really be close, get to one another and even have faith in the other's potential that hasn't been reached yet; however, they can also be\[come\] no different than these type of business relationships--cold, practical, harsh, sometimes even destructive--if given the right (or wrong) circumstances. And even when it's not all that cold or harsh, you can devote every bit of yourself entirely to your spouse to still end up being thrown under the bus just the same. Many personal relationships lose their luster, that original passion that drove them, and become very pragmatic and business-like, and couples will end up staying together just to make ends meet. It's increasingly common these days. It hasn't happened to me, and I'm not trying to be overly pessimistic about it. It's just fact.

When many relationships and careers can seem so easy to lose, life can seem daunting, especially when we neglect the most important ""personal relationship"" of all. The *one*, *real*, *very* ""personal"" relationship you will always have, however, is the personal relationship with yourself and your own life. That's why it's of utmost importance to realize when your loyalty and potential are undervalued and to *always* keep your options open. Even if you have a great career, or what you *think* is a great career, it's never a bad idea to at least just keep a foot in the water. You never know what other career could be waiting for you around the corner. For example, my father, back when he was still around, was a retired Hollywood film producer who worked with some big names--*really* big names--well before he reached his peak. His path to Hollywood all started back when he was working as an underpaid, overworked accountant at some nothing firm. His boss was off on one of his many vacations when he received an offer to do the same thing, crunching numbers, but this time for Hollywood instead. Now, these days, it probably won't be Hollywood that calls on you, but it just goes to show: it happens; it's possible, and you will only get there by keeping our eyes peeled and remaining ready to devote your all, loyal to yourself first."

I stopped cutting when I was 17, and at 19, I began self-harming again in other ways for a brief period of time. I may have self-harmed again a little later in ways that I don't remember as well, but I've been away from it for about 9 years now. If you'd like to talk, I'm here. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts as well, all the way up to...well...right now, as we speak. I deal with it every day. I just have an oath to myself to not give in to any of the urges. Let me know if you want to talk...

I feel like I've been hearing more stories about male cutters than I ever have before. Back when I used to cut, I was one of the very few around. It's often the females who cut. That's where I learned about it and picked up the behavior myself. I was committed to the ward and saw some girls who gave themselves *gnarly* cuts and scars, some that were from methods other than cutting that I won't even name here. It made me sad to see that. Male or female, young or old, I feel that solidarity with cutters because I've been there. I still am. I just don't cut anymore. I still want to, often; I just know that it wouldn't help me with where I'm at now in life."

I believe that the classic old story of *Romeo and Juliet* has a great message, and that message is that: ""It is always good to wait,"" and that it is always good to ""Know for sure,"" for life is short, and time is fleeting.

Ralph Waldo Emerson has said some great things. I have a quote of his posted on my bedroom wall as we speak. It's there in an attempt to remind me every day of exactly what is quoted above, just summed up neatly within a single line pertaining to its focus:

*Don't be pushed by your problems; be led by your dreams!*"
DDlgAdvice,fdfx7zl,t1_fd0wnp2,1578372692.0,"*I used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone.*  
\--Robin Williams

*It's better to be alone than to be with someone who makes you feel as if you are alone.*  
\--Unknown

These are slightly unrelated quotes. I'm just tackling that loneliness part first.

The rest of this is kind of long, so if you choose not to read it, I'll sum up as best I can, within this paragraph, the main points: What you are both going through is not right. Regardless of dynamic, you should never be with someone who makes you feel this way. You deserve, just as much as the next, to have someone who makes you feel complete. I believe that love has to come from within for this to truly work at first, or else we might not perceive real love even when we do find it. It has more to do with codependency than it does anything else, and it has a lot to do with enjoying an amount of time alone, however long that time is. Nonetheless, a ""daddy"" should have ONE little, and one little only. If you find yourself being blamed by him for the current circumstances, you can be very sure that you are being manipulated. A relationship takes two. It's a two-way street, not a one way lonely alley. If you don't believe my words, here are some words from those more qualified than myself:

(I never used to read this kind of stuff until it was brought to my attention in just the right way. Don't let it sound patronizing. Never say to yourself, ""I need help."" Say to yourself, ""I can do better. I *want* to do better!"" *YOU* are the one in control of *you* and *your* situation. Always remember that...)

Now, from my own experience, I've been there, and I've been in situations where I truly was neglected, and I've been in situations in which I *perceived* a neglect that wasn't there at all. The latter caused me to react and even lash out in negative ways, but BOTH can be very damaging.

In my own life, I used to not only enjoy being alone, but I *thrived* in my independence and my time in solitude. I did great things for myself. I took care of myself, I did as I pleased, and I was my own best friend. Because of this, I even chose to remain single for a long time (five whole years), and I limited my time with the few friends I had as well. I was lonely; however, it didn't weigh upon me nearly as much as when those years by myself ended. I was happy back then. I even found myself, who I truly was, during those years.

The events that followed that five-year solitude were events that I would have expected to be incredibly happy about; however, that wasn't the case. The first person I dated was someone who took care of me very well and treated me right. I just didn't mesh with them, and I felt something missing. It was better than my next relationship, though, that I spent with someone that I was absolutely crazy about. You see, I still loved--and very much *needed*\--my alone time when this last relationship of mine started, and some unfortunate things happened that caused the relationship to go from a rather calm and relaxed place to a place of distrust and overbearing. I was very adamant about my alone time, no matter how much I was distrusted, yet, over time, my resolve was withered away by verbal accusations and attacks upon my character, and I gave up that very much needed alone time. A few years into the relationship, my need for alone time wasn't only disintegrated, but was replaced with a codependency, as that became all I was familiar with. It was all I had seen.

Ironically--and very hypocritically--the person who led our relationship on this contradictory crusade of their distrust vs. my eternal felt need to prove myself and my innocence to eyes and ears that would refuse to see or hear my truths or my pleas. I was condemned regardless. I was guilty until proven innocent.

Due to the damage caused upon my psyche by this last relationship of mine, I ended up making a lot of mistakes in my next relationship, the one I am in now. I am forever grateful that the person I am with is as understanding and forgiving as they are or else I would have been kicked to the curb long, long ago... I still have a long ways to recover, but I can tell you this... Don't let it go on for too long. The longer *you* put *yourself* in the hands of someone who doesn't appreciate you, the more you will feel as if that's your role--a martyr--and you will begin, subconsciously at first, to believe that you deserve it. The longer you remain, the more damaging the effects will be upon you, your heart and your mind. It will become impossible not to carry it into the next relationship, and you *don't* want to mess things up with that next person, because it might be someone who is very special and just downright amazing...

Again, and this isn't just opinion: a ""daddy"" is no different than a boyfriend or husband or any other type of S.O. in any dynamic. Don't let Daddy tell you that, ""because it's a 'daddy/little' dynamic, it shouldn't be any different from a family in the literal sense, where it's natural to care for more than one, as families often have multiple children/siblings."" That's *only* families in the literal, biological sense. DDLG is different. It's no different than a normal, committed relationship in terms of its basic rules--fidelity and mutual appreciation--and anyone who tells you otherwise doesn't understand the dynamic. If you decide upon polyamory, that's one thing, but nonetheless it is *still* each person's responsibility to maintain kindness, love, respect and civility.

A true DDLG dynamic is simply a ""daddy"" and ""little"" who have decided to add a second dynamic to their relationship--the dynamic of playing the role of someone's father and someone's daughter/son/lil steamboat or what have you--and to make a marriage of the two dynamics in a healthy, and mutually understood way. And it is important that you both *agree* upon this understanding.

In short, a true DDLG dynamic should only ever be applied to what is already a very healthy, mutually happy relationship. The dynamic is a deeper connection. It's created when both partners feel they want, even need that deeper and very special bond. A ""daddy"" is someone who should love you like a daughter and a girlfriend at the same time. They should be just as committed to you as you are to them, and a daddy should need his little girl just as much as his little girl needs him. They should dote on you as they would a girlfriend, and they should dote on you as you would expect a father to as well.

A ""daddy"" who neglects his ""little"" and then *blames* his ""little"" *for* this neglect, making her feel it's her fault or her misconception, isn't a true daddy at all. He's just a boy who is a user, or a player, who is *playing* upon the DDLG dynamic as well as *using* the susceptibility of his little's heart, her needs and her willingness to stay, to covertly manipulate and sneakily hide his sly actions. It's the typical guy. He might even seem soft; he doesn't have to be the alpha type. Guys do this, even the ones you wouldn't expect, and it's why I don't befriend many men these days.

I'm slightly biased. I'm a male, and I've simply seen a lot in my experiences with other male friends. I've also seen good, though. I've met very good men who do nothing but treat their partner wonderfully and lovingly. Biased or not, however, what I've said here is very true. Don't become a misandrist like me. Instead, inspire yourself to be okay with yourself with or without men like this in your life, and know that you can safely keep hope of a *great*, ever so loving and compassionate daddy come into your life and show you how it's really supposed to be done. You deserve it. You need to remember that as well--You *deserve* it..."
inspiration,fdfofug,t3_el1jkz,1578366399.0,"I like your post-it posts. These always stand out to me, and you choose some great quotes.

This is one of those *overly-obvious* facts of life that, in certain moments of feeling helpless and taxed with stress, can become a lot less obvious. You can think you're admitting it to yourself and taking full accountability until you read a very blunt and direct, to-the-point quote like this. Sometimes that's just what it takes. It wakes you up a bit.

Thanks for posting these little eye-opening post it notes so often. I always read them, and they always have something that is, at the very least, unique, if not very helpful as well."
