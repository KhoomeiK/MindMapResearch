Still, that's a sad tale I didn't know. Theo Huxtable was also apparently based on Ennis. Some of the plotlines even mirrored real life, such as Theo's dyslexia being a direct reference to Ennis, who was dyslexic. 

Upon discovering he had dyslexia, he underwent intensive academic training at a school for those with learning disabilities, and his gpa went from 2.3 to over 3.5. In his free time he tutored elementary and high school kids. He had his masters, but at the time of death was working towards his Doctorate in Special Education, and wanted to open a school of his own for children with learning disabilities. 

He was recalled as friendly and outgoing, he would greet people with ""Hello, friend."" The phrase is on a sign near his gravesite.

Sad thing to go through that, for anyone. If anybody deserved it, it'd probably be Bill Cosby, but I doubt if anything deserves that. He taketh away."

To say all of those guys are garbage though, it's a bold claim to say the least. 

The dependency, the mental illness, these aren't the things to be idolized or respected, rather, it's their ability to overcome these things, and turn them into greatness. They are not garbage - they are our greatest allies. Sole proof of prosperity in the face of adversity. But proof yet, that my failings are my own.
