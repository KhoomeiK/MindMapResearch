science,ffdo4do,t1_ffdf763,1579825018.0,Better access to mental healthcare would be phenomenal for our nation for so many reasons. Mental health is as large of an issue as any other form of health yet is so under represented in healthcare.
politics,ffb1tke,t1_ffakpf5,1579749669.0,"Lots of misinformation, a lot of people believe these things will end up costing a lot of taxpayer money. I believe several of these will end up increasing revenue and/or decreasing overall costs. I’m fiscally conservative so it took a bit of convincing for me to see the light. 

Working in healthcare really changed my view of ‘socialized’ healthcare. Pushing a diabetic into DKA because they can’t afford insulin isn’t fiscally sound, it’s better for society to pay for their albeit expensive insulin than for their stay in ICU. When we have a DKA who can’t afford their insulin, surprise, they can’t afford the ICU stay either. Yet the hospital still has to pay its staff for taking care of them, they still have to pay for his medicine during his stay, etc. These costs are passed onto other sick people with insurance or who can pay. 

This doesn’t even touch on the moral issue, which is by itself pretty tragic."

RenewableEnergy,fexv11u,t3_eqgncr,1579437003.0,"I’m very interested in this for my farm, with appropriate spacing it would greatly increase my grass production due to very poor and sandy soil with poor water retention. Sun isn’t my issue it’s water, panels would shade and conserve water. Currently I’m working on integrating trees in my pastures instead and only installing solar on my house for now."

pics,fekjhvm,t1_fekhbgt,1579201343.0,"Time together is the gift that matters, that kit Kat won’t last (wouldn’t last 10 minutes with me lol) and even if the gift was an iPad or a new phone etc, they won’t last nearly as long as the memories with loved ones, I still remember as a kid getting clothes from my grandma which (at the time) I thought sucked , but the time spent with her on what turned out to be our last Christmas together is forever a fond memory. 

On a side note I work in healthcare so this especially warms my heart because I rarely see family visit on holidays and actually still exchange gifts and give the patient some normalcy, this is beautiful."

worldnews,feail0s,t1_feag9rg,1578949231.0,"I totally agree, unless there’s evidence of an early flu season we should be shooting to vaccinate in fall, around here October seems like a good month but I’m sure it varies with climate."
worldnews,feacoy8,t3_eo9fum,1578947069.0,"Was there even any way in proving she had one of the strains of flu that are in this seasons vaccine? 

Regardless this is incredibly unfair to the parent(s), they clearly weren’t antivax they just believed the vaccine from 10 months ago would still be effective. This isn’t an absurd thing to believe given the information on vaccines is often very limited. (Example: make sure to get yours next year!) 

This family has gone through enough without this ridiculous inflammatory story. Don’t fall down the same rabbit hole antivaxxers do. Appealing strictly to emotion."

science,fdksnsw,t1_fdkqnk3,1578510329.0,"I would speculate that older people tend to commit suicide for other reasons, often the loss of a long time spouse, loved ones, and friends. 

I worked with suicidal patients a few years ago and the majority of older patients who attempted were men who had lost their wives or people who had other mental illness such as schizophrenia."
medicine,fdc7dy8,t3_ekl32v,1578268555.0,"What is the difference in this and standard monitors? Just that it is ‘wireless’? 

Interesting but I have a feeling this costs significantly more than standard monitors, while doing the same thing. I would like to see monitors used more outside of the ICU setting for this same reason however."

todayilearned,fd89xvk,t1_fd89juc,1578215674.0,"That’d be nice but that doesn’t often happen. Small restaurants try to keep food cost(ingredients) at 30%. Labor is often higher than that, and rent and utilities are often a large chunk as well. The restaurant I worked at would only profit during the busy season. Labor is what killed us"
todayilearned,fd87m9x,t1_fd83f9b,1578214836.0,"Yes they do, but restaurants rarely have such low labor and rent. 18% profit is still fantastic after all costs calculated"
todayilearned,fd87fa4,t1_fd83jk9,1578214769.0,"Still a good margin for food, yes the ingredients cost is high but labor and rent are quite low"
todayilearned,fd7r6s6,t3_ek9iav,1578208816.0,"Only? That’s pretty good profit margin

Edit: I should add, to think of 90 cents sounds small but think of it as around 18%, pretty good margin."
