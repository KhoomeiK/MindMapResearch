AdviceAnimals,ffxcyr1,t3_evmnbt,1580322604.0,I disagree. Seeing bands live is nothing noteworthy - loud and crowded at bes. Instead have adventures and maybe sneaking into VIP zone could be that cool adventure to remember.
Unexpected,ffxaw9t,t1_ffww6fl,1580321389.0,"Eh, I wanted to show off with my kitten feeding experience but you stole the show, you beautiful bastard."

It's difficult to help just like that unless she wants to stop it herself. She has to form a habit of not doing it and you can encourage her. Maybe some alternative like this guy is trying to draw (might not give enough shock value for proper replacement)."

So you can totally go through most of life without enemies as long as you don't perceive someone not liking you for that."

im14andthisisdeep,ffvu3aj,t1_ffuplld,1580273288.0,Responsibility is made up by ourselves so there may as well be none.
im14andthisisdeep,ffvu04p,t1_ffuvrhm,1580273216.0,"In that sense, yes, I fully agree."
im14andthisisdeep,ffun71j,t1_ffuahkq,1580245498.0,"Here's a bit more strict view:

Given that nature is chaotic AND that other species don't have comperhension on level of humans, then none species matter besides ours. Because if there were no humans, there would be nobody who would give value to other species. Other species can't give value to large, abstract things.

Not saying we can't be more sustainable - we should strive for it but never humans as species deserve criticism as whole, we are strongest species, we make the rules - as far as we are aware. I am with you that we should have sustainable rules. Other animals don't even have any idea what is sustainable rule or unsustainable - it is only in human heads."
im14andthisisdeep,ffum95i,t1_ffua6ot,1580244941.0,"Are you guys taking pills? Humanity is not a project by anyone unless there is someone like God or higher species that govern us. Humans can only have so much influence over each other - can't really make a project centuries long and have it not fall apart.

Can't really say if we will manage to expand beyond our environment in this lifetime but we will reach many amazing heights appropriate for our generations."

news,ffnucl8,t1_ffno307,1580070941.0,I didn't. May he rest in peace but don't forget he wasn't the only one to die in that crash. May all of them rest in peace.
todayilearned,ffn4s88,t1_fflqpkx,1580062082.0,"I disagree, I work more effectively with my team if we are in single open space. It's a matter of what kind of job, team etc you have."
EarthPorn,ffi06jr,t3_etousn,1579961018.0,Oh I miss ice like this. I remember in childhood we could go to local river parts where it would be frozen smoothly like this and even smoother. Was fun. These years it either doesn't freeze at all or freezes in chunks and ugly way. Still fun if it does freeze. Kind of miss winter activities.
