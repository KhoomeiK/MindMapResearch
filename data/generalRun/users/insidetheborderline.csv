As fucked up as my life is, I'm okay with it. I don't believe in an afterlife, so I think our physical existence is all we have. When that ceases to exist, we're done. I'm perfectly content with that. I'm okay with the hands I've been dealt. They're far less than stellar - I've got bipolar, OCD, a shitty childhood under my belt, all that other silly bullshit - but the good outweighs the bad. I have the most wonderful best friend who has been supportive through everything that's happened to me or that I've done. I love her too much, and I know she loves me. I couldn't just leave her - and I would never want to. It would devastate her to suddenly lose me, so how could I hurt someone I love so much? I couldn't. She's too much of a precious human being. All of my other closest friends are great as well, and I wouldn't want to abandon me. As a person who experiences extreme highs and extreme lows, I'm decently acclimated to the fact that life is a shit storm sometimes. I'm okay with that. It makes things interesting, I suppose. I'm stoned, and I'm rambling; however, I'm not happy with everything in my life, but I love the good things so much that I would never want to have been anyone else."
ToolBand,fdnxc92,t3_em5sep,1578594752.0,"Tool is my top choice for music to get high to and to play while high, and now I've gotten my friends into them that way. And now they don't mind when all I play is Tool, lol."
bipolar,fd02vm2,t1_fczdtx6,1578112830.0,"This may come off as ignorant, but I do not intend that. How can you have bipolar and schizophrenia? Doesn’t that combination just make up schizoaffective disorder?"
