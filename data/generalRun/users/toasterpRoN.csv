I think people associate her actions with rape simply because the crimes are sexual in nature...and those people don't bother to research further and would rather repeat the soundbite of ""She's a rapist"". 

I do however very much disliked the manner in which she admitted it to the public, as if it were something to rep, and not an apology for her past actions. It definitely decreases sympathy for her situation. But, to the point of our conversation, it is still incorrect to call it rape."

However, before you get angry at people for feeling the way the commenter above you does, please remember that some people of all genders have experienced sexual assault or sex-related trauma and may be more sensitive to it. Personally I have been sexually assaulted twice, once by a man and once by a woman (I am a straight man); both of which involved getting me intoxicated off various substances so that I was incoherrent. While I have moved on and put it behind me, some people have not and I know the feeling of watching the person responsible for it walking free....it does affect you.
