Sounds like you know what you’re doing now and it won’t happen again, all the best getting back down to your GW"

fatlogic,ffa6vaj,t1_ff9if5b,1579729032.0,"Absolutely. If an aircraft seats 156 passengers in economy, and if they were to increase the seating size by 50% (bringing the 3 seat rows down to 2) then their would only be 104 seats left. What was originally a $200 fare would increase to $300, and can you guess who would be the first to complain?"

One of my favourite things about losing the weight was to see the difference in airline chairs and how much room I have now. Does anyone else have this smug aura about them when they sit in their seat, and the person before them had the seatbelt extended super wide so you need to tighten it? 

No just me, ok"

Good luck"
fatlogic,feb9n5a,t3_enu47t,1578956642.0,"3 stone = 42 lbs

1lb fat loss = 3500 calorie deficit

42lb fat loss = 147,000 calorie deficit

147,000 calorie deficit in 30 days = 4,900 calorie deficit per day

If she was laying in bed all day, even if she is obese her BMR is like 2500 max (that’s with her eating 0 calories, let alone 300-500)

Yeeeah, I’m calling BS. The absolute maximum she could lose without exercise is 17lbs  with that kind of deficit"
