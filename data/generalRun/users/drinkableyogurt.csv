news,ffvlv0v,t1_ffv4r1x,1580267179.0,"I can see why you might think it’s purely sport, but I grew up lower middle class and hunting surprisingly supplemented a lot of food costs for our family. When I was 14 I shot an elk and it fed my family for over a year , and that’s after we gave some away to our needy relatives. Yes, there are people that let hunting become their whole personality, but for families like mine , it helped a lot, and not to mention it’s greener and healthier than eating beef for that amount of time. It also instills a respect in nature and a respect in where your food comes from, and what ornate takes to harvest an animal And all the work that goes into putting meat on the table. I don’t have to do that anymore but I would if I had to because it’s what humans have done for years to put food on the table. I also pay child support and I’m not sure how I feel about this law , I think if someone is actively making an effort to pay any back support owed, they should at least have an appeal."

todayilearned,ffvci7j,t1_ffv9300,1580260890.0,I stream and all that but I still like physical books and i don’t have a lot of money to be dropping 100s of dollars on the books I use for reference materials for fine scale modeling and other hobby projects.
todayilearned,ffvcc40,t1_ffut9s5,1580260775.0,For me it’s about having access to books because it’s isnt cheap to buy new releases. Plus I live in Portland and we have a nice library system and some beautiful buildings. Also never need to own a printer because I’m right next to a library lol
