Edit: we didn’t need to provide a note for any sick time unless it was greater than 3 consecutive days."

Already posted but just reposting as a warning. Many of these victims didn’t know they had been assaulted when they woke up."
HumansBeingBros,fdqj4mm,t1_fdqhzew,1578667936.0,Why isn’t this higher up? I just read this story yesterday - this guy was raping drunk men for well over a decade! Maybe the bouncer is OP’s post is a good guy..... but there’s always a chance he isn’t.
Miniworlds,fdpnpm9,t1_fdoh961,1578633933.0,Thank you!
Miniworlds,fdo7gvg,t1_fdnj9m4,1578600217.0,Will the mini flower world be available on Etsy soon? It would make a great gift!
MealPrepSunday,fdle752,t1_fdldhnb,1578522116.0,"Thank you! Last question - how long to re-heat in the microwave? And if not traveling, do you ever use the stove top to rewarm?"
MealPrepSunday,fdlcv5w,t1_fdk6cwm,1578521308.0,"This is awesome, thanks for posting! I want to make the oatmeal but maybe I read the wrong recipe so just to be clear - you decided to add the peanut butter on your own? You don’t have to adjust the recipe for the peanut butter? Sounds amazing and I’m hoping the whole family will start having this for breakfast some mornings. Have a great time at your conference!"

wholesomememes,fcyrwgr,t1_fcyft7s,1578085776.0,Very good advice for people to follow!!
wholesomememes,fcyrs0u,t1_fcyjhqo,1578085704.0,"Yes, it makes you much warmer. I had to put in a window unit AC for the summer months so that I could still use my blanket but not freeze out the others in the house."

oddlysatisfying,fcv6qvv,t1_fcsnuum,1577995799.0,Wow I love those labels. Can you tell me what circuit you bought? I’m on the hunt for a really great label maker. Thanks!
Breadit,fcrs158,t1_fcqyoz7,1577905845.0,Sounds like a great young man! Congrats and happy new year to both of you!
Breadit,fcrrty0,t1_fcrl52w,1577905765.0,I’m sorry you’re having a bad New Year’s Day. That’s still no reason to be ugly to this proud parent. I hope things get better and you can have a better appreciation for others.
whiteknighting,fcrnse5,t1_fcmbici,1577904238.0,I get the feeling that these aren’t grown men.
therewasanattempt,fcc2m4d,t1_fcc1dfn,1577593710.0,"Are you ok? I’m not getting into a pissing match with you, I have better things to do. Have a good night."
therewasanattempt,fcc11z5,t1_fcbyv2n,1577593209.0,Agreed. I was just responding to the statement saying that “if the hose water isn’t warm enough to use then it must be too cold out to swim”. That statement does not always hold up as true.
therewasanattempt,fcby3nn,t1_fcbxpmx,1577592259.0,Not the same where we live. You could let it run for an hour and it’s still going to be too cold to use in the pool. We are near the Canadian border and our well was put at 50 feet down.
therewasanattempt,fcbx0do,t1_fcbkwkm,1577591910.0,"Not sure where you are from but if you ever lived up north and have a well (40 or more so feet deep) you’d know that it can be 80 degrees outside and the hose is still going to have freezing water coming out. Now in Texas it would be 90 degrees and that water coming out of the hose could burn you, but up north it’s totally possible for it to be warm enough to swim but the ground water too cold to use. We run the house from the bathroom sink then through a window so the kids can have cool but not cold water in the summer."
