JRPG,ffarml9,t3_esk1v0,1579742875.0,"Grandia 2 has the best battle system of the trio. A solid story with memorable and endearing characters. Graphics are fine, but dated and cartoony. 
Its one of my top 5 jrpgs of all time, while the FF games wouldn't place in the top 20. So my take is definitely buy Grandia 2."
AskReddit,ferk00u,t3_eq9k9o,1579354865.0,"Tragically Hip in the early 2000s. No energy, and didn't give a crap what the audience responded to. Played one older rock classic, everybody cheered. Didn't play another for the rest of the night. So disappointing and only an hour with no encore despite people cheering for 20 minutes hoping for something better. 

Hate saying because the band is a Canadian legend and he passed away recently...but still the truth."
writing,fegzjy2,t1_fegz5if,1579106001.0,How can you learn to do something without engaging with it? People giving advice can only go so far. You need examples to help bring that advice to life. If you dont want to read whole novels at least read chapters as examples.

patientgamers,fduwm6c,t1_fdqb9qx,1578740086.0,"BOTW plays very differently from Skyrim or Witcher. The story is minimal. You'll hardly interact with NPCs. Theres very few quests to complete. Most of the game is exploring the world and occassionally fighting groups of enemies. Witcher 3 always felt lile there was a thousand things I could do because of the people I spoke to, but none of it grabbed my attention. A lot of quests I didn't care about kept appearing, but because I wasn't invested I didn't do much. 

I loved BOTW, but disliked Witcher 3, and for me it came down to control and gameplay. BOTW has incredible controls. Exploring always feels good, and I'm never fighting to make Link do what I want. Everything feels responsive. Gerald moves like a drunk boat. Just his turning drove me mad. It made me less interested in exploring the world. 

Honestly, I think these two games are unfairly compared. They both feature big open worlds, but their game design and execution are really different. Doom and Fortnite are both fps games, but they're nothing alike in how they play. Same thing."
writing,fdqes1o,t1_fdqc5fc,1578664789.0,"I'm the opposite. Too many made up words drives me up the wall. I read brioche and I know what it is. This let's me focus on elements of the story and world that actually matter. 

The problem with writing for any audience, there's no easy answer. Hope OP finds what will work for his story and readers."
NintendoSwitch,fdcq2ra,t3_eknvxj,1578281197.0,"Dragon Quest 11 is a love letter to the jrpg genre. It's a perfect combination of old school gameplay and modern mechanics. Story and characters are simple, but engaging. You'll come to love the crew of adventurers you assemble during your quest, and the NPCs you'll meet along the way. 

Tip - don't let the game control all your battles. The auto fighting is great to get some insight into how things work, but it doesn't always handle enemy attacks and weaknesses well after the first 3rd of the game. Getting used to manual fighting will make the experience much better overall."
TheSimpsons,fdc5xtv,t3_ekjtbl,1578267747.0,"If the golden age writers had all stayed on due to a passionate need to keep telling stories, we'd probably have a incredible but very different television show than what it was. Storytellers tend to change as they age, and need characters to change. If this was an extended passion project, I'm sure they'd have evolved the characters eventually. Maybe aged them over the decades. Looked for new and unique situation to place them. Added a ton of new characters to keep things going. 

If the writers were forced to stay due to contract obligation it would probably be far worse than  what we have now. 30 years of being made to create stories you dont care about anymore would less to a massive drop off in quality."

Falcom,fd6hgzl,t3_ek601w,1578191084.0,"Why bother trying to convince him? Why does his opinion matter in the least to your enjoyment of the game? 

You both clearly like JRPGs. Instead of focusing on convincing him, why not talk about what you love about the genre. Use your games as examples and engage him on his opinions. Dont mirror the extremist arguements you find online. They're not worth the effort and annoyance."
NintendoSwitch,fcym4de,t3_ejjyjs,1578082549.0,I doubt we'll get another Mario Kart anytime soon. The current release is a massive seller and continues to be so. With a price reduction it'll probably sell even better. I don't see the business incentive. They're better off milking it until a whole new switch 2 launches.

retrogaming,fcszsbu,t3_eipu4x,1577929208.0,"I bought a mini pc by gigabyte for around $300 canadian 5 years ago. Ran windows 10 off a core i3 laptop CPU with 8 gb of ram and a 250gb laptop Hdd. I loved it until I was gifted a gaming pc last year. 
Being a windows system meant it had relatively few limitations. I could customize it to my heart's content and accessories were easy to pick up. 
It ran everything up to Dreamcast without issue. Dreamcast was maxed at 640x480, but would run at a solid 60fps. Dolphin could run some games, but not many. Made for a solid emulation system."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,fcsz1v0,t3_eiqly7,1577928687.0,"I wouldn't put him in my top 5, but I definitely enjoyed Shulk as a protagonist. He's got a strong character arc and distinct personality. I like his interactions with the rest of the cast. 
I wonder what people really hate about him. Now I'm curious too."

ghostbusters,fckpi71,t3_ehp1kv,1577730391.0,"Trailers are often cut by a different team from those working on the actual film. Play this trailer and then watch the teaser for The Force Awakens. They're surprisingly similar. I would bet the people who made the GB trailer were told to aim for the Star Wars feeling and absolutely nailed the task they were given. 

Now, if I'm right about the trailer team mirroring Star Wars, it does explain the lack of humor. Comedy doesnt fit the tone the trailer is aiming for. Not saying whether that's good or bad, only what I suspect happened."
StarWars,fckfwo4,t1_fcketdu,1577724429.0,"100% agree there was no cohesion. Even with all the stuff I talked about, its clear these were films made by very different people who didn't work well together. 

The way they setup creators, these shouldn't have been a trilogy. The OT was a stand alone movie, then a pair of sequels planned as a two parter.  PT was a trilogy, one story planned from start to finish. Everybody dropped the ball here by not planning, or agreeing that it didn't need an overarching story. These could have been more stand alone films and probably would have worked better that way. Less stepping on toes and leaving loose ends."
writing,fckf8vi,t1_fck9ko2,1577724008.0,"Nobody knows if they're writing a history making novel, composing a song for the ages or making a landmark film. The audience decides these things, so get hour work out there. Dont stagnate in your own head."
StarWars,fck1f8y,t1_fck0x1v,1577713630.0,"Sorry, I didn't notice you're not the poster I originally replied to. That's where the ""you can skip TLJ"" part came from. 

I didn't see Snoke's importance as reduced in TLJ. He's clearly the leader of the first order and shown to be important. He then dies at Kylo Renn's hands, but that didn't diminish the character. We never learn Snoke's background, but he's not reduced in importance from the shadowy figure we got in the previous film. 

Same goes for Reys parentage. Huge aspect of TFA, and then TLJ makes it a big deal when she's told her parents are nobody. It's not a toss away line, it's a build up from the films themes about breaking away from the past. Rey hates the answer Kylo gives her. Daisy Ridley conveys the emotional turmoil it caused Rey. That's a big moment, even if the answer is small and crushing."
StarWars,fck024v,t1_fcjz59g,1577712276.0,"TLJ didn't throw away setup from TFA, it answered or dealt with a lot of what was setup. Some people didn't like the answers, but they were a continuation. 

""Who is Snoke?"" wasn't a question in the narrative of TFA. It was a question asked by the audience not the characters. In TLJ that audience question wasn't answered, but for the characters it didn't matter. Rey and Kylo closed his storyline through his death, which pushed Kylo forward as antongist. 

""Who is Rey?"" People assumed her parents were going to be connected to a big franchise player. TLJ answered the question by saying they were unimportant. It was a charatcer moment for Rey, having to deal with the tragedy of her childhood. 

""Why did Luke go into hiding?"" He felt like a failure and punished himself for it. Another answer to the setup in TFA. We spend most of the movie with Luke, learning about what happened to him. Like it or not, it is an answer to what was established. 

How did Maz get Luke's lightsaber? Neither subsequent film would answer this question. 

What would come of Finn deserting the First Order and overcoming their brainwashing? Neither film cared about this. 

TLJ didn't throw away setup, it built on it. How it built on that setup may not be what some people wanted, but it did expand from TFA. Saying TROS can be watched without TLJ shows it didn't build upon the previous film at all."
StarWars,fcjx55h,t1_fcjp6vl,1577708907.0,"The fact that you can skip TLJ and just watch TFA and TROS isn't a sign of TLJ being a bad film, it's a sign that JJ Abrams chose to stick to his story ideas rather than follow up the previous film maker.  Good or bad, Abrams could have continued the story and used setups from TLJ. He chose not to."

anime,fcgp3hj,t3_eh7xyo,1577642544.0,"I couldn't get into it. The main charatcer was too overpowered. The whole thing felt contrived. Maybe it gets better, but 4 episodes in and nothing hooked me. 

That said, my opinion is in the minority. A lot of people love the series. Give it a go. Worst outcome is you're like me and you stop watching after a few episodes. Not like streaming is expensive :-)"

unpopularopinion,fc75qfa,t3_egfa9m,1577498259.0,"Purposefully spoiling story twists for people is a jerk move. I've yet to see a good reason for somebody spoiling films on purpose. 
On the other hand, I dont care about spoilers myself. They don't matter because twists dont make or break a story. If they were the only reason to watch something, then repeat viewings wouldn't be a thing. Knowing a story point isn't always bad. I like going in blind, but knowing what happens means my attention goes to other story aspects. Which is OPs point."
fantasywriters,fc6tw7a,t3_egief0,1577489379.0,"My biggest fantasy pet peeve is names. Tolkien was smart and kept names simple and easy to follow at first. More complex names are introduced, but nothing too crazy and never too many at once. It's a slow drip. 

The Hobbits in general are a relatable group to begin the story with. They're naivety about the wider world also acts as an introduction to Middle Earth. They're the audience parallel. Something to consider with your own fantasy story."
