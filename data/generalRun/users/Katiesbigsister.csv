Frugal,fewcvm7,t1_fevww7n,1579408531.0,My 15 year old niece just called crying because she learned that lesson the hard way. My brother is out for the evening and her mom is out with friends also.

AskReddit,feontjs,t3_eptxb3,1579302684.0,"I started reading my Grams journals after we moved her to an Alzheimer's unit - I was sincerely interested in her decline, because I wasn't completely convinced that she was properly diagnosed.

She seemed to hate my aunt (her youngest daughter of two). She was disgusted my cousin is gay and blamed my aunt and uncle for some reason for his 'deviant lifestyle'. Even after she had practically become non verbal, she'd mutter my aunt's name as an obscenity when she was frustrated. My aunt has since told me my grandparents refused to pay for her to go to college but did pay for my mom to go to nursing school. My aunt was a singing beauty queen but she was definitely treated differently than my mom was.

I also learned my grandparents paid for all of us (four) kids extracurricular activities as it was their pleasure to do so but they never did anything for my aunt's kids. Additionally, when grams started buying CDs she only put them in our names not our cousins names. My aunt is really hurt by all of this. To this day I haven't told her about the journals or about grams speaking disparagingly of her."

AskReddit,fd44raw,t1_fd3ea6a,1578164440.0,"We have it in Lubbock, TX. It was amazing to me that every four houses shares a dumpster behind their homes. I love that I don't have to remember trash day and I can take it out at any time. The only thing that slightly sucks about it is that it is directly behind my house which means I am responsible for mowing around it. I also go out every couple of days and pick up spare bits of trash."

I was surprised to see they were welcome on a list of places that allow you to bring dogs, so I just happened on in there with her one night, but I did see the staff freeze up. Thankfully I knew one of the girls that worked there and she said because she knew my dog was social and housebroken, Etc she said I was welcome to bring her in. I have asked in other cities and have been waved in. To be fair, it wasn't a Super Target. There weren't any groceries."

Generally speaking, more than 3 million homeless animals are euthanized every year. This dog can easily be spayed in this time frame without issue."
