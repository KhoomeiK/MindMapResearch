You know its the repubs who want to outlaw marijuana use, abortion rights, etc?

>For example: hate speech.

Properly prosecuting hate speech that results in violence or crime is hardly banning. Personally I'm a lot more concerned over the term 'first amendment' becoming a synonym for hate speech.

>Another example: guns. 

Literally no one is trying to make guns illegal. Why do people like you hear reasonable terms like: ""universal background checks"" and translate that to ""derre cumming for me gunz!"""
