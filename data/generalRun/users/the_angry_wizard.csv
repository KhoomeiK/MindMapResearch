I managed to recover their work and told them to use Google drive in future- it was free with the university email and usbs get lost or die.

monkeyspaw,fcn8ee4,t3_ehvl7s,1577805931.0,"Granted but everyone else retains their memories from before a reload. The world experiences a collective deja Vu and they do not understand why. Sometimes you spend days or weeks reloading an event trying to achieve your desired outcome. The rest of the world slowly goes through ground hog day unsure when time will move forward without repeating. People become desperate and begin taking risks banking on the day to repeat and give them a do-over but sometimes you don't reload and they have to live with their decision. Depression and  anxiety increases. The stock market becomes more eratic with everyone trying to hedge their buy/sells with what they remember happening at the previous close of day. This results in complete distrust of the market and the wealthy stop trading and hoard resources until things pan out. A global recession occurs as a result, people lose jobs, suicide rates go up, families lose homes and each morning nobody is sure what events and decisions are canonical."
