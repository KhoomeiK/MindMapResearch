If your partner don't want to go with you you could go travel with  a friend, coworker or the neighbours. My ex had the view that, sex was just exercise that you needed from time to time. She didn't mind me having sex with other people, as long as there were no kissing involved because kissing = feelings. I was to branded by society to ever think about taking her up on the offer, but sex was not a problem for us either.

Back to your situation: Nonidea if it would work for you but I read an article written by a reporter who had done an experiment where she and her husband just committed to having sex daily for a year. There were many days where they diskt feel like it but they kept at it, even if it was just for a few minutes some days. Apparently their sexlife drastically improved.

A wax is allowed to harden so it will pull the hairs, which is something the asphalt can't do. Also if you do fall, the rate that you stop depends the asphalt and gravel manage to grab onto you, so even that the hairs are most likely super insignificant compared to your bodyweight, if they create less ""friction"" it would simply mean that it would take longer for you to stop and that you would roll glide further taking more damage. If anything since you don't feel pain in the hairs, they would in that case protect you (insignificantly) because all damage  they take does not have to be taken by the skin. Like the worst piece of protection gear ever. 

Sorry I'm not buying this. What I do buy is something close. If you fall and hurt yourself it is a lot easier to clean a wound when it has no hair in it.

AskReddit,fd5po19,t1_fd4ypje,1578180050.0,"This might sound harsh, and for that I'm sorry. I have mental health issues of my own and I many of my friends do as well. We are all very open about it and nonjudgmental in my circle of friends. 

I don't know enough about this situation from what you told here, but.. There are more factors at play here than what it feels you want to acknowledge. First it is the opening up part, secondly there is the fact that you had mental health issues and third it is how you did it.  


Opening up: I think most women really appreciate that you are ""in contact"" with your emotions, I really do. But in contact means a lot more than talking about your issues. Many men, or people, have the problem where they either suppress or deny their emotions. It is okay to be sad when you lost your job or something bad/sad happens, that does not mean that people prefer to date a person who is constantly sad/depressed. The normal rules of dating still applies, if they think they can do better they will move on.

  
Having the problems: It is not weird to have problems, and it should not be weird to talk about it with people. You break a leg, you don't keep it a secret right? But maybe it was a problem for her that you had problems. I started dating an amazing woman a few years back. She quickly told me her life situation and I tried to be there for her to help her through what she was going through. But after just a few weeks it became apparent that with my own mental health problems I would never be able to be the ""steady cliff in the storm"" she needed in a relationship, so I ended it. I really liked that she opened up so quickly and that she was so honest, but I was simply not able to be there for her in the way she needed.

How to do it: I like a girl that pays close attention to her economy, that doesn't mean it would be in her favor to tell me she is flat out broke or in debt on our first date.   
\----

As I said at the start; I dont know enough about your situation to say anything specific, but there is more to being at play than ""I told her my problems and she dumped me because i looked weak"""

In the show lost in space the character Will is a 14 yo boy who is also hella smart. Like PhD smart.
