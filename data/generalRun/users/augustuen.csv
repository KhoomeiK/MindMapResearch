todayilearned,fgmt4qv,t1_fgmlckz,1580931520.0,"There's a difference between intolerance and allergy. Intolerance isn't fatal, and is often limited to digestive issues, although may present with similar symptoms as allergies. People with an intolerance may also be able to ingest small quantities of whatever they're sensitive to, with small or no issues. In other cases symptoms can be counter-acted, like taking Lactaid when you've got a lactose intolerance. 

Allergies on the other hand trigger a response in your immune system which can affect other organs as well, and worst of all they can trigger anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is what you might associate with allergies like peanut allergies or wasp/bee allergies, with swelling of the face, tongue, or throat. 

Celiac is somewhat in the middle, as sufferers aren't at risk of anaphylaxis, but it's closer to an allergy than an intolerance because it triggers an immune response and affects other parts of the body, and [can even cause cancer.](https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-and-treatments/library/allergy-library/celiac-disease)"

YouShouldKnow,ff4ar0f,t1_ff484zf,1579559259.0,"Oh yeah, 1985 was a cover of SR-71's song of the same name. The cover is in my opinion a better song (and very arguably a better mass-market pop song, which is probably why was much more popular and is more well-known today), but the original has its qualities. It was not the first cover that did, nor the last. 


If BFS is your cup of tea, I'd recommend checking out SR-71 as well, they've got a lot of good stuff, even if they only lasted a (too) short while. Their lead singer is still working in the industry today, writing songs for huge artists."

Fairly consistent with what I've heard from friends with Leafs as well. One of them, with a fairly new Leaf, could do a 110km round trip twice without charging, while I drove my other friend's Leaf, which is a bit older, and it could only go one way before having to charge (11km left according to the car)"

If OP had ridden at a sensible speed he wouldn't have been anywhere near the car when it pulled out, and nothing would have happened!

Or if he had ridden at a sensible speed, the driver would've had more time to notice him, and possible have been able to judge his speed better, meaning he would've waited until OP had gone by."
