rollerderby,fenggfr,t3_eq1nnu,1579284156.0,No! And don’t let people try to force you to be a jammer if you want to be a blocker! Just know that sometimes how coaches tell you to do things might not work for your body type and you may have to play around to see what works for you. Like I’m a smol blocker and use my flank a lot to catch and control people rather than staying perfectly squared up.
rollerderby,fedv4id,t3_eomqq9,1579020545.0,"I  agree with /u/effervescenthoopla, you can definitely hurt yourself even with gear on. The only thing you should worry about is if you notice your gear doesn't fit right/slides when you fall."

rollerderby,fdng2gb,t1_fdkps7q,1578585046.0,[I used these](https://www.smithsafetygear.com/collections/wrist-guards/products/wrist-guard-black) Smith wrist guards for years but I would go through about two sets a year. So I would not recommend this style for durability. I love the front and back splints but  the stitching around them comes undone. I've had the plastic piece fall on the track a few times so I switched to the atom palm guards.
Jeopardy,fdmjiwa,t1_fdm2hqo,1578552208.0,He also said “it’s hard out there for a pimp”.

bulletjournal,fcuwkfm,t1_fcuphga,1577989985.0,It was pretty annoying haha. I just did it while watching TV over a couple days.
bulletjournal,fcujzc6,t3_eixnud,1577982735.0,Oh this is such a cool idea. Idk if this is accurate but the art nouveau style feels 20s but looks even cooler than art deco.
bulletjournal,fcuj0cc,t3_ej087a,1577982094.0,I filled it all in with a Muji .38 ballpoint pen. And the art was inspired by [this post by The Petite Planner](https://thepetiteplanner.com/align-your-goals-according-to-the-moon-phases/). And this is an Artist Loft journal from Michael's.
rollerderby,fchyuiz,t3_eh61ut,1577655731.0,"People are going to call you something 1-2 syllables for short. I would think of what word you would like to embody, then either go with that or use that as the base of your full derby name. This is your chance to create an alter ego of something cool or powerful you can grow into :)"
Rollerskating,fc7axng,t3_egfzo1,1577502204.0,[Steaks](https://steakswear.com/product/full-compression-crash-shorts/) are pricey but loved by derby skaters. And they sell specific [tailbone inserts](https://steakswear.com/product/extra-coccyx-pad/) too. Also remember you can get a concussion from landing on your butt so be careful if you feel weird next time you fall.

And [Noel Fielding's raven shirt](https://i.imgur.com/d3VLz8F.jpg) he wore on Great British Bakeoff. I found it and it was ridiculously expensive."
