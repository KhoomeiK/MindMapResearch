apple,ffdvc9j,t1_ffdtud8,1579829842.0,"You've misunderstood my issues. 

Device is setup, it has a passcode on it that I do not remember. It is not connected to my home network, as it was set up at mums on her network. It is blacklisted so a sim wont work for internet access. Locking myself out of the device after so many incorrect passcode attempts, will then lock the device? (iCloud lock), at that point would I be able to get to internet for putting the password in?"

apple,ffddzw2,t3_esucy1,1579818886.0,"I have an iphone 8 that is blacklisted in my country. I can't remember the passcode, tried the main ones i use but keep getting disabled, its upto 5 mins disabled. It is logged into my icloud account, however i dont know which one (both say this device is logged in) and im pretty sure i have changed a password since last using this device. It is not connected to the internet either as far as im aware. 

If i lock myself out and it asks for an icloud pasword, can I connect it to the wifi at that point? Putting a SIM in won't do anything as it is blacklisted. If I have changed a password, would it accept the old one or new one?

Im not keen to lock it out completely until I know what my options are."

samsung,ff5m3em,t3_eql5ra,1579599636.0,"If I was buying an iPhone, I'd get the highest storage option available, but samsung has expandable memory and much easier ways to export photos, so I'd go for probably a middle range if there was one. I currently have a 64gb s9+ with a 256gb sd in it, have filled up the phone but sd card is barely touched. Got it in may 2018, got the sd card boxing day 2018, have had the sd card pretty full but cleared it to my laptop. I am a major photo hoarder (100k+ on laptop), I have lots of apps, my music is spotify, and I often download netflix episodes if I can otherwise torrent them. As long as samsung keeps the expandable memory and it keeps getting higher, then I'm perfectly happy with not having the maximum internal option available. Apps dont always work the same once moved to an sd card, but having all my photos and videos etc to the sd card is a huge help for me."

Again a few months later, then again about 6 months later which I was 14 by that time. Not sure if it was age or me maturing or having someone, but the first 2 years of that was hell, then after that I enjoyed it and found it very helpful. Having the same person see you every week, no matter how things are going, really helped me. Bad weeks I'd see her upto 4 times, good weeks I still saw her for that hour and we just talked. I saw her weekly right up until I turned 18, it sucked having to leave her but it was very helpful to be heard and I really benefited from it. Don't know if it was related or not, but a few months later I hit rock bottom again but was able to get out of that reasonably okay with the help of some family that I trusted."

While in hospital they tried me on cyclizine and metoclopramide, but neither of those worked for me unfortunately.

I can go to either my doctor, the non emergency clinic, the emergency room, or maternity ward, just to get a top up on fluids if need be so having that option has eased my mind heaps!

The scopaderm patches, they are very expensive and aren't funded however it is possible to get a special authority meaning it's just the standard prescription fee of $5. At the same time, I'm not sure what anything is like overseas."
