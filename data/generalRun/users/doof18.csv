aww,fgjod56,t1_fgjo56e,1580848174.0,What?
loseit,fgiu3mx,t1_fghg9vg,1580830942.0,Yeah you should definitely go see your doctor. It sounds like you may have an underlying health issue that could be contributing to such a speedy weight gain. If that’s the case you’ll have more information that’ll help you with your weight loss
loseit,fgishza,t3_eyr213,1580829933.0,"Definitely start taking your measurements. It’s totally possible that your muscle development is keeping up with your fat loss. In my first month I was losing about 3-4 lbs a week and now it’s slowed down and my weight has been basically the same. But I take my measurements and despite my weight staying the same the inches on my waist keep going down.

The scale doesn’t tell the whole story so make sure to track your measurements too."
loseit,fgiqpc4,t3_eyp25u,1580828752.0,"I try not to beat myself up about the small stuff. Progress, especially weight loss, isn’t always linear. What I like to do when I know I’m going out is to try my best to plan for it. For example a few weeks ago my friends wanted to go out for wings and I didn’t want to say no because I haven’t seen them in a while. So I looked up their menu to find something that I could fit into my calorie budget so I wouldn’t have to feel about what I ate.

If it’s something I know will be a splurge, I like to make sure I’m very good for the rest of the week. And I approach it with the mindset that one bad day will not ruin my entire journey if I don’t let it. At most it’ll set you back a couple days which isn’t the end of the world. As long as you get right back to your plan you shouldn’t let days like this take get you down. Just think to yourself “one day won’t ruin everything”. 

As long as you’re remaining consistent for the majority of your weight loss journey, a cheat day here and there isn’t going to derail you"
WeightLossAdvice,fgioj4c,t3_eyjjp5,1580827272.0,"I was a binge eater too. The best piece of advice I got from someone on Reddit about this problem is to think of it as your past self. As in “I used to be a binge eater, but I don’t do that anymore”. 

It changes your mind set. When you continuously worry about the fact that you’re a binge eater and you’re worried you’re going to do it again, we have a way of proving ourselves right and falling back into that same pattern. 

When you shift your mindset, and think to yourself that this is something I used to do in the past, but I don’t do that anymore, it becomes easier to be that person who no longer binges.

This new mindset has helped me so much and I haven’t had a binging episode in a month (compared to my past self that binged almost every night). I really hope this helps you as much as it helped me!"
WeightLossAdvice,fgintef,t3_eypgu8,1580826764.0,It sounds like you don’t have a lot of time to workout so start off with your diet. Track your calories and eat in a calorie deficit. Lifesum is a great app for tracking calories. As long as you eat in a calorie deficit consistently you’ll lose weight. But if you want to build some muscle you’ll have to find some time to exercise
WeightLossAdvice,fginfqg,t3_eyq37k,1580826488.0,Portion your food. I recommend getting a food scale to eliminate the guess work. And track your calories. Lifesum is a great app for that. Drink water. A glass of water before and after you eat really helps you stay full. And sometimes just plain old discipline needs to take charge.
