gadgets,ffipseg,t3_ets977,1579979692.0,"I’m interested to hear some arguments for why Apple should switch. As far as I know:

- Apple invested in thunderbolt long before usb-c was ready for market. usb-c was adapted by so many others because it was cheaper (and inferior)
- Thunderbolt is 40gb/s as opposed to usb-c’s 10gb/s. 
- back in the day thunderbolt supported 10w of bus power, as opposed to usb-c’s 4,5w. More devices could be bus powered. 
- so it handles usb-c’s job, DisplayPort and PCIe...
- thunderbolt can daisychain 6 devices
- It supports more protocols than usb-c
- Retooling would be really expensive across their entire mobile lineup, mess up reverse-compatibility and effect far more than just what cable it uses. 
- and thunderbolt is fully compatible with usb-c, whereas usb-c isn’t compatible with thunderbolt. 

Of course they want proprietary ports, they differentiate the product and sell their own cables. Lots of companies do that to make money and encourage consumers to stay in the brand. I’m not saying that’s a good thing, but it’s a business thing. 

If thunderbolt is so much better, why would they want to switch?"

Bagels,fcuazp7,t1_fctyow2,1577976764.0,"I can help. Try this recipe. Once you read it through it’s not at all daunting. I’ve modified from this a bit, but 100% agree with the higher gluten count and the maple syrup! 


makes about 8 bagels. i almost always double this recipe. Takes about 3 hours start to finish the first time around. Worth it.

Ingredients:
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1.5 tablespoons sugar
1.25 cups (300ml) warm water (you may need a little more or less, depending on altitude and hardness of water)
3.5 cups (500g) bread flour (anything with 12-14% gluten (protein on the nutritional facts) is good. if you get whole wheat flour mix it 50/50 with regular white flour which is usually 11% gluten)
1.5 teaspoons salt

Toppings:
you’ll need an egg wash if you want your toppings to stick. 1 egg and 1 egg worth of water, mixed well with a fork.
i do poppy, sesame or a little salt. fresh diced garlic or onion is also amazing as a topping. put your toppings in bowls big enough to set a bagel into, so you can dip the bagel and get the most toppings on!

Prep:
put 0.5 cups (120ml) warm water in a small bowl. add the sugar and yeast. let it sit for 5 minutes, then stir it until it all dissolves. if the yeast doesn’t get foamy in the first 5 minutes, your yeast is dead and your bagels won’t work.
in a large bowl, mix flour and salt. make a well in the middle and pour in the yeast mixture, and about half the remaining 0.75 cups of water. 
mix it, adding the remaining water if you need to, until you have a moist and firm dough.
turn it out onto a floured counter top and knead it until it’s smooth and elastic, usually about 10 minutes. but it doesn’t hurt to go longer.
brush the big bowl with a little oil, then put your dough back in, turning it to coat it lightly in oil. cover with a clean kitchen cloth and set it somewhere warm to rise for 1 hour.
once it’s doubled, punch it down, cover again and let settle for 10 minutes.
preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C) or mark 7 if you use natural gas.
start a large pot of water boiling. now, to do it new york style, i actually put 2 tablespoons of maple syrup in the water. some people use malt syrup, brown sugar or regular sugar, some people do plain water. it’s your choice, but i prefer the caramel color i get from maple, malt syrup also works well but the flavor is wrong to me. it’s subtle, but if you try a few different ways, you’ll be able to tell the difference. just don’t use plain water. blegh.
divide the dough into 8 or so pieces (usually about 100g each if you use a scale). shape into a smooth round ball by rolling gently on the counter top. flour your finger and push through the center of the ball to make a whole. slowly work it around to expand the whole until it looks like a bagel. make the whole about the same width as the bagel sides, bigger than you think it should be, but it grows together when you boil them.
set them on a cookie sheet as you go, covered with a wet kitchen towel. 
time to boil those bagels. use a slotted spoon to lower them into the boiling water. don’t put more in at once than can float on the surface without squishing each other. 1 minute for soft, 1.5 minutes for new york, and 2 minutes for montreal style chewiness. turn them over and do another 1.5 minutes. take them out and set them back on the cookie sheet. 
once you’ve finished boiling them all, brush 1 with the egg wash and dip it into your topping of choice. repeat.
bake for 20 minutes and they should be golden brown. take them out and cool them on a wire rack. 
good fresh, even better toasted the next day!"
