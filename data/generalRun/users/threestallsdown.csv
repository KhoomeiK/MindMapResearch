videos,ffcxcqz,t1_ffcvyt2,1579809232.0,"Outreach and PR aren't part of their job? Also, how does this expenditure compare to other outreach projects (a thirty second commercial on TV for example or hiring someone part time to manage social media)? As someone who works with city government, let me tell you if a one time expenditure of 50k helps with a department's PR it's a fucking bargain.  
Listen, ACAB and all that. There are so many examples of police corruption but this ain't it. The article is just dumb. ""Police department buys a fleet vehicle that costs about as much as other fleet vehicles"" just isn't as sexy a title.  
Also, you don't need to guess what a crown vic costs. Ford doesn't make them anymore. I already told you what a charger, the most common police cruiser, costs. 32k. Which is pretty close to 37k.  
edit: Looked it up for shits and gigs. 2011 Crown Vic interceptor MSRP 27000, about 31k adjusted for inflation. https://www.autotrader.com/ford/crown-victoria"

Plus equipment and livery, adds up to 49k. I'm assuming a comparable cost for equipment and livery for a charger, unless you think Ford paints a pd logo on their cruisers and includes hand cuffs etc. The absolute cost difference appears minimal compared to other pd expenditures."
