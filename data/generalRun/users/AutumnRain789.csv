It was a life-saving procedure for the mother. Most sane pro-lifers are on board for that. If a pro-lifer willingly risks the mother’s life, he/she is not pro-life at all.

I have compassion for special needs children and their parents, but there still has to be some sort of socially acceptable behavior for the child’s own safety. A parent of an autistic child can’t let him/her run wild either. There is a balance. The parent won’t always be there to protect the child. He/she has to learn basic boundaries. 

In the past I used to think all screaming children were brats (that’s how my family treated all kids) and would give the kid a mean stare, then I learned about autism. I am sorry for being a judgmental person. Now, I look away to not embarrass the parent further.

Not everyone adapts to being a parent. My own father regretted having a family even though he thought that’s what he wanted. More like society pushed that belief on him. He was miserable and he made my gentle mother miserable too. It was subconscious at first, but we all knew it and it hurt. He gradually became mean and looked for ways to justify his cruelty. He never saw it was his own mind/attitude. He blamed us for not making him happy. Seeing that scared me. I did not want to be like him. You can’t control how you feel, but you can control your actions. I can’t be angry at him for not liking fatherhood, but I can be angry at him for 1.) Not bucking society pressure when it does not fit you, 2.) Punishing us for things which were not our fault (being born), 3.) Not seeing he was messed up and 4.) Not getting help.

Psychopaths and sociopaths are born, not raised. You can be the best parent and still get Charles Manson. 

Your child might be born unhealthy. Are you ready for a lifelong commitment? Not just 18 yrs. Seeing him/her suffer is a mental and physical drain. 

Your child might die before you. Losing a child is the worst pain a human being can experience. I saw this in person. My grandma lost both of her daughters. She literally lost her mind. 

Your child can be used against you and used to control you so make sure your sexual partner is an honorable man. If he is not, dump him. All sexual encounters can result in a baby no matter how careful you are. Pick the man CAREFULLY or just abstain. It is possible. 

I’m sorry my response is only Cons, but that is how I view life. I’ve grew up with abuse. Lost the only person who loved me, my mom, 10+ yrs ago, and I’ve never been in love (all the men I’ve met have been so selfish!) so all that has tainted babies forever. 


To handle “Who will take care of you when you are old?” fears, get long term care insurance while young so you can afford sitters/caregivers. I helped take of my mom and grandparents and saw many sitters/caregivers with the other sick/elderly patients even though the patient had grown children. Those grown children didn’t do much caregiving. The money still went to the same place - a sitter/caregiver service. 

Also, try to get healthy and stay healthy as long as possible. Start good habits young.
