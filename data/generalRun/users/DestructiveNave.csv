And having done so, your initial argument becomes a little pedantic. Plenty of people tip, even poor people. Don't diminish their contribution because some wealthier people with the means to pay a 100% tip only give 5-10%. That's the average tip. Having more money doesn't change that dynamic."

It's good to know Templar finally got to a point where it's worth using outside of Healer or PvP. I knew one guy that was a solid Templar tank, but he couldn't handle Vet Trials. None of the others I encountered could manage regular trials. 

I always liked the class, but it was just too lackluster. All about getting an enemy to 50% and spamming jesus beam. 

I took a similar route honestly, going with MagDK as my main. But in PvP, it was a monster. I could take down small teams, or stall small groups on my own. My Temp was better at staying at full health, but it just didn't have enough CC's, or ways to mitigate damage.

Edit1: I'd like to return some day, but I doubt it'll happen. The RNG end-game and garbage stability in Cyrodiil haven't improved, and those were the top of my complaints.

I'm not positive on this. If Bunker doesn't get a bonus for there being more players in the session, it's alone. All the other businesses do. I just can't say with certainty since I stopped selling stock from the bunker forever ago. I'm just researching these days. 10 things left to unlock!"

But this is a shitty way to look at it. I'd rather the wealthy and corporations stay the fuck out of politics. Stop fucking 90% of the country to make more money. I don't blame politicians entirely for where we are. The wealthy put us here through buying our politicians and tax breaks for themselves to be able to continue this trend year after year. 

We're being pick-pocketed, and we'd rather fight about race and placement on the tax bracket. Trump is bought. McConnell is bought. Barr is bought. Billionaires are in control, and that's where the fight needs to be. Take their blood money and reapply it to suffering institutions within the country. Stop allowing them to screw us any way they can. Money cannot exist in politics if we want to see positive change."

Trump is a huge threat to our freedom, and national security. Anyone else would have been charged and imprisoned years ago. But since we can't impeach him in the Senate, he's walking free. He know he has nothing to lose. So he's pulling a Bush Jr 2.0, starting a war in a middle eastern country over hearsay.

The only way we're running, is by party completion. This requires doing setups again each time. Theoretically, if you did 3 guys, you could fit 3 finales into one hour, but then it's a 3 man split each time, thus less overall. 

Maximum payout is two getting 85%. So as mentioned above, that leaves you completing the heist each time instead of force closing. Fastest we've run all the mandatory and important optionals was 45 minutes. That's a solid hour and 10 for setups and finale.
