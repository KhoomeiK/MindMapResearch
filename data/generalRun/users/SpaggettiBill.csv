Rabbits,ffjc5ls,t1_ffjadv1,1579995203.0,That's good to hear! Now thinking of it I was thinking that with a large human staying so close as well would help advery predators as well. Thank you for your response:)
Rabbits,ffj992f,t3_etw63a,1579993440.0,"I feel like a jerk for being negative but arent there concerns for predators? Especially with the bright blue vest, it would be so quick and easy for a hawk to ruin this."

Zookeeping,ff57v1c,t1_ff4yjsp,1579582802.0,"I think that is good advice, I will start moving emotions to work for good and be more progressive like that. I know our zoo has some Quite hefty donors and once you mentioned that aquarium being owned by a religious family that gets me thinking that maybe my zoo is also influenced by the donators views as well. 
Thank you for your reply, really helps to hear others experiences with similar situations."
Zookeeping,ff57lxp,t1_ff4dtau,1579582578.0,"Oh yes. I am in the U.S and in a conservative state at that, I'm very envious of the rest of the world and how they're are far less skeptics and more about scientific facts. It is comforting to here other people come have had similar frustrations though. Thank you for replying."

solotravel,fcuypgd,t3_ej1qh6,1577991171.0,"I have a friend who is doing 3 weeks starting in Canberra right now and they are getting evacuated, he was still able to do the snorkeling he planned on around there but will most likely be spending the rest of his trip in Melbourne (because he went with a group and that's their only option besides syndey) 

My boyfriend has said Brisbane actually doesn't have any or much fires at the moment (he lives there) 
So maybe you could start there? 
But who knows what the areas that are covered in fires and the areas that arent, right now, will be like in the months to come. 

I've heard western australia doesnt have many (I'd think because they don't have as many forests as east coast)

If I were you I think I would go anyways? When I did my Whv there weren't any fires to this extent so I don't have first hand experience with traveling in conditions like these.

Let us know what you end up deciding."
