I didn't say that at all, and comparing something I didn't even say to calling all Muslims terrorists is absolutely ridiculous of you. I said popular feminism. The fact that OP feels the way she does is proof that her circles of influence are pro women feminism, not pro equality. 

>The better question here is why you seem to see the ""anti men"" feminists and not the ""this hurts everyone"" feminists. 

They seem to be the ones primarily casting up and downvotes on reddit, or else a post like this wouldn't be upvoted on TwoX. I see both, but posts like the OP still get upvoted here often which to me suggests that many other women feel this ethical dilemma. 

>When I was young, I was radical in my atheism. It's easy to see that a young woman might be radical in her feminism. (Side note, men can be feminists. I'm a feminist. People should be treated equally, and systemic injustice hurts us all. This is obvious and should not be controversial to say.)
