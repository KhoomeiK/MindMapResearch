sex,ff9lch1,t3_esdjl5,1579715421.0,"So sorry you had to deal with that. I can relate to the way you feel. After my child was born and having relationship issues, I had no libido. Literally felt as though I could live the rest of my existence without touch or intimacy and be totally fine with it. And I did for a while. It was a combination of a bad relationship, hormones from having a child, PPD which shifted to regular depression, life stressors, and just general disappointment in life. I left my relationship, got some good therapy, worked on my self esteem, and started dating again. I am now married and have never felt happier or healthier! I know therapy is recommended for everything on Reddit but it was and still is a game changer for me. And it works! I wish you and your little one so well."
OCD,fesrhhh,t3_eq7wpj,1579368245.0,Therapists who are not specifically trained in ERP should never attempt to treat OCD. I’m sorry this happened to you. I mean Netflix is great and all but come on. I wish you well
offmychest,fen5q3j,t3_epxeri,1579277560.0,You are awesome.
socialwork,fejuk5i,t3_epd5if,1579186182.0,I am so sorry you are dealing with this. I had a client pass away from suicide and they did an audit into the file to make sure the agency (or I) had done everything.   appropriately. They allowed me to take the day off and found no wrongdoing or liability. I am sure they will find the same with you. My heart goes out to you. Let me know if you want to talk privately. Best wishes.

socialwork,feeqlny,t3_eorp3f,1579039124.0,"I could never work in CPS now that I am a parent. I can totally relate to what you are saying! Maybe take a break for a while. SW will always be waiting for your return, should you want it! Best wishes"
socialwork,fds62km,t3_emxaqd,1578695177.0,"I have shared with clients details about my life if I thought it would benefit them. You can always try to start the conversation with what your instructor suggested and then follow it with appropriate self disclosure. When clients have asked me my age, marital status, whether I have children etc, I have often told them that if we can discuss why this is important to them, then I will answer their question. Best wishes!"
Parenting,fdh6eir,t3_elanht,1578416367.0,"As others have said, therapy could be greatly beneficial. Go to someone who specializes in children and family therapy. It will help you to communicate better with her and have a better understanding of what her needs are. It will also give her insight into understanding her own emotions and needs. Best wishes!"
self,fcl429o,t3_ehjs0d,1577739354.0,Congratulations!!! We do recover.
OCD,fc09sol,t3_effzfl,1577284287.0,Fucking Christmas indeed. I hope you made it through and are feeling better now. You are not alone in this. Wishing you well.
