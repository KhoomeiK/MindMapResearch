The first person to say she would take it said she'd be right over and would it fit in her car. 

I said no, she'll need a truck and probably several strong people. 

The then asked if a station wagon would work. 

I said no she needs a truck. 

She then asked how hard it was to tune.

 I then convinced her she needed an electric keyboard instead.


They were all like this. I gave up and figured it was easier just to keep the damn thing than dealing with this nonsense."

Also I agree that what you are feeding isn't balanced. They need organs (heat, liver spleen, etc), offal (tripe), and omegas (I see you give sardines, good job). Dr Judy Morgan has some good recipes and a couple books.

I'd really suggest a premade raw (answers or all provide) for a few months to get him settled and get you confident in what you are feeding him."

There was this lady on one of my Facebook groups asking what to do with her 1 year old Cav who was digging, and barking, and destroying furniture and pooping in the house . She was told, in no uncertain terms, that the dog clearly needed more exercise and training etc etc.

She countered that she gives it lots of exercise and the dog is doing these things deliberately, and she couldn't possibly get her out for a half hour walk in the winter because of the owners own arthritis. I really had to restrain myself and walk away."

Given their reaction I would just up and move now if you can. Get out quickly, don't drag it out. They'll get over it but you are going to have to be firm in your boundaries. Do not give an inch.

I'd wait a few months and see if they take to it before jumping in full hog with making your own."

Dogtraining,fdls466,t1_fdkw052,1578531182.0,My girl loves walking on the dark it's a whole new world! Plus lots of smells from other evening dog walkers. I have a neon jacket she wears with a reflective harness and LED so she is visible and I also wear a reflective safety harness and carry a flashlight. I layer up if I have to. It gets dark here as early as 430pm in the winter and goes as late as 8ish. It's 12 F here today. Have been out for big walks when windy and lower.

rawpetfood,fdkqpd3,t3_elvqzy,1578509163.0,I would check out some raw food resources and make sure you are supplementing and rotating proteins accordingly so it is balanced. You can't just feed whole chickens and call it a day. I have seen raw fed and nerdy recommended I believe it's a Facebook group.

I'd suggest ""The bottle of Mr clean is under the sink, and the bucket and sponge are beside it. Use hot water when you are ready to clean up the pee you left on the floor"". Insert cleaning product and method as necessary. Don't argue or defend. Just state it and let him figure it out."
PEI,fdk7i79,t1_fdk0rvv,1578497845.0,"I do the same. I try one that sounds good, then I wait to hear other things reviews and pick one or two that people generally rave about. Even better if I can split one with someone."
bestof,fdh3jp1,t1_fdh1jfj,1578414612.0,"It's incredibly draining being the one to do all the planning.

Here's a good example. The  ""do you want to do something?"" question. It drives me nuts. Think about what goes into planning an activity for you and your partner. Say you'd like to go skating. Ok so what day will you go, do you have anything else on that day that might conflict with your plans, where will you go? How do you get there? Is there a charge? Do you need a helmet, what's the weather how cold will it be, do the skates need sharpened? Does your partner know how to skate? Is that something they even want to do? What if they say no, what's the backup plan?

Now perhaps the person not doing the planning is always up for anything, but never wants to plan because they'll go along with whatever. It can't be a big deal to plan right? And it's not, until you are the only one doing the planning all the time."

Dogtraining,fd4bcdo,t3_ek0ert,1578166051.0,"For one, he sounds like a bored dog. He needs more exercise both mental and physical.

For the second issue you need to practice teaching him that being calm = attention. This will be hard and probably frustrating. Be patient and outwait and ignore his ass until he can be calm. Then the reward is your attention. You ignore, ignore, ignore, until he's calm. Then calmly tell him he's a good boy. If he gets excited, back to ignoring.

Do you have a crate? Google some dog agility crate games, they're great for teaching patience and calm. I've seen a world of difference with my girl and they are pretty basic."
violinist,fd48x74,t3_ejxdh5,1578165413.0,"I highly doubt a reputable violin shop is gouging you. An auction instrument is undoubtedly going to need to be brought into a luthier for a new setup, strings etc. That has been done with these instruments and if there's anything you'd like changed or adjusted they can do that too. Don't focus on the price. Focus on the playability and sound. Do you like these ones or are you iffy? If you are unsure then try others. You'll know the right one when you find it."

rawpetfood,fd46ukt,t1_fd2jhi1,1578164932.0,"I think your fears are sound. I joined a few holistic groups on Facebook when I got my Cav and man alive they're the judgyiest, preachiest people...
