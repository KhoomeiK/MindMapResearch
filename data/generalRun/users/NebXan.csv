Divorce this discussion from the question of whether or not political parties and primaries are fair and democratic. I know they're not. Everyone fucking knows they're not.

The delegates are typically not ""party insiders"", just regular people who applied to be a delegate.

And yes, the party does get it's own ""superdelegates"" who can vote however ~~they want~~ the party wants, but these are only 16%, I believe, of the total voting body.

Refusing to testify or provide documents - just, show me any evidence of him testifying in court even *once*.

Things he “promised”

•	⁠Wall? Nope.

•	⁠Defeat ISIS? Nope?

•	⁠Replace Obamacare? Nope.

•	⁠Beat China in a trade war? Nope.

•	⁠Bring manufacturing back to America? Nope.

•	⁠Tax cuts for the middle class? Nope.

•	⁠Drain the Swamp? Nope.

He’s let the russians and turks take control of Syria, alienating kurd allies, let Iran take over Iraq, alienating iraqi allies. And he’s supporting the Saudi's who actually sheltered the 9-11 hijackers. In all his years he’s reduced US influence in the entire region to a rubble. While his natural opponents are having a field day. He couldnt just find the wargraves of US soldiers who fought for the last 20 years and piss on them directly?"

No, like I said, they do it because it saves them money. It's much easier and cheaper to just fire the guy who objects to your unethical new time management system than it would be to scrap that system and do things ethically. So that's what they did.

And because the penalty is so low, they'll almost certainly do it again if faced with a similar choice."
