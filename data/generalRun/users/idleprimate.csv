offmychest,fca85yi,t1_fc94vjv,1577564518.0,It's reassuring to hear someone spent a decade because I have and you don't hear that often.  I just feel like it means I'm broken because I won't date or partner up. But I still am attracted to and attract the wrong people. A decade hasn't cured me.
offmychest,fca7kco,t1_fc8v5w2,1577564244.0,"Where does this weird myth come from?  People don't do relationships well when they don't love themselves, but humans are programmed to love. They love plants--they do, they love pets, they love family and friends. Loving isn't hard. It's not even avoidable unless you're a hermit. It's caring highly for yourself that is hard."
offmychest,fca6qub,t1_fc8jpdx,1577563881.0,"Don't know about the poster. I was 15 and she was 18. Very abusive. At 16, I dated a serial cheater, an alcoholic cheater, a narcissist then a borderline. They were all older than me. I think they preyed on my naivety."
offmychest,fca5nwj,t1_fc8qt6f,1577563420.0,I hear you.
offmychest,fca5ibd,t1_fc8pcmi,1577563352.0,"This is actually a myth. People can love others under any circumstances. We're built for it needily. They just can't feel full and sated without loving themselves.

I don't love me, and I love lots of people. Family, friends, even a disabled neighbour I help out.  All that love is real but doesn't help me love me. 

I stay out of romantic relationships because I don't love me and it makes me choose poorly when I do. But I am completely capable of loving."
offmychest,fc9zyxv,t3_egonvr,1577560745.0,"Oh, crap.  Selfish comment.

I hope yours is the one. I still like seeing others happy and it's not common."
offmychest,fc9zpe3,t3_egonvr,1577560631.0,"I've worked for twelve years to try and be different and choose different but every girl I either went on a date with or crossed paths with had all the same redflags, but even louder.  I can't take the pain, confusion and loss of another bad relationship so I don't but it's very lonely. With the exception of a couple failed starts I have been single and celibate since 2008. That's insane if you ask me. Makes me sullen and resentful too.  I even pass up what look like safe flings because in my past I become the guy the fling wants--for two or three hard years and then abandons.

I'm just venting."
scifi,fb5xzh8,t1_fatqbg8,1576536642.0,"Well, that's a nonsense comparison. One was a sitcom which only needed to be about the characters in amusing scenarios, and audiences felt it delivered on that. The Mandalorian is supposed to be a SciFi drama.  It's characters need emotional depth.  Stories need to be more rich, they can't be just set ups for a punchline but they are thinner than Seinfeld storylines. He'll, this show only has two characters to even work with, one is a mute puppet, one a untalkative bucket head. This is a recipe for disaster, especially if the stories and side characters don't pick up the slack.

But the two shows are not comparable. And only one of them really divided audiences."
