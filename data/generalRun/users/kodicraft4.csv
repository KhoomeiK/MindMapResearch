memes,fgqglma,t1_fgq259r,1581023788.0,"I think that this is the famous ""Wolf kid"" scenario where a serious disorder is banalised by attention-grabbers/incompetent people at the disadvantage of the actual victims of the disorder. Honestly, faking depression is like anti-vax: Destroys disease protection.

I know what you feel and I feel the same way about many different things and that's bad. Because I can't talk about depression or suicide without saying that I went through this and feeling bad because of that. Because I feel like an attention-grabber.

You can find out if you are subconsciously faking it or exaggerating it by logging honestly your thoughts. Most likely you'll discover a pattern that will show you the way and very likely will discover the truth."
