actuallesbians,ffa1uto,t3_esfdx4,1579726201.0,"That's super awesome! Reminds me about that episode of QI when Sandi Toksvig shared her anecdote:
Sandi was once walking down the street with her two daughters and her son for no reason went ""Hah!"" like some kind of ninja. They had no idea why. When Sandi's son was six he had a friend over who asked him what it was like having two mothers (Sandi is a lesbian). Her son said, ""It's marvellous. If one of them is poorly, you've still got one to do for you."""
