Giving to charities in many cases isn't enough and isn't nearly as charitable as you think. Look up how the Gates foundation had enough money to subvert the voters in Washington state, lobby to change laws in order to get their way.

FragileWhiteRedditor,fezd0az,t1_fex6klf,1579456049.0,"It's not always hateful racists, sometimes it's just stupid privileged white people who had to find out in their late 20s or 30s that any use of the word nigger or nigga can completely cut someone to their core no matter how you thought you were using it. They have to actually feel ashamed and see the pain it causes to get them to stop using it. Much of the problems have to deal with white people living in white bubbles. If you live, work and are raised by just white people you're getting a really shitty one sided view of the world. I'm not sure why I never felt beholden to white people and the apparent camaraderie that racism gives them in my area but I'm surrounded by it where I live. Fighting with people and calling them racist doesn't really help much either. I told friends they were out of my life that I couldn't and wouldn't take a chance of putting someone I care about in a position to hear that shit ever again. It's one thing for random racists to let their hate out but when it's people you choose to associate with using racist language it's all my fault. Luckily all my friends were ashamed of themselves and choose to do better but I still worry about their circles of friends and family members.
