AnimalsBeingJerks,fgjwuit,t1_fgju3he,1580852945.0,I almost did cry at first... But it was hilarious! I didn't even mind cleaning up. Even when I had to get the Fat Boy (my cat who was acting really proud of what he had done) out of the way because he wouldn't move off 'his' pile of tp. I still laugh. Great memory!
HumansBeingBros,fgiz796,t3_eyj8uf,1580833938.0,I would make or buy him a 'metal of honor'.
AnimalsBeingJerks,fgixxe8,t3_eypcnv,1580833233.0,A few years ago my boyfriend at the time and I went shopping and bought a 24 pack of tp. It was a beautiful day so we just put it on the floor outside the bathroom and went for a motorcycle ride. (We had 3 cats at the time) when we got back the entire house was white. I think we managed to salvage maybe 3 rolls. We stood there in shock for a second but then completely cracked up. The best part was the look of satisfaction on one of the cat's faces as he lay right in the middle of it.
kratom,fgeetp0,t1_fgedwt2,1580697918.0,I only take about a half teaspoon at a time. I'm not sure how many grams that is. Only 3 times a day.
kratom,fge8286,t1_fge7c9h,1580693481.0,"Because plain lemon juice is rough... I take it with a good amount of water, then afterwards a tbsp (or so) of the lemon juice for the citric acid. I notice a difference. Drink lots of water. :)"
AskReddit,fgd3c1m,t3_exomzy,1580678552.0,"Keep busy cleaning up the store. Dust, straighten out things, etc.... That's what worked for me. I was the best employee. It used to piss me off when people just stood around. You are being paid to be there. Make it worthwhile. :)"
kratom,fgd2hna,t1_fgd1rie,1580678358.0,You are so right. Ty! :)
kratom,fgd1yp9,t3_exqcss,1580678287.0,I would rather have other opinions on the subject I'm wondering about rather than just jumping to conclusions. It's always good to look into things and other people's input.

kratom,fgczgix,t3_exqcss,1580677589.0,Ty for the response. I took it after 15 minutes after eating (I never eat a lot in one sitting. Small meals all day is best. :) ) and I noticed it. Now I just found out that I don't have to work tonight. I don't know what to do with myself now.... Lol
kratom,fgcti60,t3_exqcss,1580676091.0,1 tbsp of turmeric and a tsp of pepper. Mix with warm water a little while before you dose and you're good. :)
kratom,fgcsv7g,t1_fgcr5m8,1580675945.0,Or maybe it's a tbsp? Hold on....
natureismetal,fgcscdw,t3_expnbh,1580675855.0,That sounds like human behavior. Lol
kratom,fgcs17z,t1_fgcrmxq,1580675768.0,I find that the effects diminish after I eat. Imo it's better to eat before.
kratom,fgcr5m8,t1_fgcplxm,1580675492.0,1tsp. Of each I think.
kratom,fgcofsr,t1_fgcn4tj,1580674731.0,"Seriously, before I went out on New Year's I took my dose (no more than usual) in addition to the turmeric and pepper and it was great! I didn't even have to redose after many hours of being out. I like both black pepper and turmeric so it wasn't bad. Use warm water so it's like a tea. :)"
kratom,fgckbg4,t1_fgcibgt,1580673425.0,Pickles are a great idea!!! They are my favorite. A little while ago I used to mix turmeric (another great potentiator) and black pepper in warm water and down it right after dosing. I have a really strong stomach. Lol it actually wasn't that bad... I will have to look into cherry juice. Do you use the cherry juice when you toss and wash? I've found that oj hides the flavor of the kratom well.
kratom,fgcg1lh,t1_fgbh1w6,1580672335.0,"I must be really sensitive. I don't take that much to begin with, but it worked for me after about 10 to 15 minutes after eating. Pretty pleased, because I needed to get my butt moving for the day. Lol"
kratom,fgc8ssd,t1_fgc7wsb,1580670263.0,"Orange definitely. Citric acid potentiates kratom. I took it with a good squirt of lemon juice. I had nothing else, don't judge. Lol"
kratom,fgc7bxh,t1_fgb8gzf,1580669879.0,"I agree with you, but there were a few days that I didn't eat anything because I was afraid it would affect the kratom and I felt like crap all day. Diabetes and hypoglycemia run in my family so that wasn't too smart. Live and learn... :)"
kratom,fgc1rvw,t1_fgc0m7q,1580668235.0,"Yeah, I didn't exactly wait that long... I'm still feeling it, but not like on an empty stomach. I agree that kratom helps digestion. Probably because it's a stimulant. It's in the same category as coffee."
kratom,fgbisua,t1_fgbh1w6,1580662553.0,"I just took some about 10 minutes after I ate because it was time for me to get moving. I usually feel the effects about 10 to 15 minutes after dosing. Sure enough, a few minutes into my shower I started to feel it. Granted, it may just be psychosomatic but if my brain is telling me it's working then that's fine with me. Lol"
kratom,fgb8bbt,t1_fgb70mt,1580659445.0,Let the experimenting begin! Lol it's been about 10 minutes and I have to get my butt moving anyway. Thanks for the response. :)
kratom,fgb7ft5,t1_fgb6vnk,1580659276.0,Thanks for the response. I guess I have a little experimenting to do. :)
funny,fgaqwou,t3_exi8l8,1580654359.0,That's just creepy...
aww,ffpsh5p,t1_ffpqrpi,1580104065.0,How many goats do you know that wear socks? Lol
aww,ffpr0k2,t3_eufxm9,1580102649.0,What goats wear socks?  Lol
aww,ffpqy4j,t1_ffpqtkd,1580102585.0,I just laughed so hard.... TY!
