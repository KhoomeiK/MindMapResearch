aww,ffzknmt,t1_ffzjpef,1580383785.0,ETA generally means edited to add on the internet.
aww,ffzfrl9,t1_ffz3o40,1580376851.0,"Mine plays catch with his pole dangler toy. He drags it around the house under his belly like a lion with a wildebeest, and brings it to you when he wants to play. It’s the cutest.

ETA, you do then have to throw the whole pole thing and he’ll go and drag it back to you. The other one plays fetch with his pipe cleaners (he is obsessed and will play on his own for hours with a balled up pipe cleaner - just patting it about and putting it under furniture so he can fish it out again, and bringing it to you for fetch).

They will also sit for treats, but we’ve not done anything more."
aww,ffzclkm,t3_evpehu,1580372335.0,What a good boy!

AmItheAsshole,ffut9ap,t1_ffuiiiy,1580248912.0,"This blatantly isn’t even an attempt at non-kosher but authentic food, if it’s not only using bacon, but using bacon and cheese together. Even if you replaced the bacon with kosher slaughtered beef, it still wouldn’t be kosher to serve it with cheese.  No authentic flavours and methods at all."
AmItheAsshole,ffr68an,t3_eun0ne,1580151342.0,"YTA. You have to mention religion even when her son is horribly ill? Why not just say your love and well wishes are with her? If you feel that you want to pray, just keep it to yourself. Telling someone who you know isn’t religious that you’ll pray for them is a weirdly passive aggressive thing to do, at a time when she really needs genuine support."
AmItheAsshole,ffiqzvg,t3_etre8y,1579980534.0,"Yeah, YTA. Migraines suck, and I get them too. But you could have brought an eye mask and an audiobook. Or sunglasses. Your migraine is not her problem."
AmItheAsshole,ffimx7y,t1_ffijw4f,1579977718.0,"I have two middle names and a hyphenated first name and the middle names have never been an issue.  I’m in the UK - lots of people have two middle names  so there’s plenty of room on forms and cards.  The hyphenated first name can be a pain as there’s sometimes a character limit and mine adds up to 15 characters.

My first middle name is my Grandma’s, and my second is my Mum’s maiden name as there were no boys in her generation so it was going out of use. I like having them."
AmItheAsshole,ffd6yra,t3_essrci,1579814629.0,"This has got to be a joke, surely? How can anyone be so absurd as to demand a bridesmaid dyes her hair or wears a wig?

On the off chance this isn’t just trolling, YTA. It’s one of the most unreasonable requests I’ve ever heard."
menwritingwomen,ffcy0pu,t3_eswq3t,1579809614.0,"How is driving different from being a passenger? It doesn’t even begin to make sense...

NVM...ignore me...I should read before commenting!"
AmItheAsshole,feyhqbf,t3_eqtevd,1579445742.0,"I’m going NAH. She was indoctrinated, and the first thing she does on beginning to come out of that is contact you. I can understand you being deeply hurt and resentful, but I think she was a child who probably honestly thought that what she was doing was right, as she really didn’t know any better. As soon as she has the opportunity to find out otherwise and learn more about the world, she’s trying to reach out.

I hope you can give her a chance and that she really has changed."
AmItheAsshole,ferneoe,t1_ferld8d,1579356095.0,I went to school with a Kymbaleigh...
hisdarkmaterials,femenxg,t1_felu93p,1579251556.0,"I understand what you’re staying, but in that situation, is ‘just being beaten up’ actually likely? In reality, what happens when large groups of men (especially in an ISIS like culture) with no fear of reprisals meet a solitary woman is often sexual violence. I don’t like the scene, but I also feel that having no rape element is almost unrealistic."
niceguys,feha32n,t3_ep2rlp,1579112295.0,"That’s happened to me. Didn’t match on Tinder, tracked down my Instagram and then wondered why I thought he was creepy."
AmItheAsshole,feczt5f,t3_eoeuu6,1578991590.0,"NTA. Was this person not wearing knickers? Every woman knows you’ve got to be super-careful about see-through leggings, and there’s no way I’m wearing them without knickers underneath if I’m doing squats in public. You pulled her aside and told her discreetly - that’s about as much as you could hope for. Pulling her aside in the middle of a class and telling her would have made everyone stare, surely?"
AmItheAsshole,fdnmns1,t3_em35ua,1578588976.0,"NTA! x eleventy billion. Having a pet means doing what’s best for them, and not putting your own stupid preferences above their health. Your wife needs to get over herself on this one - she should be ashamed of making her cat unhappy because she thinks it looks prettier with long hair.

Grrrrr."
hisdarkmaterials,fdjjc5g,t1_fdir9do,1578473483.0,"I basically loved everything apart from the Malcolm/Lyra potential coupling, too. No, thank you, on that. At all. The rest was great."

hisdarkmaterials,fdd8lv0,t3_ekqqih,1578299803.0,I need to re-read but I thought it was textual that he’s her brother?
AmItheAsshole,fd98ou5,t3_ek7452,1578230046.0,"NTA. What is this ‘blood’ rubbish? He didn’t care about it for eight years when he left you alone with no support, so it doesn’t matter now.

Tell her when she’s 16 or 18 and let her make her own decisions then."
SubredditDrama,fd49ssj,t1_fd45uli,1578165680.0,"People also seem to be assuming that as he’s autistic he’s stupid and incapable of understanding that she’s asking him as a friend, and it does look like they’re friends, to me anyway."
SubredditDrama,fd3gsji,t1_fd35c0l,1578158224.0,"Nah, look at her face. That’s the face of a kind person doing something for a friend, and a really genuine smile."
AmItheAsshole,fd2ee6b,t1_fd2b4ek,1578146022.0,"Eh, I dunno. Friendly bantz would be reheating the OP’s lasagne and having a competition as to whose went first. The refusing to reheat and then texting to complain that it’s been taken home...that’s not friendly."
aww,fcz4oki,t1_fcy7x3g,1578093599.0,Mine too!
AmItheAsshole,fcz0swe,t1_fcyrgwh,1578091375.0,"Yeah you can. I’ve been called while my cat is under to ask whether I approve changes to treatment. If the pet is crashing and they have to make emergency life-saving decisions, that’s different, but they can easily call during routine surgeries."
slowcooking,fcwrxel,t1_fcwf55u,1578035177.0,"I’ve eaten a fair bit of paella in Spain. My best friend’s (Spanish) husband is developing a new pan to help with cooking perfect paella, and he’s a perfectionist. The paella has never been crispy."
aww,fcmqo4j,t3_ehy3a4,1577787446.0,"If pup is scared, why is she not on a lead? She should be on a lead anyway, but especially so if she’s frightened and therefore more likely to behave unpredictably...

I’d have her sitting between my legs under the table, on a lead. Good control, plus she’s being touched/held securely for comfort, and out of the way of other travellers."
