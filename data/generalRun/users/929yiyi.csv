Then I was dared to make out with him, this was what I was dreading the most and we both needed encouragement before we could actually kiss each other.

1.
I was about 5-6 years old at the time, and my mother had a car accident while I was in the car with my sister. She shouldn’t have been driving as she was under the influence of drugs and had broken both of her arms. She first drove through a red light and a car went screeching into the side of the car I was on and then my mother drove off when I was unconscious out of fear from the impact and my mother reached the school as she was driving us to school. My mother had pulled into a space to let another car through and I was back in consciousness since the impact only left a bit of a bump but still the door bent in the slightest part. And she, instead of pulling into reverse, she hit the accelerator and went forward into the car in front. She pulled out and kept driving when I reached to the front and pulled the steering wheel to the side so the car would go to the side and my mum would stop the car and she luckily did. So basically I didn’t end up going to school that day.

2.
I was about 9-10 years old, and I was in the middle of no where bush waking with my dad, I was extremely overweight and after a little I was sooo tired that I started limping but kept falling to my left because I tripped over a rock, on my left was a huge cliff and the path I was on was like 1-2 feet wide. I eventually missed a step and fell down the cliff (it was about a 13 foot fall) and I was lucky enough to have been caught by a medium sized ledge and it took 5 hours for me to finally be back up onto land due to emergency services taking a while to find us.

3.
Last year I had something called a Pilonidal Sinus, it hurts like hell whenever you do anything that might even be trying to walk or sit down. I had it for 5 weeks before I was actually sent to hospital after it going infected. I was really sick and the doctors told my parents who had taken me to the hospital due to the inability to drive, that if it was kept there any longer, there was a huge possibility of me losing the ability to walk. That was what scared me and I knew that if I lost the ability to walk, I’d probably not want to ever live again because that would just be so hard to live like. Thankfully I didn’t lose the ability to walk and the surgery went well but while healing it came back but that’s all fine I’ll be getting a surgery soon enough to stop it from returning."

Then maybe something like volunteering at a food bank to help give food to the homeless is always a good think to do.

Simply buying something soft to eat and a drink for someone homeless and then sit and talk with them is something that often makes a homeless person’s day. They are usually ignored by everyone so just talking to them might seem like a small move, but it might make their day knowing they are still cared.

Visiting elderly people in nursery homes with something like a small gift, is something that might make the elderly really happy. Most of them have been put in there by family and never really get to see their families anymore because the family never visit.

Tipping people at a restaurant is something that is a great move. Usually someone who works at a restaurant as a waiter/waitress, are going through hard financial situations and need all the money they can get.

I have been through years of abuse and neglect because I would not follow my parents orders because I refused to stay in the kitchen and then I was sold off to this creepy guy that wanted me as his wife. I then was married at 12 and was raped multiple times because I “made bad meals” and I would keep on “disobeying orders” which was not the case as I was following every single order he had.

I had 7 children and the daughters were forced to follow as I did. I spent 15 years suffering until I gave up and decided to do something about it. I escaped that shit and just ran into the bushes with my daughters and sons and only my eldest and second eldest refused to leave. So I spent days with my 5 children finding a way to survive and I ran into American explorers and I fell in love with one. I eventually came back with them and a relationship with the guy I fell in love with and I escaped. My original country was Africa but now my country is Australia where we moved and I am officially free.

It is where your hand has a mind of it’s own, one minute you can control your hand and the next, your hand is trying to choke you. 

It was originally thought to be a neurological condition but scientists have recently said otherwise due to a case of a woman that had woken up one day with the condition, but when doctors and specialists examined her, there was no sign of any kind of injury which might have caused the condition. 

Scientists now believe it might be caused by random, uncontrollable muscle spasms which is might occurred by the way that woman might have slept as she was said to have visible bruises on her arm which indicated that she had slept on her arm that night and somehow caused a reaction for the muscles to start spasming.
