OutOfTheLoop,ffe0ut7,t3_et3lgs,1579833795.0,"The Doomsday Clock, which is maintained by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is a metaphor for how close we have come to a man-made global catastrophe like nuclear war or something similar. 

With the clock, the common thought is that 'midnight' is the point where that disaster occurs but honestly that can be changed year to year. The Members who maintain is meet twice a year and take into account all kinds of things to make their judgement, such as political tensions, climate change, energy needs etc. 

The clock is now set 100 seconds to minutes, which is the closest it has ever gotten. In 2018, it was set 2 minutes to midnight due to the tension surrounding handling of nuclear missiles and the threat of Climate Change. However since those tensions have if anything increased its not moved back away yet. 

(The Cuban Missile Crisis, one of the closest points we had gotten to a nuclear war began and then was resolved before the clock could be updated). 

TL:DR: The clock is a metaphor for how close we are to fucking up, and the fact that we are the closest to midnight we have ever gotten is meant to be a message to politicians and business people to pull their heads out and get to work to fix this situation."

litrpg,fe5sk2j,t3_enle84,1578874009.0,"It's an interesting idea. Thinking about it, there are probably a couple ways a 'Cultivation Apocalypse' could be viewed.

* Suddenly, people can cultivate so while everybody starts relatively the same some people are going to quickly exceed human limits. More, lots of people are going to be going on wrong information and might fuck up their cultivation base. This is probably less an apocalypse as society collapsing/cyberpunk style distopia as people pour millions in trying to get the best cultivators on their team, especially as the powerful guys start getting more and more superhuman. 

* Suddenly Earth is accessed by people from a fully realised Cultivator Universe. Mega-corps and nation states collapse as passing masters obliterate fleet groups and pull down governments because they dared to breath the same air as the master. Earth quickly becomes part of the cultivator world and presumedly the MC would be picked up by a passing master or something who isn't just a colossal douchebag. This is the same kind of deconstruction of the superhero trope from Irredeemable/Reckoners/Injustice etc where what do you do when Superman turns up and is a fucking asshole instead of the loveable blue boyscout. 

* There always were Cultivators amongst us but for some reason now they are coming out of the shadows and asserting their power."

if you know any Anime/Manga, a shounen martial arts series probably fits some of them but most don't have the internal alchemy like core formations etc. 

The manga/anime Naruto's 'chakra system' has some elements in common with it, but differs in others. Maybe Hokuto Shin Ken's use of pressure points etc might be another example."

* Only a PC can level up and so he needed to play dumb so he can get to level ten billion, just as he needed to be a PC to get legendary loot drops. 

* With the way games are disected nowadays with wiki's, guides, walkthroughs, and lore video's he now knows all this stuff that might be nigh impossible to find out in game.

As for what to do socially, as mentioned its how you access VR. So work-life wise theirs probably things like virtual offices (so you can do your accounting spreadsheets with all the information you need, but you don't have space taken up by giant filing cabinets).

There are literally hundreds of millions of people in this one massive complex, going about their lives.
