There's even a mod for Skyrim called Enderal which is it's own game entirely, well worth checking out too!"

Hope you're able to do well too, glad I was able to help!"
gamingsuggestions,felto4c,t3_epu2dz,1579230663.0,"Personally I've found Anno 1404 to be the best.

I've played 1602 and 1800; while those are still pretty good, 1602 is pretty old and the path finding for your ships tend to get a little stuck at times which can easily wreck your economy, while 1800 being the newest just feels like you're constantly having to micro manage everything and are not able to fully relax and take your city in. Having said that, i'm very casual with my games and like to take things at my own slow pace, so it might not be a problem for you at all.

They're similar to the Pharaoh/Zeus/Ceasear style of game in that you manage a colony/city with raw resources mined and build things to attract new people/satisfy their needs, build up a military, go to war etc.   
Obviously there is no greater deity to please, but there are random events that can happen, Eg: Volcanic eruption or the plague.

For the price, it's worth picking up, maybe start with 1404 and see how you like it"

depression,fefyin8,t3_eoxun3,1579069539.0,"It obscures my line of thought, making me believe that it's a warm familiar blanket I wrap myself up in. Why would I want to unwrap myself from the ""warmth"" it provides and brave the unknown cold world?"
depression,fbx9iuh,t3_eey2ps,1577175612.0,"Those are definitely symptoms of depression.

There's a fair few online questionnaires you can take to get a better answer, but the best thing you can do is go to your doctor and have a chat about those thoughts/feelings; they're the best starting point to hopefully guide you through it. Friends and family you trust can also help in times of need, be wary that they may not completely understand it and in trying to help may somewhat hinder you in the process, in my experience its still better to try open up about it all and try to talk about it.

I unfortunately don't have an answer as to how to stop it, medication and therapy helps makes things easier to deal with at times, but I've yet to find a way to completely stop the bad days from rolling on in whenever they feel like it.

Hope you're able to get some help with this!"
