They never have."

Games,felq8l4,t1_fek33j7,1579228292.0,"It always puzzles me that David Cage gets THIS much hate and in the same breath you'll hear the gaming community praising a select dozen classic JRPGs for decades for their brilliant stories that effectively amount to a Saturday morning cartoon's quality of writing, drama, and cheesiness."

CallOfDutyMobile,feloy73,t3_eppw9k,1579227398.0,"Solo is 90% bots, so the easiest way to hit legendary. Then again, it's BR so it isn't hard to hit in any queue."
comicbooks,feldxu9,t1_felcqhs,1579219915.0,"They're completely different things, who said they weren't? One is a reimagining and one is a direct sequel. The point I was making is one knew how to wrap a beautifully told self contained story, the other had the CHANCE to do the same and instead ended on a cliffhanger and will probably drag on in mediocrity."
comicbooks,felch8w,t1_felb9f3,1579218936.0,"Yes but it didn't need to, it was so close to being a good one off story and honestly the fact it's all going to go a different direction from here undermines the emotion of the first season. Just because the comic has different material doesn't mean the show needs to, they're almost nothing alike anyway."
comicbooks,fela4bd,t1_fekykfk,1579217394.0,"It frustrates me to no end when good stories wrap up and then get dragged on in to mediocrity later just because they made money.

The Umbrella Academy was an excellent show and I was eagerly looking forward to how the finale wrapped up and being done with it. Well, I don't want to spoil anything but the fact it's getting another season seems completely unnecessary and really soured me on the whole thing."
Games,feiu2xo,t1_fegtmiy,1579147234.0,I thought he meant at launch...
oculus,fehslh6,t1_fehh0ny,1579123048.0,"When I try to wrap my head around the fact the single most biased person on all the internet somehow got a job reporting on the VR industry, it absolutely boggles the mind."

OculusQuest,fe5mnpo,t1_fe54ggt,1578871471.0,"Frankly I can't see the difference in quality using VD vs link cable... Beat Saber is one of the few games where you can feel a latency difference, and I just play the native Quest version instead."

NintendoSwitch,fdzvm5q,t1_fdy5kqe,1578796858.0,There are videos on YouTube of people beating Kirby levels without touching the controller. If that's harder to you than Donkey Kong you have issues.

NintendoSwitch,fcb4f9p,t3_egmhya,1577582213.0,They announced this game WAY too early. Literally dozens of games have been announced and then went on to be released since this game was announced.
