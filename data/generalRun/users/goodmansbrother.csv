GretaThunberg,ffiov4n,t1_ffiokpa,1579979044.0,Her effort to make global climate change awareness. There are so many deniers I’m sure her life is faced with many obstacles and she probably sacrifices much to be a spokesperson.
AbruptChaos,ffiolw8,t3_etpbw6,1579978867.0,Man that’s unreal. Thanks so much for posting that. What are the chances of person would ever see something like that in their life
JoeRogan,ffijmc9,t3_erbtbs,1579975435.0,"Whether it’s MMA fighter’s, Comedians, scientists or stimulating intellectuals , Joe Rogan covers them all. And each one is interesting (even though I’m not an MMA fighter, He makes that interesting too) . His interviewing techniques Are thorough and in-depth. I don’t know where else I would listen to some thing for two hours."
GretaThunberg,ffifwkm,t3_etitxr,1579972908.0,But she does make a difference. Many people would quit in the face of such seeming futility. But not Greta. Each day I’m sure someone else somewhere will change their mind .
Unexpected,ffif5fq,t3_etrmmp,1579972390.0,The car moves in the frame after the mirror is broken. There’s more distance between the top of the car and the top of the frame. How many times is this recorded ? Is Photoshop a great program .
PublicFreakout,ffi8lz5,t1_ffi48i6,1579967902.0,"China's middle class expanded substantially as its urban population grew from constituting 19 percent of its population in 1980 to reach 58 percent in 2017. In 2000, just four percent of China's urban population was considered to be middle class, rising to over 30 percent in 2018.Feb 13, 2019 
Edit: The richest 1 percent owned more than one-third of the total national household wealth, while the poorest 25 percent owned less than 2 percent."

GlobalWarming,fffnqis,t3_eta79b,1579887902.0,So many people are talking about it. None of those in power seem to care about their children’s future though
LateStageCapitalism,fes1sdo,t3_eqc8zd,1579360569.0,Somehow it became a system with a credo of buyer beware. Now the customer is not always right. They can get in line with the hordes of other people. While there still some people to check them out instead of self service .
LateStageCapitalism,feoqw6f,t1_feoo9eq,1579304228.0,"It’s  that race for the pursuit of profit above all that’s become problematic . A driving principal-that has become questionable. This concept of “it’s A-OK for greed” in pursuit of profit above all else,  Is that the cancer of capitalism"
JoeRogan,feooi8j,t1_fenivn3,1579303076.0,Well I am way too old for a tattoo. The wrinkles on the surface are so hard to fuck with. But I’ve been a fan for years and he never gets old as I drive down the road .

One stick of butter and a half a bag of ABV will Goin any mix. It works really well for me. And Iâ€™ve been a long-term enthusiast .

politics,femrbyu,t3_eq0ako,1579267373.0,This is very interesting. Has the power of money faded with the strength of the peoples understanding ?
atheism,felizx0,t3_epsy8x,1579223325.0,Whatever happened to separation of church and state ?
researchchemicals,fel59gc,t1_fekr2kg,1579214346.0,I would say go with pharmaceutical. Healthcare will be a big industry just like computer science. And you express that you have a real interest and enjoy being in that  Everything is cool but youâ€™re very last sentence. I would hate to see the world lose such a bright mind .

kratom,feea74k,t1_fecupc3,1579029581.0,Yes I agree ! It is impossible with any amount . Some in the r/Kratom sub talk of Kilos of consumption in a relatively short period of time . Iâ€™ve never heard of a verified case of death

kratom,fe9l1ze,t1_fe9jh6w,1578938905.0,Either that or they destroy their liver. I think you have to take quite a bit though. Or maybe quite a bit for quite a while .
kratom,fe9kx7x,t1_fe99wwx,1578938823.0,OK I have remove Trump from the formula. The point is that itâ€™s fake news itâ€™s not aimed at Trump in anyway shape or form .
GretaThunberg,fe95qzn,t3_eo64qf,1578934543.0,And we could all be either observers or assistance.
conspiracy,fe95fyb,t3_eo4v6h,1578934406.0,Music is the one of the  strongest stimuli to elicit emotional reaction . Words and lyrics may deal with whatâ€™s on their minds and how they feel. Iâ€™ll bet this has been going on since the beginning of time .

The toxicology report listed ""acute mitragynine intoxication""  Is the only source that turned up on google search . Both of them took me right back to the NPR article. I think that unsubstantiated claim is ludicrous . You would think this wouldâ€™ve made national news."
kratom,fe8w4er,t3_eo4xy3,1578931683.0,This is ! Fake news !
GlobalWarming,fe8n5mg,t3_enz3ui,1578928171.0,As the article says I think heâ€™s a realist. I just hope the world wakes up before itâ€™s too late. I donâ€™t think youâ€™ll ever bring that many people together for a cause in time to save them selves
BipolarReddit,fe2oqtu,t1_fe03fjn,1578841295.0,Iâ€™ve been taking your Lamictal for years. 300 mg a day. Iâ€™m just curious why you quit taking them and what you went to .
bipolar,fdzw2hu,t1_fdyzrfs,1578797175.0,A thoughtful look into linguistic analysis.
wikipedia,fdztqup,t3_enev4a,1578795586.0,That was fascinating. Iâ€™m going to mail the link to every baby owner I know.
PublicFreakout,fdy8je9,t1_fdxfcj5,1578777188.0,That was a very interesting pie chart. Thanks for such a blatant example of what is really happening.
BipolarReddit,fdw9u5p,t3_en08od,1578756553.0,I used to think for as happy as I could be I would have to be equally as sad on the other side. Those that donâ€™t have it will never understand it. They just think they cope better.
agnostic,fdvou9i,t1_fdre9qn,1578749828.0,Interesting reading in that just world hypothesis. One good tenant of religion is the imperfection of humans. Making the same mistakes repetitively throughout time . Whenever I think of religious driven movements I canâ€™t help but think of the childrenâ€™s Crusade . I just Googled it to refresh my memory. -The Disastrous Time Tens of Thousands of Children Tried to Start a Crusade ... https://www.history.com/.amp/news/the-disastrous-time-tens-of-thousands-of-children-tried-to-start-a-crusade
AskReddit,fdr1hxi,t1_fdqs8si,1578678249.0,Thanks for your comment. It reinforces that there are still good people. When greed becomes justified it changes the society .

lostgeneration,fdlegni,t1_fdl5zuc,1578522277.0,Thank you for your enlightening example. Millennials seem to span so many years. I Always place the year 2000 as some sort of reference point. But I see that is not correct. I suppose a generation is about 20 years but I donâ€™t really know. I donâ€™t know what the newest generation is called nor their cutoff age .
Trump_Jokes,fdl1whh,t3_elrk5l,1578515626.0,His mother just taught him how to hate anyone that was in a lower socioeconomic position
CNNauto,fdl1f0c,t3_elwucg,1578515373.0,In his mind he likes a financial war. But at least a different kind of attrition . All tactics that were learned on a monopoly board.
lostgeneration,fdkrvxj,t1_fdjxawz,1578509868.0,"Maybe not to millennials. If itâ€™s old news it may mean youâ€™re a boomer. Recent history does repeat itself from past. But the point here is todayâ€™s soldiers all volunteer. They all asked for the job and now people want to freak out if they got hurt doing their job. If you remember the draft then youâ€™re definitely not a millennial. So what is old news to some is new news to the uninformed. I mean, after all they donâ€™t teach history or civics anymore. Somebody needs the repetitive truth while others want to twist it . Do you also remember Dwight Eisenhower sayingâ€ beware of the military industrial complexâ€?. Letâ€™s not repeat that one because of the money that can be made .There hasnâ€™t been a real war for America since World War II. Even the Vietnam war was the US invading another country.And the other new thing is that there areâ€ no weapons of mass destructionâ€ but letâ€™s go ahead and tear the place up anyway. Spend a few trillion dollars and then talk about people getting free stuff here in America ."
bipolar,fdkoy91,t3_eluqjk,1578508120.0,"Originality, imagination, a truly different vision, are sometimes a gift that comes with the curse. even in the film industry it is so hard to be original; everything seems to be the next chapter or a copy of something already ."
politics,fdkonv2,t3_elt2cx,1578507946.0,Itâ€™s just like Dwight Eisenhower said . Beware of the military industrial complex. Thereâ€™s big money in starting wars.
lostgeneration,fdk69bf,t3_elsly9,1578497027.0,"During Vietnam everyone was drafted. Poor kids didnâ€™t even have a chance . They exempted young people that had enough money to go to college. People with money ,like Trump, suddenly developed bone spurs that Mysteriously disappeared when it was convenient . The rest were feed to the jungle . At least today soldiers make that choice on their own. They have glorified the word â€œwarriorâ€ so they can brainwash people into assuming it is honorable to make war ."

Donald Trump and his evangelical friends were all for the assassination. Now the country is in trouble because of his religious beliefs and their religious believes
CNNauto,fdh9kws,t3_ele7bi,1578418334.0,"A good example of what you donâ€™t say thatâ€™s really important . I wish John Bolton would give a press conference while heâ€™s in his new attitude . Unlike Pompeo ,perhaps heâ€™s developed some honesty ."
CNNauto,fdh63sj,t3_eldymw,1578416182.0,She is young and I believe represents the younger mindset in America. Very few older people and zero Republicans care for her personally. We live in a society that loves to label people. Particularly politicians
atheism,fdgyinr,t1_fdgv44i,1578411439.0,Yes my wording couldâ€™ve been better. Nonetheless your comment is funny as hell .
kratom,fdgp30h,t1_fdg4ub1,1578404527.0,Well now thatâ€™s alarming. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s misinformation or just lack of education .
AntiSemitismInReddit,fdgou9r,t3_ekpwnr,1578404326.0,This phenomenon reminds me of global warming. A sudden change in a society that is being ignored by the majority of the society. Both are extreme and urgent problems

depression,fdefgck,t1_fddm00b,1578337867.0,Who gave you that label  ? Or did you just label yourself ? Many in depression do . Donâ€™t listen to them  and especially donâ€™t listen to you . Donâ€™t become a Self for filling prophecy ... for anyone in any society anywhere.   Donâ€™t wear that yoke and pull that burden. Itâ€™s tough enough with what carrying now . You just need some help to lift that load right now .
Liberal,fd5xhxq,t1_fd5wjd3,1578182739.0,There was a great deal of protest over the Vietnam war. That was the first time the National Guard shot protesters at Kent State University. There was a large movement by large numbers of Americans to see that war come to an end. The power of the people Was brought to bear as the movement became a national consensus .
JoeRogan,fd5wuon,t1_fd5nxm9,1578182503.0,Yes they recently re-publish that but They have known for over a year. That was a wonderful reply. Thatâ€™s what I was looking for some good in depth thoughts

AmItheAsshole,fd3657k,t3_ejuz1p,1578155107.0,I think your cousin was the AH . What a fitting action that you eject her presumptive ass out of the funeral. It was your mother not hers.
kratom,fd358kb,t3_ejx73o,1578154813.0,For a long time I have wondered if the fast strains versus the slow strain is part placebo effect. Then I realized it doesnâ€™t even matter . The effects are the outcome. I would like to know do other people perceive fast versus slow effects.
JoeRogan,fd2z08g,t3_ejy80r,1578153185.0,I bet they are prepared for it. Theyâ€™ve known this for over a year .

kratom,fd2h35e,t1_fd23hmx,1578147120.0,Do you find the Sumatra is slow and the Maeng da is fast . I mean do you perceive any differences between strains ?
askdrugs,fd2fn1r,t1_fczetz7,1578146522.0,I agree Kratom is a good augmentation. You can Google it on the Internet and get a variety of vendors. Make sure to get a fast strain. The Plant or actually itâ€™s a tree is called Mitragyna Speciosa . It is a member of the coffee family of plants. I recommend one called â€œGreen Maeng Daâ€ . This is what I  used to come off Amphetamines that I had been taking for years . Also visit r/Kratom . Now people say this can be addictive too. But itâ€™s nothing compared to pharmaceuticals .

politics,fcxdtvw,t1_fcxa0iv,1578060275.0,Sudan is not a Iran.  That isolated incident is not comparable to starting a war in Iraq based on false assumptions. Tensions were already very high. But using aggression over diplomacy may be war inducing behavior. He shouldâ€™ve engaged Congress before making the single decision to bring America into this . Itâ€™s time to republican party stand up for our country and stop this maniac .

atheism,fculfgw,t1_fcuiuu7,1577983579.0,Thank you for your thoughts. Your key phrase about religions that would condone violence is my bias . I too have felt that many religions are beneficial . Religions that instilled compassion and empathy. If we had millions of Muslims standing up against aggression in their religion I would have a better understanding of differing points of view . I am also a believer of separation of church and state as it is written in our Constitution.
