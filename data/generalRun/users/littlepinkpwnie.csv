I honestly wish that stupid 3dio mic with the fake ears was never invented, just seeing that thing makes me feel queasy knowing that there are so many videos out there of half naked women licking that thing. It makes me sick to my stomach just thinking about it. I just found Ozley ASMR and I really like her videos, she makes me feel like she's my friend and that she cares a lot and it's a very warming feeling."

datingoverthirty,ff6ght9,t3_erbwdq,1579626688.0,"I've been seeing a guy for two months. We saw each other this weekend. He confessed that he doesn't love me. I was shocked at first, but once I calmed down and got my thoughts together, I realized that I don't love him either, and that's okay. Neither of us have ever had a healthy relationship. I realized after a lot of self reflection that I do finally want something that is healthy. To me infatuation and obsession are NOT healthy. I think that if we felt those feelings now after only two months it wouldn't be real love it would probably be obsession and ultimately it wouldn't be healthy. It was a hard conversation to have, and there was a lot of emotion. He was afraid I'd never speak with him again. He also had made some assumptions about the type of relationship I wanted. One thing that he said that really stuck out to me was that, ""this doesn't feel like it did before."" Meaning, what we have doesn't feel like it did with his other relationships. To him initially, that was a bad thing. To me, that's good. I don't want it to feel like all the other times. Those other times were unhealthy. At the end of the conversation the only thing I asked of him was to be open and to give it more time. I truly mean that. I don't mean we're going to revisit this in a month or two. I think love, real love, not obsession or infatuation, takes time. Love and relationships have rest of our lives implications, and that's not something that should only take two months. Ultimately, as hard as this conversation was, it was a good thing. I think we're much closer after having it. As someone who has suffered from anxiety and depression most of my life I'm really proud of how I handled this. I haven't been ""hysterical"" I cried initially but not since. If this happened before my anxiety would have taken over and I would have been inconsolable. I probably would have never spoken to him again. I've made so much progress in becoming a better version of myself and not allowing my anxiety to run my life. I'm excited to continue working on myself, and I'm excited to spend more time with him and create many happy memories in the many months to come. Most of all I'm excited to give this the time it needs to grow."

SuicideWatch,fekcvjt,t1_fekbgvq,1579197396.0,"I’m not bored at all! Ever! Haven’t you been paying attention? I do so many things! I cook and i go to restaurants and I read books, I go to new places, I go to concerts, I play video games, I go shopping. I may be many things but bored isn’t one of them. There are so many things to do in this world I can’t imagine how anyone could ever be bored. Usually when I go out I put in my headphones and listen to music or I read. I don’t usually interact with anyone. When I play games, it’s online because Destiny 2 is only online but I don’t play with anyone I know. I usually listen to music or podcasts when I’m playing. I talk to my coworkers a little but my job is a pretty lone wolf type of job (i work in a call center). The only person in this world who is going to choose you is yourself. You can’t rely on anyone else for that. Plus, no one wants to be your built in therapy. No one wants to be the thing you rely on to make you whole or to make you feel better. Do you know what kind of pressure that puts on someone? Do you want to be the guy that traps someone in a friendship/relationship because you threaten suicide every time they try to leave? Do you want to be what makes someone else unhappy because you rely on them so heavily for your self esteem and happiness? No one wants to be in a friendship/relationship like that. You need to learn how to be okay and learn how to be happy by yourself, to be someone that another person wants in their life."
SuicideWatch,fekb1xu,t1_fek9vjo,1579196319.0,"I wouldn't say I've given up but I certainly don't seek out human affection or interaction. I don't feel a need to. My life is more stable and I'm happier on my own than I ever was with anyone else. I don't want kids because I have two chronic illnesses that I could pass on to children and I don't want to do that to them. I don't really think about wanting/needing someone to share my life with. It's not something that crosses my mind usually. Why should it? My life is full and I am happy exactly where I am. I work full time, I have a car, an apartment, anything I could want really. Believe me you do not want to experience a bad relationship. What that does to your head, takes YEARS to get over and that's just one bad relationship. You keep piling them up, and it gets worse and worse. I'm very happy. I come home to my cat every day. He's very happy to see me. We cuddle. I make myself dinner. I play ps4, or I watch netflix. I LOVE reading, I curl up on the couch with a warm blanket and read a really good book. On the weekends I go out to dinner or I find a new recipe to learn. I just made peanut butter no bake cookies for the first time, they turned out great! I'm on my 5th book of the year. I love to watch stand up comedy because I love to laugh. I recently started watching british TV shows because they're so good. I could go on and on. I rarely cry anymore, I haven't had a panic attack in quite awhile. I was thinking about volunteering at a shelter to snuggle the animals or something like that. I love music and finding new music to enjoy. I'm even going to a concert in March! There is nothing people in relationships or with big friend groups do that I can't do on my own, except maybe play board games. You're addicted to the idea that you need a relationship or you need friends to have a good life, and that's just not true. You can't begin to heal until you can admit that to yourself."
SuicideWatch,fek902w,t1_fek6x2q,1579195111.0,"Okay lets talk about what I've had before. My mom was abusive, from the time i can remember she called me ugly and fat. She told me I had no friends because I was mean. I was severely bullied in school to the point where they'd hit, kick, and push me. They'd put gum in my hair. They'd steal my homework. We were poor so they picked on my clothes. they'd call me fat and ugly. I cut myself for the first time when I was like 10. I didn't even know what depression or suicide meant. All I knew was that I was a 10 year old that hated myself. I cut myself until I was 16 or 17. I'm currently 35 and I still have scars from that. I didn't have my first boyfriend until I was 18. I was with him for 7 hears. He was very emotionally abusive. He told me how ugly and worthless and stupid I was. He told me that no one else would ever put up with me. For 7 years I lived with that because I thought it was normal because that's how my mom treated me. I finally got out in 2009. I started seeing someone new and it was good until I got sick with a chronic illness that I have to this day. He left me because I could no longer be his maid or his cook. He was embarrassed of me. Now not only was I dealing with trauma from my mom and my ex, but I was dealing with a chronic illness all alone. Doctors to this day still don't understand that I don't have a good support system, and I struggle with my illness because of it. The next 3 relationships ended up in me being cheated on. One of them was sleeping with up to 9 other women that I know of, possibly more. He was using us all for money. I went on a first date with a guy who then followed me home and robbed my apartment the next day. I've been ghosted so many times that I've lost count. I've been told I'm not the kind of woman men date because of how I look and that I'm embarrassing. I've never had a good healthy relationship with anyone. I can't even say that I know what it feels like to be loved. It's not a thing I've ever felt like I've had in my life. I've been through more trauma than most people experience in a life time and I'm only 35. I've had so much therapy, I've read every self help book that I could get my hands on. I meditate. I journal. I cry and I yell and I scream. I'm on medication to control some of the worst anxiety some doctors have ever seen. Please do not talk to me about hypocrisy or ""what I've had before"" because what I've had before has been so awful and so traumatic that I wouldn't wish it on anyone. The reason I tell you or anyone about this is because you can be okay, but it's going to be fucking hard. You're going to have to go to battle every single day with your own mind. The voices in your head will lie to you and you have to learn how to ignore it and it'll be the hardest thing you ever do. You have to fight against societal norms that tell you that you have to be close to your family and that you have to have friends and that you have to be in a relationship to be happy. It's all bullshit. At the end of the day you have to want to do it. It's not going to be a thing that just happens to you, and it's not going to be easy."
SuicideWatch,fek5ftr,t1_fejxrpe,1579192996.0,"You can believe what you'd like. My mom is abusive, my best friend moved away, I've been single for 6 years since my ex cheated on me. Since then I worked on getting over the trauma I experienced as a kid. I go out to dinner and go to the movies by myself. I enjoy it. I play video games, I read books, I binge watch netflix, I go shopping, all of it alone. I have a cat that I adore. I work full time, my coworkers are friendly but we don't socialize outside of work. There is nothing wrong with my life. I don't have a burning need to have friends or a relationship. My life is no less full than anyone elses. Just because the way I live my life is different doesn't mean it's bad. This is the hand I've been dealt. Instead of being depressed and wishing things were different, I've embraced the way things are and I've learned to be happy with what I have. The grass isn't always greener, I chose to make the grass greener exactly where I am, and I think I've become a better person because of it."
SuicideWatch,fejv08h,t3_epjet1,1579186476.0,"This is a common theme in this reddit and I don't understand why. You don't need a relationship or friends to live your best life. There is so much more to life than that. Do the things you love do the things that make you happy. Have hobbies, cook, go to the gym, play video games, read, go to the movies, all of those are things you can do alone. You absolutely can lead a fulfilling life without someone else in it. I don't have any friends and I'm not close to my family. I live alone. There are tons of things I love doing and my life isn't worth less or isn't any less full because I'm alone."
