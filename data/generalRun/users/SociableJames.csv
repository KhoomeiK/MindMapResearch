Umphreys,fffk4p3,t1_fffjpxa,1579885696.0,"While this was true last year... it's not always that way.  Some years they're in the Red Barn (must be VIP or purchase an extra ""Red Barn ticket"") on other nights and some years they don't do a Red Barn at all.  

But yeah, here's hoping for 4 nights of UM like last year!!"
Umphreys,fffjkci,t3_etcn3b,1579885340.0,"This year will be my 12th Scamp in a row.  Summercamp is Umphrey's home fest.  Moe. started it but UM has joined them as co-hosts of the fest.  

USUALLY it's 2 sets Friday, 2 sets Saturday, and 1 set Sunday.  Being that it's ""their"" fest they do whatever they want.  Test out new lighting/sound rigs, debut songs, and overall just rage their fest all weekend long as you'd expect.  

They also do lots of sit-ins with other bands and can be found mingling with fans throughout the weekend.  There's lots of other stuff like their annual Golden Ticket event where you buy bags of merch that could have various ""golden tickets"" in them for all sorts of awesome prizes.  

Overall, Summercamp is one of the true ""meccas"" for UM fans.  You'll get more UM than any other fest and they NEVER disappoint!!"

aww,fdp0b3s,t3_emg19m,1578616968.0,Omg that look!  Companion for life!
jambands,fdozb64,t3_eme6m6,1578616308.0,Tragically accurate.
aww,fdoig93,t1_fdofzt3,1578605799.0,IDK.  This one was released back into the wild.
aww,fdo6hw4,t1_fdo59fb,1578599737.0,yawn.
aww,fdo6fsd,t1_fdo64wn,1578599708.0,"Actually, aside from this vid I was very careful not to imprint on her.  She has successfully released back in the wild!    Awesome story about yours though!  So cool!"
aww,fdo28y9,t1_fdnz9rl,1578597554.0,"I saved one baby bird.  L.M.A.O.  

... and I'll do it again too."
aww,fdnwwok,t1_fdnsmec,1578594502.0,Just posted the link to my original FB post.  Lots of good pics and a couple videos!
aww,fdnwupl,t1_fdnwmc1,1578594469.0,Why wouldn't you rescue any helpless animal in need?
aww,fdnwszk,t1_fdnwjpf,1578594441.0,They're known as that because they're everywhere in the US but apparently not native to the US.  But they're as common as sparrows in the midwest.  Either way I couldn't just leave a helpless animal to die.
aww,fdnwiaz,t3_embz8c,1578594271.0,"Here’s the link to my original FB post about the whole rescue!

aww,fdnsarg,t1_fdnr2ho,1578591824.0,She’s actually already been released.  She was great at eating too.  It was a lot of work but I couldn’t be happier with how well she did.  Found her on the ground in a parking garage with no nest in sight.
aww,fdns4bs,t1_fdnp6ph,1578591720.0,"I do!  Lots of them!  Kind of a Reddit noob though, can I post photos in comments?"
YangForPresidentHQ,fbe6624,t3_ecttf7,1576779072.0,"Tbh the whole ""impassioned internet following"" is severely underselling Yang's support.  It's more common than not to run into people who not only know AY but have nothing but positive things to say.  I think the primaries are going to surprise a lot of people who think they're ""in the know""."
