chernobyl,fegs4qv,t1_fegqck2,1579101262.0,"No, because it wouldn’t have blown up. It shut down to prevent a major disaster on top of the devastation the area already received. Here’s an excerpt from the wiki page about the [2011 Super Outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Super_Outbreak): “TVA lost the ability to transmit power from both Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant and Widows Creek Fossil Plant after the storms on April 27, requiring both to be shut down. The nuclear plant's cold shutdown was supported by diesel generators for four days until a second 161kV line could be restored to the plant. The loss of redundant off-site power required a ""notification of unusual event"", the lowest of four levels of concern dictated by the NRC.”"
chernobyl,fegoz0y,t3_ep1gcp,1579099088.0,No. There’s a nuclear plant about half an hour away from my house. It scrammed (as it should have) in April 2011 due to the transmission lines being mangled by tornadoes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browns_Ferry_Nuclear_Plant

Still funny though."
Invisalign,fdy3cms,t1_fdy0htb,1578775626.0,"Retainers are supposed to be less flexible than the trays so they can hold up longer. If you’re wearing something stiffer and your teeth have shifted even a little on the days you don’t wear them it makes sense they would crack. After I had braces when I was a kid, I had clear retainers. They were noticeably thicker than my Invisalign trays. They were also somewhat loose. I could pop them out with my tongue barely pushing."
