My first sentence: ""Congratulations on our baby!""

I got shit for that for a few months.  Her husband, who was this huge dude, come up to me at a happy hour and came up to me and asked me, ""You fooling around with my WIFE?!""

I didn't know the guy (never met her husband).  Scared the fucking shit out of me.

Turns out the co-worker put him up to it."

ProgrammerHumor,fdfdifi,t1_fdfb0fo,1578359146.0,"Most documentation is written for programmers so if you are a novice it will be hard to read.  But it doesn't mean you shouldn't.

This is all the reason why you should either go to a class or read basic programming documentation like freecodecamp or learnpython.

A professional programmer often doesn't have the time or the capacity to explain what an if statement is or why it works or why you would use it over something else.  But they are happy to tell you that what the syntax is in their favorite language. 

I'm a pretty good JavaScript developer but I dabble in Python. For the life of me, I can never remember how loops work in Python.  I look this up in the documentation.  But if I have a question about whether I should use a dict or a list in my specific use case, I'll ask someone. 

We all start somewhere and we're willing to help you out but tell us where you're stuck. If you just say, ""I don't get it just show me,"" I hate to say it but you won't get much help.

The basic concepts build on more complex ones.  When you read the documentation, what specifically confuses you?  What are you trying to accomplish and what have you already tried?

Keep at it!  Hopefully you'll meet nice people along the way."
ProgrammerHumor,fdf7uqj,t1_fdf27nn,1578355330.0,"If you're getting a lot of different people telling you to read the documentation, it usually means you're asking about something basic or trivial.  Yes, I could tell you but someone much more capable had already written it and has published it.

Reading documentation and learning how to read documentation is a great skill.  It takes patience and practice and you can learn it by doing it.

That being said, I'm sorry that people dismissed you by telling you to read the documentation. But it does sound like you would prefer someone to hold your hand while you learn. This is perfectly fine, but keep in mind that is what classes are for.  The random programmer at work or even on stack overflow is going to see your elementary question and push you to read documentation.  If you personally need something more curated, I would encourage you to enroll in a class where a teacher can walk you through your question. But know that reading documentation will always be a part of being a programmer."

AmItheAsshole,fda5tel,t1_fd9hdnv,1578242099.0,"I think it depends on the context.  If the parents are offering for the grandparents to move with them, and they have a great relationship with them, it sounds like a win-win.  But to demand it is something else.

The dog and the bird were friends but there is no evidence that the person who took the picture adopted the dog.

The picture was taken about 10 years ago in Turkey where stray dogs are very common.  The pelican has since died.

But your summary was enough for me to get the gist. 

I absolutely loved the concept though. I think if I was a bit older I probably would have been able to play it. It kind of sounds like Mass Effect took some elements from XCOM and I was fine playing that.

Funny story, I tried playing XCOM again using I think DOSBox or something and I still couldn't play it. It took me back to as a kid and was still scared shitless. 

It's kind of funny how the brain works.  The graphics aren't that great (compared to today), I am an adult that has played other more scary games and I know this isn't real, but my monkey brain just goes back to that memory if playing it on my old 486 computer in the dead middle of night and being scared at the bad aliens shooting at me."

ProgrammerHumor,fcy0lln,t1_fcxojxl,1578073074.0,"By analogy, think about going to a restaurant.  You are given a menu where you decide what to eat. The menu tells you what you'll get if you order it.

The programming part is you telling the waiter what you want.  If you don't speak the language, then you can't order anything. 

The kitchen is the computer doing what it does at the bit/assembly level. You don't necessarily have to care...though if you want to you can.

After the kitchen/computer is done, it delivers a result. Maybe you said something wrong or the waiter misheard you.  Or if you're lucky, you get exactly what you wanted.

But getting this right is what programmers do."

We got on the topic of pets and such and she believed the whole dogs are bad luck thing. It struck me as odd because she's seen pictures of my dog, commented how cute he was, how much fun he was to be around when my wife and I had her family over for dinner. 

She said that she knows it's superstition but it's hard to shake because she grew up with it. Her family would never get a dog but completely supported other people having dogs. 

She never petted him...but definitely gushed and even gotten him a toy every once in a while.

Overall pretty chill."

Or any of the hundreds of free email sources (10minute email, mailinator, etc.)

Using whitehouse.gov only works if the email doesn't require confirmation. For example, the wifi at my local airport requires an email address. I use the Whitehouse email for that.

Not sure if it would have worked for this app. But there you go."
