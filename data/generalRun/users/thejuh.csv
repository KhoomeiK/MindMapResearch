todayilearned,ffh6xrq,t1_ffh37o1,1579924824.0,"There is currently no way to store power in the quantities required to service demand peaks. This is common knowledge, the reason for all this infrastructure debate, and the entire subject of discussion on this thread. You are making an extraordinary claim, which requires proof on your part. Since we can't use chemical batteries, hydro, or mechanical storage to meet peak demands, what would you use to supply demand? It is simple physics that you must store the energy (which we cannot do now), produce on demand (which we cannot do with renewables), or reduce demand.

I have upvoted your posts to provoke discussion. What solutions do you see to solving this issue? I agree that the overall goal is to get to renewables, even if not initially cost effective."
