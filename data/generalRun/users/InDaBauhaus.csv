Aby kladívko na tříštění skla efektivně zafungovalo, musí se udeřit pod správným úhlem (při správné instalaci shora dolů mezi 90 ° a 60 °). Je to dáno procesem tvrzení skla a jeho orientovanou krystalickou strukturou. Pokud by někdo udeřil zespodu, je možé, že se sklo nerozbije a diamantový/karbidový hrot se poškodí. Nejspíš se přišlo při inspekci na pochybení při instalaci, tak nalepili samolepku v této orientaci, aby odpovídala normovým požadavkům a instrukce vedly k úspěšnému roztříštění skla.
