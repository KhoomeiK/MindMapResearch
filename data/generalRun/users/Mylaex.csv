First of all, I cannot believe in 2020 some girls can still think they should EVER need to tell a man ""I'll keep my mouth shut"" Hell. To the motherfucking. No. If a man tells you to shut up, girl be louder, prouder, meaner and stronger. That is some grade-a bullshit right there. 

Also, why the fuck does she think it's ok for her dad to act so disgustingly towards Teresa? Dolores got the facts on straight. Teresa's the boss and breadwinner of the family now so mind your own business and don't tell her how to spend her money. She's not gonna tell you how to spend yours, you have no right to tell her how to spend her own. She puts a roof over her head and keeps her children well fed, clothed and educated? The rest is her business. 

Honestly I was thinking about that awful Britney Spears circus cover she did that Teresa financed years ago and how Gia might not be so innocent to the scams her parents were pulling. She could know more than they're letting her on and I wouldn't be totally shocked if she was fine with the fraud they pulled, she's just pissed they got caught."
