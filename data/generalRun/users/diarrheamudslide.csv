EDIT: His 13 year old daughter was on the plane, also. This family has to grieve in the public eye."
facepalm,ffmy76w,t3_eu1884,1580060144.0,I like to think this was a malicious compliance move on someone's end. Props to them.
todayilearned,ffmxkn3,t1_ffmar2t,1580059937.0,I feel like the next logical step would be a personal pod. Like a top for your cubicle. It could even be fabric like a tent.
entitledparents,ffids93,t3_etqjrf,1579971467.0,They made your sister bleed from her ears after just getting her hearing aids. You should have pressed charges. I don't like this fake story.
dogswithjobs,ffi9xwu,t1_ffh46vx,1579968839.0,Are you interested in adopting an adult human? I don't eat too much and I'll help with taking care of my dog brother.
antiMLM,ffhvmq8,t3_etg8tm,1579955980.0,One time my prof tried to have a class where we let some group know anout our ratings for the prof. I left. I’m not there to evaluate the prof. I’m there to learn about the topic I paid money to learn. I have other things more important and I told them as much then and when I came in next class and told the prof. I’m not there to be bothered with bullshit. Either teach me what I’m paying for or get the fuck out of my way. Idiots.

trashy,fffq6gc,t3_et58v4,1579889403.0,My friend works as a banker. She was able to help one of her clients by going to them to have paperwork signed as the client was in a hospital. Why other banks can't offer your parents a similar service is reprehensible. I hope more people see this and close their accounts with those assholes.

badwomensanatomy,ffey9m0,t1_ffcjqw4,1579870204.0,"Yea, thank god you didn’t actually date this nut."
funny,ffevvzs,t3_et1xuj,1579867750.0,Only way the kid gets to eat. Their  fucking parent refuses to just feed them. How else is the kid supposed to eat? He needs to be quick and accurate because the parent is a dick.
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffd8pwm,t3_ess94s,1579815613.0,"If yours is the cable lock, that won't last. He can probably chew it off. Buy a better bike if you live in a high crime area. Those cables are a joke."
trashy,ffd86cs,t3_ess8ak,1579815299.0,Are you sure this isn't a man?
PublicFreakout,ffc96a3,t1_ffc2jx5,1579794395.0,She's doing a damn fine job. She should get a promotion.
