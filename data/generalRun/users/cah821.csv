aspergers,fdxtt6x,t1_fdxr9yt,1578772852.0,Yes.
aspergers,fdxk85k,t3_enaw4e,1578769563.0,"Yes, I can understand. I overcompensated by getting a degree in English literature because i needed better comprehension of thought and communication. Before that I was stuck in my head."
aspergirls,fdxfyp5,t3_en2bu0,1578768366.0,Cry if you can or pick up an exercise that you like. Petting my dog calms me. I tend to rationalize the problem then work out some sort of solution.
aspergirls,fdx5tto,t3_en5eky,1578765599.0,"Married for 7 years. We mostly communicate to the dog :). We also finally talked to resolve a few trouble spots. I don’t know what is my husbands diagnosis but he thinks he’s an NT.  We don’t argue often at all. Communication is sincere. We’re not emotional nor romantic. We just are.  Also, being friends before dating is important."
aspergers,fdsnhff,t3_emzr8a,1578705514.0,"I noticed the other day at the store that I still get nervous with eye contact. So what I did is look away then back a few times instead of a steady gaze.  It’s not perfect, but I don’t think the store clerk noticed either."

aspergers,fds5ha4,t3_emxp0y,1578694795.0,"It doesn’t hurt to ask for work from home days. I know someone who chose Monday and Friday. Maybe get an actual cubicle so that you can focus? What a great manager you have for even asking even if you don’t everything you want, it starts a positive relationship."
aspergers,fds1l2y,t3_elonwk,1578692966.0,I would say that i am capable of being social but I don’t have any friends. So I make lots of acquaintances over the years. Then the relationships are on social media. I consider myself introverted-extroverted.

aspergers,fdr8208,t3_emtl8v,1578680723.0,"I think this is an aspie trait. You notice language patterns. I can absolutely relate. I try not to use the same words repeatedly if I can help it. I made sure my college papers had no repetition of words. At work, however, I mask in email and I do cringe when I type, Can you look at this? Lol. Instead of, would you take a look? Only an aspie would notice this stuff. It is annoying...this is such an interesting point. And it’s not an attack on NTs."
aspergers,fdr027y,t3_emdimb,1578677727.0,"Relationships need to be in close proximity in order for it to develop.  Now it’s ok to be friends with her, but don’t tell her just yet. Maybe you’ll be together in the future, that’s a possibility, but you should be in the same area. This guy that I once knew was stuck being infatuated with unattainable people because he kept a distance.  Just be aware of patterns. Typically, relationships start with wanting to be together in person. 

Sorry for my short response earlier. I was out doing errands!"
aspergers,fdp3193,t3_emdimb,1578618804.0,I once knew a guy who only was attracted to long distance relationships because he couldn’t bond with them. Don’t tell her.

narcissisticparents,fdoiu1j,t3_emg6k7,1578606018.0,"The root of your problem is not initiative, it’s fear of doing something not right.

narcissisticparents,fdnzugu,t3_emaey5,1578596211.0,Legal battles are expensive so I would think about it carefully before proceeding. My father killed and abused my cat and dog when I was a child so I can understand. I’m so sorry about Midnight.  There is no easy solution to this because your father is mentally sick.

aspergers,fdlpibz,t3_em0r1b,1578529406.0,There’s a work culture which is not always supportive so I understand you. I used to suffer from crushing anxiety because of it. I used to meditate to cope or just constantly work to prove to myself  that I am competent.
narcissisticparents,fdllo9b,t3_em0cui,1578526835.0,"Sounds like a cycle of mental abuse.  This is not a normal, healthy relationship.  You will never win any arguments with her."
narcissisticparents,fdlfybk,t3_elzss5,1578523182.0,I haven’t seen Nmom in over 8 years until recently and no flashbacks to childhood.  She didn’t say much so there wasn’t any conflict. Best outcome.  I am still keeping my distance.

Right, I see doctors as mostly resources since I know my own abilities best."
aspergers,fdiueol,t1_fdisfeb,1578451264.0,"Ah that is interesting. Whiteboards are great! So, In college I didn’t have any friends and I studied very intensely.  I can mask ok and appeared social and was unaware of my isolation. When I graduated I got a job at front desk and the first time I answered the phone I forgot what to say,  such as Hello, so I literally croaked. An office worker heard me and said that I was an idiot out loud. Never forgot it and had anxiety everyday thereafter. I just kept working at it and have been articulate ever since. I didn’t know that I was autistic though. I’ll find out more in my next doctors visit what exactly I have."
narcissisticparents,fdijw5k,t3_elkqlo,1578444553.0,That’s great! I hope you and your sibling are safe and well.
aspergers,fdii9f0,t3_elevqf,1578443518.0,Yes I talk out loud when I study. I also have a whiteboard to scribble thoughts. Sometimes I have to do both for me to really remember things. Talking out loud allows me to not be mute which I tend to do. I have forgotten how to talk in the past and I never want that to happen again because it was so humiliating.
confession,fdifiqy,t3_eljlhv,1578441743.0,Wonderful. Leaving takes a lot of courage!.  Now you’re on the road to recovery and healing. One day at a time. You’re not alone.
funny,fdhs9qb,t3_elfvqr,1578429197.0,"I’m a woman and a human being. If I were her I would feel awful right now. She probably was just having a bad day. We are all entitled to this. Leave her alone.  As for name a woman, I choose her. She could be any of us."

narcissisticparents,fdfvvxa,t3_el56pc,1578371615.0,"Yeah it probably feels good when a mother approves of something but I gave up needing anybody’s approval and I’m better for it.  Nmom enjoys making son feel inadequate. Nmom thrives on conflict but if there is nothing to argue about then Nmom can’t attack the son anymore. This is important because nmom is his abuser. Culturally speaking, I understand that being independent from nmom might be difficult at first but you might want to consider it for the benefit of your (husband and you) mental health."

narcissisticparents,fdfef1e,t3_el21uq,1578359753.0,Good that you’ve moved out. You need to take care of your mental health. I separated from my nmom at 38. Never look back.  Limit your interaction with her as much as you can because she is looking for a victim to create conflict. You might attract narcissists in your life because of your mother. Just be aware and stay away from them. Work on your self-confidence because you are important. Congrats you’re free!
aspergers,fdfcolb,t3_el2a7i,1578358580.0,"Sounds like a phrase meant for married couples or committed relationships. With my pets definitely. Not everyone who says this means it, but they should."
aspergers,fdf739i,t3_el25l7,1578354822.0,I also feel deeply even with Aspergers. I understand you. Forget about these losers and move on.  I usually give myself time to grieve and get it out of my system then block these people out of my life as best that I can.  There is one person who tries to bully me but I just ignore her (a narcissist) but then I cry later. I’m in my late 40’s. It does get easier and it stays the same. You’re not alone.
narcissisticparents,fdf3eef,t3_el06d3,1578352399.0,"No, children will make you more anxious and then some."
narcissisticparents,fdf0oac,t3_el1i3x,1578350657.0,"I understand you. My brother is the same way. Constantly anxious. Not sure who to trust. When you do trust you waffle then you attack to protect yourself. You’re just not sure.  I hear you. As a result, So you have trouble bonding with lasting friendships, etc.? You probably should talk to a psychologist, to be honest. I think it has something to do with the mother-son bonding that did not take place. I read that somewhere.  Good luck and you’re not alone."
narcissisticparents,fdezzt4,t3_el17ev,1578350233.0,"My Nmom made my life hell when I was a kid and most of my adult life. Only way to deal with narcissists is to not let them control your life as best as you can. Be aware that the narcissistic parent or parents create an imprint in you and your relationships forever.  You may naturally attract narcissists. That’s life. It’s like an illness. Protect yourself by keeping a safe distance.  That’s what I’ve been doing. 

Edit: Also I should add that I did become estranged by nmom for 8 years. She only emails me nowadays and I don’t respond so there is no conflict.  I get panic attacks from the narcissists I attracted over the years who I thought were friends but they are at a safe distance now.  I don’t talk to them at all. For the most part I lead a peaceful, happy life. There is hope."
aspergers,fdelqn1,t3_ekv4gb,1578341699.0,I couldn’t look at someone in the eyes until middle school. I was shy and so awkward! I’m older now in my 40s and got used it so it’s not a problem anymore.  It got easier for me over time. Direct eye contact is important to be taken seriously. I could be intimidating so I had to ease up. Takes practice to get it right.
narcissisticparents,fdelgz2,t3_ekwazu,1578341538.0,It’s ok. Just ignore her. She’s not going to change.
aspergers,fde9ktr,t3_ekt4g2,1578334184.0,I have a degree in English literature. Worked in IT Operations for 15 years and enjoyed it so you’re on track with studying the CS/linguistics degrees. I had to take a break from work due to a manic episode but going back soon I hope.
narcissisticparents,fdd300v,t3_ekq4dh,1578292704.0,Separate from your abusers. You are responsible for your own welfare.  There is just too much conflict.
narcissisticparents,fdd2ftv,t3_eko6xf,1578292088.0,Sorry to hear. Maybe you should leave the situation and move to a safe place. Start your life over.
