This atop of a million other suicidal thoughts and a fuck ton of pressures from home, school, and society...when I was with her I thought I would never have to be alone again."

SuicideWatch,ffb6pgj,t3_esnpwy,1579753262.0,"Took the words out of my mouth. Except the reason why I don’t want to make a big deal out of my suicidal tendencies is because I don’t want the attention. People will pity me, ask questions, realize there’s nothing they can do, and then they go away. It was comforting knowing anybody could help me but when the cards are down and I find myself truly alone...well I guess I’m scared I’ll find out nobody loves me. Even if they do, it’s pity love. Not love for who I am."
SuicideWatch,ff9vq0a,t1_ff9vdl5,1579722546.0,"Kinda. I know I have to ride it out. And whatever happens happens. I miss her so much and I miss not being alone. That’s not a good reason for her to come back; that’s pity, not love. I need to love myself before I can love and be loved. Except I haven’t loved myself in a long time. Just as people repress tears, I’ve repressed happiness because I got used to being disappointed all the time. I thought this time would be different. And now I’m worse than where I began. Whatever happens happens, I just have to ride it out. So yes I wanna talk. But nothing I say will do anything. I don’t know what to do. So many other things are happening that it’s small fry in comparison. But to me, it means so much. Now I’m lonely in my time of need."

SuicideWatch,ff7z90z,t3_es07op,1579661915.0,"Same. I wish the light post will break and electrocute me. The car in front will stop suddenly and the crash will somehow kill me. Or some freak apocalypse sweeps me away in some grandiose way. And when it’s not that, I imagine what it’s like to have a bullet, Pierre my skin, grind through my skull, send cracks throughout my skull, enter my brain, grind up the tissue, swim through all the way to the other side, press into my skull, grinding its way through, and then out the other side."
SuicideWatch,ff2h7ks,t3_er7i28,1579505996.0,"How can I help when I can barely help myself? As MLK said, “A man has not discovered something that he will die for, he isn't fit to live.”  I can’t help but feel that every thing that has ever happened has created the world we live in today. Sure, Einstein founded some equation that improved the quality of life of people or John Saulk founded the cure to polio. From all these great things, we get the world we live in today and it is so much better than the world our ancestors lived in. But just as how all good things have contributed to this world, they have contributed to the bad. And just as good things created bad things, bad things created good things. If there wasn’t a Cold War, we may have never gotten to the moon or created digital technology. Without hitler, we wouldn’t have the lesson of what hate and racism does to each other. 
That leaves me with how my life would be. Would my life or in this case, your life, be a bad thing, something terrible and painful, create some good in the future? Cause it very much could."
SuicideWatch,ff2gpwn,t3_er4v52,1579505395.0,"From a cynical sense, every decision everybody has made is driven by instincts. The instinct to survive. The instinct to acquire things. The instinct to accumulate wealth, status, and power. The instinct to socialize, mingle, and be with others. Family and love a mammalian construct. Friendships are people who don’t want to be alone. Success is measured on how far from failure i.e. not being human we are. Without these instincts, we are nothing. Everyday, every interaction, everything is driven by these baser, primal instincts and from that, I see that nothing is genuine or real; every action is done for the sake of self preservation or for the sake of fulfilling one of these primal instincts. We can’t control these instincts. It’s like flinching; it’s only natural. The only thing that isn’t instinctual is death so in death, will I find the purest sense of things."
