From what you said, without knowing the exact words that were exchanged, yes you grossly exaggerated and assumed a ton of stereotypes yourself. If they came to you and only said ""you could have brought something home made"" as a critique to your zero-effort Aldi muffins and you immediately went ballistic like that, you really are an a-hole. Even if it is true that none of them cooked anything, even if it is true that their wives made whatever they brought, you still assume that their are in somekind of master/slave relationship (which is just as sexist as the first assumption), modern household usually don't work like that: husband comes home: ""wife make me a san...muffins for work"" and than go and watch tv while the wife prepares (not saying there are no such relations, but it is wrong to assume all of them are). You could have simply said ""sorry I am bad at baking"" or ""Sorry did not have time"" and that would be fine, but not going all out like that. This obviously does not apply if there was some escalation of arguments before, but you did not mention that.

gaming,fdmvydj,t1_fdlidks,1578568336.0,"Actually that's not even that much of a deal.

(remember how everyone expected, that the new AAA games released in say 97-98,  to run  well on a 91-92 hardware? Yeah me neither)  


  It is also not just the hardware, with better resolution and shading you get more into the uncanny valley, meaning animation issues are more apparent,  textures (even with the help of procedurally generated) issues are more apparent, subpixel issues etc...

Exactly! And being atheist just means you do not believe in any religion, that's it. 

But it's worth mentioning that at least here there are many atheist that were once religious, which usually means that they had some strong feelings against relegion that made them reconsider their faith. So the negativity toward religion on this subredit is understandable. But it does not apply to all atheists. 

Although one thing that I think many atheists have in common is that we agree religion should be kept out of politics and education
