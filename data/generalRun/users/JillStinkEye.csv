technology,ffd9o9u,t1_ffd6lco,1579816164.0,I've heard of places that charged for every type of payment in a different way. It's a total scam.
ATBGE,ffcxmt4,t1_ffcu0c5,1579809398.0,I greatly appreciate your dedication! I had no idea there was a historical precedent for this usage.
ATBGE,ffcvz4x,t1_ffcu7bb,1579808408.0,"I agree that having the ability to communicate in a professional fashion is very important. However I also understand that casual conversation can be very different and is more often used on the internet. Although I guarantee that there are more progressive regions and professions that use this kind of slang regularly. 

TBH I used to be just like this. Of course my mom had a lot to do with it. Over the years I've become much less judgemental over language. I've realized how much language is dependant on socio-economic factors. It's not about intelligence or defiance. People speak the way they were spoken to. Obviously this acceptance doesn't help them in professional settings, but acceptance doesn't preclude education. 

The other thing that has changed my outlook is the history of language evolution. We often talk about how Shakespeare created an impressive amount of words. How would that go over today? Will woot or yeet be added to our esteemed lexicon? Probably not, but there are plenty of useful words added to dictionaries each year. Since this change is inevitable I've decided to embrace it. It can be really freeing to allow yourself to play with language. I detested the verbing of nouns at first. But I realized that they can sometimes relay more information in less words. I'm going antiquing vs I'm going to shop for antiques. It sounds strange, but it works. I'd rather allow strange to become normal than stand firmly as the world moves on.

I discussed it with her before asking for a sentence so I don't think it would be a helpful exercise. Also, my 70yr old mother who reads a physical paper and watches the weather channel isn't exactly in touch with the times. No shade. (I'm not offhandedly insulting her.) There's nothing wrong with how my mom lives her life. It's just not exactly modern."
ATBGE,ffctl7v,t1_ffcpd0m,1579806990.0,"> I would still argue that Definition 3 ""of or resembling an aesthete"" wouldn't apply to our boy in blue that started this whole thing, because that guy certainly does not appear to be someone who ""has an appreciation of art and beauty.""

Really? Why do you think they decorated themselves in this way? Why do you think SO MANY people are defending their look? 


I don't agree that definition 4 is dependant on anyone's opinion of this look.


> Of a thing: in accordance with principles of artistic beauty or taste; giving or designed to give pleasure through beauty; of pleasing appearance.

While I believe the look is in accordance of the principles of artistic beauty, there's really no question that the look was designed to give pleasure through beauty. Full stop."
ATBGE,ffcsm6u,t1_ffcpldr,1579806422.0,"Ironically I was just chatting with her about this to try to determine the correct terminology to discuss the different uses. Her response about the whole thing was, ""The way people use and misuse words, I can't imagine why someone would get THAT upset about it."" 

Here's the thing. You are fighting a losing fight. Is my usage one that was previously, or, after reading others research, recently common or ""accepted"" by proper grammar? No. Why does that matter? It's very commonly used this way. It's perfectly understandable this way. It's likely to continue to be used this way in the future. Language changes. People go antiquing now. Things that are awful are bad rather than inspiring awe. There's no point in kicking against the picks. Changing language only loses meaning if you fail to keep up with the changes. It's changing whether you like it or not."
ATBGE,ffcnt0k,t1_ffboaq3,1579803405.0,"They are right in a sense. Even as an adjective, aesthetic isn't traditionally used by itself. However, it does make logical sense, and has evolved to be used this way."
ATBGE,ffck0f4,t1_ffbykqa,1579801096.0,My husband is living for vapaorwave. It's like the 80s if I had done ecstasy and watched Max Headroom as a child.
HomeImprovement,ffcixej,t1_ffb4mkl,1579800443.0,Thanks!! You've not only helped with this problem but given me a better understanding of my hvac system. I wish you well!
ATBGE,ffcinsh,t1_ffbvpsm,1579800281.0,"Actually I think you'll find these are two spellings of the same word. Both are valid but aesthetic is more common, although often in the US we use the e for esthetician. While my usage isn't strictly traditional, it's been common for the past few years."
