SandersForPresident,ffltur4,t1_ffivt0o,1580044126.0,The US won't change because 50% of our population is brain damaged and they vote for people that put their boots on their throats and they ask for more.
videos,fflkg2i,t1_ffj1v0k,1580040742.0,That's because 99.9% of streamers have no real education or trade so twitch is all they got. Never thought e-begging would be such a huge thing for so many people.

gamingpc,ffk6r9f,t3_etzdae,1580017714.0,This is the best way to build a soft tubing system imo. Looks clean and has that industrial vibe. I almost went with this over petg initially.
PS4,ffk3mi9,t3_etob19,1580014783.0,Damn Xbox one is a colossal failure. I'm surprised MS wants to continue that division. They would be better served  diverting their resources towards PC and mobile gaming by buying up game studios and making a real alternative to Steam -- not their crappy Windows store.

watercooling,ffavwkf,t3_esegt5,1579745714.0,Looks pretty good! Personally not a fan of corsair watercooling equipment (esp gpu blocks) but the bends look good. That's one gigantic case.
watercooling,ff8wak7,t3_esafcj,1579698209.0,Not bad but I think it would have looked better without all those 45/90 degree fittings cluttering up the insides and adding a lot more points of failure. Why didn't you bend the petg?
