college,ff41qh1,t1_ff370if,1579553643.0,">If you have any questions, message me or comment. Regardless of my faults, you can learn a lot from me. I’m very expressive, and I’ve put a lot of thought into existence. I feel that I’ve all but mastered this stage of my life; I can help you do the same. It isn’t about relentless self-improvement or cultish productivity, it is about something that can never be put into words. Regardless of what anybody thinks about me after this post, my life is filled with love and joy- not only for me either, I share it with those who engage with me. Reward yourself my friend, I’m trying to make it easy for you.

How has your college experience been? I loved reading this.

I also believe that at the end of it all, life's about sharing something, connection- when you think about it, it's like everything we're doing is just to be loved a little more. Be it accumulating wealth or looking for relationships.

I've just started college, and I was so inspired going in to it because it finally meant independence. I performed well in high school but at the expense of genuinely connecting with people- but not in the sense that I holed up in my room studying all day. I was a leader in varsity sports and service clubs, was an avid film student, had a high GPA, but I could never be authentic genuine with people. When I moved abroad for college, this translated to being extremely quiet, constantly making judgements about other people's character and motivations, and overall retracting any exhibition of personality. I got a job at a pizza shop over winter break to keep myself busy, and perhaps offer a new social environment to start over, but in a few week's time I resorted back to introspection and (I've never been diagnosed, but I think) some aspects of depression.

My problem is I'm fully aware of my problems and what I need to do to fix them; think less, judge less, care 'for' rather than 'about' others, because academics has never been a major challenge for me. I think this is what's called the 'knowledge-action gap'. It's like a vicious cycle of, once I spend enough time with self-help podcasts & videos, talking to a close friend or family, and acquire a newfound self-compassion- I'll go out in the new world and find out people still look at me the same and get deflated. I know change starts with myself and it starts with persistence, but I still fall at this 'knowledge-action gap'. Will I ever get over this? What are your thoughts on what I can do? It feels like I've already tried everything.."
college,ff3zguo,t1_ff2ahao,1579552233.0,Same fr. Do you think you might do it after first year?
college,fds3z2c,t3_emw1xc,1578693899.0,Definitely feel that. I feel like I could've accomplished so much more if I didn't spend the break being blue haha. Kinda wishing I could go back in time that way. But it was alright really. What are the majors you're switching in?
