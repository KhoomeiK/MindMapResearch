britpics,ffn0wvz,t1_ffh70ux,1580060850.0,"> What kind of volume do they deal with when paying 10p each? It must be fairly large or it wouldn't be worth their while, surely?

I couldn't say for sure, but it'd be thousands a week. The fact they can buy them on the feather for 10p ea, and sell them dressed to supermarkets for £1-2 (or probably double that if they're selling direct) is precisely *why* it's worth their while.

> I was under the impression that game was very small-scale, and that it was sourced from a small number of private estates and that's why it attracted a premium price tag in the supermarkets or farm shops.

It's fairly small scale when compared to the rest of the meat industry ""small number of private estates"" is a bit of an underestimation though. 

It's estimated there are close to 10,000 shoots in the UK, releasing 20-30 million birds each year. Most shoots reckon they average a 30-40% return on what they release, so even allowing for some birds to not be edible (dog damage, poorly shot, etc) that's still millions entering the food chain each year ....much  of which is exported to the continent where game meat is much more in demand.

Sounds a lot, but compared to the 1 billion plus broilers bred & slaughtered in the UK annually it's barely a drop in the ocean.

---

Best way to get free game is probably help out on a shoot. All our beaters & pickers-up get to take a brace or two home after each outing. As do the guns.

You don't necessarily have to help out on the actual shoot days if you don't think that's for you. Maybe you could offer to breast out & package a bunch of birds for them to give out to their guns, guests & helpers and you get to keep any remainder.

So yeah, there are enough shoots about that there are probably several nearby you could approach.

---

As for rabbits and the like.... If you got yourself a half decent air rifle and went around asking a few farmers if they have any rabbit problems that need handling I'm sure you'd eventually find a good source.

Personally I have a couple of cooking apple trees that produce way more apples than I could possibly handle. I used to pick them up off the lawn & bin them, then tried local food banks ...who weren't interested in anything not in a packet or a ready-meal. Nowadays I leave them on the floor for the rabbits, then cull the rabbits once a year when there are no apples left for them to eat.

Keeps the local rabbit population at a sensible level that they don't get wiped out by Myxy and other diseases, and fills my meat freezer up with free organic apple-fed rabbit meat once a year. Win-win!"

britpics,fffu23x,t1_fffsh30,1579891799.0,"...a 'brace' is for *two*! (10p each).

One of the main reasons for this is because huge commercial shoots have sprung up all over the place in the last few decades, primarily to cater for rich city corporate types who want to shoot big numbers but aren't interested in taking home what they shoot.

Those shoots make their money selling days to these sorts of folks, not from the game entering the food-chain (to them the game is pretty much a by-product).

In fairness I can kinda see why they do it. The day to day costs of putting on a commercial shoot day are the same whether the bag you're aiming for is 100 birds or 400. Your wage bill, catering bill etc. is exactly the same so it's easy to see why they'd rather attract clients who want big bag days.

---

The end result of this is a massive glut of game that floods the market come the shooting season. Supermarkets still see game as a 'premium product' for a niche audience so are reluctant to reduce prices, causing demand to be way lower than supply. Hence the low 'wholesale' prices.

Means that the game dealers & supermarkets are making a tidy profit, and the big shoots aren't really bothered as it's not really where they make their money anyway.

It doesn't really affect us either as we tend to eat what we shoot. If we ever shoot more than we need they get donated to a local pub in exchange for a few pints."

A drop test may accelerate the object at 1G on the way down, but can be massively more when the object decelerates to a stop as it hits the ground (think of how quickly and over the tiny distances an object comes to a complete stop when it hits the ground compared to the comparatively large distance it took to get up to that speed under 1G while falling). 

eg. A mobile phone can experience an instantaneous deceleration force of 1000-2000G when it hits a hard floor from waist height.

A drop test isn't measuring the ability to withstand acceleration on the way down (1G), but the deceleration as it comes to a stop, which can be 100s or 1000s of Gs.
