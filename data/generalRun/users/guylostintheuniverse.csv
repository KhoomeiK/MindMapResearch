What's annoying here is your mum hid this from you. Sit down with her and tell her, look Mum, I understand cars get scratched but I was more annoyed that you hid this from me instead of telling me right away. I don't understand why you can't trust me. Because of that I'm not letting you drive my car anymore."

Him being cold is a way to ignore you so he can squash and remove any feelings he has. It's a very common technique. 

I would try to stop this dead in its tracks as soon as possible before he gets rid of his feelings. Get him one on one and talk about it face to face. If he can't handle the discussion then it's clear he isn't mature enough."

If you don't feel the spark then just tell him you want to spice it up. No need to jump ship and change so suddenly. 

If you can't do that then it's different.

Likely A was just asking to see if there's any information or gossip, or maybe A and C are good enough friends that A may tell C when you are not around.

Either way you are fully right to not involve anyone else in your business. At the same time though it's very hard to say what As motive was and whether or not she told C. 

As I am someone who plays it safe, I would assume A told C about this enconter since you he was cold to you. I would take this and tell him you have a crush on him and ask for a date when you are next alone at work.

That way you can clear this stress from your mind."

Advice,fggswrj,t3_eycxqg,1580768832.0,"You may live your life as you see fit, dont worry about that. From what I have read, your brain seems to be saboutaging this great relationship you have. Why? Because your past have been so very different. This person seems too good to be true, so your brain seems to want to get a way out since it is not used to this kind of behaviour. Thats why you think you have a lower standard. 

He hasnt said anything to you, hasnt judged you, so then why  worry? Why worry about something that isnt real? 

Best thing to do would be to sit him down and honestly speak to him. Just tell him the truth about how you are feeling inferior etc. Then he can respond and you will have an answer.

For the sex bit, also speak to him about that too. Maybe he is just paranoid/insecure about having sex so does not want to do it yet."

I'm sorry but what? So you literally want him to pay you for milage too? I'm sorry but i find that to be extremely greedy, gas+insurance of course he should pay half, but per mile, um no. Now for the car payments, if it was under his name and he joint-owned the car then yes, but he doesn't so I would not. If he does, and god forbid you broke up, then I expect you have to pay him back his share of the car. If something breaks, then yes you should both chip-in and fix it. 

He should really try fixing his car so he can use it, since you are worried  about milage so much. Why not just take a train or bus? That way you dont have to worry about anything?
