Life isn't black and white, and your pompous remark of ""LOL just don't be afraid of failure, duh!"" proves how dismissive everybody in this society is about mental health.

I'm not saying go to a movie theater and whip your dick out obviously, but saying people are dumb for experiencing a natural emotion in a movie is just kinda weird.

Who are you to say I can't feel that way?  Movies try to get *all sorts* of emotions out of people.  I'm assuming you wouldn't think it's weird if someone gets angry when watching a war movie, for example.  Or experiencing happiness when watching a comedy.

> But for me (and a lot of people in this thread), in their current state, sex scenes aren't progressing a characters relationships in our minds and are distracting from the plot of the movie.

This I think is a much fairer argument than your original one, even if it's generalizing the entire industry.

I do think it's odd people are much less willing to overlook bad writing when it comes to sex scenes vs bad writing when it comes to other things, but ultimately the issue is bad writing / acting and not the sex itself as I understand it.

Nah, I know you call people who enjoy that ""dumb and barbaric who just want to get their dick/cunts hard/wet,"" which isn't even true in a lot of cases, but even if it was it's not a bad thing to want to be sexually excited.  As I said, it's natural human nature.

That is clear enough evidence for me to say you have an unnecessarily poor view / fear of sex, which is likely deeply rooted in your subconscious since you refuse to admit that view is even an issue.

>But explain how, using this example again, watching two people dry hump is used for great story telling.

Sex, as you say, is an extremely intimate act.  By showing two people having sex, you're solidifying their relationship as growing more intimate.

It is great for storytelling in the same way watching two people go on a date and flirt with each other is great for storytelling.  It's about building a relationship with two people, and making it increasingly/believably intimate.  Since sex is a big part of people's relationships, it's perfectly acceptable to show it alongside all the other aspects of normal relationships."

I highly disagree.  If it makes you feel any better, it's cultural to fear sex so don't feel too bad.

>And not enjoying watching people fuck or pretend fuck with my parents doesn't mean I think sex is the boogie-man. It means I think it's an intimate act that evokes a feeling that you can share with certain people, and not others

You only think this way because you think of sex as some extremely taboo thing.  You, of course, have no problem watching people kiss even though it can be just as intimate.

It's a shame you refuse to view sex as a natural thing that can be used in great storytelling, but luckily for me (and not for the people in this thread) it's not going anywhere in movies/tv shows.

Cheers."

It's not that OP is disappointed in his choices, just that his *college* self would be because he's operating under a completely different mindset."

You don't have to want to cum every time you watch sex.  Porn has ruined your view of sex, clearly.

>Because if you're comfortable with that, you're the one who's disconnected from reality.

Nope, still you (and the people of this thread).  Sex isn't the boogie man, and hopefully you can overcome your deep-rooted fear of it someday."

Being alone on a special day when all your other days are also spent alone is not so great.

At least in my experience."
