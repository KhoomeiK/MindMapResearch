leagueoflegends,ffbayov,t1_ffb8i33,1579757982.0,I offered a while ago that they should just make all of his guns have very strikingly different (and obvious) color schemes. Maybe even make the off-hand visible with a color identifier. It'd at least be a start.
leagueoflegends,ffbatlq,t1_ffb72im,1579757828.0,"Singed also NEEDS to be on top of you to do anything, and long cooldowns excepting his Q. His entire kit is basically ""run fast, get a squishy with Fling, then run around the enemies and generally be chaotic."" Range is a massive variable in League, obviously. It defines top lane for example. And Singed is incredibly vulnerable to hard CC, since like I said, he NEEDS to be on top of you to be relevant.

Aphelios can auto you from base. That's obviously an extreme example, but it's true. On top of that, there's not a single combo of his that's not good. Riot wanted a high-skill cap champion, but made a champion that's essentially smash the keyboard and kite like a regular adc. They gave him high numbers because they (somehow) thought he'd be hard to play optimally. If you take away the high numbers, he'll still have his on-demand autos into a root, etc. People will just start to play him tank or some shit.

leagueoflegends,ffaytwz,t1_ffay2rj,1579747653.0,"Yes, that's my point. He's so unidentifiable. Any of his combos have different strategies attached, but I can't know what he has until it's arguably too late."
