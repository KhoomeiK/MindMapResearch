I calculated with an added tablespoon of oil for the dinner veggies to be roasted in and two tablespoons of peanut butter with the apple for a snack. It’s great in terms of calories(my calculation was 1543 but depends on what brand and size of stuff ya buy) but there should probably be a tad more protein and a bit less fat, because the daily percentage is 45% of calories are from carbs, 18% protein, and 37% fat. You should be eating between 45-60% carbs, so you’re right on track there, 10-35% protein, and 20-35% fat. Many people say they feel better satiated with more protein in their diet, so I would add more protein and cut down a bit from fat, but all and all, this looks like a good day of food!

unpopularopinion,fevws3r,t3_eqh2c2,1579402437.0,"I was recently diagnosed with bipolar II disorder at 17, senior year of high school. I’m 18 now and in college, but I had soooo many signs when I was younger. I’m pretty sure I began having depressive episodes(not as bad as they got when I was older before diagnoses and medication) in 6th grade. When my episodes first came up, I would nap a lot more than usual, and my homework took a huge hit. Since the sixth grade I have had a depressive episode every year usually getting it’s worse mid to late winter, and went from being about a month when I was younger up  to my longest episode last year at about four months, far more symptoms and intensity as it fully presented itself. Everyone just wrote off me not doing my homework as me trying to be a bad student, and my therapist was so biased against bipolar disorder that she never saw any of the signs and didn’t let me get a diagnosis until I had to go to the crisis center because of it, leading me to work with other professionals who gave me a diagnosis and medication. Luckily, now after taking medication for a full year(the medications can take months to fully take effect) my grades are the best they have ever been, I got onto the Deans List of my college in my first semester with my lowest grade in 7 classes being an A-, and even though it is the dead of winter I have absolutely no signs of another depressive episode at the moment! What upsets me is that if people took my mental health seriously and looked beyond just middle school emotions, I could have gotten a diagnosis years before, but instead I (and my grades) had to suffer for years until it landed me in the crisis center, for Gods sake. It is really important to listen and really look into mental health when things look off. We need to take care of our children, especially at that age. Luckily I ended up okay, but if my medication provider hadn’t had just a sliver of curiosity, I could have been gone by now, and that makes me kind of sad to think of. This was huuuuuge, don’t blame anyone for not reading, lol. More of a rant. My bad!"

I’ll say it publicly here on this comment thread, what I mentioned in the DM was that maybe the miscommunication was because when I said I was a democrat, it was because I wanted to show that even though we share political parties, I don’t always agree with everything they do just because we are in the same party.
