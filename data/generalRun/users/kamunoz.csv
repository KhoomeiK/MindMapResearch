X4Foundations,fgtqekx,t1_fgtpwpa,1581108050.0,"I might try again - but half the reason I liked it was that it had a story! It wasn’t a great story, but it was pleasing."
X4Foundations,fgtmipm,t1_fgtln9o,1581106469.0,"I didn’t get that far, unfortunately. I literally couldn’t find my way around even the first few sectors, so doing anything was incredibly tedious for me. I don’t fault the game for this at all, I’m just incapable of holding a mental map in my head, so I was always having to check the game map, and then there was all that spaghetti, and I couldn’t grok any of it."
spacesimgames,fgtlt5y,t1_fgsbujs,1581106280.0,"I would have become a big fan of the game for all of its features, if it weren’t for the art style. I think the art style is an interesting choice and I don’t dislike it simply because it’s cartoony. I abhor it because it‘s almost impossible to track what’s happening on screen since the usual visual cues are absent. Lack of shading in the colors means everything is always RIGHT THERE, so distance is really hard to gauge, and when there is a lot of stuff on screen it all just looks like a jumble brightly colored triangles.

Then there’s the fact that despite the cockpit view the joystick controls are atrocious. The game really wants you to play KB+M. I hate KB+M for any game where I’m in a cockpit.

In other words, great game idea, unfortunate execution."
X4Foundations,fgtled1,t3_f0etks,1581106044.0,"For me, X Rebirth was almost great. The only thing I didn’t like about it was the spaghetti bowl of highways, which pushed directly on my personal blind spot, which is an absolutely shit sense of direction and mental mapping. I could not for the life of me figure out where anything was. I gave up on Rebirth for only that reason. Otherwise, it seemed like it was a lot of fun."

gurps,fgrtaqy,t1_fgrt7b7,1581056796.0,Honestly I think the biggest GURPS-related mistake SJG ever made was backing out of the Fallout agreement.
gurps,fgrswro,t1_fgrsdf3,1581056409.0,"They don’t have the money for any of those properties. The best they’ve been able to do recently were Discworld (a failure) and Mars Attacks (another failure).

SJG doesn’t have the license to any of the old settings they created for 3E. They could theoretically do *some* of Cthulhu, as parts of that corpus are in the public domain, but that property is already so saturated and attached to existing systems that are much more well known, I doubt they’d get much traction.

(Regarding your final examples: no one in their right mind would license WoD or Shadowrun right now, since both have active first-party RPGs, and Shadowrun 6th edition is less than a year old.)"
gurps,fgrrqbe,t1_fgrri17,1581055269.0,"Douglas Cole kickstarted the Nordlond setting for DFRPG. It’s doing decently well. Much lower response rate than for DFRPG itself, though."

gurps,fgr3e7m,t1_fgr2vaj,1581037244.0,"Sure there are. Last year I started a new gaming group with 5 other players, none of whom had played GURPS before. But for every 2 of yours or 5 of mine there are many more who are leaving GURPS behind, and very many more who are getting exposed to D&D and storytelling-heavy games.

SJG does almost no marketing for GURPS - they don’t have the budget. There were a few convention games run back when DFRPG first came out, but since then, it’s ad hoc and piecemeal. They rely on word of mouth from players, but there aren’t enough of us left to do anything but keep treading water.

I don’t see any positive path forward for GURPS. It will linger, but it will never thrive again."
gurps,fgqrc9g,t1_fgq38h2,1581029836.0,"Historically, GURPS adventures don’t sell well at all.

The system appeals to people who like toolkits and enjoy making their own campaign worlds. It does not appeal nearly as much to people who want pre-made adventures.

The time for GURPS is past. As a system it is still very much a product of the 1990s simulationist RPG philosophy. No one lives on that island anymore."
gurps,fgqqzm0,t3_ezx040,1581029631.0,"GURPS is a system very heavily entrenched in the 1990s. It reached its peak in third edition back when rules-heavy RPGs were common. By the time 4th edition rolled around, things were changing in the industry, and storytelling-focused games were getting bigger.

I love GURPS. It’s the only system I play. I have all of the books (print and PDF) for 4th edition and a good chunk of the ones for 3rd.

But as a viable RPG, its time is long past.

This isn’t just down to the D&D juggernaut, either. Other systems are thriving (like Apocalypse World and Dungeon World) or at least holding steady. But they are all products of the storytelling push, which is less concerned with realism and precision rules. And the player base has followed that trend. The big growth in board games has taken some of the air out of the balloon for rules-heavy RPGs, punctured on both ends: on the one hand, rules-heavy board games are popular but don’t require weeks and months of time to play; and on the other, rules-light board games are popular and make people wonder why they’re wasting all their time fiddling with stats in an RPG.

GURPS could be simplified, after a fashion, but it would take more than just paring down the rule set to approximately GURPS Lite levels. The entire philosophy of GURPS is simulationist, and that ship has sailed.

GURPS will linger on for a while longer. Since Steve Jackson is sole owner he can choose to continue the line for as long as he likes; he doesn’t answer to anyone. But if (read: when) that changes, expect GURPS to go away."
tifu,fgqbdkt,t1_fgpo5f6,1581021200.0,"Yup! I was allergic to walnuts for the longest time, in precisely that way, because I had pollen allergies growing up. Most of those allergies have gone away so I can eat walnuts now - but it took me years before I realized it!

I was also allergic to tomatoes (same result) and lobster (made my mouth itch). I can eat tomatoes again and I’ve been a vegetarian since I was 14 so lobster of course has not been an issue for 32 years."

patientgamers,ffyldlg,t1_ffxgc0f,1580349191.0,"It’s really hard to do an RPG plus combat and movement in the way that I suspect you mean. RPGs traditionally handle character skill as stats and don’t rely on the player’s twitch fingers. The subgenre of “ARPG” moves in that direction but even there the RPG elements have to exist enough so it’s not just effectively a third-person shooter.

It’s like the difference between a sports management sim (like Football Manager) and a sports playing sim (like PES). Combining them effectively is really, really hard, because the more you lean in one direction the more you lose the other, and staying dead center in the middle means that both sides will probably suck."

books,fffvi82,t1_ffeql6s,1579892702.0,"I think what’s happening in many cases is that straight, white male readers haven’t been noticing political themes because those themes were vaguely in line with their own thinking, or could be perceived (by them) as straw man arguments for opposing views, which makes them easier to hide under the entertainment.

But with the broadening of the creative pool for published science fiction and fantasy, there are a lot of ideas and themes floating around that straight, white male readers either don’t recognize or actively find repulsive in ways that they cannot easily ignore.

So they believe, therefore, that modern genre fiction is more political than it used to be. It’s not entirely because they don’t like the politics, it’s because they didn’t recognize past works *as* politics.

X4Foundations,ffcisu1,t1_ffci6nx,1579800367.0,"X4 has that, too, at least in principle. (The extent to which it’s buggy is a contentious discussion, of course.)

Though strictly speaking WoW and Runescape and all the others that had “dynamic economies” don’t really have *realistic* economies. The way those game work, there have to be unlimited goods available in order for each player to have the same experience, which means that there’s an external source of materials that cannot be manipulated by any means. Even the rare items are infinite in their quantity, even if their availability is constrained. And if those items, or any items, are artificially constrained by non-market forces (i.e., the developers), then you still have an unrealistic set of conditions.

X4’s version of this is the infinite availability of asteroid/gas mining products. (The infinite availability of solar energy models the real world closely enough as to be indistinguishable, since the game isn’t played on galactic time scales.)

Most market manipulation in MMOs is really a form of inflation manipulation more than anything else. Supply constraint is largely outside of player control, and demand is directly proportional to population size (though affected by the game meta to some degree as well). In a realistic economy, demand can be manipulated by marketing and other mercantile means. That’s not really the case in a game, where demand is tied to game mechanics, which is outside player control."
