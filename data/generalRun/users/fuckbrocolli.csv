nba,ffa9ok8,t1_ff9m4vr,1579730608.0,As a Sixers fan I agree with you 100%. Our sub acts like he has value when he’s literally proven nothing on the court.

actuary,fenblrp,t3_eq2dcc,1579281196.0,Cyber is one of the hottest markets out there right now and any experience in it would be very valuable. Having a non math major won’t hurt you at all. If you show that you can pass 2-3 exams you will have no problem getting an actuarial offer.
sixers,fenba9y,t1_fenag69,1579280999.0,Bro we didn’t even play the Celtics last year in the playoffs
actuary,fek3ws4,t3_epbjp7,1579192075.0,5 years from now no one will give a shit if you skipped study days during rush season. A lot of people will give a shit about how many exams you passed though.

actuary,fehc8tw,t3_ep52nj,1579113582.0,Stay at your current job. If you really only have 1 hour to spare each day then it should be spent on applying to insurance positions rather than studying some programming language you may or may not need.
MMA,fehbsgv,t3_eonle0,1579113313.0,"I don't understand all the people saying Cowboy should wrestle. It might be his best chance at winning, but I really don't think winning is his main goal here. The goal for Cowboy is to put on a great fight. If he wrestles Conor for 5 rounds fans are going to be pissed. I honestly think Cowboy would rather lose a brawl than win a sleeper, and that's why fans love him."

actuary,fcu66rg,t1_fcte47b,1577973516.0,It's useless because P&C companies expect you to pursue your FCAS. GI is the only track I'd consider to be useless.
college,fct85xc,t3_eiqjck,1577935423.0,"Definitely in your head. Professors write these types of letters all the time so I don't think a month is too little, although I'd probably just email her now tbh."

college,fcn4m4z,t1_fclvnou,1577803124.0,"First, it sounds like the grade will be in within 2-3 weeks. I doubt he's giving your classmates months to redo their assignments. Second, I'm sure you're already registered for your classes next semester, so again why are you making a big deal out of this?"
actuary,fcn2p3x,t3_ehp98r,1577801592.0,There’s no point in putting your major gpa if your overall gpa is 3.9....
college,fcl2ffb,t3_ehp693,1577738341.0,I don't see what the big deal is. It's obvious that you did well on the assignment and will get a good grade eventually. Maybe he is waiting for all the other assignments to come in before figuring out a curve (which could potentially bump your grade up).
