TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ffcm8p1,t1_ffck41k,1579802440.0,I misread that as girl poop. I'm not even sure what kind of joke I can make from that.
manga,ffc26r8,t1_ffbm3pn,1579789672.0,This kind of fluffy chapters make me feel like how I do when I first have a crush on someone. It's great.
blackmagicfuckery,ffc0xbm,t1_ffbt479,1579788720.0,I've seen this quote atleast 3 times on reddit just today alone. It really is a hivemind.
anime,ffaju8p,t1_ffaby36,1579737522.0,"I mean, ~~most~~ all of those preferences sound like something even non weeb guys would find attractive."
NetflixSexEducation,ffaf65l,t1_ff9dhav,1579734289.0,"I'm the same dude, I came here to see some discussion about Jackson's family or Aimee story or literally ANYTHING else. But its all just Otis and Maeve or hating on Isaac. I guess that's what I get for getting into a show about teenagers."
NetflixSexEducation,ffaes4a,t1_feolldo,1579733987.0,It would be more realistic if Maeve just never checked her voicemail cause honestly who even uses voicemail anymore other than old people and businesses.
AskReddit,ff8tb5n,t1_ff8h93q,1579695297.0,"People on reddit are so hypocritical. First they talk about it's unfair that making fun of penis size is normal, but in the next thread they do it themselves. I bet its all guys making these jokes too. Stand up for your fellow men fgs!!"
Whatcouldgowrong,ff6n7c1,t1_ff6krv4,1579630783.0,"I mean, he might be kashmiri. Then I feel being ""butt hurt"" might be valid."
Whatcouldgowrong,ff6mv04,t1_ff6j53g,1579630577.0,I bet some of them were wearing short sleeved t-shirts too. I mean if you're gonna flex your biceps like that then you're basically asking for it at that point smh.

AskReddit,ff5vw4o,t1_ff5t976,1579612030.0,"It's weird but for me it was the opposite. At 13, I hated the idea of having boobs. It took me a while to get comfortable with them."
AskReddit,ff5vrkh,t1_ff5scdi,1579611914.0,I mean there is a middle ground between itty bitty titties and giant badonkadonks. Mine are pretty average in size and I don't get back aches but can still get a cleavage if need be (though I'm not a huge fan of low cut tops).
dataisbeautiful,ff3mpv6,t1_ff3ah6t,1579544349.0,I mean she might be sitting alone at the time. I normally text people the most when I'm not actually with anyone IRL at the moment.
dataisbeautiful,ff3mloa,t1_ff3b6zl,1579544277.0,"Lol this described my boyfriend too well. Almost all his replies are some variation of ""ahh yeh""."

smashbros,fejut3c,t1_fejrhn0,1579186347.0,I don't think even many fire emblem fans wanted byleth tbh. Byleth is one of the less interesting parts of FE3H.
smashbros,fejukum,t1_fejtwsv,1579186195.0,I can't complain. I'm weeb trash.
smashbros,fejttc8,t1_fejrlb9,1579185692.0,"I guess the problem there would be picking which one of the three. I wouldn't mind though, they're all better than byleth."
smashbros,fejt8jp,t1_fejsyqj,1579185283.0,Yeah you aren't wrong there.
smashbros,fejsspv,t1_fejs7f4,1579184972.0,I mean the character doesn't seem to play anything like marth but okay.
worldnews,fedkmod,t1_fed4it5,1579013882.0,"Wow, they literally killed kids for being the wrong type of Muslim. This country is nuts."
actuallesbians,feczq32,t1_febwvfb,1578991475.0,Yeah I've watched it and I loved it! I just couldn't think of which character could've been her love interest cause the only other important female characters were either related to her or that old northundra lady.
femalefashionadvice,febs7ci,t1_fe9u593,1578962085.0,"I feel you girl. I'd be happy to gain weight ANYWHERE else. Butt, boobs, thighs idk. Why my stomach though. :'("
femalefashionadvice,februg4,t1_feae2wp,1578961928.0,This is a stereotype I haven't heard of before. Is there any reason it exists? I cuff my trousers because I think it looks cute.

actuallesbians,febm4r7,t1_fe9jlv3,1578960254.0,Can I ask what the non-romantic aspect of this is?
actuallesbians,febltow,t1_fe93af1,1578960134.0,I'm a straight woman who finds girls aesthetically attractive. Why are girls so dang PRETTY?? UGH
actuallesbians,febl0oe,t1_fe9lugx,1578959941.0,Who was the new character? Samantha?
AskReddit,fe9rck7,t1_fe6ez9d,1578940835.0,This is the stuff of nightmares.
