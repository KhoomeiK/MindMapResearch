They usually use a litany of methods to avoid cops, but 90% are just self reported speed traps and the like. Although iirc Alex Roy had a spotter plane flying overhead to spot cop cars at one point"

Russia ran a disinformation campaign to get a president elected who would repay them with removing sanctions once in power. Which happened. To be completely ignorant of that is just... ridiculous."
agedlikemilk,fejy774,t1_fejxit7,1579188545.0,"First off, yes, I believe Russia influenced the election more than any other country combined.

The others, they're american companies pushing american politics. It's the exact same thing as the NRA or the conservative CEOs who came out to support trump. It's not great to let corporations have as much power as they do in the current system; but its fucked up regardless of whether the corporate influence is in favor of the R or D."

Massdrop,fcnd1gb,t1_fcn7th1,1577809102.0,It's probably just pending. My guess is it will take a few business days to drop off.
