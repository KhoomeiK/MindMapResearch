EatCheapAndHealthy,ff7ai3l,t1_ff698m5,1579644654.0,"I second the food bank option. That's exactly what they are there for, to help feed people that need food. I've volunteered at a few and (at least the ones I've worked at) they don't really ask too many questions on whether you 'need' the help or not. The food they give out might be short dated or odd, but not always.

Like others have mentioned, if you still feel bad about going to one, give back at a time when you can. Volunteer to help at them or give food or other needed supplies. You can always call and say you want to help and ask what they actually need too, so that you don't end up donating the same thing that they just got a pallet full of or show up to volunteer on a day that there are already a whole host of people.

Another point about food banks and soup kitchens, if you go volunteer, many will feed the volunteers before they open to serve the needy. Then you can feel good about volunteering and get some food as well."

AskReddit,fdt61ml,t1_fdt3z19,1578712384.0,"I’m hoping it gets better soon lol. Hasn’t been easy working full time and doing school full time. I was unemployed for a while between electrician and school, about a year unemployed and 4 months(ish) doing minimum wage in a factory overnights. That’s the job that made me say ‘I have to turn this shit around’. Coming home bruised and cut up smelling like burnt plastic and being dead tired really takes a toll on you and makes you rethink your life choices. That job was filled with people who literally couldn’t get a job somewhere else(convicts and other things most people don’t want to hire, but still good people). And there I was a mid 20’s lad with decent work history and no criminal record. I got asked ‘why are you working here?’ a lot.

I can’t complain about life though, I have a great wife, working cars, and fulfilling hobbies. Money is tight, but we make it work."
AskReddit,fdrwymd,t1_fdrv9kd,1578690938.0,"Just remember it’s never too late to learn something new if what you do now starts to get old or painful(I know carpenters put up with a lot of shit). If you go back to college, older students tend to get along better with instructors. Sit up front, don’t be afraid to talk or answer questions. Just remember that you are paying for it so you should put a lot of effort into it."
AskReddit,fdrutu3,t1_fdrm093,1578690137.0,"Tools are one of those things that it can be worth spending a bit more on to get a good brand vs el cheapo tools. Good tools allow you to focus on the work instead of fighting. For small home projects, good tools will last a lifetime."
AskReddit,fdrua2g,t1_fdrjui4,1578689811.0,"Long story semi short: it was about 2013, recession was still a thing in rural IL, although it was starting to get better. That combined with not working for a great company. I worked in a factory for a while and did odd jobs before I decided to go back to school and get my degree before having kids. I’m not much older than my college peers, I’m not 30 yet, but a few good years of life experience has left me with a broader life view than most college students. 

Short version, not great company for work/life balance and recession. 

I liked the work, I enjoy working with my hands. But I know is rather sit in an office doing taxes or bean counting and leave that kind of work for hobbies. I have the upmost respect for the trades, it just didn’t work out for me at that time in my life. I learned a lot as a tradesman and it helped me grow as a person. Overall 8/10"

todayilearned,fdr7hho,t1_fdr3ae2,1578680595.0,I know IL doesn’t require the coroner to be a medical doctor. It’s an administrative position. I would imagine some of the other states are the same.
AskReddit,fdqw7hf,t1_fdquiy1,1578675682.0,"Not much danger of that now. I hung up the tool belt years ago and only do work on my own home or close family. I'm about 5 months away from a bachelors in Accounting, so I don't think I will need to put my electricians tools through hard use or above ceilings any time soon."
AskReddit,fdqvmai,t1_fdqsuxc,1578675559.0,"Oh there are a lot of cost savings in reloading, and saving money is entirely possible, just most people tend to just start shooting more and spend the same. I don't have any advice on any of those 3 calibers in particular, I don't have any guns that shoot them. 10mm is up there on my list though. If you haven't check out /r/reloading. Its an active sub and generally nice helpful people."
AskReddit,fdqsc0g,t1_fdqqzu1,1578673826.0,"I don't really stick to one brand of reloading gear, but I have equipment from about every one of them. Cheap Lee dies work just fine, most of my dies are Lee. I have Hornady, RCBS, Lyman, Redding, and some old extinct die brands too. Check Ebay for good deals on dies, I usually sort by 'ending soonest' or cheapest. 

A lot of people will stick to one brand for reloading gear and put down the rest, but for 90%+ of what most people reload, literally any of the brands will work fine. Its a great hobby, just don't think it will save you money. You will spend about the same, just get to shoot more, either more often or more each trip.

It's one of those hobies where the more you do, the more you want to do. You pick up some oddball brass that someone left at the range, and now you are looking into dies and powder when you dont even have a gun that shoots it. Most people would never consider a 338 Lapua or a 458 SOCOM, but hey, you can load and shoot those rounds for less than half the price so maybe it wouldn't hurt to get one..."

AskReddit,fdqqmuo,t1_fdqcx4o,1578672789.0,"I'm not a fan of Ryobi, but that stems from their stuff about 15ish years ago. It was always breaking and the batteries didn't last. I have heard that the new stuff is better, but it's hard to switch to a new tool brand when I already have a bunch of power tools and batteries of one brand.

The few boxes of Hornady ammo I have gotten has been good, but their reloading stuff is really good for the value. Plus they offer a fantastic rebate on their reloading equipment. If I buy reloading dies new, I go with Hornady. They also have fantastic customer service, at least for their reloading department, but I think it's company wide."

I think that the newer models brought back a knob instead of buttons, but I'm not sure."
AskReddit,fdqllzw,t1_fdqk8be,1578669604.0,"I have Stihl chainsaws and a weed eater from my dad that range from 20-30 years old and a chainsaw and weed eater that I bought in the last 5 years are the quality seems to be very similar. Easy to use, can take a beating, and easy to work on. I actually find the newer chainsaw to be more user friendly when it comes to repairs. I've rarely had a bad experience using Stihl stuff new or old. 

Another benefit is that because Stihl stuff is so common, repair parts are generally inexpensive, even for older models. So when the time finally comes that a carb needs replaced or plastic bits crack, I don't have trouble finding them."
