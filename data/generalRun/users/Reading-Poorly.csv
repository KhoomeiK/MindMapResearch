A couple of years ago  I though liking/loving myself was a  just a feeling, a feeling I desperately needed and loathed myself and life for not having.  One day I found a  book called F\*ck Feelings: by Michael Bennett and Sarah Bennett. It explained self-loving is more than a feeling waiting for you. I is the actions of self-care you give yourself such as eating healthy, forgiving yourself, working out, having downtime and giving your self credit for achievements and also positive support despite your defects. That's how you truly love yourself."

I know its difficult, changing jobs, especially when you are working menial lower paying jobs. I actually saved up a safeynet of 6 months worth of living expenses in a saving account before I took the jump to a better job. It made me feel more secure if for some reason the new job didn't work out."
selfimprovement,feupiyq,t3_eqjc3f,1579388744.0,"Job hunting is exceedingly difficult even when you don't struggle with anxiety. I am gripped by my job applications fears due to my poor literacy skills as an adult. Two methods that help me with job hunting are 1. Practice answering interview questions aloud every day. I like to use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Results) you find heaps of examples online. You could also try reading out called calling letters to help with your self introduction confidence.
2. Bring dot point notes and or pre written answers to general interview questions you can read off during interview. I wish someone told me this years ago. This will help you articulate better responses and it shows you have taken the time to prepare for the job. Display your notes in nice folder with a print out of the job advertisement.

Good luck, my friend."

Helped me while I was going through a real rough chapter of my life.

When you stop searching and assuming they can't be found, you guarantee nothing will change""."
