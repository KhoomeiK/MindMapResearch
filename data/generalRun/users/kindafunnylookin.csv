MMORPG,ff5w90o,t3_ero63t,1579612362.0,"I've played most MMOs over the years, sunk the most time into WoW (7 years) and EVE (6 years). Currently playing ESO.

Stopped playing retail WoW after the last expansion was released because the game seems to have run out of ideas beyond ""let's change everything around a bit and see what happens"". Each expac throws away the stuff you spent time on last time, and introduces yet another new mechanic or resource that you have to spend every hour collecting. There's also no challenge to it until you reach end-game mythic. I spent a long time being hyped for WoW Classic, but burned out on that pretty fast too - the challenge is there, and it does a good job bringing back the social aspect of the game, but there's not enough content and too many min-maxers.

EVE is the greatest game ever created, but no fun if you don't like the non-consensual PvP and politics. I think everyone should try it at least once to see what all the fuss is about, though.

I'm really enjoying ESO now, after going back to it for about the third time - for some reason it's clicked with me this time. If you subscribe you get all the DLC, which means there's a ridiculous amount of stuff to do, and the quests are so much more interesting than WoW's ""go collect 10 yeti hides"". The fact that you can build pretty much any type of character and have it be viable is such a testament to the way they've designed skills; crafting is amazing; graphically the world looks incredible (at least coming from WoW it does); and the community is pretty great too from what I've seen so far.

Archeage Unchained would have been my next option, though, although it sounds kind of grindy and the fact that you have to do a load of daily quests to get anywhere kind of puts me off as a casual player."

He actually had a heart attack and died due to the change in lifestyle and putting on so much extra weight. There was a nice end to the story, though; his order accepted him back into the monastery and even let him be buried in the chapel garden there.
