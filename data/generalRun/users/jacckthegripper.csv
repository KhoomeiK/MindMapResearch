I'm finally free of the toxic world that is Haggard, this place is no better either; what do you gain from this sub now? Why spam crazy shit or just rip on people endlessly?

I'm not trying to offend anyone, I'm genuinely curious what you come here for and to suggest maybe taking a step back if you get this worked up about online videos.
