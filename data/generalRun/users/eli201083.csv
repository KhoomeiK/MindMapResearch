I wanna share my son's victory, as well. My oldest son had some severe learning disabilities when he first started school. He fell back as many as 5 reading levels, by the second grade he still had a beginning kindergarten reading level, having trouble with reading, writing and comprehension and life looked like it was gonna be hard for him. To the point where experts, scholastic, medical, and psychological, told us he would need expert help the rest of his life.

That was a year ago. Today, my son will accept first place in a writing competition for Martin Luther King, Jr, among over 10000 (they included the middle schools) kids in his entire school district, 10 schools worth of 3rd and 4th graders, about 300 total in his grade level.

He did it by himself, and worked relentlessly towards the goal, he did slowly but surely, making sure each word was placed exactly as he wanted, and it took twice as long as the other kids. He was proud to finish it, his teachers were proud, and we were proud. But now everyone can be proud because he didn't just finish, he won."
