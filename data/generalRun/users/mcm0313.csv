Police departments have a SCOTUS case granting them permission to set an upper limit for an applicant’s IQ. Some town in Connecticut got tired of smart cops getting bored and moving on and stopped accepting applicants with an IQ over 120. This rule was upheld by multiple courts, all the way to the top. Now, obviously not all departments have that rule, but they’re certainly allowed to. I doubt the military could get away with that."
