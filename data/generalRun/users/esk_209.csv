I suspect this is going to get buried, but OP have you considered doing a modification of your finances?  You state that you and your wife have combined finances.  Being successful with combined finances means agreeing on any purchase that affects the other person.  Vacations should come out of combined finances (usually most successfully done by relative percentages based on income).  But you should each have your own money to spend on what YOU want without having to discuss it with the other person.

Either way, I likely wouldn't do an attendance reward system.  If people are calling out too often you need to examine WHY.  What are the working conditions that are pushing people to take excess time off?  Or, are they taking their earned vacation/personal time?  You don't want to discourage that, and you don't want to do anything that would encourage people to come to work when they'd be healthier staying home.  If you start rewarding ""perfect attendance"" it's likely going to be seen as saying, ""we don't value you enough to let you take your vacation time and we want you here when you're sick"".  This type of reward is a de facto punishment for those people who take their earned sick/vacation/personal time.  Plus, attendance reward systems can easily come across as patronizing and infantalizing. 

If you have a few people who are calling out excessively, then you need to work with those people to figure out why.  If it's on them (lazy, irresponsible, calling in last minute repeatedly and leaving shifts uncovered, whatever) then you need to examine their actual value to the company and decide whether to put them on a PIP (with appropriate training/mentoring) or let them go."

So, despite the fact that (1) the soldiers ~~soldier’s~~ are all adults, (2) it was a weekend, and (3) we had major plans already set and paid for to celebrate our son’s fifth birthday, the PTB wouldn’t excuse him from the mandatory Christmas shopping outing.

1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature, plus more for greasing
1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar
3/4 cup plus 4 teaspoons/200 milliliters sweetened condensed milk
3 large eggs, at room temperature
Seeds from 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 2/3 cups/215 grams all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters dulce de leche

Step 1
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9-inch loaf pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.

Step 2
Using an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream butter and sugar on medium speed until pale and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add condensed milk and mix until incorporated.

Step 3
Add eggs, one at a time, beating well and scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula between additions. Beat in vanilla seeds and vanilla extract (save pod for vanilla sugar or vanilla extract); scrape down the sides of the bowl.

Step 4
Sift flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Add to butter mixture, then beat until just incorporated.

Step 5
Scrape half the batter into prepared pan. Dollop two-thirds of the dulce de leche over batter. Top with remaining batter, then dollop with remaining dulce de leche. Plunge a small offset spatula or long toothpick into batter and swirl to create marbling.

Step 6
Bake until golden at the edges, firm to the touch in the center and a toothpick inserted into center of cake (avoiding dulce de leche) comes out without any wet batter clinging to it, 55 to 70 minutes. Rotate the cake after 20 minutes to ensure even baking.

personalfinance,fcg02hi,t1_fcfw3ds,1577635263.0,"I have always encouraged everyone I worked with (and now my daughter who is serving) to track and declare - not only do you want to avoid any IRS issues, tracking tips lets you prove income for things like apartment leases or home loans."
personalfinance,fcfytm4,t1_fcflc14,1577634965.0,"When I waited tables, tip out was based solely on sales not on actual tips earned.  We generally had to tip out 3% of sales to the host, bus, and bar. We could “hide” all the tips we wanted, but our tip out remained the same."
personalfinance,fcfy7az,t1_fcfib5i,1577634764.0,"If it’s an “auto-gratuity” then it is, legally, a tip and has to go to the server.  If it’s a “service fee” then it’s up to the restaurant to determine where it goes."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fc6wcsv,t1_fc62fjo,1577491188.0,"My MiL got me some as well, but they’re completely fabulous and I’m thrilled.  My other in-laws have gifted me with high-quality kitchen towels in the past.  I’ll never turn up my nose at good kitchen towels."
LifeProTips,fc3vpz6,t3_efyckw,1577399849.0,Every AirBnB I’ve stayed in had that as part of the “terms” of the rental (strip the beds and put any linens and towels used in one pile). I’ve always assumed it was standard for BnB rentals.  TIL it’s not.
Cooking,fc3tzp6,t3_efytgj,1577398585.0,"I got a new set of cooling racks from my stepson. When I opened them he (age 14) said, “you’re welcome, but it’s pretty much a gift for all of us, right?”"
