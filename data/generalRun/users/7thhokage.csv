he only worked trade jobs uptil that point, but hey its cool right cause usually they will usually over look some convictions in the trades right? yea they do! but now days its hard to find work with a reputable or reliable company in the trades with out a drivers license. so he is stuck with unreliable work, unable to get into a more reliable position due to lack of license, which equals lack of reliable transportation. that unreliable work means unreliable pay, and that means he cant always afford to pay child support, so boom back in the hole + fees and interest. its damn near a self sustaining cycle at that point unless you get luck and land a good paying job, and never go a chunk of time under or unemployed.

PoliticalHumor,ffvu77g,t1_ffvr4hg,1580273378.0,"> Except that ""when you support a racist, you support racism, when you support racism, you're a racist"" is true. 

this is false. this would only be true if you are supporting him because he is racist. majority of the german people supported hilter just because they made their lives so much better during that time frame, but many opposed the genocide but still gave hitler their support because everything else was good, they could finally feed themselves again, their work was worth something, they could actually earn a good living......(do those issues sound familiar hmmm almost like desperate people are easy targets.) not every supporter supported him because of his racist views, some just supported him because they weren't suicidal and the country wasnt in a Depression any more.

If we followed your line of logic, everyone who supported hitler was anti-semite and racist. so shouldnt they have been punished just as much as the ones tried after the war? soldiers werent allowed the excuse ""i had to or they would kill me"" so why should that excuse matter for the civilians. it would be like saying if they didnt overtly and directly oppose him they supported him.

>Then why don't they speak up when the racism is to the forefront? Silence is support. 

They did, why didnt you hear them? to assume you know whether or not each and every trump support speaks out about his racism is beyond foolish. 

Did you read the article? there were more than 1 republican that spoke out. sure you can make that excuse about the black rep only stood up when he was target. but the others? in just that 1 article that only covers that one thing just the comments of a hand full of show that there are trump supporters that oppose his racism but dont oppose his presidency. there are more out there i can assure you, i found some them, 3 of the reps are white to so you cant say ""its just cause he targeted them"" if you want more google, i provided 5 examples of politicians showing their opposition to his racism but still supporting the presidency.

There is direct proof that his supporters ***do*** speak out. and ***do*** oppose his racism because they ***are not*** racist.

but hey thanks for that fuck up though. trolls be getting semi good at this shit these days, actually keeping it believable. 10/10. but in the off chance you are not trolling, you 100% dont grasp those fallacies or you would know 100% the way you changed the statements acceptability based on its support to your argument is one of the biggest no-no's you can make in a logical argument."

what tf is the difference between a trump supporter and a maga. i though a maga was one because thats just their catch phrase. didnt know there was a difference. and if you go back i never once used the term maga to describe the group alway trump supporters, so trump supporters is what you should be basing your replies on since that is the base of the conversation. 

> I said that the people who support him are terrible people because they support his racism, crime ect.

this is false, they can condemn those actions or behaviors because they disagree with them, but they agree with more of his policies than they do the democrats. so they, in their minds choose the lesser of two evils. 

it doesnt mean they are racist at heart or as a person, but sadly it does mean they supported a racist, the two are not equal.  look at my school and ice cream example of fallacies, its this to a T.

Now i concede 99.9% of them all are racist, but to say all of them are is not only false but is actually counter productive to diminishing trumps supporters.

it shuts down any hope of  productive conversations with the few that are decent people at heart but dumb AF upstairs, we NEED to be able to have these discussion with those people, so they can see the error in their thinking and learn for the future to better choose a leader.

Look at all the hatred from both sides to each other, thats the major preventive thing here. we are too busy hating each other instead of talking to one another and making the world better for all instead of the loudest voice. 

How quick would you be to have a serious discussion with someone who has never met you or knows anything about you but immediately calls you a racist? (like the guy calling you a neo nazi)

For most people thats it right there end of discussion they are arguing.

>When Obama implemented policies that his voters didn't like, they actively protested it and tried to get him to change it. When has the GoP base ever done that?

Not all have, but those people that do wont get much media coverage because ratings. hating any trump support is in right now sadly. 

>So, when do they ever speak out against Trump? We see former republicans doing that. But never anyone who has stayed part of the party. Where are the right wing/conservative (two different groups) actively protesting Trump's bullshit? 

Some do, just most again due to stupidity toe the party line. i just googled ""repulican speaks out about trump racisim"" and my first link is [party members condemning some racist tweets](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/16/politics/trump-racist-comment-vote-house-gop-list/index.html), while still supporting his other political thoughts. 

so obviously they do speak out and or condemn those actions or behavior. but because of stupidity and politics they will support him, not because they support his racism or even accept it, but because they support his politics more than the other guy. 

you wont see a lot of them hating on trump, because again politics and stupidity. first look at how popular trump supporter hating is on like reddit. how much news coverage and the positive spin on the hate, the republicans that toe the line but speak out against him wont get a lot of time because of ratings, and end the end they are voting for the other guy. 

its not cut and dry, black and white. it never is with people & and or politics. 

>No, everyone who voted for Trump was a Trump supporter. They might still be, but some have chosen to abandon him. Magas however are all Trump supporters, and not only support his worse excesses, but revel in them.

yes you're right on the WAS a supporter part. that is actually a fallacy i missed, but wasnt trying to state a fact more make examples of better statements but i didnt think that one through. but in hindsight im glad i did, because it is the same kind of fallacy as some of the ones you have made. hopefully this will help you realize that. 

>If you support a racist, you support racism, if you support racism, you're a racist. 

Thats false. say the exact same statement but dont use the word racism, use rape. 

By your logic, even if someone never has raped a person, but supports for a rapist, then they are a rapist or support rape? hopefully with the difference between a verb and noun it will make it easier to see the flaw in the logic. because rapist requires a physical action by definition, but you are saying that even if that action was never performed they still some how fit the definition. 

>Where is the GoP resistance to Trump's racism? Where are the GoP members standing up to his criminal actions? Silence is support.

There is, just not all of it is on the nightly news or reddit for you to see. and not all resistance is aggressive or overt. while it is stupid, some are thinking bout the long term, their careers. trump is too popular inside the republican base, and even though yes some dislike him or even dont support him, openly defying your party and fighting against it is a good way to ruin your career. and sadly some people are to selfish to think about the greater good, so they hide to save themselves. 

But selfishness, stupidity, desperation, what ever reason you want to attribute why a trump support supports trump, you have to understand you cant ever attach 1 personality attribute to a whole based on stats of a part.

Lets try the reverse of what you are saying, this usually makes fallacies more apparent. 

i will use my own mistake first as a example: everyone who voted for trump, is a trump supporter. 
now in reverse. 
every trump supporter, voted for trump.  do you see the error here? there are plenty that support trump but have never voted a day in their lives.

Now yours. trump is a racist. every trump supporter, supports a racist,so they therefore support  racism and is therefor a racist themselves.
now in reverse.
Every racist, supports racism, and since trump is racist every racist supports trump. but we sadly know that is false. hope you can see the error here. 

heres another example.
p1: Fascists support a strong military.
P2: John Q. Warhawk supports a strong military.
C: Therefore, John Q. Warhawk is probably a fascist.

you see the issue there right? if not, not being mean but [you should go through this sometime,](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Logical_fallacy) i go through it semi often to try and refresh and learn to better improve logical thought process. no one is a perfect, and not trying to be a dick or argumentative just hoping you can see the error in your logical thought process. its kinda like making a mistake during a math calculation but still getting the right answer on accident.  yes you got the right answer in the end somehow, but how you got there was all wrong and most likely wont work again. 

Simply while most are racist, not all trump supporters are racist, some are just stupid, or desperate and think he is the only hope or ect.

but im thinking its not so much in your control. i think you assume that if someone hated trumps guts that they would never vote for him. thats not how it works. it happens all time time. people will go to extraordinary lengths to toe the party line or just not vote for the other guy because they hate them just a little bit more. comes back to the shiniest of two turds issue of our 2 party system. 

Also im thinking using the term ""Trump Supporter"" is limiting your view on what that means. a trump supporter in my eyes is anyone that voted for him, and plans to do so again. not someone that agrees or feels the same as him on every issue. maybe they just agree more with the republican party ideals than democratic, so they will vote for who ever is the republican.

PoliticalHumor,ffrn1e3,t1_ffqzyrg,1580161433.0," to play devil's advocate here Trump supporters arent exactly treated well by most, hell horribly by most. Yes it's a two sided deal but two wrongs don't make a right.

Yea sure some probably deserve it, but not all of em.

 Some Trump supports are good people, they are just different than most of us. 

Yes their views differ and sometimes greatly from most of us, but it's still their views to have and share. 

I don't understand why there is so much literal hatred and just in general stereotyping going on. People have differing opinions on the country and the laws.

 Just because we don't agree with them or their world views, it doesn't give us the moral high ground to group them all into one group of insults and demean them all as a whole. 

Pick out the specific idiots saying and doing racist or hateful shit. But don't pick on them just because their political beliefs are different.

All of us, are equally fucked or not fucked. We as a nation, as a society are in this together whether you like it or not. 

Now we can keep picking on each other for our problems, or we can actually take our issues to those responsible. Not the voters, the politicians that betray them, or give them false promises. Don't punish those gullible enough to hope for something better, punish those that take advantage of that to benefit their own class. 

Which btw idgaf who you are or what you do for a living, not a single soul in this thread is a part of the class that actually gets the attention, your bank account has no where near enough digits.

Edit: so its widely accepted that making judgments, and stereotypes based on peoples age, gender, race, nationality, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, and ect, makes you a literal waste of human flesh. 

So what the fuck makes it ok to do it based on political beliefs?

It's ok to choose a god that may thrive on evil, death and destruction, but not ok to choose a more crooked than usual politcian?? The hypocrisy is mind blowing"

Edit: Went ahead and did the math. Assuming 8 subway cars, weighted the same as the average new york car, + the body weight of 100 average people at 165lbs, little high for averages because idk the average gender ratio but helps account for amount.

3rd edit: turns out the average body weight was raised 10lbs since last time i checked. leaving the lower number to reduce the impact just to prove the point.

4th edit, here is the numbers to check it. 1 subway car @ 85,200lbs * 8=698,100lbs + 100 people @ 165 lbs =698,100 lbs * 10mph or 4.47m/s. finding the momentum/force of the train using P=MV"
