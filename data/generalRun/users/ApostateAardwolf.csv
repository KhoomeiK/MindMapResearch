Ultimately I see it like this, the DNCs experiment of running a centrist (and I don’t see that label as a slur) against Trump failed in 2016. It’d be madness to run that experiment again in 2020.

Warren and CNN failed spectacularly in their attempt to smear Bernie as sexist and it backfired. Following Rogans endorsement CNN are running with the “Rogans a homophobic racist transphobe”, this will also backfire.
