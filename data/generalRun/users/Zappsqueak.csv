They will simply have multiple accounts they're fucking around with. Most people I knew had multiple accounts that could've been made believable quite easily, and that was just to cheat in silly FB games and stuff.

VeganDE,fcln5av,t3_eha1tt,1577751708.0,"Hm. Silvester war das einzige Fest, das ich gefeiert habe. Wird dieses Jahr nicht passieren, weils mit dem diesjÃ¤hrigen Abschussverbot in der Innenstadt fÃ¼r mich nichts spezielles/interessantes mehr zu tun gibt.

Ironischerweise ist es in den AuÃŸenbereichen, wo es wirklich sowas Ã¤hnliches wie Natur und Tiere gibt, weiterhin erlaubt. (Und wo es erfahrungsgemÃ¤ÃŸ immer am gefÃ¤hrlichsten war, weil die Spacken dauernd in die BÃ¤ume geschossen haben und Feuerwerkszeug gern auch mal noch brennend wieder runtergekommen ist.)

Das Verbot bei uns tut also absolut Ã¼berhaupt nichts fÃ¼r Sicherheit, Umwelt und Tier; es behebt nur, dass jemand am nÃ¤chsten Tag auf dem Rathaus fegen muss.

mMn wird hier nur der Umwelt-Hype genutzt, um die BÃ¶llerei aus ganz anderen GrÃ¼nden zu verbieten. 

Jemand hat das neulich mal durchgerechnet, der Umweltschaden ist verschwindend gering. Ich hab die Zahlen leider nicht da, aber das Ergebnis war, dass jeder, der an Silvester bÃ¶llert, so viel Umweltschaden anrichtet, als wÃ¼rde er einmalig 200 Meter mit dem Auto fahren."

So the line of reasoning you used for the first case is obviously flawed. The actual argument is not ""don't be a dick, he's not a child, if he says he's in an open relationship he is"". The actual argument is ""I don't give a shit as long as it does not directly hurt *me*"".
