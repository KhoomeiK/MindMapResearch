I don’t doubt there would be people who would buy, I just don’t know the kind of volume that’s needed to make it profitable for Nike.  These are just broad strokes, but a quick google shows the number of runners in the US at 60 million vs. just over 4 million triathletes.  Recognizing they would never get 100% of either market that’s still a pretty substantial drop off in potential, especially considering their “average” shoes can tap into *both* market.

I dunno though - I also can’t see them (any shoe company) stopping innovation when they *can* make a faster shoe. I mean, it’s ultimately a marketing problem (the volume is in the consumer market, not the handful of elites buying them) so they may very well find a way to sell them even if they lose the “pro use” angle."
