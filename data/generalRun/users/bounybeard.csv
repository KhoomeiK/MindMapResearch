Just because you fight an oppressive government which would justify being resisted doesn't mean you are universally good or acceptable. There are a whole bunch of things that MK did which that are simply wrong no matter who you are fighting:

&#x200B;

* Targeting of innocent people
* Targeting of children
* Targeting of rival anti government groups that pose no threat to you
* Targeting of political rivals within the organisation
* Targeting of places of worship

MK was basically an IRA style bombing campaign (and you don't need to look far into my post history to know as someone with serious connections to Northern Ireland I don't like the IRA no matter how pasty they are).

The biggest thing that MK did that was wrong though is it simply didn't have a plan to overthrow the state, like all terrorists their plan was basically just kill innocent people and see what happens.

For an African liberation group that did things the right way go to SWAPO from what is now Namibia who fought the South Africans for liberation and independence by actually fighting (and in the end kind of defeating) the army, not bombing children choirs, strangling innocent people with barbed wire and assuming that at some point the government was just going to give in.

* Generally just don't fight, a bad idea. Defending your ego, honour or reputation are just not worth it for the risk. Honestly defending your wallet isn't really either but from a guy for basically fights for money that sounds a bit rich. But people have no idea how dangerous fighting is because most people haven't actually experienced a proper fight (no your shoving match with Timmy Granger in primary 7 doesn't count), if your head at any point lands on concrete there's a pretty high chance of you being fucked in some way either through broken bone, brain injury or death.
* 1 year of experience if cancelled out by roughly 5kg/10lbs up to about 120kgs/260lbs at typical height. Don't matter how if a 40kg 14 year old has been training since they was 3 and has 3 black belts they're going to get their arse kicked by a 100kg man any day of the week.
* Less than 0.5% of woman are as strong as the average man (figure goes from 0.5% to 0.09% depending how you measure it). Even trained female athletes are typically not stronger than small men. If you're a woman just don't fight men, it doesn't matter if movies and the current culture tells you it's easy I promise you that it's not.
* Don't throw the first punch doesn't matter how much the other guy is sizing up to you just keep stepping back and even (somewhat gently) push him back. Legal consequences for fighting are typically nasty.
* Never kick under any circumstances, most of the time you'll just get pushed over and then have some wanker jump up and down on your head until you become a statistic. Sometimes the wanker will instead grab the leg and then raise it above your head and then the head jumping will commence. Someone else said kick but not above the shins, nah that's silly that just means you're close enough to be shoved over easier.
* Hold your hands up in from of your face but leave room to be able to see (this is a common mistake). Be ready to drop them at any point to defend from lower strikes.
* Keep feint punches in mind, most strikes thrown in fights don't actually land and if you go all the way to block a punch that was never meant to land you'll get hit somewhere else.
* If you bend your wrist while punching you're going to break your wrist.
* If you're going to punch someone don't tap them and then jump back, follow through, imagine it like kicking a football (soccer ball).
* If you're in a knife fight you're going to get nicked, it's just how that works. Your objective is to gain control of your attackers weapon not to avoid getting nicked. Movies and tv shows like to show actually grabbing the knife and sure you can do that but the wrist is usually easier to hold on to if nothing else.
* If you're fighting multiple people and they're serious you're going to loose, sorry."

Drug prices are incredibly inflated due to markups, small scale production, product loss to police, risk and smuggling. For instance cocaine in the UK costs 23 times as much as it does in Latin America where much of the production happens.

I think there would be a major difference in a crackdown on drugs with this in place as it would provide a necessary alternative to push people away from the illegal drug market.

It would be a tiny fraction actually accessing services and staff and infrastructure that isn't actually the NHS even depite the structural damage the Tories have done to it.

This is near complete fantasy, the idea that all the doctors and nurses who supplement their salaries with private money or the private doctors and nurses would just accept a pay cute is... well come on you're better than this. Given the massive rate of emigration for both doctors and nurses they'll probably end up moving to either somewhere else in Europe or (particularly for doctors) another anglosphere country. And then it's not like those newly acquired hospitals are free to run, like it or not private patients pay money for their healthcare and that money would have to be replaced.

>And the point about leaving the country is fair enough. But you already cut a chunk of people out on affordability because you're turning a cheap option into seeking bespoke medical treatment in a foreign country. And then there are those who simply won't. And that's not really an innocuous behavior anyway. If we don't do this sort of thing as a country, it becomes much less reasonable socially. They'll still do it, but people won't act as if that's fair. It's rich people not being in this with the rest of us. And what would the complaints look like from those who do it? ""We don't provide this in this country"" is something that can rally people to do something about it. Whereas the most sinister phrase in society right now is ""help is provided"" (seriously this is a whole other rant). It doesn't matter that the way you get seen by a doctor is to jump the queue because if everyone who ""isn't paying for it"" (which, we are) waits 4 years they might get to see that specialist. Whereas if everyone is in it together, the way to improve service isn't to cheat. It's to actually improve it.

AskReddit,fgg9hk2,t3_ey7at1,1580757131.0,We have the world's highest rate of recorded assault per capita. Now I recon we're actually not number one because we have a pretty effective police force and relatively high reporting rates relative to the third world but we're still a lot more violent than any other country within our region and possibly any other first world country. Weirdly low murder rate though.

AskEurope,fgcgiy2,t3_exrjp1,1580672499.0,Heard someone in my mother's home town (Northern Ireland) who managed to severely piss off some local paramilitaries got beaten severely then shot in both kneecaps and castrated with the third shot. Just about the worst punishment shooting I've heard of that wasn't lethal. I assume this counts.
AskEurope,fgc4chv,t3_exl5ny,1580668927.0,I eat smoked mackerel with rice at least once a week and probably some other sea food too. I also love me some smoked salmon and often get it as a treat. Maybe 2-3 times a week.
Scotland,fgc2yms,t1_fgc2f5v,1580668580.0,In my experience the doormen typically tell the owners to fuck off as we don't want to jepordise our licenses. But yeah probably gets enforced a lot more than I've seen unfortunately.

todayilearned,fgb4ecp,t3_exdi9i,1580658387.0,I think part of the reason for this though is that drivers aren't so familiar with them and so pay way more attention than they would on a crossroads. I doubt these same stats are replicated here in the UK where we have loads of roundabouts. It seems like this would be a case where the point of diminishing returns comes on quickly.

Scotland,fg3o826,t1_fg3n0oc,1580486082.0,I feel like they might make an exception in some ways when the rules were set up they didn't expect parts of other states to be breaking off and joining the EU. They especially didn't forsee states that used to be in the EU breaking off and little bits breaking off from them and reapplying for EU membership.
Scotland,fg3kbrc,t3_ewp91m,1580483586.0,I don't think it would be a good idea for us to have our own currency. Don't get me wrong we could do it and it wouldn't be too bad but we're probably too small a nation for it. I think it would be sensible to either adopt the Euro or have a currency pegged to the US dollar. Either would basically work fine.

Most Estonians are still pretty poor by our standards and as a result many of them have left to live in the Western EU.
