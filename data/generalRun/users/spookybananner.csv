I asked her, ""But you're vaccinated, right? Because I'm immunocompromised."" And she said ""Yeah, I have to be for work."" Like?? But you're okay?? You're not only a medically trained professional, but YOU are vaccinated. Are you serious?? Luckily she left for medical leave (some type of surgery, idk) and I'll be gone soon, because I'm not 100% comfortable with her being around."

My SO has bipolar and is very similar to this when he's not on his meds. It's very frustrating because it makes me feel unloved and unwelcome. It also makes me worry about him, which isn't fair to me. Luckily he's on top of it 99% of the time and is such a great, loving partner as a result. But he HAS to take his meds.

Talk to your boyfriend. Tell him that not only is it important for his own mental health, but that it's important for your relationship, and his other relationships with family/friends. Otherwise, you shouldn't have to put up with his bad days, because it WILL break your heart everytime he does this. If he doesn't take his own health seriously, you can't fix it for him."
relationship_advice,fg9cxt4,t3_exm5os,1580637149.0,"I could personally never be with a man who thinks this way. For one, he's just that, a man, and his opinion on the whole thing is worthless because he'll never understand it, because he'll never be in that situation. Secondly, it shows a basic lack of understanding on the subject matter. His opinion is anti-science, anti-fact, and anti-women.

Ask yourself this: let's say you get pregnant, and you decide you don't want to keep it and you want another abortion. Doesn't matter why, because it should never matter. Would he be okay with that? Probably not, right? Would it be a point of contention for you two? Probably.

If it looks like statistics and facts won't persuade him, leave. He will never change his mind and it's one of those things I think couples should agree on. Basically he thinks it's murder and you *know* it isn't. That's a huge difference in ideals and ""morals"". He didn't say it but he probably thinks of you, at least in some aspect, as a baby killer. That's fucked and so, so wrong. I'm not saying he's a bad person, and I'm sure he cares about you/loves you greatly, but he's a dumb at the very least and possibly a misogynist at worst."

todayilearned,ffywi9w,t1_ffyod5f,1580356903.0,He came out and said that's not the case because people kept asking him if he was working on Dream and Winds simultaneously like he did for Feast and Dance. So... Sorry :(

I read three or four + the short story collection odd jobs, under my mom and brother's recommendation, but they just weren't for me. Half the time I don't like how he writes his female characters and Harry himself isn't that interesting of a protag for me. They're alright, the world is cool, but meh."

AskReddit,ffdme9x,t1_ffb7m1c,1579823971.0,"It was insanely lax! I moved on to The Disney Store about a year before Hastings totally collapsed and the difference was astounding. So clean, so high energy, no bullshit, and super strict on LP. Hastings didn't gaf. Also we'd totally accept obviously stolen goods for trade ins and we couldn't say anything. Had a guy who'd bring in three or four copies of a new release every week, still in his Target uniform. And every week he'd be like, oh, I got these as gifts... Sure, buddy. Here's your $30. 

Luckily I was in the music department 90% of the time so I got to pick new releases to play SUPER LOUDLY every day. So loudly in fact, that I often couldn't hear them page me over the intercom when they needed keys or help up front. Asked if I could turn it down while I was working, nope lol. It had to be that volume so you could kinda hear it through the whole store. What a mess."
AskReddit,ffdktp1,t1_ffcnkz2,1579823000.0,"Ours was like a fancy closet. We had a table with two chairs, count em, two! And some busted up employee lockers, many of which no longer had doors and/or locks. We also had a full sized fridge, which was nice, despite the fact that I was the only one who cleaned it lol."
AskReddit,ffbh2c4,t1_ffbg3to,1579764967.0,"Well it didn't help that for some reason the customers at this location were just so gd messy/rude (trashy west Texas people, what can I say). I could turn my back on the shirt display for two minutes and come back to shirts on the floor, the wrong shirts in the wrong bins, etc. Half my day was usually spent picking up the shit customers literally threw on the floor, including their trash. But yeah no, management also didn't care. I went to other stores in different cities and they were waaay nicer. Ours was always kinda... Foreboding and run down lol. Flickering lights in the bathrooms, kinda dingy/old/smelly break room, equipment that didn't work, etc."
AskReddit,ffaymb0,t1_ffa67ri,1579747512.0,"Yuuup. Worked there for a few years and I loved the job but it was so obvious we were gonna fail. When I got promoted to AM because I was the only one in the music/misc/comic department who cleaned and organized, I knew it was doomed. If your employees aren't even proactive enough to do basic shit like vacuum or pick up stuff off the floor, something has gone horribly wrong lol. 

Orders took months to come in sometimes, or didn't come in at all. People's comic subscriptions stopped showing up. So much theft, like SO MUCH. Everyday I'd find 5+ empty packages tucked away somewhere. Our anti-theft sensors (not sure what they're called exactly, the gadgets at the front doors that go off if something still has the sticker on it) didn't even work 75% of the time, and once a girl set it off and said, ""Oh sorry, I was coming in to trade some stuff in but I forgot my wallet, I guess the sensor is still on something. I'll be right back."" Never showed back up, was obviously stealing stuff in retrospect. They didn't even train us in loss prevention or tell us what to do if we caught someone stealing and of course there was no dedicated LP team.  Like I don't really care if some teenage girl is stealing phone charms or whatever, I don't get paid enough to care about that, but it seemed like the company itself didn't really care and they were probably hemorrhaging money.

This guy and I were hired on the same day and like three days later he wasn't around, and also they said I couldn't carry the keys to the game disk cabinet anymore, a manager had to give them to me as needed. I asked why, turned out the other dude just stole a ton of the disks and walked out the day before. It was insane. I liked the job overall though lol"

movies,fcp6llc,t1_fcopuso,1577852174.0,"I've kind of started downvoting all the recent Disney circle jerk bullshit lately. SO many posts and memes about Disney+, baby Yoda, TILs and movie facts about their old movies, new movies, the MCU, etc etc. I'm sure some of it is just regular redditors but I'd bet money on most of it being posted by shill/PR accounts. It's super annoying. I'm downvoting them out of principal now even though it's just a drop in the bucket."
