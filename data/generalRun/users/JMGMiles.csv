atheism,fg43rc9,t1_fg43dg1,1580495538.0,"Most Christian's are wrong about what it means to be Christian. I cant speak for anthropology, but before Jesus,Jewish law dictated no one except Jews could have a connection with God and go to heaven...Jews did not associate with Samaritans for similar reasons. God does not punish people for ignorance though, and this was wrong.

Jesus did what he did so ANYONE can chose to believe in him and be saved, not just Jews. So my understanding and belief is it doesnt matter where or what you come from.

Edit - and as a Christian of course he was a Jew. He did all the things a jew would do except follow most of everything involved in rules and laws of the old covenant...instead spoke out against them."
atheism,fg42wqi,t1_fg41gxj,1580495033.0,"This is why Jesus came - yes. The ""good news"" in the bible was that you don't have to follow the laws of Moses, aside from the 10 commandments which were given to him by God. The 10 commandments is just telling people not to be a fucking asshole, and believe in God.

This is why Jesus was crucified, because he was telling people this is no longer the way. Don't sacrifice goats or stone people. Love everyone no matter what, and do not judge someone for anything they do. He contradicted a great deal about the old covenant, and through his own life, being sent by God, created a new one. 

It was the Pharisees in power that were threatened by this and who had him persecuted. They did not want the old ways to change as they had amassed power from it. The new teachings allowed for a ""personal"" connection to God. 

Being a Christian means believe in Jesus, don't be a dick, and pray and hold reverence for God. It doesn't mean stone a stubborn wife or rebellious son. Jesus was a radical nonviolent revolutionary who hung around with lepers, hookers, and crooks. Wasn't american, and never spoke english. He was anti-wealth, anti-death penalty, anti-public prayer, but was never anti-gay, never mentioned abortion or birth control, never called the poor lazy. He never justified torture or fought for tax cuts for the richest Nazarenes. Never asked a leper for a co-pay and was a long-haired, brown-skinned, homeless, community-organizing, anti-slut shaming middle eastern Jew.

Jews are a people, who God ""chose"" to work through (he likes to choose underdogs or people who are heavily persecuted), but a Christian does not need to practice Judaism before becoming Christian. Jesus and God, however, would have like anyone who previously practiced Judaism (or any other religious teachings) to follow his new testament teachings now, though. The NEW covenant (Christianity) and not the OLD one (Judaism).

In doing so, they ""signed"" it in a manner of speaking, and now we don't have to sacrifice goats and shit. We don't have to chastise ourselves as the Catholics do.

atheism,fg3pkwb,t3_ewie53,1580486923.0,"Typing this as a Christian, but I don't come here to argue or to cause hate or anything like that. This is my understanding of some of the problems you have with the bible.

Judaism has the Torah, which is the bible before the new testament. When Jesus started his gospel he did away with Moses's laws, which contains horrible things like stoning your ""stubborn"" wife and rebellious son to death. Like Mary Magdalene, the Pharisees took Jesus to her as a ""test"" and said ""Look, this woman has been caught in the act of prostitution and our laws dictate we stone her to death"". I'm sure you know the rest about how Jesus picked up a stone and said ""whoever is without sin, may cast the first stone"".

Jesus was put to death because of the changes he brought to the Jewish religion, saying ""I come from the father and he has commanded me to live my life as an example for you to now follow"". Don't judge, love your enemies, and the only commandments you should follow are the ""10 commandments"", which the first 4 are to worship God only, basically and the rest are just saying ""don't be a shitty person"". Don't steal, lie, kill, envy someone elses wife or possessions, and listen to your parents. Other laws for the way jewish people were supposed to live there life in the old testament have been done away with, through Jesus. Why God chose to or had to go through the first part off human life by almost setting us up for failure...I don't know.

I understand that God has done some weird things that don't make sense, like putting a temptation in the garden of Eden and creating laws which no one could truly follow or uphold fully - or laws that would in the future, be looked upon as a despicable way to live your life. ""His ways are not our ways"", as the bible says. Perhaps he knew if he started us out with the salvation by grace that Jesus set up, we would fail still, or that future generations like ours would need to understand that God sent his spiritual son in Jesus to live the life of a man, to become the ""son of man"", in order for anyone in this day and age to accept God as God and have faith? Who knows. What I do know and accept is that God does possess the only foresight into the future and things happened the way they happened for a reason.

Christians that refuse making a cake for gay couples, or pastors that preach riches through prayer, any evangelical, or pastors that state Jesus would ""kick someone ass"" - they're not Christians. I try to live my life as a Christian with the only difference from atheists  being that I believe Jesus was the son of God, and that God is real. Everything else is kind of common sense - be kind to other people, don't judge, forgive bad shit people do. That's about it.

Also, BTW - I understand that ""slave"" in the times it's written in the bible for the Jews meant ""people in your debt"". Jews were slaves themselves for 400 years or whatever, they did not keep slaves in that regard.

&#x200B;

Edit - The ""clean"" vs ""unclean"" foods in the Torah was in regards to things that would ""defile"" a mans heart or soul. Jesus again turned this around and said ""it's not what a man puts into his stomach that defiles him, as it passes the heart and goes through the body"". The original stuff about not eating pork or shit that crawls on it's belly wasn't said in regards to disease or to avoid sickness."
