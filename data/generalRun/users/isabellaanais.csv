entwives,fewckma,t3_eqrfu9,1579408400.0,This is extra just like guac is extra... WORTH IT.
socialanxiety,fev5fj7,t1_fev55ld,1579393323.0,You brought up the concept of “little frightened animal”. So I was simply following your logic...? But okay.
socialanxiety,fev4uqs,t1_feutxzi,1579393105.0,"That’s not true. Most positive reinforcement training, for dogs specifically, is done through exposure therapy while creating a safe environment. Dog slowly creeps towards success with a skill, dog gets treat. Dog learns that the more they do this scary thing, the less scary it is because treats create a happy and safe cognitive reward."
socialanxiety,fev4bdn,t1_feuuvfv,1579392978.0,"Hmm I would argue that doing things that make you uncomfortable teaches you skills. Public speaking is actually a really important skill for an individual. It teaches you how to organize thoughts and utilize critical thinking skills in order to more effectively communicate with the world around you. For my bachelors degree, I have no way around my public speaking class credits, and I fucking hate that I have to do it, but I understand that I am learning valuable skills even if it sucks. Life is always going to throw crap at you- it’s how you adapt and react to that stuff that matters."

socialanxiety,feps0sb,t3_eq9aem,1579329307.0,"Honestly though, exposure therapy isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Avoiding hard and uncomfortable things isn’t necessarily good either."
plantclinic,fefy4lu,t3_eoy686,1579069126.0,"Yeaaaahhhh fiddle leaf figs are already very finicky plants, and drainage holes are a must even for non-finicky plants... the damaged leaves won’t revert back unfortunately, and sounds like you have root rot, especially if you’re watering once a week with no drainage."
