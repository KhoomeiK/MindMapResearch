Are you okay with him getting a DNA test and walking out because of something that happened before you were born, that you had no control over?

I'm sure you're thinking that that couldn't happen to you.  But there are more bastards out there than you think, but most of their Dad's did the right thing and stuck it out for the kid.

You always need to know whether the person you're talking to has a vagina, right?  Otherwise, you might not know exactly how to make them feel uncomfortable.

In a medical context, sex difference is important.  It's actually a big problem.  Doctors historically, and still many today, just assumed women's and men's bodies react the exact same to all medical treatments, but it turns out that they don't.

One more reason to dislike that movie.

My understanding was that digital effects studios were generally slammed and people made quite a bit there, but I guess it's a different skill set from CGI animation.
