It’s hard to say if you should leave or stay because that is entirely up to you. My thoughts are 1) do you think you can ever trust her again? 2) do you think it’s worth salvaging this relationship? 

Because once trust is broken it takes a lot to find it again and even then it’s never the same.

“Trust is like a mirror, you can fix it if it's broken, but you can still see the crack in its reflection.” 

There is no wrong decision here. I hope everything works out for the best."
