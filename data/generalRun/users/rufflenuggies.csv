HappyDogHappyLife,ff9o026,t1_ff9k5xd,1579716989.0,Thank you üòä How did you come up with the names for your pets?
HappyDogHappyLife,ff9iqg3,t3_esf1o5,1579713874.0,"My first dog, a wonderful loving Shih Tzu, was named Belle. Hurricane Isabel was moving through our area the day we brought her home, and we got the remnants of it with very high winds and rains (but thankfully no deaths or injuries) and I thought it would be cute to name her after the storm. We shortened it to ""Belle"" because Belle means beautiful in French and is easier to say. 

Our newest pup is a 12 week old Shih Tzu we named ""Indie"". ""Indie"" music is my favorite kind of music and I thought it was a cute name for a little girl pup."
ChronicPain,ff9cduo,t1_ff5mfd6,1579709796.0,"Thank you. I have tried to take one with my long acting pain medicine here and there and I do get more of a pain relieving effect when I do so, but I wasn't sure if I was hurting myself by doing so. I appreciate you taking the time to answer my question!"

POTS,ff96k23,t3_eqsq6s,1579706030.0,Yes I vacationed in the Colorado Rockies a few months back and had increased dizziness and severe episodes of air hunger. It took a few days for my body to adjust but it was really bad the first two days.
ChronicPainPlayhouse,ff95uik,t1_ff94sz7,1579705552.0,"That research contradicts what myself and many many other chronic pain patients have found taking opioids. Without my opioids, my pain is a 9, I can't leave the bed, I would have to crawl to the bathroom. I would be crying in agony, unable to move or do anything. I wouldn't have a life. With them my pain goes down to a 3 or 4. I'm able to sleep and homeschool my son and spend time playing with our new puppy. I really don't understand the outcomes of these ""studies"" sometimes."

RBI,ff3i2vc,t1_ff3hy2j,1579541500.0,I didn't receive any other texts after that. I still wonder if I should go to the police. Were the pictures you received similar in content? I was afraid I had a stalker situation beginning.
RBI,ff3hm1s,t3_erfu66,1579541212.0,"This happened to me and it was a number from my area code which made me all the more freaked out. The picture was definitely NSFL and I had trouble determining if the woman in those pictures was a willing participant or was being gagged and chained up against her will. I'm a woman btw and felt like she had a look of fear on her face. I did what you did and deleted it quickly without thinking. I didn't want my kids to see it. I thought that was the end of it but a week later I was texted from a different number, again also in my area code, with a different woman in a similar circumstance but on train tracks. I screenshotted it this time and asked my husband what he thought I should do. I was considering going to the police just to make sure the girl was a willing participant and not in any danger."

ChronicPain,ff1vco0,t1_ff1unvj,1579487007.0,"I was taking 20mg OxyContin 2x day so I should be taking 100mg Nucynta 2x a day I believe. I had already had a dose reduction of 30mg OxyContin 2x a day from my old pain management doctor 5 months ago, and I couldn't afford dropping down in dosage that time. I've had uncontrolled pain ever since that reduction. Now I've been further reduced :("
ChronicPain,ff1sfza,t1_ff1rs3h,1579485159.0,It's not working like my old medicine did. Butmy doctor also cut my dose without telling me so it's going to suck until I can straighten it out with her. I still have my oxycodone IR 10mgs to take 3x a day but my pain is still very high round the clock
ChronicPain,ff1a32i,t1_ff18ic2,1579476739.0,Wow that sucks! I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it doesn't have that effect on me. I'm due to take my first dose in 30 minutes :/
ChronicPain,ff14ua2,t1_ff12t2q,1579475193.0,Does it help with your other types of pain (if you have other types)?
ChronicPain,ff0ww89,t1_ff0jee4,1579473058.0,"Yeah I actually have an allergy to Morphine and opioids that are related, so that cuts a lot of covered meds out for me. I also don't tolerate the pain meds with ibuprofen and aspirin combined with them. If I don't tolerate the Nucynta my pharmacist said we can petition to have the OxyContin covered. I hope that's true!"
ChronicPain,ff0wlkp,t1_ff0l638,1579472976.0,I have a $6000 deductible I need to pay before insurance kicks in. I picked up the Nucynta today and 30 days worth of 100mg was $200. My doctor did the conversion wrong though so my dose is almost half of what I was taking in OxyContin :/ I need to call her tomorrow because that's not going to work.

ChronicPain,feomin8,t1_feoj9wd,1579302185.0,"Do you think it was the amitriptiline that caused your pain to increase? I really can't handle any more pain! I do take Celexa as well as I have anxiety from the pain and mast cell disorder. 

With the mushrooms, do you microdose them?"

prolife,fek55yq,t3_epldj6,1579192831.0,"I suffered with Intrahepatic Cholestatis of pregnancy with my daughter and my son. We weren't sure what it was when I was pregnant with my daughter because it only effected the last month of pregnancy. When I became pregnant with my son we knew 100% it was IHC. You basically go into liver failure and your gallbladder spills bile out of it and your entire body itches insanely 24/7 until you give birth. I was near suicidal but my concern was always for my son. I knew my liver would go back to normal and my itching would stop after he was born. But for a fetus, IHC can be deadly in the last month of pregnancy because of passing menconoim and the baby aspirating it. We did an amnio at 36 weeks and his lungs were developed enough that we induced labor. When he was born I was so happy that his and my struggles were over and that we were safe and had each other! Never for a moment did I blame my son for my intense insanity-inducing itching or my medical condition. It wasn't his fault. And he's not some slimey crotch-goblin. He is now a very empathic, kind 12 year old who has enriched mine and my husband's lives beyond measure. I often look at my sister who is now 46 and childless and alone and remember when I was a clueless 22 year old thinking I would be childless forever since kids were ""too much work"". I was so wrong."

Firearms,fejnpoj,t1_fejnaq3,1579180985.0,"I agree with you on a few points. There is increasing tyranny on many levels of our government/police that doesn't involve gun rights. But as gun rights are protected Constitutionally, when the government tries or does erode those rights, it's a slippery slope. What's to stop them from reversing the 13th amendment if we are all completely powerless and don't fight to protect our rights? I would be just as angry and against that if that were to happen and so would all of us. Don't give them more power than they already have. Sadly we have to fight to keep what is already guaranteed. I guess it wasn't much of a guarantee."

I want my black, Latino, Asian, Native American, etc etc brothers and sisters to take up their rights to carry as well. It is protection against a tyrannical government rising up against us (ala the American Revolution) . Why should corrupt government, police, and military have guns but not citizens? We have a right to keep our selves, homes, and families safe as well. It's a God given right."
