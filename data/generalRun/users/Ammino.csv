Christianity,fdu9bvi,t3_emokcb,1578729826.0,"I believe God wants you to prosper and find your everyday needs in Him but that’s not where it ends. God desires to bless you, in every part of you. He has a plan for you and to find out what Gods will for your life is - He will show you. Creation belongs to Him and everything in it, below and above was made to worship Him. If sin had not entered the world we would be living in blessing but that was taken away only to be brought back in Christ Jesus for salvation and a means for all creation to be held together so even though we live now in this world, in Him he will accomplish only what He can do in and through us."
