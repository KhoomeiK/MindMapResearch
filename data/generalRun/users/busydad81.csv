AskReddit,feyup0q,t1_fexvpwy,1579450753.0,"My g-ma did this. She was born in 1938 and as soon  as she realized she could, well she called it “taping my stories”, she went and got two more tv’s and another vcr. One tv was for watching while the others recorded. She worked at Kmart and was a lay-away expert (with coupons and discounts etc) and when she found out they made a Vcr that let you record one channel while watching another she got that one to and added it to her 3rd tv. Her first “vcr” was actualky a Beta-Max but she ditched that one pretty quick. I remember she essentially made 4yo me a video mix tape with muppet babies, thunder cats, mask, and go bots (and a few others I can’t remember). I was actually quite surprised that her cable modem was such a conundrum to her. I used to wonder what new technology my future grandkids would have to teach me and then think, nah I’m never gonna be like that. If my grandmother could figure out how to record 3 shows at a time, I’d be fine. But the key isn’t intelligence it’s interest/benefit/necessity. If it’s not something you’re interested in doing, or that benefits you greatly, or if it’s not something you just have to learn it (like I have to eventually figure out the bells and whistles on each new iOS) then you’re probably not going to figure it out. Especially if you have someone to do it for you."

YouShouldKnow,fekljor,t3_epgcr8,1579202560.0,"(I was a “victim” ) They don’t leave reviews from your account. They only have your address because you ordered something from them. When it happened to me, I had ordered something from China. I think it was the Sloth Smoking a Joint Ugly Christmas Sweater that I ordered for a work party late 2017. Anyway, shortly after it arrived I started getting packages with randomness. Lots of them. Some of them were quite useful. Amazon was not aware of the issue yet at the time, but assured me my account was secure (changed my pw anyway) and they told me to keep the stuff. I checked my banks and credit cards...nothing. Ever. Yet they came sporadically over a year and a half. All from China. And the randomness never ceased to amuse. Many things came in handy. I got cheap wigs, led replacement bulbs, underwear (men and women’s), a couple of adult toys, water bottles, paper lamps, multiple bags of plastic beads but not the kind you thread but ones you’d pit in a fish tank, and a few useful things like a water bottle with a bowl for when I walk my dog, a cheap bbq set with silicone mits; metal tongs; basting brush; and those pork-pulling fork claw things. Some times I’d get the same thing over like this one wax warmer for dipping your hand in and peeing off dead skin, and all sorts of charging cables, many I still have. About 6 months in, NPR did a whole thing on it that I heard one Sunday. They called it scrubbing (Similar to what op called it). There was way more stuff that I can’t recall at the moment. I kept what I wanted (not much) and donated a bunch to a local charity. The rest went to a thrift store donation bin."

My favorite children’s book will always be I love you to the moon and back. (I literally own like 5 versions of it). Take all the “she’s not normal / she needs therapy” advice to heart.
