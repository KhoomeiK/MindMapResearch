AskReddit,ffwsu4a,t1_ffwp787,1580310181.0,Most cars I see have it on the drivers...are you in the US?
AskReddit,ffwknxz,t1_ffvvbfj,1580304038.0,"My 04 Mustang didn't have this either.  But since it was on the wrong side of the car, I always remembered. Especially pulling into a busy station with lines at the pump and not being able to get in line because I'd be backwards from everyone else, and pumps around here don't have those super long hoses that will reach the other side of the car, like I've seen online.  

The gas door being on the passenger side was an immediate ""no"" for me when I was looking for a new car."
AskReddit,ffwje1n,t1_ffw1sdh,1580302938.0,"Anyone that's ever had a lot of barn cats would know too. Because full grown cats will suckle a nursing momma cat, **IF** she'll let them.

I've also seen grown cats suckle right alongside nursing puppies.   

I think the whole ""grown animals don't drink milk"" thing stems more from the lactating mother not letting them than from the animals not wanting it. But I'm not an expert."
mturk,ffukqos,t1_ffud5ez,1580244019.0,I figured.  Good thing it was only a dollar.

facepalm,fflyjak,t3_ety9e0,1580045779.0,"Definitely not as bad, but I did drop a coin into the coupon slot on one of those before."
tipofmytongue,ffj1bc9,t1_ffifu9e,1579987893.0,Solved! I showed him some of the trailers from the suggestions and he said this is it. Thanks!
tipofmytongue,ffiqq8b,t1_ffilgl2,1579980347.0,"Right?  I was interested in watching it, and we can't find it anywhere. Some of these are definitely similar sounding, but nothing looks right to him.  He's thinking he either imagined it, or it's an episode of something like some have mentioned."
tipofmytongue,ffig6ku,t1_ffid8bu,1579973099.0,Unsure honestly.  He's thinking maybe it's something he just imagined since we can't seem to find it lol.
tipofmytongue,ffig4s2,t1_ffie74k,1579973065.0,"He said that might possibly be it, and just remembered things wrong."

AskReddit,ff94y4l,t1_ff8bpde,1579704945.0,"It's weird, I really liked the show as it was coming out, but I've tried to watch reruns and it just gets on my nerves. All the characters are annoying and it's really not all that funny.  Idk what happened."
AskReddit,ff72nc9,t1_ff71tbo,1579639894.0,"Oh I do, but that doesn't stop then from screaming at you, or following you out the door saying ""MA'AM I **NEED** TO SEE YOUR RECEIPT""

It's happened to me twice, and I've witnessed it happening to others.  I know they're not *supposed* to do it, but they do, and you know damn well their management either makes them, or doesn't care how they handle it. I doubt corporate cares either."
AskReddit,ff71prd,t3_erzmpz,1579639377.0,"Walmart.  Gates inside the entrance that you can't exit out of, and really aggressive receipt checkers.  I've actually cut way back on Walmart trips over the last few months."
facepalm,ff6y0pj,t3_erxq4a,1579637220.0,Wouldn't the cashier have known that she didn't have change for a $20 before opening the register?
todayilearned,ff672dv,t1_ff5314o,1579620676.0,"Same, except mine was 8-3.  I thought that was how all schools operated until a few years ago.  We also didn't have different busses for different grades like they do now.   It makes no sense to me to take a whole trip for elementary school kids, then come back and do it again for middle, then again for high.  Seems like such a huge waste of fuel."
