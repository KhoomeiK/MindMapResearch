Some of the phrases she was using just sounded scripted and I don't buy it. Who starts falling for someone after one date?? I only buy it when the girl seems neurotic and clingy and like they are delusional themselves, I just don't see that with Victoria. It seems like it was a calculation to be saying that."
pregnant,ff9clp8,t3_esd02e,1579709962.0,"My husband took a bite of my dinner without asking, I almost bit his head off."
pregnant,ff658nz,t3_ersrys,1579619438.0,"I get really anxious about stuff too and I'm a generally un-exciteable person. Like it takes a lot. I'm only at like 5 weeks right now and I have a feeling when I start sharing I'm going to be expected to be a lot more excited than I am. I'm happy and I'm looking forward to having a little buddy, but I'm not sure I'm ""excited."" I'm mostly realistic that the pregnancy is going to be hard and the first couple of months with a baby sound terrible."
pregnant,ff43z5r,t3_erjn46,1579555028.0,"Do any of your friends have kids yet? I'm feeling pretty lonely too because I'm still a few weeks away from when I want to start sharing. It's just kind of isolating. I'm kind of avoiding hanging out in some cases too because I'm really bad at lying, but I really want to wait until my first prenatal appointment to give everyone the news. But if your friends know you're pregnant, I would just try to rekindle your relationship with them :) Make a point of seeing them on weeknights or something. I feel like women who have been through it love talking about and giving advice about being pregnant :)"
dogs,ff3rgjy,t1_f3lq2b1,1579547256.0,"Yes! I love the commands part of this. My dog is really high energy, but is also super food motivated and very obedient in the right circumstances. We have my niece (6 years old) and nephew (2) give her commands, too. They all LOVE it. It really helped build a bond between the kids and the dog."
instant_regret,ff372nn,t1_ff2fg6s,1579535239.0,"Ok cool, thanks so much for responding. That's what our trainer suggested with us, that our dog pretty much needs to walk 3 paces behind us and the idea is she needs to look to us for direction. I've been using ""come"" with a 6 to get her back walking if she's sniffing or distracted.  When she's distracted by a dog though it hasn't really been cutting it. She's a big dog haha we use a prong, too. It's too bad because she's a sweetheart at home but she looks like a terror with all her gear when I walk her. How long have you had your dog and been working with the e-collar? I'm getting to the point where I understand she's just never going to be easy, but I'm still hoping she can improve."
freefolk,ff1r8e2,t1_ff0tffq,1579484412.0,Don’t do it.
instant_regret,ff0rcyo,t1_ff0njuy,1579471585.0,The US. It could also be regional though. There is a really well respected balanced training facility in my city that a lot of us have used for our dogs. Our shelter will bring in trainers from that facility to do seminars for the volunteers. So it probably all goes hand in hand. They were lifesavers for me and my dog. I would have had to get rid of her because she was uncontrollable. And I’m sure she would have been euthanized if my husband and I didn’t get things figured out.
instant_regret,ff0pwbb,t1_fezqtiq,1579471188.0,"Some dogs are just opportunistic, they’re not interested in pleasing you if something else has their interest. Huskies and terriers are like this."
instant_regret,ff0peyw,t1_fezsuer,1579471017.0,"How did you use it for dog/leash reactivity? I see a lot of mixed information about using it as punishment/correction. Or do you work in a command so it’s a more of a “down. hey, you know down, you need to go into down.” We have the basics covered, recall, place, drop it that we did professional training for. But I really need it for leash reactivity and don’t want to use it the wrong way."
instant_regret,ff0mtpu,t1_ff0c8uv,1579470349.0,"I volunteer at a shelter. Many of us foster to adopt and use ecollar training for our pet dogs. It’s really a really well respected training tool at the shelter I volunteer at. Not all dogs need it of course, but for the tougher more headstrong dogs, it’s a great tool when used correctly. I’m having a baby soon and that’s what swayed me. My dog is young, big and excitable, she needs to listen to me all the time, not just when I have treats ready."
pregnant,fer11cb,t3_eq8ilq,1579348411.0,"Ours wasn’t planned exactly (we pulled the goalie and we’re completely shocked it happened as quickly as it did).,, I think I’m going to say “well, we weren’t not trying.”"
pregnant,feo21dy,t3_efk2ue,1579294114.0,"I'm the same way! I'm really stressing about it. What's a ""nice"" way to set boundaries about this? I'm not a confrontational person at all and it's freaking me out thinking about telling people to not post pictures of our baby."
fitpregnancy,feksf9k,t3_epig9n,1579206637.0,"Another question... I'm seeing a lot about trainers. I've been going to the same gym consistently for a few years, mostly light free weights and cardio, nothing crazy. Would you trust the staff at the gym to know about modifying workouts for pregnancy?"
reactivedogs,fekhvnf,t3_epil6z,1579200376.0,Thank you! We have a vet appointment coming up and if it doesn't go smoothly (our last one did not) I'm seriously considering switching vets.
Whatcouldgowrong,feil6cm,t3_ep47t7,1579141099.0,"In the biting picture the dog isn’t even THAT pissed, if he was there would be a lot more tension on his muzzle, and more of a snarl. This looks like she went to kiss him and it was literally his last resort to communicate to get away. Poor guy."
Messiah,fehwki0,t1_fehuf77,1579125293.0,"I think because they are so deeply unhappy in their own lives and to see someone bring any light or hope, they can't accept it. Especially when it's based purely on faith. Probably also the nature of their work is to be suspicious. I also noticed, they are both ""followers"" in their own way. They're both continuing to seek out Massih even though their bosses are telling them to fall back. I loved the part, where her counterpart from TX went home because he said he believes the message. I think that dynamic could get really interesting in future seasons."
pregnant,fehqssv,t1_fehlz9a,1579122025.0,"haha, yes, yes she will."
dogs,fehcku9,t3_ep51hq,1579113778.0,"It took me about 6 months. I remember at first I was a nervous wreck, she was very smart, but didn't listen and she was getting into everything. Extremely high energy with any change in environment, so it was tough to do stuff with her. And leash reactive ugh. (still is, but everything else has  calmed down). At around 6 months though I really felt like we were each others. I just felt like we'd deal with the ups and downs together and I'm just totally in love with her now. Give it time. I've had her for a little over 2 years now and I literally cannot imagine my life without her."
pregnant,feh8por,t1_fefi83s,1579111463.0,"yeah... the more I'm thinking about it I think I'm going to go this route, too. It would obviously be very sad for my husband and I if something happened in the next couple weeks, but I think my mom would be devastated if she found out I was pregnant and then I miscarried. I also don't trust her to keep a secret and I wouldn't feel comfortable having my whole extended family know if something went wrong."
pregnant,fef899p,t1_fef7xzw,1579050521.0,Thank you :)
IdiotsInCars,fcu17fx,t3_eiq30x,1577969074.0," I was driving through an intersection and a bus was stopped on the cross street, so the stop sign wasn’t visible to me. I stopped at my stop sign, looked for any kids, and continued. When I got across the street one of the mothers REEMED me out for not stopping. I didn’t think I did anything wrong, I’m in the US does anyone know the rule here?"
AmItheAsshole,fco0nuu,t3_ei40zr,1577821965.0,"NTA. My husband and I are in our early 30's and are not active on any social media now nor when we started dated. We both have friends here and there who don't have any social media profiles. It is the most FREEING thing. Social media has a way of causing a lot of miscommunication and awkwardness, I think. And I feel is filled with a lot of passive aggressive-ness, competitiveness, jealousy and toxicity. Stay strong, OP! She is definitely out there and you'll both be better for it!"
pitbulls,fclvk00,t1_fclspxr,1577757512.0,"Oh yeah, we’ve done TONS of professional training (group, private, rally obedience) :) I just always love learning more."
dogs,fcl7ykl,t3_ehq20f,1577741763.0,"Shake it off :) It sounds like you have a really sweet dog. The biggest thing I've learned by having a dog is that they're not going to be perfect all the time, and should be obvious, but they're animals. It also sounds like your whole family was really able to shake it off, too. Including your Aunt, although maybe didn't act totally appropriately, but maybe better than her cowering in fear. My dog actually had a similar reaction to one of my aunts who's just kind of a hippy cat lady... but we all ignored the dog and she warmed up after a little bit."
starterpacks,fckpogw,t1_fckkyfl,1577730496.0,"I lived in Portland for a year. I didn't notice anything like this. Yeah, the hipster thing was a little much at times. A lot of pet chickens, it felt a little smothering and quietly competitive. But people were SO nice. Almost too nice. I felt like I couldn't be myself.

Also I believe this is a west coast / east coast thing, but from my experience, there was no understanding of sarcasm, and not a lot of humor.

I moved back to Buffalo, NY and man I love how there is just zero hype here. People are just normal and have a good time."
reactivedogs,fcf73xk,t1_fcbae81,1577627203.0,"Just curious, I thought a read somewhere that some breeds are more in tune emotionally with their owners. My pit bull definitely mirrors how I’m feeling and if I’m anxious she’s anxious and acts out. The husky I grew up with is aloof and couldn’t care less how I’m feeling."
dogs,fc62cuj,t3_egd1xw,1577470696.0,This is going to seem really obvious. But they don't listen to you. At all.
dogs,fc3f2b1,t1_fc319sq,1577388382.0,"Is your husband open to trying a different method of training? It sounds like you've mostly tried positive (redirecting with food as a motivation). For some dogs, that only goes so far :( Like another poster said, it sounds like he is mouthy and obviously causing a lot of pain, but it sounds like he could literally kill if he wanted to and if his prey drive really was completely out of control, like you say, so he must have some inhibition. Please, before euthanasia, see if your husband will consider a balanced trainer that incorporates correction and  punishment. It seems like if there's any case for a dog that needs that, it would be this guy. I say this as a small woman (4'10"") who almost rehomed our dog, but this type of training has made a huge difference."
BalancedTraining,fc394ty,t1_f7yhkyv,1577384459.0,"How do you use it for reactivity? We bought the mini educator along with 4 sessions with a balanced trainer, but the training only covered recall, place and drop. I've really only been pairing the e-collar with commands and am not sure if it's ok to use it as a correction (or if using it for both would be confusing for the dog). Our trainer definitely wasn't encouraging it to be used as a correction. And so we're still at a standstill on reactivity. I started watching Take The Lead K9 Training and I liked it because it seemed to align with what I was already taught with the trainer.  Any other tips or resources would be appreciated!"
dogs,fc1m8hh,t1_fc1g63w,1577322994.0,"I volunteer at a shelter, and most of the pits are wonderful. But we did just get in a pit puppy (around 3 months) that is already exhibiting aggressive behavior towards dogs. I also have a pit bull that I rescued at a year old who’s got some dog-dog issues, we give her all the love and training that we can, but she’s never going to get along with dogs. It really bugs me when people say it’s the owner."
pitbulls,fc10bka,t1_fc0fprm,1577304612.0,Haha she’s not going to get the chance. She’s going to be tucked away in her crate until we can make sure there’s no candy laying around.
reactivedogs,fbhp162,t3_edf4ow,1576878952.0,"Before you jump to medication... have you done much training with him? I ask because I can think of a few things that might be helpful. Setting consistent boundaries is really helpful to avoid situations like that. Is he allowed on all the furniture? Maybe only allow him on one couch in particular so you each have your own space if you want it. Is he crate trained?  If he's growling at you, move him into his crate (I would probably lure him and not try to physically move him if he's growling), so he can chill out. For both of these, the ""place"" or stay command would be helpful so that he understands what you want. We taught my dog ""kennel"" and it's her most solid command, even if she's freaking out if we say kennel, she goes to her crate. It's super helpful because nothing escalates and she gets to take a breather.  It kind of sounds like to me he's just getting a little irritable over being touched when it's not on his terms. I would try these couple things first and see how it goes. Good luck!"
