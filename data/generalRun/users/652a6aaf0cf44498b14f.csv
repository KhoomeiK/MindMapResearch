programming,ffeecg5,t1_ffe8jlu,1579844853.0,">So you're saying when you soon up a service, you start with making sure it scales arbitrarily, before you ""make it work"", or ""solves a problem""?

Sort of? No piece of data is exposed soley in a presentation view. It must be exposed through a data structure devoid of any presentation information. External identifiers must uuids. Repository, service and controller logic must remain separate. Basically any design decision which restricts horizontal scaling is just silly."
tifu,ffedo5e,t3_et1aki,1579844190.0,"The difference between someone who can't grok computers and someone who can is the ability to eliminate possible causes. Take it as a lesson to think through how to isolate each problem. So in this case, plugging the monitor into something else you know works would have clued you into the source of the problem.

And even if you get stupid good at this kind of methodical diagnosis you will remain encumbered by your blind spots. Hence why ""rubber ducking"" is a thing.

Point being: good work. You struggled a lot and figured it out. That's all that matters :)"
television,ffectbc,t1_ffe4y7e,1579843376.0,No they're not chaotic neutral. They're mouth pieces for rich assholes who wear blue. Just like Fox news people are mouth pieces for rich assholes who wear red. Rich reds fights abortion rights to keep their voter populations up and veil it with religion while fucking over the poor. Rich blues fight immigration enforcement and veil it with anti-racist sentiments while fucking over the poor. There's one big club with two factions and we aren't in it.
programming,ffe5ygo,t1_ffanq1i,1579837577.0,">You're missing the ""vast majority of systems will never have that problem"" part. The easiest, fastest, and probably good enough solution is to use your favorite relational database, build your thing, and iterate from there. Eventually maybe your thing matters, and so you build up some redundancy.

I mean, I guess. It's really not that difficult for someone with the knowledge. And if they don't have the knowledge they're basically building a production system as an educational exercise. At some point we're going to have to graduate beyond that kind of thing."
programming,ffcmqy2,t1_ffclx3s,1579802753.0,"Nobody's saying there isn't any real innovation happening. Unfortunately it's really easy to fake it depending on what it's being applied to. Nearly everybody on the planet has experience visually identifying objects so they're all well qualified to evaluate if a camera they're holding in their hand is doing it correctly.

It gets a bit fuzzier and shadier for ""predictive"" stuff. There's a lot of variables at play which can muck with your answers. Say they accidentally provided images of dogs after they were adopted and the process was to do some grooming, take the picture and then deliver to the owner. Now you have an algorithm that's optimized to identify the color of the table the dog is placed on just before they're handed off to the owner. Discovering these kinds of issues as some random third party isn't possible because it requires too much depth.

EDIT: Felt like expanding a bit. Basically there are two ways to use ML responsibly. You have data and the result given by the ML algorithm after processing that data. Results which can be evaluated with a high degree of objectivity are easy to use responsibly like the camera example. Subjective results generated from data with a high degree of objectivity are a little more difficult because you need to confirm the result using classical means. Think of these as search results. A lot of them aren't going to be what you're looking for but it can eliminate a lot of wrong answers. Think algorithms predicting heart disease based on DNA. The data involved doesn't leave a lot of room for bias based on how it was gathered. Plus, you use the results to influence areas of further research using classical approaches.

Any time ML is used for subjective datasets to produce subjective results should set off alarms and red flags that the individuals involved are either under qualified or con artists."

programming,ff9ney3,t1_ff8nufg,1579716645.0,">if two pieces of information are dependent on each other, they should belong to a single server.

I gotta wonder about the experience of anybody who writes something like this. Every piece of information you store is dependent on another piece of information. City is dependent on address is dependent on order is dependent on customer is dependent on... whatever. Yes, accessing all that information from one source would be simpler but eventually it isn't possible. At some point you start operating on a scale where you can't serve all this information from a single server because a single server cannot be optimized for the thousand disparate use cases of that information.

So you create ways of distributing that information to multiple servers each being optimized for the particular use case."

And that's really why I can't take PHP defenders seriously. At some point you're carrying around so much dead weight... and for what? If PHP is as easy to work with in the modern day as anything else then spend the effort to make it something you call from a more modern language that stood on the shoulders of PHP. Stop making people today deal with decisions made decades ago."
Bitcoin,ff7tcbd,t3_es38af,1579657869.0,Is it a seed? You can probably eliminate a lot of the possibilities based on the length of the word or something. Should shave down possibilities further. Then figure out how to get a computer cluster to hammer at it for a few hours. Make sure you log what ranges you try so you can exclude them from future attempts should the first few fail.

UpliftingNews,ff7qw2s,t1_ff6q0h2,1579656165.0,"Same. I really wish we'd drop it. I remember my parents arguing about this shit 20+ years ago and nothing has changed. Meanwhile it's been used successfully as a wedge issue which has allowed much more serious issues causing much higher (although admittedly less grotesque) death tolls. Lack of health insurance, lack of housing and lack of criminal justice reforms are the cause of more deaths every year. When we solve those things I'll happily participate in a discussion about gun rights. And no, we can't ""do both"" because if we could, we would have."
