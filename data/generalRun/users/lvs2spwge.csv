My ex did the same thing and made me out to be the bad guy the entire time she was breaking up with me, which almost seemed amusing to her; she even laughed. Once I tried to tell her my side and where she had done things wrong, she stormed out and said she felt like she was, ""being attacked."" Even though she just broke my heart, somehow it was my fault. You're not alone OP. I feel you, dude."
RDR2,fcoaruy,t3_ei7qzk,1577827686.0,"It has to be a bug. Ever since the, ""updates,"" things have gotten worse. Literally right now, some guy chased me and i tried to engage him in a fist fight, but Arthur keeps pulling out his fucking gun and it turns into a shootout. So of course i kill them and defend myself, but I get the fucking wanted level. The cops just stand around and don't do shit either."

My Mom had a bush, but I also was exposed to pornos and magazines as a kid, so I never thought they were all the same. Then again, I didn't know they were different either.

I was lucky enough to have a sex ed class in elementary school. I grew up in an area where young pregnancy was commonplace, so the school system figured by exposing us at an earlier age, we would understand sooner."
offmychest,fc4ugon,t1_fc4u6h9,1577428882.0,"Omfg, lol. I grew up with WWF, as well. Trish Stratus has always been a babe. Amongst the many other Divas.

My Mom walked around naked too, but I never associated that all women looked that way. I'm genuinely curious if religion was a factor for you. No judgement whatsoever if it was though. Half of my family were Jehovah's witnesses.

How did you discover a shaved one? Porno mag?"
offmychest,fc4tzk1,t3_eg43af,1577428357.0,I can't help but to laugh at the situation. How sheltered was your upbringing? Like no internet and t.v. or were there fine lines of outside information?
