>Justice Stewart, the Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment does not require an opportunity for a hearing prior to the nonrenewal of a nontenured state teacher's contract, unless he can show that the nonrenewal deprived him of an interest in ""liberty"" or that he had a ""property"" interest in continued employment, despite the lack of tenure or a formal contract.

Why does Justice Stewart say “unless he can show...that he had a property interest” when clearly he had a salary, so why was that questioned?

Justice Marshall wrote a separate dissent saying that ""every citizen who applies for a government job is entitled to it unless the government can establish some reason for denying the employment.""

> In late December 1944, with Yalta looming, Roosevelt and Groves met in the Oval Office (along with Henry Stimson, the Secretary of War). In Groves’ much later recollection (so we can make of that what we will), Roosevelt asked if the atomic bomb might be ready to use against Germany very soon. Groves explained that for a variety of reasons, the most important one being that their schedule had pushed the bomb back to the summer of 1945, this would not be possible. It is an interesting piece, one that simultaneously reveals Roosevelt’s potential willingness to use the atomic bomb as a first-strike weapon, his willingness to use it against Germany specifically, and the fact that FDR was sufficiently out of the loop on planning discussions to not know that this would both be impossible and very difficult. In other words, it reveals that FDR wasn’t aware that by that point, it was expected that the bomb could only be used against Japan, and that is a rather large thing for him not to know — further evidence, perhaps, that he was not completely abreast of these kinds of discussions. 

> Would Roosevelt have dropped the bomb on Japan, had he not died? I suspect the answer is yes. One can see, in these brief data points, a mind warming up to the idea of the atomic bomb as not just a deterrent, but a weapon, one that might be deployed as a first-strike attack. In some ways, FDR’s query to Groves about Germany is the most interesting piece: this was a step further than anyone else at the time was really making, since Germany’s defeat seemed inevitable at that point. But, again, the strict answer is, of course, that we can’t really know for sure.

At the time he denied any business in Russia. Good to know you agreed he was lying. 

And in terms of stealing an election, the GOP was well versed in rigging the election which Trump overwhelmingly lost the popular vote and win by a tiny margin in a few states. 

Trump was working with the Russians through Wikileaks as documented in the Stone trial. Manafort, his campaign manager was handing voter information to the Russians. The Russians had a spy in the NRA and were putting money into the campaign through that. Trump changed the GOP policy on Ukraine and was pushing to remove sanctions which he did for a Putin connected oligarch. Members of his campaign team met with the Russian ambassador and lied about it to the FBI. For someone “not working with the Russians” he sure was working with the Russians.
