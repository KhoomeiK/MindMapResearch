TalkTherapy,fgidvfa,t3_ey0bdj,1580818297.0,I have both spilled an alarming amount of coffee on the wall of my T's office and stopped up the toilet with too much toilet paper!  I still continued therapy with him despite being embarrassed because he was the best therapist I ever had.
TalkTherapy,fgidrly,t1_fghn71f,1580818179.0,"I highly doubt it was accidental.  I do not look forward to those moments when I become a therapist, lol"
SuicideWatch,fg4pgi9,t3_ewoyes,1580508196.0,Sounds like you may have some social anxiety.  My boyfriend also hates his bday and gets a little too in his head about it.  Be kind to yourself.  If your friends didn't like you they wouldn't have put in effort to celebrate your b-day.
rape,fg4p3ae,t3_ewsidl,1580507968.0,"Thank you for sharing your story with us and reiterating that rape is not always the way we expected.  Ten years later I still have trouble calling it rape but I keep doing so in order to fight against my tendency to minimize.  I was really sad to see the ""consent explained by tea"" video because I felt like it didn't include something close enough to my situation.  Since my therapist told me to watch it did that mean she didn't think I was raped despite her reassurance that I was?  It's thoughts like these that put you in a dark place.  I'm sorry for what you went through but I'm also as proud as you can be of a stranger for telling it so honestly and bravely."

ENFP,fexjq8s,t1_fexg1mt,1579432099.0,"Girls in their 20s sometimes don't really know what they want.  Be honest with her that you feel teased.  Let her know she can have your friendship but if she's not interested in a relationship, she needs to respect friendship boundaries.  I was the girl in this scenario with my current boyfriend.  For the better part of 10 years, I tortured him this way... unintentionally.  Now he is the best thing in my life and I'm so glad he accepted me back.  Perspective comes with age/growth."
ENFP,feo3usd,t3_epzxz8,1579294739.0,How does one know if they are around another ENFP?  Is everyone asking people their MB personality?  Lol.  Social anxiety sucks but it's likely that the people you are anxious around are feeling similarly about themselves.
ENFP,feo2uyr,t1_fenlpf5,1579294375.0,r/askatherapist is a good subreddit.  r/talktherapy is also good.
therapy,femdulu,t1_fem3tm4,1579250401.0,To fully cope with an event in my past in order to be of service to my own clients in the future.  I'm starting my Master's in Clinical Mental Health Counseling next week.
therapy,fem196f,t3_eppfik,1579236490.0,I find it useful to tell my therapist what my goals are.  Come to therapy with a goal in mind because you are the one in charge.  Tell her to help redirect you if you get caught up in only talking about the current weekly issues if what you really want to focus on is something bothering you more.
TalkTherapy,felyxp6,t3_epp8xc,1579234538.0,"I'm sorry that happened to you.  When I told my male therapist that I was experiencing ""romantic transference"" feelings for him, he agreed it was normal but didn't seem to think we needed to discuss it further.  I kind of wish he had worked through it with me but at least he didn't tell me he wasn't going to see female patients anymore!  That's horrible.  I really hope you give therapy another chance but I know it's hard to start with someone new.  I started with a new therapist online and I think it was a little easier because of the distance a computer screen provides."
TalkTherapy,felyn07,t1_felwb4q,1579234302.0,That's a really great analogy!
