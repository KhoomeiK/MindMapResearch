worldnews,fft1e22,t1_ffsy1is,1580201871.0,Fairly sure studies have shown that longer shifts are better for patient outcomes since there’s less staff turnover and less opportunity for information to get lost in the shuffle
AskReddit,ffsyovg,t1_ffsxqoe,1580198096.0,"Lol what? I’m extremely nice to patients, as is basically every nurse I know. I’m talking about the dickheads who literally assault healthcare works and verbally berate us. No one who works in healthcare doesn’t have a dark sense of humor about the whole thing. It’s either people dying in awful ways, or people being assholes. No one can tolerate that without finding a way to vent about it."

todayilearned,ffstf8z,t1_ffrtuvo,1580191800.0,"It’s a talking point of people too lazy to take the time to actually look for healthy food

Chicken, tuna, brown rice, frozen veggies, eggs, yogurt, beans, etc are all dirt cheap"

todayilearned,ffssr22,t1_ffryj4x,1580191103.0,"I’m a dude who is 5’10” and 170. I have pretty decent muscle (gym 4-5 times a week) but still have some fat around my stomach so no abs or anything. I’ve had so much people tell me I’m way too skinny and that 170 is basically underweight. 

People really think the average dude should weigh 200 pounds. It’s absurd. I could drop down to 150 and be a completely healthy weight for my height"
todayilearned,ffssg3y,t1_ffseq2h,1580190793.0,Just drink fucking water. My god
TooAfraidToAsk,ffs2lf3,t1_ffs0zc2,1580171591.0,"You can just as easily say all the bad stuff are distractions from being happy 

It means nothing. Life is what you make of it"
TooAfraidToAsk,ffrwy9n,t1_ffru0bv,1580167753.0,What? There are things that make us happy and things that don’t make us happy. Of fucking course if we remove things that make us happy we won’t be happy

nba,ffr1il7,t1_ffqvi0c,1580148410.0,Biggest death that didn’t involve a politician maybe. Though Michael Jackson is arguable. As well as John Lennon

gatekeeping,ffqve3o,t1_ffqbinr,1580144508.0,Well I think it’s way more fun so that was my reason
nba,ffqqibs,t1_ffqq46l,1580141290.0,"Yes it is. 10% of really really really low. I doubt even a quarter of the league is at 10 or below. Lebron likely sits at around 10-12 and he’s shredded. Zion is likely in the 15-20 range 

I don’t even know why you’re mad about this. 15-20 is still pretty damn good. He just obviously not 10% to anyone who knows anything about body fat"
nba,ffqq6nh,t1_ffp7jra,1580141071.0,Endomorph is not real science dude
nba,ffqq13g,t1_ffp8384,1580140968.0,"It’s absolutely a crazy unbelievable number

Just because you have no idea how body fat works doesn’t make it so"
nfl,ffqp26r,t1_ffqmkp6,1580140307.0,Tons of people only watch their team play. I’d argue that’s the majority of fans tbh
nba,ffpr1qq,t1_ffocvuw,1580102680.0,"Senna, Dale Earnhardt, Roy Halladay, and Clemente are probably the most comparable"
