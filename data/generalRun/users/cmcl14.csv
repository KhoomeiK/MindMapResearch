educationalgifs,ffijpul,t1_ffihggy,1579975503.0,I'm assuming the video was made for Americans. Why should they include metric when it will just confuse people? It's okay for Americans to produce things for their own audience.
ContagiousLaughter,ffdxucz,t1_ffdtie0,1579831620.0,What?
nonononoyes,ffbaeny,t1_ffauqc6,1579757329.0,Also in Bocce you can throw.
MapPorn,ff54a5k,t3_erm2vj,1579579821.0,What are the colours?
MapPorn,ff544x0,t1_ff2k0er,1579579708.0,I'm from western Canada and had the same experience. Saw my first one in New Jersey in 2018.
ContagiousLaughter,ff53ts7,t1_ff3kodk,1579579469.0,"Yeah, I didn't give my kids ice cream until they were three, and even then only because it was basically unavoidable. It's hard to imagine giving ice cream to a baby this age, but I guess it's all cultural."
interestingasfuck,fdx5iu8,t1_fdwyljh,1578765534.0,Haha thanks.
interestingasfuck,fdwwcig,t1_fdwtn24,1578762926.0,Uh... Can you elaborate on the last part?
todayilearned,fdqjosx,t1_fdociv0,1578668317.0,Interesting. Many Ukrainian Canadians have a -ski at the end of their name. Is this just a difference in how they romanized the Cyrillic letters when they came here? Or are they likely ethnic Poles from Ukraine?
todayilearned,fdqjfuk,t1_fdpgsp0,1578668149.0,I get my groceries delivered by the grocery store each week. I'm convinced it produces less emissions because the truck probably delivers to 30 people in one big loop rather than us all driving to the store and back home.
todayilearned,fdpmdbg,t1_fdpk9zw,1578632716.0,Where in India are you from? I'm sure it varies a lot. My relatives in Tamil Nadu are all pure vegetarians as is their whole community / caste.
MapPorn,fdpm90o,t1_fdp8ar6,1578632611.0,Nothings perfect... Appreciate the effort. It's an important map.
todayilearned,fdpk5oi,t1_fdow1am,1578630849.0,Compared to the west it's very high.
worldnews,fdklkix,t1_fdk89tp,1578506064.0,"I'm sure that's true.  All I originally said was it's the same ""type rating"" which is also true.  Let's both be right here."
dashcamgifs,fdkkm50,t1_fdkbi1f,1578505548.0,This must be different in different areas because here in Vancouver they absolutely roost together at night.
dashcamgifs,fdkkhz9,t1_fdk22z8,1578505491.0,Yes! We watch this with my kids over the west end every night. We say the crows are going to their meeting.
worldnews,fdk2eba,t1_fdk0t0j,1578494379.0,They are the same according to the FAA: http://registry.faa.gov/TypeRatings/
worldnews,fdj99gw,t1_fdj2sq4,1578462155.0,"I mean, they're not entirely different–they're so similar that they have the same type rating.  But yeah, the -800 doesn't have MCAS, and has a stellar safety record, so pretty hard to see how it could fall out of the sky like this."
worldnews,fdj8xaj,t1_fdj53sh,1578461855.0,It's a regularly scheduled flight.  People travel.
worldnews,fdj3ojt,t3_elnmhu,1578457600.0,There's no evidence it was shot down in the article.
MapPorn,fdfb5m2,t1_fdf3jcq,1578357556.0,"I wasn't saying it was *my* assumption, I was inferring that it was the assumption behind statements that majority minority districts are desirable because without them minorities would not be represented. Saying that suggests that a minority will only achieve representation if they are able to elect someone from the same minority, which, like you, I don't believe is the case."
MapPorn,fddtjd7,t1_fddkwud,1578323602.0,"Thanks! Not sure why I was downvoted, but I really appreciate the nuance all over this thread.  I'm from Canada and our districts are drawn based on only population and some adherence to historical communities, but not ethnicity, so I was trying to find out more."
MapPorn,fdd0w57,t1_fdckqct,1578290417.0,The assumption here being that people will only vote for someone of their own race? Or that only a Hispanic can represent Hispanics? Seems to be a pretty cynical viewpoint.
MapPorn,fdd0e4f,t1_fdcjynf,1578289878.0,"I think they officially have names and numbers, much like school divisions. For example, County of Wetaskiwin No. 10."
MapPorn,fdd0az8,t1_fdcfww7,1578289794.0,"Every Canadian I've met calls it The Yukon. But you're right, it's not correct."
MapPorn,fda165i,t3_ekdobw,1578240485.0,Are those circles supposed to be the same size? I'm pretty sure circles don't appear circular on a Mercator projection.
MapPorn,fda035w,t3_ekebz5,1578240136.0,Doesn't seem to match the source: https://www.internationalsos.com/risk-outlook
MapPorn,fd9zn2u,t3_ekebz5,1578239978.0,What's the other green dot in Europe? Slovenia?
MapPorn,fd5kdsq,t1_fd5ho7y,1578178480.0,Also Philippines.
worldnews,fd01haj,t1_fczzk4k,1578112227.0,Yeah... The article actually supports the specific thing Pence claims while it's tone tries to discredit him.

educationalgifs,fcsj3qf,t1_fcs9em7,1577917526.0,">maybe they'd chill and mind their own business for once.

Hahahahahahahahahaha."
educationalgifs,fcsj0ag,t1_fcsfe95,1577917455.0,Because there are way more changes earlier on you need more space for those weeks.
todayilearned,fc7p2od,t1_fc7mlev,1577514836.0,I was thinking more about how many there are in a given city.
trashy,fc7lp1y,t1_fc7k2df,1577511508.0,Dude has a bottle of Stella Artois.
todayilearned,fc7lhui,t1_fc7lcdi,1577511311.0,Easier to repaint if faded.

MapPorn,fc0r1u1,t1_fc0lta0,1577297552.0,"I guess you could use a paperclip to scratch out your actual path of travel? I dunno seems pretty normal to just say ""I've been to Spain"" if you've been inside the country."
