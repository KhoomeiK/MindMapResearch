TrueOffMyChest,ff6677w,t1_ff65htx,1579620097.0,Thank you for caring about a random stranger on the internet. The fact that you thought about me long after you read my post means so much.
TrueOffMyChest,ff66266,t1_ff5zc0c,1579620003.0,"I am definitely following my treatment regimen of medication and therapy. Anyone that tells depressed people to “just be happy,” or to “think more positively,” or “you need to try yoga” is an absolutely awful person."
TrueOffMyChest,ff65e9g,t1_ff64htq,1579619545.0,"It really does feel nice to make so much progress. It’s amazing that people are being so kind to me about this. I keep getting emotional about it, because when I made my first post I didn’t even expect anyone to care. Thank you for your kind words"
TrueOffMyChest,ff654ot,t1_ff64qnu,1579619362.0,Thank you. I hope things improve for you too
TrueOffMyChest,ff5xcs2,t1_ff5t186,1579613371.0,"Thank you, I’m going to do everything I can to keep going"
TrueOffMyChest,ff54f5d,t1_ff53hew,1579579931.0,"Thank you! That means a lot to me :) It’s not easy, but it certainly helps me feel better"
TrueOffMyChest,ff5041f,t1_ff501d8,1579576668.0,"Oh, I have a therapist, I mentioned her in my post. I’m working on getting better, don’t worry :)"
TrueOffMyChest,ff4yp0h,t1_ff4yfud,1579575644.0,Thank you so much! I’m shocked by how much better I feel. I’m going to do my best and keep going :)
TrueOffMyChest,ff4xklb,t3_ero5ej,1579574859.0,"Thank you for the gold, whoever did that! I’ve never had that before!"
blackfishing,fet44nl,t3_eqa2q7,1579371656.0,"“White passing” is a great way to completely invalidate lighter skinned people of color, who can be made to feel as though they don’t fit in with white people or fellow people of color. Fuck that. All that does is make you feel like you can’t explore your own heritage, and leaves you without a place to feel like you belong. 

Reminds me of how fellow LGBTQ+ people tell bisexuals saying they’re “straight passing,” which just further contributes to bi-erasure. You do you, and embrace your culture and your heritage."
TrueOffMyChest,fem0rg4,t1_fem0p7w,1579236061.0,Why would your family be mad at you for telling the truth? If you need to DM me you can. I’m sorry things went poorly for you :(
