australia,fdj2hkt,t1_fdgw9m5,1578456733.0,"Yeah I get you but they like being treated more  ‘equal’ so what you’re saying is directly threatening their way of life, hence the downvotes. 

I’m all for a centre government but the left won’t rest until everyone accepts everything the left has to offer instead of just the good items and the right won’t rest until they’ve raped the earth to death and wait for god to fix it all, both sides have good and bad but people that have been sucked into identity politics only agree 100% with their chosen side. 

It’s sad to see and you can see it here in the downvotes and the woke people putting us in our place.."

Someone is a narcissist and hilariously, it’s OP. Honestly I hope this is trolling because if he actually believe anything he says or thinks he has any leverage with anyone... wow.. just wow, :)"
