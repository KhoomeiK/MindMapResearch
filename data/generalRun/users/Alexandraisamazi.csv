leopardgeckos,ffpixd2,t3_eugaod,1580096141.0,"My gecko has bitten me a few times. Mostly because when I first adopted her, I decided to feed her from my hand. Thinking she will see my hand as a good thing. Instead she saw my hand as a bringer of food and bit me because she was expecting there to be food."
funnysigns,ffjwx99,t1_ffjhhyk,1580009202.0,"I wish I remember the island I was on. It’s deemed “the worlds most dangerous airport” due to having a short runway. Also, it was funny to see people fly because they were too close. A lot of people lost towels and umbrellas."
AskReddit,ffh3pxt,t3_etfl5h,1579922280.0,"I work retail. After a customer screamed at me and left, the next one came up. A super sweet older couple, they said, “Sweetie, you are doing just fine. We can tell that you are trying your best. Now, just breathe for a second for me and then after you calm down, I would like to return my sweater.”  I was almost in tears from the previous customer, and their sweet and kind words helped me make it through the day."
leopardgeckos,ffftf4b,t1_fffrrzp,1579891405.0,"Thank you. The urate is the same as it’s been. She’s up and about like normal, demanding more food. I’ll keep an eye on it. Worst case scenario we make a trip to her vet."
foodscam,ffdjo6e,t1_ffdf4fv,1579822298.0,I think in general they should have to be 100% honest. Not just for allergies but also from the standpoint that people should know what they are getting.
redneckengineering,ffbra1c,t3_esnxvf,1579779617.0,"Can you steer it, or does this car now travel exclusively in straight lines?"
TalesFromRetail,ff998z0,t1_ff95rm2,1579707768.0,"Account look up with her drivers license. She had a store card, if you have a credit account with us and you forget your card, we can look it up using your drivers license and social security number."

Koi,ff7kooe,t3_erxh7f,1579651830.0,"You have some very cute koi, judging by your other posts. How deep does your pond have to be in order to keep from freezing the koi? (I live in the Midwest and would love to have a koi pond."
StupidFood,ff5e37w,t3_erghsg,1579588982.0,I get having milkshake. I understand blending in a cake into the milkshake. (One product) What I don’t understand is why the hell you would put a whole cake on top of a milkshake and expect someone to eat/drink that monstrosity.
AskReddit,ff532to,t1_ff2to2u,1579578892.0,"These are helpful to those of us who feel like we are negative one. I’ve been depressed lately, and I feel like I’m unintentionally dragging my partner through the storm with me. It’s helpful to be able to see the other side of things and know what I should do to help my partner not feel what I’m feeling."
ResinCasting,ff4zrio,t1_ff4y4c4,1579576411.0,"Not op, but a fellow resin artist. If not dried properly, yes it will rot. I dry flowers in my oven. The oven isn’t on, I just turn on the light and let the subtle heat created by the light dry out rose petals. I’ve seen people try to resin food, and it never goes well. Decay will happen if you don’t do something to prevent it. Hope this helps!"
TalesFromYourServer,ff24ikv,t3_er53go,1579493587.0,"I have a genuine question. Is it ok for people to do this?
C1: “I want a steak medium, with these sides”
C2: “I want the same thing, but the steak cooked medium rare.”

Sides and sizes of everything else is the same, just the rareness is different. I just want to know what’s acceptable and what will make people mad."
CustomerService,fepkchz,t3_eq7feb,1579322750.0,"If you are a customer, what you should do, in my opinion, is to contact corporate. Most large companies have a large corporate call center that takes complaints like this. The only person above regional is district manager, who aren’t usually around all that often. I would take a minute, breathe, and think on if this issue is worth escalating this high up. Maybe it was a misunderstanding? (I say this because a lot of “big” issues can be solved by just listening to the employees who are trying to help you)

Without knowing what the issue is and without being there I can’t really offer a whole lot in resolving the situation. Maybe go into the store in person and resolve this.

Source: I work in customer service

Edit: I’m not trying to sound like a jerk or anything. I just genuinely want to help you solve the problem and get into contact with who you need."

YouShouldKnow,fekfu94,t3_epgcr8,1579199160.0,"Thank you so much! Earlier last year this happened to me. I received 20 unordered packages. Some electronics and some random stuff like vases. I asked my entire family who sent it, no one. They used my full name, which is unique as my name is hard to spell, my address, and all my info. Amazon did research. 7 accounts that weren’t mine were made in my name. I had to change the email on my real account so amazon didn’t delete it by accident. They all used my name and my debit card info, though my debit card was never charged. 10/10 scary. I’m so glad that I’m not alone in this really stupid issue."
foodscam,fekfcnu,t3_epk9oc,1579198868.0,"Anytime I go to a seafood restaurant with my mom, she always asks if they use real crab meat in the crab cakes. The default answer is yes, then she says “I’m allergic to imitation crab. Can you double check that it’s 100% real.” They check with the chef and tell us the answer. Sometimes it’s a yes is real, sometimes it’s fake. My mother is severely allergic to fish, not shellfish. She can eat crab, lobster, shrimp, no issue. If she has fish her throat swells and she breaks out in hives. Even if you don’t have an allergy, they should legally have to tell you if it’s fake or not if you ask."

RantsFromRetail,fefsjoz,t3_eomxri,1579063910.0,"This, and also when they call wanting to know if you have a super common item in stock and want you to grab it and put it on hold. Then they get mad when you tell them it will be a minute because you are literally ringing someone out. I can’t even. Either come in the dang store and look around or shop online. We do not offer a shop over the phone service."
leopardgeckos,fe48tjy,t1_fe47u8d,1578856892.0,I wish you the best! I’ve been very lucky with my Leo as far as being chill and not picky goes. I got her to come to me by feeding mealworms out of my hands. Though she did mistake me for food and has bitten accidentally. Best wishes to you and the Leo. Hopefully time helps.

dogs,fdmab9h,t1_fdm9zkg,1578543787.0,Thank you. It’s hard. Going over to my parents house is going to be hard to do for awhile. It’s going to feel empty. I just know that he isn’t in pain anymore.

awwnverts,fdcmz8j,t3_ekl3fu,1578278929.0,I never thought I’d find a bug fascinating and cute. Then I’ve seen your posts about Orchid mantises and I may get into insects when I have more space. They are a lot cooler than I thought. Thank you for opening my eyes to a new realm of insect friends.

razer,fbz9zy3,t1_f9f709i,1577239779.0,My new Naga Trinity will NOT sync to the synapse. I don’t know why. There isn’t a button to add a device. I registered the warranty with my account. I don’t know what to do. I just want everything to sync and nothing is working. My keyboard is on the synapse but it won’t let me add the dang mouse.
