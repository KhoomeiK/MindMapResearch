Sometimes I do it in the kitchen while cooking something and just waiting.

That said, I actually do enjoy trying to push for new records. That first pull up will feel amazing and I've gotten to 22 push ups in a row so far (my previous records never even reached 15).

New year event gave us lots of extra feathers, free POs, free gold, free monster materials. Due to Christmas stockings and free POs, I was able to use 80 POs at this event on a very new, F2P account.

CNY event let us invite any hero we want. There are 30 more feathers from fireworks. Inviting 2 heroes gives an extra Garuda.

With feathers and 3 free copies of Garuda, getting 5 copies of Garuda is almost guaranteed.

I did get lucky though. I got one copy from my 80 POs and another cpoy out of elite hero shards. I would need to wait a bit longer to get more feathers to 10-star him if not for that luck. But OP only needed 1 copy out of POs or elite shards."

But really, it just meant that F2P players lose all choice. They *have* to build Valk or they will actually never get off the ground.

Having a random hero that is too strong is not good for the game. However, I'm not so sure Garuda really is *that* strong. She is strong, yes, but there are a lot more options in early game. You can basically choose any faction and there's a good hero in there to start with.

IdleHeroes,ff9q5z6,t1_ff9pwba,1579718498.0,It's not.
fatlogic,ff9kxmc,t1_ff9jje2,1579715178.0,"I'm 6 feet tall and man I was so sad when the person in front of me reclined all the way back. I honestly think they should remove that from the chairs.

It was a 12 hour flight.

Luckily, at some point when food was brought, the attendant asked that they bring the seat up when eating and they never reclined it after that. Whew!"
spikes,ff9jw6g,t1_ff6srty,1579714566.0,"I honestly compare it to that viashino guy (viashino pyromancer?). The 2/1 that burns the enemy's face for 2 on ETB. 2/2 haste is actually a pretty similar card, just a good bit worse when there's a 2-power blocker on the other side since you might lose that initial 2 damage where the other card you get your 2, then you can clear the way for when it actually swings.

There's just a ton of text on this mythic rare that is irrelevant for that job so it makes the card stand out, but it's actually still not bad to include in RDW. Just remember you are basically running a 2/2 with haste, so it's only really a common in terms of power level lol"
spikes,ff9jknw,t1_ff9j7by,1579714376.0,"Ya I have the same assessment. I think it is much better if you can mill it or discard it. I think a control deck will ignore the 3/4.

Even if it was just a 4/4 so it could punch through the 0/4 walls they make and draw you a card off of the new wrath it would be a significant upgrade."
spikes,ff9g3zw,t3_escyyy,1579712278.0,"I've been trying to use [[pharika's spawn]]. It's clunky but I feel like it's actually a borderline playable card already. Makes them sac it so beats the hexproof and you can recast almost indefinitely since the dream trawler decks tend to be grindy control matchups.

I don't think it will be the best option but something to consider if on a budget or just in general. Pretty easy to slam one into a deck with a bit of self mill or looting effects.

I think I'm just hyped on this card for no reason at all lol"
fatlogic,ff9c90p,t1_ff9bewz,1579709696.0,"Thanks for this. I find it so frustrating when people say ""X has no physical addiction therefore it is not addictive"".

I guess gambling, sex, and gaming all cannot be addictive either then. There's literally no substance to get addicted to.

It's just applying a stupid semantics thing. IMO, addiction vs physical addiction is the only distinction there should be. It's clear what they mean that way."
MagicArena,ff98098,t1_ff7l1q8,1579706969.0,"I agree. Let the user choose the graveyard option. I don't think the graveyard option is the main option to use, anyway. Having it switch arbitrarily will only lead to players making mistakes due to confusion. Even if you want to go after the graveyard, you still want to see their hand first."
MagicArena,ff96599,t1_ff8f5sh,1579705754.0,"IIRC vigilance only became a keyword on modern cards. Maybe Kamigawa block?

Onslaught was the last block printed with the old card frames and [[mobilization|ONS]] from that set has the same wording as this wombat."
IdleHeroes,ff9398n,t3_es49z2,1579703772.0,"For day 10-15 I am fighting teams with E5 Penny. Almost every team there has E5 Penny. Just today, I got E5 Aida, E5 Penny, E2 Garuda, and E3 Ramen at day 15.

My team has 4 E5s in it so I am pretty strong but there was already multiple teams with an E5 on them before it, so my team wears down.

I wiped against day 15 and I realize I will have to win every single brave trial to day 15 to get any worthy reward so I'm saving my tokens, hoping DH will update it again."
IdleHeroes,ff92uyv,t3_es9k0y,1579703490.0,"I would save, considering you are F2P and don't need Garuda. 4k gems is a much smaller price to pay than 550 HS."
MagicArena,ff92m7a,t1_ff92dbl,1579703318.0,"True. And from what I have read in these comments, OP has something like a 150 card deck lol a 1-of will barely make a difference in terms of how they draw."
MagicArena,ff9258o,t1_ff7r5a6,1579702977.0,I mean in any other sort of game. I don't think OP's match is worth building around and OP has an out if it's somehow a total board stall via a huge hydra. A 64/65 trample will suffice in 99.9999% of games lol
IdleHeroes,ff922gl,t1_ff7cu9n,1579702919.0,"Ya for sure. I think the best way to describe Valk is that she is like tier 3 as a first carry, where penny and horus are tier 1, garuda and cthugha are tier 2 (due to lack of seal land progress), and everyone other than these 5 are garbage tier.

So... not the best option, but at least an option in a dire situation, like you get unlucky with everything but have a ton of valk copies. Seems like DH has made her more available now as well (she was in shelter and campaign)."
IdleHeroes,ff74q82,t1_ff70x84,1579641085.0,"If you build E5 Horus with a little support, you can get SL18. Just one E5 EZPZ. At that point, it is still less of an investment to get SL20 in fortress than it is to get SL20 in shadow. You don't even need to regress your Horus. You will still be closer to fortress SL20 than shadow SL20.

To beat SL20 in shadow it takes like 4 E5 heroes."
IdleHeroes,ff73p9z,t1_ff73i7e,1579640497.0,"Very true! Though Cthugha is quite good and Valk is probably passable. You at least will get far in Aspen dungeon and do decently in PVP.

I am trying out Cthugha on my F2P alt and he is kicking butt."
IdleHeroes,ff6zg1x,t1_ff6wxbm,1579638055.0,"Good point. I think just for the first E5 if nothing else, it is best to rush it without really considering support for them."
MagicArena,ff6u2nu,t1_ff6qgg1,1579634893.0,"This particular game is probably not worth building around.

Besides, there's a 64/65 hydra with trample in play already. Most likely the life gain was just that silly."
fatlogic,ff6nmqb,t1_ff5qau5,1579631044.0,"I think it's fair to say that it's normal to have an unhealthy relationship with food, therefore it is normal to overeat. However, the real question is why it is so common for people to overeat, and I feel like that's mostly obvious."
IdleHeroes,ff6juda,t1_ff6jey0,1579628738.0,I am actually wrecked on a merged server. Maybe beating night 15 is more possible but beating day 15 ten times per month is impossible. I have to use tokens in day just to beat 15 and it is not even guaranteed win. I run into stuff like E5 penny with E3 aida or Amen Ra. They just do too much for me to be able to get through without losing stuff.
IdleHeroes,ff6jb8r,t1_ff6itgi,1579628417.0,"Ya and I mean you can do a merge already. You just need to invite everyone manually. It's definitely a low-priority, nice-to-have kind of thing."
fatlogic,ff6gqa1,t1_ff5y59r,1579626836.0,"IIRC it got modified *once* in the past and that is the single point they are targeting with that.

I think the dumbest one on this list is ""dehumanizes fat people"". It's just a number. It's a fact. Like my grade in a course. Did my grade suck? Maybe. Does that mean I'm dehumanized? lol. It makes no sense.

Might be tied with ""developed by a statistician"". So what? I think maybe they think they are such a special snowflake that they couldn't fall into the stats. They *have* to be an outlier because they are that special."

IdleHeroes,ff67qps,t1_ff65bh7,1579621129.0,Don't really need to replace. Just build up Gustin to 10-star (or 9-star? I forget) and then regress ormus gives all the food you need. IIRC you only miss out on like 3 5-star fodders by regressing as opposed to replacing.
IdleHeroes,ff65n9y,t1_ff2wimz,1579619717.0,"I think the easiest implementation would be for the two guild leaders to agree which guild is the primary guild. Then, essentially, the other guild is deleted and all members transfer to the primary guild. All members transferred are no longer official or guild leader.

Just needs to make sure you can't merge if there's not enough room in the primary guild."
IdleHeroes,ff65ajp,t1_ff2uzv9,1579619474.0,"It's still better to be in a strong guild in the long run. You do not get to repeat the first bunch of bosses and the flame shrine rewards are not very favored to the top players compared to the rest of the bosses.

You will have a maxed mill much sooner which pays out a ton of guild coins over time.

You will place better in guild wars which pays out more guild coins (you can't even participate in it if you only have 2-3 members IIRC)."
IdleHeroes,ff62fqs,t1_ff5t56b,1579617435.0,"> When did Shelter give Aida again ??

Right now. **EDIT**: not sure why I mix this up. I think they meant altar and that is how I read it as well lmao

OP probably also spent 100 blessing to invite an Aida copy.

OP probably put POs into L/D to get more L/D fodder. It adds up.

I'm guessing they either got super lucky at xmas or they did actually skip the artifact to get Aida."
IdleHeroes,ff625gc,t1_ff45cut,1579617222.0,"It's not too bad for me because my main account is like 17 months old while me F2P alt is only 1 month old. There's such a disparity in the gameplay that I am having a lot of fun with it, and it's very nice for me to analyze each new event from F2P super early game account versus my old account.

I admit I get more hyped about the alt account progress because it happens much more often but my main account is like a ticking time bomb. I have 936 feathers and a ton of fodder. I can actually make 2 E5 heroes with what I have. I'm just not 100% sure which direction I am going yet. I also find IDA is a really good addition to the game since it gives players wanting to do more something to do / work towards."
IdleHeroes,ff61svf,t1_ff4h6k8,1579616960.0,"My Cthugha rush has been killing it by himself lol. It's been especially good with the the recent events and I got lucky so I had 9-star Cthugha in less than a month.

Just need a bit more forest fodder and I will have 10-star Cthugha. I think I will get to nightmare in Aspen with that."

EDIT: I'm a little skeptical on the events only because they are meant to be bigger and better ones with Christmas, New Year, and Chinese New Year. They certainly did well with all these event but I think it will be back to the usual grind after this event (which is expected). I guess though if I compare to the Easter event from last year they did a much better job with these events with choosing a P@W artifact to obtain."
IdleHeroes,feo73qy,t1_feo67ez,1579295977.0,Belrain over Asmodel is a good idea. I would go for Garuda next since E2 Amen Ra is probably sufficient and Garuda does ridiculous amounts of damage.
IdleHeroes,feo6njz,t1_fenofiy,1579295863.0,"This is true. I think it's important to check first though. You get like 35 HS or something like that and that could put the player to 200 HS comfortably. It could be the case that doing the HS side first is a better way to go so that you get the HS required for the second invite (worth 400 more fireworks).

That is how I will do it in my F2P account since I only had about 100 HS to start with. Combined with all the free ones we are getting in the event, daily quests and all that, I will get to 200.

If I went for POs first, I would not reach 200."

The Christmas P2W artifact was the heaviest RNG thing in the game to date and a lot of people got fucked over. Sure, there was no true loss for not getting it, but there is the effect that every lucky player is ahead of every unlucky player on a given server for no reason other than blind luck - at least on newer servers where players could not have saved up resources by then.

In my main account, I certainly liked Christmas more because the artifact was guaranteed with my built up resources. I did also get a lot more useful dummies. Note that they also cost fodder in the gingerbread thing though, but that is not a high cost."
MagicArena,fenhfuj,t1_fencpme,1579284761.0,"At that point, Gary is basically a burn spell and your board might be wiped by the time you get to play him, making it a weak burn spell. I guess he's a little better in an aggro mirror at least. I feel like Gary doesn't make a lot of sense unless in an aggro deck unless there's really no better top end or burn spell.

I'd rather just go rakdos aggro and run some actual burn spells for the reach."
IdleHeroes,fendsl8,t1_felxujy,1579282530.0,"How do they synergize? I feel like there is some tension since they both want slot 1, and Horus primary damage comes from % of HP damage which, IIRC, already completely ignores armor.
