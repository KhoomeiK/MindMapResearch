In this town I literally have one friend. One. (Not complaining; I say this because it's not a matter of me favoring other people over her.) But she is still the one who initiates contact most of the time. Because I'm an introvert and it honestly just doesn't usually occur to me to say ""oh hey I should be with another person right now."" We both have kids; mine are older so it's usually easier for us to get together at my house because then my kids can entertain themselves whereas her baby is happy just being held wherever. Which means that sometimes she is basically inviting herself over to my house.

I handle this by addressing the issue directly and  acknowledging that I'm putting the initiation work on her, apologizing for it, and making really sure that if I have to turn down an invitation due to schedule conflict I try to be the one to initiate the next one or set up a raincheck day right away.
