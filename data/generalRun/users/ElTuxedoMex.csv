I was looking for a motherboard on a new store in Mexico, proceeded to checkout to see fees and everything and found out the delivery would be arriving in 2 weeks. Since I was in kind of a hurry I left it like that and forgot about it for a couple of days. Lo and behold, by the second day I got an email with a 5% additional discount.

You're the funny person. You get people to laugh every single time you open your mouth, it's like magic, goddammit. Someone's blue? You tell a joke, everyone laughs, the person thanks you for cheering them up. A group of friends? You're the one invited everywhere because everyone has a great time laughing. And if you miss a beat, it's ok, most of the time it works and when it doesn't, everyone's ok.

And then always someone, somewhere, tells you: ""You should be a comedian!""

And then one day you say, ""You know what? I should!"" And then you go to Open Mic, and get good feedback, and you spend a year, two years working on your shit, and you learn there's a method to the madness, that it requires effort, practice, dedication (like all the good things in life, nothing comes easy). At first you think you gonna get it easier, you already made people laugh, right?

But then you discover the harsh truth: it's easier to make people laugh when they are not expecting you to make them laugh, when it isn't your duty to make them laugh. When you're ""a comedian"" suddenly people raise their expectations about you. And if you don't work hard, if you think you're a natural, that things should be easy for you and don't need to practice or go the distance, you're for a rude awakening.

Sure, we had Commander Keen as a platformer, but as  good as it was, it wasn't Super Mario Bros. And while the consoles got ports of computer games, it wasn't as good as playing it on an actual PC with the keyboard and the mouse or the complexity only a computer could have. 

So before ports and simultaneous releases were not only common but well done, the idea of playing NES games on a computer, not similar games but 100% the same game (or the closest emulation could deliver back then) really blew our young minds.
