It makes the first order more competent and therefore more threatening, it gives holdo a damn good reason not to trust Poe, and it gives Poe something to atone for.

>But [doctors] are clueless about the actual mechanisms of healing, the intricate and extremely complicated processes of the body, and how to support the body so it can heal ITSELF. So if you are looking to them to actually bring you back into health and vitality, you will never find it. Just more pharmaceuticals, surgeries, side-effects, and more poor health. Look at you, you actually believe that your discs can't heal and that you have to suffer with them getting worse and worse. Why wouldn't the body be able to heal discs? It's tissue just like anything else, given the chance, the body WILL heal it. The body always, always moves towards health if it has the resources to do so. Your job is to figure out what YOU can do to assist it in its healing endeavors. Pills and surgeries aren't it.

>One last thing...I'm sure you are familiar with the placebo effect, but are you aware there is an equally powerful nocebo effect?

Or when they tell you ""You can't repair discs"".

>Just some things to think about. I encourage you to take a good, honest look around at the abysmal state of our collective health and ask yourself ""Do they really know what they are doing??""

Fyi, the reason discs don't heal is because (in simple terms) they're made of cartilage and don't have a blood supply. Cartilage just doesn't heal itself very well. There are other areas of the body that we also know don't heal themselves: enamel of the teeth is a great example, as are most nerve cells."

>We work more than medieval peasants under the feudal system and we also work more than people originally worked under early capitalism and own less of our work by far.

You're correct, but most of this is voluntary, which was my point. A college degree isn't necessary to make a living. A car is less necessary than it seems, particularly because bikes exist. But also, Americans have an aversion to walking anywhere. And certainly there are cheaper cars that one can purchase. You can buy used or just get a small, basic car. Housing of some kind is required but there's no reason someone needs a house instead of a condo. 

But many people want these things and will work more to get them.

To piggyback on your boycott example, I've basically said that if you don't like the product, you havre the choice not to buy it, but you're complaining that other people still are. If you don't think the product is worth the cost, you can be happy without it. If you think industrialization does more harm to quality of life than good, then you're welcome to withdraw from that aspect of society. You can grow your own food, make your own clothing, etc. You can be an independent artisan if you want. I have you suggestions of you want to minimize industrialization in your life. Hell, if you're successful, you might get others on the same path. But you seem to think that it wouldn't actually benefit you, citing that it would be only you.

This seems rather black and white. The fact is that under capitalism you could make the choice to live a more feudal life, and I think it's good you have that choice. Feudalism offers less choice. If you can convince a group of people that it's better, go for it! You have my blessing, not that it matters.

Okay. Then do that. But you're quite wrong about the american healthcare system. 1. Anyone can go to the emergency room and they must treat you. 2. After the age of retirement, almost everyone has healthcare iirc. I'm not saying the american healthcare system is perfect, far from it, no one should go into crippling debt from a cancer diagnosis, but I think it's often misrepresented as well.

None of that crap, besides maybe the house of some kind, is necessary. But most people choose to take that on. Particularly, one can earn a degree for free if they join the military.
