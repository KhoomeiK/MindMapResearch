TooAfraidToAsk,fernsj9,t3_eqgjeu,1579356242.0,"I recently watched this short series called Dirty John. It freaked me out. I can see the similarities between me and the main bad guy and i dont want to be like that, or even stay how i am because its just a version of him. I dont want to be a real life bad guy. I dont want to be someone people avoid. I want to be liked,  and i want to genuinely care for other people. Great question!"
