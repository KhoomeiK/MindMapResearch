If that's as good as it'll get then nuke this cuntish planet already. 

Everyone is scared of a WW3 or climate change and I say bring it on. I'm sounding like an edgelord I know but that's how I feel.

Humanity has wronged me and people like me on so many levels I wish for some payback. I fucking hate people. They're either pure evil, or pure privileged idiots who don't really care for the blight of others.

I fucking hate politicians, I hate idiots who vote for them. I hate those who identify on the political spectrum like it's something to be proud of. It's a scam you fucking retards. You're being manipulated so they can profit off you. Oh well you all deserve it for being stupid cunts.

I hate religion, it's pathetic to believe in this Peter Pan shit tbh. 

Fuck people, nothing but boring, vain idiots talking about the most pointless shit I can possibly imagine. Faking smiles and cordial language only to go home and show their true colours on the internet behind a fake name (I'm one of them because their cuntiness rubbed off on me)..I don't understand their interests, what makes them laugh, wha motivates them to have children only to whine about how ""being parents is so hard!"" :( !!! As if the retards didn't think it through before conceiving. Did I mention how much I hate how people are completely ok with spending 70% of their lives working their asses off and think of it as normal? fucking idiots think it's ok to spend 50 years out of 70 of their lives at school or work. Not worth it.

I hate them for caring about having careers and stupid money so they can waste it on shit they don't really need or want. 

Let them set themselves on fire while I'm watching the spectacle until I'm caught in the shitstorm as well.

SuicideWatch,fe5pfz5,t3_enrwmg,1578872557.0,"I don't identify as a human anymore. I don't share their common interests, goals, motivations. I don't understand their humour or why they're happy. I have nothing in common with the average person keeping pretences and hosting christmas and birthday gatherings, nodding and having pointless small talk.

I don't give a fuck about politics or social issues, I don't understand why many are cruel to others, judging them without knowing them, why do they act violent and oppress others. I don't really understand vanity, what clothes to wear, what car to drive, what career choice to make..what to study..

I don't want to be here surrounded by slaves, everybody is a slave to something and it's pathetic. I'm tired of smiling, there is nothing to smile at in this tragic world. 

I feel so numb tonight. Usually I'm in pain but right now I'm so dull, less pain but more empty and suicidal and it's dark. I wish I wasn't born because human societies are pathetic and I wish for a complete collapse of their social and monetary system so they can just vanish. We weren't meant to be here."

There is no fee since Pozzo owns both clubs. It's just an internal transfer.

soccer,fe4hftl,t3_ensawz,1578859344.0,"Benfica must be very confident if it's an option to buy. Because if things don't work out he'll just be returned with a tarnished reputation. They won't really get another chance that's why it's a weird deal.

Benfica would have done the right thing if they've sold him for 25M euros plus 5 in add ones, with like 20% of future sales or something. This deal is bad for them imo."

soccer,fe47e62,t3_enrsu6,1578856456.0,"He won't last 4 years though. He's too toxic, too outdated, and he won't take shit from Levy being a stingy cunt, and Levy won't like that.

I have no idea why did Levy think it's a good idea to bring in Mourinho knowing what kind of manager he is. At least Poch was patient when it comes to lack of financial backing."
soccer,fe43jg1,t1_fe42lrj,1578855456.0,"He's not world class.

He has pace and that's it. Poaching few tap ins from amazing work from KDB, Bernardo and the rest don't make him world class. He'd struggle with a team with less service."

They have a decent squad, they need to consider this immediately because losing extra 30-40M on changing managers and like 2 new signings can make a big difference. Better than going down and having their income cut by over half in the championship."

soccer,fe39rag,t3_enpmrq,1578847274.0,"A bit too late. They should have spent in the summer instead of getting 3 loans that can't possibly get a start, and a damaged full back for few hundred thousands.

I know it's not all about spending (examples being Fulham last season) but anyone who watched Norwich knows they don't have enough quality to compete at a top level without a major overhaul to the squad."
soccer,fe38kge,t1_fe379ya,1578846959.0,Have you seen him play? One of the best defenders outside of the top 7 imo alongside Coady and O'Connell. He would be an upgrade over Christensen and Zouma easily.
soccer,fe37gsi,t1_fe36y17,1578846679.0,"I rate Dunk really highly, if he was 2 years younger it would have been a no brainer.

I'm not really convinced with Ake at all. Maybe it's Eddie Howe who makes him and the rest of their defence look like shit, but he's just not really up for the challenge. Not much of an upgrade over Zouma. It's better to go for better quality even if it's going to be expensive and for fewer years like in Dunk's case. Chelsea can afford that."
soccer,fe36dzs,t3_enpezr,1578846427.0,"I said you were dusted and buried only 5 weeks ago. But It's looking like you'll be able to pull through and deservedly so.

Other than Norwich, it's impossible to say who's gonna go down. Too many choices that are within a couple of pts from each other, Even Burnley and Brighton can be pulled back in it with a couple of bad results. 

Also it's all happening in the middle of the January window when teams are able to add more quality. Nothing is decided at all yet."
soccer,fe36022,t3_enpdgx,1578846269.0,"Not much of a gamble since there is no obligation to buy, and the fact that Atalanta are stocked at CB with Toloi, Palomino, Djismiti, Ibanez.

soccer,fe3514t,t1_fe30c57,1578845995.0,"Brooks is successful but he's been injured for the whole season so far, Ake is good, Billing and Lerma are half decent. Can't think of any really good signing in the PL era."
soccer,fe33tt2,t1_fe31kay,1578845631.0,"But oh look it's poor Bournemouth who live within their modest means!

Except of the fact they're owned and backrolled by some another Russian oligarch who's not shy when it comes to spending. Except of the fact they've spent a ton of money on signings in recent seasons without really selling any major players to finance that. In his 4 PL seasons, he spent around 220M on transfers despite selling players for around 50M total. They're not poor.

Howe's just poor for the PL. He has an abysmal defensive record, I don't think he's had a PL season where his side conceded less than 60 goals. He makes a classy defender like Ake look shit by the way he sets up his backline.

His highest finish is 9th. Not bad, but they make it look like he's now entitled for a top 6 job lol."
soccer,fe330rc,t1_fe31etr,1578845434.0,"Billing and Lerma are alright. Haven't seen Kelly and Danjuma play but if they can't cut it in this Bournemouth team then there is something wrong with them. Same goes for Rico.

Solanke and Ibe for 35M is a sackable offence for whoever gave the ok."
soccer,fe31tor,t1_fe31532,1578845130.0,I think it's just a Pozzo loan switch kind of deal. He's not needed for depth at Udinese right now so he can just transfer his assets to Watford who need some sort of attacking depth.
soccer,fe2zjgz,t3_enp21g,1578844487.0,"I'm not sure if Deuofeu and Sarr are really that brilliant or is it that Bournemouth's defence is just L2 level.

soccer,fe2m4vf,t1_fe2ljtj,1578840371.0,imo he won't be sacked anyway. He got them out of L1 all the way to the PL and have been stable for many seasons now except of this one. He's a former player and cult hero for the club. Even the fans won't turn on him. He'd be the man to be entrusted to get them back up imo

soccer,fdxq9o0,t1_fdxmoib,1578771738.0,"Gomez isn't anywhere as good to be a starter for Liverpool. He has pace and can fix mistakes with it but that's about it. His passing, positioning is awful and he makes more mistakes than Lovren."
soccer,fdxoz5e,t1_fdxmm6j,1578771354.0,He wants out and he's acting unprofessional about it instead of helping the club until the last game.
soccer,fdxorai,t1_fdxmpge,1578771291.0,True. Their best current midfielder.
soccer,fdxc2pz,t1_fdx9ij6,1578767288.0,"Their midfield is abysmal though. Eriksen is quality but he doesn't want to be here obviously. Winks and the full backs need binning asap. No good finisher in Kane. Moura runs like a headless chicken and Son playing centre is useless. I didn't even remember Alli playing today..he's been invisible.

No goals can possibly come from this sort of attack and formation against a good defence like Liverpool."
soccer,fdxb8yv,t1_fdx9vir,1578767118.0,"Man City last 2 seasons were amazing. And despite the great football, it got really boring. Their home fans barely cheered when they scored because of course they're going to."
soccer,fdxb235,t1_fdx9x37,1578767049.0,Liverpool are a great side. Not having their best game but them being CL winners is not surprising. Tottenham however..
