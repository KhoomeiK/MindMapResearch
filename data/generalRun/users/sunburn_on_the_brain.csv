movies,fgu9u1h,t1_fgtctqo,1581115715.0,"I think RJ is probably more aware of the pitfalls of sequels and the types of things that often go wrong in them.  I'd expect he's going to be careful about writing this.  One common problem with sequels is that they just try to do too much. (TROS is a prime example of that.) With Knives Out, he has a unique freedom. You've got Benoit Blanc returning, but other than that a new story, a new cast, new characters. In that regard it's barely a sequel. Mystery writers typically have their main detective and a few recurring supporting characters (the secretary, the detective's spouse, people like that) but completely new stories, sometimes with a minor callback to a previous book.  Doing another movie in this fashion is perfect for the mystery genre."

If you’re up for a bit of a walk, look up Shoshone Point to get away from a lot of people. Assuming you stay overnight and you have the time to make the drive without being rushed, you can leave the park after Desert View going east on 64, and that’s a really nice drive, passing viewpoints for the Little Colorado River gorge.

For example, if you were going to hike in the Rincons, you'd be going from 3000 feet to over 8000.  That said, you could do a loop in the Rincons like this: Park at Javelina Picnic Area. After a short road walk, pick up Cactus Forest Trail until you get to the other side of the road loop (a little over 2 miles.) Then stay on Cactus Forest until you get to Mesquite Trail, take that to Squeeze Pen, then Carrillo Trail. Stop and check out Little Wildhorse Tank and Garwood Dam along the way. Continue on Carrillo to Three Tank Trail, and take that to Douglas Spring Trail. (Most of these trails are pretty flat until you start climbing on Carrillo. There's a gazillion little trails there, but you're not likely gonna get lost.) Take Douglas Spring Trail, stop by Bridal Wreath Falls, and then make your way to Douglas Spring Campground for the night. This is about a 14 mile day. The next day, make your way via Douglas Spring and Cow Head Saddle trails to Manning Camp. This is only about a 6 mile day but you're gonna be climbing 4000 feet. Set up camp, and go explore some of the short trails in the area, maybe go atop Mica Mountain. Day 3, take Manning Camp Trail down and back up to Cow Head Saddle (or if you're tired, just take Cow Head Saddle Trail) and then take Tanque Verde Ridge trail to Juniper Basin campground (you can stop and get Tanque Verde peak along the way if you're so inclined.) This is about a ten mile day. Day 7, it's a little under 7 miles to your car via Tanque Verde Ridge trail, and you'll have some awesome views, plus you'll go from pine/juniper forest to oak/juniper grasslands to saguaro desert."

Remember what you really need.  You need a place to sleep and protection from the elements available (some people cowboy camp but you still need to be prepared in case of rain, be it with a tarp or tent or whatnot.) You need to be able to eat. You need appropriate clothing. You need to be able to care for yourself. You need water. And you need a way to carry it all. My tent weighs 2 lbs with stakes and polycro. My quilt weighs a pound and a half, less if I’m going out in warmer weather. My pad weighs a pound. My pack weighs 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 lbs depending on what pack I take. For clothing I carry an appropriate jacket, an appropriate base layer, and a pair or two of extra socks and underwear - there’s no need for a full change of clothes. I have my food, my stove, and my titanium pot. I have smart water bottles and maybe a water bladder.

Tucson,fg3z38m,t1_fg3sogf,1580492732.0,"Gotcha. One of my favorite routes out here is the Sabino-Bear Canyon loop.  You can hike it either direction, clockwise or counter. I prefer counter but it's good either way. To go counter clockwise, start at the Sabino Canyon Visitor Center, and take Phoneline Trail to its end (a smidge over 5 miles.) That puts you at Sabino Canyon trail. You might run into people hiking Phoneline after taking the tram up, but it shouldn't be a lot of people. Once you get on Sabino Canyon Trail and start north, you won't see many people. Go two miles, take West Fork Trail, and set up camp somewhere in the area of Hutch's Pool.  There's a sweeeeet camping spot about a mile from Hutch's.  For day two, you could explore towards Romero Pass on and out and back. Day three, you stay on West Fork trail unitl it's East Fork trail until you get to Bear Canyon trail. Take Bear Canyon trail back to Sabino and the visitor center.  This is about a 12 mile day but once you get to the Bear Canyon trail it's downhill from there with water alongside and some great views, and you can stop at Seven Falls. There's a lot of water out along most of this route once you get past Phoneline right now and it should be good for several weeks.

Some people are up for that.  Typical hikers would probably want 3 weeks or a little more to do that stretch.  It depends on your fitness and ability."

The first part of the movie starts out ok, with a lot of building up the story and getting us familiar with the characters, and the interesting step of showing us what really happened to Harlan. Then the will-reading scene... this was pretty much Rian Johnson detonating the bomb he had building up the whole time.  From the first mention of Marta's name by the attorney, the whole movie went absolutely nuts.  The closing shot is one of the best final shots I've seen in a movie.

arizonatrail,ffqv7bc,t3_euh7pm,1580144385.0,"Another thing you'll have to address is transportation to Tucson.  We are a gateway community, but we're also not super close to the trail unless you stop short of the Rincons in Vail, where you'd probably be able to get an Uber.  If you end the hike at the end of the Rincon Mountain passage, that's at Redington Road and that far out it usually isn't accessible by a passenger sedan, so you'd need someone with a vehicle with a little more ground clearance (my Subaru Outback did fine, but I wouldn't take anything with less clearance.) IIRC the Italian Spring trailhead out there is 12 miles past the end of the pavement, which is already getting out of the metro area. There also may not be cell service at that trailhead.  Another option would be to do the Redington passage and arrange a pickup at Gordon Hiraybashi campground, which is right off the Catalina Highway, so as long as they don't close that road for a snowstorm, anyone can get up there. That's 9 or so miles up the highway from the base.  What I would do is continue past Gordon Hiraybashi on the AZT until you reach the Sabino Canyon trail, and then take that trail into Sabino Canyon, and then you can either take Phoneline Trail (7.5 miles) or the tram road (6 miles with water available and restrooms along the way) to the visitor center, and get an Uber pickup from there.  That not only gets you much closer to transportation, but the hike down into that valley is a treat."

Ultralight,ffk5818,t3_eu00x8,1580016260.0,"Several years back, I noticed that I was spending a lot of my time at whatever event we were at taking photos, and I started to think that I was getting some good pics but that I was missing out on most of the event because I was too busy looking through an eyepiece trying to get a good shot. My camera choice nowadays reflects my desire to actually be present at whatever it is I’m doing. I still have my DSLR and I still work at getting better at shooting with it.  However, unless I’m going with the intention to get a certain shot, the DSLR usually stays home. I can snap some pics with my phone, and I’m rarely thinking when I’m out that wow, it would be a perfect time to have the good camera along right now. When I go out backpacking, I take a Canon point and shoot along. Small, long battery life, tons of storage, and I can pull it out of my hip belt pocket, turn it on, and be ready to shoot all with one hand and without breaking stride. I want to immerse myself in my trip rather than keep looking for what might be that really great shot, but I’m still able to get good stuff.  I’m sure there will be trips where I decide to take the DSLR along.

When you go to Zion GET THERE EARLY. Like a bit before sunrise early. It gets very crowded very fast. South rim has the better views, and lots of viewpoints. The visitor center and the Bright Angel Lodge areas get very crowded, but you can go see the viewpoints along Hermit Road (shuttle bus only in the warm months, but it’s free) and there will be a ton of viewpoints as you drive the east rim into the park. How flexible is your itinerary? If you’re able, you would save a lot of miles by going from Zion to Page and then take AZ 98 to US 160, and then to Monument Valley from there, and then you could go back down to Grand Canyon. Monument Valley is a long schlep out of the way and between driving out, seeing it, and coming back, it’ll take most of a day (unless you’re going east from there and then disregard me :) ) If you do go to Jacob Lake, make sure you stop at Navajo Bridge as you head toward the south rim. Also, you’ll be 20 or so minutes from Page when you reach the 89/89A junction, so if you wanted to see Horseshoe Bend (which now draws massive crowds) it’s not super far out of the way."

Tucson,ffcr7st,t3_esttzv,1579805584.0,"Our basic connection fee to TEP is $20 per month. The buyback at the end of the year (they ""settle up"" in October) is something like 2¢/kWh if I remember correctly.  I think we were around 300 kWh ahead last year and got like a $6 bill credit.  There's no real point to going much larger than what you use at that kind of buyback rate, so the installers will size the system to fit your usage.

You'll have ebbs and flows throughout the year.  We have a 4.2 kW system, and right now on a clear day we're producing about 18 kWh per day, because the sun is low in the sky.  We're actually a bit behind right now because of lower production in the cold season combined with keeping the house warmed up a bit.  (If you have an electric dryer, you will start to hate it when you see the power usage spike by 5kWh.) As the weather gets nicer we're going to start getting way ahead and banking credits for the summer months.  In May we've gotten as much as 33.5 kWh in daily production, and since the weather's nice, you're not having to run much heating or cooling. We started our system up in mid-March, and used 327 kWh while producing 460. In April last year we used 391 kWh, but we produced 830. In May we used 524 and made 918. In June, used 778 and produced 924. So just over 3-1/2 months we already had over 1100 kwh worth of credits, which was enough to get us through the summer without having to pay TEP any extra. Your production actually starts slowing down over the summer, because the heat makes the panels less efficient."
