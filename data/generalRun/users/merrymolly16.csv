college,ffa4zkd,t1_ffa3vub,1579727991.0,Don’t feel embarrassed. Don’t even tell them why you are leaving- just say personal issues. I told everyone I lost my scholarship which was 100% true because I was kicked out of school shortly after. Smh if they do say something then they aren’t your true friends.
college,ffa4sda,t1_ffa4gg2,1579727879.0,"Okay that’s valid. I do think you are correct there. Many do have a minimum of on campus credits you have to take.

college,ffa4jj0,t3_esi0qg,1579727740.0,"Perhaps instead of complaining, be grateful you have some breathing room. Perhaps take up a portable hobby you can do when waiting. You can also call a friend, people watch in the student union, watch YouTube, volunteer on campus, get involved in something during those hours? 

I personally use my break between classes for homework or sometimes the gym if I don’t make it in the AM. You can see if there’s an on-campus desk job you can take to fill that slot- make some money while you wait. 

I’ve had the same issue in the past but it doesn’t bother me much, just viewed it as time to catch up. Perhaps you can even nap in the library- I’ve done it loads of times :)

Best of luck!"
college,ffa3te8,t1_ffa3l9g,1579727331.0,Perhaps it’s better to take a break and work full time to save money. That’s what I did and it’s worked out decently. I’m going to be 26 when I graduate but I don’t care- there’s no rules about having to be certain age or whatever to get a degree. Chin up! Push through. You can do this :)
college,ffa3hd0,t1_ff9ykpf,1579727139.0,I transferred with over 100 credits- even took my Ds from my failure days. *shrug* perhaps I got lucky but I’ve never heard of a “maximum credit transfer” unless it’s in reference to AP credits.
college,ffa395i,t3_esgc5h,1579727007.0,"Yooo I failed out of a private out of state college my junior year and I had to move home. I got a minimum wage job and went to a community college to raise my 1.2 gpa. I managed to complete my 2 year degree in a year and a half and transferred to a public 4 year in state with a 3.4. 

It’s taken 7 damn years but I’m graduating in May 2020. 

It’s never “too late” to better your education and take care of yourself. Transfer to a local school if you can."

Twitch,ff97su0,t1_ff962w3,1579706837.0,"I mean i literally just told you how I promote my channel... 

Hashtags depend on what the content is. I am a female so I use #twitchgirl or #twitchkittens ... but it’s different for each post, for example I posted a picture of bourbon from Christmas and put #bourbon and got some follows from different distilleries or whatever. 

On twitter alone, I’ve gotten follows from much bigger channels by simply replying to a tweet they posted because they liked my attitude or my response and they want to see what I have to say. 

But I’d argue 75-80% of my growth comes from being an active member in other communities. I watch my streamer friends stream because I like to support them and I enjoy their content. Their community learns who I am and in turn from a shout-out and a quick plug, their viewers follow me and then when that streamer comes to my stream I do the same- promote their channel
And my viewers follow them. 

Those 10-20 answers though are how people grow their channel. (At least I can vouch that they work for me). There’s no magical recipe that is the “secrete” to streaming and growing. It’s all based on strategy and what that streamer wants to do with their stream. 

Also perhaps I am bias because I do not use Facebook anymore because I find the ads and all the crap on there a huge headache- I find it faster to use Twitter and Instagram to promote my channel because I know that’s where streamers post their content and viewers will see it. Discord is also great because you have your own little chat room with your community so you can give them instant updates (example: my internet went out, no stream today). 

As I said I believe you should try to see what sort of viewers you are trying to reach and promote accordingly."
college,ff96ktq,t1_ff9603y,1579706044.0,"I’d say pump the breaks a bit. 

Start dating as in going on dates and then actually ask her to be your gf. Jumping the gun can be reallllly messy when you try to untangle this stuff. I mean ffs it can be terribly distracting too to have an s.o. In class with you too. 
Perhaps it’s just a me thing but I like to make the other person work for the relationship status. If a guy just came up to me and asked me to be his gf I’d laugh and ask why not a date first. 
But this is neither here nor there.

I bailed on the idea of dating in college long ago. As a super senior, I started dating a guy who had already graduated and it’s worked out amazing! 

Just know you play a risky game on thin ice. Best of luck. Hope y’all can keep it together."

college,ff95qgr,t3_esappt,1579705477.0,"Best piece of advice: don’t date in your major. 

I have a t i n y major like classes are 5-25 people and I started seeing this guy who I had to do a final project with. It was fun until I told him I wasn’t interested in seriously dating him. So I had to sit next to a kid who hated me in 3 of my classes for the whole fall."
college,ff95bkm,t3_esbzv9,1579705198.0,"I got dumped over the summer 2 years ago, when I got back to school I was stunned by the amount of “free time” I suddenly had.

Twitch,ff94yup,t3_escpx7,1579704958.0,"Okay for one, I tried just playing fortnite on my pc and it kept crashing so I just gave that up all together because the game is too big now for my potato pc. 

I will say that I streamed on a MacBook Pro 2012 (started streaming in 2015) and I used it for 3 years. I reached 1k follows on useless dinosaur. So you can literally stream on anything! 

But I will say that if you are trying to game I’d look into maybe upgrading something if there are issues with the games you’d like to stream."
Twitch,ff92xaa,t3_es8haj,1579703537.0,"Personally I just take the advice I was given which was to use Twitter and Instagram the most because of the generations that frequent twitch. I methodically select hashtags that pertain to the content of the post as well as are not over saturated. I’ve had a lot of success with this vs when I didn’t engage on those platforms (when I say engage I mean comment on others posts, repost them, etc). 

I’ve also done a fair amount of networking through discord. If you are in a community and are eligible for a “streamer” role, you can gain traction that way too. Discord shows your status as “streaming” when you are live, it’s like effortless advertising. 

I know you said you don’t find this important but trust me, networking with other streamers is awesome. You can do co-streams or events together- this way your communities meet one another via stream and it’s a mutual exchange. I often get follows from just siting in chats of other streamers while I am offline and this is because I get to be genuine behind my keyboard too! 

Anyway, I’ve never used a marketing agency or Facebook because I feel like that’s not where my demographic lies for viewership- perhaps taking a step back and trying to decipher what demographic you are targeting and the best way to reel them in. 

Best of luck!"

Also play your hashtag game wisely. Use unsaturated hashtags that pertain to the image or content.

I have wanted to send them Christmas presents but some have turned down the offer. Ive made them handmade bracelets which is usually make for my 3,6,9,12 month subs. But I wouldn’t ever pay them simply because 
1. We are friends and that’s weird
2. I don’t expect my mods to show up every stream like it’s a job
3. It’s a volunteer basis- I’ve had mods step down simply because their life has changed and they don’t have time to commit to the channel

Also as a mod I never expect to be payed or given anything extra in the channels I mod. I find it gratifying to simply be a mod in chat and engage with the streamer and community. It’s an honor to be selected as a mod- the streamer places a great deal of trust in you, so I don’t expect a pay check. I try to sub when I have the funds and just support the channel the best I can by showing up and making chat a fun and inviting place."

I like to make them funny.

Twitch,fehyg6j,t3_ep9aep,1579126396.0,"Having someone to talk to is life changing as is learning that you are not alone.

I cannot afford therapy so it’s nice when I can just get something off my chest and use it help other people struggling with the same thing. 

I think it’s super great that there is a break down of stigma around mental health  and that people are more open.

I have someone in my community who has multiple personality disorder and she says that people ban her from other communities because they have no idea how to engage with her.
It’s really sad to see the internet- one of the most diverse and welcoming places shut doors on people when they need it the most. 

So I am super jazzed about twitch embracing this.

HOWEVER, 90% of my friends who do talk about mental health always include the disclaimer that they are not a professional which I think is equally as important."

This month was a weird one because everyone got paid early and I’m personally not expecting a payout in the month of January because I was already paid.

Twitch,fdrnq2u,t3_emu21o,1578687124.0,"I pride myself on my carefully crafted stream titles which almost always contain the following:

3. Typically correlates with the day of the week the stream is 

Now lots of people do like “mix it up Monday” or “sub game Sunday” but those aren’t what I’m taking about. 


My content is currently changing due to the new year but a few of my titles include Wine About it Wednesday and USA Thursday. I have others but basically each one of my streams titles correlates to what sort of music is played, what the content is, and how I dress. People really like it.

I go to a state school that has 10,000 students and there is another private university as well as a trade school that functions like a residential sort of school soooo I WISH they had rules that limits underclassmen from moving off campus. 
There is a housing shortage in the city and rent is jacked up in price but they place are dumps because landlords don’t have to fix anything because someone will rent it no matter what. 

Its really really really bad and as someone who is 25 and still going to school, being beat out by 19/20 year olds for housing feels really bad man.

Also a lot of viewers will follow up with things that happened last stream, and if you don’t know what went down, it’s hard to track and mesh the two together. 

Your mods also might not know what to do because it isn’t the same person so like what are the rules? Are they the same? Does the new temp have different rules? How do the mods know which to enforce? It’s confusing.

I know people follow me and come to stream because they like me- they could care less what I’m doing on my stream, they just like hanging out and vibing with me and the rest of chat. 

This just sounds messy. You are better off doing a co-stream or an IRL same place stream together."
Twitch,fdot15k,t3_emeqv9,1578612223.0,"Hmmm unless the streamer asks for it, there is really very few ways comments of this nature can be seen as “welcome”.

If I ask for someone to share with me what I can improve on that’s one thing, but coming in and giving unsolicited advice is completely different. I don’t go around telling other streamers how to run their streams or how they can improve so I expect other streamers to give me the same sort of respect. 

It’s also different if you know the person who is giving you the advice rather they be someone that networks with you, a regular in your chat, or a long time connection. But it’s a MAJOR turn off when new people try to inject their criticisms into yourself without warning. 

I have a discord chat tab for my community to make suggestions or share ideas. The last thing I want while I live is for someone to come in and tell me change something when I’m in the middle of stream."

I’d suggest building a relationship with the professors solely because then if you end up missing an assignment or you have sh!t hit the fan they might be more willing to give you a free pass because there’s a line of communication already established. 

But if your major is large and you don’t have access to your professors then definitely tutoring or even going to other professors office hours could work- I’ve done it for courses like math and English. 

Hope that helps!"

I’d say have a planner, put your course schedule in your calendar app and set reminders for things like exams or major projects. Meet with your professors- let them know what is going on. You’d be surprised how understanding faculty can be.

In WI so getting up before the sun is up and it’s like 15°F out and there’s snow or ice on the ground- I have discovered I have to want to go work out, I mean who doesnt want to hit the snooze button. 

The other thing is carving out the gym time as if it were to be a class. Like I set a reminder on my phone if I am not working out in the morning to tell me to go to the gym. Sometimes my workouts are an hour, sometimes they are just 30 mins- depends on my schedule and the day.

Wages very based on your skill and position. You can make 35k being a mountain guide or 45k-52k being a camp director. But the perks and nature of the work do not confine you do a desk but rather you are helping people have fun and changing peoples lives. 

I don’t know I feel like people dismiss majors like mine as “a waste of time” but outdoor recreation alone accounts for 2.2% of the US GDP.

I’d advise you to try to put your “social eggs” in more baskets. Spending all your time with one person can lead to issues like this where suddenly you find yourself completely alone. Where I go to school now, I have friends in my major, in rock climbing club , as well as swing dance and the support services offered to students.

At the age of 9 years old I was diagnosed with ADHD and medicated. 

When I was 16 and a sophomore in high school I was diagnosed with both dyslexia and dyscalculia (math dyslexia). I was also informed I have the processing speed one third of what the “normal” person had, so basically When someone is talking to me, I don’t get all the information they are expressing. I was immediately told by my academic advisor that I would never make it past junior college and that I should give up entirely.
I simply rejected this idea so I worked my butt off my junior year and was accepted to all 4 of the private, out-of-state, 4 year universities I applied to- and not only that, I got merit based scholarships from all 4 as well. Lemme tell you how savory it was to walk into the advisors office with my acceptance letters, she never talked to me again after that.

Seeing as I have been in school for so long it’s been hard to differentiate between my depression and anxiety I have about school work. 

My ADHD isnt really an issue if I’m medicated. At times I can be impulsive which can be bad when it comes to procrastination and things like that. 

Since my diagnosis was so late with my dyslexia and dyscalculia, I was unable to receive any treatment to reverse it. 
Definitely my dyslexia and dyscalculia are super hard to work with, I hate reading aloud- that is when my dyslexia really gets bad. I usually have to reread chapters and re-take my notes to absorb the information I need. I also struggle with basic math, often making me look stupid in front of others. (I literally can’t do simple addition, subtraction, multiplication or division in my head. Example: 26-7 or 12x9) 

My processing speed is a big issue, if someone gives me a list of things orally, say 7 things, I can only remember 2 of them. Lectures without visual aids are extremely difficult for me. I’ve used a LiveScribe pen before which has helped in the classroom. 

I keep a religious planner. I color code everything. I input my courses into an outlook calendar and set alerts to remind me to go to class. I’ve used tutoring when I could and I enrolled in TRIO which is an academic help service the universities in my state have to help students who need extra support get through college. 

I often forget that I have these differences because I’ve lived with them my whole life. When I got a D in my stats class, it didn’t shock me because it’s literally all word problems and math- which were extremely taxing on my mental state. 

I sometimes find myself thinking that I’m a failure, that my advisor in high school was right but after I’m proud to say that after 7 years of college I will be graduating with a BS in May 2020! I’m super excited to be done."

I usually hold my nose and do whatever sort of ridiculous task they require for points. 

At one point my professor humiliated me in front of 62 underclassmen and so I dropped his class. (I basically emailed him the night before the midterm paper was due to tell him I would Not be submitting mine on time and that I would accept the 20% late penalty- he then proceeds to stand up in front of my whole class the next day and ask “ARE YOU REALLY NOT GOING TO TURN IN A PAPER” yikes) 

Seems like they literally want you to procrastinate, first draft final draft baby! Let’s go! Take it as a learning opportunity. When you are writing, just put words on a page or pretend it’s a surprise in-class essay! 

Best of luck!"
Twitch,fdhmnl1,t3_elfvsp,1578425881.0,"I only use my starting stream and my be right back screen. I never use my ending screen because if I’m raiding someone, I want people to stick around instead of bouncing to another streamers stream. But that’s just me ^.^"
Twitch,fdhmhux,t3_elgakw,1578425785.0,"I’ve gotten roasted for saying this before but 

NETWORK NETWORK NETWORK! 

Go and hangout in other streams, join other communities and form relationships with other streamers. 

Have you tried setting up a co-stream with another streamer who streams the same game? 

Do you use social media as a tool to promote your content? 

I’ve dedicated much of my free time to coming up with stream titles and content/themes that will draw new people in from the browsing page. 
Like I have a “wine about it Wednesday” stream every Wednesday where I let chat complain about stuff or I’ll have a pre selected topic like what’s the worst meme format.

I’ve found what works for me. And it’s been a great journey, it’s taken me 4 years to get to where I understand what viewers will be interested in clicking on and staying to watch. And that is only because I myself am a viewer on twitch, I constantly scan browser pagers at least once every 2 weeks to find a new streamer I want to watch or network with- I make notes of why I like their stream and what made me want to click on their stream. 

Best of luck, don’t be discouraged!"

Honestly if you are too nervous to fill out the info I’d suggest waiting until you move out of your parents place to onboard."
