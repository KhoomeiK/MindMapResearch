Roses,fewofvd,t3_eqsz7u,1579417018.0,"Alright, so you’ve just pulled this photo from Pinterest (https://www.pinterest.com.au/pin/383580093262691066/). Can you show a photo of the actual rose bush with the roses on it? Because I think you’re talking shit. 

The only way you can buy them is via knock off seeds, or as cut roses. The cut roses are done using a dye, it is not naturally occurring. The seeds are the equivalent of snake oil."
bipolar,fevepl3,t3_eqlua0,1579396496.0,"I only got in to her music about 3 months ago, found so many songs that I could relate to, then found out she has bipolar. It made a lot of sense after that. Absolutely love her music!

Side note, this is probably one of my favorite videos ever. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=RDQOojyWHtZaE. She had a miscarriage just before this performance, but still didn’t want to let her fans down. The strength of that is unmeasurable!"
Roses,fer3hyk,t3_eqbhh7,1579349357.0,"Everything on it actually looks very healthy. How much sun does it get? I would recommend moving it somewhere where it gets basically full sun. Though, before you do that go and get some cow manure and Lucerne mulch from bunnings. Make the soil really wet, dig in about 2-3cm of manure, water in again, then add about 3cm of mulch on top. Make sure to leave a ring around the base of the rose where the mulch doesn’t touch the stem.  Keep that in a shady spot for a couple of the days so the manure doesn’t burn the roots, then move to full sun. 

For the fertilizer I have found black marvel pellet and liquid fertilizer to give the best results (both at bunnings also). No need to fertilize it that often, just follow instructions on the packet, use them together and you’ll be fine. I’m based in Sydney, so semi similar climate."

Please don’t put paper in the microwave...."
technicallythetruth,feqzwrf,t1_feq3q22,1579347930.0,"This is the worst post for this sub. 

However, put a paper towel under your food when you’re heating it (burgers, pizza, etc.) up, it will revolutionize microwaving."
Roses,feod0kq,t3_eq2lkg,1579298425.0,Have a look at St. Patrick or Midas Touch.
bipolar,fejc3w1,t1_fei3b4x,1579166559.0,"Lol yeah it fucked me up pretty bad. In the last month and a half I’ve been to the hospital 9 times and been at the doctor or getting scans done every other day. It’s been an absolute shit show. 

But, on a positive note, I’m feeling alright mentally. I’ve been through a lot worse in the past, I’ll probably go through worse in the future, so there’s no need to worry about it :)"
bipolar,fejb4wc,t1_fei8h78,1579165103.0,"The squarish one in the top left. It still tastes awful like this. One trick I have learnt is to put all my tablets under my tongue, then have the water and swallow. Usually there isn’t much saliva there so they don’t start dissolving and the taste isn’t as bad! Give it a go :)"

bipolar,feiwgrm,t1_fei03kx,1579149095.0,Haha it gives that tiny bright side to the mundane life of tablet taking.
bipolar,feiwe0i,t1_fei62qk,1579149033.0,"It’s working amazing! This is the best I have felt in as long as I can remember. I’m still far from great, but I can laugh again, I’ve got more energy and generally less depression and anxiety. I’be only just started taking the Lyrica and Pseudoephedrine for pain relief, so I’m really hoping it doesn’t fuck with my balance! Going to see my psych next week for a check up, it’s day two today and I’m super light headed, confused and forgetful. Hopefully once my body gets used to them it will settle down lol. 

I started taking the quetiapine and lamotrigine when I was first diagnosed around 6 years ago. I was a fucking mess back then and they settled me down a lot, but depression and anxiety was massive for most of it. Last year I started sertraline because the depression got too bad, that had a boost at the start then didn’t work. I started pristiq (which I actually left off the list for some reason) mid last year and it has been amazing! Really given the biggest boost! I’ve got the dosages I’m on below for a reference point. 


Pristiq (150mg in the morning), Quetiapine (300mg at night), Lamotrigine (200mg at night), Propranolol (40mg at night), Lyrica (100mg in the morning and at night - this is only my second day on them though)."
bipolar,fei2qbu,t1_fei0q6k,1579128986.0,"At the beginning of December i got pneumonia, bronchitis and influenza a at the same time. That lasted until the end of December, but now i have a few tears in my lung from all the coughing and a thing called pleurisy. They help with the pain and give more energy. I'm taking a nice cocktail of painkillers at the moment as well lol."
