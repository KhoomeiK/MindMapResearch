todayilearned,ffs8rm9,t1_ffryp6w,1580175923.0,I feel you dawg.  I obviously wasn’t sure about the exact years or incidents. Im just saying that whenever i got on a military aircraft i had legitimate anxiety about it.  I do with any aircraft but I suppose that’s somewhat of a normalcy.
todayilearned,ffqiu7b,t1_ffqfies,1580135800.0,"I don’t doubt that one bit. However being the grunts that just get shuffled on and off theres not much communication about the safety. Also, a few years ago I believe like 20 marines died in just Osprey crashes."

TooAfraidToAsk,feyr3yz,t3_equwha,1579449578.0,"More recent combat engagements have been mostly against insurgents who don’t have a uniform per se. 
when two conventional military powers engage in combat, say during WWII, typically uniforms are easy to differentiate especially to trained troops. Fratricide, unfortunately will probably always be prevalent. Maybe not as severe as say 100 years ago, but a possibility nonetheless. Also, engagements are rarely as close as they look in media. The typical firefight between combatants is at least a couple of hundred meters apart, if not way further, making it rather hard to not see where your buddies are and where the enemies are."

unpopularopinion,fepnob6,t3_eq2knz,1579325397.0,"Just a few days ago there was a homeless man walking from car to car in front of my job. Presumably asking them for money, with no luck. As i was walking in he made a b line for me. I was expecting him to ask for money, but he quickly said something like “hey brother, the headshop next door wont let me buy cigarettes because I have an invalid ID.”
He had the money for the cigs. I gladly walked in and bought him a pack and returned his money and told him to stay safe. Everyone has their vice, why shouldn’t they?"
progun,fep0gip,t3_eq4jhp,1579309378.0,"I feel like a lot of police officers have the “on patrol in a unconventional hostile country” mentality that makes them consider the public to  be their enemies by default. i can understand the potential stressors that police must have on a day to day, but that “us vs them” mindset is what’s endangering the common folk. These are the streets and neighborhoods of the US, not Fallujah."
