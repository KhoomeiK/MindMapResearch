it's a weird concept, life, it is defined as 'the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death.' but for some reason, that's isn't good enough for people. if you are religious you think a divine being(s) controls everything. if you arent, it's the big bang that started everything. I have a problem with the big bang and evolution and that shit, where did everything come from? surely it didn't just appear, science says matter cant be created or destroyed, so what the fuck? the problem with religion is that it seems illogical to think that a divine power(s) created something as insignificant as humans. we'll pick on Christianity now because its the only one I know. Genisis 1 ' n the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. **2** Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.' but that sounds as illogical as the big bang. now well get into humans. science says that man evolved from apes but what I don't get is how there aren't any of the neanderthals living anymore, it is dumb. the bible says that Adam was created from the dust and that seems ok because we are made from things in the earth but Eve was formed from the rib of Adam and that doesn't make sense but we won't get into that. now for why, why, we evolved from apes are we here, there is no real advantage to being able to talk. if we came from God or some other divine thing(s), what is the need for it all? if they knew this much suffering would occur, what's the point? this is something I've held onto for a while, thanks for reading(it's a weird concept, life, it is defined as 'the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death.' but for some reason, that's isn't good enough for people. if you are religious you think a divine being(s) controls everything. if you aren't, it's the big bang that started everything.
