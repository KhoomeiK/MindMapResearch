It is a miracle mineral tho. There's a reason why our impulse is to continue to use it."
todayilearned,fcntuaj,t1_fcnrdfh,1577818295.0,I litigated these cases in TN. Yes you got sued. In general it was ultimately the case that any company that had anything to do with asbestos had exposure simply because employee safety was not consistently the primary concern. And it wasn't always some evil corporate boardroom decision. Frequently a company would have good policies and procedures and provide proper equipment and front line supervisors allowed for lax application due to a desire to rush the job.
todayilearned,fcnr390,t1_fcnqaww,1577816842.0,"One of the good ones. As you can imagine, in that timeframe the equipment and protocol varied wildly."
todayilearned,fcndrbf,t1_fcnd8c1,1577809572.0,"Or in the early 80s when ""abatement"" began, which largely involved tear out of the old asbestos (far and away the highest exposure method) by guys in paper respirators with no supervision. Oh and the work was ""insulated"" from the overall building by simple tarps."
todayilearned,fcncqf0,t1_fcnc7z5,1577808897.0,"These stories are common. ""Take home"" cases are the saddest of them all, as they frequently involve small details like that. The primary exposure was the wife washing her husbands coveralls every day. When you would talk to these people, they would describe rooms layered in dust."
todayilearned,fcn95jl,t1_fcn1r9c,1577806465.0,"One of the truly terrible and underreported corporate conspiracies in our history is the cover-up of the dangers of asbestos exposure in the States last century. It's really really bleak. The manufacturers claimed they didn't precisely know of the dangers well into the 70s and employers continued to expose workers continually. There are documents demonstrating manufacturer's knowledge dated back to the 30s and employers/installers were so dependent upon the product that they ignored evidence and failed to protect workers until the 80s. 

The product was so intertwined with the lives of workers (it was used every day in heavy, hot manufacturing jobs) that I have heard stories of poor folk taking home asbestos cloth for diapers. 

It was a disaster."
