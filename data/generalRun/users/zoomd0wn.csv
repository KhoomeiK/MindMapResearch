kelpie,ff52nzi,t1_ff4iowt,1579578573.0,"Haha yes! They said he’s a kelpie mix! Me and my dog park homies have narrowed it down to kelpie and basenji! He definitely has the energy levels. Lol he’s 1 year and 3 months and he’s a whopping 27 lbs! He’s the perfect size for my life style, really sturdy dog who loves adventures and being active. Small enough for my house yet only plays with big dogs."
dogpictures,ff26bgc,t1_ff241aw,1579495038.0,His name is full name is Tripper. He’s named after me being an avid day/road tripper to go on adventures. He’s my partner in crime and accompanies me on every trip I go on(more like everywhere I go.) Hence... he’s my day tripper! Lol

cats,fe54pbv,t1_fe443hf,1578865629.0,Yeah that’s what we’re thinking.
cats,fe40ua2,t1_fe3s3y0,1578854664.0,Yeah! I agree. Sometimes my little sisters give them really bad names but they got this one right! Lol
cats,fe40jbl,t1_fe3xwzq,1578854627.0,Not that we know of. He is super shy and kinda roams the house and does his own thing.
cats,fe3qd4h,t1_fe2uu5t,1578851856.0,I agree! 20 is a milestone many cats don’t get close to!

vandwellers,fdf7udg,t1_fdf4s8b,1578355324.0,"Haha yeah we got a lot of clean body’s and minimal to low rust vehicles. The only downside is some things might be more expensive in California vs somewhere else. I like looking in Reno/Oregon area as well. Usually find good deals on things up there. 

I hear ya! I don’t have a van currently but I’ve grown up around cars my whole life. Currently have a lifted Jeep that is my adventure rig. Would love to build a vanagon one day. But not sure If I’m willing to let go of the Jeep! Lol"
vandwellers,fdenq77,t1_fde9rrt,1578342872.0,Depends on what you’re looking for. I like car guru. Look in California. A lot of clean bodies around here.

vandwellers,fd6bt7x,t3_ek3tl1,1578188574.0,"I have a grizzly cooler. 55qt in bright orange I believe to be exact. That thing is awesome. I have no issues with major ice loss on 4-5 day camping trips. Really good quality, American made and slightly less expensive than a yeti with the same if not better ice retention. 

9/10 from me.

Edit: I also don’t own a van, but I have a Jeep jk & usually my cooler is outside/in a bear box. So these are results based on getting sun & not temp regulated environment."
CampingGear,fd69tzb,t1_fcyr4jf,1578187722.0,Just wait til you hear about housing in the Bay Area. Lmao
CampingGear,fd673sf,t1_fd66t83,1578186484.0,"Hah! In my area that’d be more of a tech bro! Which isn’t me either. I was intending for it to be more of a camping vest. Throw it on in the AM go fish, beat it to shit not care etc. got a carhartt one instead for $55 and it fits my needs/me as a person better."
CampingGear,fd5qwng,t3_ek296m,1578180477.0,Lmao I  regret not buying a Patagonia vest that was 200 dollars normal for 30 bc it had a small rip in it.... I coulda..... patched it...... but eh ya live and ya learn.

cats,fcumlyz,t1_fcum5xe,1577984252.0,Hahaha mine haven’t done that yet! It’s turned into a tv show for this guy. I’ve discovered he loves to watch the news. The other one doesn’t really care about it and enjoys sleeping. I also caught my dog and both cats cuddling on the couch. (My dog is a rescue and newer addition to the family and has separation anxiety.) It’s almost like they are helping him relax and comforting him.
vandwellers,fcujni1,t3_ei3bjo,1577982519.0,"I’d be cautious about it. Personally I try and keep my camp as clean & unattractive to bears as possible. I’ve heard stories of black bears destroying cars to get some small scraps of food. But I’ve also seen campsites that would be a bears dream and they never even came around. I think it depends on how accustomed bears in the area are to humans & if they fear you. Make sure you stay strapped with some bear spray just in case. :) 

TLDR: I wouldn’t risk it personally."
overlanding,fcuhi8u,t3_eiyl88,1577981085.0,What is that thing?! It’s so badass.
kelpie,fclkru2,t3_ehthto,1577750089.0,My little guy has the same giant ears and is a kelpie mix. But he’s like a tri color almost like a German Shepard... yet only 27lbs roughly full grown. He definitely has the energy & athleticism though.
Advice,fc40wdc,t3_eg2oha,1577403710.0,"I’m straight, so I’ve never dealt with this situation from your perspective. However, I have friends who have came out to me & my response is always “you don’t need to tell me...” I don’t care about my friends sexuality, they are my friends regardless of who they are attracted to. I want them to live their life how they want to. It’s not a big deal that someone likes the same sex or the opposite sex, it’s completely normal and shouldn’t be treated as something so big and eventful. Be true to yourself and be confident in who you are. I can’t imagine how difficult your situation is and I can only sympathize for you and hope they don’t react poorly to you being who you are. I guess this was more of a pep talk than advice, however I hope that everything goes well and your parents can get over their ignorance of the situation and not look at you differently. 

Good luck!"
dogs,fc3y3ti,t3_efy3nf,1577401614.0,Thanks! I got a furbo for Christmas which is essentially that and it also can dispense treats. Was too tired to set it up last night so I’m planning on doing it when I get home! Hope it helps.
dogs,fc3uzqk,t1_fc3omig,1577399318.0,"Yeah I know it hasn’t been too long & he’s honestly adapted so well. I just want to make my boy as comfortable as possible. I know it’s rough for him he was a surrender to a shelter & then arf had him for a week until he came to live with me. He’s been doing so well & it’s not everyday all day so it could definitely be worse. Luckily my nextdoor neighbor(condo’s) loves him and is super understanding and the upstairs neighbor does even hear him and it doesn’t bother him if he did. He’s such a good and loyal dog and just wants love and to run around with other Shepard like dogs. lol 

I play nature sounds on loop while I’m gone and throw a bunch of treats and toys for him as well as some worn clothes for my scent. I think the longer weekends/days off in the middle of the week throw him off as that’s usually when it happens most. Thank you for your feedback! Just gotta stay patient."
