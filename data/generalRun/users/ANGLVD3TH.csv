pcgaming,ffeyqs0,t1_ffe59v0,1579870663.0,"The TL:DW seems to be they put a skeleton crew on a project Square Enix already weren't confident in, and so they couldn't fix it and monetize it quickly enough to ever turn a profit."
leagueoflegends,ffexb3p,t1_ffelq1q,1579869252.0,"I mean, if they give 1 frame of vision on Nunu when he spawns, there isn't much way that can be construed as a real disadvantage. The point is to check a box in the code, not actually let players see him."
leagueoflegends,ffex891,t1_ffellj5,1579869169.0,"Would it be so bad too ship the bandaid while still actively hunting for the root cause though? If it's such an illusive issue, seems like it's worth having a jerry rigged temporary fix while they collect data."

TVDetails,ffe3ixd,t1_ffdwwhs,1579835753.0,"I was really excited that they seemed to be getting darker in S3, but that went away pretty quick."
Grimdank,ffe1p32,t1_ffdmqwl,1579834399.0,Looks like a standard PEBCAK.
explainlikeimfive,ffe1hgz,t1_ffd99wb,1579834250.0,"Class 4 fires can ""burn"" water. They are so hot the H and O2 split, and the H burns."
DnD,ffe0tvk,t1_ffctk1x,1579833776.0,"The only hint in this one is the ambiguity of ""everything he used to learn."" Literally, it sounds like he perhaps lost his sight, sanity, or somesuch, but it might be an awkward ""everything he had been learning"" or ""everything he had learned."""
movies,ffe09l9,t1_ffdzd92,1579833367.0,"I agree that the editing was poor there, but those themes are definitely there in the movie. Joe is literally on a quest for pussy in the movie, and Nux definitely has daddy issues, though the movie doesn't really lean in to that hyperbole."
MovieDetails,ffcvczs,t1_ffcv4nf,1579808036.0,Weren't the Istari more like avatars than the being actually taking physical form?
SandersForPresident,ffcm6z4,t1_ffclua5,1579802412.0,State legislature is the 3rd largest English speaking legislative body in the world IIRC.

ftlgame,ffcenkd,t1_ffbxtmx,1579797827.0,"IIRC, they've said they don't think it works on smaller touch screens. Pretty sure the IOS one is iPad only, not phone."
videos,ffcdaua,t1_ffcbn6z,1579796984.0,He actually turned himself in the day after the story went public...
TalesFromRetail,ffc3l8m,t1_ffb60ap,1579790691.0,Honestly sounds like they may have had some kind of disability to me.
MagicArena,ffbx60q,t1_ffbm9kg,1579785661.0,Looks like he just bought his first cards a week or so ago. Probably isn't going to be going infinite anytime soon.
tifu,ffbqb3w,t1_ffbdlfn,1579778364.0,"Probably agitated your stomach enough to hit the emergency dump switch, but not enough to blast it into reverse."
