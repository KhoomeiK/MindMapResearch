todayilearned,ffisvak,t1_ffin242,1579981871.0,"I wouldn't point to a specific policy as it's very much a result of many factors, but perhaps the idea that a society will be at its best without government involvement, which leads people to think that freedom is preferable to strict standards in all situations. I'm not really a fan of big government, I honestly think they suck terribly at regulating business, but there are certain lines that can't be crossed if the society is going to remain functional. The management of inequality is one of these lines. 

The people have to believe that the meritocracy works, and the state has to do it's best to make sure it does. In the US, you have people touting the value of merit but no real action to improve it, which is one of the reasons for the polarization of  American politics. You have a group that has noticed the decline in social mobility, in reality and by the numbers, who are mostly young, college-educated, people, and another group, mostly older, who where raised in a time where social mobility was at an all-time high and are firm believers in it's strength. I have hope that the millenial generation will make the necessary changes to prevent a death spiral in the US once the boomer generation loses its numbers, so there's still a good chance everything will be fine in 20 years. 

As for habits being the determiner of social mobility, I would agree with you, but suggest that ""habits"" aren't something that we really have control over, so it makes it largely redundant. If you do some research on the philosophy behind the idea of free will, you'll find much disagreement about its existence, and I find the argument against to be more convincing. You could argue that the reason for the decrease in social mobility figures is because people have adopted worse habits, but a more important discussion imo isn't why individuals make bad decision, but why we would expect the average person to continue making the decisions we want them to make after radically changing their environment to the point where there is a lower chance of their success even after making all the ""right"" choices. 

The more the deck is stacked against them, the lower the number of people that voluntarily make the ""right"" choice, which put us in a realistic vs idealistic place. Do we continue telling people to pull themselves up by their bootstraps while knowing it'll reach progressively less people because our ideology wants us to, or do we actively make changes that have been shown to increase social mobility so that people are more inclined to climb the ladder? South Africa is an example of what happens the the wealth is soo heavily clustered that the state completely ignored the average citizen and only caters to the rich influencers."
todayilearned,ffin9ry,t1_ffilcb7,1579977957.0,"Many countries have their own unique responses to the decrease in social mobility, Brexit is yours. There is still hope, I'm not suggesting there isn't a way out, but there are clear trends occurring in the US and UK that suggest that they headed towards a death spiral similar to South Africa. If you look at levels of social mobility, the UK and the US have followed almost exactly the same trajectory after the 2008 crash, and they largely share the same thoughts on economic policy. There is a difference between getting fucked over while you have a stable job, in a stable economy, and living in a society where you're standard of living is decline by the year and the chances you'll remain employed long term are also decreasing. One leads to activism, the other leads to kidnapping the children of rich people."
todayilearned,ffidb6m,t1_fficctx,1579971149.0,"Why? Because we have more money than they do? What would happen to the US if the entirety of the one percent left the country and took their money with them today? The state would default on its debt or would suffer hyperinflation, largely destroying what has been built up to this point. Inequality creates the incentives necessary for this to happen to anyone, regardless of how big you build your castle. In fact, the bigger the building, the larger the damage it does going down."

todayilearned,fficq3q,t1_ffi9orl,1579970754.0,"This is an incredibly complicated question that would require an understanding of the literature to fully grasp the nuance of, but if I were to simplify some of the major points, I would say that capitalist systems with similar policies as the US and UK eventually lead to such a large disparity in income and wealth that the ladder gets too large for the average person to climb to the top, creating ""stickness"" at the ends of the distribution. 

Once this happens, the largest predictor of success or poverty becomes whether or not you were born that way in the first place, destroying the concept of the meritocracy. Since the same groups of people make up the same social class over time, you begin to see a decrease in the amount of people that make the attempt in the first place, with lower levels of people opting to take on debt to receive an education, among other consequences (you're starting to hear this rhetoric now in the US). As a result, over time, the poor get poorer, and eventually, the rich start to have trouble finding employable people, or people who can afford their products, so they lose profit. 

While this is happening, the crime rate is spiking, the rich start needing security to accompany their children to school, and they grow resentful of the lower class, and class conflict gets really bad. These factors lead to large amount of capital flight, as the rich decide their now struggling business would do better somewhere else, and they are scared for their families. 

All these factors further compound the growing inequality as foreign investment decreases, domestic capital and jobs leave, the lower class is quickly, and painful, losing their ability to feed themselves, and the state's tax revenue takes a plunge, likely making them unable to pay their debts (or resulting in massive inflation for countries that can print money). The death spiral is real."

To Fox news, this just looks like Canada failing to compete due to its socialized system, but in reality, it's because Canada intentionally offers shorter patents so that prices are driven down sooner.

Coping mechanism are good things because the alternative is not coping, which can be deadly.

I'm very happy to hear that you acknowledge that addicts and those with other mental health problems (which make up the majority of homeless people) can find their way out. You are correct about how necessary a support system is for getting out of such a destructive spiral, and you are correct that the people on the streets have a very small chance of getting out without it, but I suppose you underestimate how effective a relationship with a nurse or a therapist can be when you see them on what is usually a daily basis for many addicts.
 
Other than preventing the spread of disease (which was their original intention iirc), this was one of those findings that we didn't expect to see when the efficacy of safe injection cites was first being studied in their pilot regions. The fact that the necessary support system needed to eliminate substance abuse problems could be manufactured soo easily was a revolutionary discovery, and the fact that it had the potential to save soo many tax dollars that would otherwise have been spent on jailing and providing healthcare for inmates makes this a moral and fiscal no-brainer imo."

My preference for using strategies like safe injection cites isn't because I want to subsidize their lifestyle, it's because countries like Portugal have seen tremendous decreases in rates of substance abuse since their creation, which means it's a more efficient use of tax payer dollars than jailing them. I'm not sure how you can't see the hypocrisy of wanting to jail them at a much greater cost, which we know doesn't clean them up, versus choosing the option that will cost less and help more.

If the low costs do stick, which is generally what has been happening with Amazon, then I would argue that the consumer is the winner in this new arrangement and that this is just a company losing out to the competition. The act of putting a competitor out of business leaves unemployed workers that have the skills to start up shop quickly if they ever did try to take advantage of a monopoly position. It sucks for the people that it's happening to, but it's simply the market working as intended.

You should be sceptical of when a company's competitors using anti-trust charged language because it's often the case that they are just mad that they can't compete and would prefer that the consumers pay a higher price that they can afford to sell at. They want to use the threat of government intervention to break up companies that offer products/services at a price that they feel is too good to be true to the benefit of only a select few companies that were losing out."

This should cost around $120 but $70 of that will last him forever (razor and brush) and the rest will last a long time. In terms of quality, he'll have to spend twice as much on a new razor to get things that are marginally better, and many people don't see the need to upgrade past this razor, brush, aftershave combo.

wicked_edge,fepafjd,t3_eq49pk,1579315762.0,"This is a bit of a problem that often occurs with mirror finishes, sometimes things can look off when they are hit with light at a certain angle. I would inspect every baseplate individually to see if there are imperfections and try to look at the alignment at different angles of light. There's also the possibility that the blade itself is poorly constructed on some sides, which can also look different at the edge depending on how the light hits it. Lastly, there is, of course, the fact that the top cap posts are usually going to have some play with the center cut out of the blade so that it shifts one corner farther out than the other. 

That's something that you will even find in CNC milled razors because they are made to fit all blade types and some blade brands have different tolerances. You can remedy this by holding the blade tabs when you are screwing the handle on and just confirming that it's centred before fully tightening it. You can shift the blade to the center by pushing on the tabs slightly at the moment before it's fully screwed in.

One thinks it's a failure that must be corrected through deregulation, the other understands that this looks more like a feature of free markets that is created and encouraged by it, doing their best to find ways to push people into making the most optimal choices regardless.

I would argue that the sociologist has a more realistic view of how humans will influence policy, so while the economist may present the best option for the most people in the marketplace, they get to watch as politicians implement price gouging laws because they failed to take ""feelings"" into account. Ideally, we would elect people with knowledge of economics, philosophy, sociology, etc so that they have the tools to accomplish both, but, ironically, we don't live in that world because the free market has determined that the skills gained from those fields are of lesser value than others.

In this sense, it could be a good idea to disincentivize flipping on the Bazaar, as it could decrease the likelihood of someone buying up stocks of shaving goods that would otherwise go to people at decent prices. There's also the chance that some manufacturers may keep a small supply of their limited batch of goods on the off chance that they would gain in value in a few years, selling them off at a higher margin shortly before deciding to reproduce the product.

I'm very happy to hear that you acknowledge that addicts and those with other mental health problems (which make up the majority of homeless people) can find their way out. You are correct about how necessary a support system is for getting out of such a destructive spiral, and you are correct that the people on the streets have a very small chance of getting out without it, but I suppose you underestimate how effective a relationship with a nurse or a therapist can be when you see them on what is usually a daily basis for many addicts.
 
Other than preventing the spread of disease (which was their original intention iirc), this was one of those findings that we didn't expect to see when the efficacy of safe injection cites was first being studied in their pilot regions. The fact that the necessary support system needed to eliminate substance abuse problems could be manufactured soo easily was a revolutionary discovery, and the fact that it had the potential to save soo many tax dollars that would otherwise have been spent on jailing and providing healthcare for inmates makes this a moral and fiscal no-brainer imo."

My preference for using strategies like safe injection cites isn't because I want to subsidize their lifestyle, it's because countries like Portugal have seen tremendous decreases in rates of substance abuse since their creation, which means it's a more efficient use of tax payer dollars than jailing them. I'm not sure how you can't see the hypocrisy of wanting to jail them at a much greater cost, which we know doesn't clean them up, versus choosing the option that will cost less and help more.

The act of putting a competitor out of business leaves unemployed workers that have the skills to start up shop quickly if they ever did try to take advantage of a monopoly position. It sucks for the people that it's happening to, but it's simply the market working as intended.

You should be sceptical of when a company's competitors using anti-trust charged language because it's often the case that they are just mad that they can't compete and would prefer that the consumers pay a higher price that they can afford to sell at. They want to use the threat of government intervention to break up companies that offer products/services at a price that they feel is too good to be true to the benefit of only a select few companies that were losing out."
wicked_edge,feqpvbv,t3_eq0v3t,1579344639.0,"There be some bad recommendations on this thread. If you want the best value for money, the best setup would probably be:

* Rockwell 6C razor (half the price of the 6S and shaves better imo)
* Any Stirling soap that you think will smell good
* TryAblade sample pack (get 2-3 from some of the brands mentioned here to start. I spend $12 on mine when I started)
* Synthetic brush
* Thayers witch hazel (preferably with alcohol imo)
* Alum block
* Bowl is optional. He could use any wide cup from home if he wanted to try it out but many of us don't use one.

You don't want to get a matching aftershave for a scent that you guys might not like. Thayers is the best starting option as an aftershave imo that has safe scents for a good price/quantity. This should cost around $120 but $70 of that will last him forever (razor and brush) and the rest will last a long time. In terms of quality, he'll have to spend twice as much on a new razor to get things that are marginally better, and many people don't see the need to upgrade past this razor, brush, aftershave combo. If he wanted to experiment with scents and soaps after this, go to Maggard soap/aftershave sample section, but everything is a luxury purchase after he already owns the above items and he should do his own research if he wants something specific."
aww,fepem69,t3_eq4asy,1579318590.0,I wish my cat was affectionate like this. He kinda just sits 5 feet away from me and looks at me.
wicked_edge,feparq0,t1_fenu2mc,1579315991.0,"The 6S uses a similar process as the 6C for its construction (minus the plating). If he wants better tolerances, he'll have to look for something CNC milled."
wicked_edge,fepafjd,t3_eq49pk,1579315762.0,"This is a bit of a problem that often occurs with mirror finishes, sometimes things can look off when they are hit with light at a certain angle. I would inspect every baseplate individually to see if there are imperfections and try to look at the alignment at different angles of light. There's also the possibility that the blade itself is poorly constructed on some sides, which can also look different at the edge depending on how the light hits it. Lastly, there is, of course, the fact that the top cap posts are usually going to have some play with the center cut out of the blade so that it shifts one corner farther out than the other. 

That's something that you will even find in CNC milled razors because they are made to fit all blade types and some blade brands have different tolerances. You can remedy this by holding the blade tabs when you are screwing the handle on and just confirming that it's centred before fully tightening it. You can shift the blade to the center by pushing on the tabs slightly at the moment before it's fully screwed in. 

Perhaps Rockwell could have made the top cap posts a half millimetre thicker, but that's easier to control on something that isn't plated and cast like CNC milled stainless steel or brass. At the end of the day, you get a greatly reduced cost on the 6C because it isn't as precise as a razor can be. You are more than welcome to spend more on something with more precise tooling like a Karve, but at that point, you are no longer looking for the best value for money, which is an award we have to give to the 6C by a large margin."

Quality will eventually be tied to cost in a way that isn't really happening atm as it'll likely be impossible to reduce cost without sacrificing ingredients that give other artisans a competitive advantage."

The economist will say that the capability of the politician to implement such laws is a perversion of the free market, akin to failure, but the sociologist will point out that every system in history with a free market has had such laws. One thinks it's a failure that must be corrected through deregulation, the other understands that this looks more like a feature of free markets that is created and encouraged by it, doing their best to find ways to push people into making the most optimal choices regardless.

I would argue that the sociologist has a more realistic view of how humans will influence policy, so while the economist may present the best option for the most people in the marketplace, they get to watch as politicians implement price gouging laws because they failed to take ""feelings"" into account. Ideally, we would elect people with knowledge of economics, philosophy, sociology, etc so that they have the tools to accomplish both, but, ironically, we don't live in that world because the free market has determined that the skills gained from those fields are of lesser value than others.

At the moment, anytime there is a school shooting the gun companies make a hefty profit because people rush to stock up on weapons in case the state decides to ban them as a result. It seems like a profit motive that could be damaging to our societies, so there is utility in reversing the incentive.

In this sense, it could be a good idea to disincentivize flipping on the Bazaar, as it could decrease the likelihood of someone buying up stocks of shaving goods that would otherwise go to people at decent prices. There's also the chance that some manufacturers may keep a small supply of their limited batch of goods on the off chance that they would gain in value in a few years, selling them off at a higher margin shortly before deciding to reproduce the product.

But then again, ebay exists, so perhaps we are overestimating how much power a subreddit like the Bazaar has in deterring rent-seeking behaviour."

Entry 1: After having made my way through a very large blade sampler pack, I encountered a blade that changed the game for me (Polsilver). All my previous shaves had been rough, barely able to get through my tough stubble, carving up my face due to the requirement for extra pressure, but this blade gave no resistance whatsoever. This was the moment I finally understood how good a shave could be, and how much better it could get. This happened 3 months ago, and I've been trying every other blade type to find a substitute that was a little cheaper.

I've been spending the last month or so pretending that my past/future selves are my best friends.
