Crippling Medical issues are completely different to being orphan or homeless. Also a sleeping person is actually a person, a foetus isn’t.

Finally, what makes an abortion convenient to you? Someone may get an abortion because they were raped, or far too young, or live in an abusive situation, or has mental issues like depression, or would be forced to fuck yo their education and future, or has a large family already and has to put their needs first? A forced pregnancy can be seriously damaging to a person, within their life and mental state. 

(And before you go off about people not being careful, or being sluts, contraception can fail and rape is sadly a thing)

In my opinion you should do what you want with your bodies, need an abortion? Go get one. Don’t agree with them? Don’t get one.

No one goes out to get abortions for the fun of it, it can be a heavy procedure both physically and mentally for anyone. Do what suits you and your life but don’t push it onto others. You clearly don’t agree with it and I wouldn’t force you to have one, have as many kids as you like but your situation doesn’t apply to everyone on the world so let people have control over their bodies"

Just because is foetus is alive doesn’t make them a person, abortions mostly happen to protect the mother who is aware and thinking unlike the foetus. Abortions also occur to prevent a foetus from living a terrible life from medical issues, or dying soon after birth. Abortions are not taking away an innocent life, they’re either protecting one life (the mothers) or to prevent this little clump of cells from growing into a being that will only suffer."

Neutering is internal, not external like cropping and docking, and also improves the quality of life for the animal. 

The point it these practices are to improve quality of life, that’s why we do them. Cropping and docking are completely different as the dog doesn’t benefit from them and it’s often for cosmetic procedures or because people are too lazy to clean their dogs ears. I understand that similar procedures can often improve QOL, such as amputating  a cancer risk or effected ear (common in white cats) or amputating a tail after severe injury but cropping and docking by itself offers no improvement to the actual animal"

AnimalsBeingBros,fdqaqsu,t1_fdq915k,1578661404.0,"Fair enough, but you have to add several factors into this, such as pit bulls have very powerful bites and so would cause far more damage than other breeds- thus meaning more casualties regardless of the number of attacks. Since their bites are more severe, many will get reported far more than those attacked by breeds such as  chihuahuas, as these attacks are often brushed off and don’t require as much medical attention.

Finally pitbulls have a higher chance of being owned by shitty owners, mostly for dogfighting. So when you add all these factors: severe bites, more likely to be reported and more likely to be poorly trained and managed - it does effect the amount of statistics. Just talking about how these breeds are evil solely based on these statistics is flawed, as its not a fair experiment or test as it doesn’t include the outside factors.

Some animals are born fucked up - just like how some people are. But many are the results of poor training and management. This exact mindset was used against Rottweilers and Doberman’s, and now the pitbull is the trendy breed to hate."
