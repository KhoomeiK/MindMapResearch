It's actually a great way to consume a large amount of smoke as it cools it down and you do basically tip it out and drink it."

I am in one of the best spots because any storms from Erie get pushed south by lake Ontario and nor'easters rarely make it this far inland."

l4d2,fea6r3v,t1_fe83wqs,1578944998.0,That hallway is one of the worst places to be tank. Survivors can get behind the door to block spawns except in bathrooms and even then it is difficult to get a hit in as infected. Early tank there is nothing especially with the weapon selection in that room.  If anything staying in the spawn allows the tank to get to the saferoom without dying. At that point just follow it in with whatever you got and it's over.
