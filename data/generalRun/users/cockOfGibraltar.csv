gadgets,feo9fu2,t1_fendd89,1579296910.0,Firewire was more expensive and faster than consumers needed at the time it came out. No one else wanted to push a connector that isn't backwards compatible with anything else at a high price when their isn't a demand for it.
todayilearned,felfgy2,t1_felcc4t,1579220930.0,Typically opt out systems are centered around ID cards or drivers licenses. You have a check box to fill out to opt out when you get issued the ID card. Those who do not have identification are a small minority and wouldn't be organ donors automatically.
todayilearned,felf7t1,t1_felcor9,1579220761.0,What is meant by opt out in almost every implementation is that when you apply for an ID card or drivers license you fill out a form. There is a check box to opt out. You are enrolled by getting an ID card and not checking the box.

Futurology,fdmm3ii,t1_fdmg8b8,1578555153.0,I've taken more than recommended before too. I laid on the forest floor staring at the leaves break into fractals and feeling sticks and contemplating where one individual ends and other objects begin. At the time it felt as of the concept of me as a separate entity was only a figment of my sober imagination and was easily washed away. It was great.

videos,fcxdnt9,t1_fcwi5vf,1578060139.0,I've built many computer and haven't seen a computer fail after getting it in a dented box. I doubt it experienced enough Gs to damage solid state components. If motherboards are so sensitive why aren't they shipped with shock watch stickers. Plus most of the packages you've received have been tossed onto a truck harder than that and it didn't significantly harm the box. If the shipper will replace it go ahead but unless the packaging of the actual part is damaged it's going straight back on the shelf.
videos,fcxd2sr,t1_fcwwgdj,1578059657.0,I've ordered multiple computer cases and they come with enough foam it probably wouldn't be damaged. The handling was rough but if it's packed well it's probably fine.

mildlyinteresting,fc500kb,t1_fc4f5lk,1577436103.0,They have longer springs so you can add different pins etc and shorter springs. It's a learning tool so they aren't really worried about people over lifting all the pins instead of learning how to pick it.
