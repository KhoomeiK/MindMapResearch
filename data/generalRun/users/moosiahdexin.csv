This is just one of the very very few political subs that doesn’t ban anyone who doesn’t fit the description of the sub."
PoliticalHumor,fgkwwk7,t1_fgkwdrq,1580875546.0,"So Bernie endorsing a candidate and a party that he knows is corrupt means he has principles....? 
So basically you’re saying he’s too spineless to change his opinion when presented with the facts. Sounds like the perfect DNC candidate."
PoliticalHumor,fgkvwc5,t1_fgkve6p,1580874833.0,"Lolol I’ve heard that one dozens of times. 

It’s sad I actually had legitimate respect for Bernie Sanders till he laid down and let Hillary walk over him and then gave her his endorsement."
PoliticalHumor,fgkswp7,t3_eyy4tv,1580872883.0,"BAHAHAHAHA ya guys your parties not corrupt. The fucking mental gymnastics is honestly impressive.

LateStageCapitalism,fgk9fha,t1_fgk6lvj,1580860370.0,"Ya bro we spend 1.9 trillion on entitlements and social security literally wont exist when I need it and I’m still being forced to pay into it. I could take the money I will dump into social security and invest it and I could retire a borderline millionaire. But instead I’m forced to pay into a broken system that won’t exist when it’s time for me to get paid. But it’s moral right because the people stealing my money are called the IRS. 

FOH there’s NO way that’s even close to morally comparable to capitalism, a free and VOLUNTARY exchange of goods and services."

If the industry already standardized USB then why in the fuck does the EU have to stick their filthy over reaching noses into it and FORCE a certain change. Why compel companies to do what you want if 1) the consumers are still more than willing to purchase said products 2) the industry has already clearly standardized new technology before. 

Sounds like useless government regulation for the sole reason that they can and people like you are more than willing to allow it. The little shit accumulates... The regulation not being urgently needed is reason enough for it to not exist.

Never in the history of the world does regulation somehow mean MORE innovation happens... how can you regulate something into one standard form and then expect more innovation than if you let other companies and formats compete. 

that may be the stupidest shit I’ve maybe ever heard"
