thisisus,fbecazp,t3_ecwvsn,1576782840.0,It’s just before they focus on him being famous now they don’t did they have to make him a TV movie star at all if it lead to were he is now.i understand now he’s living in a small and he’s turned down movie roles and that’s great .and maybe his fame is decreasing but did him being the manny and doing broadway play and movies lead to anything I just think it all could have been the same if he had a normal job .he still could have got Sophie back .and mess it up if he was a plumber he’s still handsome and Smooth with the ladies.and going forward he goes back to Hollywood and makes movies.then it go’s back to him being Vinny chase from entourage.i just think to it takes away from the believability of them all being a normal family.
