buildapc,fckoboh,t1_fcknygi,1577729666.0,"I dont have a lot of experience with Intel, however; 16gb of 3200 speed or above should do the trick. Most brands are quite reputable nowadays."
buildapc,fckmprv,t3_ehnfwa,1577728674.0,"I think your biggest performance upgrade will come from the upgraded GPU (2070 is great if you can afford it) and possibly higher frequency RAM. Larger SSD would be nice but not necessarily a performance enhancer, unless you are able to play more games on the SSD."
buildapc,fcklwxb,t3_ehp330,1577728185.0,Check your motherboards manual. It should explain which RAM slots you can use for dual channel. You more than likely placed one of the RAM cards in the wrong slot. No worries most of us have been there :)
