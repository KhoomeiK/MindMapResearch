pcgaming,ffc9pl2,t3_est4e9,1579794734.0,"I've only owned 3 R.A.T.'s, first one lasted 4 years. My M.M.O 7 is still going strong, but I moved it to being my at work mouse as it was starting to have a few issues, it still works great just not for FPS games. I bought the new R.A.T. 8+ and I love it, no issues, still has the feel of good construction and quality that I've enjoyed from the R.A.T.'s over the years. Of MadCatz products the mice are honestly the only ones I've ever recommended, so I am sad to hear that you are having as many issues.

For those who would shame me for enjoying them, they are the only mice I have found that fit my large hands comfortable."

ExtremeCarCrashes,fccodp6,t1_fcchln0,1577600736.0,"There is video evidence that the dude took out a bus stop full of people, and walked away without checking on anyone. Now I admit, shock likely played a part in him doing so, as well as alcohol. There are a ton of factors here that all point to it having been a preventable accident if things were done differently. Having read through the articles on this it seems like he is repentant for his actions. I still think he is an asshole for having put himself and others through that situation, though I will say people deserve second chances and I hope he never puts himself in a situation like the one that lead to this video again."

The whole asking for a specific waitress is not a big deal, the part that made me go ""Yikes"" was ""Only eats when specific person can wait on them"", if they would rather leave than have someone else wait on them thats when I get sketched out."
ExtremeCarCrashes,fcapupj,t1_fcao434,1577574192.0,"Maybe, I just feel like he got out went ""Oh fuck"" and then snuck around everything before walking away. But I could be wrong."
