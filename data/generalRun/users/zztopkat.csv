solotravel,fckjv5u,t3_ehk3e3,1577726919.0,"Now I’m in my 60s and I think there is not a lot of opportunity to mingle with other usually younger travelers.  I almost feel invisible when I travel solo or this feeling that others “pity” me or think that I took a wrong turn in my life.  The good part of this is that our generation tends to be more extroverted and we can make friends easily if the language allows.  Having said that I realize that I can chat to nearly anyone, and for others this is very difficult.  In my day I relocated from Philadelphia to Oregon which was really exciting for the 1970s.  
    Now here’s what’s weird, I finally bought a 77 VW Kombi van that I had always wanted and the fact that it found reasons NOT to run almost weekly left me meeting all sorts of unanticipated new friends.  The weird side of this is that now in 2019 when I take my good old van out for a drive I feel like a poser as that van is printed on nearly everything in the world.  
    But I do like having my cell and the web for directions and communication as I am a woman traveling by myself.  I also still wish I had a heater.
Happy New Year!"

roadtrip,fc8lvx4,t3_egq6wf,1577537616.0,"The Redwood Forests on the Northern California Coast.  If the snow level allows then drive through Yosemite National Park.

Remember that you can camp in any USFS National Forest for free for two weeks,  there are hundreds of places in the western US.

Utah:  Bryce Canyon, Zion National Park, Moab and the Canyonlands ,there are just too many to list in Utah alone.

Arizona:  The Grand Canyon.  You can camp all around the park in the National Forest for free and just get close to a town like Tenerife to take advantage of a free shuttle that runs through the park 18 hours a day.

IMO Nevada is a gigantic State to move through as quickly as possible. Go thru Las Vegas and then get to Arizona.


Wyoming:  the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone.  Again, find a place to camp for free in the National Forest around them.  Be respectful and clean up after yourself on public lands.

You may be missing the Pacific Coast which is gorgeous in Oregon and Washington.  You will still have to pay a daily entrance fee into the National parks unless you are a 60 yr old USA citizen with a Golden Age Passport then they are all free.  Have fun!

Ps - hardly any public lands in Texas so limit time there.  It is boring. Really.  Spend time in New Orleans instead.  You will need accommodations in New Orleans
.
 Go to Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico but it’s a long way off the interstate. Stop and see the giant crater in Winslow Arizona.  Skip the petrified forest unless you love geologic history.  Also the Painted Desert is well, kinda ehhh."
