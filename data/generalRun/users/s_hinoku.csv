AmItheAsshole,fcnbjqa,t3_ehzueu,1577808106.0,"This is a difficult one for me but I am more inclined towards NTA. I was given a difficult name from a language barely spoken anymore (Frisian Dutch), in a country in which no one speaks it, and growing up with that was awful. No one could say it. read it or spell it. Both myself and my grandmother, who's name it was, hated it. So, yes, you could be setting the kid up for some difficulties, and trust me 'but I love your name!' is no comfort. Having said that, I think Llwellyn is more known than my name was - especially if you're British(?) I don't really think the act of giving your kid a good name is an act of arsehole-ry as you have good intentions. He can change it later in life, as I did, if he hates it.

However, I think the other peoples' reactions to this is total arsehole-ry."
