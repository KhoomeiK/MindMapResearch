The X750 mobo is for PCIe Gen4 and be future proof.

RAM wise it's to go with 2x 16 in order to be able to buy a second pair later on if truly need it and be at 64. 16 is no longer sufficient for what I do with it. Hell my mini PC I built for 500 bucks (I saved on EVERY front, paid the least I could for the power) I then upgraded to 16 GB, and then I even slapped a 200 bucks 1050ti in there for the sole sake of running Minecraft with shaders LMAO.

The current big tower I have is i7 3930k OC at 4.5 Ghz, 16 RAM (4x sticks), 1060 6GB. It was top notch back in 2013, I don't like to make compromises, and so if I can give more headroom VR wise, AND have a professional rig that lasts me 6+ years, I'm so down."

I bought and sold a Rift, hated the visuals.  I'll argue I'd like the Index better, but I might be disappointed still so I'm banking on being able to FULLY CONSTANTLY reach a high framerate with SS. And if I'm disappointed, with the 1900 setup I'd have room to welcome bigger headsets in the future.

When you haul your ass back with a couple hundred of millions, why would the can with the carbon unit have any importance? Hacking does not mean being super efficient 100% of the time and spending exactly the time it would take to scan it in the first place. You guys are taking this side ways."

If this wasn't a test or a fun little thing to try, just usually carry a scanner with you to know what you hack before hand. I don't even waste time on <3M content.

My attitude shouldn't influence your views on what are facts. I get there are many ways to do things here, but the most efficient one should be the priority, shouldn't it? Hacking 4 cans for a grant total of 200k isn't efficient, sometimes in a site there is only one can worth hacking, you're telling me my few seconds of scans are longer than reaching for every single one of them, and then hacking them, potentially twice? Stop. Get some help."
