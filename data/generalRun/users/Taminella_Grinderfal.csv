science,ffe2m70,t1_ffdu4bq,1579835078.0,"I feel like this is something that shouldn’t be a scientific study. I could make the right decision for me at the time, but down the road my circumstances could be great and I could regret it, but my circumstances might now be great because I got an abortion. There are so many variables that can be taken into account  based on “feelings” which can be so changeable."
MurderedByWords,ffdym06,t1_ffdlif1,1579832169.0,"And you want to improve your circumstances, no way. You can’t afford to take classes, get a degree to get a better job. Oh healthcare? Well if you can’t pay $400 a month screw you don’t get sick. There is enough money to pay people a reasonable wage and provide healthcare but god forbid we tax corporations and bazillionairs and we have to all pay into that and cheap shit we don’t actually need gets a little more expensive."
SandersForPresident,ffdxmqr,t1_ffd9ih6,1579831466.0,"They won’t because the media is telling them to ignore Bernie. I don’t know how to start a revolution, but I feel like we should be outside every media outlet questioning why they ignore him."
UpliftingNews,ffdw9m3,t1_ffdeaj4,1579830496.0,"I’ll give them a little benefit, they don’t understand. I’m older than most redditors and in my younger years I didn’t “get” how someone could be gay or transgender. As I gained life experience and met and was friends with and learned about people and their feelings, I finally “got” it. I’ll never know what it feels like for a brain/heart not to agree with my body/gender norms, but I can support those that do. I can only hope and vote that the discussion continues and laws change."
politics,ffdtzl8,t1_ffdrwbi,1579828880.0,"Yeah because the media (as they did the last time) ignores the candidate that has the best shot r/Bernieblindness. I don’t know how to influence the dnc, letters, calls, protests but they fucked us last time with Hillary ( and then we got extra screwed by the Russians propaganda against her that turned too many on the fence to trump)"
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffaxrab,t1_ffa16lb,1579746946.0,"I am generally against the death penalty as there are many questionable cases and people that truly want to make amends for what they’ve done. And as much as I want to be the person that argues people don’t deserve rape or abuse in prison because they are humans, I’d like to see this guy bounced down a mountainside and then I could be the one to push the button on the electric chair for him."
politics,ffawrly,t1_ffago0e,1579746290.0,This is their job. The fact that any elected politicians can wander out of proceedings or not show up to vote on something. Wtf did anyone elect these people for. And that goes for both parties. I have to go to work every effing day to earn my paycheck. I’m paying these assholes salaries they need to get their asses in the seats.
politics,ffavzi3,t1_ffa8omm,1579745768.0,"It’s not about guilt. They think what he did shouldn’t  be against the law. As long as it’s for their benefit. They impeached Clinton for lying about sex, but it’s cool for this President to destroy the democratic process."

NoStupidQuestions,ff870na,t1_ff7sr9k,1579667799.0,"People ask me how I can rewatch or reread stuff. It’s because I can’t actually recall what happened or the finale. It’s quite enjoyable, generally takes me 2 or 3 times before I get the details. I blame it on distractions, when I was a kid I could focus like a laser and tune out the world reading a book or watching a movie. Now I’m futzing on my iPad watching tv or thinking about grown up shit while trying to read."
quityourbullshit,ff8304o,t1_ff7pxis,1579664635.0,"Our own orange creamsicle of a president criticized her for standing up for her beliefs. While it’s not a “death threat” shouldn’t we have a leader that supports someone like her bringing a serious issue to light? Oh never mind, he doesn’t believe scientists so why shouldn’t he make fun of “some kid”.  ""So ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!"""
quityourbullshit,ff82nzn,t1_ff7islk,1579664389.0,"So at 15 did you put yourself in the media spotlight to bring a world devastating issue to the forefront?  If she can rally people, countries, leaders to start paying more attention to an issue that scientists have been screaming about for years and could save many lives, and that isn’t good enough, what would make her a hero for you?"
videos,ff81rwe,t1_ff7ntqj,1579663734.0,"Yeah a lot of this type of work (seat filling, merchandising, mystery shopping, theatre checking) is independent contractor, meaning you are responsible for everything-healthcare, taxes etc. you can watch movies for a living, but be prepared to go to the same movie multiple times a day, count everyone in the theatre, record trailers and audience reactions for $8 bucks a show, fronting ticket money until you submit a report."
aww,ff7zxtg,t1_ff7byzy,1579662400.0,"When it first came out, it turned my quiet apartment complex into the cutest community.  Everyone was walking around, comparing “notes”.  Yeah it faded out, but it was nice to see people getting to know their neighbors."
BeAmazed,ff7zdh4,t3_es2i7y,1579662002.0,Just wow. If I saw her on the street I’d think “she’s really fit” but not “holy hell she could lift Shaq off the ground.”
science,ff52h7k,t1_ff4ytj9,1579578429.0,Are you a dr? You spent 20 hours they spend years studying and treating. Stop giving out potentially harmful advice based on your experience.  Being a recreational drug user does not make you an expert on a strangers mental health.
science,ff526op,t1_ff4wmgv,1579578207.0,"Please do not do what the other comment suggested. Self diagnosing and treating yourself with street grade drugs could be incredibly dangerous. Seek therapy, do research on possible legit treatments."
Wellthatsucks,ff4rnuv,t1_ff45bsp,1579570804.0,"Do you need two or all four out? Ask a lot of questions and if it’s 4, find someone who will knock you out. I was told “no big deal they’ll take all 4 in like 15 minutes, they’ll just numb you” Took them 2 hours to get 2 out. And take the painkiller before the novacaine wears off."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff4qtah,t1_ff4bmix,1579570221.0,WTF is wrong with people?? God bless my mother for NEVER asking me about babies/relationships.
politics,ff4qb64,t1_ff4fbti,1579569875.0,"It’s not that they think he’s guilty, they think it shouldn’t be against the law. To me that’s scarier."
pics,ff4pnu0,t3_erihrt,1579569426.0,This just warms my heart and makes me remember I was a ruthless child who memorized all the Parcheesi rules and sent my mom “home”  and took all my extra turns like a vengeful god.
therewasanattempt,ff1w4q9,t3_er468n,1579487521.0,I sometimes wish my parents encouraged me a little more in some things. I feel as an adult I’m not “really good/interested” in anything because as a kid  I picked up or dropped things on a whim if it got a little difficult.
progresspics,ff1o7j5,t1_ff0gxwx,1579482486.0,"I’m struggling similarly. It’s hard, but for me some exercise starts me on a good path.  I signed up for a couple fitness classes at the local community college. The set times push me to go because I can convince myself it’s only 45 min class. And sore muscles make me know that I really accomplished something and it keeps me going back.and that then pushes me to want to start eating a little better cause I feel good when I do. And when I have one of those terrible days when it’s all too much I shoot for a “ no zero day” meaning I do at least one thing (take a shower, brush my teeth, walk around the block, whatever)"
relationship_advice,felt3lc,t1_feldsa8,1579230261.0,"I said in another comment, I hope you can let him know how flattering that is. It’s not embarrassing, it should make you feel beautiful and sexy that just a kiss did it for him. It’s a compliment."
relationship_advice,felspyz,t3_eprosd,1579229995.0,"Well this might be the most cute update ever. As to his “accident” assuming it was male excitement from the kissing, I hope you can let him know that’s kinda flattering. From my perspective it would make me feel sexy knowing that he was so attracted."

HumansBeingBros,felqddx,t1_fel46d8,1579228384.0,"As shitty as humanity is generally portrayed most people want to “help” Helping is selfish to the helper it makes them feel good.

IdiotsInCars,felj6iw,t1_fekq00b,1579223452.0,"Cop was out of the car before it even stopped. And the other officer was so calm and respectful as was the victim. In the US the cyclist would have been cuffed, the driver tased to the ground."
WhitePeopleTwitter,feli564,t1_felgsxf,1579222734.0,"I have to disagree, I work for a software company who has no security concerns that would prevent them from hiring an ex con. They required a background check and disclosure of both felonies and misdemeanors.  Companies arbitrarily put extra restrictions in place that don’t allow those that have made mistakes to rebuild after they have paid for their crimes. On top of that, prisons aren’t about rehabilitation, but punishment. They are locked away from society, but on top they are rarely provided the opportunity to educate and better themselves."
ChoosingBeggars,feivuwv,t1_feiu74i,1579148617.0,"Sometimes you see people here on reddit asking how they can stretch to their next check or find assistance. The good ones thank everyone for their advice and take action, the deadbeats take advantage of the kind strangers and suddenly have no issue taking their money through one of multiple avenues that most actual poor people likely wouldn’t know about or have access to."

You just gotta not pick up that next drink...and repeat one at a time. Ask for help, people love to help, you’d be making them happy."
PublicFreakout,fefglyc,t1_fefamm6,1579055896.0,"Hey if you haven’t already check out r/stopdrinking amazing community of people trying to get better. As an alcoholic I was forced to tell people around me (due to my arrest and needing help) you might be surprised at the support you get. And if you don’t, those are people you might consider cutting out of your new, sober life. I thought I could do it alone, and then I nearly ended up in jail. There is nothing that should be stigmatized about choosing not to drink."
news,fefdvj9,t1_feev4q7,1579054221.0,"We live in a world where technology should be allowing us to work less and enjoy more, but instead corporations are forcing us to be constantly connected while they are making mega profits off us, social media is corrupting our perception of reality and happiness. While I desperately hope if you are suicidal you seek help, I also get your perspective on the “grind”. I never really understood depression until the last few years when I finally realized “oh that is me now”."

How can you think it’s ok that we have a president that is destroying our country by tearing apart healthcare and environmental protections for his and his buddies profit  in addition to spending YOUR tax dollars on golf and vacations at his own properties to his advantage. He’s disparaged military families, but is willing to send our troops into a pointless war. I beg of you, educate yourself and give your support of him serious thought if it actually benefits you and the American people."
PublicFreakout,fdm4bqg,t1_fdlrpdk,1578539476.0,She spoke reasonably of her convictions. It was a freak out because she was forcibly dragged from the room. There is another similar vein video where the politician (target of the freak out) remained calm and spoke respectfully to the person and ended up the winner.
