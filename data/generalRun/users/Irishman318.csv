nyc,ff4ls2v,t1_ff2zz02,1579566696.0,"The issue is this is all a side effect of a larger problem, which is the federal government's (lack of) effort to perform any decent amount of immigration reform. The problem is, the current administration doesn't want all of that, because they then lose a bargaining chip to help rile up their base in the short term, and potentially dwindle that base even further over the long term due demographic changes.

The solution is rather simple: make citizenship easier to obtain so people don't have to hide from law enforcement. Then you don't ""entrench a ghetto class"" or whatever bullshit that means, as people are free to do as they please without fear of deportation.

You can rationalize  as much as you want, but the federal government's ass-backward immigration policy killed that woman, not NYC's."
