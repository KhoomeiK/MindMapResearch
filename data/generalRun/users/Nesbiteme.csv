Documentaries,ffflxw7,t3_eta0vq,1579886810.0,"It should now become clear why the old Cold War warriors where so freaking tough recgarding dealing with the USSR. They looked at the intelligence reports everyday. How should one approach dealing with a ""super  power"" that behaves in such a way? Our only response was hypervigilance."
aww,fddwyjx,t3_ekrd3q,1578326004.0,That strange squirrel/chipmunk creature has got some first class bronco busting skills right there partners.
aww,fd5rzhh,t3_ek1row,1578180826.0,Nothing like putting a marsupial on a Roomba and laughing and laughing about it on Reddit. By the way opossums love living in houses with humans they really do. So amazing thanks for sharing this!
UpliftingNews,fd5nf1u,t1_fcu0eep,1578179367.0,"How is the term ""progress"" defined? Increasing the population of desperately poor people by 34% per year, yet providing them with absolutely no prospects for long term survival other than being desperately (marginally more desperately poor) with each birth cycle? Or maybe less people and technologies that provide those people who are here with some level of existence that is not shockingly desperate? Your statement that my criticism is akin to ""There is a raging environmental and economic problem driven by overpopulation which is the cause of not other problems but all our problems existential but the solution is MORE PEOPLE! Once they get here well that is up to God."" Makes absolutely no sense."
UpliftingNews,fd2xz8f,t3_ejts05,1578152814.0,"Let's do the math: 500,000,000 animals (just animals not the people of property) $500,000/500,000,000 = $0.001.. This is not uplifting, it is actually very depressing and misleading. Make us all feel okay about the damage we do to the environment daily.  Burning coal in my SUV to go 20 yards to an all you can eat buffet at the Applebees IT'S OKAY because Pink is donating $500,000 in a trillion upon trillions of dollar disaster. Pass me some ribs."
UpliftingNews,fcsfwvk,t3_eij2k6,1577915948.0,"This is wrong for all the wrong reasons. GM golden rice is a basic subsistence commodity. So we feed but do not nurosh the fed. Quality of life matter more than quantity of carbs and one vitamin. Jobs, education, clothing, clean air, clean water....feeding is not nourishing. This is not ""upliftingNews"" it is news but really very sad and depressing. Americans tend to conflate quantity of something with quality of something that is a big mistake."

aww,fcobbze,t3_ei5pqk,1577828072.0,"There is a CatReddit where cats post pictures of their two legs and you are there and the caption reads ""Meow, Mewo mew Mewo mew mew"" which translated from cat is ""Happy New Year CatReddit! We're were about to take a nap and the two legs wanted to head bumpsies, so I did it so I could take my nap. Got to love those two legs."""

If you mean by we are a media company a click bait shit click hole company like Reddit then just keep churning out garbage that makes people want to keep on clicking. Good luck."
