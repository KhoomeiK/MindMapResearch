depression,fc3or8l,t1_fc3oh8i,1577394849.0,I agree with the sentiment of seeking help but fuck man how could you think saying this is an okay thing to do given the situation. Like goddamn use your brain
depression,fc3onst,t3_eg10e5,1577394782.0,Don’t do either of those things. Seek the help from someone or something that doesn’t involve harm. And if all you can think of is that then just punch your pillow until you cry. Usually helps for me
depression,fc3ogk5,t1_fc2ifrx,1577394637.0,I hardly ever cry but when I do it’s very relieving. I feel like I use jokes as more of a deflection because it doesn’t actually make me feel any better. Half the time I end up just thinking about how true my depressing joke was and I get more depressed
