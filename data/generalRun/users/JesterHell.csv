science,fgka77z,t3_eyp2nd,1580860861.0,">suggest that early social experiences can shape altruism.

Its this, nothing more nothing less, the human brain is a biological learning machine, from the moment it is ""switched on"" it is absorbing data, its not that human are intrinsically altruist but that humans have an intrinsic capacity for altruism.

Interact with a wide enough selection of children and you'll see a big difference between the ones that are taught from birth and the ones that a raised with a more ""feed them, clean them, wait for them to become people"" approach, children and babies need those initial lesson for altruism to be learnt, parents in the second ""wait for them to become people"" group are unlikely to participate in studies like this.

The flaw I see with studies like this is that any parent that would sign up to have their new born tested for altruism are more likely to have already started the training and indoctrination processes.

The was a scientist who's name I forget that tried an experiment with raising a child without human contact, that is the only way to truly determine the base state, take new born and never teach it anything, is it still altruistic? if it has never received any kind of positive reinforcement in the form of a smile or laugh for sharing or being kind will it still share and be kind?

Because if the child has received positive feedback before the test occurred during general parenting then the test was not going to be truly accurate, doesn't matter if the experimenter does not show reciprocity if the child is already conditioned for altruism by its parents though though their unconscious use of smile/frown responses.

The main reason I don't trust the studies like this is they treat the raising process as a part of the default state, but its not, the moment the parents start interacting with the child it is learning from them so what behaviour is inherent and what is learnt can only be determined by not allowing behaviours to be learnt before the testing.

The only way to get truly accurate results is with inhumane experiments, anything else will be contaminated by the preconceived notions of correct behaviour impressed upon the child by its environment and carers."

explainlikeimfive,ffvaawl,t3_ev99yv,1580259410.0,"I'll start by saying I'm not an expert but my reasoning is as follows.

First, what does ""proficient"" mean? the text book definition of proficient just means ""competent"", not expert or master.

You get enough of the needed practice to be generally competent in the class room, mastering something takes a lot more practice but general competency can get covered in the classroom.

Even without homework you get enough reinforcement in maths and language throughout school that, provided you do the in class work you will end up competent, this is why going from high school where competency is the goal to university where expertise is the goal is such a dramatic shift.

You also need to consider other effects that homework has, homework cut into out of school hours, reducing the child's ability to relax and de-stress after school and that can effect in school academic performance, happy humans are better learners so ensuring that children have enough free time to de-stress is just as important as the subjects themselves.

&#x200B;

An other way of looking at it is as follows, it takes,

10 pieces of work to become an amateur.

100 pieces of work to become a novice

1000 pieces of work to become competent

10000 pieces of work to become an Expert

100000 pieces of work to become a Master

Homework might take a child from 1200 pieces of work on the subject to 1800 pieces of work but it wont get the child to the next ""level"" of skill so its hard to measure exactly how much good it does the child.

Honestly the only good argument for homework I've ever heard was that homework is not about reinforcing the subject in the homework but is instead aimed at teaching self study skills, but some schools have self study periods to enable student to work on that skill in class where a teacher can provide assistance and direction as needed.

Not every child's parents can or will help with homework so imho its better to include self study as a school subject instead of homework so every child gets the same education, if some parents want to teach their children extra it is just that, extra."

I think society needs a balanced system and that means having some capitalism and some socialism, luxuries can be capitalist but necessities need to be socialist, if you let either capitalism or socialism become dominant you'll have an unbalanced system, so I think the luxury systems should be used to support and fund the necessity systems.

My stance is basically that Healthcare, education and justice systems should not in anyway shape or form be connected to profits, there should be no such thing as private for profit hospitals, schools or prisons (HSPs), when private for profit HSPs exist they act like a societal cancer eating away at the non-profit HSPs."

I think a good analogy is Europe, they're all Europeans (Chinese) but they have no problem dividing themselves between a French, German, Polish, Italian, Spanish etc.

A quick google search lead to this Wikipedia [list of Ethnic groups in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_China) which says there are 58 ethnic groups in China and even if there isn't that many different groups we've all heard about the Uyghur so there are at least some different ethnic groups.

Maybe china was testing something on a ""undesirable"" ethnic group and it got out of hand, I mean [the US infected its own citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States) before I don't see why China wouldn't.

Edit: There is no guarantee they did something this stupid but given China track record on  human rights and transparency I can't say its not a possibility, what better way to wipe out a group of undesirables without political fallout then them just dying of some random disease.

That being said the conclusion that effecting the environment is morally wrong results in all life being evil, the environment as we know it is a result of life effecting the environment, the origin of our oxygen rich atmosphere is thought to a Cyanobacteria so that conclusion does seem nonsensical, but again it is possible for life itself to be evil depending upon the criteria you use."

Edit: I did not say anything about morality or ethics, from the perspective of legality freeing slaves in the south was criminal technically making the underground railroad a criminal organisation.

The law is not about morality or ethics but maintaining a orderly and stable society, things that destabilise society are branded as criminal by those that benefit from the status quo, so from the perspectives of southern slave owners freeing slaves was criminal just like the actions of environmental and/or animal activists are getting branded as criminal by big business and the politicians who campaigns they donate to."
