xbox,ffc5rt1,t1_ff8ah2h,1579792180.0,I agree with this guy. I've been console since snes and last year I got my gaming PC  and have since upgraded a few things on it. No regrets and no money will make me go back to console. Especially when Microsoft are merging so much between PC and Xbox anyway.

skyrim,fejiftq,t3_epfr2x,1579175659.0,On PS4 you can only play around with stuff already in the game.  Rule of thumb is if you see a mod with something that is not already in the game. PS4 can't have it.
