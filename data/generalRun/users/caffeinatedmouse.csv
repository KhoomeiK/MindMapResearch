Frugal,fdh6249,t3_eky2x6,1578416153.0,Curious to see some of these suggestions as I‚Äôm also tired of spending a small fortune every few months just for a trim and highlights.

declutter,fcuopig,t3_eii6ew,1577985456.0,"Since it‚Äôs post-holidays, we went through all our Xmas stuff and filled a box with stockings and decorations to donate. Everything else went back into storage. For bathrooms, I tossed any expired makeup and decided that I don‚Äôt need 3 containers of various face moisturizers. One went into my purse to use as hand lotion, one on the bedside table to use up ASAP. No more buying unless I‚Äôve used something up!"
AskReddit,fcuo4qi,t3_eiweq4,1577985125.0,"Met up with a guy from an online dating site in my early 20s. He profile stated he was British and went on about how much women love his accent (should‚Äôve been a red flag). Met him for a drink, no accent (more of a lisp, which isn‚Äôt an issue but he had lied about it), he spent the entire date trying to convince me to come back to his apartment for ‚Äúmuch better drinks‚Äù and when I declined and got ready to leave he got pissed off and said ‚Äúwell you weren‚Äôt exactly honest in your profile, you‚Äôre clearly a lot older than you said you were.‚Äù I was 23 at the time. See ya never dude."
AskReddit,fcuj2ol,t3_eixc75,1577982137.0,"After many failed attempts and bad dates with other guys, I met my husband on Plenty of Fish in 2011. From the first date it was just so easy, fun, we had lots in common and most importantly, he made me laugh. We got married in 2015 and I‚Äôve never had a single regret. We are still each other best friends. Online dating was like wading through a pool of douchey piranhas but it was also worth it to find my fish."
nobuy,fcriyjk,t3_eikxjn,1577902431.0,"These are really good suggestions! A lot of people don‚Äôt like the idea of not buying books but I found I actually started reading way MORE when I got my library card. I was able to borrow more books than I would‚Äôve been able to afford to buy, although we do give the library a donation here and there when we can."

glutenfreecooking,fcksi5v,t1_fcks5s9,1577732234.0,"This is good advice! Thank you. I always forget that trying new gluten free recipes sometimes takes me a few tries, and I should embrace that as part of the learning curve. It‚Äôs a process!"
glutenfreecooking,fckrnkn,t3_ehmk2w,1577731713.0,This looks amazing! This makes me want to try making one of my own.
Frugal,fch5175,t3_egrc03,1577647379.0,"We have a Costco membership and while it can be dangerous (will get to that) it has saved us a lot of money on food since they have a wide variety of gluten-free and organic items. Things we buy there: GF bread, GF pasta, rice, quinoa, organic canned goods (chickpeas, black beans, diced tomatoes), protein powder, meat, tofu, frozen fruit, eggs etc etc etc. My gluten free products are much cheaper there which keeps us going back since it‚Äôs not a choice for me to eat regular gluteny things. We also fuel our car there and save quite a bit on that, and when we needed a new mattress we got one at Costco for much less than the other stores in town. The dangerous part is that because you find ‚Äúsuch a good deal!‚Äù you can end up with things you didn‚Äôt need and then when they ring up the total you end up spending much more than planned. Basically take a list and stick to it!"
