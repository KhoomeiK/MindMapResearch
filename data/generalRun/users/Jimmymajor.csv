In the meantime, little me had to learn that 1- my mom never wanted another son, 2- my only use was to be a little trophy to mother friends, 3- she wanted me to live with her for all my life. 

It was like my old me meeting myself today. My gf is preg with 2 boys. I don't speak with my mom for a year now, and I'm happy. I cried amidst a mix of pain, relief and pure hate."

Lunox is hard. I would suggest to play lots of brawl. It's a nice place to learn any hero's basic. 

I think Bruno is really easy. Bane (but he doesn't sustain to higher ranks) is probably one of the easiest IMO."

DecidingToBeBetter,fejydi1,t3_epj7j5,1579188656.0,"Here I am with the advice you parents were always scared of. What I did was:

1- hypnotherapy. 
2- marijuana. 
3- ayahuasca.
4- Exercise. 

These are some quick, almost hack ways of getting in touch of loving yourself again.

Don't do any of this without 100% prior knowledge. Make yourself strong by educating yourself. Surround you with information you ACTUALLY need to survive and understand why you hate what you have."
explainlikeimfive,fejvfvr,t3_epglsj,1579186765.0,"You start your life with your ID (some animal instincts, for better or worse) and your SUPEREGO in teen years (the anxious brat inside you telling what's right from wrong). That's a mammal trait. We don't fully develop in our mommas belly. (REF: Freud)

Adulthood comes and u develop your EGO. This new fellas judge everything around you. SUPEREGO don't want anything that isn't worth your time. He just want you to survive. (REF: Carl Jung)

There's a lot of studies putting children on early years in contact with random arts and sports. They all become aces (REF: Lazlo Polgar). Child also learns language faster (REF: Paulo Freire).

TL;DR: some brains learn to judge less some specific themes than others."

Also, anyone else think that the professional in charge of character design is other guy rn? The new releases seems deeply different (the drawing of newer skins seems to evoke that)"
AskReddit,fe8awuu,t3_envws2,1578924335.0,"I love some minigames. It can get awkward in the beginning, but the secret is to not follow any rules and handle with ease. 

- search for ""36 questions that lead to love"". Switch answering you and your partner 
- use ""would you rather""? And say the dumbest shit possible. Escalate to personal intimacy things later.
-  ask ""10/10 fucks we had. The one who can't remember one, loses"". U can always end it with ""wanna do one rn?""
- go with ""shits I would never do in bed... until now"""
