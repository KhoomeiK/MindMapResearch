UniversalOrlando,ff9cnpw,t1_ff93m4p,1579710006.0,"I work in food and bev and the scheduling is an issue. I haven't had this problem, but several of my coworkers will get scheduled a late shift and an early shift (like 2 pm - 10:30 pm, then 5am - 2 pm). I don't know hope much of the schedule is auto-generated and how much is made by the supervisor, but that's not okay to me. In my specific department, we were supposed to have a remodel done and we were scheduled to close early to have this done. The day that was supposed to happen, the contractors didn't show up (I guess? We get limited communication at our level) and we were told to resume normal hours, two hours before when we were supposed to close early. Similar problems have happened several times with that, resulting in people being called in early or being expected to stay late beyond their scheduled time. I get things happen, but within all the circumstances, it feels incredibly insulting to your employees' time to just expect them to shift their whole schedule on a whim because someone else can't get their shit together. Also, we only get our schedule 4 days in advance (so I'll get next week's schedule this Thursday). 

That aside, I do like the company and most of the people I work with, and of course this is only my experience with my particular department so far."
