The key finding a correlation that Christian displaced persons following the Lebonese Civil War will be less likely to return to their village if it experienced a massacre or has a higher proportion of Muslims. They also found a positive causal effect for economic opportunities on the likelihood that Christians return. The causal effect is found leveraging a natural experiment in global olive oil demand to ensure exogeneity and using a difference-in-difference design to address omitted variable bias.

While this may seem obvious, this is an important study because it confirms various theories by studying it in a systematic way. It is also important bc it is a typically understudied aspect of civil war settlement."

2. These questions are answered in the methods section on page 5 and 6 of the paper. The paper uses Fox News for completely apolitical reasons; it uses Fox News bc its rollout can be treated as a natural experiment (the authors note other studies that use a similar identification strategy). I'm sure if the rollout for CNN or some liberal station was similar then they would have looked at it.
3. Yes, the estimates found in this study are causal unless you have some specific issues with there methods and the assumptions they made (which they defended, as you can find in the paper)."

That is not what parallel trends is. It is that the treatment and control group are trending consistently in the hypothetical scenario that neither group had received the treatment, that's why you can't ever directly test it (bc the treatment group ultimately receives the treatment). 

Because the treatment effect has a nonzero impact, clearly the outcome variable will change between pre and post for the treatment group (since the treatment has an effect)."

science,fcrnfhv,t1_fcrjni6,1577904099.0,I disagree. You have not provided any compelling reason why the estimates in this study would be biased. Saying you can't get any credible estimates from anything other than an RCT is both false and incredibly limiting. RCTs have there own issues as well.

science,fcri4qo,t1_fcolc2t,1577902120.0,"They used difference in difference, which provides an unbiased estimator as long as parallel trends is satisfied. So unless you have a compelling reason to the contrary, they have showed causality."

science,fcrh26m,t1_fcp5c8p,1577901731.0,"Well any study that has hypothesis testing makes assumption, it just depends on how comfortable you are in those assumptions and how compelling the author is in dispelling concerns about violations in the assumptions. From my point of view, you are claiming that this paper is not causal bc DD has assumptions, which is essentially a noncomment bc all papers make assumptions. If you have a problem, why don't you give us some specific reasons that you think parallel trends in this case might be violated (recognizing we are limited due to not having an ungated paper and not knowing what the authors did to test the assumption).

Parallel trends assumes consistent trends in control and treatment groups...which is necessarily untestable bc the treatment group receives a treatment. But that doesn't necessarily break the study bc you can conduct tests that get at how well that assumption holds."
science,fcp4gqp,t1_fcp2xpi,1577850172.0,"I have no reason to think that parallel trends has been violated and you haven't provided me with compelling evidence to the otherwise so your OP feels a bit unwarranted. We aren't making an assumption about anything outside the observed range, were making an assumption about the behavior of the treatment as if they never received the treatment. Since we don't have an ungated version of the paper we can't say whether or not the authors try testing the assumption."
science,fcp25h7,t1_fcp0jlg,1577848162.0,They used a difference in difference design (see year and state fixed effects) which provides an unbiased estimate unless the parallel trends assumption is violated. Do you have reasons that believe that assumption has been violated?

Well the study uses a Difference-in-difference design, so this isn't necessarily a concern for causality. What you would care more about the parallel trends assumption. Do you have an issue with that assumption being violated?"
