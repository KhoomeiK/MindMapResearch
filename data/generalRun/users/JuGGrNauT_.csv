CrazyHand,fg4dvqa,t1_fg4cyyk,1580501669.0,"Tripping people for a poking tool like dtilt or maybe sour ftilt, is a good thing; but (correct me if i'm wrong) upsmash is for catching people landing on plats, mixup potential etc. So it tripping when you're trying to kill wouldn't help.."

CrazyHand,fg3dweh,t1_fg3cy9r,1580478973.0," You're spreading misinformation and you need to stop. Chroy's and Sonic's upsmashes received reduced tripping. So yes it's a ""buff"" but i agree it should be considered a mediocre buff not a actual one

And what mistakes did you point out? All you did was get mad when people started downvoting you lmao"
CrazyHand,fg3dtgm,t1_fg3dejm,1580478911.0,Stuff like Chroy and Sonic's upsmashes have reduced tripping etc. Should be considered minor to be fair
