Even better, I don't get charged if I get a day off so I can let her know last min that I don't need them looked after. Most babysitters charge you whether they're there or not.

From what I've seen, there are several types of Musk haters:

3. Those who have long doubted the success of his ventures and want to see him fail to validate their prediction (they don't like being wrong, and some are jealous of the wealthy)

As an employer, he has a reputation for being a hard-ass with high expectations, so I'm sure there are former/current spiteful employees who would call him a prick. He's also outspoken on social media, going so far as to call someone a pedo without providing evidence.

I might also throw in oil companies, car companies, and any other entity affected by his disruptive progress. Don't underestimate the media's ability to slander.
