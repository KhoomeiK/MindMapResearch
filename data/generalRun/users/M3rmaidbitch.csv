No insurance throughout any of it so that wasnt the reason either."
LifeProTips,fdoee3c,t1_fdlyz7q,1578603571.0,"So sorry about your disc herniation, got a friend dealing with it as well and it is hell. If you are renting, have you considered moving to an apartment complex that has a pool already? As a broke college student with a roommate, we easily found many complexes with pools that we could afford. Memberships suck, so it's awesome knowing our apt comes with one. 

Also theres weight training! I'm no expert by any means, but got a few lifter friends who swear by it over cardio."

SuicideWatch,fcwu8yc,t3_ej4wzo,1578037849.0,"OP I am so sorry for your struggles and feelings of dread... I have lost 2 close friends to suicide, and almost a family member as well... Please read all of these comments... Life sucks so bad sometimes, but then it doesn't anymore. It gets better always. I have to remind myself of this all the time. Life changes. Situations change. We grow... I feel like i was a struggling 16 year old only yesterday... but I am 29 now and I look at my life and I'm so happy for every experience I've had... The good AND the bad... because these are what shape you, what gives you strength... Dont throw in the towel just yet. Please.   


I have been there, school shit, sexual assault, an abusive parent, betrayal, anxiety, hospitals, body issues, depression, substance abuse, you name it....  I look at it all and I am still proud because through all the bad, I came out okay, scars and all.  Fight back. take back your life and own everything. <3"

Advice,fcwtg2h,t1_fcu2qg8,1578036905.0,"Thank you so much for putting in this much time to help a stranger out. I definitely will be coming back to this and rereading it as the year progresses. I'm setting up a payment plan with the IRS, and still gunning for better jobs out there. Hopefully my luck will change. I guess I just need to stay positive. I've definitely have had worst years and despite all the hardships now, I am grateful for the things that are still good in my life. Your words really helped me. Thank you stranger."

Vent,fctx9d4,t1_fctvt8e,1577964180.0,"It's been really hard honestly, never thought I'd post something this personal on reddit but here I am. My group is small, which I usually like but when most of your group is contributing to the issue, you feel stuck. My mom already dislikes my best friend, so I can't really expect unbiased advice... and my boyfriend has repeatedly apologized and has tried to prove otherwise concerning the marriage topic but I'm just so indifferent now.  I wish I had a therapist honestly. Or a wise old grandparent to confide in. 
All in all I'm just waiting for one good day. One win. Anything really to just respark my natural optimism. 
I'm struggling to be okay. Definitely not suicidal, never have been, so that's a good thing, but yeah I wish there was a way for us broke kids to see a therapist."
Vent,fctuhvd,t1_fctu83i,1577960183.0,"Thank you for your kind words friend, 
One positive in that situation specifically is that I have a lot of leverage to hold over the company that can be used for exchange of payment. (It was a video marketing company) so all the footage is legally ours and if they continue to use it, I can sue. Hopefully that is incentive enough to prompt payment. 
Either way, just reading encouraging words helped fill me with some hope. Thank you"

My boyfriend and I take clothes to our churches and goodwills frequently and are both sized Mediums, perhaps we can send you some essentials!  If you live in an apartment we can maybe send things to the leasing office with your name that way your apt# is safe! Or PO boxes work too! We have all been there my friend, and it is hard as hell... but you will get through it, and all of reddit is rooting for you."
venting,fcttpsz,t1_fbzm76w,1577959023.0,"I second this! After every cheated breakup, I needed time alone to recover and rebuild. Too easily can you bring the hardships and distrusts from a previous relationship into a new one, and that never ends happily... Do things for you right now bud, rebuild and you'll be okay. I promise. And once the next person comes around that you deserve, youll be ready for them."
