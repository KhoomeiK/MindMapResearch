worldnews,fg3jqyl,t1_fg332og,1580483197.0,"Your argument assumes that the people of the US military would willingly take up arms against their own countrymen.  I'm not saying it's impossible, but that is indeed a huge assumption.  I can't imagine how dark a day it would be when American soldiers would willingly fire into crowds of protestors, for example, or deploy aircraft against us cities.  

Obviously anything could happen, but the idea of bearing arms as a defense against tyrrany doesn't require that civilians be able to *defeat* the us military in armed conflict, just to make it horrible and uncomfortable enough that cooler heads prevail and prevent it from ever getting to that point."

For the record - I agree that no one should be forced to inhale smoke.  As if that's a real concern."
Wellthatsucks,ffzz21j,t1_ffzxyoj,1580396496.0,"Speak for yourself.  For *you* all this may be correct.  I know plenty of people who smoke daily for 20+ years who are extremely responsible, highly functioning professionals in all kinds of different fields.  

It's bizarre to me that many people would see nothing wrong with having a glass of wine or a beer after work but think mj is any different.  In my experience cannabis is far less damaging than alcohol in literally every way.  

Certainly it's not for everyone - my wife doesn't like the feeling for example - but for plenty of people it's essentially harmless."

politics,ffxywfc,t1_ffxp51u,1580335150.0,"This shit is disturbing.  The way he manhandles the Gardners' daughter in the red dress is horrifying.  If a man repeatedly touched my 12-13 year old daughter like that I'd probably get arrested.  He repeatedly grabs her arm right up under her armpit near her breast, and it's not a subtle or polite nudge to direct the girl where to stand (which would be totally ok), he agressivly grabs her arm so she can't get away.  And at one point puts his hand on her chest where her dress meets her bare skin.  Then the next group comes up with the three blonde daughters and the first question is ""how old are you?"" to each of the girls.  He doesn't ask how old the boys are or even acknowledge them.  

I hate to say it but I really think the guy has some dark secrets.  I never would have thought that was the case a few years ago - I just thought he was an out of touch old guy - but these videos are pretty damning evidence of some very disturbing behavior.  It's clear to me he feels perfectly comfortable taking liberties with others' body and space, and has a need to control people he has power over (which as vice president means basically everyone).  And just like this new Iowa video, he can grab or manhandle anyone he wants knowing he has armed guards watching his every move so they can't even push his hands away.

How the fuck is he allowed to continually do this over and over again.  What a creep."
