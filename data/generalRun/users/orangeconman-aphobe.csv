IdiotsInCars,ffc4cqg,t1_ffbws28,1579791222.0,"The frameworks to ensure responsible ownership are already in place> Nobody is forcing these people to take these guns and shoot up a place.

But that is the issue at hand.  The mentally unsound really believe that ""society"" forces them to kill others.  How many times have we heard of murders making excuses that ""If she didn't overlook my love I wouldn't have shot the place up""  or the ""disrespect"" culture.  It's all nonsense to a rational person but to those that have diminished mental capabilities it makes perfect sense.  This is why mental health checks are important factors that must be included for firearms purchases.  It does not stop the average person from purchasing a firearm.

\>The frameworks to ensure responsible ownership are already in place

You are correct, and just like any other ""framework"" you needs to add the components to it to make it whole.  Presently, we have components missing that need to be affixed.

\> Some people actually kind of wish that the agencies like the ATF keep making more and more ridiculous rules

The ATF does not make nor do they pass the 2nd Amendment.  Anyone suggesting that a simple rule from them would override the Constitution is simply blowing hot air to rile up the base.  A rational person could dismiss nonsense like this easily, but in many instances we are not talking about rational people.

\> You mention rational people, many of whom have simply never shot a gun,  or don't know how the process works to actually get a gun

I know the process, I own and have owned several firearms.  I've shot at the range, and have shot downrange when I needed to.  I do understand what weapon ownership means and why it is important.  What is more important though is the need to guard against those that should not possess or own a firearm."

IdiotsInCars,ffc32ls,t1_ffbzaii,1579790319.0,"Yes, I understand the cost of safely (no pun, really) storing your firearms is and will be expensive.  I personally have no issue with firearms, I see them as a tool that can be used for various lawful purposes.  What I have an issue with is the ease that one can get a firearm legally without so much as a background check, even if you are a stark raving lunatic.  

My belief that storage of said weapons should not be an afterthought, as many decent quality firearms can cost between 1/2 a grand to 2000 thousand dollars.  Why wouldn't I purchase a gun safe for $1500 to place my Springfield Armory M-14, My $500 Colt 1911A1, and my $500 Mossberg 12 gauge into when I am not using them?  instead, I have friends with AR's behind doors in their homes ""just in case"", or 40 cal. in the top drawer of their night stands, or worse, under their pillows..."
