AmItheAsshole,ffamb5x,t3_esd1z8,1579739292.0,NTA FOREVER and from someone who is child free but not sure if I made the right choice I appreciate your 100% honesty here. I wish more people were as real as you on this subject.
AmItheAsshole,ffaljij,t3_erz12v,1579738766.0,Sounds like he was trying to use guilt to manipulate you into doing the fetish stuff even though you drew a very clear boundary there. Either way this person's utter lack of concern for your health and well being are a huge red flag.

AmItheAsshole,ff7v48s,t1_ff6dmrt,1579659081.0,THIS 100%. She should have said this up front. Not assume that everyone knows her specific dietary limitations then throw a fit afterwards when those needs werent met. Sounds really immature.
AmItheAsshole,ff7und9,t3_erwdex,1579658769.0,"NTA technically but I feel bad for her. I moved across country once and just knowing how hard it is I would hang out with her just purely out of kindness. Of course you don't owe her anything but there are things I do for my neighbors and people in my community that I don't technically ""owe"" them that I do anyway just because I like living in a nice community, and because the neighbors are nice people and i know if I ever needed anythig they would jump in to help, and everyone is super nice and its all reciprocal.

Now if she came at you in a pushy or entitled way. No. But if she came at you in a sort of ""hey would you be open to doing this with me, i'm sort of all on my own and could really use a friend"" then yeah I would definitely step in and be the helpful friend . It's not hurting you any and you're technically helping someone and making the world a better place."

M1Finance,fev6p19,t1_feurkwx,1579393740.0,Thanks that makes sense! See I knew there was some pentalty with Roths thats why I made the M1 just a regular account bc I knew I wanted to be able to take money in and out whenever i want without worrying about penalties. Plus aren't there limits to how much you can contribute on a roth?

M1Finance,fev4wwe,t1_feuoa0r,1579393130.0,"Wait so lets say, in theory, I made my M1 account a Roth IRA. Lets say I put in 10k and made like $1000 in returns on my investment. If I wanted to withdraw the $1000 for whatever reason before I was 59.5 I would not pay a penalty or get taxed on that return money?"
M1Finance,fev2tgp,t1_feurw1r,1579392515.0,"Thanks! I'm self employed and have both. I put pre-tax money in the regular IRA sometimes, basically whenever my accountant tells me to LOL.

The Roth is a different story. I put money in that all the time.

I have a 3rd investment account which is M1. The timeline for the M1 money is 5-10 years. Do you think it should be an IRA?"
M1Finance,feun3e4,t3_eqkzi6,1579388105.0,"OK soooo, addressing a misconception I had here... If you make an IRA account on M1 its TAX FREE and YOU CAN WITHDRAW WHENEVER YOU WANT with no penalty?

I thought IRA accounts were set up where you would get a penalty if you withdrew before 65 or something like that...? Can someone explain this? I think I need to close down my regular account and make a Roth IRA if this is true..."
M1Finance,feumgpb,t1_feu2idx,1579387919.0,"Yeah I don't know why more people don't ditch the fees either. But I'm lowkey hoping M1 stays a secret so it doesn't blow up and they don't start charging fees. 

I'm actually curious about your overall financial picture. No pressure to answer any of these of course, but I just thought I'd ask..

Are you doing FIRE?

 If this is your aggressive account how much do you have stashed away in your more conservative accounts?

Did you withdraw the 10k or just leave it in there?

Not trying to be nosy I'm just admiring the 10k in 2 weeks strategy and wondering how you got there."
M1Finance,feu0gwj,t3_eprubc,1579381900.0,This is the first time I saw someone with +100k in their M1. I was beginning to think M1 was only for smaller sized investments. Sick.
M1Finance,fetzf7n,t1_feptkaj,1579381555.0,"Whuu? I thought you pay a penalty if you withdraw from your IRA accounts before you're like 65 or something?

Anyhow, here's my pie. I'm realizing that picking random stocks willy nilly is kind of stupid and I'm gonna try to sell off some. Rn I have 69 holdings and last night when I tried to add some index funds it said Ive reached the max of 100 holdings..

relationships,feta4z9,t3_eqgltz,1579373211.0,Def sounds like a chop shop. What regular shop would be working all night like that? He's not telling you so you wont be an accessory if he gets caught.
M1Finance,fepd5d1,t3_emy42m,1579317591.0,"I'm not from a very investment literate family, so my goal with M1 is to teach myself how to trade stocks and etfs and also get over my fear of putting larger and larger sums of money into the market as I'm trying for lean fire in 5-10 years.

BTW my background is that I'm self employed and have 2 retirement accounts with Vanguard. Roth and regular IRA. I fund those every month but the way Vanguard is set up it seems like they have like either $1000 minimum or $3000 minimum to buy their funds so that is why I also have M1.

M1 is actually a lot of fun and lately I find myself addicted to it. (Anybody else addicted to trading?) So the money I have in M1 is like retirement money, but it can be invested a bit more aggressively than the Vanguard stuff. Right now my portfolio is mostly blue chip companies and whatever other tips i managed to pick up from here and lurking in r/personalfinance

I'm also wondering...for the people that are trying for FIRE, do you fund your IRA accounts? And if so do you worry that if you FIRE before the IRAs reach maturity that you will have to pay the early withdrawl penalty? Or do people who FIRE just keep all their money in regular brokerage accounts?

Also, is it bad if you have too many holdings? Like 40 ?

And can you have multiples pies?

Thanks!"
relationships,fep4q12,t3_eq5ays,1579312086.0,"It kind of sucks how society socializes women to feign interest in their partners hobbies. FTS. Do your own thing and dont let anybody shame you for it. They sound boring don't feel like you have to pretend to be interested in their lives. They certainly aren't doing that for you.

Also if my bf asks me to do stuff with his friends or family i dont want to do i just politely say ""Thanks but im doing [insert one of my hobbies, or seeing x friend that day]"" He gets it and is never mad.  you're dating him not his family."

I think the problem with kids is that they latch on to you if you pay attention to them. Maybe youngest sister doesn't want this slippery slope of saying yes once to devolve into her becoming the default babysitter. 

Sounds like person who hates kids need to move out and get her own place bc her sister and bother don't respect her boundaries. Forcing someone to babysit who doesn't like kids is a TERRIBLE IDEA FOR THE KID. So no amount of coercion on the part of the family is going to make this situation right, even if it would be the 'polite' thing to do... ESH."
