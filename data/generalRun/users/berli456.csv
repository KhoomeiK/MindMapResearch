I honestly shouldn't have offended you, and for that I apologize, but you do need to read more carefully during internet arguments."
PublicFreakout,ff4xtpd,t1_ff4xnlh,1579575037.0,Was there an argument other than you questioning my ability to understand Spanish? Because I answered that.

>The belief that God has created the universe but remains apart from it and permits his creation to administer itself through natural laws. **Deism** thus rejects the supernatural aspects of religion, such as belief in revelation in the Bible (see also Bible), and stresses the importance of ethical conduct."

dogs,fdmmmjr,t3_em5c6b,1578555763.0,"My dog used to do the same thing when I first adopted him. I just did the same thing my parents did to me when I was a child and refused to eat what they gave me, either eat it or go to bed hungry, It worked. Don't feed her anything else unless she eats her meal. Why would she eat her ""veggies"" when she knows she can get some delicious chicken nuggets instead."
dogs,fdmm2cx,t3_em5wrm,1578555116.0,"Purina Pro Plan Focus has worked great for my dog, but I really don't think it is necessary to buy what could be for many expensive dog food. Pedigree has worked great for plenty of dog owners for years, and so have companies such as iams (This is not a very popular opinion among most here though). The main thing to look for is the aafco stamp."
