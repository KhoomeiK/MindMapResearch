deadmalls,ffcf3n7,t1_ffcctll,1579798099.0,"Yeah, I thought it was more too, but it's probably just because of media buzz."
deadmalls,ffc0jbt,t1_ffblvp4,1579788421.0,Deloitte did a study saying it's closer to like 9%
deadmalls,ffbb0nk,t1_ffawyqf,1579758039.0,Having studied a bit of management and the closing of retail stores I don't think malls are a dying breed. The closing of most recent retail stores in North America is partially attributable to a shrinking middle class. Splitting stores into a lower income or higher income audience with middle stores (which is a lot) just shutting down. Online stores are a very small portion of overall commerce still.

IAmA,fevh3no,t3_eqmcjh,1579397351.0,What's your opinion on maintenance? Should one come in for every maintenance the car indicates? Should one go to first or third party to save money? And in your experience are Mercedes from the last ten years reliable cars?
quotes,fepoge7,t3_eq68id,1579326068.0,Succinct and has a punch. I like it.
UofT,fenbkca,t1_felb7pt,1579281172.0,This is my gut feeling as well. I'll have to think of something. I'm going to also talk to a career and academic advisor seperately to get their take.
selfimprovement,fe83hdy,t1_fe7s6a8,1578922084.0,"I know, I'm the same type of guy. But depending on your goals what you do will still change. The best option for time saving is to hire a good trainer, even for a month, and you'll learn a lot. But if they're actually good it'll cost you."
selfimprovement,fe7qczc,t1_fe7i4qu,1578917930.0,"Well, it covers a lot, but I have heard some people say conflicting things on certain topics (calling them outdated, etc, but this kind of conflict is common in this industry). Also everyone has different goals, and depending on that your definitive guide will vary, and may not even exist.

I do highly recommend it because of the information on nutrition, for specific excersises you'll need to search depending on your goals."
KindVoice,fe7heio,t3_eo1x0e,1578914489.0,"Man. I have anxiety too so I know the angle you're coming from, though yours sounds worse than mine at this moment. It's a bad situation, because it sounds like it'll be painful if you quit and painful if you don't. 

One law in life is that often times we don't get to choose to not make a sacrifice, but only choose which sacrifice we make. I'm afraid you'll have to decide which option is better for you in the long run and push through for the good of your future self.

I also highly recommend this video

IWantToLearn,fe74dsz,t1_fe72mbf,1578909819.0,lol yeah that's no problem. But I think you'll be surprised how simple it is.
selfimprovement,fe72z2o,t3_eo0h14,1578909276.0,"That was how I got started with fitness actually. It's definitely a good foundation, coming from a guy who likes to do things correctly the first time and reading. I wouldn't pay too much attention to every single number but there are some good tips, eg how much protein to consume, when, etc."
ForeverAlone,fe71hsd,t1_fe612gt,1578908786.0,"I'm interested in stats, do you have a resource you could point me to?"
ForeverAlone,fe70aj4,t1_fe6uhhm,1578908358.0,"My sister met her boyfriend because his brother asked for her number for him. He saw her at the drive through window and said she looked cute. They've been together 3 years now. He was your age, also never dated.

I suppose you could always ask out the girl at the McDonald's drive through."
IWantToLearn,fe6yxmj,t1_fdz8yvx,1578907841.0,"I didn't know there was a written version, I thought it was just a tape. Either way, I listened to the first few chapters, I'm not sure the exact number. But until the end of how to develop a system for cards."

science,fdwidsq,t1_fdvzfkl,1578758952.0,"This reminds me of a dream I had, I walked into a cemetery looking for my grandmother's spot, and all the graves had been dug up and lay at floor level empty. An old man was sitting on a bench, and I asked him where everybody went. He said ""They've all gone home.""

One of two dreams that have ever made me cry."
BettermentBookClub,fdsftqc,t3_emw33w,1578701810.0,"Not exactly in the same vein but I got similar vibes from ""The 100 year old man who climbed out the window and disappeared"" and ""A Man Called Ove"""
Life,fdpxwzk,t3_elkb0r,1578645236.0,I feel the exact same about university friendships. I wonder if this is more common than I thought

I think a year off is an okay option if you do something  with it. But at the same time, you definitely  should decide what you want to do, and putting it off might not help you unless you use that time to make a better decision. I didn't want to go to school either,  I  reccomend  you tell people who ask you that's how you feel. That's what I did and I recieved  in return numerous  life stories that convinced me to stay in school."

Life,fdm5328,t3_em25bt,1578539996.0,"I've been on a similar painfully aware decline. But waking around 1 most days. Maybe you should get checked for depression, I've just done the same, indeed I have it. And I think that's the issue."
GetStudying,fdcf84v,t3_ekacas,1578273429.0,"I admire that a lot, I've got the same issues. It's incredibly difficult to study and I can't believe I even made it this far. I don't have it in me to stop for a second, because I know my parents won't support that and I definitely can't go at it alone. I guess I'll just take it slow here."
Life,fd69ogj,t3_ek5cap,1578187656.0,"I have wondered this myself. I would say it's not actually so black and white. You don't have to feel all things all the time, and you don't have to be numb to things all the time either. I think it's important for everyone to recognize the thoughts and actions that lead to escapism and determine if they're useful or destructive. There are times where it is useful to feel deeply because it indicates a problem in your life. There are times where feelings get in the way and once you overcome them you will become more capable of handling your problems.

Tl;Dr: You don't have to be numb or feel deeply all the time. Be aware of when each is useful by judging in the moment problem by problem, case by case."
suggestmeabook,fd5ykrf,t1_fd5syx9,1578183132.0,"I will definitely take a look, I've heard about it recently  as a tool designed by a guy with ADHD or something which I thought was interesting but forgot to take a look."
suggestmeabook,fd5y6a2,t1_fd5wn3w,1578182986.0,Oh should have mentioned I have read this. I followed the system for like 2 years but ran into a number of problems over that time and gave it up. Although some days I wonder if I should go back. Historically it's been too much work to upkeep
