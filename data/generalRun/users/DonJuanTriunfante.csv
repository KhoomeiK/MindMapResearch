StarWars,ff7tyak,t3_es1ce3,1579658294.0,"Fantastic theory, kinda chilling even. Microscopic correction though: bleeding a Kyber isn't a reaction of the crystal to its wielder, it's a process by which a darksider imposes their dark will on the crystal, in essence wounding it. We actually saw in a Darth Vader comic how Vader himself bled the crystal he carried for the next 23 years."
HobbyDrama,fess3wb,t3_eq9q67,1579368443.0,"I don't think Joker ""ruined"" anything. If anything, these ""critics"" and ""fans"" have done nothing but expose themselves for the pieces of garbage they are."

StarWars,fekrbv1,t3_epjjpr,1579205999.0,"My guess is ""balance"" meant in essence flipping the table and resetting the game, bringing both Jedi and Sith back to square one.

And for the naysayers saying Disney retconned this, I don't think it did. The prophecy never predicted everlasting peace. The Battle of Exegol permanently erradicated the Sith and now Rey can hopefully rebuild the Jedi by bringing them back to basics, back to their core ideals."

StarWars,fekpgjn,t3_epof7m,1579204889.0,"Ep7 Kylo Ren reminded me of Darth Revan, what with the hood and the robes and the mask, and that was awesome. Ep9 Kylo seemed to me as a sort of streamlined, faster Vader, which was also awesome."
AMA,fee5wy9,t3_eop97z,1579027058.0,What exactly makes you think you might have schizophrenia? Have you considered consulting with a psychiatrist to verify the diagnosis?
HobbyDrama,fe8pvny,t1_fe8p2w0,1578929115.0,"I kinda want to feel bad for them too, but then I remember the clips of people screaming about scams and wanting their money back, and that one guy cackling about how the $17k went to keeping the ballpit alive, and suddenly I can't feel that bad about it. I mean, you got all the signs that DashCon was going to fail, and yet the attendees not only tripped on the same rock repeatedly, they scoped and laser-targetted that shit and slammed face-first into it. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me."
HobbyDrama,fe8oh7z,t3_eo56jd,1578928613.0,"I remember the Internet Historian's video on this shitshow. The level of utter incompetence on behalf of the organizers was something legendary. It was essentially a massive, if slightly accidental, scam."

Also, I found the original Kevin story, linked it to my original comment in an edit. Now that you mention it, I would like you to read that story and give your professional considerations as an educator as to how you would have dealt with such an individual."
AMA,fe5u5py,t1_fe4q0fv,1578875010.0,"See the edit I made to my comment at the top, found the original post about Kevin. Welcome to Reddit, and I sincerely apologize for when you inevitably learn about the Swamps of Dagobah, the Jolly Rancher, EA's Pride and Accomplishment, and other epics."

Christian,fdsr9sd,t1_fdqis38,1578706916.0,"To add some additional context to this answer, I seem to recall that the date was chosen to tie into the winter solstice as sort of a way to ease pagans into the faith. I might be completely mistaken though, feel free to research more."
Christian,fdsqu0r,t3_emxr5o,1578706755.0,"Maybe I'm being disingenuous, but I think what really matters is being able to take it on the chin with dignity. For better or worse, not everyone will agree on which faith is correct, and only the Lord knows what truly lies in all our hearts. Might be interesting to know if this is one of the Satanists who only believes in sticking it to Christianity, or if he's the kind that believes in the pursuit of pleasure as long as you harm no one else; that would offer some additional context on if the Satanist in this story was being insulting or not."

Don't sweat it bro, it will come when it does. The big question is: if it does, will you be able to look at the Big Boss Upstairs in the eye with a clear conscience, no matter your sins, knowing you genuinely did your absolute best? If the answer is yes, then you've got your Apocalypse kit ready to go and nothing to worry about."

StarWarsCantina,fdqgr3k,t3_em6mie,1578666263.0,"Finn's arc was one of the best I've seen in a long while. He went from rogue stormtrooper, to self-serving coward, to facing fear, to near-suicidal madman, to self-sacrificing hero.
Ep7 he cares mostly about himself.
Ep8 he cares mostly about causing damage to the First Order.
Ep9 he balances both out and is willing to sacrifice himself in a surgically precise strike."

NoStupidQuestions,fczf1ou,t1_fczber6,1578099800.0,"Then how do you explain that it does so for a butt-ton of people? Are you implying that finding cis or trans people attractive is a choice, thereby categorizing a bunch of sexual preferences as a choice? Or is it a double standard?"

I loved all 9 Episodes, all the anthology films, all the series, everything, even the Holiday Special.
