fatlogic,ffu1ouc,t1_ffu1ikr,1580232583.0,This is good info as I'm still on the upper end of measurement with a 28 inch waist you basically saved me some googling!
fatlogic,ffqhuii,t1_ffqgsh7,1580135018.0,I can understand if they personally feel overweight but facts are facts. If they are of asian decent they could very  be overweight. But they're just avoiding answering the simple question of which formula they used.
fatlogic,ffpgc6s,t1_ffpfowd,1580094357.0,"My fitbit, doctor, the mayo clinic, cc website say other wise unless you're using a very specific formula. The only other one I've seen that measure that as overweight is one designed for asians. Which is why I asked which formula you were using.

fatlogic,ffosq8u,t1_ffoo50t,1580081241.0,"Which formula do you use because at 5'8"" that's high end bmi but not overweight for me."
Showerthoughts,ffosi7x,t1_ffore06,1580081137.0,Mothers beating you for having shoe prints on walls. Its house laws.
fatlogic,ffol0sp,t1_ffnn4un,1580078774.0,"Idk, depends on perspective. When you used to be a size 20 a size 10 is skinny. Or tall, a size 10 could be a healthy weight. If you were always lightweight then maybe a 10 is big too you, or your short so the weight shows more."
sex,ffoemap,t1_ffn28c1,1580076846.0,"Most of my experiences with trying to date women have led me to believe they only want dinner, and get mad if you try to split the bill. And sweat pants are acceptable wear to a first date. 
  
I have terrible luck with women so I stick with men."
Showerthoughts,ffodpo5,t1_ffobp2y,1580076642.0,"Floors are just walls you're allowed to put your feet on, my dude."
fatlogic,ffocjdm,t1_ffnuexo,1580076262.0,"And sizes vary greatly between companies. I just bought a romper in a L (that's still a bit tight) then went over one store and got a S shirt (that's stupid baggy). I currently wear a size 6, 8, and 10 in pants depending on the company. Nordstrom has the most consistent sizing but even then a fine dress (size 10) can fit fine while a skirt in 6/8 is baggy? Numbers are literally made up in fashion"
AskReddit,ffdjy2s,t1_ffcaj7y,1579822467.0,"Like grinding out potion leveling or farming resources in a game. Give me a pointless task and I'll do it for days. Gotta type up a report for work? I have the title started..
 I think."
fatlogic,ffajmzq,t1_ff9zkls,1579737378.0,That is very short and it makes sense now.
fatlogic,ff9p6a4,t1_ff8jgj8,1579717791.0,How... how... uhm...  how short are you that weighing less than 100lbs is healthy?
niceguys,ff9o7o3,t1_ff9n8fj,1579717118.0,It's true. Never heard another woman use it in a nice way. Always when they're talking down about someone.
PCOSloseit,ff5yx4x,t1_ff57paf,1579614696.0,You can but then I'll add one packet of splenda and the texture is there. Still tasty if you use vanilla or chocolate flavors.
PCOSloseit,ff5774b,t3_ern84j,1579582217.0,"When I lift I used quest protein. I use the powder like coffee creamer at this point. You brew your coffee into the shaker, add a scoop, add 4-8oz of milk, then shake. I'll add ice afterwards when I use only 4oz of milk and have a good breakfast/work snack ready to go. If you let it relax in the fridge for 30 mins, there is no chalky texture. A trick I picked up growing up on powdered milk."
BPD,ff3pu6h,t1_ff3ogfs,1579546264.0,"I don't lie. Every person is unique and the way BPD manifests is unique to the person. For me, I have issues with feeling abandoned and unloved. I also devote my life to my favorite person to the point of self neglect. I don't get angry or have violent outbursts. I dont manipulate others. I just can't control the intensity of my emotions. So ymmv with people who have BPD. There could also be other diagnoses as well. My mother had NPD, BPD, and was bipolar. She was a pathological liar. It honestly depends on the person, my dude."
BPD,ff3gvq5,t1_ff34oi0,1579540770.0,"I'm pretty sure my boyfriend would say different, but you won't change this belief you have."
BPD,ff3gov4,t1_ff33a8f,1579540662.0,No one can say but her. Or her therapist.
BPD,ff3059g,t3_erdnyt,1579530087.0,I've only ghosted the people who dumped or abused me. I'm apparently not your average BPD sufferer either based on this thread. I've only broken up with guys I know who were not good for me but as friends we were great. I still talk to one of them at least once a month and we keep each other at a comfortable distance. Maybe she needed more sexual compatibility while you two rocked at emotional compatibility. Maybe she was in a manic episode and is bouncing between high and lows. No one can answer for her except her so just ask her.
Showerthoughts,feor8am,t1_feoqxzt,1579304341.0,"Because I'm a sleep when he trots his big self into my bedroom, jumps up on the bed, lands on my face as he plops down. I can only shove him off so many times before he'll settle with using my hair as a bed. Cats are odd."
Showerthoughts,fenl5k3,t1_fenkymd,1579287030.0,"I feel like you should bring that up before sharing a bed. Just be all, ""Hey, I dont like physical contact when I sleep, so dont get upset if i push you away at night."""
Showerthoughts,fenkw8p,t1_fenixpf,1579286872.0,How big is your girlfriend's head? My boyfriend sleeps with his head on me all the time and it weighs less than my 15lb cat who sleeps on my face.
facepalm,fenel50,t1_fencyj4,1579283014.0,Oh wow. It's been 5 years for me. When will it come back? I dont want my hard work to be for nothing...
facepalm,fenehye,t1_fen28n8,1579282961.0,"Idk, I'm not good at this but; her hairline matches the same level of his sunglasses in both photos, the second one appears to be taken at a lower angle so her legs can appear longer. I totally don't abuse this angle for selfies... and her clothes are more flattering now instead of trying to hide her body so you get a better over all sense of proportion."
BPD,fenbpb2,t1_fen8hg5,1579281257.0,"No, but you wont be openly hated without people giving a chance to know you."
BPD,fenbl19,t1_fen4wg1,1579281183.0,"I know this sounds counter intuitive, but shower less. Every other day with dove sensitive soap has done wonders for my acne. I still get my boils during my ""period"" but my skin has calm down tremendously. That and using the yellow bottle of vaseline lotion instead of fragrant stuff for my legs. My back still gets them randomly but definitely not looking like chicken pox anymore."
BPD,fen4cm7,t1_fen3o46,1579276688.0,"I also have PCOS and was diagnosed at 16. I would often tell my foster parents I would go months without a period and when I did eventually get one, it was so bad I would change the super pads every 2 hours and guarantee to ruin my sheets at night. They thought I was exaggerating and complaining for attention. :D Same thing about a boil on my back that grew to a 3 inch shallow cess pool of infection that require minor surgery to clean out and had to get packed to heal it. All because of my BPD diagnosis I wasnt taken seriously. It's a curse. And because you're a woman any lower abdominal pain is ""period cramps"" when really its untreated cysts rupturing."
AskReddit,fen2mz2,t1_femv4hy,1579275603.0,"It would get knocked down in 3 minutes. People would purposely ram it. I've spent 10 years in retail. Customers are lazy, sadistic, and often times hilarious like this."
BPD,fen2ec9,t3_eq1mfd,1579275451.0,"It'll blow over in a few years when Hollywood moves on to the next mental illness. The only persons who knows about my illness is my roommate and my boyfriend. Everyone else in my life doesnt know and they just think I'm odd from my brain damage. I'm capable. I'm quirky. And the stigma of BPD will not follow me if I never share it. Unless you're on medication for it, dont even tell your doctors about it. It'll hinder your treatment plans as you get shoved into a ""they're being traumatic, its nothing"" mind set."
fatlogic,fekoxal,t1_fekkimb,1579204573.0,The short ones? That stop right under your under bust line. But a cardigan can totally pull it together as well!
fatlogic,fekj42a,t1_feka3rw,1579201113.0,The pink one looks adorable on you! Throw on a half sweater and you got a rockin' outfit!
fatlogic,fek7t8u,t1_fejyy8g,1579194407.0,"I buy mine a size larger than they need to be and then just tuck in the waist and adjust the top so my tits arent hanging out, but I've never had an issue with my ass hanging out at 5'8"". I also go for the rompers with skirts attached. I guess it also depends on the store brand you shop for because junior sized ones are really short in the body area while ""women"" sizes are usually more forgiving."
AskReddit,fejyvde,t3_epfjje,1579188971.0,"I had my wisdom teeth removed without proper pain meds. Novacain doesnt work right, like it relaxes my muscles but I still feel pain. They had to cut into my gum and break the teeth to remove them. I was screaming, crying, and 4 shots of novacain later I ended up throwing up from the pain. I was a literal mess by the time the dentist finished and spent the rest of the day crying off and on because they only prescribed me motrin for relief. To this day, I avoid the dentist until a tooth breaks and I have panic attacks leading up to the appointments."
fatlogic,fejydja,t1_fejttkf,1579188657.0,"Who ever wants to wear them. But its usually the thin build, almost athletic slim, bodies that look best in rompers. I wear them because they're comfy and cute and they're not flattering to my small chest/waist to huge hips/thighs but I still rock them. It's the confidence that makes it."
trashy,fdsfdw0,t1_fdr193f,1578701490.0,Apparently give my auto check the night off and called in my dyslexia.
personalfinance,fdqzvll,t1_fdqzkgv,1578677617.0,I accidentally closed my bathroom door to shower today and my cat literally yowled until I opened it up. He then proceeded to stare at me the entire time I was in the shower. No personal time allowed.
trashy,fdqzpih,t1_fdqvki0,1578677515.0,"Hey now, the trains arent that bad. Then again I only use them when I'm going to house of blues to avoid parking fees."
trashy,fdqzjye,t1_fdqtod9,1578677422.0,"The demographic for public transport users is a vast and wild one. They try to appeal to ""saving money"" and ""easy city transport"" but except in New York or the like no one but poor or people who make bad decisions uses it. I havent used the bus since I got a car because waiting an hour to get to work compared to a 15 min drive is a no brianer. Also, I get solicited less for weed, havent seen a crazy old man jack off, or been hit up for a dollar since. It's a culture of it's own."
