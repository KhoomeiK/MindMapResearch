(I’m excluding Nurie and Timothy from the family member count as they will (hopefully) never have to live with their psychotic family ever again!)"

FundieSnark,ffn7ml4,t3_eu85pv,1580062856.0,"I can’t stand Bethany or ANYTHING to do with Girl Defined, but I really don’t think this one it too bad. They might have invited their entire church (grifters gotta grift) and may not be on first name basis with every guest depending on the number of them.

(Ok, ok, I’m getting defensive. My mom wore two name tags at her baby shower. She wore one with her name on her chest like everyone else, but put a second on her shirt over the bump with the future baby’s name on it. It was my idea so I can’t properly snark on this one... My ma’s shower was REALLY low-key, though. 

(My mom and I helped run a center for newly arrive immigrants. [How they got here, why the came to America, and their legal status was never questioned. If they wanted to open up about it or need help going through the legal system, we’d always listen and do our best to assist, and anything they said about their immigration status was completely confidential.] I was still a kid at the time, so my job was to help the other children acclimate to a new country and language.

Another volunteer arranged a small party for her. 
(I know having a baby shower when you have already had children may seem tacky, but there was a 11 year gap between my sister and I, plus my mom was on her own this time so every bit of support possible was greatly appreciated!) 

One woman from South Korea baked an amazing cake, and though my mom specifically said “no gifts” we received something from every single woman, and even some men,  who utilized the program/shelter. Even a single pair of baby socks from a second hand shop made my mom burst into tears. There was so much love and support in that room. I had always been told “It’s the thought that counts!” but it wasn’t until that very day that I truly understood the meaning of those words.

I don’t think that will ever sink in for Bethany."
