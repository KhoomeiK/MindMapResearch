college,ff2tbl5,t3_er72ir,1579523292.0,University cannot guarantee a job for every single student. You know that. It's frustrating but it's up to us to figure the way out. You didn't get the internship because somehow others looked better than you.

Where I studied was a extreme hot weather country to the extent walking around some time during a day time makes your clothes soaked in sweat. I remember he just put those straight into wardrobe. He really shoudn't have done that."
college,feku71b,t1_fekozcv,1579207685.0,Oh I wrote like that. My bad. Yeah three days are totally fine indeed. What I meant was he was using his towel at least a week or even more. Which I wrote differently above. Not only towel but all his clothes laundry as well. He used to pile up his laundry in his wardrobe for a long amount of time so his wardrobe stinks. He also knew it's smelly and kept trying to let the wardrobe door open to ventilate into our room. And he was like 'don't be too sensitive.' to me.

unimelb,fekml54,t1_fdmg3s8,1579203182.0,good one
college,fekkfc1,t3_epjhi2,1579201902.0,"I had a similar roommate before. He did shower everyday but had a bad laundry habit. He didn't do his laundry often enough. It took him normally more than a week to do it. The most irritating thing was his big stupid towel which he always uses after shower. He basically brought one towel with him fgs. Since it's big he uses it at least a week. He just hang somewhere to dry it in our room (quite small room actually). After three days using it, our room smells like hell. I'd lived with him for about six months and I suffered from terrible headache and was gradually loosing my mind.

What I learned from this experience was getting a private room if you can afford. There's miserably slight chance to be matched with a roommate you'd like. It's nearly gamble to be honest. Moving in together with friend you already know is much better. Don't just simply apply for a university dorm without knowing who'd become your roommate. You might be loosing your mind to try saving some pennies which is obviously bigger loss."
