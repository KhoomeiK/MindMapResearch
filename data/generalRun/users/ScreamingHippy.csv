Braincels was the last place on reddit men could congregate together over a common issue without the interference of women.

Venting is merely a matter of pouring out everything on your mind - hate may be a by-product of that.

>Why do people always get this wrong? ""Free speech"" is about the government, not private corporations like Reddit.

Reddit was founded in San Franciso, America (I think), thus they'll act under the American laws.
That is precisely why everyone has a heart attack on reddit if they see a 20 year old dating a 17 year old, because in **California - San Francisco**, the age of consent is 18.

Publish the same story on a UK medium and nobody would bat an eye.

OP, serious question. Have you seen pictures of half of the posters who regularly post in this sub?

I have seen more fakecels in this sub and r/Braincels than I have seen on Incels.co (Yes I'm already on there ---> Username: Hate_my_life).

The reason I like Incels.co is there's no censorship and no women. If I'm annoyed at the way a woman reacted to me, or acted towards me: I can vent on that sub (within legal boundaries) and I won't be met with a barrage of whiteknights calling me ""Hateful"" or be met by the infamous ~~whalegaming~~ quoting a rule and deleting my post.

>This place is not about the black pill or inceldom, it's about power, control and politics.

There has been more blackpilled posts, posted on Incels.co than I have seen here.

I was going to post so many blackpill related memes, but as there's **A WOMAN** in charge (that wouldn't even slide on .co), she'll delete them for ""HaTeFuL cOnTeNt"".

>The mods in charge have a monopoly over the incelsphere and are corrupt with power.

I do agree with this point. 

>The reason I put incels in quotation marks is because the staff are most likely not even incels themselves

There's literally a woman moderating this sub and she was previously engaged.
Furthermore she's a regular on muh TruFemcels...


The fact that this is r/IncelswithoutHate (emphasis on the **Hate**)means Incels are being castrated from voicing what they truly want to say. I don't even know if you're allowed to refer to women by the other term starting with F and that rhymes with droid.



>Apparently, you need to prove how incel you are before you're worthy of joining this fake cult (like anyone wants to be incel), while subhuman trash like this gets to run the show.

I do agree with this.
Everyone wants to ""one-up"" the other in terms of how genetically unfavourable they are.

>Then when you do have a rare member who actually values themselves and develops a unique personality, they get punished for it. A notable, recent example of this was the user Galleo, who stood out too much for his own good. He might have lasted longer had he called himself The Ugly One instead of The Beautiful One.

If you regard Galleo as having a good personality,  then the bar which you set for one having a

He was an annoying spammer that posted the same shit over and over again (quite literally), over and over again.

**(Note: If you have an external Hard drive available, it would be quicker to move contents from your hard drive to the External hard drive (I'll expand on why later)**

Shut down PC.
Ground yourself.
Open your PC.
Disconnect all Drives.
Plug in ssd.
Plug in bootable drive.

Enter BIOS for your PC.
Boot from the USB.
Follow process to install windows (partitions are up to you - not recommended for most cases).
Once windows has installed on ssd, shut down your pc.

Plug in all drives.

Boot up.

Change BIOS to boot from ssd.

*Now remember when I said move contents to an external hard drive? I didn't do that on my laptop and for some reason Windows has a weird safety feature that prevented me from accessing my hard drive.

No it isn't.

You're looking at things through the lens of a woman where there issues are all in their head.

Take Inceldom for example, we've been given the worst hands possible at birth. As a result, we're genetically undesirable. You can't talk an Incel into becoming Chad.

Talking doesn't help men at all, because our issues are serious: nevertheless, we should just ""Man up"".

>Don't dismiss something for an entire gender just because you personally don't like it.

Maybe women, they can ""talk"" out their issues, but for most men, they genuinely have a serious problem, which is why we commit suicide in greater numbers.

There is no way to ""talk"" to the solution in my case, thus I'm just speeding up my time to death.

Depends how you debunk them.

If you resort to using: ""I kNoW a gUy"", then I'm probably gonna repeatedly slam my head against a wall.

If you debunk a large majority of studies and any counterpoint I'll provide (Tinder experiments/Other studies) and take into account that I've done every possible self-improvement any man can do. Then I may take into account your advice.
