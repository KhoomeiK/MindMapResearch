FortniteCompetitive,fgn76n2,t1_fgn0vzx,1580938990.0,It really is a great option to put it on the sticks. Especially if you use always sprint and dont use auto run. Freeing up LS  and RS to remap.
FortniteCompetitive,fgn6vkl,t3_ezg32h,1580938827.0,"Like RS as in Right stick for controller? If so, I use it and it makes my edits way quicker than any other button I have tried. I also have it set to reset and L2 as confirm. So I double press to reset a wall or cone. Its just as useful on LS too. Just depends on which you prefer. I could see it being an issue if you are aiming close to your wall and you accidentally press the stick or if you have a heavy thumb. But other than that Try it out and just see how you like it."
aww,fgjq5aa,t1_fgj7669,1580849202.0,Itll be no worries.

FortniteCompetitive,fggde3m,t1_fggcyqv,1580759515.0,You can. Or could. At this time I havent used it on pc in a few weeks. I'll see uf I can get you a link to the video.
FortniteCompetitive,fgg1ztp,t1_fgfnw8n,1580752509.0,Dominator FPS strike pack. Best 40 Ive spent.
news,ffntk50,t1_ffnoezc,1580070621.0,It comes in 3s man.
projectsession,ffgblqb,t1_ffg580j,1579902648.0,Awesome. I'll check this out over the weekend.
projectsession,ffg515r,t3_etchpc,1579898603.0,"Question, With customizing the player model, are there good resources one can find to help? The only things I have found for modding have been Map related. And I really want my skater to look like a skater. LOL. The in game stuff has been fine, but I  want moar ya know."
projectsession,ff76lsa,t3_erx4rn,1579642139.0,I dont think so personally. While it is constant and less prone to jittering. It doesnt capture the dynamic action a well animated replay camera can. But the Replay system is still quite buggy.
projectsession,ff3dh45,t3_eqjlkb,1579538913.0,GGs dude.
projectsession,ff39l70,t1_feymbim,1579536901.0,Its glitchy as hell. Lol but It is  fun once you figure out how to use it.
Plunderer,fejuvo5,t1_fejh5av,1579186394.0,I just reread the manga and I read a chapter where they start using Aces. I guess I forgot that.
Plunderer,fedz382,t1_fdzeqxu,1579022923.0,I have an issue with the dialog. I like the translations I read more. They arent Aces. They are Legendary Barrons. And when they wager their Stars it is Called a Star theft bout in the manga. But not the Anime. Visually it is practically straight from the Pages. Im going to keep watching it cause I want it to succeed.
fanart,fedrbqk,t3_eolzxz,1579018218.0,You get what you deserve. Heres my upvote!
funny,fedqca2,t1_fedntmt,1579017597.0,Dude Kennan was definitely on my list. From All that to SNL he really does a good job lol.
sololeveling,fedq894,t1_fedffq8,1579017526.0,I wasnt a fan. The art was so off putting to me. In a way it reminds me of One Piece. Where theres this incredible story but the art just doesnt captivate me in a way where I want to watch it. In this case it was reading. I wanted to like it too cause theres a ton of chapters.
FFVIIRemake,fedo88x,t3_eolnue,1579016268.0,I wonder what needed polishing at the last possible second. lol. Feels bad man.
funny,fedmy2u,t1_fed44qr,1579015443.0,If it came back who would you cast?
anime,fecp8le,t3_elvkee,1578979768.0,Well artistically id say its accurate. But the dialog in japanese and English differ from what ive read.  Or the translation I read is wrong.
anime,fdrglrp,t1_fdqxk3p,1578684204.0,Thats so unfortunate. I wonder how many amazing animes never actually get released. From what I have read this is a 10 year old anime and ive just heard about it from this post.

anime,fdqrxi9,t1_fdqh7tz,1578673582.0,Is this on any streaming platforms?
aww,fdqqx3z,t1_fdqc5tk,1578672964.0,Correct. Guy proposing is the animator.
conceptart,fdqpk6p,t3_emoa2y,1578672117.0,1 & 3 are dope. Not quite sure about 2 with the hanging piece. Maybe move that to her waist in the front to give more symmetry to the cloth on her backside? Awesome sketches dude.
FL_Studio,fdqp7nb,t3_emplff,1578671898.0,"Im not a beat maker but as someone who works in Photoshop and After effects, Layer management in any program usually results in time saved, And time saved = money \[and sanity\]. Because if you get deep into a project and have to change something. Knowing where everything is at means you can make edits quicker than scouring through a hot mess."
