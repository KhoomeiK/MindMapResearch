I get it's not the same as your job but I was an Ironworker for a few years and had an absolute miserable time with it. I enjoyed the work - when we had any in the area. If you don't, you might get lucky and boom out to another unions area to help out. If not, enjoy unemployment.

My last year in I made 11k from January to October. Then when someone very close to me almost lost their leg and I needed to take care of them - it was ""you can be an Ironworker or a fucking nurse maid, not both"".

So I walked. I now weld in an ""employee owned"" shop. While the employee owned thing is a bit of a joke, they actually take care of you and pay a pretty penny. In my year and a half of working there I've climbed out of poverty, have almost 5 figures in the bank, and am on the cusp of buying a home for the first time - at 34.

I'm a dude and got one out on a girl years ago after she threatened to vandalize my vehicle and break into my house. I literally showed the judge the text messages and he approved an order of protection for, I think, 9 weeks. A county deputy served her with the papers, which included a clause saying ""no guns in the house"" - since she lived with her parents, her dad had to take his guns to a friend's house for those 9 weeks.

During a hard custody battle I lived with my mom for a bit and noticed her memory was fading quickly. Moved in with my girlfriend, we split up, and I went back to mom's briefly before moving an hour away. Now it is obvious that my mom is in the early stages of something and we are getting her to go to the doctor. 

Guess who all my siblings have unanimously decided is going to move home and care for my mom? That's right, the guy they mocked for taking care of our father while he was dying.
