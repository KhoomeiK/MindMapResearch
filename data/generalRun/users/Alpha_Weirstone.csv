AmItheAsshole,fff8oen,t1_fff0wmi,1579878474.0,"I think you wildly misunderstand my point. And what I'm saying. I'm not equating the systemic racism in the US  with fetishism. I'm referring to response to it, I want to convey a much deeper point, not the right wing ""oh racism exists because minorities perpetuate it and dont know their place!"" Bullshit. 

My point about Americans treating things as ""White"" and ""non-white"" is that they simplify racism. To a degree that is concerning, because racism should never be treated as something that only one group of people perpetuate. The irony in that would be astounding."
AmItheAsshole,ffez5lh,t1_ffdl1e2,1579871046.0,"Because Americans in general seem to see the rest of the world as either ""White"" or ""Not White"" ? I was thinking about a response but honestly I'm too tired to try and explain everything weird about American culture."

pureasoiaf,fez18ex,t1_fez0dbs,1579452967.0,"I mean, this is true. But ""romance"" in fiction takes on a more personal role for the reader, there's a sense of viscerality and so on when there's war in fiction. Shock, horror and tension at murder, rape and corruption. Those kinds of relationships are important in a dramatic sense and there's nothing wrong with liking those kinds of stories, but when your reason for liking it is that you like the pairing, then it can be said to reflect on what they like in real life."

Reminds me a bit of anime characters in general sometimes, or just some characters in fiction, where they're developed poorly and have a generally superficial reaction to some things.
