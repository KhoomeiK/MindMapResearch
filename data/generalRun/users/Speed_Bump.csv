nba,ffum3ym,t3_evai3v,1580244854.0,"I don't care about finals records. Baylor's best scoring years coincided with Wilt's best scoring years so he never won a scoring title. His best team years coincided with Russell's Celtics run and the Lakers did not have a good center to counteract Bill but Baylor for several years was still putting up 30+/13 in those series. 

I only caught the last few years of his career when injuries were taking their toll but he should have won a title in 69 but the coach fucked up and,let his hate for Wilt get in the way the last few minutes.He is the guy that lead to Dr. J. and eventually Jordan by being the player who made hang time and playing in the air a thing.

His time as an coach and an exec were not good but he is one of the greats when it comes to players."
