conspiracy,ffs51ig,t1_ffs2hg3,1580173312.0,"The precedent isn't about the admin, it's for the courts. How was that unclear? The Admin has the right to dispute a legislative subpoena regardless of precedent (though precedent also supports this). Once the admin disputes a call for a witness it is out of the admin's hands and into the hands of the court. The precedent in the case of an impeachment is that the Courts will fastrack any such cases and rule on it quickly and efficiently. If the admin decided to ignore a court-supported subpoena it would allow the House to incontrovertibly charge the admin with Obstruction of Justice.  
  
I've specifically been talking in general terms to try to avoid the politically charged nature of this, though apparently that hasn't worked because all you have done here is accused me of unjustly defending Trump specifically. Everything I've said applies to any administration. This is how our government works regardless of who is currently in the Oval Office."
conspiracy,ffs1myt,t1_ffs0ljg,1580170938.0,"So you are ignoring the previous precedent we have where these cases are handled quickly and efficiently and substituting your own imagined precedent? If it is self-evident as you have claimed the SC would handle it very quickly as they have in the past. Why did the house avoid such a court case for such a self-evident outcome?   
  
I dispute your claim that this is self-evident based on this outcome. The House had no reason to avoid such a case as, if it were self-evident as you claimed, it would have been a quick victory in the courts based on previous precedent. You have offered nothing to support your claim that this would be handled differently than the precedent we have available.  
  
So we have a few options here. Either the House does not think their case is as self-evident as you do, the House randomly decided to forgo an easy victory given the precedent we have available, our courts, which are based on precedent, would randomly decide to forgo precedent, or the House thought it was of paramount importance to push this through as quickly as possible and then decided to sit on the articles. The only one that does not involve a logical leap or the House/Courts acting completely irrationally/out of precedent is that they (the House) don't think the case was as self-evident as you claim."

And how exactly is the Trump admin arguing their case in court acting in bad faith? That's the point of bringing it to court. The admin thinks it doesn't have to supply the witnesses, the House disagrees. Each side argues their position and the Judges decide. That's how court works...
  
Further, it's pretty routine for Administrations to claim executive privilege when the House subpoenas their members. Trump is far from the first president to do this. If an admin (any admin) has a partisan investigation being launched against them, how is it in the administration's interest to comply with all requests from said partisan investigation? Obama refused to comply with partisan investigations against him through executive privilege as have many other presidents."

If no reasonable person would have disputed the witnesses the House called, it would have been a quick and clean case in the courts. After the case, any refusal by the administration would be Obstruction of Justice and grounds for removal. What is your opinion as to why the House decided to forgo this easy victory (from your perspective) and rush through the articles?"
conspiracy,ffrnl7n,t1_ffrm5cr,1580161765.0,"Partially correct, the house does not have the right to rule on executive privilege. If the admin disputes a call on a member of the admin they have the right to a court ruling. We have checks and balances so that no one branch has absolute power over another branch. However, it should be noted that the administration can only dispute calls on members of the administration.   
  
This is a result of the separation of powers between the branches, the legislature does not have the authority to resolve a dispute between the legislature and the executive (nor should they).
  
In previous impeachments these rulings have been handled quickly and in bulk. The courts were able to effectively and efficiently rule on witnesses called whenever an administration disputed a call. The house could have followed the same precedent here and it would have been handled as quickly and efficiently as before as precedent has been set.

The cart can be effectively held for a long while at the gate by an effective defender team. I've seen games won by defenders here and I've seen long holds here that allows defenders to win at a later stage.   
  
The ""turning the trebuchet"" stage is probably the only one that might be a bit defender biased. If the defense focuses on staying inside the white circle on the right trebuchet (from defense perspective), it can be very hard for the attackers to push them out. Many players don't know this I think, but the attackers have to push every single defender out of the circle to progress the objective. The problem is the sweaty players tend to stack the easier team (mountain peak has the same issue) so it's fairly rare I can convince a sizable chunk of the defense to just focus on staying alive in the circle."

I don't know what the ruling would have been in a Supreme Court case in this specific case, the House decided they wanted to rush through their articles without the witnesses they wanted instead of waiting for the courts to rule as procedure requires.  
  
Following our judicial process and allowing the president their right to demand a court ruling is obstruction? How do you think this works? The house just gets absolute power over the executive by being granted the ability to resolve disputes between the House and Executive? Does this apply for every admin or only ones you don't like?

None of what you quoted even vaguely insinuates that the house has the authority to rule on whether or not their subpoena is justified. If the house wanted those witnesses, and it is as much of a shoo-in as you claim, the house should have had no issues whatsoever following the proper procedures for compelling witnesses from the administration. It makes one wonder why the house decided to rush through and then sit on the articles. The precedent was set during previous impeachments for the SC to fastrack any cases related to the impeachment. The house would have only needed one ruling, and if the admin had refused to comply after then they could have charged Trump with Obstruction of Justice (which actually exists).

This lab is China's first with level 4 safety. China (government), and many Chinese people, have a very different view on safety standards than people in western nations. It could have been accidentally released due to an employee failing to decontaminate properly or failing to properly dispose of contaminated materials. One of the more plausible theories I've read (no direct evidence) is that it's possible a low level employee tasked with destroying contaminated animal corpses decided to make a profit and sell the corpses to the nearby meat market instead.  
  
An accidental release of something being developed as a bioweapon would certainly explain China's response so far. Typically their government likes to act like nothing is wrong within their borders, but they're instating massive quarantines and openly stating how bad this is (though their numbers are likely still underreported).

The house does not have the ability to rule on claims of executive privilege. That belongs to the judicial branch. We have a system of checks and balances.  
  
When an admin (any admin) refuses to comply with an order from the legislative branch by claiming executive privilege, it is then up to the courts to decide whether or not that claim is justified. Not the legislature. The house decided they did not want to wait on the courts because, as the narrative at the time claimed, it was imperative to resolve the impeachment as quickly as possible. Though, the house sitting on the articles as long as they could makes me doubt that and further leads me to believe it was a blatantly partisan operation.  
  
I'm not ""giving"" any admin increased power. Admins have always been able to claim executive privilege, and based on previous precedent I believe the court would have ruled on the side of the admin for this case.  
  
This is why ""Obstruction of Congress"" is absurd. It's saying that the basic method by which our government operates is ""Obstruction of Congress.""
