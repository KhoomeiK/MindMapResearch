The job was just very low level Power Point, no advanced IT or design skills needed. The job was also very easy with a lovely and relaxed work environment. I asked the manager why they were paying so much for a gig that would typically pay half of what he was paying. He answered that the material being produced was important for his business and he did not expect anyone to care about a $12/hr job. He said it wouldn't be reasonable to pay anyone $12 and think they'd bother showing up on time or paying attention to detail. However he knew if you paid an admin temp $25/hr they're going to care *a lot* about that job and likely show up early, not take extended breaks, and work their ass off to make sure they're called next time that customer needs a temp."

It's possible she herself was a narc, or it's possible he's lying. If you remove the narc aspect, it's sad but not unremarkable that you love someone that doesn't love you back.

But eventually the booze poisoned me to where continuing wasn't an option. With narc he'd poisoned my heart to where anything but NC wasn't an option. I guess in a way the cumulative years are what help because I have so much terrible treatment to remember. Probably the lowest was that he lied about being in a relationship when we met. After three years of NC he drove across three states to ""apologize"" and tell me he loved me and had asked his wife for a separation.

If someone is a narcissist due to childhood trauma, turning to animals makes sense. A lot of broken people love animals because they're so pure and never cause gratuitous pain. I'm an ethical vegan and you'll find a lot of very very hurt individuals doing rescue because they identify with the abused and tortured animals."
NarcissisticAbuse,ff8uh39,t3_esaynt,1579696500.0,"You're not connected on a deep level. That's just a feeling he creates. If you're connected on a deep level why doesn't he travel to see you? Does he text or call to ask how your day went? Does he send you flowers? What *actions* does he take to show you how important you are to him. Never ever ever pay attention to what a man says, only to what he does. I was caught up with one for years even after I was totally aware of what he was; my go-to explanation was that I continued to see him for the same reason heroin addicts continue to stick needles into their arms. I finally got away. 

I'll give you a spoiler alert. Breaking away doesn't feel good. It feels like nothing. It's not even a breakup because the narcissist had no emotional engagement with you to begin with. You're deprived of the intense high but alleviated of the stress and trauma, but it was stress and trauma you shouldn't have had in the first place."

Things aren't perfect but we love each other. We're meant to be together. He wouldn't say he loved me if he didn't. I'm going to work EVEN HARDER to make this work.""

He looked and acted normal. He's successful and well regarded in his career. You try and make sense of behavior that flat out doesn't make sense. They're not wearing tin foil hats or believing that the air conditioner is speaking to them. The first time they do something mean you assume they don't like you. I thought this the first time I was stood up on a date. I was sad and depressed and all like ""oh damn. I really liked him and thought he liked me. Oh well, I'm hurt but obviously that happens...."" Then he called me. I was like...""why are you calling? You stood me up so obviously you're not interested."" He told me I was wrong, that we'd never had ""firm plans"". I said we did and literally articulated what they were. He then sternly said ""the back and forth needs to stop. Either we move forward or not.""

If an individual is gaining or losing weight outside of what's normal, there's a good chance it's health related. Maybe you're eating [or not] due to depression.

When you explain why you're hurt *they don't care* because they don't care about hurting you. Your soul is collateral damage. They'll also attack you for dwelling on their misdeeds or demanding an explanation. They'll insist your problems stem from your inability to forgive/move on/""get past it""."

Men and women both can be jerks. Narcissists however are entirely different. Their behavior around you isn't unique.
