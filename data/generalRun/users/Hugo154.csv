YouShouldKnow,ffi4ijd,t1_ffhzzx3,1579964850.0,"“I have bad anxiety and I’ve heard that thyroid issues can be one reason for mental illnesses like that and depression. Can you check my hormone levels to make sure?”

It’s very common for people to have their thyroid checked, so it shouldn’t be a problem at all. You’ll have to get your blood drawn, which they’ll either do at the same visit and send it off or give you a referral to go to a lab for, and then your doctor will call you back a few days later with the results and explain them to you. Insurance should cover the test if you have it; without insurance it’ll be anywhere from $10-100 depending on the lab your doctor works with (plus the cost of the doctor’s appointment and possibly an additional cost for the blood draw itself.) You *can* go and get a blood level yourself I think, but it’s really not useful unless you have a doctor to interpret the results and actually do something about it if there is something wrong.

That said, have you seen a psychiatrist about your anxiety? Because that would be the best thing to do imo. A psychiatrist would be even more likely than a primary care doc to refer you to a lab to get your hormones checked, they‘ll be better at interpreting the results in relation to your specific mental illness, and they’ll have a better idea of what to do about it. I know that psychiatrists are expensive and can have long waits to get an appointment though, so I understand if you‘d be apprehensive about doing that."

> if people can't make even a small effort to try to research what they're buying and whether it's effective, then it's completely fine for companies to exploit them.

I very much disagree with this, and I don't think most people understand the harm that these companies do. First of all, I think you underestimate the extent of the marketing and manipulation that goes into this shit. A lot of these companies prey on sick people who are either at the end of their rope or can't afford actual medical care because of our fucked up healthcare system.

Second of all, all of these companies sow distrust in actual doctors by promoting their ""alternative medicine,"" which is just a stepping-stone to awful, toxic beliefs that affect us all, like the anti-vaxx movement. 

Lastly but most importantly imo, some of the supplements aren't just neutral, they do actually have effects and can interfere with actual medication, but it's all so unregulated that it's impossible to know exactly what you're getting so doctors can't work with it at all, they have to just hope their patients listen to them when they tell them not to take them. On top of this, patients very often fail to tell their doctors about what supplements they're taking at all, which can cause major issues. The most famous example of this is St John's Wort, which interacts with tons of meds (such as immunosuppressants, heart medications, chemotherapy drugs, birth control, and warfarin) and can even cause serotonin syndrome if it's taken with SSRIs."
