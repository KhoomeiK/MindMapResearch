Being an EMT can take literally less than 30 days and cost under $2k. It’s more of a course and not a “school”. It’s very low risk compared to many other options. 

also, EMT training is not a compromise, it’s the END of the spectrum. Nursing school may be a compromise instead of Med School, but EMT is not a compromise. 

There’s few trainings shorter than an EMT course. Talking about EMT versus nursing is like talking about buying a McDonald hamburger versus making your own slow roast BBQ: Both have their fans. Both are fine, but one is much faster. 

I think you should try to get some exposure to health care if you don’t have it already, and see how you feel about it. If you are hesitant about EMT, my sense is that You haven’t really seen a lot of healthcare. 

Emt is 100% a stepping stone to other positions, but can be tougher s as a stand alone career. Look at the PA career track, flight paramedic, flight nursing, NP, and so forth. 

Once you finish your EMT course, you typically take a state level practical skills test and a national test called the NREMT

Most people pass these. Keep reading and researching! Remember that good things in life often require investment and sacrifice. Try to get exposure to healthcare by shadowing and observing in multiple environments."

**Your Roth IRA contributions (what you put IN)  can be ALWAYS withdrawn without a penalty, for ANY PURPOSE.** 

&#x200B;

So if you want to buy a house with the $ you put into a Roth, you can take the same dollar value OUT as you put in.  


This is a huge detail that really, really matters.

Of course, I don't recommend that you tap a Roth IRA for anything except emergencies and high priority purchases (home downpayment, legitimately good education are basically it).

Most people think that IRAs are basically a one-way transaction, but **Roth IRAs are much more flexible.**

Young people, remember: with a Roth IRA, your contributions are NOT gone for the next 50+ years.

  
Bonus sidenote: you can often tap a regular IRA for the purposes of buying a home if you are a ""first time home buyer"".  Note that the IRS has rules about what is a ""first time home buyer"", and it's not as straightforward as what you might think.

Fun side note: there are other flexible retirement account structures, so do your research and confirm facts from multiple sources. For example, a Solo 401k plan (tax-deferred, like a traditional IRA) will often allow you to take **loans from your retirement savings that you have to pay back, with interest...to YOURSELF**.
