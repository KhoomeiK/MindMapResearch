I fear we're entering a recession soon and will need the green new deal to pull us out. QE won't be available because trump is keeping rates low so a job guarantee program will work. Put people to work rebuilding the roads, bridges and energy. New renewable farms. M4A to help keep people healthy. A new voting rights act to right the Gerrymandering wrongs, with automatic registration. Ending the wars and bringing our troops home. Ending ICE and the TSA. Let the CBP protect the border and airport security handle itself. Create national police standards and a database to track abuse. Go on a campaign of contrition and apologize to the whole world for the decades of war crimes committed in the name of greed."

As far as M4A is concerned every other industrialized nation figured it out decades ago and they're better for the average person across the board.

politics,ff9zzqp,t1_ff9ftcl,1579725112.0,"Because most Congress critters are guilty of the same thing. They can't expose him without exposing themselves. They vote the way the corporations want then get kickbacks either from insider trading, gifts, cushy jobs after leaving office, or get paid 200k for a 1 hr. speech."
thedavidpakmanshow,ff9xvfa,t1_ff9f37n,1579723867.0,No because people support trump because of feels and they support bernie on policy.
PoliticalHumor,ff9d83i,t1_ff8y3mj,1579710433.0,What? When the media's not ignoring Bernie they're smearing him. That's damn near all that ever brought up. The closest thing I can think of to praise I've seen from mainstream media is when that one fox news show said he wasn't a sexist.

politics,ff7neg9,t1_ff79i07,1579653714.0,You realize that bubble will burst right? The whole quantitative easing is just a fancy word for printing money and it's something you're supposed to do to help ease a recession and do the opposite in a strong economy.
politics,ff7n8qz,t1_ff7a9bf,1579653602.0,We're in the midst of a bubble and that part of the reason for the trillion dollar deficit. It can't last. Also border crossing were at a near 50 year low when he took office.

It also may have been originally a lion that pointed towards the constellation leo during that time but was carved down later for a king.

politics,ff4ik9z,t1_ff49n24,1579564466.0,"Yes, but bill flew with him 26 times and Hillary several as well. Bringing up dirty laundry by corrupt Democrats allowed trump to make everything a wash with regard to his own corruption. It could have been any number of powerful and influential people and it would be easier to do then you would think. He was the king pedo so there would be no shortage of people willing to help. Threaten a man's family, give him some money and get parole for a convict or relocate them to a better prison. Feel generous and donate to get a pardon like people did with matt bevin of ky. Hell Epstein cellmate was a dirty cop and giant so you know you can bribe him."

politics,ff3hlax,t1_ff3gz56,1579541199.0,Well 3/4 of the electorate were white so if a percentage of the electorate said fuck it then naturally that's most likely to be mostly white.
politics,ff3fdsw,t1_ff3bmfw,1579539932.0,"Yes better than trump, but he still bombed thousands of innocent people in at least 7 countries, didn't punish bankers for financial crisis, didn't charge previous administration with war crimes, didn't push single payer through, lost a 1000 seats across the country, helped most of what was recovered after recession go to the top. Nothing fundamentally changed. Same as Hillary would have been or Biden will if he's elected. Healthcare was still massively more expensive than anywhere, 30-45000 still died due to lack of care. 500,000 still declared bankruptcy due to medical debt. Most lived paycheck to paycheck, would have trouble covering a $500 emergency. 50% still made 30k or less. Households still averaged 53k a year. Sure people are racist assholes and that helped elect trump, but enough people said fuck it and rolled the dice."

politics,fetlphi,t1_fesueam,1579376681.0,Yes. It's bullshit. The internet has been around for decades and EVERY politician's dirty laundry is out there for anyone to see and what 75 80% of the electorate can't be bothered to spend even an hour looking up the people that control a large part of their life that they themselves have a small part in controlling.
