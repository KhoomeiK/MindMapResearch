So, the propeller was designed to go off when the noise did, and you could only stop the noise by picking it up from wherever it spun down to and clicking it back into the base.


Three problems.


One,  my ceiling was angled because I was in the attic, and the room was roughly the size of a broom closet, so the propeller would whing up into the ceiling and go *somewhere.*


Two, the propeller was cheap, and didn't really come with any real instructions, so I had a hell of a time getting the propeller back on the base every morning. It was supposed to be square peg/square hole, but it was more like square peg/round peg.

And three, possibly the worse part, is that *I couldn't set the damn timer.* And I swear to god it would change when it went off, but it was normally either a part of my day at three am, five pm, or both."

But at eight o'clock Christmas eve, I got a horrible UTI for the first time in my life, so I was lying on my parents' downstairs bathroom floor feeling like I was gonna die for five hours until I finally passed out for a couple of hours. I wake up Christmas morning and I don't feel like I'm gonna die anymore but still awful, so we all swiftly open our presents from each other, and I realise I can't go to see my grandparents. I can't even be away from a bathroom long enough to go back into the city and be with my cats. So my family leaves and I'm left alone in my childhood home (I'm twenty) on Christmas, watching YouTube videos and cleaning up wrapping paper. My older brother's girlfriend had actually called me a couple hours into that miserable day to offer to join her at her family Christmas Dinner, but the whole point was to not be in a car, so I thanked her much and refused. She said ""okay, but call me and let me know if you need anything, I'm not far away.""

Christmas was still ruined for me but she did do something wonderful, though: it was about six or seven o'clock and I hear knocking on the door, and I assume it's my neighbour come to crack vegan jokes at me, or UPS or something, so I ignore it. But then I get a call from my brother's girlfriend saying she's standing outside. I quickly let her in and she walks in with her and my brother's pet dog and a *full* plate of Christmas dinner, complete with a ziploc bag of dinner rolls. The dog lies at her feet and sleeps as the two of us chatter about everything and nothing until we both realise it's ten pm, and she should get going and I should take my medication. It might be one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me."

memes,fdxf1s4,t3_en8qf5,1578768115.0,"I used to have an alarm clock in middle school forced upon me that would go off with an awful whinging noise and this helicopter propeller would *thwap* off the top and go sailing into my room. So, the propeller was designed to go off when the noise did, and you could only stop the noise by picking it up from wherever it spun down to and clicking it back into the base.


Three problems.


One,  my ceiling was angled because I was in the attic, and the room was roughly the size of a broom closet, so the propeller would whing up into the ceiling and go *somewhere.*


Two, the propeller was cheap, and didn't really come with any real instructions, so I had a hell of a time getting the propeller back on the base every morning. It was supposed to be square peg/square hole, but it was more like square peg/round peg.

And three, possibly the worse part, is that *I couldn't set the damn timer.* And I swear to god it would change when it went off, but it was normally either a part of my day at three am, five pm, or both."

AskReddit,fc2zhlm,t3_efqzp6,1577378011.0,"I bought two automatic cat feeders so I could come home for three measly days to my childhood home, and we would all visit both grandparents' houses (it's important to see them whenever we can because one of my grandmas is 98....). But at eight o'clock Christmas eve, I got a horrible UTI for the first time in my life, so I was lying on my parents' downstairs bathroom floor feeling like I was gonna die for five hours until I finally passed out for a couple of hours. I wake up Christmas morning and I don't feel like I'm gonna die anymore but still awful, so we all swiftly open our presents from each other, and I realise I can't go to see my grandparents. I can't even be away from a bathroom long enough to go back into the city and be with my cats. So my family leaves and I'm left alone in my childhood home (I'm twenty) on Christmas, watching YouTube videos and cleaning up wrapping paper. My older brother's girlfriend had actually called me a couple hours into that miserable day to offer to join her at her family Christmas Dinner, but the whole point was to not be in a car, so I thanked her much and refused. She said ""okay, but call me and let me know if you need anything, I'm not far away.""

Christmas was still ruined for me but she did do something wonderful, though: it was about six or seven o'clock and I hear knocking on the door, and I assume it's my neighbour come to crack vegan jokes at me, or UPS or something, so I ignore it. But then I get a call from my brother's girlfriend saying she's standing outside. I quickly let her in and she walks in with her and my brother's pet dog and a *full* plate of Christmas dinner, complete with a ziploc bag of dinner rolls. The dog lies at her feet and sleeps as the two of us chatter about everything and nothing until we both realise it's ten pm, and she should get going and I should take my medication. It might be one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me."
