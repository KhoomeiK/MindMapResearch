I did not base my accusation of Trump's corrupt behavior on his calling out of someone else being corrupt. I said that his ability to recognize corruption comes from being familiar with it, because he himself is objectively corrupt, based on years of evidence going back long before the hurricane. If that doesn't make sense, then oh well."

Let me restate: Trump's response to the crisis in Puerto Rico was awful, late in coming, and poorly coordinated. It created a perfect opening for corruption to occur. Trump then used that corruption to excuse his further denial of service to PR. He opened the door, then acted shocked when someone predictably walked through."

But I agree, it sucks when corruption gets passed over to make Trump look bad. He doesn't need the help and it discredits worthy voices by association.

But might I point out that a properly functioning federal response to the hurricane would have included enough oversight to make sure that the aid got where it needed to go? Trump's not less corrupt and incompetent just because other people are also guilty of corruption."
