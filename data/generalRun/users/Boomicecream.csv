AskMen,ff60o06,t3_erlbbu,1579616099.0,"Comparatively this wasn't that terrible but it was my first real date. I (f barely 21 at the time) met a woman at a bar and she asked for my number. She was cute and I was trying to prove I was an adult so I mustered up my courage and asked her to meet at a fancyish bar that was also known for its food. I got to the bar way too early and just ordered a beer. She gets there and orders a drink and we start talking. No real chemistry. We eventually discover that she's about 23 she thought I was much older. No big deal. Then suddenly as we are sitting there a guy about her age comes up and says ""Michelle?!"" in a very accusatory voice. She introduced him as her brother then excuses herself for a moment. They walk about ten feet away and I chew my beer. Then she starts yelling ""THIS IS WHO I AM AND I'LL DATE WHOEVER I WANT!"" she comes back over to me and puts her arm around me  and looks like she's going to come in for a kiss Daiichi I kind of move away from. Her brother sits down at a booth directly in my eye line and states daggers at us. Apparently she was from a very religious family and had very very recently come out. I gave her a ride home (on my moped) and we kind of mutually ghosted each other. Abby other circumstances that's just gay dating but this was MY FIRST DATE. So it goes."

nextfuckinglevel,fegp0fh,t3_ep08v0,1579099117.0,It is a common misconception that the Amish are not permitted to use electricity or modernized technology. This is not necessarily the case. They are compelled to be self sufficient communities. For instance using a Tractor is acceptable as long as the wheels are made from wood or metal but not rubber because wood or metal can be repaired locally but rubber tires require dependance on outsiders. This is also why cell phones are used by some Amish but house phones that would require an outsider to come into the community are not.
