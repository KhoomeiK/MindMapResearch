MurderedByWords,ffe29tt,t1_ffd0icg,1579834825.0,"Honestly, she can't be objective, so she's not acting totally like a therapist and in that sense and it sounds like she enjoys talking/hearing you out as a friend.

 Which makes sense given the whole becoming a therapist thing. Like the other respondent said, it's up to her to set boundaries IMO. -A trained but not practicing therapist"

Yeah, my wife and I are both teachers. Combined we are able to pull it off, but it's a crazy amount of money. Basically a second rent/mortgage. 

Honestly don't see how we could afford two in daycare at the same time. And I'm sure we're not alone, so you're spot on about it being a huge barrier I think."

worldnews,fehwaex,t1_fegq0fv,1579125135.0,How about the fact that polling shows independence moving into a statistical dead heat with remain when the EU question is considered vs. a 10 point lead to remain that existed in the referendum?
worldnews,fegl13u,t1_fefvxc1,1579096061.0,"I just don't see how the potential to lose the EU by voting to be independent wasn't an issue though for many people.

If my city declared independence from my US state, whether we were to remain in the US or not would be an incredibly significant issue. (And in the US, the  majority of powers/law is with the state, so the comparison has at least some merit IMO)."
worldnews,fegkn6g,t1_feg60v8,1579095687.0,I think whether it had zilch to do with EU is a matter of perspective as it likely was a key issue for many voters.

madlads,fef7845,t1_fee7hr9,1579049822.0,"Yeah, that's basically the reality i see. Sure, if all the stars aligned, things can turn around, but it's probably not in the wheel house of a single teacher to affect enough of a student's life to make that happen."
madlads,fee6225,t1_fedbese,1579027145.0,"I legit think some teachers think they can get through to kids if they try and work overly hard to keep them in class.

Of course if your failures are too high, admin will be down your neck, but you learn how to deal with that."
madlads,fee5hyk,t1_fediws7,1579026812.0,"This is why I don't bother. I have a talk with students who are obviously just trying to get out of class, but at the end of the day aside from any potential risk, it's a time suck to argue with kids about going to the bathroom. If they're that insistent on missing class time, I'm not gonna waste the rest of the class' time arguing over it."
todayilearned,fe3r7b8,t1_fe1fbub,1578852068.0,I think they would only used for formulas that are lactose based as it is. Though i suppose the point is kinda moot since it seems the big manufacturers are synthesizing HMOs anyway.

todayilearned,fdyaxxc,t1_fdwkrln,1578777867.0,"Yes, which is funny cuz I've used Enfamil to supplement for my LO partly for that reason. Totally forgot to put both of them in the post! They also are extracting (or maybe synthesizing?) MFGM. Think they're the only US formula doing that so far."
todayilearned,fdvelks,t1_fdvcoa1,1578746647.0,"Interestingly HMOs can now be synthesized and added to formula. Similac and Enfamil in the States have been doing this for a little while now. Certainly nothing is as optimal as breast milk (case in point the changing nature of breast milk that you point out), but it's a definite positive. 

Side note: Oligosaccharides in bovine milk are also extractable and are very similar to human Oligosaccharides, but I'm guessing HMO synthesis is probably preferable."

""Social democracy is a political, social and economic philosophy that supports economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a liberal democratic polity and a capitalist-oriented economy.""

If those countries are willing to sacrifice prosperity or safety because they dislike the personality of an elected leader then they are probably not a material partner.

AskReddit,fdpbt5u,t1_fdpaomt,1578624701.0,"I understand it's easy for the media to simplify the distinction between the two, but there's a pretty fundamental difference between Socialism and [Social Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy). The latter of which is fairly common (hence it also being referenced as the Nordic Model) and still pretty reliant on capitalism.
