Those workers that might lose their jobs (I don't even know if that's accurate) will now have their college debts wiped out, healthcare that isn't absurdly expensive and have a have a good chance of finding new opportunities. But besides, I think giving people losing jobs as a reason not to change a system that bankrupts thousands a year and leaves millions un- or underinsured, costing lives is a bit silly. A bit like the argument slave owners used when slavery was abolished.

A healthier population will be more economically productive too, so that would be an impulse to the economy. Besides, the green new deal will open up a lot of job opportunities in lots of fields, administrative too.

Illegals will get care now too. Because that's the right thing to do? I don't get where you are going with that. Al humans have a right to healthcare.

politics,feeqk9k,t1_feei8ok,1579039102.0,"1. yang's ubi will replace welfare so people who already receive welfare will not benefit
2. without any rent control in place landlords are free to raise prices
3. the price of goods will rise
4. there is no way to pay for the freedom divident without cutting somewhere, and yang isn't clear about where he will get this money from. ($3tr/y)
5. the money spend on richer/middle class people can be more efficiently spend to raise up the poor
6. nowhere in yang's plan does he tax the richest americans. He's a capitalist and will do nothing to adress the giant wealth inequality between the middle class and the rich.
7. The richer you are the less you spend on commodities, so that money at the richer end of the spectrum will end up in savings, not directly into the economy.
8. The freedom divident makes it easier for companies to lower the wages of their workers.
9. Makes no substantial change to the healthcare system
10. most americans are in debt and the money would go straight to paying off this debt, not helping the economy at all
11. Doesn't solve the problem with automation? Wasn't this the main reason? People out of work will receive a non livable freedom divident.
12. yang wants to tax goods more with a vat tax which hurts te poor the hardest because it's a way larger chunk of their income than middle class or rich people.

There are a bajillion reasons more you can find online.

So let's say. You're poor. Living of welfare, the freedom divident is less than what you received prior. You won't get food stamps, the vat tax on products makes them more expensive and your landlord raised the prices of your living space because everyone now has a thousand dollars 'more'. you're already at min wage so lucky you.

Let's say you're rich, you don't need that 1000 bucks. You wipe your ass with it. It will be thrown onto the money pile and sits there until it's inherited,

Let's say you're middle class. You have college debt. All your divident goes straight towards paying off your college debt. Non of that money is spend to drive the economy. Also groceries are now more expensive. Wages will increase even more slowly than they do now.  You have your freedom divident after all.

So you lose your job. It got automated. Luckily you have a thousand bucks a month to live off. Rent will be half if not more. good luck with the rest of your expenses.

Who does this benefit? Businesses. This all doesn't matter anyway because Yang will never get close to the presidency and ubi will not be implemented."
