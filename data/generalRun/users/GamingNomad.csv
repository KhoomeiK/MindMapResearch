selfimprovement,ffigchv,t3_etsp8j,1579973211.0,"Small steps help. Stop the negative thoughts, and drop all negativity in your speech. Never speak negatively or yourself or feel sorry for yourself, only do so when you're with a good friend and only rarely.

If you control your thoughts *and* your speech you will become more positive and you'll feel better. People becoming more attracted to you is only a by-product, it's not the real reward."

transformers,ffhwv12,t3_etgpo3,1579957459.0,"As a kid watching the movie I thought very deeply about this. I mean it's Megatron turns into Galvatron, but did Galvatron think of himself as Megatron, or someone else? What was his perception?

I always loved his exchange with Starscream ""Megatron? Is that you?"" Starscream sees something, and Galvatron leaves a vague hint. Is Megatron still in there somewhere?

This was very deep for me at that age. Good memories."
