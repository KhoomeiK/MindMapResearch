DadReflexes,felcvt5,t1_fel2fni,1579219206.0,"I don't know why you're being downvoted, I see parental negligence every day. I drive for Uber and Lyft and I have to refuse probably one or two trips a week because of it. They'll want to just buckle up a 2 year old with no seat at all or just carry their babies in their lap. Then they get mad at me like I'm being rude by not accepting the liability of their children's safety.

Sometimes they'll have a seat but they want me to buckle it in. Nope. I'm not taking any steps that would put me in the line of fire."

I'll have to see if I can find the link, but there was one on the front page a couple of weeks ago where they removed the oil pan and a blob of old oil with a viscosity of a jello mold stayed behind. You could even read where the stamped markings on the oil pan left their mark behind."
ChrisRamsay52,fdpnjsa,t3_em8opw,1578633782.0,"Wait, what am I missing? Is it just the literal color change by painting the card red or is there something I'm not seeing that I'm supposed to be mystified by?"

Breath_of_the_Wild,fc7jsn9,t1_fc7hukf,1577509678.0,"I couldn't tell you off the top of my head how many hours I've put into the game. After finishing it the first time, (obviously not 100%) I put it down for probably a year and just recently picked it back up. 

Right now I'm trying to use the ""Hero's Path Mode"" to paint the map like a etch a sketch filled with pea soup."
airsoft,fc7jdlb,t1_f455ime,1577509287.0,"Yes it would be difficult to make the mistake of pulling the wrong weapon but I do have to argue with another part of your comment. 

If you're really concealing properly the last thing used to described your firearm should be inaccessible, but I get what you're saying- I'm just nitpicking.

You'll have to forgive my lack of knowledge when it comes to airsoft- but do they really make these things where you can't  immediately determine which is which based simply on weight? 

I own several handguns and after getting used to them at the range I can dicern the weight difference between loaded and unloaded. I have a buddy that's a police officer and with most pistols he could tell you the make/model, caliber and how many rounds are in the magazine just using touch and weight."

My method of baking is very similar. Only instead of a deck of cards you throw all of the ingredients into the air and simultaneously hurdle a preselected amount of measuring cups and a stick butter towards an open oven door. 

My specialty is called Fuego de la Casa. Tastes better if you substitute an ingredient of your choosing with just a hint of third degree burns and a smattering of ""Did I Buy that Renter's Insurance?"""

Sure, I'll remember it right after it happens and I wind up rolling down 37 miles of cliffs into a lava pond below. But without exception once I leave the area all memories of my folly escape like steam from my brain. I'll find myself back in Goron for whatever reason and here we go!

It doesn't even have to be a long absence. I'm like your dog when you come back home after being gone for five minutes. It's the exact same over the top, tail-wagging, drooling and nervous reaction as if you were gone two years.

Breath_of_the_Wild,fc5tnrq,t1_fc50yek,1577465630.0,"Those all sound like valid reasons, especially since you still took the time to put in that much game play. 

However, I would argue that a good bit of the shrines are amazing, very immersive puzzles that have the potential to throw you for a pretty good loop until you figure it on"
