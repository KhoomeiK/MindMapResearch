The solution?  Control your dreams. 

I know it sounds like a load of bullshit but hear me out.  I cant remember the phenomenon name but you can progress to a point where you can be in control in your dreams.

It starts out with as soon as you wake up, try and remember what you dreamed about.  Write it down if you have to.  Think about every detail.  Emotion.  Sight. 

Keep doing this and it will get to the point where you know you are in a dream, but cant really do much yet. 

Then it goes to the point where you know you are in a dream and can sort of control things.  That is where I'm at and it's legit pretty interesting."

depression,ff4ry6f,t3_ermuik,1579571000.0,"A very long story cut short, my late fiance was in the hospital and I had just broken the news that it was terminal and he was fading fast.  

Needing comfort, I curled up beside him in the hospital bed so we could grieve together.  

Sometime later his nurse on duty came in and saw us cuddling each other on the bed.  

Frowning, he said...""Well, its only supposed to be the patient in the bed...""

Then promptly took two steps back, drew the privacy curtain across the door and we hear a muffled, ""Well, *I* don't see anything!"" and quietly departed.  

That nurse was an honest to God angel.  We were on that floor for two and a half weeks and he allowed us more freedoms that we probably should have been allowed.  He told me I was free to raid the nearby linen closet for whatever I needed to take care of my fiance, and if someone had a problem they could take it up with him. 

He also helped surprise my Drew with an impromptu wedding in the hospital.  He let us commandeer one of the private family gathering spaces so I didn't have to try and slip into my dress in some bathroom and let my mom sneak in a rose I could hold during the ceremony (no live flowers allowed in the wing).

Bless his heart, he even timed his nurse checks so we didn't have to try and wake Drew again later (he was only responding to noxious stimulation at this point).

Breathe mama, you got this!

For baking we used almond milk (its sweeter) and Earth Balance sticks which melted like ""real"" butter. 

Some of the family favorite recipes that we either substituted or omitted the dairy stuff and it turned out amazing :

I use a baking soda bath, and then drain off as much water as I can by flailing it above the pot of water sitting on its slotted spoon."
Cooking,fcfq2i1,t3_egxof6,1577632674.0,"I once had a pot boil over and start smoking to beat the band on my glass topped stove.  

I thought I remembered seeing someone using salt on Worst Cooks in America to put out the fire so I literally dumped salt everywhere like I was a priest slaying some demons!  

Found out afterward it was baking soda and NOT salt.  Salt pitted the stove top rather badly.  Don't do it kids."

Think like meatloaf with canned salmon.  It tasted okay until I bit down onto something hard.  I spat it out and asked what it was (Grandma was in the kitchen grabbing another pan of it) and Dad said it was a fish eye socket...

She used canned salmon but didn't clean the bones out."

BOW was an amazing game (be prepared to die quite a bit in the beginning) and another two favorites of mine are Mario Oddessy and Stardew Valley. 

Heck to the yes you should game!  If it sounds like fun or interesting despite your depression (which can overshadow everything) then full steam ahead!"
