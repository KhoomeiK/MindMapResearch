I can't kill myself even though I really want to. The suffering can be overwhelming, and it sucks to know that you're at the mercy of other people's carelessness and insensitivity.

I don't even think my depression is an irrational emotional response. I mean, is it really unreasonable to get why people become sick of life?"
depression,fg638aw,t3_ex23k2,1580551269.0,You're definitely not alone. Dreams are emotionally vivid and intense. The contrast in consciousness between dreams and reality is akin to the difference between eating the greatest burger of all time and eating paper. It's not even a question whether or not I'd prefer to live in a dreaming state.
SuicideWatch,fg35kqe,t3_ewm7ft,1580471234.0,"Reading the way people have treated you, it seems like you've got it the other way around. Other people are careless, selfish and don't deserve to be loved in my opinion. But that's the catch, isn't it? Deserve has nothing to do with it in this world. The guilty walk away scot-free.

Anyways, same here. I hate my parents for having me. Every day."

But in all seriousness, sometimes thinking that life is finite and will undoubtedly end brings me some comfort. Another thing I do is to remind myself that with each new day, I'm one step closer to death.

Another approach I'm taking is to try to optimize the amount of pleasure/comfort I will experience in life. (I know, obvious right?) The only way I see myself being ""somewhat"" content existing is by amassing wealth. Life is just REALLY, REALLY FUCKING BAD, retarded and has ZERO possibility of being a positive-sum game and will always be in a negative-sum state. The only logical thing to do is have a shit ton of pleasures to offset as much of the pain as you possibly can. I've genuinely come to believe that if there's anything that's going to profoundly mitigate against the unbearable pain, it has to be material possessions. Anything to shut the pain off. 

If I had the choice to either stop existing as soon as possible or live in luxury and sensory indulgence, I'd press the button to stop existing without hesitation. No question. But since killing myself is impossible, (I've tried, but I just couldn't do it and I don't think I ever will) living a life of high pleasure is the only thing that makes sense since I'm trapped here. I'm not saying you should live hedonistically without any ethical consideration for others, but there needs to be some level of hedonism applied to counter the irritations and frustrations that inherently comes with being conscious."
depression,fel6uyz,t3_epileo,1579215326.0,"This fleshy body thing really is just one big pain in the ass. It really feels like I'm perpetually enslaved to feeding this insect, otherwise I'll suffer the consequences of not maintaining it."
depression,fel657b,t1_fejmkod,1579214883.0,"The only thing about air that makes me feel dirty is that somewhere beneath my ribcage, there are these gross pink squishy things that inflate and deflate every few seconds. Have you seen a pair of lungs inflating? It's like, really, really gross. If you've seen Robocop (2014), you know what I mean."
