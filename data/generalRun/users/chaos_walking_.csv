assholedesign,fffbk3f,t1_fff8m0u,1579880344.0,"The “compatible with other brands” is almost certainly on the box to clear up vagueness, not create it. I agree that literally stating the dimensions of the toys would be even clearer, but I wouldn’t call the entire box “vague” because they left the smallest sliver of ambiguity as they explain what is inside the box. By that definition of “vague”, you could poke holes in almost anything. “I have brown hair” would be vague, because “technically i might be talking about my pubes, not my head hair”. I’d say the phrase “compatible with other brands” is not vague in its context because most people would understand its meaning. If the advertiser took advantage of that collective understanding and meant some obscure miniature brands, that would for sure be assholery. Is there a collective understanding that big box = full box? No, and i do not think that should be an assumption by general consumers."
assholedesign,fff82xp,t1_fff7f7a,1579878058.0,Nothing vague to me about what was on that box. Whats more vague is simply guessing what’s inside based off size. Many people would easily deduce what is in that box by reading it. Why people like you aren’t just reading it and instead basing your purchase on something as vague as the size of a box beats me...
assholedesign,fff45ys,t1_fff3hzg,1579875227.0,"So you’re saying as a consumer that we should figure out what we are buying by the size of the box over what is printed on the box? I agree with you, the explanation could be even clearer by saying “these are knockoff legos sized xxx”, but what they have written on the box is enough to to know what you are purchasing, is it really not? I don’t think one is being a smart consumer if they assume they know what they are buying by looking at the size of the package. I do not think that small product + big opaque package = asshole design should be a rule."
assholedesign,fff33td,t1_fff2jnl,1579874403.0,It says “Compatible with other brands” so it seems to be telling you that they’ll be a standard size that fits with blocks like Legos.
assholedesign,fff2h58,t1_fff12z9,1579873907.0,"You’re absolutely right there is no room for conjecture in a simple picture of the box. That is why i am defending the box, actually. IT DID NOT LIE. The first “conjecture” occurred when the customer assumed the appearance of the pieces they were buying when they could have read into what the box contained specifically in all of 3 extra seconds."
assholedesign,fff0x9c,t1_fff0r4s,1579872629.0,"And what, then, is this entire post and comment section?"
assholedesign,fff0jt9,t1_ffezsk4,1579872311.0,"Well this box was finally sold at an Ollie’s, so likely more than one company deemed this box size OK and worth it to ship across the country to be sold. And if any company would be concerned about needlessly shipping half empty boxes due to costs, I’m pretty sure it would be the bargain outlet."
assholedesign,ffezpof,t1_ffez171,1579871563.0,Smuttly is a little loud but he’s right; you have no idea how cost management works in packaging design. Its often way cheaper to use an ill-fitting box a company already has thousands of than to order a new box design for each product.

The only options aren’t “let them guess and get it wrong” and “tell them and watch them get it wrong”. Say you’re using all the gift money you get this year to put towards ______ later. They should be happy to contribute to your plan. They were asking what you want because they DONT KNOW YOUR INTERESTS well enough. Good on em for asking, they care more than some."

todayilearned,fdvy4f2,t1_fdvw4qt,1578753088.0,"That does sound very plausible; im pretty sure my parents were also introducing solids to me, but probably not as much as other kids. had a new baby bro when i was 2, so my parents (who still hadnt stopped breastfeeding me) may still have been focused on buying soft foods for him and maybe spent less time expanding my diet. Too many different textures is a big issue for me, probably because i didnt even start trying full “meals” until i was like 3 (before that all i remember is fruit, veggies, spaghetti Os and fish sticks, singular items like that, no dishes with numerous ingredients)"
rareinsults,fdvw6od,t1_fdtlxl1,1578752327.0,So ive seen the clip of her saying the n word but im having a lot of trouble finding her actual “part black” response. Can someone who knows of it actually link it? I want to know if this is all true but i cant find all the apparent evidence that exists.
rareinsults,fdvvg9d,t1_fdtopkp,1578751960.0,What if you are trying to talk about how some black people use the word “nigga” when referring to each other? Was i not supposed to quote “nigga” just then? Am i racist for acknowledging the word exists without censoring my quote?
rareinsults,fdvuhiv,t3_emzkmb,1578751645.0,"Unless i watched the wrong clip, she literally said it while explaining why she believes black people use it. Literally didn’t say it herself, she was just quoting black people in general. Wtf reddit, i thought we cared about context!"

On a less serious note, the only time i had someone peek me changing in a clothing store was by a 5ish yo boy with his mom (who was changing in the stall next to me). I turned around topless and theres a little kid just laying on the floor between the stalls blatantly staring. I gasped and covered my lil gals quick (also non-bra wearing) and kinda laughed cuz i was not expecting a little child to just be chillin there. His mom who was also changing in the stall next to me gasped and yanked him back saying “so sorry” and immediately started yelling at him about how disrespectful that is. Glad she addressed it with so much importance, although i kinda still wish she woulda made him face me and apologize himself."
