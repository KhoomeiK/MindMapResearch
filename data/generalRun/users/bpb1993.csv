I wanna go back to studying as well in September. Never finished college so far as well because of having bipolar disorder. 
Good luck to you, what are you studying?"
bipolar,fda653d,t1_fc31qmi,1578242229.0,"Hmm yeah that's hard. I'm lucky and unlucky at the same time to have so much other bipolar relatives. So my family understands most of it. Maybe you have a friend who you can talk to if your family might not be the best option? It's always scary but I feel like making this a secret for everyone is a really heavy load to bear.
Even though I have relatives diagnosed way before me, when I got my diagnosis sometimes my family also thought I was going through a manic episode or being depressed while just having a weird day or anything. But in my situation it was them fearing that I might have an episode again, since in the beginning they were really heavy and destructive."

bipolar,fcklf3r,t3_ehogyb,1577727880.0,"No you're not stupid for still being friends with people you have formed such a close bond with. I know the feeling, it's great to have people around who can relate on a personal level. But if you feel like you're stable now and those people totally aren't, they could drag you down with them in their problems. It might be good to have a chat with them about it, tell them you want to support them or help them, but not if it jepardizes your own mental health."
bipolar,fckkamc,t3_ehosaa,1577727182.0,"Does your therapist know that you're not taking prescripted drugs anymore and are smoking weed? I have been smoking weed on and off since I'm 15. I'm 26 now. Luckily weed doesn't have too much of a physical withdrawl when you stop smoking it. For me, cold turkey is the only way to stop it. Once I allow myself to smoke ""just a little bit"", within a week or so I'm back at my old dose. I do have a love hate relationship with it, it makes me more relaxed at times and I enjoy it. But sometimes it just makes my anxiety and moods even worse or make me paranoid. As long as you feel it works well for you, you might not have to quit. I'm not sure if you have a risk of getting a psychotic episode since you have bipolar type 2 (I have type 1). But be careful, there is a connection between smoking a lot of pot and psychosis.  At least for the real strong kinds, what most of them are over here in Holland."
bipolar,fckb1zp,t3_ehmvy2,1577721270.0,"First of all: It's really great of you that you went to see a therapist! It takes courage to admit that you're not ok. It also is the first step to dealing with all your emotions a little bit better and if you receive the right meds, you'll see that after a while you will feel better. Also the talking helps. I have to be honest, it would be a lie to say that you will be ""cured"" after starting therapy and drugs, but every step counts and it does help in being more stable! 
Also, do your closest relatives or friends know about your struggle? I know it is scary and not everyone is going to understand you, but it can feel like a much bigger burden if no one knows, besides your therapist. 
If your family abroad knows and you're struggling so much on your own atm and with money, maybe they could help you with your money issues a bit or you could visit them for a while maybe? Sometimes life is just too hard to do it all by yourself and even though it might feel like you have to fix everything on your own, there is no shame in accepting some help from time to time. Maybe you could ask your therapist, when more sure about your diagnosis, if there is a group of other bipolar people you could talk with. They can relate to you on a level that no one else ever can. And that feels really good from time to time. 
I've been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder I almost 9 years ago now. I struggled with it so much in the beginning and had a lot of manic episodes and a very long depressed one. Because of my age when I got diagnosed (18), I wasn't able to keep up with a lot of the studies I tried then. But I'm happy to say that for a couple of years now I'm doing a lot better :) I'm going back to study in September, and if I finish that, I'll be able to help other people with mental health issues and addicition, based on my own experiences:)
After a while you'll get to know yourself more, your mental health issues and what you have to do in or cut out of your life to stay more stable and even feel mostly happy. For most people, things as excercising regularly and try to have set times for sleeping and getting up etc. already helps:) I also think a lot of your quality of life has got to do with (self)acceptance as well. I'm not totally accepting every struggle that comes with this disorder yet, but I've came a long way. And so can youâ™¡ you're not alone in this, stay strong:)"
bipolar,fc2jyq7,t1_fbwt7ya,1577364106.0,"Maybe you could start with the family members you really trust or have a good connection with? But maybe don't tell them all at the same time. That might be a lot scarier to do than telling a couple and one at a time ;)
Be prepared that not everyone is always gonna understand you (at first). And tell them whenever you feel the time is right, or just when it's really necessary. 
Good luck!!"
bipolar,fc2jnla,t1_fc14lzk,1577363688.0,"Aw why were you avoiding family? Hope you had a nice Christmas day still:) btw, I don't think you can add anyone. I'm new to Reddit too. But if you want to ask something, you can just click my name and send a message on chat (just discovered that haha)  I'm so glad you like the songs :) Find it really cool someone else is relating to them as well now :D"
