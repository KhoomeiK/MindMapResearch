unpopularopinion,fgvngyo,t3_f0o5nw,1581150966.0,"Women are born with the natural inclination to be competitive against one another, unfortunately in the modern this is unneccessary most of the time and we show it in an ugly way.  The ""put down others to rise up"" is common.

I've worked in a lot of retail/offices and I've never met another woman who disagrees, but you get only women together and there **will** be gossip, there **will** cliques, and it will be hard to escape it.  I don't enjoy toxic environments like anyone else, but as a woman, I know to avoid them it's best to have mixed environments. 

The sport in which I do, there is a 'women's only' group - this group is taught by people at a 'just leaving high school' age and this is even more problematic.  For some reason, the three women (young adults) teaching are toxic FOR NO REASON.  The others in the class are great people.  In mixed, no matter how long you take, no matter what -- every person is incredible to engage with.  The contrast is staggering."

However, using the same method and ingredients will definitely get you a mostly dissolved body - they are toxic to humans and will stink.  What you also need is a lot of time, it’s not going to happen within a few minutes, it’s going to take time - many, many hours.  

Both are going to eventually attack and destroy most of your body.  Even using lye on its own won’t leave a perfect liquid behind.  Hence my mention of a pressurised container."

suspiciouslyspecific,fghwf1f,t1_fghvm0s,1580795943.0,"If you want to cut a body up, fine.  You can, it's easier for the acid too - slightly. 

Also you DO NOT want to put any acid down your drains when it's contaminated with human goop.  Even if it's 100% liquid, you're still opening yourself up to a potential connection if trace evidence were to be discovered.  Now or in 10 years. 

If you are going to be cutting up a body to dissolve it in your weenie container: 

* Where are you going to be cutting it? 
* When you start cutting, you're going to be using a lot of force and exertion, so please make sure you have sharp instruments - it's still a lot of work 
* Then you have to be prepared to remove any liquids that are draining out 
* You have to make sure you cover every surface in the room incase of trace evidence (including yourself)
* It also creates another 'spot' the body was in (for maximum success, you need to have a minimal amount of spots the body is in)
* Most people get caught by trace evidence, if a victim's single shed of hair is inside your apartment then you're immediately a suspect

So now, you have an entire room, plastic sheets, a table/surface, an instrument, your protective gear, etc that you now need to have removed from existence.  I'd reccommend melting in the same acid.  It would be more interesting, but it opens you up to A LOT more risks. 

If you want to start murdering, I'd suggest start hiking in random areas, ones where you're gone for a day or two.  Make a lot of friends who do not hike, if they are interested, encourage them and maybe let them come sometimes but have it be known it's your solo time.  Then after about five years, you can should be very much aware of the area that you can understand foot traffic, areas untouched, etc.  Set up a spot where you can take these people, that you can store what you need, but you will NEVER put a body in any hiking spot.  Just an idea."

suspiciouslyspecific,fghv60b,t1_fghq8qq,1580794811.0,"Yes, if you want it completely dissolved you'd need a pressurised chamber.  To dissolve in lye and water in a normal container, the boiling point wouldn't reach beyond 100 degrees celcius wheras you need atleast double that.  

You COULD do it Breaking Bad style (hydrofluoric acid in a plastic container).  As long as you have time with either, you will be able to achieve it. 

If you do want to dissolve a body in acid: 

* Where are you sourcing the acid from?  There will be traces.  Be careful, it's not like you're buying eggs.
* Use a container you ALREADY own or have acquired (preferrably with a lid): if you do not own a large barrel, find one because if you have to cut up the body - you're opening yourself up to a lot of trace evidence.  Small container?  Sit the person in and feed the body in as it slowly dissolves
* When dumping, best to dump in waterways (not low ones either, maybe the ocean if you can get there)
* Burn the container (to eliminate trace evidence)
* Remember safety first!  Full suit, goggles, gloves and face mask.

Like I always say, ""never kill someone you know""."
