Had a buddy PCS (move bases) and they were giving him a medal (basically given to anyone who doesn't fuck up). As they were reading his bullets (bulleted achievements), I realized they were reading mine. I gave him a look of 'wtf?' and he gave me a look of shock. I didn't really care, he was a good dude, one of the nicest guys.

She is the jealous type and it eats her up. I don't want to be like that so I don't even want to look or think about that stuff but if I came home and saw another man in my apartment that is not the local repair guy, I am kicking her to the curb."

You don't have to join the military or work for govt. You can go to community College 2 years then transfer to a 4 year. I didn't get into some big large university that cost much. I went to a smaller university, excelled there which lead to getting picked up by govt while I was still in college. I have free time so I'll be pursuing a Masters since I have left over GI bill."

leagueoflegends,ffhtpe7,t1_ffh9qa8,1579953396.0,I like c9 but I love Sneaky stream because I'm an adc and Sneaky is usually cool headed when shit goes bad such as his support or JG inting bot. He is sarcastic but better than someone raging into the mic or saying 'so bad' repeatedly like doublelift. I noticed he is becoming a bit more toxic like how qtpie went from funny to toxic but I don't watch streams as often because I have to be up by 6am and Sneaky streams late.

leagueoflegends,ffh4qrv,t1_ffgolzb,1579923077.0,"It depends on elo I think. I'm in plat and even people who don't play ADC seem to do fine since a lot of supports I get are autofilled so it is like a free pass to the enemy. The only major parts is team fighting and late game. Late game, adc has to be very cautious from getting 1 shot by the midlaner. I don't know how many times I've played a near perfect game with a bad team and I get blown up first late game. Shouldn't happen but an autofilled adc usually throws more often in that scenario than a main."

A gentleman told asked for the wait and I told him 45 mins and he asked me if there was any way to make it go faster and I said no. He puts a $20 in my breastpocket and I bumped him up to the next table. It was kind of forced upon me but in that situation, I just ran with it since I was getting minimum wage.

What amazes me was he was active duty and did 2 tours in middle east so he must have been studying or something while in the military. I used to do that in the military and that is why I got out. This guy probably did what I did for 4 months for most of his life. My days started at 6 am and I went to bed at midnight on school nights.
