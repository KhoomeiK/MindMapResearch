television,fff52hx,t1_ffdwsiv,1579875900.0,"Having a master's degree in engineering does not mean that you automatically see things perfectly and everyone else is wrong. I never said you believe in anything and I never  directly tied your statement to a belief. I stated that you are bias and you hyper focus on things without looking at things as a whole. Which now makes more sense since you are an engineer. That's your job. To focus on individual aspects of a whole. It, however, does NOT mean that you understand the whole picture. I work with engineers constantly and they repetitively fuck shit up that is blatantly apparent. I blame that more on not being in the field or not listening to others. I don't believe he was using a strawman fallacy because he didn't refute something that you didn't say. He took an understanding of your concept, which was a very real thing because you used language to communicate an idea, and went off of that. A strawman fallacy is if we argue that Trump left the Paris agreement over such and such reason, and then I try to refute the fact that he has a piss tape. Neither have anything to do with each other. I would be refuting something that has no application in our current conversation. So, if I was you, if stop waving around ""oh I have a master's I'm obviously smarter than you so fuck off"" mentality. You have book smarts and mathematical inclination. That, in NO way, shows an understanding of geopolitics or literally any other subject. So, I suggest, while talking about politics, don't use engineering as a scapegoat."
television,ffdvzzg,t1_ffdv41t,1579830306.0,"Ah. Click phrases like strawman haha. *Sigh* it's not a strawman because it's directly articulating a fact that your education level is unfathomable to the individual reading your statements. I believe what is being stated is that you're unreasonably bias, your rational thought is unwarranted, and that they feel sorry our government was not able to give you proper education. Being suspicious of any type of authority is completely fine. We literally ALL do that. You, however, have a knack, it seems, for hyper-focusing on a general output that you can't readily explain. I get it though. We all have our worries.

Job regulations are basically non existent down here. I'm a temp, I get no benefits. No PTO, and if I'm late 3 times or miss work 3 times, I'm immediately fired. For any reason. Medical? You're fired. Family? You're fired. Sick? You're fired. It's bullshit and that's why I'm a Democrat. Shit needs regulation. Fuck anyone who says ""FrEe MaRkEt."""

politics,fcyks5n,t1_fcyk8pj,1578081808.0,"Almost all of that is attributed to Obama and policies that he passed which are too difficult for Trump to rescind. Remember, the first two years of a presidency are never policies passed by the current sitting president. They are policies put into motion by the previous president before leaving office. The economy was already healing from the last war, it's just continued to do so. Trump hasn't really passed any bills that specifically help employment or economical factors, in fact in some cases he did something, people thought it was a good idea, turns out it was a bad idea, and now people and farmers are losing jobs and business.

ALMOST all policies within the first two years, I won't say all. That was a mistake"
