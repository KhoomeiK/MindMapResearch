books,ffeitze,t1_ffedwhl,1579849766.0,There's a lot of hate for him because of what he has said about transgender people and laws that protect him. He's very popular with far right wing conservatives because of it.
books,ff4tkhm,t1_ff3jflh,1579572116.0,"Lewis created Emeth, the Calormene, because of his views of salvation. Lewis also believed that anything good, and any prayer, came from God. ""For I and he are such different kinds that no service which is vie can be done to me, and none which is not vile can be done to him"", which I wh at Aslan told Emeth. Basically saying that anything good that is done, is done for Aslan, while anything bad that is done, is done for Tash. 

I think the best example of Lewis' theology about Emeth is in the book Mere Christianity, where he writes: ""We do know that no man can be saved except through Christ; we do not know that only those who know Him can be saved through Him"".

Even as a kid reading The Last Battle, Emeth's story stuck out to me. I've never really seen anything like it in other Christian-related media, and I think it's one reason why Lewis' writing is a classic."
rpg,ff2us8o,t3_erbq08,1579524986.0,"HeartQuest by Seraphim Guard is an rpg so you can play in the world of shoujo manga/anime. Examples of settings it has are like teen romance or magical girl (like Sailor Moon). The game uses the Fudge system, so instead of giving traits numbers like in D&D, you put them on a scale that grows from Terrible to Superb. To test a skill or attribute you roll 4d6, or 4 Fudge dice, with sides representing either a plus, blank, or minus, add the results and that either brings your skill up or down."

Hypocrisy (noun): the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform.

I don't see how it's hypocrisy to show how idiotic it is to call cultural appropriation a form of flattery. But then again definition of words don't seem to be your strong point."

todayilearned,fejvhby,t1_fej3v2j,1579186790.0,"It's like you didn't ready my comment. I specifically said it's bad if everyone was given antibiotics jist because they're sick, then you give examples of diseases that are caused by viruses, not bacteria!"
todayilearned,feixvtj,t1_feiub99,1579150256.0,"My quick Google searches seems to state that researchers are looking at prescribing antibiotics for shorter periods because for some antibiotics the treatment is still effective say in 5 days as much as 10. But that recommending to stop ""when you feel better"" isn't good because the infection might still be there."
todayilearned,feix7uw,t1_feicji2,1579149704.0,"The title that OP used is misleading. If you read the article, Flemming was worried than penicillin would become over the counter, and that anyone could buy it, and then that person doesn't take enough of the antibiotic to kill the bacteria. Instead it only makes them resistant to the antibiotic, and the bacteria spreads.

What you recommend isn't going to prevent superbugs. The reason for superbugs is the using antibiotics when you don't need them (which is why doctors tell you to call them if you don't feel better after starting the antibiotic) or not taking all of the antibiotic when you actually need it (taking it all kills all the bacteria it can and then your immune system can take out the few bacteria that were naturally resistant). 

I'm not saying there isn't an overuse of antibiotics. But saying ""well just tough it out"" isn't very healthy."

HistoryMemes,fctlpr6,t1_fctcpzf,1577947988.0,"To save space, many early computer systems saved space by writing the date as 19xx, instead of having all 4 digits. But because of that, the dating doesn't work for the year 2000, with the system either reading it as 1900 or just glitching. The public were afraid that when new years of 2000 hit, all computers would crash and civilization would gonnack to the stone age.

But programmers were aware of the problem and started fixing it by the 1990s, and nowadays we would have called it a glitch, not a word-ending event."

I'm not talking about the sketchy stuff Monsanto does, I'm talking about GMOs in general.

That could be prevented with GMO crops that are more hardy.
