minipainting,ffnt23q,t3_eu5yv3,1580070418.0,"I mean. Technically anything that isn't ""full size"" and is ""painted"" should work. Right? So like...a midget rolled in mustard.

pcgaming,ffmahc6,t1_ffm6sym,1580051363.0,"You can feel whatever you want. I'm there to feel immersed. And I cant believe that other people don't feel that way. Do you look up everything every time you play a video game? Have you ever played a game and just lost yourself in it? That's what games are to me. Especially PvE games. 

Secondly, most of that shit isn't that hard. Dont stand in red cones or circles on the ground. If you are a healer, heal the tank first. If you are the tank, you hold aggro. If you are DPS you better not get hurt much because nobody has time to heal your ass.

3rd, I have already established that I will say that I've never done it. That means they know I'm a noob and if there is something they need me to know they can let me know. The point is, don't ont be shitty about it.

This shit is like making fun of a blind person for being blind. I can't control that I've never done this raid. And I haven't done anything wrong by being newer than you. Sometimes you just have to deal."
pcgaming,ffl2prx,t1_ffklej2,1580033704.0,"How does wanting to watch the cutscenes that are part of the story of the game once ruin HOURS and HOURS of other people's time? In the (at the time) final mission, there is like...5-7 minutes of cutscenes total. And I'd get kicked from a raid for saying at the beginning that I wanted to watch them because it was my first time through them. That's bullshit. You know how you get a toxic fanbase? Treat people like that. 

You are playing a game. And those people who were mad? They were just grinding anyway. What's a small amount of extra time? You'd rather kill the game for a new person? Have you forgotten you wanted to see that once? Or do people really just not care about that stuff, even in a final fantasy game?"
pcgaming,ffkg4h5,t1_ffke25t,1580022205.0,I was agreeing with that portion of your comment. I was disagreeing with the second. I play games to have fun and lose myself in them. I'm not looking up how to do a fight before I go into it for the first time. Sometimes you die. Someone figured it out for the first time. And that's what I wanna do.
pcgaming,ffkagrr,t1_ffjrl28,1580019593.0,"I hate this attitude. I dont want to look stuff up beforehand. I'm ok if you start a raid and say ""anything I should know?"" But this attitude is what pisses me off in MMOs as well. Just because you have played it a thousand times, doesnt mean you have to ruin the experience of the noobs. People on FFXIV used to regularly kick me when I wanted to see the end of game cutscenes, and it was infuriating."

But he was assured by his doctor that he was fine, just needed to lose some pounds. And then he died."
AskReddit,ffhvi0s,t1_ffhv5ys,1579955814.0,"That's true, but you are just doing what he said. Attributing everything to him being fat. Sometimes things aren't due to that. 

This isn't about fat acceptance or 'healthy at any size.' So many doctors (and people like yourself) automatically just tell you to lose weight any time you say anything is wrong with you, sometimes until it's too late. 

My grandpa went to the doctor and told them he was having trouble with incontinence, and they told him his weight was pushing on his bladder and didnt even check him. Sent him home. He had prostate cancer causing an enlarged prostate. This absolutely happens, is what I'm saying."

One person gains a huge lead and just gets further and further ahead until they will. Barring EXTREMELY rare circumstances. So the game isn't that fun. Good games require balance and for everyone to be having fun at the same time. And strategy is more fun than luck.

Yes, lots of people play it wrong and don't enjoy it because it's long. But people that play it correctly only enjoy it if everyone is a good sport. If the person in the lead is a dick about it, the game is awful. And its mechanics are in the low fun range anyway."

If they say no, the WBC sues the city for discrimination. If they say yes, the WBC members scream terrible things at people until they piss them off, trying to get attacked.
