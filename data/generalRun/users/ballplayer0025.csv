nfl,ff68sa2,t1_ff5wj1r,1579621814.0,I mean....we are 0-7 in our last 7 NFC championship games.....is that a good tie breaker?
mlb,ff42py3,t1_ff3mynw,1579554253.0,"As a Twins fan I want to say Torii, but Lofton is simply my favorite kind of baseball player.  A  traditional lead-off man who stole bases, walked as much as he struck out, and plays great defense.  A guy that could manufacture runs almost by himself.  If I started a Space-Jam like line-up to defeat aliens in baseball, Ricky would be my first pick.  So yeah Kenny and it just isn't close for me."

AskReddit,fejruk8,t1_feivdpy,1579184289.0,"Regrettably I don't as I put all of my disposable income into my animal sanctuary.  You tend to look at trophy hunting on more of a micro level when you actually have relationships with individuals of the targetted animals like Lions, Wolves, and Rhinos.

I have done my homework and I have a good understanding of why the regulated culling of an animal can make financial sense for the species overall in 2020.  That said, whether the hunter is required to pay 100k for a permit that will aide in conservation efforts or not does not change what the root motivation of the hunter is.  That is what people find to be dispicable even if natural resource departments have found a way to turn it into a positive for the survivors.

I do appreciate you asking what I have donated to conservation as my organization survives on donations and so I am a big fan of putting your money where your mouth is.  I also appreciate your apparent passion for conservation.  I would suggest putting that energy into reaching out to the hunters themselves and seeing if they would be willing to simply donate the tag fee to conservation.  Who knows, maybe you will find one that actually cares about the conservation side and not just a head for the wall.  If you do that though, I would refrain from starting off by calling them ""idiots"", that is just disrespectful."

minnesotavikings,fegza5p,t3_ep3fwz,1579105833.0,"I feel like there would definitely have been times where some of these fan bases most hated player was on their own team.  There was a time ours would have said ""Blair Walsh""."
Patriots,fegz14w,t1_fegtr61,1579105679.0,Yeah his tweets towards the Vikings receivers after they lost to the 49ers were pretty petty.

PSVR,fegygoy,t1_fef0dwm,1579105328.0,"I would expect they do, I know other platforms do.  My steam account shows me having almost 250 hours into Witcher 1 and it's because I would leave the game paused for days at a time."
Dodgers,feemmqc,t1_fee2eam,1579036833.0,"Twins fan here.  While the whole ""class action lawsuit"" thing from the fans is of course silly, considering the revenue a market enjoys when it wins a championship in one of the 4 major sports, it doesn't seem totally crazy to me for a city like LA to bring  a lawsuit against the Houston Astros organization for revenue loss based on this.  I suppose it would just depend on if a law, and not a policy, could be found to have been broken."
minnesotavikings,fdsf160,t3_emv6cm,1578701235.0,Moss and it's not close and it has nothing to do with the personnel we already have.  AP would rush for 170 and fumble twice in the 4th.
