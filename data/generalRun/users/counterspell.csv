Chefit,ffuqpoz,t3_ev8vry,1580247510.0,"Like what others have said, don't waste your money. You should look into trade schools in your area that offer the ServSafe certificate. Its usually a 4 week class that can give you basic skills and it will be A LOT cheaper than full on culinary school.

I wanted to be a chef my whole life, and now that I am one, I dislike it most days. Its not as glamorous as it may seem. Its hot and dirty, and gross and like the first comment said, there are some shady mofos in this industry, alcoholism and drug use is rampant.

Work in a restaurant for two years, and if you're still into it and want that accomplishment of getting a degree, go for it. Just be prepared to work hard, for little money and it will take you decades to pay off school.

If I took one of my two days off to meal prep, I would eat at home more. But all I want to do on my days off is stay far far away from the kitchen. I think too because I am the only one who cooks, its just lonely in the kitchen, so if I had someone with me, helping chop stuff and wash up, I would do it more. My kids DO know how to cook for themselves, they eat a lot of egg tacos and doctored up ramen with kale, greens, hb eggs, and various meats.

They played at the Santa Barbara bowl, my BFF surprised me with tickets and we went. This was, 2015?

It was the last date on their tour and it was so... Awful. When they played I Will Do Anything For You, I sang harder than they did. It was so fucking underwhelming and disappointing. I also understand the feeling of the last show on a long tour. 

Another time, I saw The 1975s in Denver, 2018?, after binging their albums for a year. Again, the show was so sad. I knew at the time Matty was dealing with drug use. It was just... Meh, no love, not The 1975s I loved. Each song sounded like a pain in the ass for the band, lots of 'intermission' music between the songs they performed. Left annoyed I drove an hour to the show, paid for child care and bought drinks at the venue for that lackluster performance.

I'd see them both again if it was the 3rd or 4th show on a tour.

Edit to add after reading through comments of ppl who have seen bands who have lost a member.

I saw Sublime at the Ventura Concert Theater (Feb/March 1996?) that show was fucking epic as hell. Played all the songs, did 2? encores, didn't start late, the pit was live the whole time and Brad sang his heart out. Fucking tragic he overdoses a few months later. :("
