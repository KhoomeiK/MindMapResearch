k12sysadmin,fewroa6,t1_fet3t2n,1579418482.0,"I hate the usb c docks the cabling on the usb cord is too thick and puts an inordinate amount of tension on the port of it isn’t lined up just right. The ports at least on the Dells we use are not built well and we have had to call dell support to swap out multiple mother boards. 

One way that we have alleviated the problem has been by using the magnetic attachments so it doesn’t put much strain on the ports. 

I do not have any experience with other brands usb c docks maybe they figured it out better than Dell."
todayilearned,felnmwi,t1_felddc8,1579226497.0,Ya except if you get one thing slightly off and they just explode on you or don’t agree with your description. For fun you should buy a dollar or two stamp on eBay then repost it with an inaccurate description and watch the world burn.

Most examples have margins either just clear or touching, or into the design. The relative paucity of large multiples in sound condition also contributes to its scarcity with such wide margins.”

They get quite snarky sometimes. It’s been to long for me to recall the best but you can browse around and read. https://siegelauctions.com/ is one decent stamp auction house."

videos,fcj90rp,t1_fciq2z0,1577680285.0,That’s a good point I think? I have no clue if that’s an easy track or not. But if what you say is true then yes I absolutely agree with you.
