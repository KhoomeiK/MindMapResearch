drums,ffgk0mj,t1_ffgjvqr,1579908006.0,Ah gotcha. In the same boat I'd say. I think I found my perfect niche with Meinl and their different lines so I'll just build up on that while making my bank account weep in the background
drums,ffgjs3d,t1_ffgjcvl,1579907850.0,"Not too familiar with their 2020 stuff yet. Trying to NOT browse too much so I can appreciate the China and new Matt Halpern snare since I've only had those for 2 months and a week respectively lol

What are they doing this year?"
todayilearned,ffgjexm,t1_ffgirw7,1579907612.0,"u/capman511 you may now kiss the u/Umbongo_congo   


I'm so happy for you two!"
drums,ffgj8xp,t1_ffgiw2k,1579907502.0,"Oh 100%! Some of my Sabian and Paiste stan drummer buddies said I would regret it when I made the switch and tried to get me to go with their brand since Meinl is just a ""Youtube fad, they'll die soon!"" Now they drool over the new shinies I get and beg to borrow any extras I may have lying around ahaha"
Drumming,ffghi21,t1_ffgekn7,1579906348.0,Sounds better than it looks believe it or not! It's a toss up between that and my China for my favorite part of my kit
drums,ffge9i2,t1_ffgd4dk,1579904291.0,"Yea, the hats are next on my wishlist once I finally wear out these HCS ones and I have the extra cash for it. Will for sure need to do a little more research as well tho, I really like the sound of my custom dark ride and may want to extend on that sound a little bit.   


My guitarist is SUPER jealous of the variety that cymbals have and wished that the cool pedals he wants weren't more expensive than all his other gear put together lol"
drums,ffgaln4,t1_ffg5mz5,1579902036.0,Oh hell yea! Easily the most versatile cymbal on my kit and slowly becoming my favorite. My kit is twice as loud as this time last year between that and my Matt Halpern snare
Drumming,fffjvai,t1_fffim2e,1579885530.0,The HCS pack is the beginner set but they're super affordable and sound good for the price. I got the [Ultimate Box Set](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/HCS-SCS1--meinl-cymbals-ultimate-cymbal-box-set-with-free-16-inch-trash-crash?&mrkgcl=28&mrkgadid=3301332049&product_id=HCS-SCS1&campaigntype=shopping&campaign=aaShopping%2520-%2520SKU%2520-%2520Drums%2520%26%2520Percussion&adgroup=Cymbals%2520-%2520Meinl%2520Cymbals%2520-%2520hcs-scs1&placement=google&creative=280136033722&device=c&matchtype=&network=g&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuqK88duc5wIVVP_jBx06nQi7EAQYBiABEgJi7PD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) and it was a little over $400 after tax
Drumming,fffawiv,t1_fff0hx6,1579879921.0,"The really shiny ones are yup! The Meinl HCS beginner line, but all my cymbals are Meinl outside the bottom of the stack I have below my ride on the right.   


From top left to right:
