Nope, no edit.

New charge is in a different county. The new attorney went to that court date with me and didn't help get it thrown out or explain that it was their fault to begin with, because it would've made them look bad.

Thanks for the advice, official or otherwise :P I'd love to but getting them on the phone has been impossible. The last time I talked to him, it took over a week and 5 phone calls to their home office to get him on the phone for less than 5 minutes, where he rushed me off and said he'd call me back. Spoiler alert - he didn't.

I'll try to talk to the state / local Bar office if we have one and see if that gets me anywhere. It's been such a nightmare that at this point, I'm exhausted dealing with it. And all this over a fucking speeding ticket. It blows my mind how inherently dysfunctional the legal system is in this country, especially for the poor."

todayilearned,fe1t34s,t1_fe1ru4a,1578830560.0,"I already threatened a BAR complaint. All they did was apologize and give my case to another attorney at their firm. He's been better at communicating but still fucking things up. As of right now, I have a warrant out AGAIN because the ""pre-trial order didn't make it to the judge in time"". It's been that way since last Wednesday and I haven't even been able to go to the grocery store out of fear that I'll get arrested again.

So that's 2 license suspensions, 1 arrest and full night in jail, and a new charge of driving on a suspended license that I got ONLY because I got an attorney. I should've and could've represented myself for cheaper AND with a better outcome, but I thought I was doing the responsible thing since I was told by the prosecutor I could lose my license over it.

At this point I feel like I need to talk to a new attorney just to advise me on my current situation, but after paying them $300 I can't afford one. Oh, and this was the 2nd highest rated firm on Google in our city with over 200 reviews - clearly they were all legit and not purchased /s"

Good luck finding an attorney willing to take a case against another attorney or law firm. They know it'll be extremely hard fought and like many professions, they protect their own. If you did find one willing to take the case, the cost would be outrageous from how long another attorney could drag it out. The only thing you can realistically do is file a complaint with the state BAR, but you have no idea whether that will accomplish anything. If it does go anywhere, it'll likely be a slap on the wrist (like a censure) for all but the worst cases."
todayilearned,fe1mzhj,t1_fe1g9o6,1578828554.0,"Even hiring an attorney doesn't mean anything if they don't take you or your case seriously, as I've recently discovered. Paid $300 to get out of a heavy speeding ticket and get traffic school instead - the attorneys at the firm I hired ignore my messages and calls asking about my case, postpone indefinitely (almost a year now), and have missed 3 court dates on my behalf, causing me to get arrested out of nowhere because there was a warrant out for me I had no idea about, as well an extra charge for my license they'd gotten suspended. There's no real way to hold them accountable unless you're already wealthy and powerful, so why would they care once they have your money?"
