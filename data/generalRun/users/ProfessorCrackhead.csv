Removing and restaffing an entire branch of the federal government isn't feasible.

You can wail and gnash your teeth, but these government institutions aren't going anywhere, because the people that know things within these soon-to-be-defunct institutions (under your decision to start from scratch) aren't going anywhere.  

You can't even expect a full clean, because agents from one branch will leak over into others.  

Oh, you want to clean house completely, and only hire people with no previous experience with another agency?  Good luck training them and getting them ready in time to run these new agencies.  

Oh, your plan instead is to vet these people to make sure they aren't ""bad people""?  Yeah, I'm sure you'd be able to sniff out FUCKING FBI AND CIA agents, who are trained to do shit like this.  

All you're doing is disabling the good agents (and they do exist, don't let horror stories turn you against them) from doing their sworn duty.
