AnimalsBeingBros,ffeuh4f,t1_ffeu74o,1579866066.0,"Ah yes, now I see what you were getting at. Exactly what my original point was, Cesar and other old-fashioned/force-based trainers have morphed the concept in a dangerous way!"
AnimalsBeingBros,ffetuxr,t1_ffejmqm,1579865268.0,"It’s kinda funny you linked to her. Taking her class in undergrad was what got me into dog behavior in the first place and is who taught me that those traditional definitions were wrong (and the blog you linked I think says quite the opposite of what you’re trying to prove but it’s interesting we got different impressions). I actually immediately wondered what her thoughts on this would be. From what she’s taught me the old dog in the video would be the “dominant” dog here, and that wouldn’t fit with what Cesar teaches as my original comment argues. Maybe I’ll email her and ask or talk to her next time she drops by the vet school."
AnimalsBeingBros,ffdvt62,t1_ffdrkj0,1579830172.0,"I’m about to graduate vet school (found out yesterday I passed the NAVLE exam) and with my nearly 10 years of experience in working professionally in canine behavior and training, I also plan to do a residency in behavioral medicine to get DACVB certified. You are allowed to disagree but I’m not “some loser redditor” and I feel sorry for your dog."
AnimalsBeingBros,ffdvhul,t1_ffdsh9r,1579829950.0,Would you mind pointing me toward some relevant literature on the topic?
AnimalsBeingBros,ffdqmgf,t1_ffdpcjy,1579826584.0,"Then there’s dumbass people like Cesar convincing huge amounts of people these false ideas about hierarchy also apply to domestic dogs, leading to major public misunderstanding of canine behavior and some horrifying mishandling of how to manage it."

AbsoluteUnits,ff949kb,t1_ff92l4h,1579704480.0,Sugar free haribo gummy bear reviews still make me howl every time i read them.

cringepics,fetwpjh,t1_ferwnq5,1579380810.0,I’m convinced everyone thinks vanilla is “plain” cuz it’s white. If it were hot pink or something everyone would start respecting it for what it is - the best ice cream flavor ever.
rareinsults,fett56e,t1_fet5byl,1579379765.0,Right? It’s common sense. There are always so many people on these threads who assume everyone on the road is out to piss them off. There’s a lot more to the big picture than “drive the speed limit at a safe following distance” (which are arbitrary numbers anyway) when there are so many factors involved.
rareinsults,fets1nb,t1_fet825g,1579379323.0,Why did they slam on the brakes?
rareinsults,fetrr0a,t1_fet3lx7,1579379131.0,This happens to me a lot on my commute. There are stoplights at many intersections in a row. If you go 3-5 over the speed limit they are all timed to be green so yes i am going to try to get past people who are scared to be out on the roads and driving under the speed limit/exactly the same speed as the car next to them. Where I live people are constantly braking at green lights IN CASE it turns yellow. It makes me crazy.
rareinsults,fetr3xr,t1_fet2ed5,1579378663.0,"100% same experience i have. I always say Subaru cross trek drivers are just people who haven’t bought a Prius yet. The city i live in has sooo many of these two types of cars, when there’s a huge line of cars stuck going 5-10 under the speed limit it’s ALWAYS a Prius at the front. Always."
me_irl,feim0ja,t1_feih2dy,1579141671.0,"Same. I usually can pretty easily get past any transient anxiety by thinking of grand scheme type stuff, like that one popular gif where it’s like a girl laying in a field and it zooms out to the city, state, country, world, universe, galaxy, whatever. Like okay my problem is not a huge deal and it will pass. But also, turning 10 pages forward in a planner and realizing a year of my life can fit in 50ish pages makes me totally freak out."

Wellthatsucks,febyx3h,t1_feaizbv,1578964458.0,30 was fine. 31 made me feel old. Now I’m 32 and have to double check the math cuz I forget how old I am. A steep curve towards dementia apparently
funny,fe0cm24,t1_fdzt9v2,1578809887.0,"Reminds me of 4 years ago when the kicker missed the game winner to lose 10-9. I’m a packer fan but I get real empathetic with any kicker that goes through that, when I was pouting my roommate goes “if anyone gets mad at him he can just tell them he scored 100% of their points”."
WTF,fdunfoh,t1_fduh5lq,1578735774.0,Probably not. I think they’re annoying but funny so I’m only with you on 50%
CasualConversation,fdtvmyf,t1_fdta9qk,1578722941.0,"This reminds me of a convo I had with my ex boyfriends best friend... we would chat about girls and he’d ask for advice or whatever. And I went down the route of explaining how to play it cool and not be too forward to avoid appearing creepy. He was like, actually, that’s how I am and if a girl doesn’t like it then why would I wanna date her? 

That shit changed my life. Been encountering dating frustrations myself lately so thanks for the reminder."
WTF,fdtudcm,t1_fdtomnd,1578722348.0,Seriously I woulda put money on it. Thought I had finally caught one before it caught me
oddlysatisfying,fdqh4cb,t1_fdpulkf,1578666525.0,"I’ve been getting these facebook ads for a miraculous cleaning tool that sucks every morsel of dirt and dust out of the tiniest crevices in your car, it appears to be just a little version of these balls."
aww,fdpczob,t3_emh9ya,1578625512.0,I’m a vet student on clinics and this pic is a great summary of why I had to schedule a visit to see my chiropractor today.
aww,fdpcvjo,t1_fdp8v7j,1578625433.0,"Honestly now that you ask, the exam tables are probably the cleanest place in the entire clinic at any given time. Since it gets disinfected most often."
aww,fdpcrez,t1_fdp55bf,1578625354.0,Colors - yes. Everything else - no. Different shaped head!
HumansBeingBros,fdlrdtk,t1_fdlcegj,1578530684.0,"I have been a huge fan of the podcast for a long time and tried to hear his side of the story first before digging into why people were pissed. He advertised this interview with some guy where they spent the entire time essentially blaming “oversensitive snowflake” types and repeating typical right wing bullshit about why it’s everyone else’s fault. All he had to do was own up to what he said and back it up and it wouldn’t have been offensive. Going on the attack really rubbed me the wrong way, I expected better from him. Disappointing"
explainlikeimfive,fdllyxc,t1_fdlfg4d,1578527027.0,I want this on a t-shirt.
Wellthatsucks,fdjv137,t1_fdjn6xj,1578488422.0,I think this and all of the above would work. Op has only tried a bit of tap water on his finger so far lol
MurderedByWords,fdjtylb,t1_fdjs3fr,1578487399.0,"Yup. Everyone is mad about the height shaming when the entire point is that you can totally tell who is lying about their height and by how much, once you start talking to them."
MurderedByWords,fdjtnbg,t1_fdjrsk1,1578487089.0,"Do you say you’re 5’8” on dating apps? If you own it you won’t have much of an issue. If you are actually nice unlike the dude in the post you won’t have much of an issue. 
I would’ve said the exact same thing as she did. There’s an odd phenomenon of going out with insecure douchebags who say they’re 6 feet tall but end up being shorter than me. I’m 5’9”. Like, why would you lie if you’re planning to actually meet up? This has happened to me multiple times."
notliketheothergirls,fctyt2r,t1_fcky0by,1577966241.0,"This is why i get so annoyed at r/tinder’s obsession with hating on girls who specifically prefer tall men. I’m only 5’9” but have been since 4th grade. For 5-6+ years all the boys who were shorter than me thought I was huge and gross. It’s not that I don’t find shorter guys attractive ever, but I still feel really self conscious trying to date one."
starterpacks,fcsvsja,t1_fcsjxhk,1577926373.0,I always thought the salty snacks were to make people thirsty so they’d buy more to drink. And hangovers are presumably different at least for me because I tend to drink a lot more beer volume-wise and therefore pee more.
starterpacks,fcsacdm,t1_fcrbya6,1577913734.0,I always got real bad headache hangovers every time I drank more than a couple beers. About 5 months ago I started taking vitamin B12 intermittently and I haven’t had a beer headache since. I dunno how it works but it’s magic.
funny,fcapliq,t1_fcamrsu,1577574039.0,I decided way back when I discovered him on The Tudors that he is by far the most attractive man I’ve ever laid eyes on so am absolutely on board with this.

worldnews,fbx0t82,t1_fbwxyyk,1577165094.0,Check out the second or third episode of the Bill gates documentary on Netflix. This is one of the things he’s been working on and they present what seems to be a pretty good summary of both the benefits and challenges of nuclear energy.
