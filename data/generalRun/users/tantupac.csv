AskReddit,fffvl3t,t3_et8871,1579892753.0,If you're from central Indiana you should know the story of motorcycle road. Long story short the urban legend states the back in the 50s there was these high school sweethearts. The girls family hated that they were together so her father hung her boyfriend. Legend states that if you go to the road of the girls house and flash your head lights 3 times his spirit would start driving toward you and then vanish.
