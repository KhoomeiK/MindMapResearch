Hitler compared Jews to vermin to justify killing them, but the whole reason why that’s wrong is that Jews aren’t comparable to vermin, they’re people, so there’s no logical progression from killing vermin to killing Jews. But you know that already, and asked the question anyways, because you’re arguing in bad faith. I could ask you why you think gassing roaches is comparable to gassing Jews, but then I’d be arguing in bad faith and I don’t want to do that, so I just stopped arguing.

If you want an actual answer, the reason why I’m okay with gassing roaches but not gassing Jews is that Jews are people, and I am generally against killing people, as they have much more complex thoughts and emotions than roaches, who just want to eat the food from my fridge.
