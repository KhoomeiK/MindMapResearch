SGExams,fegxb6m,t3_ep41ab,1579104610.0,Hey I think putting ASJC even though your points is on the borderline of COP is still worth a shot. It all depends on the popularity of the school for this year. I'm kind of stuck in the same situation as you as I want to apply to TJC with 9 points as I don't live that far from it as compared to my other choices. However my points are also on the COP but I'm still willing to try anyway. All you can do is hope for the best. The rest is out of your power and you should try not to worry about it too much. :)
