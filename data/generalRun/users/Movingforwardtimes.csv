antiwork,ffgqahj,t3_etc66r,1579912329.0,Yes. And I’ve been off a job for a year now. I’m about to graduate and the constant pressures from parents to lead an unfulfilling life is suicide fuel on the daily basis. I can’t imagine living a life where i slave away just to achieve basic human necessities.
ForeverAlone,ffg85ym,t3_etc3z0,1579900539.0,I’ve never related to something more. This is accurate
SuicideWatch,ff7pacs,t1_ff6l6yz,1579655039.0,"Same, I’m 18 and have diabetes and kidney problems, as well as some other shit with my back. However I’m intentionally continuing my unhealthy lifestyle with the hope that I’ll die without having to do it myself. Preferably before 22"
ForeverAlone,ff63scx,t3_ernm5z,1579618415.0,Yes. All my life
ForeverAlone,ff62uus,t3_errvte,1579617741.0,It’s painful when they don’t even acknowledge you and you just feel like diving out the window to your demise so you won’t have to face the inadequacy which is you
MaladaptiveDreaming,ff5ytki,t3_ert5wj,1579614614.0,This is a little.... TOO accurate
antiwork,ff4694z,t1_ff3smab,1579556454.0,Couldn’t agree more. I’ve been hoping WW3 would happen because there’s no way a nuclear war of that magnitude wouldn’t wipe half the planet. Either WW3 or technological singularity. I feel we’re far from that though
antiwork,ff461x4,t1_ff3z0x3,1579556330.0,"Never thought of fishing as feasible, it might be suited for me since I’m really introverted. Any jobs that don’t require customer service or much interaction suit me best. Since I’m still in HS most of the jobs I want won’t hire me, and that sucks."
antiwork,ff3sed9,t3_ercvzn,1579547831.0,I’m having serious thoughts about killing my self as I graduate in 6months and know there’s no way I can mentally stand being wage slave for my entire life. Fuck this
ForeverAlone,ff3pl42,t1_ff1g1bt,1579546111.0,I’ve had thoughts about doing this recently. My social media hasn’t been worth noting for 2+ years. Only thing that keeps me up there is stalking my crushes
godtiersuperpowers,ff1oq51,t3_eqzsx1,1579482804.0,I’m unlucky enough to get the 31% every time
2meirl4meirl,fejpq93,t3_epepma,1579182674.0,"ALL the time, even when I’m intentionally trying to stop myself from doing so."
ForeverAlone,fehmf5y,t1_fegxpib,1579119504.0,I feel this way to. It’s almost like you cannot have any imperfections to live your desired life
ForeverAlone,fef5f87,t3_eou60o,1579048599.0,"I know how you feel, except my crush and I just glance at each other from time to time and I haven’t come close to developing a friendship. Idk if you and your crush are friends but if you are and she says this she MAY actually view you as a decent guy, but she’s just committed to her current relationship. If you really think she’s worth it stick by and actively try to be her friend and get closer to her(I know that’s hard) or you can move on and pretend she doesn’t exist."
socialanxiety,fe7fx53,t1_fe6rccp,1578914126.0,Not true.
KylieJenner,fe6an5w,t3_encmyw,1578885582.0,Sexiest shit ever
socialanxiety,fe64au6,t1_fe62j83,1578881473.0,"I guess I should try sitting around everyone instead of being secluded. I guess I don’t feel missed cause I haven’t seen them in years but there’s no telling, I guess I’ll never know if I don’t try. I just doubt it heavily."
depression,fe5ipa6,t1_fe3x3w5,1578869958.0,Underrated comment. They just aren’t real
Advice,fe3dnku,t1_fe38w5z,1578848364.0,"I have the tendency to heavily overthink the simplest things, I guess it couldn’t hurt."
LucidDreaming,fdp27sn,t3_emh8f7,1578618248.0,Play out perfect scenarios with my desired endings to them
sad,fdh5y14,t3_el4u8h,1578416085.0,Both
MaladaptiveDreaming,fdgznqa,t3_el8em2,1578412166.0,That’s about the only thing I can do...
ForeverAlone,fdgl1rg,t3_el5nyq,1578400908.0,"This has happened to me too. The girl herself wasn’t even pretty but I still pursued, yet I was the one who got ghosted. A1 advice is never send a pic FA guys, it’s just not guaranteed to end well"
ForeverAlone,fdeeadx,t1_fde90qk,1578337140.0,This was the best answer I’ve ever seen on the topic. True AF
