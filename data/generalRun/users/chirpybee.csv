Catholic,fe7d8qn,t3_enztk1,1578912969.0,"The absolute easiest missal to use is the Magnificat. You subscribe and receive a new one monthly. Has morning prayer, Mass prayers, and evening prayers, plus an art lesson and great blurbs about the saints. 

The Magnificat is the one you'll see most people use today. It's dated. I use a good ole post-it tab to stay on the right page. 

Most Catholic bookstores sell it issue-by-issue, so you can buy one and see if she likes. 

Mid-month, like now, you might be able to get an extra copy from the parish secretary.  Our parish secretary is great about hoarding a few unused copies for just such requests. 

https://bookstore.magnificat.net/

Also, call The Magnificat. Explain. Maybe they'll send you a sample copy to help you decide if you'd like to subscribe. 

As for a true missal, I like my Daily Roman Missal from Our Sunday Visitor. Daily Roman Missal

The daily Mass on EWTN is the easiest way for her to join in at home. 

Put her on her parish's list of shut-ins. They will send a priest periodically for Confession, and Eucharistic ministers more often so she can receive Holy Communion. 

You are a beautiful child, and she is blessed that you care and are trying to help her!"
