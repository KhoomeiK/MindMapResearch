deadbydaylight,ff7tq04,t1_ff7szhc,1579658135.0,"first of all, I don't mean only survivor perks should be buffed, killers as well. So it's also an overall buff to killers when you think about it. Also, it's gonna be dependent on how big the buffs are, they can be minor buffs. It doesn't have to be an extreme change."
deadbydaylight,ff7r46f,t3_es4ehn,1579656324.0,"honestly, they need to take power away from items and addons and shift some of that power to perks. Then maybe, we'll get a more varied set of perks used in this game.

LegendsOfRuneterra,ff7q3zu,t3_es204z,1579655621.0,"Maybe not whole entire regions, but it would be kinda interesting and actually fun, if we can ban cards. Maybe not for a whole season though. 

For example, every Saturday and Sunday, we can vote for 1 card to ban from the entire list on their LoR website. The top 5-10 cards with the highest votes will be banned for the following week, Monday-Sunday. Maybe have the voting have a requirement like minimum 5 or 10 ranked matches played the past week. It could be top 2 champions and the rest followers/spells, or just followers/spells for now since there's not too many Champions.

Pros:

1. This will keep the competitive playerbase engaged.
2. What a better way to see which cards are deemed overpowered when they are consistently banned.
3. Gives tons of content for content creators to make since lots of different decks will have to be brewed when core cards are banned.
4. It gives this card game something unique that sets it apart from other games, while having an extra connectability to League of Legends.

Cons:

1. People will actually have to change their decks once in a while to account for bans (could actually be a pro though xD)
2. Some cards will probably be banned very regularly. But that should tell the devs something!"
