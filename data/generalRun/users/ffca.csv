I'll miss you. Thanks for making basketball what it is today. You were bigger than life, and now you're gone. One day I will accept it. Until then, I will cherish my family a bit more, hug them a bit longer every day, because if it can happen to someone as invincible or indestructible as you, it can definitely happen to me. I didn't know you, but I'm heartbroken, man."

nba,ffs7aep,t3_euw4sr,1580174888.0," I've seen legends fade away and succumb to time or illness. I did not expect to feel this way about Kobe. It feels like a nightmare from which I cannot awake. A few hours pass, I forget and feel numb. Then a wave of realization hits me like a fever when I read or hear about Kobe again. This wasn't supposed to happen. I feel like I'm living in the wrong alternate reality. I am having a hard time making sense of this and my feelings. I didn't think I was a big Kobe fan."

I don't get it. I didn't know the guy. I wasn't obsessed with him when he played. But it feels like a friend died. I cried several times today watching different videos about his life and death. 

I was playing PUBG when my brother broke the news on discord. I felt it. I physically felt pain in my chest and stomach. I teared up, man. I can only imagine how his true fans feel. 

This world will miss Kobe. I felt like he had a lot to accomplish still. I don't have a real outlet to express these feelings about a basketball player I didn't know personally, so I wanted to express things here, even if no one reads this."
