cripplingalcoholism,fdab9tq,t1_fd5ugo8,1578244039.0,"Well that's a hard task to try and take on, full recovery from a night of drinking. A ketogenic diet would be useful as glutamine favours GABA conversion over glutamate on keto, in fact in  the 50's they put epileptic kids on a keto diet to prevent seizures. plus all of the nutrients on a diet that most people don't get with a SAD diet. which is full of refined grains/carbs. B- vits, magnesium, neurotransmitter pre-cursors , taurine could be useful, as glutamine could to too , and NAC as a precursor to Glutathione, which mops up acetaldehyde before it wrecks havoc on your brain.

Remember , pleasure isn't free and you cannot stop receptor downregulation which is part of homeostasis i said spoke in other post.   that's a hardware change you have no control over."
