My best friend is a military wife and I have met and spent time with many of her friends. I have seen how the mice play when the cat is away. Some women are committed, some are just not. It’s too easy (out of sight, out of mind). Where was she gone for 8 hours every day?? And not even a single gift? That’s low my friend. I hope you can get this all sorted quickly and be done with it.

I myself hate being around anyone smoking or who smell of smoke...so I’d struggle with it too if I’m being honest. I react badly to cigarette smoke so I could probably never be with a smoker.

My husband “apologizes” all the time after verbally abusing me. He says “I’m sorry you made me upset but you made me xyz” which is bullshit, obviously. He lacks empathy for my pain. 

Not saying any of this is happening but your vagueness puts these events on a continuum of a very mild disagreement to verbal/emo abuse and it’s unclear where this falls; and if it’s on a high end it’s no wonder your wife is shutting down. Taking her rings off and sleeping separately is a pretty big deal...so I suspect it’s much more than a simple misunderstanding.

Now I walk in the door and if I see the piles folded I ask “what time is the parade starting?” He’s got a good sense of humour about the laundry now so it’s become a running joke, but continues to peacock whenever he does a thing.

Besides...having having too many common interests and crossover can lead to strong opinions or hard feelings if someone outshines another; or feel like someone ‘trying too hard’, etc. The few times my mate tried to show interest in something I liked I knew it was disingenuous and he was only doing it for my benefit anyway.

relationships,fejrban,t1_fejq3eq,1579183896.0,"You’re exactly right. It’s a very unhealthy place to live right now; I am just worried that the shock/stress/anxiety after the split will be so much worse than the slow trickle of unhappiness I live right now. I have largely concluded he’s just not sure how to be a healthy adult with loving behaviour and happens to have some abusive tendencies. He’s not full out verbally attacking daily; but no matter, I think the damage is done. I don’t feel safe with him physically. Not because I’m afraid he will ever hit or hurt me but my body reacts very strongly to him when I’m feeling self protective. Maybe that sounds a bit weird and probably warrants some exploration too. 
I have an appointment this afternoon with a good practical family counselor to look at options. I don’t know if you saw also; but he’s ADHD as well which makes it difficult for him to stick with anything long term. And the fact that it takes consistent, pointed effort for someone to not be abusive just doesn’t sit right with me. If you have to work at not being that way, I’m not sure I can live with that. For the same reasons people may opt not to get involve with former drug addicts or recovering alcoholics."

relationships,fejpphs,t3_epiut1,1579182657.0,"100% this is not going to peter out. It will only escalate as long as you and her bf enable this to continue. Where there’s smoke there’s fire. Everybody insists up and down they’ll never cheat because logic and reason says “no way!” but then one day the neurochemical train will pull into the station and logic and reason go riiiight our the window. It’s like a drug. It will hijack the best intentioned of brains. Please approach this with code red-level caution. 
Also I’m reading your post and thinking; they have the perfect alibi. It’s too easy."

I wouldn’t be putting it to the test. There are other bands out there he can join..."

relationships,fehea7h,t1_feh212k,1579114760.0,"you know as I was reading this I thought you were a woman in the first half and thought  - hey good for you girlfriend, look at you go flipping it on it’s head - and then I saw wife. Why is it never this way for women? I was hopeful for a second. To add; so would I. I’d love the ability to have the physicality and mentality of being able to do that and maybe a little bit out of spite. I think women are just so tired of being glorified containers already. 
Good for you, buddy: “make sure she gets hers”. Tell a friend."
