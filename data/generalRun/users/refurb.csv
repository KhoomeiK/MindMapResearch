Landlord,fdahehw,t3_ekfee0,1578246159.0,"Was a landlord in SF.

Keep in mind that SF has some of the most tenant-friendly laws in the US.

You can only evict tenants for “just cause” reasons (not paying rent, etc).  You can also evict if you want to do an owner move-in or take the unit entirely off the market.

In your case (owner move-in), you will need a lawyer to do it right.  If you don’t do it right, the rent board will make you do it all over again.

Keep in mind that if the tenant is elderly, disabled or has school-aged children, you may have to take additional time to evict them.

The biggest issue will be the buy-out.  With owner move-in you need to pay the tenant a set amount of money, depending on how long they’ve been there.  It can range from $5,000 to over $100,000.

Again, get an experienced lawyer as any mistake you make will result in having to start all over again.

SF does not like landlords in the least."
