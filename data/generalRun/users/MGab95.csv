WomensHealth,ffhh0ql,t3_etkxkx,1579934868.0,"Sometimes having sex for the first time is hard and stuff goes wrong. The first time I tried having sex, we couldn't get there. 2nd time? Nope. Lot's can go wrong and it's fairly normal. For me, first attempts either hurt, I couldn't stay wet, or he had nerves and couldn't stay hard. Stuff like that. Sex takes practice, so dont worry too much. 

Now, I think most people covered this already but I'll recap some potential causes:

1) The most likely and harmless reason is being nervous. Being nervous can make you contract your muscles, which can make everything ""tight,"" making penetration difficult and potentially causing pain. 

2) Another possibility is vaginismus like some people have said. That condition causes your vagina to contract and spasm regardless of your mood, arousal or mental state. I'd only worry about having this if this happens again a couple of times or if stuff like tampons or your own fingers hurt.

3) Then there's hymen issues. Some people have hymens with very small openings. You can check with your fingers. If tampons or fingers can go in easily, your hymen probably isn't causing any issue. It's worth checking though!"

If you have trouble finding time to take long breaks (back to back classes, etc), the food and hydration part is super extra important.

cheatatmathhomework,fdcy8i0,t3_eknenl,1578287862.0,"(x-y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 -2xy

Solve for xy:

(x-y)^2 - x^2 - y^2 = -2xy


-[(x-y)^2 - x^2 - y^2 ] / 2= xy.

Now, use the given values. I'll do your first one where x^2 + y^2 = 4 and x-y = sqrt(6):

-[(x-y)^2 - x^2 - y^2 ] / 2= xy is the same as

-[(x-y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2 )] / 2= xy

And since x-y=sqrt(6) and x^2 + y^2 = 4, we get

-[6-4]/2 = xy

-[2]/2 = xy

-1 = xy

Edit: formatting

Note: the first formula is where the 2 comes from. You can prove it by foiling everything out.
 (x-y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy and (x-y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy are considered fairly standard ""formulas"""
