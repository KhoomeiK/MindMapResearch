asktransgender,fffb3cy,t3_et8t9m,1579880042.0,"I'm pretty sure it's mostly due to people being ""lazy"" and wanting to get their point across the fastest possible way. Look at all the acronyms in internet slang: lol, smh, lmao, brb, etc. Those don't exist by accident. If someone says trans___ to someone else who isn't exposed to LGBT culture frequently, that person might get confused and misremember what that's supposed to indicate. However, MTF/FTM is a simple acronym that's both shorter than saying trans___ and gives a clearer explaination of a trans person's situation.

In addition, there is also the fact that trans___ gives the sense that the trans person has fully transitioned by this point; they've met their goal so to speak. As you might imagine, this can add on additional confusion. ""Male to female"" and ""Female to male"" explains that the journey is still in motion. If at some point later, someone feels comfortable with their point in transitioning to bear the title of ""trans___"", then power to them.

Anyway, this has mostly been my attempt at explaining why MTF/FTM is so prevalent from my own understanding."

Pathfinder_RPG,fdmb91c,t3_elufzy,1578544524.0,"As someone who played a former dressmaker character with Craft Wondrous Items, the way I roleplayed it is that gold is used as a fundamental part of the process, which is why many valuable/magical items have gold components and embellishments. Or, the gold is directly weaved into the fabric, and gives the final object a shiny look to it. 

You'd still need some non-gold items to use the gold on, but they're overall fairly inexpensive.

So why is gold used? It's how the objects retain whatever magic you want them to have, like how modern day circuit boards work.

I'd imagine that anyone who never planned on buying or crafting a magic item could get away with counterfeiting, but once you bring that gold to the local wizard to get a nice belt crafted by them, they'd figure out that the amount of gold present is not sufficient for whatever item you wanted.

In short, if your world has item crafters aplenty, then counterfeit gold would get caught really quickly, and loses much of it's value. It'd be a waste of time for counterfeiters, and likely too risky if they got caught."

While my apartment is fairly quiet, I still hear things like the hum of the lights and fridge. When I'm just relaxing and watching YouTube or playing games on my laptop for example, they really help let me completely ""zone"" into whatever I'm doing.

Since I know everyone is different, I won't randomly suggest things that might not apply to you. However, you might want to look up https://www.fdmt.ca/ It can at least give you some ideas of what resources already exist in the market, even if they don't ship to your country. Some things that they offer are expensive, like weighted blankets or pressure vests, but that ultimately depends on if you think you need those things. It took me awhile to realize that having weight and pressure on my body helps keep me calm, and the blanket has really helped with my sleep, but again, that's just me. (You don't need a prescription for any of their products, but similar to the earplugs, it'd likely help reduce the costs).

There's a very good chance that your country has its own store that offers whatever you're looking for, so a bit of research on that will probably help you save on money."
needadvice,fel7w5l,t1_fel4fgf,1579215971.0,"Related, look into ""musician's earplugs"".

My brother (high functioning autism) and myself (possible but undiagnosed autism) both use them while in loud locations. They help to cut out ""unnecessary"" sounds and reverberations, if I had to describe it.

I know that at least here in Canada, you can get the cost of them mostly covered if your doctor verifies that you need them due to medical reasons. My brother started wearing them fairly young (around ten years old I think) and due to that he had to get new ones every year as his ears would grow. It was only when I moved to a big, loud, city when I was in my early twenties that I decided to start using one of my brother's old pairs. I haven't felt the need to get my own as my ears haven't changed much shape since I started wearing them, so it's possible you wouldn't need to get them more than once at your age."

Pathfinder_RPG,fdmb91c,t3_elufzy,1578544524.0,"As someone who played a former dressmaker character with Craft Wondrous Items, the way I roleplayed it is that gold is used as a fundamental part of the process, which is why many valuable/magical items have gold components and embellishments. Or, the gold is directly weaved into the fabric, and gives the final object a shiny look to it. 

You'd still need some non-gold items to use the gold on, but they're overall fairly inexpensive.

So why is gold used? It's how the objects retain whatever magic you want them to have, like how modern day circuit boards work.

I'd imagine that anyone who never planned on buying or crafting a magic item could get away with counterfeiting, but once you bring that gold to the local wizard to get a nice belt crafted by them, they'd figure out that the amount of gold present is not sufficient for whatever item you wanted.

In short, if your world has item crafters aplenty, then counterfeit gold would get caught really quickly, and loses much of it's value. It'd be a waste of time for counterfeiters, and likely too risky if they got caught."

C: Granted, discoveries are a bit rarer now compared to way back when.

A: I think the biggest thing is that our interest in tulpamancy practices have waned. We've learned most, if not all of what we wanted to learn.

C: We can still improve on certain things, like for example, Aru recently started taking a new medication that has made me a bit more inactive during the day. We've been slowly working on retraining ourselves to be more involved in passive forcing as a result. We'd still *like* to have more shared lucid dreams, but we've already had a few by this point."
