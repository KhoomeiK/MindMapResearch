Think of it this way: If she had gotten in a skiing accident and broken both legs, she wouldn't be able to take care you but she would still want to.  But instead of broken legs she has depression, which is like breaking both legs AND hitting her head, and now she can't remember what she's supposed to be doing for you.

Having depression is not like being sad for a little while; people with depression need to see a doctor for help in order to get better.  You need to talk to people in your family (aunts, uncles?) to find someone who understands the problem and will help your mom get to a doctor.

If you can't find someone in your family who can help, talk to a teacher (or guidance counselor)at school. They will find a way to help.

Just remember that it's not your responsibility to try to cheer her up or anything like that; she's got a medical condition that needs to be treated by a doctor.  And there are people in your life who will help y'all get a doctor for her: family members, teachers, even the parents of one of your friends if you feel comfortable talking to them."

The judicial officer is talking about the charges listed on the warrant; most likely no prosecutor has been involved yet.

If you go to court for a bond hearing, the judge says ""what are your charges?"" If my probation officer hears that I was arrested yesterday, he says ""looks like HelloKitty1939 picked up some new charges.""

My top theory is that there were 4 kids in the car. (I think OP admits that in a comment.) The weed was OP's, because it was his car.  but no one would claim it, so the cops just charged the driver.  Now OP's trying to figure out how to help his friend without actually taking responsibility.

Edit: I'm not sure why the tow truck driver called the cops.  Because the kids said there was a hit-and-run? If they wanted the cops called, they could have called on the same phone they used to call the tow truck.  The probably didn't want the cops called because they had weed in the car, but I don't know why the tow truck driver would care if the police were notified.  I bet there's some facts missing there too. :-)"

Also, when my nephew (who I helped raise) started eating food in a high chair, I would take all his clothes off to feed him.  Bibs reduce the amount of food that gets on their clothes but they get dirty no matter what.  When he was done eating I'd just wipe him off and put his clothes back on.  Less laundry to do!
