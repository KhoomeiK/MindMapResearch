Predators,fdel4xj,t1_fdeknuk,1578341339.0,My thinking was we need to jumpstart our offense and the defensemen we have called up have played well enough to allow Josi to try. If we had better production by our top six I wouldn’t even think about this.
Predators,fdejcb0,t1_fdefq89,1578340252.0,"This would be the ideal solution. I think they mentioned last night that our top two lines have like 8 goals since thanksgiving or something like that. It’s been evident, we just seem to be chasing the puck whenever they are on the ice."
Predators,fde4nbb,t1_fde3vfs,1578331085.0,"I actually wasn’t aware of that. Since I started really paying attention to hockey he’s always been one of San Jose’s defensemen. 

I’m sure most people think I’m a moron for suggesting the switch but from what I’ve seen this season Josi has outplayed our top 6 consistently and I’d like to see what he could do free from the duties of a d-man. It would take a solid string of games for Roman to pass Carlson for the Norris so I thought it was worth a shot."
Predators,fde02n6,t1_fdd5wai,1578328113.0,I just remember Burns playing as a forward for San Jose a few years back and I think Josi is even more talented offensively than Brent is. Josi plays half the night pushing the puck deep and having someone else cover his position so I didn’t think it would be that much of a stretch. Plus we could have three good d-men on the ice if we need to shut down another teams top line.

Predators,fdd2jyk,t1_fdd1vpn,1578292216.0,"It's not like he's some stoic defenseman who plays good d but isn't super talented skating or shooting (like hamhuis). Josi routinely skates around defenses better than half of our forwards, he spends a ton of time near and behind other teams nets and runs plays like a center. I just see him doing things I'd expect from Duchene or Forsberg and I wish he was free to play even more aggressively without having to worry about rushing back and playing defense if we lose possession."

Predators,fdd1pbc,t1_fdd1hya,1578291290.0,He outskates other forwards every game and is our points leader. With the way he takes pucks deep into other teams zones and sets up passes/scores goals I don't think it would be too much of a stretch for him to switch positions.
