dating_advice,ff8a7nn,t3_es78mh,1579670645.0,Personally I'd be understanding in a situation like that but only if it was communicated before hand. I understand anxiety and stuff mines used to be debilitating so if I was in love I'd live with the situation best I could
relationships,ff7y71t,t3_es4zx6,1579661175.0,Might be time to walk away my dude
depression,ff73at4,t3_es0rx8,1579640269.0,Same. 100% the same
depression,ff2l7dg,t3_eraqhs,1579511343.0,I'm very thankful my best friend is an understanding dude but it took alot of work and patience to get there. I think communicating with you friend might lay the ground work for some understanding
dating_advice,ff2j170,t3_erabcx,1579508320.0,"For me personally feeling wanted is a powerful force. Granted I think those of us that enjoy 
clingy have been unloved or never loved properly so feeling wanted is powerful as hell.

All in all depends on the person tbh..."
bipolar,fexh25h,t3_eqr6ui,1579430878.0,Damn solid advice
dating_advice,fex8a3e,t3_eqtyp9,1579426716.0,Yeah I feel ya. Just keep an open mind though. Never know who'll show up in your path.
offmychest,fex7unt,t3_equ2f1,1579426439.0,Listen you got this I believe In you
offmychest,fex0udi,t3_eqtaen,1579422489.0,I feel like running through a wall after reading that. I believe in you my dude
dating,fex0c0r,t3_eqtd1l,1579422252.0,"Old archaic social norms. ""The man must take charge and lead"" there's nothing wrong with a woman going after what she wants and I hope the next few generations absorb that. 

That said women do get rejected it just doesn't look like what'd you expect. Men often give the cold shoulder and outright ignore any that approach them. Not even a hard no most of the time. I've seen more than a few of my female friends go through that  weird limbo state."
relationship_advice,fewyxxv,t3_eqtgb4,1579421634.0,This has to be a troll. She's investing in her education....yeah the cooking part seals it 100% troll post
bipolar,fewxzcy,t3_eqtkah,1579421220.0,I'm so sorry to hear that :( such a hideously selfish man.
bipolar,fewvvd5,t3_eqt8al,1579420301.0,"Yeah but I saw a speech therapist as a kid so there might be a preexisting element for me. 

Lamictal def still gives me some issues in terms of brain fogginess but it's getting better. Only when I get really excited I start spitting word soup."

relationship_advice,fes9qd0,t1_fes8y0h,1579362980.0,This. If that's the case they probably see women as conquests
relationship_advice,fes8nhg,t3_eqhweb,1579362599.0,I'm not sure there's anyway to restore your peace of mind sadly. Multiple transgressions is hard to just forget no matter how hard you try.
offmychest,fere1d1,t3_eq84d7,1579352784.0,This is adorable
relationship_advice,ferbfzo,t3_eqfypx,1579352021.0,"I'm not sure what terms she's on with her current boyfriend but this is basically emotional cheating or she's using you as a place holder guy. Rough spot either way. Turning her attention to you after her bf leaves is kind of callous and maybe make yourself a little less available. You shouldn't be watching emotional movies with someone who's basically an ex to you when they're currently dating someone.


Also.... keep in mind even if you do win this ""tug of war"" with her ex who's to say she doesn't do the same thing with the roles reversed. When you're not looking she's buddying up with the ex."
AmItheAsshole,fenqv7s,t3_eq4z0p,1579289509.0,So.... it's understandable to have a preference no issue there... but feeling the need to add a disclaimer is weird... Cant you just bypass the people outside your preference...Isnt that better/less headache than having people confronting? And on top that you may be off putting to people within your preference group with that disclaimer. I'm not understanding what's gained by adding such a tag line.
depression,fen7z0l,t3_eq2klf,1579278958.0,For me personally I'm very much a take care of a Family member/Friend/SO type of person. So I  think I would try to uplift them without taking care of myself and it would end in disaster lol. You never know though I have yet to be in that situation.

offmychest,fegejne,t1_fegeddz,1579090012.0,You're right
offmychest,fegdk7b,t3_ep181v,1579088899.0,Well at least it's a good excuse to self evaluate lol. But I know what you mean from a certain extent I just started the show myself and it's got me thinking.
relationship_advice,fegcsgs,t3_ep0xx8,1579087973.0,"Him being unsure about what he's feeling and him ""not knowing how"" to repair the situation might mean it's ultimatum time either make a real effort to fix it or risk losing you. 

The result may or may not hurt but don't leave yourself in a holding pattern until this thing blows up cause from what I've seen/experienced in situations like this it usually does."
bipolar,fedrdzq,t3_eolyf8,1579018255.0,Absolutely. You'd think the lows would be the most obvious feeling but it's actually the highs that sets off alarm bells in my head in my experience.
relationship_advice,fedk4g0,t3_eom1ye,1579013538.0,You can't and honestly would you even want to force something so inorganic? Just live and see where life takes you.
offmychest,fecycpc,t3_eoic73,1578989697.0,I feel ya man. I've put up so many walls thanks to the past that communicate with me takes an act of god sometimes. It's heavy on the mind
bipolar,fecy3pa,t3_eohxk4,1578989355.0,"I think one of the most important things is now that you know try not to sinking into depression from the diagnosis it's self. That's the hardest part for me I'm still trying to process how it'll affect my relationships and work etc now that I know.

But you seem on top of it by researching these things"
depression,fecxlof,t3_eofgoa,1578988727.0,No... And probably never will be. I'm trying to learn to live with it.
relationship_advice,fe1u3q5,t3_enmgmv,1578830852.0,This is uhhhhh... something you should seek help over
relationship_advice,fdvg2q8,t3_en6yvh,1578747096.0,This is not healthy behavior you should end that relationship asap but also inform any friends and family of hers before you do it. Make sure the people in her life are aware of when in the event that she needs to be committed post break up.
offmychest,fdq0s9l,t3_emoiuf,1578649190.0,Lol 2 and a half here

bipolar,fdi2zg4,t1_fdi1cma,1578434807.0,"Wow that means alot to hear. I know it's never something that'll be ""cured"" but getting actual treatment as opposed to just existing also give me some peace of mind"
bipolar,fdhz34f,t1_fdhxkdr,1578432781.0,Diagnosed about 6 or 8 months ago and that's counting times adjusting meds etc. I've gotten better over time but every new relationship or friendship I have to explain my current journey.
bipolar,fdhw62i,t3_elhoym,1578431242.0,Absolutely wow. I've been thinking about this exact thing lately. People seeing me joking or play video games and think I'm acting weird for some sympathy every now and then
dating_advice,fddkh8y,t1_fddk4fg,1578315773.0,Thank you. I'm not so much in a rush to ask her out or anything at this point but you're absolutely right about considering the awkwardness factor.

relationships,fdczafc,t3_ekoao2,1578288819.0,"As a guy I can say men will do or say anything to get laid (even more so young guys). I think saying ""choose better"" is unproductive here. I think it's more of an issue of waiting a little longer sometimes until they stop glimmering and you start to see some cracks in their persona and maybe even asking for their intentions.

It's one thing if a person dates and decides the relationship shouldn't happen or won't work after trying but to say ""not exclusive"" is a selfish way of saying let me explore my options but keep me from being lonely."
relationship_advice,fdcm2l3,t3_ekiojz,1578278283.0,Just take a deep breath and step back. This worrying is going to not only going to affect your relationship but extract a mental toll on yourself. I think the best thing to consider might be investing in a hobby or goal to eat time while he does other things. Making one person your entire world is a heavy burden even more so at the rate the relationship could be progressing.
relationship_advice,fd8xx7a,t1_faws1hw,1578225126.0,This was an intense read...but true..
relationship_advice,fd482y9,t3_ek0jkl,1578165243.0,Huge red flags.
relationship_advice,fd1xnln,t1_fd1jg6u,1578138430.0,The cycle of life sadly
bipolar,fd026c4,t3_eivqml,1578112539.0,I take it too and don't really have that problem. For me it's mostly my mood is stabilized so I don't really think about it as much as I used too.
love,fcvdwpo,t1_fckh5gg,1578000065.0,I'm actually curious about this as well. If you're playing a game that's fairly laid back it'd be easier to maximize your time together.
love,fcvchep,t3_ehlh2q,1577999210.0,This pretty much sounds like mutual affection. Only things you really need line up is the visit. That and absolutely try to facetime before hand if you haven't mostly for safety.
relationship_advice,fcojuka,t3_ei9f10,1577834044.0,Recipe for disaster trust me. Move on
relationship_advice,fck17df,t3_ehie8z,1577713423.0,"I'm in somewhat the same boat friend. Personally the biggest things that worry me is never having lived with a SO and finances. I have my low moments but I feel like a good way to close the gap is doing activities you enjoy that also have a social component. You may meet someone you never know.

I think for people in our age group it's an awkward age for dating since you're out of college so you don't come across many younger women but also dating someone older can be stressful in the sense that they have their kid or racing against the clock to settle down having a career etc."
relationship_advice,fck0dxi,t3_ehe6z8,1577712618.0,"Sometimes sex can carry alot of weight especially if you love someone. You want your partner to feel satisfied there's an emotional component level of energy and willingness in that moment etc. Easier to just seek alone times sometimes. 

Therapy is the best course of action but make sure your SO is involved with the healing even if it's from a distance. I've had friends grow to resent their partner over time over stuff like this."
love,fc80wjv,t3_egolfj,1577523920.0,Yeah I get this alot too. To me it's one of those things where maybe its true but I feel like some of us are just doomed to being alone or being in an unhappy or unfulfilled relationship. Either way the idea makes me sad because the older you get the less time you have to spend with that special someone and make memories.
relationships,fc044lp,t3_effxqs,1577277660.0,This is pretty tragic however doing this on Christmas. Kind of a dick move. Also putting a counter on the days left is weird don't let him do that to you. He's essentially tainting ruining 2 holiday's for you.
relationship_advice,fc02g21,t3_effjzx,1577275173.0,If you do end up leaving just make sure you lay the ground work for your own safety. That ridiculous behavior could possibly lead to a dangerous situation for you.
relationship_advice,fc029hd,t3_eeln9n,1577274884.0,"Tbh this is a fixable issue. Now IF he started becoming indignant or shooting you down in other aspects of life like your approach on raising kids education work cooking etc...then you might have an issue. 

There's a way to approach your partner without making them feel stupid or mocking them. I find that's often an issue with very intelligent logical people their empathy switch gets flipped off when it comes to problem solving or someone having a differing stance or opinion."

relationship_advice,fbzwwvi,t3_efdx4z,1577266063.0,"She could simply be overwhelmed. Her reaction sounds weird but if she's having doubts or any guilt she may not know how to process all of this or the relationship as a whole.

Take a hard stance and communicate about it. You have to anyway considering your travel arrangements. Can't let her internal struggle dictate what happens to your vacation investment."
offmychest,fbzwoun,t3_efefeo,1577265699.0,As hard as it may be the best remedy I've found is to try not to people watch so much. I still haven't fully figured this type of thing myself but sometimes you just have to work on your own timeline and not concern yourself too much with the world around you.
relationship_advice,fbzwhxv,t3_efe3fe,1577265387.0,Why is guy 2 even in the picture? Can he not be avoided? Does he work with them? If he's bringing negative energy why is anyone having contact with him at all.
relationship_advice,fbyru75,t3_ef78sm,1577224643.0,This is...odd
relationship_advice,fby15mc,t3_ef3mo2,1577205591.0,Would be unfortunate if he started bragging to family about you.
relationship_advice,fbxehqa,t3_eez8ac,1577183138.0,I've had my snap chat glitch out like that before and I was simply in my home cooking. You should confront her about it but don't be super combative from the start. It would be bold of any cheater to let their phone continue to ping their location like that after your joking but some people are just that irreverent.
relationships,fbwy652,t3_eevze8,1577162682.0,"I would assume compared to her previous relationship she's possibly more flexible in terms of having a career an ability to move etc. It's all about when you can both set a time table to join households. 

The main issue I see here is being only 5 months in is a tad early to be making these plans including the idea of taking a job in her area. Take time to really feel out those moments when you visit as well. You really need to have a first hand understanding of how they live and deal with daily tasks and free time before either of you make such a large investment."
relationship_advice,fbwwu9e,t3_eew03k,1577161581.0,He could be attracted but can't read the situation very well. Not saying you have to carry the relationship but you might have to jump start it.
relationships,fbv60c7,t3_eeofyb,1577126072.0,Sounds like he's become somewhat complacent
relationship_advice,fbps5xb,t3_ee5a87,1577024477.0,Just take a deep breathe maybe go for a walk. It's going to sting for a little while but life will go on.
