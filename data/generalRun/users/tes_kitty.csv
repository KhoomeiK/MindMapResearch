gadgets,fepqigx,t1_feoyds6,1579327906.0,"Oh, you will still need different chargers. Your phone wants 5V @ a few amps and you want the thing to be small to be easy to carry (That's why I like the european 5V/1A charger from Apple, fits neatly into any pocket). Your notebook needs a lot more power and will therefore require a beefier (60W or more), much larger charger even if they both use USB-C."
amiga,feo4z96,t1_feo45e6,1579295176.0,Would need the circuit diagram for the monitor to check that.
amiga,feo25ym,t1_feo1jf6,1579294135.0,Maybe take your amiga with you so you can demonstrate the problem. A good tech should be able to get ideas about where to look when they see it in person.
amiga,fenzu3l,t1_fenfu5b,1579293152.0,"The flyback transformer will cause different issues (picture goes away, then returns, usually) if there are broken solder joints, but you should check out the solder joints at the SCART connector.

Careful, a CRT monitor has high voltages inside, the picture tube itself runs with at least 20000V (that's not a typo) and keeps a charge for a while after turning off the monitor. You might want to turn it off, disconnect it from the power line and wait for a few days. See if you can find some youtube videos about repairing a CRT monitor if you haven't done it before."
amiga,fenf5ps,t3_eq3gon,1579283364.0,"The monitor has a few push buttons. What are they set to?

A rolling image can be caused by a missing sync signal, VSYNC usually. Check your cable and also, if you can, the SCART connector on the monitor. My 1084 had broken solder joints on the flyback transformer and the SCART connector, causing all kinds of issues. I fixed them and the monitor has been running without issue ever since."

That was at a time when the HDs used a stepper motor to position the head assembly. Those were inaccurate enough that there was a chance they didn't quite delete the while track but were off a bit to the side. That was when HDs were below 100 MB in size.

Anything beyond that was a rumor."

Doesn't matter for drives that were made in the last 15 years or longer. Once the data has been overwritten ONCE, it's gone. We're no longer using 20 MB drives with stepper motor head positioning."
politics,femlnxm,t1_feldgah,1579261616.0,"Uhm, no. When you make an image of a drive for an investigation, it's a complete image and contains every single sector, doesn't matter if it's used or free. That way you can recover data that was deleted using the OS (meaning sectors were marked as 'free' again, but not overwritten). But if the data was actually overwritten, there is no way to recover it even if you had the actual drive in your posession."
worldnews,fek7lnd,t1_fek4276,1579194280.0,"It's not the voltage that will kill you, it's the current. A few mA that pass through your heart (from the left hand to a foot for example) can be fatal. Most of the time 110V won't kill you, but there are some people each year that still manage it.

I prefer 230V (no longer 220), means I only need one type of outlet in the house. Dishwasher, Washer and Dryer will run just fine on a 230V/16A circuit each."

The Apple chargers are of high quality (power and current regulation) and I personally have no problems with the cables while others do, I wonder if it has to do with skin oils. My fix for them is some heat shrink tubing for the affected area. Needs to be done as soon as the cable shows signs of wear."
