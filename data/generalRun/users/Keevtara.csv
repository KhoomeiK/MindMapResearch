Physically, I’m just a tad bit overweight, but I have trouble focusing on anything that doesn’t interest me. Like, I need my Adderall to function the way other people do before the have their preferred amount of coffee. 

As for the autism, I have hyperacusis, photophobia, and the ability to hyper focus on something, and mild to moderate issues with communication. The issues with communication can range from auditory processing issues, in which people sound like the Charlie Brown’s teacher, to understanding what someone said, but still missing the point. For example, years ago, I was working as a sacker at a grocery store. The customer asked me to bag the produce separately. You probably understand that she wanted the produce bagged together, separate from everything else. I thought that maybe the carrots were picking on the apples for being too fruity, or something. So, each bag of groceries got a single produce item in it. The customer was pretty chill about the issue, and I rebagged the groceries.

It may take him a few days to a couple of weeks to settle into his new routine, and then find his new calm. Please try to keep in touch with him however is comfortable for both you and him.

I'm not sure how your friend responds to certain situations, but I know that I can sometimes go ""robotic"" when I'm presented with an emotional or stressful situation. I'll have a blank expression on my face, and give the bare minimum effort to get through whatever situation I'm in. Later, when I have a chance to process the situation, I'll be more coherent, and be able to address any issues that have arisen. 

Overall, I'd advice you to do your best to keep in touch with your friend. Try to keep a certain ritual with him, such as lunch at your favorite cafe, or a biweekly movie night. Whenever you're presented with a stressful situation regarding him, please try to take a moment to breathe, and calm yourself.

AskReddit,fevgha9,t1_feu865a,1579397093.0,"I tried my damnedest to write up an answer the last time this question came up. I have ADHD and autism. Physically, Iâ€™m just a tad bit overweight, but I have trouble focusing on anything that doesnâ€™t interest me. Like, I need my Adderall to function the way other people do before the have their preferred amount of coffee. 

As for the autism, I have hyperacusis, photophobia, and the ability to hyper focus on something, and mild to moderate issues with communication. The issues with communication can range from auditory processing issues, in which people sound like the Charlie Brownâ€™s teacher, to understanding what someone said, but still missing the point. For example, years ago, I was working as a sacker at a grocery store. The customer asked me to bag the produce separately. You probably understand that she wanted the produce bagged together, separate from everything else. I thought that maybe the carrots were picking on the apples for being too fruity, or something. So, each bag of groceries got a single produce item in it. The customer was pretty chill about the issue, and I rebagged the groceries.

So, if youâ€™re willing to put up with all of that in exchange for encyclopedic knowledge of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and the reproductive habits of aquatic invertebrates, be my guest."

Now, onto the actual advice. His work schedule changing is a big change to his routine. Most autistic people are averse to changes in routine. It may take him a few days to a couple of weeks to settle into his new routine, and then find his new calm. Please try to keep in touch with him however is comfortable for both you and him. 

> did not provide much response from him.

I'm not sure how your friend responds to certain situations, but I know that I can sometimes go ""robotic"" when I'm presented with an emotional or stressful situation. I'll have a blank expression on my face, and give the bare minimum effort to get through whatever situation I'm in. Later, when I have a chance to process the situation, I'll be more coherent, and be able to address any issues that have arisen. 

Overall, I'd advice you to do your best to keep in touch with your friend. Try to keep a certain ritual with him, such as lunch at your favorite cafe, or a biweekly movie night. Whenever you're presented with a stressful situation regarding him, please try to take a moment to breathe, and calm yourself.
