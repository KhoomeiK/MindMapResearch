All the Halo Tops, while I enjoy them, don't check the same ""ice cream"" box that my brain is looking for. 😭"
AsianLadyboners,fdpgl66,t3_emf1b9,1578628079.0,Yep. On my way.

You may not see a huge difference, but those two people are not the same! Keep kicking ass, you've got this! 💪💪💪"

Will do. :)"

nextfuckinglevel,fdk8ss0,t1_fdjj9kc,1578498674.0,"Awww, it makes me sad that you're paranoid. Any one of us could get taken out by a rogue garbage truck tomorrow. Just live your best life without fear of what could come in the future (to ourselves or loved ones) or you'll look back and realize you spent your life fearing something that may never come. (Also, medical advancements happen all the time and I won't be shocked if we've got a cure or legitimate long-term, fully-effective symptom suppression very soon.)

And I would be very curious to do the shirt test to see if I could detect a trend."

nextfuckinglevel,fdk7u5g,t1_fdjjfsw,1578498061.0,"Awww, I actually enjoy it - for the most part. I've learned to keep my scent comments to myself because people never know what I'm talking about.

Funny you mention the simple food thing. I can't mix sweet and salty/savory in the same food item because it smells disgusting to me. More exotic foods I have to ignore the smell and just eat them to let my brain know that things can smell bad and taste good.

It's like how beef jerky, if you're not the one who is eating it, smells like rancid body odor. 😂"
nextfuckinglevel,fdk7exk,t1_fdjejme,1578497787.0,"Oh, just because I can smell those things more than most doesn't mean the smell bothers me.

I find some people's, ummm, musk quite intoxicating. I've been known to bury my face in areas on people because it smells so delightful. (was that vague enough without detailing a kink? Lol)

For me it's more that I'm obsessed with myself being clean before engaging in fun times, because I never know who can smell as many things as I can.

And, THAT being said, I actually really enjoy my own, ummm, scent."
Cyberpunk,fdjfgab,t3_elkaq0,1578468538.0,"😍 Love this. Nice work, man."
AskReddit,fdjfcfv,t1_fdhf47z,1578468413.0,"Or, when they do get the joke and make a joke that someone else doesn't get and they get whooshed for it.

So dumb."
nextfuckinglevel,fdjdnq6,t1_fdjcdp3,1578466493.0,"Hey, I don't want it either.

I would much rather be able to speak, read, write, and understand every possible language in existence. But, no. I get this shitty (pun-intended) power."
nextfuckinglevel,fdjdht2,t1_fdj7qwc,1578466310.0,"Facial hair for me is a mixture of skin oils, a slight snot smell, and whatever they've used to wash the facial hair. 😅 And I'm talking someone who has freshly cleansed. 

I can also identify the exact spot on someone's skin that has come into contact with human feces, even if they have scrubbed it 10+ times. 

The snot smell comment reminds me that I can smell respiratory illnesses, too. Woohoooo!

And, for me, redheads have what I can only describe as a stale milk smell.
Keep in mind that, in this case, a genetic code type smell being perceived by me is going to be different than how someone else smells it. We can thank major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) for helping us identify compatible mates. I am just not compatible with redheads. 😅
I was once, uh, drunkenly fooling around with a brunette. I stopped myself and asked, ""wait. Strange question. Have you ever been a redhead?"" Dude legit was coloring his eyebrows and head hair brown because he didn't like being a redhead.
Another time a redhead and I were making out and I remarked that it was incredible that she didn't have the ""redhead smell"" - she was just a red rinse in dark brown hair. Lol

And this is something that no amount of scrubbing or Axe bodywash can cover for me. I had to break up with a guy once because his was so strong and I couldn't get past it. It made me sick. 😭"

The other nurses would think I was a crazy."
fatlogic,fdj6epq,t1_fdiaj0e,1578459739.0,"Came to comment on just this. Interesting show.

I have a friend that was a dancer. Gained about 30 pounds, but she was super thin before so she definitely showed it.

Spent a year posting about her weight gain and how the doctors couldn't find anything wrong with her but she knew something was wrong and it was doing this horrible weight gain to her because she was barely eating anything. I kept saying, ""it doesn't matter if you've got a medical condition, just eat less than you burn and it will come off. Log your intake accurately."" (more tactfully, of course)

Shocking to none, she lost the weight through WW and became an advocate for actually logging what you eat. 😅"
nextfuckinglevel,fdj5qzo,t3_elkz78,1578459204.0,"I'm a nurse. I used to be able to walk into a room and identify that a patient had a wound and usually which type it was. Even if other people couldn't smell it.

I can identify if you have an ileostomy, colostomy, or not by smell when I walk in the room. 

I can tell you certain meds you're on based on the smell of your waste products.

I can smell if you have facial hair from a few feet away if my eyes are closed.

I can tell you if you need to clean your scalp, face, or other parts within a few feet of you.

I can tell you if you've got a decent cavity even if you've just brushed, flossed, and used mouthwash.

I can tell if you're a natural redhead by smelling you.

I can identify different toys and materials by scent even if people think they're odorless.

I can smell and taste a plethora of minerals and retained things on drinking glasses, water, ice, etc. (plain water tastes like I'm drinking rocks from the ground)



I bet I could be trained to ID some Parkinsons."
