If your attitude even before you start is ""I hate this, why am I doing this, this is just going to be pure torture, fuck this"", then what do you expect is going to happen? You're going to hate whatever it is that you're doing, because you're set on hating it right from the start.

fatlogic,ff9t5ea,t1_ff9qnh5,1579720698.0,"I'm not sure which objection to start with, because there are multiple.

At the weight these guys exist at, even walking becomes a moderate intensity exercise - and they're hardly sedentary. They do cardio just by existing. Not to mention stuff like farmer walks - plenty of WSM events are partially endurance based rather than about one rep maxes. It doesn't need to be jogging to be aerobic exercise.

While it's hardly a priority for them, check out the workout schedules of Hafthor or Brian Shaw. They still do explicit conditioning work too, even if it's just a little.

Lastly, but hardly an unimportant concern, these guys juice. A lot. Every single one of them is on steroids and lots of them. This profoundly changes the game - you have much less of a need to train your aerobic capacity if all the androgens you take turn your blood into a red blood cell jello. You don't have that luxury if you don't inject grams of gear.

fatlogic,ff9gt25,t1_ff9e8zx,1579712703.0,"That relationship is not nearly so straightforward. Lifting heavy is a metabolically taxing activity - your ability to recover between sets is directly affected by how good your cardio is.

Who do you think is going to make more gains, the guy who is at still gassed five minutes after a hard set, because his cardio is so shit or the guy who is basically fresh and ready to go for another round in two thirds that time? 

How much volume you can push at the gym is meaningfully affected by your aerobic conditioning. Whether you're going to need to chug intra workout shakes(which cuts into diet quality) instead of mobilizing fat reserves to maintain optimal output is affected by your ability to oxidize fat. Whether you're going to get injured because you accumulate more fatigue per set is, again, influenced by your cardio.

It's not nearly as simple of a relationship as you're making it sound.

Now, obviously, there is a volume of cardio that is so high that you're going to lose more than you gain, especially if it's running, which is particularly demanding. You aren't going to be building a meaningful amount of muscle while doing ten hours of running a week(or even five, really), it's just too much for anyone(for anyone not on juice, anyway) to recover from.

Edit: And, very importantly to my overall point, just like you can't accidentally Arnold, you can't accidentally Kenyan marathoner either. Worrying about 'but muh gains' is extremely alike to worrying about accidentally bulking up too much.

This might be a tougher question if we were talking merely below average girl or whatever, but 1/10 is as low as the scale goes - ie. we're talking the most hideously repulsive human being imaginable, in which case her willingness to do whatever doesn't matter. 

There's no amount of kinkiness that she can offer that would get me going if she's got flesh-eating bacteria, oozing pus, necrotic tissue or whatever other hideously disfiguring issue she's got that knocks her down to a 1/10.

The 10/10 arrangement is not perfect either, but it's at least plausible that you might be able to convince her to an open relationship - in which case, she could be quite the wingman."
DebateAVegan,fdzb21a,t3_encepn,1578788389.0,"Not that long ago, within my lifetime in fact(and I'm not that old), people much like you would have made the same arguments about LGBT acceptance - that it has a small minority support, the majority will never accept it, marriage equality is a pipe dream that's never going to happen, lesbians and gays just have to accept their lot in life etcera.

And yet, here we are, with marriage equality recognized in quite a few countries nowadays.

Things change. Your confidence in the futility of this fight is unwarranted."

If you told people that your real reason for quitting is that it's kinda inconvenient, that you miss the taste of cheesecake or that peer pressure got to you... people might give you shit for that. Even other omnivores might rub it in.

Tell people that it's for *health*, however and people will generally respect that. Other omnis will pat you on the back for reinforcing the stereotypes and welcome you back into the fold.

Not that I think people are knowingly lying, but I do think they're rationalizing how no, really, it was all about health, not the cheesecake."

In light of that, the flaw in the idea that people can accurately assess that a plant based made them unhealthy should be obvious. Approximately 90% of those people are completely clueless about nutrition, so they're incapable of making that judgement."
fatlogic,fcmwzpn,t1_fcmkimw,1577796018.0,"I'm willing to give *some* benefit of the doubt there - I wouldn't be surprised if this was something that came up with reasonable frequency.

Why? Demographics of FAs. Who would we expect to see involved in the movement? There's some thin allies and ""thin-passing smallfats"", sure, but I expect you'd see a disproportionate amount of super morbidly obese people compared to general population.

At that point, I suspect you'd start seeing interventions reasonably commonly.

I do agree that they're almost certainly wildly exaggerated. It's most likely just families trying to gently bring up a touchy subject and show that they care and want to help, which gets retold in FA circles as evil aunt Karen attempting homemade liposuction on the heroic FA who bravely attempts to resist her psycho family."
WouldYouRather,fcla7ln,t1_fckuxdj,1577743173.0,"Yeah, I would guess that my hack would only work if you *actually follow through* the next day. At least, that's the logic that makes sense to me based on fictional time travel tropes.

So if you tell yourself ""I will kill this guy if such-and-such sporting bet(with awesomely unlikely odds of course) wins"", then it stands to reason that this only works if, when you win the next day, you really go do it.

Which is why it's great power to have for an aspiring supervillain, not so much for the rest of us.

Edit: In retrospect, you can gain much more than a bit of information per victim, since you also have some control over the date of death. So, for example, if you ask a question that can be answered in four ways, commit to killing someone tomorrow with answer 1, day after with answer 2, day after with answer 3 and so on. You could potentially ask very complex precognitive queries like this."
WouldYouRather,fckt7y6,t1_fck99p6,1577732674.0,"That's interesting. If their fate can be altered by your actions, then that becomes a **much** more useful power, at least for a certain sort of person.

What sort of person? Someone willing to murder.

Pre-commit to killing a specific person if the stock price of stock X goes up tomorrow. If their date of death changes to tomorrow, buy the stock. If it doesn't, short it. This is just one example, but you could gain a bit(in the literal binary digit sense) of future knowledge for every pre-commitment, easily answering binary questions about the future. With more pre-commitments, you could gain answers to more complex questions, one bit of knowledge for each.

In short, if fate can be altered and you're willing to kill, then this power can be hacked to provide you with a crude form of general precognition - and even a few bits of general future knowledge is an unbelievably powerful ability.

Edit: Probably much easier(and legal) to make this work if ""everyone"" works on animals. Just buy some rats and you won't even risk getting in trouble with the law."

The chances that some random guy commenting on the validity of BMI online has a body that could win IFBB pro bodybuilding shows are, how do I put it, low.

The authors of those guidelines have a rather [different conclusion](https://imgur.com/m0ZPwao) than the one that FAs want for you to believe - it's not ""weight loss is futile"".

Rather, the take-away message is ""weight regain is a real risk"". Which is true and a ""so what else is new?"" sort of conclusion. Complacency is an enemy, but there's no special magic going on here, it's just returning to your old habits."

Climate change deniers are stubborn, fanatical morons - it's a prerequisite to being a climate change denier in the first place. They will outlast honest, rational well-meaning people through pure bullheaded stubbornness and because arguing with brick walls is, at the end of the day, just not all that engaging as an activity, so well-meaning people will either engage less or just leave.

Which means that, over time, the quality of discourse will decrease.

If you allow for morons to fling shit in a chess park, you don't end up with some vibrant community of free thinking chess masters there. You just end up with a lot of shit-covered chessboards and an empty park - the chess masters will just go somewhere else instead of dealing with all the crap.

Now if you're fine with that in the name of some free speech principle or whatever, okay, fair enough, but you're not proposing any sort of solution here - you're just pretending the problem doesn't exist."
