It was loud as shit and everyone always wondered what the fuck was wrong with this bird that had to wake everyone up for no apparent reason every damn day. Yin would just stand there in silence looking embarrassed and apologetic.

I used to hang the cage outside on the veranda during the day when the weather permitted it so they could get some sun, some fresh air, and have deep philosophical debates with the local wild birds. One day I brought the cage inside and Yang had vanished. I was obviously upset, I love my pets but I was even more dumbfounded. How the fuck had this bird escaped? 

As you can guess I later noticed a small hole in the cage from a single bar being snapped in half, in the exact spot he was slowly chipping away at. All I could do was laugh and feel nothing but the utmost respect for this bird. He wanted his freedom and so he went all Shawshank on me. 

Yin could have left too, I'm sure he's smart enough to notice his companions jailbreak and follow suit but Yin was content with the domestic life. Several months later he fell ill, stopped eating or moving and pined for the fjords.

I like to think Yang is still alive out there somewhere, eating seeds and chatting up some birds, happy as could be. Enjoy your freedom Yang, you earnt it you son of a bitch."
