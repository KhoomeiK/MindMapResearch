It wasn't implied. I told you that it sounds to me more like a borderline personality thing (that specific thing, not all), and that your psychiatrist telling you that you are not bipolar might have sense because it does sound like you're dealing with different problems. Maybe those problems on top of bipolar. It's also possible.

You did it while still depressed or hurt: ""trying to outrun the hopelessness, fear and desperation I was really in"". Manic episodes are different, in my experience.
