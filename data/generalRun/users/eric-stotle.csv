Also need to get another copy of stranger than fiction, best one imo, the short stories alongside the backstories of their respective authors alongside the tale of them trapped together was such a crazy dynamic.

Also, can I have my still-beating heart back please? I just finished cooking some ramen."

IdiotsInCars,ff5orha,t1_ff4oz7b,1579603696.0,"There was a Chuck Palahniuk book called “Rant” and in it there was this group of young adults who created a game called “party crashing” using some kind of visual indicator on their car to participate (coffee mug or grocery bag glued to the roof, fully decorated Christmas tree, etc...) they would crash into each other and score points based on various factors... couldn’t get it out of my head watching this, especially with the black bags hanging out their trunks. Good read though, gonna have to scour my HPB tomorrow."

tales,ff16qxc,t3_eqzhjw,1579475784.0,"It honestly confuses me that they haven’t put in at least one character from a tales game. The combat systems already share so many similarities, plus I think they could easily implement some new mechanics like having alternate artes that you could switch to for special attacks. It just seems like such a missed opportunity to me. :/ plus I’d rather see yuri or milla rather than Lloyd. No hate, symphonia is easily top 3 tales games for me, but Lloyd was always so whiny and I feel while his character definitely matured in his world view, he didn’t make any real character development until you see the repercussions of his actions in that god awful sequel."

tales,fd2gf34,t3_ejuf1w,1578146847.0,"Ha Flynn does suck. It was one of those tales endings that just... well ends. It doesn’t really give you a good conclusion or resolution. Which double sucks because they reuse so many story concepts from older games too. Plus the post-game dungeons are monotonous as fudge. All that being said I still subjectively love it and think it has its objective merits too. The combat and skill systems are incredible and the NG+ is a lot of fun on mania difficulty, but that requires you to grind enough grade to get all the good bonuses. It’s biggest flaw was it’s unashamed grinding aspects."
