You don't say how old the kids are but if they're young, you can't expect a thank you card from those ones. :) 

Joking aside, I'm not sure it's a good idea to go to some parties and bring a gift and then not even acknowledge others. Even young kids can from left out and not understand why and honestly, the blame probably doesn't fall on them. These days, it seems it's not very common to send out thank you cards or such anymore, as we all seem to use social media to keep in touch, and with kids too young to use that...they're not really to blame if no one's taught them. I feel like this is more a 'on the parents/changing norms.' 

If you go to the party and give a gift/card, is the recipient not saying thank you at the time? If they are, it seems odd to expect further gratitude. If they aren't or the situation doesn't exactly present itself (opening gifts after everyone leaves) you can always call to ensure they got your gift and that it was something they enjoyed. If you weren't able to attend and sent something, call them and do the same. It's possible that with a handful of kids, it might not be the first priority to send out thank you's, though I definitely understand the 'its common courtesy and everyone should learn' idea. 

It's an odd situation, as if they were your children, it'd be within your responsibility to teach them gratitude and to be thankful because no one owes them a gift; however, they are not, so what I would suggest is making it clear that gift giving is something you enjoy and it means a lot when you're able to give them something they truly like. Because that's what it comes down to when you give. You do it because you want to, not on the condition that you must be thanked (though I understand not wanting to give something to someone who doesn't appreciate it.) Reach out to the parents and be honest, not accusatory, and let them know how delighted you'd be get a thank you card/call. 

TL:DR: I would lean towards kids aren't being taught the common courtesy of a thank you message and it's totally appropriate to reach out to the parents to ensure your gift was received and something the kids liked. However, sending some gifts and others nothing sends an unclear message and will definitely set you up for a bad relationship with most involved. It's not a jerk move to say you felt a little hurt by not getting a thank you, but the Willy nilly approach with no explanation is. I'm not sure how to remedy the entire issue, as teaching them basic manners or reprimanding them for a lack of them might cause a rift between you and the parents; however there comes a time when children are old enough to know those basic rules and be held accountable. But not communicating and giving them the silent treatment will help nothing."

You've stated that you aren't comfortable with this last request. You have an emotional reaction to a request that of the two you, only you  will need to live with (pun intended.) It's not ok for him to expect this of you. Perhaps there's a compromise: diamonds in a nice display case or smaller ones in jewelery or making a nice piece of pottery from his ashes. There's a million places to meet in the middle of his final requests, though if this was an attempt to cling to control or keep a foot in the door so to speak, he probably won't be amenable to a compromise.

People seem to assume those who desire to be famous have certain negative qualities, like selfishness or such, and that whatever craft they're peddling, like acting, must be done 'because they love it.' They can't say they want to be rich and famous, or at least not loudly, or the public turns on them and calls them fame whores. Like, god forbid someone want to be rich and adored...it's not like they're out there saying they want to wear socks and sandals and be adored ."
