You shouldn't have been made to feel like you should nanny in the first place, and your family making jokes about you being overwhelmed is ridiculous. Being pressured into quitting your jobs to work massive overtime and make less than minimum wage watching children is so wrong.

That's really a very strange comment to make in this situation. It also seems unnecessary to angrily snap at someone who made a mistake. If she WAS talking to you for some odd reason, if she's only done this once, and she was clearly mistaken, it's not exactly bullying, is it? It could have just been a slip of the tongue and she didn't mean to say anything at all.

Maybe the spot in your living room is too out in the open and not private enough, or it's too loud, or something else could be offending them.

Also, I would honestly just get another box and put it where it was in the hallway and figure out a ventilation solution or set up some sort of odor control. You need a third box. The rule is 1 for each cat +1, so your cats need access to three boxes. I know it sounds like a lot, but it's kind of important for them to have a good number of places to go, or they will eventually start going just anywhere."

Your post fails then. You have given us information:

You share a bio mother.
He is not her bio father.
He IS YOUR bio father.
He has adopted her.

Now you're saying don't trust that info, trust you.

He IS her adopted father. He is ALSO her stepfather. That is just how it is. And if that's how she feels, *she has every right* to feel that way. You are not in her head. You can't know that she doesn't see him that way. She could be internally wanting to explore finding her bio father. She did not lie. You are picking apart the things she's doing and saying because you are insecure and you don't want her to ""take your things from you."" This is understandable. I know middle children. But you are handling the situation poorly."

Your sister was not lying. You said in another comment that you share a biological mother. So your father is her step-dad. A step-parent can adopt a step-child and still be considered a step parent. Adopting just makes things legal, but that doesn't mean he suddenly stops being her step dad. You can't control how your sister feels about the family dynamic, and you shouldn't act like you simply know. You aren't her.

You are arguing petty details that don't matter, (you even admitted it wasn't the comment that bothered you, it was just the stepdad part) to paint your sister as the bad guy in this situation, when the only bad guy is your insecurities."

personalfinance,feo38b1,t3_eq67t8,1579294572.0,"This kind of all depends on what you personally want out of life. It seems like either choice is financially doable for you. Is your mom okay with you staying? Is she rushing you out? If you want to stay to keep saving up and she's okay with it, theres no shame in it. The sources you're seeing claiming 24 is the age limit to stay with your parents are dumb and outdated. It's hard as hell for people to live on their own now. People are staying with their parents later and later, which can be beneficial to both parties, especially if you're helping your mom out financially by paying for yourself.

Do you want to strike out on your own? This is also a valid option. This roommate situation sounds pretty decent and at some point or another, it's good to get out and experience being away from your family. It's also good to make mistakes and learn from them. If you end up not liking the roommate situation, you can always change your plans when the lease is up and move on to something else.

But yet, she's *excited* about your baby being born? Why? You have to think of the reasons she would be excited for a newborn in a family she hasn't even married into yet and has committed actual crimes against.

Just because something isn't necessarily sexual, doesn't mean it's not intimate, and I can see where your boyfriend's feelings were hurt.

To be fair, you were in her room so it stands to reason that she could sing there if she wants. That being said, she reacted kind of terribly
 
I've never heard of that level of extreme attitude stemming from a period. She might need to go to the doctor to see if she has some sort of hormonal imbalance that's causing her behavioral issues or she's just a spoiled brat. There's really not a good excuse for her actions, but she seems extremely young and young teenagers tend to be that way anyway.

Him never taking your requests to heart also makes him sort of an asshole, which is why I'm going with esh.

You should ask yourself if you really want to stay best friends with someone you have very strong feelings for, who will never reciprocate those feelings. Is staying close friends worth the heartache?"
AmItheAsshole,fcop8bb,t3_eib4d1,1577837930.0,"YTA. This has to be some humblebrag shitpost of epic proportions. I used to be a stocker at an arts and crafts store and we were allowed to wear earphones while stocking as long as we were paying attention to the customers that came up to us... Which this girl was doing by YOUR OWN ADMISSION. She acknowledged and helped you. What are you so upset about? And calling up there to MAKE SURE the girl was punished? Really? I'm sure they're super bummed about you not shopping there anymore.

If someone I only hang out a couple times a year randomly asks me for $10 for an overdrawn account, I'd be a little weirded out. You also admitted in a different comment that you mismanaged your money, and you stated that you talked to him about finances and budgeting and stuff before, so he could be thinking that you're just super bad with money. I dunno. Feel like there's a lot more to this story."

Honestly, if someone did that with a gift I gave them, returned it and gave me the money back, doesn't matter if it was my husband of 3 years or my mom or a friend. I would *never* get that person a present again. 

It's a little weird that you were upset about not getting any presents from your family, and now you want to get rid of one he got you?

Maybe it's just me, but being 26 and getting upset that your family couldn't get you any Christmas presents seems a little childish. I'm sorry, but I guess I just don't understand why you would be upset at all. It doesn't seem like a big deal. Maybe not getting one from your boyfriend, I could understand being a little sad possibly, but isn't it normal to not receive as many or no gifts at all from family after a certain point. Are presents honestly that important?

I feel like maybe you could see stand to reorganize your priorities a just little bit and not worry about whether or not you're going to get a present?"
AmItheAsshole,fc7ndth,t3_egn0hi,1577513246.0,"NTA, and honestly the photographer here was way in the wrong. Depending on the photographer situation, you definitely need to leave a bad review so others know that this person cannot be trusted to follow directions and do the job they were hired to do. Possibly try to get your money back. Did you sign a contact?

Your MIL is a piece of work and is garbage for obvious reasons, but that photographer was YOUR hire and they ignored your direction and followed someone who literally had nothing to do with the situation instead and ruined the photos. That is in no way professional. I would be livid at both of them."

I'm pretty poor trash myself but I have been admiring Vera Bradley stuff for years. I once found a limited edition VB bag at a second hand store for $6 and that literally made my entire month. Also finding a VB laptop bag on sale for $30 at a discount retailer was like finding a gold nugget in a garbage bin. The actual retail prices make my eyes water a little.

You can live your whole life with it and never once have an obvious outbreak. You can also get herpes with literally no sexual contact. Cold sores are herpes, and if you touch your face, then touch your junk, you can spread it down there easily, and then you can spread that if you have an outbreak and you have unprotected sex. It's annoying but it's definitely not a big deal. It's more than likely never going to be a huge problem in your actual day to day life."

Pretty scandalous, I know, but I was 19 when I started dating my now husband, who was 26 at the time. Weirdly our lives were just kind of in the same space and despite the 7 1/2 year age difference, we were really able to grow together. I'm 26 now and ""outgrowing"" him has never been an issue. You should adjust your thinking a bit, and not be so paranoid. You may not have problems now, but if you keep worrying about this without any just cause, you will create problems and that's not fair to your girlfriend."

AmItheAsshole,fc2pjlq,t3_efvqf4,1577370158.0,"ESH. That was really rude of them to regift it to you. They could have pulled you aside and explained that they don't want their kid exposed to the song and given it back to you to return for your money back, which is understandable, they are not TA for that whatsoever. They do have a say in what their kid is exposed to, they went about it shitty and passive aggressive though, and it makes them seem ungrateful.

You would be TA if you regifted it back to them again. It would be petty as hell and again, they had valid reasons for not wanting it, (and your attitude in regards to this point kind of sucks tbh. Just because they don't like it is a good reason to not have it in their house.) so trying to force it would not be a good look. Just try to return it for your money back or donate it to a child in need.

And please don't take this event as an excuse to never buy this child a gift again due to their parents' attitudes. It really isn't their fault. A safe gift for kids imo will always be some sort of (silent) book suitable for their age, and you can get tons of them for cheap from different sources."

No shame in the bachelor lifestyle, but there is some in being super childish about your girlfriend using your SHARED SPACE to do something she agreed to do.

AmItheAsshole,fc27bpj,t3_efs71l,1577343755.0,"YTA. You're setting a really dumb standard if that's what you're trying to do. You both share the apartment. She has as much right to it as you do, especially if she pays rent. There is literally no excuse for you to force her to pay for an airbnb. Could she have given you a heads up? Sure. But this overreaction from yours is just that - an overreaction. It's fine to be upset about this, but you are going too far with the whole forcing your girlfriend out of the apartment and forcing her to pay out of pocket for a place to watch the kids, and going on about this disrespect nonsense is a little childish. How do you think that makes you look to your girlfriend? Is this a hill you really want to die on? Over one night of babysitting. I don't personally think it is to be honest.
