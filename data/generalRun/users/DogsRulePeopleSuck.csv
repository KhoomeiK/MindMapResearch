He is an absolute mess now after years of doinf various drugs, can't even speak properly, i think he got so bad becuase he's never been told it's wrong or could harm him."

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fejqm3y,t1_fejit7g,1579183373.0,I'm not saying she's lying or telling the truth but we don't know all the facts. What we do no is that Chris has never had a problem with publically bashing Kail together or Not. That says to be he's at least comfortable with verbal abuse in public just imagine behind closed doors.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fejq13l,t3_epfap4,1579182911.0,"I dont think it would work between them and would be a foolish idea, he was never happy with Corey and Cheyanne's relationship and since Cory and Chey fucked not long after she split from Zach...."

offmychest,fejjcg3,t3_epbqvo,1579176705.0,"I have dyslexia and it's so annoying when people point out misspellings, they pretend it's for you, but its so that they feel better and above you. Knowing this i just call them out now like does it make you feel good picking on someones Disorder and highlighting it to a room full of people."

AmericanHorrorStory,feguy7q,t3_ep2l7w,1579103109.0,i think a season of like a 'gay slayer' could be interesting cosidering this has happened alot in history and would be an interesting concept of an underground gay community and they could take inspiration from people like Gacey and  Colin Ireland

offmychest,fdn5dg1,t1_fdn4xrz,1578577744.0,"Well you take care man, try not to let it bother you and use it to drive you to work harder and better yourself from where your family are financially. Everytime you dont want to study just think of that guys partents spoiling him and you having to save so hard and think about that when you have a great job and career you can have all the parts you want! That guy sounds awful and you probably wont know him in 10years if he doesnt sort him attitude."
offmychest,fdn4vu8,t1_fdn40to,1578577354.0,"Oh Dear, some people just dont have the ability to empathise, now you get to decide how you behave you can either go off on him and call him out on all of it and potentially end your friendship, you can just give him absolutely nothing when he tells you these things like be normal for everything else but when he brings up computer stuff shut it down with yes, no, cool and ok, or you can just ignore it all completely laugh it off and carry on as normal let him be a jerk but it's not bringing you down. how old is he if you dont mind me asking?"

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fdk4qit,t3_elmmmm,1578496010.0,"What she doesnt realise is she doesnt look bad for not wanting to pump birth control drugs into her body, she looks bad because she still chooses to have sex with 2 boys at the same time both unprotected, while she has an infant who needs her to get a job. She can't afford this child never mind another one! She thought it was all funny with her other teenage friends and then when aload of adults have their opinion she doesnt like it."
AreYouTheOne,fdk1va0,t1_fdk16mr,1578493990.0,"Yeah i think they all get to a point where they try to figure out what the public is interested in them for and then they ramp it up. Like Julia from season 4 figured sex sells and now shes a glamour model.

offmychest,fdjkmyd,t1_fdi9len,1578475341.0,"I really dont want you to experience anymore hardship, but i have seen it before so often where you wait for the right time to tell her and there never really is a right time for this sort of thing, it's going to be dificult but the longer you leave it the longer he has to get his claws into her and make it less likely for your mother to believe in you, as this is early days with them i would suggest sooner than later. I hope all goes well for you and that you can finally get this evil out of your family x"

offmychest,fdgsrqo,t3_elbbf4,1578407386.0,"Go for it my man, talk to her it's much better than guessing, before you chat to her make sure you have some back-up topics incase the conversation runs dry. Try for the conversation to be things your both interested in and ask lots of follow up questions to what she says. If you dont know about a hobby of hers ask her to explain it and take a real interest you'll be golden. Most of us females just really like it when people want to know more about us and ask us about what we like."

Teetotal,fcuizfn,t1_fcu858b,1577982077.0,"Thank you, yeah i think i do need to learn that because it isnt just this that is effected by me being a pushover. Thank god i never have been slipped alcohol or spiked as people who know me know that i can't tolorate most drinks anyway and will throw up. The Medication thing is actually genius i can't believe i did'nt think of that, i'm actually due to be switching soon anyways so i will say that i can't drink with that. The hard part is when i dont drink people assume i'm pregnant which is also upsetting as i have fertility issues so i'd like to avoid people speculating about that and your suggestion will really help me. Thank you so much :)"
