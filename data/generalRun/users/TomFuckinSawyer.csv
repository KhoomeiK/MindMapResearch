dogs,fffvs8i,t1_ffft25r,1579892877.0,"Sketchy, sure, but that large dog should have enough manners to know what's what, especially in a dog park setting or something of that ilk. I would wager a healthy amount that the owners are far more concerned with size than the dogs. 

My dog is on the larger side, and he's set boundaries for a chihuahua and a kitten, and he had his clock set at an early age by a dog a lot smaller than him. The size shouldn't make a difference, and a properly raised dog should know how to deal with other dogs."
dogs,fffvct1,t1_ffftiua,1579892607.0,"What you're doing isn't wrong, by any means. All I would offer is that there is a healthy amount of playing and social structuring that dogs need from other dogs, and we as humans can't give them that specific ""heads up"" on life.

No amount of barbershops or microbreweries will pad the loss of these buildings, and no amount of trampoline parks will save our malls. 

The times they are a-becoming quite different. Our city is in dire need of a financial overhaul far more than we need to save an old church. A broke city can’t fix a building nobody wants, but they can sell it to someone who wants the land.  As much as I agree on tourism front, we don’t have the money to save that either. 

The city needs the province and Irving to pay its fair share. We see millions leave this city in industry taxes, and it goes to Fredericton and stays there. Irving pays less in taxes on his lube plant than the Tim Hortons next door.
