I’m also trying to understand what average Joes like yourself are so protective of the wealth of Billionaires like the Waltons and Bezoses. It’s so bootlicky. There’s a happy medium between fair taxation and taxation that stifles innovation. Corporations really didn’t need the massive tax cut they got, nor did the top 0.1% of wealth-holders.

I think the person Trump would most like to run against is Bernie. Most people under 30 cannot apprehend the power of the word socialism for people over 50 who make up the largest and most reliable part of the electorate. You know how it will go:

“Do you want to continue this historic unemployment rate? Or do you want bread lines? Do you want to keep your doctor, or do you trust the government to choose your doctor for you? Do you like low taxes, or are you ready to give big government more than half of what you earn.”

Turbines remain operational 20-25 years as well. And again, oil refining, extraction, pipelines, these things all take up space. One thing America has is space. And that space does not become unusable (though possibly uninhabitable) and is used, for example, as pasture in Texas and Oklahoma who have had huge wind booms.
