Just realize that the poster itself will never command the value that it would un-drymounted. However, there are possible ways to reverse the dry mounting process depending on the way it was done. But you’ll have to consult a professional and it will be expensive. 

To me, I’d probably walk away. But if you’ve got the cash and you want to look at a cool poster on your wall, then go for it!"

StarWars,fcujjmy,t1_fcrrbua,1577982448.0,"Not cloudy bottom right corner, probably legit. But what sells me the most on the legitimacy is this: I can't see anyone spending custom framing money on a fake poster. A triple mat with custom frame at that size would probably run close to $500. $650 is a great deal.

THAT being said, I'd really want to know if it was framed without drymounting (gluing to a backing board) it. That would kill any value it has and it is quite common for framers to do unless you specifically tell them not to do it."
