I loved her. I do and always will, but I’ve also come to accept that our relationship is over. I do not hate her, I feel compassion for her, I will always love her and our time together. But I just accept that we weren’t right together. Maybe a few years in the future, who knows, but I’m not hoping for it, even though we are mutually blocked everywhere and didn’t end on good terms.

I’ve had another/rebound relationship since her, which lasted 6 months and ended 4 months ago. 

I really did love that woman, she ended things because something was missing. I have to accept that too. We ended on good terms but are no longer speaking despite not being blocked. 

I hope one day to fix things with her, I don’t hate her. I actually still miss her even though there are many dislikes about the break up and how she has ignored me. She never even tried to fix things just walked away.

There’s a bit of hope there, time could maybe fix it. For now I’m just working on myself and I’m open to seeing other people but I don’t see myself falling in love any time soon.

At most she probably thinks “oh what a silly thing that was” - I doubt she was traumatised and sleepless or needing therapy from it. You don’t know what she was thinking, if she initiated sex she could have simply thought you were rejecting her if you didn’t go ahead.

Also you don’t know if she was in love with you. Attracted sure, love, unlikely.


2) You expressed a desire to do an act and you asked. She said no and you respected her wish and did not do it. You asked again, she still said no, you abided by her wishes. You did not rape her, you asked her consent and she said no and you respected her wishes. 


I would personally let sleeping dogs lie and not bring up the past. It’s not going to change anything."

But I need to just let her go and stop reaching out to her so that I can heal and respect myself before she can do that for me. I know it’s not the answer you want to hear but the answer is to just let go of the wheel, relax, and let things take their course.

Don’t break no contact if you’re still healing, it makes it so much worse on yourself.

Oh and we broke up 3.5 months ago, probably similar time to you. I’d no contact for 2-3 weeks at a time and then break it - it was a mistake every time. If I didn’t keep resetting no contact, I’d have made more progress by now."

Ain’t an easy way around it. Break ups suck. Relationships fall apart because people don’t communicate, but you cannot force someone to care enough to want to send you a simple fucking text that says hey how are you or how’s things. 

Fuck. I lost my job today and I still miss my ex and we are in no contact, nothing in my life is fucking permanent any more.

My guess is this guy, maybe, has had very few “casual” hook ups. His experience is likely to be from only having long term dating sex.

I was guilty of being overly needy from a hook up, but I was perfectly “capable” of casual sex. 

OP just come clean as soon as you can. Just tell him you enjoyed it, you just want to hook up and be friends, and you don’t want to date. 

It’s theoretically win-win until feelings and jealousy get involved. Obviously if you start hooking up with someone else he is going to get jealous - don’t discuss hook ups at all."

A lot of reading in to why nice guys finish last and why woman like a bad boy or are attracted to assholes. Its got nothing to do with being rude, it’s more to do with being confident and being a challenge to a chase.

Woman are more interested in you when they arnt sure on how you feel. To put that in logical guy terms say a gorgeous model proposed to you on a third date... you’d be flattered but suspicious and red flags would be waving, you’d be thinking wtf is wrong with her this is too much pressure. That’s the exaggerated reality of how a girl feels when you gift her stuff for no reason."

Especially no passive aggressive “when someone hurts you” text post bullshit which is usually what woman do - and don’t start trying to make her jealous or drastically changing.

Basically your social media should patch your offline attitude: don’t say anything to her or about the break up or how you are feeling. 

Ideally you want to just ghost her without blocking until she reaches out."

Just walk away. Do not pour your heart out to her or but her a gift or write her a letter or try to reason with her or anything like that.

She broke up with you because she lost attraction to you. Mystery will rebuild her attraction and allow her to miss you and panic.

I’m doing this as to not be needy, unfortunately it’s the games of dating that happen now - I’ve had a ons before and then double / triple text her over a week later and never heard from her again. I probably would have heard from her again if I had never text her."

But just trust me on this, she already likes you, buying her a gift isn’t going to make her like you more but it will add more pressure and make things less fun. 

She then subconsciously thinks “what is her trying to buy from me, what do I have to gift him in return? Sex? Money? Why is he trying to manipulate me? Does he not think hes as good I think he is? And if he does what’s wrong with him.... “
