Disneyland,ff8ehao,t3_erquyu,1579675053.0,Starbucks is the new McDonalds so makes sense it’s the one in the parks now. I wonder what will be the next big thing...
disneyemojiblitz,ff2iuy9,t3_er8oyl,1579508090.0,This is the way.
Disneyland,ff2ik94,t1_ff2gq0o,1579507698.0,A fellow Big Thunder fan! This guy trains.
Disneyland,ff2ge0g,t3_er10ts,1579504994.0,Just spotted the lil Rey! Too cute.
Disneyland,ff2gao1,t3_eqzeco,1579504885.0,"I’ve taken the Walk In Walt’s Footsteps tour but it was 15 years ago and a lot has changed since then. I’ll always treasure it as one if my best Disneyland experiences. I do have my eyes on the new train tour, as it allows the guests to see the Lilly Belle parlor car. It’s my absolute last Disneyland “must do” outside of Club 33, which has honestly diminished for me as a “must do” in recent years.

DIY,ff280r5,t3_er14x8,1579496479.0,"I’ve used RIT dye on a couple different projects. One of my favorite learned things was that it won’t dye screenprinted graphics. So you can comfortably dye almost any shirt a fresh, new color and it won’t ruin the graphic. Customization is fun!"
DIY,ff27w7u,t1_ff1fedi,1579496369.0,"If you read OP’s comments in the linked photos, you’d know that the back of the bag stayed gray. And that they washed and completely dried the bag 2 times after rinsing the dye because they were concerned about this exact thing."

Disneyland,fea788q,t3_enn8hp,1578945168.0,"I have fond memories of being a third wheel while my older brother flirted with the neighbor’s daughter we went on vacation with in a multi-level Starcade. It was 1998 and the only thing that ever made me feel the same was the first time I went to a Circus Circus, and eventually, Casinos. The three of us took our picture with Sorcerer Mickey. It was 1998 and I rocked a backwards hat and a flannel around my waist. Tomorrowland was poppin’ because No Doubt played there and Star Wars hadn’t been pimped out yet. I really miss that vibe..."
GetMotivated,fcypx3c,t1_fcx8052,1578084679.0,Sometimes you can be a good person and others only use you for that instead of valuing and appreciating you. Consider alternative perspectives before inserting yourself.
sanfrancisco,fcvs0sz,t3_ej1u5l,1578008795.0,I love this so much!!
GetMotivated,fctooww,t1_fcoh3za,1577951806.0,"It’s almost as if you think my not being happy, valued, and appreciated by others is a personality defect that I could fix. It is not. How good of a person someone is doesn’t equate to how much they are considered or cared for by others."
GetMotivated,fco7ezd,t3_ehw7e1,1577825520.0,"Not feeling happy, valued, or appreciated on Earth so guess I’ll kill myself. Thanks!"
disneyemojiblitz,fco6nxe,t1_fcncaef,1577825097.0,"I actually use Darkwing a lot for star missions (not as good as a star maker, obvs) because he makes it easier to create stars if you plan it right. YMMV, of course."
oddlysatisfying,fco4tm8,t1_fcnz6yx,1577824095.0,So I guess that petition to stop the fireworks in Australia because of all the brush fires didn’t do shit?
Showerthoughts,fch6u57,t3_eh4v2c,1577647793.0,But that’s not how fire works...
starterpacks,fc9q08h,t3_egnuzx,1577556452.0,"I’m all in for giving up so completely on fashion/style/body shapes that we popularize wearing blankets. Everyone should carry a blanket, a water bottle, and emergency snacks. We’re all just giant babies who learned to hold our shit in and don’t you forget it!"
Disneyland,fc7cqpy,t3_eghkwb,1577503610.0,"The train is my absolute favorite! It seamlessly rolls in through all the themed stations of the different lands, really tying the park together. There’s a part of me that wonders what it would be like if it rolled through Batuu, but I’m more interested in saving the immersion. My only grip with DCA is that there isn’t a train equivalent. I would absolutely enjoy that park more if there were a transit system of some sort. 


I really try to take all the atmosphering of each station. I love that we get to dip into my favorite scene on Splash Mountain, but I wish there was more Frontierland on the train route. That’s a station I’d love to see! There should definitely be some sort of train-lovers tour of the park. There’s so much I want to see and know about all the railways!"
Disneyland,fc7ca2i,t1_fc6t52f,1577503240.0,"Dude, that train looks sick! Have so much fun building it!"
Disneyland,fbfv2cd,t3_ed3zb6,1576822047.0,Weirdly forgot that these existed until just now. I wish all the little snow people had names and backstories!
