StarWarsBattlefront,feyfdw7,t1_fey9iem,1579444775.0,"Some people here just hate others having fun. They also see a character that's different and instead of adapting to it, they whine until it gets nerfed so they don't need to change their playstyle. You see it in every game - this one, Overwatch, Team Fortress 2, Rainbow Six: Siege, even Smash Bros.

Plus, Palpatine is one of the only heroes with a unique concept. The rest (until we get the droids) are either saber heroes or blaster heroes with the same weapon mechanics. So the same tactics don't work against him, but people try it anyways. Maybe if OP is having so much trouble killing Palpatine players, the problem lies with them rather than *every* Palpatine player being ""hard to kill."" I've seen Palpatine players that are absolute ass just like I've seen Palpatine players wreck house. 

And if he gets nerfed, OP and the others will complain about something else until that gets nerfed, then something else after that. I don't even play Palpatine because I don't like his playstyle, but all this complaining lately is ridiculous. Between Palpatine, Phasma, and almost every force ability, there'd be nothing left to use if every complaint caused a nerf."

If someone wants to hang out and I don't want to, I just say I'm not feeling top notch and offer to reschedule.

witcher,fe8n9my,t1_fe8jub8,1578928212.0,"Well, Ciri was introduced in the second book, when she was 10. This is where the show's first season ends. The books take place over the course of several years but become more continuous later on in the storyline. The last book ends in 1268, when Ciri would've been 15 or 16.

Given how much happens to her in the books, I'd imagine not only would they not want to televise some of it happening to an underage girl but they'd also be unable to do some of it with an underage actress. So, given the two-year time jump between the second and third book, I believe you're right but also believe that they needed an adult actress. 

I think part of it is that they made her look so young - but still older than in the books - because it'd be easier to make her look younger for one season than older for multiple seasons. I think another part of it is that they wanted an adult actress in order to televise the more mature and graphic parts of the books.

Oh, and it isn't a dumb question! It's my favourite series and I'm so happy to see people taking an interest in it and asking questions :)"

Cringetopia,fdwjqgf,t1_fdwf98k,1578759467.0,"I do concur that proper utilization of words is important - in certain scenarios. Formally, words should absolutely be used correctly and *only* correctly. If somebody used ""literally"" in the same context as the comment above in a formal essay, for example, I'd disagree with that and lose some respect for the piece because it isn't formal.

On social media like Reddit, however, I'm not sure it's so important. Yes, words should be used in full and in fitting situations so people don't end up saying gibberish. However, language evolves over time, especially in the informal context. Meanings of words change. We say ""Yes, you are right"" instead of ""Verily, thou art correct"" because the language has evolved. It wouldn't be wrong, but it would be outdated. Eventually, improper grammar becomes proper. An error in language eventually becomes normal if widespread enough.

That said, I am interested in your point of view and would like you to explain it to me. Maybe you'll change my mind or make me realize I'm incorrect - I'd rather stand corrected than ignorant."

Definition 1 also has a part b that states how the word is used to emphasize the truth of a statement.

Personally I think ""virtually"" would be more appropriate for emphasis than ""literally,"" but using ""literally"" for emphasis rather than to express how literal a statement is, is not grammatically incorrect.

Cringetopia,fdn1wt9,t1_fdm50pt,1578574791.0,"Allow me to preface this by saying I'm not defending nor promoting sexual assault or falsely accusing a person of such a crime. I just have an issue with something you said and would like to discuss it. 

Murder and a ruined life aren't equal. When someone is murdered, their life is ended. Not ruined. They no longer have to deal with any consequences or pain or decisions - in a sense, they're freer than any living person (I'm not advocating death). 

When somebody's life is ruined, they're still alive to suffer through it. They're trapped by the consequences of an action(s) that may or may not have been their own. For example, maybe they got falsely accused of a crime and unjustly lost all the opportunities they could have had; maybe addiction made them homeless and penniless, with irreparable damage to their body and mind; maybe both their parents died when they were young, leaving them with lifelong trauma and no loving guardians; etc.

My point is that somebody with a ruined life can't salvage it or will have great difficulty doing so. Someone who's dead is dead. That's it. Someone with a ruined life will constantly feel pain because they have no opportunities, few or no loved ones, a tarnished reputation, were dealt a bad hand in life, and/or find themselves in an incredibly disadvantaged situation. There's a reason so many people commit suicide instead of dealing with their situation: because many people find no life better than a ruined life. 

So I would not equate a murder victim with someone whose life has been ruined. They're the same in that they have both lost all opportunity and things that could have been, but the key difference is that one is still able to suffer the consequences and pain."

Cops are people too. Most people in a position of service tend to prefer and go easier on a person who treats *them* like a person. Friend was pulled over while I was in the car with her and she was polite to the officer, listened without interrupting him, and cooperated. He let her off with a warning, but if she had been like the other guy and said nothing, treating him like crap, she would've gotten the ticket. Because he seemed very annoyed at first but became more at ease when she didn't act like an asshole.

Now, there's still some stuff you shouldn't do. Like if they ask if you know why they pulled you over, just ask them why instead of answering and risking being wrong and giving them two things to fine you for.

Even if the cop's a dick, arguing with a power-abuser just makes them want to abuse their power even more to make you roll over. Swallow your pride and cooperate if it's something minor like a traffic stop."

Cringetopia,fcui2i4,t1_fcugd5p,1577981467.0,"Judging by their typing style and other comments, I'm pretty sure you're arguing with a 13-year-old. They'll latch onto anything that they think will make them popular or ""normal.""

I say this because when I was 13, nearly a decade ago, that's exactly how I typed. And my 10-year-old brother types the exact same way as well, with less mature and less graphic diction.

I'm convinced most people that age  (12-15) haven't fully developed a capacity for empathy, because that age group is notorious for bullying and morally questionable actions."

Those things are shit for you anyways, but I'm just backing up your point."
im14andthisisdeep,fcpa9ar,t1_fcnmyia,1577855932.0,"Some people - mainly teenagers - think that to be intelligent you must be depressed since you ""see the harsh realities of the world."" They also think it makes you cool or different or something.

As someone with clinical depression, none of that is true. It fucking sucks. It isn't cool, it doesn't make you smart, it doesn't make you ""different"" or quirky. It just means you have an illness and need to treat it. Thinking depression is cool is like thinking diabetes or arthritis is cool.

But that doesn't answer your question at all. You asked *when* it became cool, and while it's no definite answer my personal belief is that it becoming cool correlates with the rise of social media. As for why, I have no idea.

Anyways, Happy New Year, friend!"
wholesomememes,fca9swo,t1_fca70p5,1577565300.0,"You're right. I meant the specific discussion threads. The top comments are usually fine, but it doesn't take long to find a negative comment. They're all cordial though. On the bright side, it's almost an unanimous belief that the casting is good.

I've been a member of the sub for years, I love it."
wholesomememes,fc9a2i8,t1_fc97f02,1577549478.0,"If you go to r/witcher, you'll see people complaining about everything. Right down to the music. Someone made a comment that summed it up nicely, and while I can't remember the exact wording it was something like ""it's almost like you people *want* to hate the show and are finding any excuse to do so. The casting didn't suck like people expected it to so you're struggling to find anything else to complain about.""

People complained about the costume design, and the original costume designer has been replaced, so that problem has been addressed for next season. People are complaining about the writing (which I agree could use improvement), so I'm sure that'll be addressed too.

I read the whole series and it's a pretty faithful adaptation. It takes a liberty here or there and it isn't a line-for-line adaptation, because that's impossible for any book. But like with anything new and popular, people just want to hate it because it's new and popular and ""old is always better"" to them. Plus, some things in a book just don't translate well to a TV screen so need to be changed - like you can't hear a character's thoughts like you can in a book, so an excuse needs to be made for them to talk, like adding a dream sequence or a new character for them to talk to. 

It's a good show. I loved it. Planning on watching it again. It's not perfect but it's nowhere near as terrible as many other Witcher fans are making it out to be."

creepyPMs,fbype46,t1_fbyol9h,1577222837.0,"I concur with your statement. There's no problem with people having different boundaries, the problem is judging OP's boundaries. I did not state my personal beliefs in the stickied post, since I'm trying to stay professional.

However, as a male, I have engaged in platonic cuddling in the past, when I was single. With my female best friend of 4 years, who's been with me through thick and thin, an encouraged me to get help for my severe depression and suicidal thoughts. We have a very deep, strong, and personal friendship, to the point where a romantic attraction was inconceivable and never even crossed our minds.

When two friends have a strong bond like that is when I think platonic affection like cuddling can come into play. It's uncommon and I understand that it's a boundary for most people, since cuddling is traditionally a romantic form of affection.

Anyways, that all said, thank you for expressing your opinion!"

creepyPMs,fbynobe,t3_eexqk5,1577221556.0,"Hey folks. Understandably, most people wouldn't be comfortable with their significant other platonically cuddling a friend of the opposite sex. However, everybody has different boundaries and we're a judgement-free zone for stuff like that.   
Therefore I'm politely requesting you folks to quit the judging of OP platonically cuddling a friend. There's far too much of it and it's against rule 2 of our sub: no victim-blaming, and OP doesn't need to defend her personal relationships. 

Platonic cuddling *is* entirely possible, whether a person believes it is or not. Platonic just means non-sexual, and cuddling isn't sexual. Whether or not you'd be comfortable with your SO doing it is up to you, and your boundaries are valid. But so are OP's boundaries and her boyfriend's boundaries, or lack thereof. Her relationship is *not* the subject of this post. So thank you in advance for you folks respecting her privacy and leaving it alone.

WatchPeopleDieInside,fbymdav,t1_fbyjkv1,1577220591.0,"No need to apologize for the long comment, it was an interesting read and I learned a bit. I appreciate you taking the time to clear up some misconceptions. 

One therapist did teach me a breathing technique, and the others I saw after recommended similar versions of it. They told me to practice it even when I feel fine, and I do. It helps when my anxiety kicks into overdrive or when my temper acts up. As you said, it gives me time to realize I'm about to flip out and that I need a minute of peace to calm down.

What helps me best, personally, is just being alone. My apartment is my ""happy place,"" I guess. I'm at my parents' place for the holidays and have been since Dec. 10, and it's driving me fucking nuts. My siblings are so much younger than me and never, ever leave me alone for more than 30 minutes and it's always so noisy here. Anyways, I digress.

A lot of your comment actually applies to me, and it was quite encouraging honestly. Thank you."

If I do play games to relax, I try to pick something non-competitive and non-violent. I especially like puzzle ones. But I read a lot and practice my guitar as well. I try to balance out everything so that I'm not getting too much of one thing.

And Merry Christmas to you too!"
WatchPeopleDieInside,fby0jb2,t1_fbxygi5,1577205167.0,"Thank you, this is an insightful comment. I do play guitar and a gym membership is included in my student fees, so those are two ideas you've given me.

I've not tried yoga but I've tried meditation and it just didn't do anything for me. I never thought of recharging in the same way as you've laid it out here, and it's given me some stuff to think about. Videogames are a big habit of mine and always have been, so I've only considered the stressful, competitive games to be sources of anxiety or more stress. I guess I haven't really considered how calmer games may have a negative effect as well.

Again, thank you for that, I appreciate your comment and it's actually inspired me to do some thinking."
