HeadphoneAdvice,feqefwt,t1_feqcw1j,1579340868.0,"Hey thanks for the detailed comment. You are talking about sennheiser momentum true wireless right? How about Momentum 2.0? They (especially the ivory one) look pretty neat IMO and can be a good present. Do you think over the ear can sound better with ANC over in-ear versions? I can't help but think the true wireless is a marketing-oriented product with APP controls, fancy leds, in box charging etc. Any hype is irrelevant when it comes to audio I think. For example I have been using Beyerdynamic DT 770s for a while and they will still serve pretty good even after 10 years. So I don't want to give in to a marketing strategy. Also 4 hours is pretty low and I am sure it will get drained over time. So maybe Momentum 2.0 can make more sense?"
HeadphoneAdvice,feq3p1m,t1_feq2aqu,1579337221.0,"Yeah exactly the thing is his family was considering buying him Sennheiser Momentum Wireless headphones when they contacted me as I know a thing or two about music production. So I am basically trying to be a mediator between the family making the purchase and my audiophile friend, which is a tough position to be in. Anyways I might just back off and let them buy that wireless headphone nonesense. At least it will not be on me."
