Yes, if your mom removes her name from the assets, which can be done, then she could become ""judgement proof"". They could get a judgement but never get paid a dime from it. Your Dad would not be impacted.

Partial payments will eventually lead to default, just may take twice as long to get to the point of default.

After default, making any payment will probably make them less in a hurry to sue you.

Only your mom credit should get ruined. However, if they do sue, they gave attach liens to every asset that has your mom's name on it (which may then cause an impact to your Dad)
