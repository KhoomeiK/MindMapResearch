sugarfree,fftdjn1,t3_ev1a9t,1580217362.0,"Quit it right away.  If chocolate milk is your main sugar addiction, I’d switch to plain fat free fairlife milk and add artificial sweetener and cocoa powder or Hershey’s sugar free chocolate syrup.  Have this for awhile whenever you have your chocolate milk craving.  It has a lot less sugar than regular chocolate milk and might probably end up satisfying you more in the long run.  Just make sure you wait about 45 minutes after drinking it so that your body has time to digest the protein.  You won’t get the same rush from it that you get from sugary chocolate milk because there isn’t a lot of sugar in it, this is also why it isn’t addictive.  Also, make sure that if this is the main switch that you make, that you don’t start trying to still get your sugar fix from something else.  Don’t even add fruit or carrots if it’s something you wouldn’t normally have, it’s not that these things are that bad for you, but you’re trying to kick an addiction.  The couple of grams of sugar (6g) in the fairlife milk should also keep you from completely falling apart."
