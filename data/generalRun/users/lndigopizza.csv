ScarySigns,ff5i67p,t3_erjn05,1579593985.0,At the kangaroo farm in my city there’s a sign that has to tell people not to box the kangaroos because they (the kangaroos) will essentially kick your ass.

It makes for easier pouring and more juice, but if it doesn’t have a second handle then I can imagine why it would be poorly designed; especially heavier juice containers I usually need to grip those handles with my fingers fully or else it hurts to carry them."

As for how I’ve been dealing with my insomnia these days... Not very well, unfortunately. I just take a bunch of diphenhydramine pills every night and it kind of does the trick. Not healthy I know, and I don’t recommend it, but I have a few issues when it comes to pills."

JusticeServed,feyoeds,t1_fexs3r2,1579448243.0,"Honestly tardive dyskinesia can manifest in a very short time on antipsychotics, unfortunately. That’s something that I wish my doctor had told me before he prescribed a medium dose of an antipsychotic for my insomnia. I was on that shit for 2 years before another doctor finally recognized the symptoms. I was 17 years old when I was diagnosed with it, I had seen so many doctors for it and yet not a single one of them postulated that maybe the poison I was taking could have been fucking with my brain. I couldn’t control my face, my arms, my hands, none of it. The doctor that figured it out told me he never, ever prescribes antipsychotics unless it’s an absolute last resort, and even then never for more than 2 weeks at a time. They told me it might go away since I was under 25 and my brain hadn’t fully developed, well I’m 20 and I still have it. It’s fucking nasty, I can’t do something as simple as write anymore unless I use a brace and even then I can’t do curved lines, I write in all caps. I had to give up my dream of being a brain surgeon, that ones obvious lmao. I tried my hand at animation since I have a passion for art, but again I have to use a special brace and even then my lines are sloppy. I was told straight to my face that the animation industry doesn’t have time for people like me. It’s just really sad, and so often overlooked. No one ever talks about it, but we really should. If there had been more awareness about this sort of thing before I had been prescribed what I had been given, I could have turned it down. And the amount of doctors that disclose it is abysmal. I went back to the hospital this June, a new psychiatrist tried to prescribe me antipsychotics and I turned him down outright and told him why. He didn’t seem surprised, and I just think that’s downright deplorable. How could a doctor in good conscience ever prescribe what is essentially poison to a person when they know the risks... I wish it had never happened to me."
