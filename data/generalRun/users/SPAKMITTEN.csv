Do you know the story of Niki Lauda and the Boeing 767 thrust reversers?

The short version is that a plane operated by Lauda Air, Niki's airline, crashed because of the in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser, a mechanism on the engines that redirected engine thrust to slow the plane. The plane was at 400 knots, and 30,000 feet, when one of the thrust reversers deployed. The cockpit voice recorder pointed to the reverser deployment being uncommanded by the flight crew.

Boeing tried to downplay the incident and say that a thrust reverser deployment was recoverable*, blaming pilot error. Niki bullied Boeing into getting access to their simulator at Gatwick airport, in which he ran simulations of the incident. He was unable to recover after the reverser deployment. Boeing didn't budge.

Then Niki said ""Okay. If it's a recoverable incident I'll take one of my pilots, and my 767s, and we'll intentionally deploy a thrust reverser mid-flight. I'll call the media, make a big show of it. If it's recoverable, than everything should be fine."" Someone at Boeing must have known that Lauda was crazy enough to actually do it and put out a statement stating that the flawed design was responsible for the crash.

This incident, and the issues surrounding the lack of positive interlocks on thrust reversers, were almost swept under the rug, and likely would have been if it wasn't for Niki Lauda. If it weren't for him there would have likely been another crash caused by reverser deployment, but because of him the FAA mandated positive interlocks that stopped the reversers from being opened unless the landing gear was extended, and the issue never caused another accident.

EDIT: Added some elaboration on how full of shit Boeing's response was.

* It isn't, and I can't find the words to describe how insane of an assertion that is. Imagine being in a 4WD car, cruising down the highway, when, suddenly and inexplicably the wheels on the driver's side going at 70% speed in reverse. One second everything is fine, cruising along, the next you have zero control and you're spinning like a top. ""Unplanned thrust reversal deployment"" isn't something you train for, it's nearly inconceivable that a pilot could have even diagnosed the problem, let alone fixed it, and it's pure fantasy that it would be fixed fast enough to allow the pilot time to recover the plane."
