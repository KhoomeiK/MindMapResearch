Earth is flat. Fact. Space is not flat. Fact. Earth is not rigidly flat - it conforms to the curvature of space. This curvature connects one side of the planet to the other. Because you could traverse the earth endlessly by going in a straight line, it is easy to then assume you must be going in a circle. Because we know for a fact that the Earth is flat - this can be best explained by describing Earth as a mobius strip. 


Ok, well what if somebody moves perpendicular to its center line? Wouldn't they encounter the border? Yes, in theory this is correct and what many Flat Earth scientists search for. However, this fails to account for the near infinite folds of space in our local solar cluster. The earth is a mobius strip with a possibly infinite number if paradromic rings. (Log(r)sin(1/2 *ø))^n-1 for the visual. 


This is also why the misconception exists that the Sun is at the center of the solar system, when once you account for the bends in space - its evident that Earth is at the center."

It is cheap, tastes better after frozen, and bland AF (so toss it in something you like). 


Homemade hummus has good protein in it, it's good in lieu of peanut butter if you want protein and to keep lower(ish) cals (a lot of the premade stuff I notice is pretty low compared to just instant potting a bag of chick peas). 

Pumpkin Seeds are a good item. Like most nuts and seeds, good protein but high(er) calories. 

Coke's milk products, Fairlife, are one of the better ones for protein/calories. It's good too. Some Soy/nut milks also are good at protein,  and most will have a better nutritional profile than milk. 


Sausage fake meats are a maybe. Field Roast Sausages are surprisingly good cal::protein, but the high sodium and processed foods part may be a turn off. Though this may be comparable to a lower quality sausage.


Beans and legumes come up - and it's good, but also super easy to get burnt out on. So it's good to change it up. I try to rarely make beans the focus of a dish - when I do, it's something like chili, or a bean burrito. 


Obv. Protein powder. I found Garden of Life to be one of my favorites taste wise. Gotta be with milk or fake milks, not water.

AskReddit,fckke2d,t1_fck94sr,1577727241.0,"If you recently stopped, I'd reccomend two books: Becoming Vegan and The China Study.

Becoming Vegan is more of a reference book, and reads sort of like an encyclopedia or dictionary.

It is a very well referenced work. 

The China Study is just a good diet book that goes over the collective results of many studies based on animal protein consumption and breaks down the whole ""protein"" thing pretty well. It isnt a vegan book, but does come to the conclusion that the reader should cut down meat consumption. I cant remember if it was this one, or the follow up that talked more about substitutes...

If anything, it provides for a great occasional dish to a vegetarian or vegan diet. Many of then have actually gotten good too. 


The ""fake"" meats are all still relatively new.

This does not mean a player must emulate the game as this shirt suggests. This does not mean that a game will cause every player to shoot up a public place. It just means games affect players.


Games can have a positive impact on players. Games like Celeste, Journey, Undertale, and Bastion are all praised on reddit for their story and when they came out, subs were filled with posts about mental health and the positive impacts the game had. (Except Fuck Celeste C tapes).


Games can be an expressive media, a way to bring people together online, a stress relief or an adrenaline rush, or simply an escapist mechanism. The influence of games can be felt past just the player. Like it or not, Fornite dances are a great example of a positive impact. Sure, some may find it annoying - but unless you're the villain from Footloose, dancing is hardly a negative influence of the game. 


Games can also have a negative impact. Every online gamer has experienced the toxic player who rages and screams at every mistake and harasses their team (""GG this fucking jungler sucks""). The ridiculous state if in-game transactions and mystery boxes has garnered immense scrutiny from the gaming community as well as national bodies. 


MMOs, Mobile games, and Pay-to-Win styled games are designed to use the right carrots to keep the player engaged and ""addicted"" to their product. The quintessential WoW ""ding"" comes to mind. MMOs provide seemingly unlimited grind content (which many players want), but an MMO player likely knows (or is) that one player who never seems to get off - that got sucked in.


Even old games had an impact. Ever heard of Tetris Syndrome? 


Please, let's get out of this notion that video games do not impact their players. Video games are an immersive and interactive media that are sometimes good, and sometimes bad. Some people can take a loss, others cant. Some people can play casually, others cant. 


Maybe it is disproportionate to other forms of media, maybe not. But games DO impact and influence people."
