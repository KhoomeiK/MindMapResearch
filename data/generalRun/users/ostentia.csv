If you think like that, you should never do anything ever. Staying home alone with the kids is dangerous because you could have a heart attack and die. It's not even safe to stay home with your partner and the kids because you could *both* have a heart attack and die. Come to think, you probably shouldn't even be home at all because what if a home invader breaks in and murders all of you? But it's not safe to be in public either, because a gunman could decide to lay siege on wherever you are at literally any given moment. And how would you even get out in public anyway? Your car could explode. It's not even safe to sit in your locked basement, surrounded by provisions, because your house could collapse.

Something can *always* go wrong, no matter what you're doing. You can't allow yourself to live in fear of unlikely things like a robber or a medical emergency during a brief visit to the post office. That's no way to live a life. Take reasonable precautions, obviously, but you've got to live your life around those precautions."
