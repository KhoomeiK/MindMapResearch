I felt it was missing the sense of dread from the first one where you have no idea what's going on and you're on this hostile compound where everything is trying to kill you for some reason. In the second one I never actually felt hunted or threatened. Hell, I felt like more of a threat than the environment. But I liked the gameplay and weapons a lot."
