When you start showing symptoms of rabies, you will die. There has been 1 person who has lived past this point. Rabies kills so fucking effectively and is the most horrific way to die in my book. Your body straight up refuses to take in water and you slowly lose your mind while becoming so intensely dehydrated that all of your organs fail and you die screaming and sputtering like a madman because your brain is a pink ball of meat at this point."

Couple that with his excellent production quality, and the occasional crazy good rhyme or hook, and you can understand how he is as revered as he is. However, most of his stuff is just . . . meh.

You literally came to the conclusion you sought yourself. He is a content creator. He has his own resource to ask questions, *and to ask questions that his audience may also have*. If you have ever wondered something, but not enough to do any research with it, and you see something asking this question for you, you would be in a better position to ask, those same questions again and try to find the answers yourself. As a content creator, his goal is to get views by saying things he thinks in a way that gets his audience interested. If he thinks that being a nazi is the best thing on earth, he isnt gonna say that because that wont do anything but hurt his reputation that he has with his audience."

If you are assuming that the vast majority of people who have questions are ""bad faith actors"" then I cant help you because that's some insane paranoia. Secondly, I dont know how long you've been watching wubby but your take on both his content and his character are strangely ignorant.


There is no reason to assume what he is doing is acting in bad faith because it is just as likely that he had never found himself in a position of exposure to *this* aspect of trans culture. Interestingly enough, you would find that Wubby's views on Transgenerism are very consistent, boiling down to ""adults should have full control of their bodies and lives"" which he addresses not only in this video, but in his video on ""theybies"", and on his stream *less than 3 hours after this video was posted*. And in that stream on twitch, he spent a solid hour asking his audience to help him understand the mindset, and got several replies from trans people in his community that helped him understand. 


His content is largely making fun of people, but it's always target at either a.) People who are taking advantage of others or b.) People who are off their rocker (ie the lady dating a ghost). If you took the time to watch his stuff, youd find that, while his older stuff is much more edgy and much more aggressive, he has grown as a personality and uses his platform to expose the wrongdoings of others on the platform, or the strange things he finds on YouTube."
