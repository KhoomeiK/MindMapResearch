bigboobproblems,fgkk0hc,t3_ez0fzl,1580867349.0,"I'm sorry you're having such a difficult time with this, body dysmorphia is really tough. I had an eating disorder in high school up until I was 22. After I quit smoking and repaired my relationship with food I gained 35lbs. I went from 118 to 155, I'm 5'4"". I still feel like I need to be skinny, and when I look at myself in the mirror I hate my body. My boobs are huge for my body frame and they just me look heavier than I am. They are also not perky like everyone just assumes boobs are - even large ones - due to porn and plastic surgery. They are also bell shaped (less full on the top, heavier on the bottom) and not the more desired round or tear drop shape the media likes. 

But it's my body, no matter what it looks like. It might not be the one I would have chosen for myself, but it's the one I got, and it does some pretty amazing things for me that  I appreciate daily. 

In high school I was a 34D before my ED, I slowly transitioned into a 36D then I became a 38D when I was 23... I am now a 38DDD... when I was at the height of my ED I was something like a 32C wearing a size 3-4 in pants

I don't know what your baseline bra size is but you've lost several band sizes! That's something to be proud of!

It sometimes takes a bit to get rid of fat in some places and not others. You can't do one specific excercise to get rid fat in a one particular area, you lose a little bit everywhere. 

Continue what you're doing and see if you don't see anymore changes. You're doing great."

It also helps others find their stuff too if you have the app installed by using yours to make the gps location stronger.

Frugal,fghyo9x,t1_fghx7co,1580798145.0,"Do you know if your neighbors drink or use their tap? 

Brita is safe for the average tap, it probably wouldn't do much if you had lead issues but if you regularly take showers or baths in your apartment bathroom you should be okay on that front.

If you're still concerned you can talk to your landlord or city. 

You can choose from a variety of different filters, Brita is just the one that comes to mind. They have jugs you can put water into and they have attachments that fit right onto your sink. They also have videos testing the filter for impurities for what it's worth to you. What I've found is that Purfied drinking water IS better, it has fewer impurities - by a lot. But a filter is the next best thing.

 I'd hate for you to be spending so much on water jugs and then not be able to use it..."
Frugal,fghtwsx,t3_eykqoe,1580793750.0,How much and how often are you buying jugs of water? It may be worth it to just buy a water filtration system like Brita and just use your tap. They range between $18-$27.

povertyfinance,ffz1x7t,t3_ew058y,1580361316.0,"Call the credit companies and explain your situation, ask them to excuse payments for a few months or lower your interest rates for a period of time. They sometimes will work with you if in situations of lost jobs, hardships, etc. 

The fact that you aren't delinquent on your payments helps your case. 


Another tip is that if you make a payment on your due date and then later that month make a larger payment, it will (read: sometimes) throw off the credit card calculations - they'll send you a notice saying there's an issue and you don't have to make a payment on next month's bill... effectly eliminating a potential interest increase that month."

Like, I think Kaiser is absolutely terrible - but I had a great family doctor there, as well as some really judgmental and ill-practiced nurses. 

With my new insurance, I have a semi okay doctor, and the urgent care doctors are all terrific. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that: go ahead and switch insurances, but that won't solve your doctor issues. It's a problem that happens at any hospital with any insurance company."

> people should be looking for the person they'd be willing to sacrifice for not for one that can provide them with something

I don't want my relationship to be about sacrificing anything.

You come into this world by yourself, you leave it by yourself. You get one life to do with as you please. 

Relationships should be about growing together and walking through life together, understanding each other as individuals and making important decisions together. Respecting each other, and caring for the other. Challenging each other to be the best versions of yourselves. 

Perhaps ""Sacrifice"" is subjective. The way you put it, it sounds like a the only good relationship is one where you suffer (sacrifice) for a desired outcome (healthy relationship)... which is so bizarre to me. And feels like such a dreary way to live one's life, from my perspective anyway. 

I'm a whole person, a partner should add to my life, not subtract from it. 

If a discussion is had about a particular subject which requires action on either of our parts, it should feel like the missing piece of a puzzle. It shouldn't feel as if I'm subtracting anything in order to preserve a relationship. 

Relationships are hard, because they require communication and commitment. You definitely should consider what you can get out of a relationship with another person as you can acquire both positive and negative things from someone else, and I'm not talking about money or sex."

People do mood trackers for all sorts of different things, not just to ""aim at being happy""

I also work at a place where art is the main objective of their business, and I am required to have absolutely no tattoos on show. 

I'm happy for your wife that she's found a great place in UCSD that allows her to be herself. But that's anecdotal, and not indicative of what may happen to OP's sister.
