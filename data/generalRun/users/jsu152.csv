But when he woke from the procedure, he was informed that there had been complications and the surgeon had brought in another specialist to help out. That additional doctor was not a member of our health plan so despite my friend's careful planning, he got a big, unexpected bill anyway."

AskReddit,febkj05,t3_eo4n70,1578959754.0,"There are pictures of every object, planet and life form in the universe that has or will ever exist (and at every angle, magnification, and even moment in time). They can all be viewed on your phone (with a special app). How? Well, every digital image boils down to a number (the digit count is based on the resolution). There is a finite range of numbers for each resolution, so we already have access to every possible image that could ever be taken, in the past, present and future. When quantum computing becomes a thing, working out the ""right"" numbers will become possible."

Change them and it will create chaos. Higher numbers would be the worst. Even easier: expose bank login/passwords and let online thieves drain people's accounts on a vast scale, overwhelming customer support systems and causing economic disruption.
