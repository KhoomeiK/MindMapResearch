I saw in my preliminary research that the surgery costs about 20-30,000 out of pocket. So 10% could be 2000-3000-- but most places will certainly set up a payment plan for this.

I also work in a school! I only had to take 2 weeks off, and just had to be careful lifting any more than 20lbs for the first week back (per my surgeon's instruction).

Ahhh! 

I'm a little excited. I was 286 on the day of the surgery and until about two and a half weeks ago I had only gone down to 282! I was stuck in a stall and at my 4 week follow up I asked if that was normal. My surgeon assured me it was, my body was just healing and adjusting.

Wednesday night (this week) I stepped on the scale to see I'm down to 273. 

I'm in the same boat as you, I don't eat much at all--- I stay hydrated and I eat three protein heavy ""meals"" but they're probably still between a quarter cup and maybe a third. I do try for 5-6 small meals but that seems impossibly right now. I also try to drink Fairlife Milk just so I have a little more protein as liquids go down so easily! (Seriously; I can drink 30 Oz in 45 minutes to an hour) But eating is tough, usually i quit halfway through a serving because I feel like I ""swallowed a wet sock"" as someone brilliantly put it elsewhere and feel icky for the next 45 minutes. Which just makes me want to eat even less. But, I know I'm eating more than I was last week and the week before, and it's certainly way easier than it was during purÃ©es... so I know I'll get there, and I just keep doing my best every day. 

I've got to say, I'm wearing a lot of the things I was wearing the month before surgery.. so I didn't see too much of a difference.. but really it's because I wasn't trying smaller sizes on. Turns out I'm not a 2xl or XL, but a men's large right now. In fact I tried to replace a shirt today and got it a size smaller and it's still too baggy! I swear this felt like it happened over two weeks lol.

Good luck!! You're killing it! It's just a slow first month or so, but I hear it really kicks up around month 3!

Edit: Also, just saw you're just starting solids! (I began about two weeks ago) I have to say, moving from soft foods to cleared for ""real"" food also made all the difference it seemed. I felt way more like myself once I was able to."

I did overdo sugar last week (had a latte early in the day and then later had fun size pack of M&Ms at a Christmas party while on my period) and experienced my first (and hopefully) only night of Dumping.

My point is, calm down. I don't think we need to rush to emotional abuse, this is pretty mild. He shakes a tree, pretends to steal it and stomps around for less than a minute before leaving. I think the kids will be okay. I'm also pretty sure that there's only one crying, so I don't think they're quite as terrified as you may think. The older ones probably also think it's funny, and the parents probably didn't set this up just to traumatize them and ""emotionally abuse"" them; they probably set it up for some fun.

As someone who suffered emotional and physical abuse at the hands of my mother for years, even withholding me from seeing psychiatrists when my bipolar symptoms started to emerge and get out of control... I don't think having a character from a story (and three movies) that 90% of kids know and love, come stomp around your house counts as emotional abuse.

Edit: 2 kids are crying and I'm pretty sure the rest are smiling or staring on in disbelief."

I just want one or two to survive the family party."
