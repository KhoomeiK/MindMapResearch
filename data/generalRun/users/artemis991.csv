lonely,ff9319c,t3_es5iv4,1579703616.0,Im so glad i found this thread. I thought it was just me who did this. I do it so much it and i always feel so pitiful after. Like I have a whole other life in my head that probably will never become real in any way shape or form. I have conversations with myself all the time. I just feel like no one cares enough to listen.
bisexual,fet7zwy,t1_fet5rxo,1579372589.0,Same. I rarely ever come out to people. The last time i did they tried to tell me what being bisexual is since i said im more attracted to females than males. Its so stressful not having people understand you. The internet is a lifesaver when you feel like ur alone.
bisexual,fereduz,t1_fepux39,1579352924.0,That is so true. Just recently i started over coming depression so i may give something bi or lgbt a try soon.
bisexual,ferddcf,t1_fepv2gy,1579352610.0,You know i think about that all the time lol
bisexual,fepui68,t1_fepu2hz,1579331777.0,I agree. I thought about going to one of the clubs in my state but changed my mind. I dont really have much of a social circle anymore. Depression tends to remove friends from ur life. I also feel better coming on here and talking to people who i can relate too.
bisexual,feptn0m,t1_feps0u0,1579330871.0,Not really and i don't do the whole LGBT community thing. B might be in there but its not always respected.
depression,fd2vh4u,t3_ejnao7,1578152016.0,I dont feel bad i just feel like no one cares. I mean everyone around me calls me lazy because for a long time i could not get out of bed. So if theyre calling me lazy when i just dont have the energy i feel like talking about my depression wont be understood or cared about at all.
lonely,fcymgid,t3_ejdv3s,1578082740.0,I hate when that happens. It just reminds me of how im not a thought on anyones mind.
lonely,fcr2hbq,t1_fcqm7l4,1577895823.0,Yea i do. I spend ALL of my free time with them. Sometimes i need a break.
lonely,fcpbora,t1_fcpa6ug,1577857384.0,I just told him i want a divorce. Forget him. He doesnt support me and my mental health. Hes been so mean to me over the years and my depression kept me here. I saw the light and im done with him. He knows i no longer live him. Im also drunk so that divorce announcement was prematuure
lonely,fcp67wj,t1_fcp5l7d,1577851804.0,Well that sucks! Ill have two for u and i hope 2020 will be 10 times better for the both of us!
lonely,fcp4so0,t3_eia4jo,1577850467.0,I was just sitting here in my car thinking the same thing. Everyones out having fun and i wasnt even a thought on anyones mind. Not one invite to anything. Ill just get drunk at home alone.
MarriedAndBi,fcn8mzm,t1_fcjzxlw,1577806102.0,I have a therapist. Thats why ive come to this decision. Thank you and i hope it is too.
depression,fcmefe6,t3_ehvaqw,1577772265.0,We are in the same exact boat.
MarriedAndBi,fcmeatn,t1_fcm3qgd,1577772141.0,I came out to my husband and he told me im going to hell so theres that. Its dysfunctional and im tired of it. Im in the middle of coming out of a deep depression and hes no help at all. You are 100% correct the happiness of myself and the kids are more important than trying to make this work. I cant keep my urges secret anymore to be honest. Im trying to wait until i end my marriage but its hard when theres someones interested.
MarriedAndBi,fcklejk,t1_fck6dms,1577727870.0,I have a therapist. This relationship has been over for a while. I was trying because of the kids. I am tired of trying to get him to be a parent. I dont even want to get into details about my relationship but im done. Ive thought on it and slept on it. Ive talked to my therapist. My happiness and my kids happiness are more important to me then trying to make something work that contributes to my depression. I didnt give any back story on my marriage. So no one has the full story.
latebloomerlesbians,fcjhm6d,t3_eh6lho,1577687913.0,Im always having sex dreams about women. I havent been with a woman in over 10yrs. Im married with kids now. The dreams drive me crazy because theyre only dreams and i need them to become reality lol.
MarriedAndBi,fcjh116,t1_fcjgiux,1577687290.0,Im not rushing things. Ive been thinking about divorce for a while. Its just some things i wont put up with forever. He isnt going to change and hes not good for my mental health. My happiness is more important than this marriage.
depression,fcjg395,t3_eh9up7,1577686310.0,Ive felt like u for over a year. My kids keep me going. Nothing seems to get any better no matter how hard i try but i just think about my kids and how it would hurt them. I just keep pushing with what little hope i have left.
lonely,fc7j52s,t1_fc7h9x2,1577509065.0,"No i've found that when people jokingly say things like that its the truth. I always say why hang out with people u hate and never actually liked. It makes you a little crazy thinking about why so many friendships dont work out. I always just think its just me and im not likable but someone responded to my post and it made so much sense. Its a long post but i suggest u read it. It might help u feel better about this situation. It would feel a whole lot better if people just said ""hey i dont want to be friends anymore. Heres why..."""
lonely,fc7had0,t1_fc7dpt1,1577507412.0,No thats not the way to handle it. It wont be revenge. They might be sad for a second  but they will still go on to treat others the same way.
lonely,fc7h45a,t1_fc7cko6,1577507262.0,"I feel like thats the worst part. When people stop talking to u out of no where and u dont even know why. It leaves u wondering whats wrong with me or what did i do wrong. None of my cousins hang out with me and my ""best friend"" just ignores me now. I shouldve learned my lesson with that person though. He did that once in high school when i guess he found better people to hang out with. Then when him and one of the girls fell out all of a sudden he wanted to hang out again."
lonely,fc7gvx2,t1_fc7bhqx,1577507064.0,Thats how ive always felt. I just stopped going out all together. Its a waste of time and it makes me feel shity. People will invite me last minute knowing i wont be abke to make it. I guess it makes it seem like they made an effort to include me.
lonely,fc7grph,t1_fc72eri,1577506961.0,I was just thinking about going to some things going on in the city next month but i just say never mind. Its honestly no fun going to festivals and bars alone. It makes me feel worse because i see the groups of friends that came together and it gets to me. Like i would like just one close friend with the same interest as me that i can hang out with.
lonely,fc7gldx,t1_fc6whmv,1577506809.0,Thank you for your response. It sounds like we grew up with similar households. Ive cut everyone out of my life that has made me feel invisible. I finally deleted loads of numbers out of my phone. Ive just started my clean up project. I feel good that i got rid of those toxic friends but now i see how alone i really am in this world.
lonely,fc6aegm,t1_fc64kw0,1577475970.0,Im not okay. I feel alone. My christmas was ok. Didnt do much. I dont care for holidays much since my dad died.
depression,fc4qxdz,t1_fc4pxmg,1577425180.0,"Thank you for those kind words! I dont feel amazing though. Ive been working on my list of goals which has been helping with my depression but these set backs like my car, financial struggles, relationship struggles, and work just make it hard to keep going. I just wish i didnt exist. All i do is struggle. Nothing seems to get better."
lonely,fc1ymld,t1_fc1xp6r,1577333836.0,They are all of a sudden busy but theyre hanging out with the same people i included in my invite on their IG stories. I just cut everyone off to see if anyone would reach out and if they didnt ill reach out just to see what the response is. Thats when i realize i have no one.
bisexual,e6iskft,t1_e6ihvlf,1537748401.0,I don’t even go to LGBT people because we are the B but the community doesnt accept bisexuals as much people think. Lesbian woman get mad when they find out I’m bi. They just disregard me all together. It does suck. It sucks a lot. I have so many things regarding my sexuality and no one to talk to who understands. My husband tries to talk to me about it but it’s weird sometimes to talk about attractions i have at work to other females. I just don’t talk about it at all with him anymore. It’s so hard to tell who’s bi and who’s not because we’re least likely to come out.
