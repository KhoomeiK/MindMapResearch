AskReddit,fefves0,t1_fefo149,1579066453.0,"I think the reason bad Apple firefighters and paramedics don’t seem to effect the public’s perception is not the media’s rate of coverage but rather the fact that they seem to get punished more or less just like anybody else who is caught committing a crime, maybe even more harshly. A firefighter who is caught setting fires or a paramedic who is caught harming a patient is considered scum of the earth who has broken a sacred oath and nobody really cares why they did it. Police who do questionable things may or may not be held accountable in a way that feels like justice to the public which can create a negative sentiment towards the entire profession. Media coverage is sometimes the full extent of their repercussion for questionable behavior. If accountability was consistent and transparent, people would likely be more open to believing that a particular misbehaving cop is the exception rather than the rule."
AskReddit,fefn0wy,t1_fefmcsb,1579059872.0,"Well, if that’s actually what’s happened then you’re right. It’s being drowned out by a much, much larger ongoing story. You seem to be focused on news coverage which is social awareness but not a measure of justice. my question is do you feel like these arsonist firefighters are routinely escaping judicial punishment once their behavior is discovered? If so I would like to see some type of reporting from any source about an arsonist firefighter who was discovered and faced little to no consequence."
AskReddit,fefm1xm,t1_feflj5s,1579059233.0,"I’m not in Australia so I can’t speak to coverage. All I know about Australia is that a lot of it is on fire and a lot of brave firefighters (and others) are putting it on the line to try to get a handle on it. But if it turned out an arsonist fire fighter started the bushfires that would be a pretty big story, but it wouldn’t offset the hundreds if not thousands of fire fighters who did the right thing. It takes a lot of wrong doing to taint a largely altruistic field."
AskReddit,fefkdpz,t3_eowfco,1579058179.0,"Bc bad cops, however rare you believe them to be, have a more immediate and profound impact on the lives of the people and communities they effect. If arsonist firefighters and angel of death paramedics were more common, people would distrust them as well."
wholesomememes,fdwlns0,t1_fdtw750,1578759942.0,Skeedaddle makes me think of that Tom and Jerry noise implying urgency but no true threat. Scram makes me think of a group of kids who’ve just done something they shouldn’t have who now feel a threat is imminent.
wholesomememes,fdwkff4,t1_fdu1bzr,1578759637.0,I would agree with this. But how far away do we really think these two are going?
