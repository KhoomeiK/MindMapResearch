As for BMTDK, well we do know that David was interested in death pretty much through his whole career, he alludes to it frequently. It's really very normal to become inreasingly aware of one's mortality as you get older."
DavidBowie,fexlcsn,t3_eqtvr6,1579432878.0,"Haywood Jones should have survived his illness, he should have been admitted to hospital and received proper nursing care. David Jones had a heart 'attack' at the age of 57 because he'd abused his body from childhood. (it would have been more surprising if he hadn't had any kind of illness).

He was also experimenting with cut ups at the time, so I wouldn't try to make too much sense out of it. Just one more reference, Marc Bolan of TRex (David's close friend), referred to him and David as The diamond dogs in one of his songs. Marc seems to be  a constant theme in David's work."
DavidBowie,ferdvc7,t3_eqfr2g,1579352716.0,"There wasn't really anything to see, because he wasn't there all the time. He just popped up looking different now and again. I can remember seeing Ziggy Stardust, Golden years, and Heroes on TV, and publicity for The man who fell to earth, but I'm not sure if I was aware it was the same person all the time. I don't think there was any real sense of a career progression at the time, and I don't think people really analysed his characters.

tifu,fdqr3v0,t1_fdmtrav,1578673078.0,"You mean you've only heard of him having a sexual encounter with Mick Jagger.

Are you actually a Bowie fan? Surely you've heard of Lyndsey Kemp then, a gay man who said he had a sexual and romantic relationship with David Bowie in 1967. And Calvin Mark Lee, the man who David and Angie were both dating? I could go on...

He really didn't pretend to be gay because it was 'trendy', what rubbish."
DavidBowie,fdqbdq3,t1_fdqaie3,1578661982.0,"'Hair wrong'. You can never say that about Bowie. He had so many different styles and colours, anything is possible. We really need some authenticated photos from 1988 (not Glass spider) to compare."
DavidBowie,fdpzz1g,t1_fdpz014,1578648047.0,"The timing is wrong. If it had been dated 1978 or 1983 I would have said yes, it is him, because there are photos from those periods where he looks very similar.

It is difficult to be sure sometimes with candid or amateur photos of him, when he isn't being 'David Bowie'. He liked to not be recognised when he was on his own time so he looked more ordinary."
DavidBowie,fdpvv0m,t3_emgpsf,1578642633.0,"1977, loved Low and Heroes."
DavidBowie,fdpvqr8,t1_fdpp49n,1578642492.0,"I don't think he was. He said that phase only lasted about a week (from writing Word on a wing). He did wear a cross on a chain, but that was for sentimental reasons as it had belonged to his dad."
OldSchoolCool,fdn3axx,t1_fdn2f3i,1578576031.0,"It's really just a reverse of the usual joke when someone posts a photo of their Mom or Grandma with a male celebrity, plenty of posts about them fucking and the celebrity is their real dad. It works because Bowie was known to be bi."
OldSchoolCool,fdn2dib,t1_fdn1oq2,1578575215.0,Alright then. Why though?
OldSchoolCool,fdn1jfw,t1_fdmzkap,1578574449.0,"I was just going on what Angela said. The police were very strict on crowd control and kept a big space between the fans and the stage. Maybe that was just one gig though.

I'm definitely not disbelieving your friends Dad . There was a rumour that he had a boyfriend in Japan around this time and he wanted to bring him back to the US/Uk but his manager talked him out of it."
OldSchoolCool,fdmzijh,t1_fdmwohr,1578572466.0,Crowd surfing in Japan? Sounds unlikely. Good story though. Bowie always said he had a thing for Asian guys.
DavidBowie,fdmu4ms,t1_fdmlfrc,1578565887.0,"Yeah, he dropped that part when he performed it by himself."
DavidBowie,fdmu2y4,t3_em1e39,1578565825.0,"I think it had two main themes, looking back over the '70s, and his ongoing addiction to cocaine (and possibly other drugs as well)."

DavidBowie,fdln3js,t1_fdlj2tz,1578527772.0,"I thought it was more likely to be 1983. I did think of those photos and actually I can see a resemblance there. Other possibility is it's not the guy's dad, he found the photo somewhere and guessed the year wrong. I know he used to visit Greece sometimes so that part matches up. Oh I love these little Bowie mysteries."
DavidBowie,fdkxied,t1_fdkm6ui,1578513195.0,I know. It's almost as funny as the comment thread on the Dancing in the street vid on youtube.

DavidBowie,fdk7rbn,t3_elsrt5,1578498011.0,"The best version was on the Dick Cavett show. It would have been perfect if not for David overdoing the 'refreshments' beforehand, which really affected his voice. Personally I thought the version at the start of the medley on The Cher show was absolutely fantastic, such a shame they had  to segue into the medley (though bits of that were quite good as well)."
EatCheapAndHealthy,fdjy8eu,t3_eliok7,1578491219.0,"A slice of wholemeal toast, spinach (use frozen to keep it in budget) and 1-2 poached eggs. Very filling and nutritious."
DavidBowie,fdh65cg,t3_elbuk3,1578416208.0,"His Labyrinth costume and wig. Or his look from the Time will crawl video, so '80s it hurts."
DavidBowie,fdgz7c6,t1_fdguf33,1578411877.0,"Because I've got eyes. It's really obvious sometimes. Not to mention, his hair was thinning at the beginning of the '80s (when he had a more natural hair style) in a similar pattern of male baldness that his dad had. Men's hair gets thinner as they get older,  not thicker.

Carlos Alomar let the cat out of the bag anyway, on Facebook when he mentioned a hairpiece that Teddy Antolin (his hairdresser) had made. He was probably referring to the the Glass spider mullet. If you look closely, it's obviously just sitting there on the top of his own hair."
DavidBowie,fdg0c1o,t3_el6yp2,1578375454.0,"He had a hairdresser with him on tour and for photoshoots. When he was older he wore wigs and hairpieces a lot of the time.

His hair was straight and thick so it must have quite easy to look after, but even so there are photos where it's a bit messy, like when he was recording YAs. There's a photo where it's all floppy."
DavidBowie,fdeldfr,t3_ek5kkd,1578341480.0,"Songs I can recommend - 

Quicksand, The Bewlay brothers (Hunky dory)

Conversation piece. There are 2 versions, one when he was a young man in 1969, one he rerecorded in 2002 (?), it's a beautiful song that deals with feelings of isolation and isolation.

The whole 3 albums of the so called Berlin trilogy, that's Low, Heroes and Lodger. David said these albums were his essential works, and they seem to deal with his personal 'journey' from what seems to have been a mental breakdown in 1975 to his recovery (David took custody of his son around this time and seemed to realise he had to start acting like a responsible mature adult, though I'm sure he still had his moments)

All the songs on Outside, especially I'm deranged. I love this album, it's got a dark edgy undertone, just what I want from Mr Bowie.

And on a lighter note, I love Lady stardust and Everyone says Hi, both of them written about/to Marc Bolan, David's friend who died in 1977."
DavidBowie,fddlj35,t3_ekomuu,1578316848.0,"Interesting thought. I think Ziggy and glam rock generally, belongs in the 70s. It wasn't just about being a freak/shocking/gender bending or whatever. I think that is really over exaggerated. It was about poor kids being able to pop along to Woolworths, buy some nail varnish and glittery eye shadow, and brighten up their dull lives by being 'glam'. Just escapism, really."
fatlogic,fd1gep2,t1_fd0q64h,1578131040.0,"People with lifelong and deepseated  addictions do usually have underlying 'issues' in my experience, it's much more than just a chemical reaction, or a love of 'partying'. Those people can usually get clean when it suits them, and never look back."
fatlogic,fcyxsxx,t3_ejlysj,1578089441.0,I actually agree with some of these.
DavidBowie,fcymcqt,t1_fcxs0h2,1578082679.0,"He was going to do Unplugged on MTV but they couldn't reach agreement on a setlist. You could try the Bridge school benefit (Reeves Gabrel, Gail Ann Dorsey and David), and quite a few performances with just himself and Mike Garson on piano, and there's quite a few demos of course."
fatlogic,fcxpra2,t1_fcwv1f2,1578068579.0,"It's normal to be weighed at the doctors in the UK as well, though I don't know about every visit (I'm never ill and just have the ocassional checkup). My daughter was being weighed monthly because she's on risperidone, even though she's a tiny little girl. They just want to keep an eye out for sudden weight gain."
DavidBowie,fcxmhin,t1_fcxbbgw,1578066480.0,"Yep, agree with this. If you look at any of the old Top of the pops (British chart programme)  on youtube it's easy to see how much crap there was. Sometimes we'd watch the whole programme without a single good record. And that was it for music  another week, apart from the Old grey whistle test, and maybe something on kiddie's TV after school. No wonder we loved our records and our music magazines so much, they were pretty much all we had."
EatCheapAndHealthy,fcq9vix,t3_ei6nzx,1577881798.0,"Dahl - onions, tomatoes, lentils, spices (you can pre prepare a spice mix or buy one if you want, to save time). Serve with rice or naan bread.

Eggs in spinach and tomatoes - Pasta sauce, spinach, smoked paprika/chilli flakes, when the spinach starts to soften drop in some eggs, put lid on and allow to poach for a few minutes. Serve with crusty bread, potatoes or rice.

A tray of mixed mediteranean vegetables, add a few little potatoes and some well drained chickpeas (from a tin), mixed Italian herbs, roast in olive oil and add some grilled halloumi."

DavidBowie,fcju5yj,t3_eha1yi,1577704882.0,"He was an unofficial member of the Small faces for a while, so anything's possible."
DavidBowie,fcf3gvv,t1_fccuvfr,1577626282.0,"You're right. I always think of it as being on YAs, don't know why. I guess Stay would be his STS standby."
DavidBowie,fc92ymv,t1_fc8fqtr,1577546182.0,"That was because he found it difficult to get it sounding exactly the way he wanted to on stage. I think Fame was his 'go to' song from YAs, that seemed to work really well live."
DavidBowie,fc92u2j,t3_egpezu,1577546125.0,"He did mention this in an interview. He didn't consider singing it challenged him as an artist, so he preferred to sing other songs."

Are you actually a Bowie fan? Surely you've heard of Lyndsey Kemp then, a gay man who said he had a sexual and romantic relationship with David Bowie in 1967. And Calvin Mark Lee, the man who David and Angie were both dating? I could go on...

He really didn't pretend to be gay because it was 'trendy', what rubbish."
DavidBowie,fdqbdq3,t1_fdqaie3,1578661982.0,"'Hair wrong'. You can never say that about Bowie. He had so many different styles and colours, anything is possible. We really need some authenticated photos from 1988 (not Glass spider) to compare."
DavidBowie,fdpzz1g,t1_fdpz014,1578648047.0,"The timing is wrong. If it had been dated 1978 or 1983 I would have said yes, it is him, because there are photos from those periods where he looks very similar.

It is difficult to be sure sometimes with candid or amateur photos of him, when he isn't being 'David Bowie'. He liked to not be recognised when he was on his own time so he looked more ordinary."
DavidBowie,fdpvv0m,t3_emgpsf,1578642633.0,"1977, loved Low and Heroes."
DavidBowie,fdpvqr8,t1_fdpp49n,1578642492.0,"I don't think he was. He said that phase only lasted about a week (from writing Word on a wing). He did wear a cross on a chain, but that was for sentimental reasons as it had belonged to his dad."
OldSchoolCool,fdn3axx,t1_fdn2f3i,1578576031.0,"It's really just a reverse of the usual joke when someone posts a photo of their Mom or Grandma with a male celebrity, plenty of posts about them fucking and the celebrity is their real dad. It works because Bowie was known to be bi."
OldSchoolCool,fdn2dib,t1_fdn1oq2,1578575215.0,Alright then. Why though?
OldSchoolCool,fdn1jfw,t1_fdmzkap,1578574449.0,"I was just going on what Angela said. The police were very strict on crowd control and kept a big space between the fans and the stage. Maybe that was just one gig though.

I'm definitely not disbelieving your friends Dad . There was a rumour that he had a boyfriend in Japan around this time and he wanted to bring him back to the US/Uk but his manager talked him out of it."
OldSchoolCool,fdmzijh,t1_fdmwohr,1578572466.0,Crowd surfing in Japan? Sounds unlikely. Good story though. Bowie always said he had a thing for Asian guys.
DavidBowie,fdmu4ms,t1_fdmlfrc,1578565887.0,"Yeah, he dropped that part when he performed it by himself."
DavidBowie,fdmu2y4,t3_em1e39,1578565825.0,"I think it had two main themes, looking back over the '70s, and his ongoing addiction to cocaine (and possibly other drugs as well)."
DavidBowie,fdmslwo,t3_em37zd,1578563743.0,He said he was bisexual. I see no reason not to believe him.
tifu,fdmpoer,t1_fdmn72m,1578559649.0,She got them herself before she met Bowie.
DavidBowie,fdln3js,t1_fdlj2tz,1578527772.0,"I thought it was more likely to be 1983. I did think of those photos and actually I can see a resemblance there. Other possibility is it's not the guy's dad, he found the photo somewhere and guessed the year wrong. I know he used to visit Greece sometimes so that part matches up. Oh I love these little Bowie mysteries."
DavidBowie,fdkxied,t1_fdkm6ui,1578513195.0,I know. It's almost as funny as the comment thread on the Dancing in the street vid on youtube.
DavidBowie,fdkxd3x,t3_elw2st,1578513107.0,Is it really him? I can't make my mind up.
OldSchoolCool,fdkra0p,t1_fdkjfos,1578509504.0,You're completely wrong there.
OldSchoolCool,fdkpyug,t1_fdkoego,1578508726.0,Were you there?
OldSchoolCool,fdkpt4t,t1_fdkicab,1578508632.0,That's not what he said.
OldSchoolCool,fdkppfr,t1_fdknn07,1578508570.0,"He had plenty of male partners - Lyndsey Kemp, Calvin Mark Lee, Tony Zanetta, and others."
DavidBowie,fdkcwiw,t3_elhsbt,1578501213.0,"Lol, this is funny. Could he be any more camp?"
DavidBowie,fdk7uto,t1_fdk3j8i,1578498074.0,"Luther Vandross is the essential factor, in my opinion."
DavidBowie,fdk7rbn,t3_elsrt5,1578498011.0,"The best version was on the Dick Cavett show. It would have been perfect if not for David overdoing the 'refreshments' beforehand, which really affected his voice. Personally I thought the version at the start of the medley on The Cher show was absolutely fantastic, such a shame they had  to segue into the medley (though bits of that were quite good as well)."
EatCheapAndHealthy,fdjy8eu,t3_eliok7,1578491219.0,"A slice of wholemeal toast, spinach (use frozen to keep it in budget) and 1-2 poached eggs. Very filling and nutritious."
DavidBowie,fdh65cg,t3_elbuk3,1578416208.0,"His Labyrinth costume and wig. Or his look from the Time will crawl video, so '80s it hurts."
DavidBowie,fdgz7c6,t1_fdguf33,1578411877.0,"Because I've got eyes. It's really obvious sometimes. Not to mention, his hair was thinning at the beginning of the '80s (when he had a more natural hair style) in a similar pattern of male baldness that his dad had. Men's hair gets thinner as they get older,  not thicker.

Carlos Alomar let the cat out of the bag anyway, on Facebook when he mentioned a hairpiece that Teddy Antolin (his hairdresser) had made. He was probably referring to the the Glass spider mullet. If you look closely, it's obviously just sitting there on the top of his own hair."
DavidBowie,fdg0c1o,t3_el6yp2,1578375454.0,"He had a hairdresser with him on tour and for photoshoots. When he was older he wore wigs and hairpieces a lot of the time.

His hair was straight and thick so it must have quite easy to look after, but even so there are photos where it's a bit messy, like when he was recording YAs. There's a photo where it's all floppy."
DavidBowie,fdeldfr,t3_ek5kkd,1578341480.0,"Songs I can recommend - 

Quicksand, The Bewlay brothers (Hunky dory)

Conversation piece. There are 2 versions, one when he was a young man in 1969, one he rerecorded in 2002 (?), it's a beautiful song that deals with feelings of isolation and isolation.

The whole 3 albums of the so called Berlin trilogy, that's Low, Heroes and Lodger. David said these albums were his essential works, and they seem to deal with his personal 'journey' from what seems to have been a mental breakdown in 1975 to his recovery (David took custody of his son around this time and seemed to realise he had to start acting like a responsible mature adult, though I'm sure he still had his moments)

All the songs on Outside, especially I'm deranged. I love this album, it's got a dark edgy undertone, just what I want from Mr Bowie.

And on a lighter note, I love Lady stardust and Everyone says Hi, both of them written about/to Marc Bolan, David's friend who died in 1977."
DavidBowie,fddlj35,t3_ekomuu,1578316848.0,"Interesting thought. I think Ziggy and glam rock generally, belongs in the 70s. It wasn't just about being a freak/shocking/gender bending or whatever. I think that is really over exaggerated. It was about poor kids being able to pop along to Woolworths, buy some nail varnish and glittery eye shadow, and brighten up their dull lives by being 'glam'. Just escapism, really."
fatlogic,fd1gep2,t1_fd0q64h,1578131040.0,"People with lifelong and deepseated  addictions do usually have underlying 'issues' in my experience, it's much more than just a chemical reaction, or a love of 'partying'. Those people can usually get clean when it suits them, and never look back."
fatlogic,fcyxsxx,t3_ejlysj,1578089441.0,I actually agree with some of these.
DavidBowie,fcymcqt,t1_fcxs0h2,1578082679.0,"He was going to do Unplugged on MTV but they couldn't reach agreement on a setlist. You could try the Bridge school benefit (Reeves Gabrel, Gail Ann Dorsey and David), and quite a few performances with just himself and Mike Garson on piano, and there's quite a few demos of course."
fatlogic,fcxpra2,t1_fcwv1f2,1578068579.0,"It's normal to be weighed at the doctors in the UK as well, though I don't know about every visit (I'm never ill and just have the ocassional checkup). My daughter was being weighed monthly because she's on risperidone, even though she's a tiny little girl. They just want to keep an eye out for sudden weight gain."
DavidBowie,fcxmhin,t1_fcxbbgw,1578066480.0,"Yep, agree with this. If you look at any of the old Top of the pops (British chart programme)  on youtube it's easy to see how much crap there was. Sometimes we'd watch the whole programme without a single good record. And that was it for music  another week, apart from the Old grey whistle test, and maybe something on kiddie's TV after school. No wonder we loved our records and our music magazines so much, they were pretty much all we had."
EatCheapAndHealthy,fcq9vix,t3_ei6nzx,1577881798.0,"Dahl - onions, tomatoes, lentils, spices (you can pre prepare a spice mix or buy one if you want, to save time). Serve with rice or naan bread.

Eggs in spinach and tomatoes - Pasta sauce, spinach, smoked paprika/chilli flakes, when the spinach starts to soften drop in some eggs, put lid on and allow to poach for a few minutes. Serve with crusty bread, potatoes or rice.

A tray of mixed mediteranean vegetables, add a few little potatoes and some well drained chickpeas (from a tin), mixed Italian herbs, roast in olive oil and add some grilled halloumi."

DavidBowie,fc92ymv,t1_fc8fqtr,1577546182.0,"That was because he found it difficult to get it sounding exactly the way he wanted to on stage. I think Fame was his 'go to' song from YAs, that seemed to work really well live."
