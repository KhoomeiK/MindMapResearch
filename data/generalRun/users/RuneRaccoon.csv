I have my therapist's cell number, and she encourages me to text or call if something is up. She also likes me to update her on my psych appointments, even if I don't have an appointment with her straight away. Not having that support network sucks."

It doesn't always work out, but at least it gives me a couple of days to try to get used to it. If you can afford to, taking some time off might be a good idea. It's better to take some vacation than to screw up too badly at work, I think."

I know in my depressive state I've dragged other people down with me, so make sure you're looking after yourself, too. It isn't easy caring for people, and if you have others in her support network - doctors, therapists, other friends - then you're not shouldering the burden by yourself.

I often have to go take a walk around just to get my head space together. Its nothing to feel guilty about; we're not supposed to waste our lives in a tiny cubicle making money for the higher ups.

The worst for me would be when friends are taking and I ask what they're talking about and I get a ""nothing, don't worry about it"", because *obviously* they're talking about me. I also used to think that people were laughing at me whenever I heard people laughing near me. Paranoia is no fun, and I really know what you're going through. I wish you all the best.
