books,ff2w21x,t3_ercxjc,1579526333.0,Read them many times as a child but as an adult they seem a bit simple. I guess you could say that I graduated to Tolkein from Lewis.

UpliftingNews,fe8ni8h,t3_enx6zs,1578928283.0,"I read an amazing book by a brilliant neuroscientist named V.S. Ramachandran.   The Tell-Tale Brain: A Neuroscientist's Quest for What Makes Us Human, is an amazing look at how flexible the brain can be, especially in  the early stages of development.  His other book, Phantoms in the Brain was also a great read."

AskReddit,fdrr0jx,t1_fdrphu4,1578688338.0,Normally that's definitely on the table but the period was a surprise for me and she's totally forgotten (we were drunk). She was mortified I was laughing.
AskReddit,fdrqt8i,t1_fdrlawn,1578688217.0,I had blood on my cheeks that looked like wings. So the next day at school I kept making red-wing jokes to her mortification lol

cats,fdrjeza,t1_fdrgfjd,1578685324.0,Thanks. You too. Fido had a girl we call Momma and they loved each other so much. They were always together. She still leaves him his spot at their window. Kind of crushing.
cats,fdres0j,t3_emv08q,1578683560.0,"My boy Fido did. We lost him in July 2019 :/

uraniumglass,fdqjy0n,t1_fdqjix8,1578668489.0,Good idea. I have an old dorm refrigerator that doesn't work I was going to run it in.
uraniumglass,fdqfon6,t3_emmpkt,1578665485.0,We've been at it since July and we have a lot more than this (mostly plates and other dishes) but you have way more high quality stuff! Keep on keepin' on!  We've overflowed our hutch so this weekend will be the reorganization and installation of more lighting. I'll post when we're set up!

uraniumglass,fd4qxx6,t1_fd4pnhy,1578170194.0,On a shelf with a chipped pitcher and some plates and a few clear rests. They wanted $185. I talked them down dramatically with a small bundle package deal.

personalfinance,fcuyqkf,t3_ej1doe,1577991188.0,Call them and explain the situation. I've done this before and if you have a good history they'll likely write a letter to get the negative item off your reports. Good luck!

Our 6 cats go crazy for this stuff when we work with them by putting dabs on a pill shooter to acclimate them to the pill shooter.

torties,fcu6c5x,t3_eiqzq3,1577973617.0,And you've been found lacking!
torties,fcngqgj,t1_fcnfq0y,1577811367.0,Sounds like a plan! The two cats in my pic are enemies so we're using the popper as a tool to help them get along too. Spot is learning to chill with Alex but Alex (who lived upstairs for 5 years before we could train her to come to the living room with us.) hates him and hisses and growls. S l o w l y it's getting better! They are VERY trainable.
OldSchoolCool,fcngh7b,t3_ehy9pv,1577811213.0,Before she turned into a horrible ghoul.
torties,fcnc90z,t1_fcnc1oi,1577808580.0,It's never too late to start building up positive experiences! It's takes minutes and you can also use the popper as a target to lure and direct your cats where you want them to go.
