Not in any way relevant to this discussion, which is about Wales. You are focussing on your tiny little corner of the world, ignoring the fact that GSHP's are literally the most efficient form of heating, globally.

That is a net 3kW per kW gain. A system designed to run at a 10kW input will give a 40kW output. Maths.

>""Long term use of geothermal heat pumps in heating mode only, thus removing heat from the ground, can lead to cooling of the soil around the probe. This phenomenon leads to decrease of the heat pump performance.""

This depends on many factors, subsoil type, water table level etc. The brief of the article states that this was measured around the probe of a geothermal pump of an experimental house built in the grounds of Bucharest Polytechnic. The annual precipitation in Bucharest is almost exactly half that of Tonyrefail, so it is fair to assume that the water table and soil temperature conductivity are significantly lower. 

The temperature drop around the probe are to be expected, and although there will be a decrease in efficiency that decrease will be inconsequential and does not alter the fact that GSHPs are the most efficient method of heating houses, worldwide.

2 things. 
Firstly the scheme is based on ground-source heat pumps, not electric heaters. 1kW of electricity in gives approx 4kW of heat out.

worldnews,fdv7ccm,t1_fduyaht,1578744168.0,"Certainly. 
For a start, most people look at this completely backwards.
Modern, intensive agricultural models work almost exclusively on monoculture, that is to say the production of a single crop over a large area.
Without fail this leads to nutrient deficit and the need for the introduction of artificial fertilisers.
Furthermore, the carbon content of the soil is depleted, soils get thinner as the organic content disappears, water retention drops and ultimately soils become incapable of sustaining life. 
Insect biodiversity falls away, this feeds up the food chain and swathes of land become barren.
Permaculture works on the basis of cultivating a whole variety of plants and animals in a closed loop. By demanding less of the soil and nurturing the local environment all of the ills of monoculture are avoided. Soils are enriched, nutrient and organic levels rise, once barren land can be brought back into productivity.
You say ""less productive"", I say sustainable and regenerative.
Not only are soils improved and maintained, but so are insect numbers and diversity (vital for pollination) which leads to natural control of pests. Furthermore, water retention is enhanced, which helps counter droughts and flooding. Stability."
