todayilearned,ff351gv,t3_er6hp8,1579533845.0,"The stigma and shame were real, but there was also a lot of fear going on.  The fear was mostly driven by ignorance, meaning lack of scientific medical knowledge about the mystery disease and distrust of the early groups that contracted it.

For a long while, they had no idea what caused it, even. It hit ""gays, hemophiliacs, interveneous drug users, and Haitians"" and that was all they knew for a long time (a year?, I forget).  

Anyway, if you 1) had it and 2)  acknowledged it and 3) if you were NOT Haitian or a hemophiliac, then having the disease and acknowleding it would have essentially outed you as gay or a drug user, even if those things weren't true.  Therefore hiding the disease happened.  Also, it caused racism against Haitians.

When Princess Diana reached out to sufferers and Elizabeth Taylor supported Rock Hudson, those events were BIG news and we should never forget the true advancement in knowledge these type of public support actions brought about.

Pointedly stated, Ronald Reagan's lack of support, for research and otherwise) exacerbated the delay in real information to stop the spread.

Also, once the the cause was known, I believe that knowledge fueled The Jet Set's sex addicts to go for younger partners, of which many were possibly trafficking victims who were groomed for willingness via promises of ""modeling careers"" and so forth.

Abandonment is the tragedy. Don't do that to your cat.

Also, they can be expensive.  In college, spending hundreds of dollars at the vet, plus the time to nurse that abscessed bite several times a day wasn't cool.  That's when we stopped letting outside.  That, and I didn't want her to get stolen.

Thank you for sharing your experience of fixing things while management is trying to distract the inspector, but that doesn't say much for the places that you've worked. (I'm not asking where.) 

Yes, it may well be that our few sushi places around here are basically clean, but everyone deserves the actual inspection results to make their own decisions. I'll pretty much eat anywhere over 90%, unless the issue details are egregious.

Personally, I don't like when places keep take out containers etc. on the floor. Gross. That can be ""fixed"" as a one-time for the inspector, but does illustrate bad kitchen management practices, if documented, in my opinion.

As a side note, it's gross to see wait staff wearing rings and bracelets that look like hard-to-clean, germ traps and, although I saw this listed in a report, to me that's more of a gratuity issue - like it would be if I see them put their fingers on my glass rim or plate surface.

Also, it seems like various places listed have trouble washing dishes at temperature, not storing utensils in dirty buckets, using dirty rags, and things like that.  Again, easy things that, if they prioritized doing a good job, would never come up in an inspection.

I will still plan to spend most of my restaurant money (too much, honestly) at places with *consistently* high marks. Like I said previously, it's too expensive to toss over money to people that don't care to do a consistently good job.
