AskMen,ffvtv8b,t1_fful181,1580273105.0,"I can see how it's seemingly annoying but sometimes the women have been hurt before through forms that started as simple friendships and those women don't like to be hurt again, as goes the saying fool me once shame on you fool e twice shame on me. It's a method of covering her bases, though technically not right. 

I say that to say I was one of those girls who distrusted one of my bfs girlfriends so much that I did eventually get access to his messages between him and her where she sent him a picture of herself half naked in a very revealing bathing suit in a very revealing pose. I was mad at the boyfriend for not establishing boundaries with this girl(who was an ex who cheated on him anyways) but I was also mad at this girl for disrespecting her current relationship and mine.

In some cases it goes deeper than most guys realize and some girls give their entire soul to some guys only to have it shattered. Most situations they'd just need a talk."

politics,femo6dy,t1_fem5lqa,1579264425.0,"If it's too much then there shouldn't be a problem in reducing the amount we spend on it. We have no reason to constantly play hero when they can do what they want with the oil they bought from us or vice versa. It's not our job. And wasting the money on things that worsen the environment anyways is still idiotic. Also the 30-40 year old rules are meant to be interpreted in a new fashion because that's what Jefferson said they were supposed to be. The laws change as life changes and Jefferson and the rest of the founding fathers intended for us to change them if need be. 

The RBG thing? There shouldn't be a problem when adding another party's justice to the system anyways."

politics,felm90w,t1_felkv53,1579225546.0,"The last part of your argument is highly hypocritical since the Republican party has been known to oppose any and all types of compromise when dems propose them. Even so let's try and get back on course here. We are talking about the military, not businesses(even though I know that's What the Republican party is actually about while democrats are actually just all over the place). What exactly are the American people receiving from the United states going into wars/battles that have nothing to do with them in the middle east? Other than having to pay higher taxes to fund the wars and gas prices rising because we ""found"" more oil or course."
politics,felbnyt,t1_felb7eq,1579218401.0,I'm independent and think both parties are dumb for not compromising so please stop trying to refer to me as one lol. My question was why do you question and have a problem when democrats want you to spend money elsewhere other than through expenses for war and helping other countries rather than creating peace. With the unnecessary amounts we use for war we could be using to reduce homelessness and other problems like affordable health care.
politics,felaqwb,t1_fel9zit,1579217796.0,I'm not saying democrats didn't have problems with it either tbh. I'm saying you guys only bring up questions about money whenever we try to put it towards our actual country rather than just troops.
politics,fel6aj7,t1_fekx6vl,1579214975.0,1st: shooting down the plane was an accident on Iran's behalf. 2nd: no i wasnt talking about ww3. Not surprised you assume thats the case especially when there are plenty of other wars and battles the U.S. decide to fight in that you seem to forget.
politics,fekkezw,t1_fekk2gv,1579201896.0,You guys don't ask that question about the wars though
TwoXChromosomes,fefg47f,t1_fef7jf2,1579055601.0,Totally accept that. She has a history of shaming people(including me) for doing certain things(whether behind their backs or not) and thinking certain ways so I'll hope she isn't bad to me.

So we can pay for war but we can't pay for universal healthcare?

Cringetopia,fe555uw,t3_enmsfc,1578865744.0,Ooo legitimate cringe
unpopularopinion,fe2h5fd,t1_fe0drlm,1578838311.0,"It's not really an attack on the individual's who do it most of the time. It's an attack on how the media does certain cultures dirty. Some people may say ""look what I did! I created something!"" Which justifies people attacking them for cultural appropriation but the media typically does that. Unless those people who are being used by the media to claim ""that's not what this is"" speak up then the problem with remain, since not stopping the problem definitely doesnt help either."
unpopularopinion,fe07fyf,t1_fdxs0uh,1578805063.0,"Those cases of people getting triggered are typically because black people are berated for wearing the same thing. Many black actors do but are immediately labeled as bad but when the white actors do it it's ""amazing"" and ""innovative"". Usually it's not the individual's fault, more so the media, but that doesn't mean individuals don't cause the problem at all."
unpopularopinion,fe076ru,t3_en8rrv,1578804853.0,"I get what you're saying, however most times the ""cultural appropriation"" takes place when the other race is given credit and made to look amazing for copying the actions/looks of another race. Such as with the minorities. For example: Race A is being discriminated against because of their hairstyle and criticized by the media. Race B suddenly decides to copy the hairstyle after a long time of A being discriminated because of it, but Race B gets praise for ""making a statement"". That is where the outrage comes from. Yeah you're from the same country but you're getting credit for what I did while I got in trouble.

It's like when you just got in trouble for doing a dance for your parents but when your sibling comes right after you and does it(not even better) they get props for being innovative. 

There is more to it honestly but that's the main thing."
RBNChildcare,fe01ybd,t3_enex9s,1578801054.0,I'm a very spiritual person(not religious but i feel auras) and I think you are conflicting with her aura. I suggest doing as another comment said and figure out why you disliked hugging your mother so much and take a deep evaluation of when this all started to happen.
AmItheAsshole,fdvtk18,t1_fdvlx7l,1578751297.0,"Not if I trust them. And i dont count since I have trauma from past incidents with friends, family, and loved ones. Even so if I was a guy I wouldn't ask my partner for a paternity test first thing."
unpopularopinion,fdtkdad,t3_emvzt0,1578718014.0,Actually we are depressed af but society doesn't give af so might as well laugh about it with them and make fun of the shit we already knew was bad.
AmItheAsshole,fdsgdp9,t1_fdsdk4e,1578702195.0,"Acknowledging your doubt about someone that you should trust indefinitely means you do not trust them.

Dictionary definition of trust: ""firm belief in the reliability, truth, ability, or strength of someone or something.""

Dictionary definition of doubt: ""a feeling of uncertainty or lack of conviction""

If you are uncertain of something then you do not firmly trust it. Such as this case. If you are uncertain of the genes of the child your partner created, even though they told you that you were the only person they had sex with, you do not *trust* them because to trust someone is to *firmly believe* them. In this case the guy does not *firmly believe* the female when she said it was his so he wants a paternity test. He thinks she is not telling telling the *truth* so he doesn't *trust* her even though they have history. 

You can't argue facts here, such as the dictionary."
AmItheAsshole,fdsc7sg,t1_fdsbwok,1578699276.0,"Ok Idk if I'm speaking gibberish or something and Idk how hard is it to understand the concept that if you dont think the child is yours then, you dont trust your partner. So peace to you. Hope you come to your senses."
AmItheAsshole,fdsbe8z,t1_fdsafln,1578698723.0,"What? If you ask for a paternity test that means you think the child isn't yours, which means you think the child could be someone else's, which means you think your partner cheated because the only way to get pregnant is through sex(in their case at least). No going around this and turning this into instinct. A paternity test is about whether the child is yours or not. Asking for one makes you think it's not yours so he thinks the gf is cheating. NTA."
AmItheAsshole,fdsa7an,t1_fdrgpp7,1578697918.0,So he doesn't trust her. You just pointed it out yourself.

toxicparents,fdb0mav,t3_eked4v,1578252351.0,That sounds terrible. Your decision is not bad and your explosion was totally justified. I don't really have any advice on the situation because I'm new to relationship myself but start strong and remember to not take you're anger out on you're bf or project. I hope you get better!
AskMen,fdargot,t3_ekf1c8,1578249263.0,I wander into my parents room when they arent doing anything or go up to my bf and just lightly poke them(usually in the stomach) or just place my hand on them(like my stepdad's bald head

Cringetopia,fdaf4p4,t1_fd9xxdx,1578245377.0,Yeah hate when some people think furrys(not the weirdo animal fuckers) have sex with animals. No. We just feel sexier as something with more instinct rather than subconscious.
Cringetopia,fdaex4q,t1_fda682t,1578245286.0,Yeah. I'm a light amount of furry(I just like wearing the dollar store tail and ears sometimes. Would i wear it while fucking my bf? Maybe cause it makes me feel a little sexier but i will not use a buttplug) and this shit made me cringe. All was fine until the last bit. I hate that this is what being a furry is projected as.
