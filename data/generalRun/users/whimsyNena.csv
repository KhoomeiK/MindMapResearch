Things like preferring silver to gold feel very odd. Some women feel like queens wearing gold, harnessing the power of the sun.  

Or being introverted over being extroverted. I’ve met women with the witchy power to make friends with a brick wall. (The ability to socialize in a breezy, kind manner and to immediately knock down someone’s defenses.) Stuff like that is energy and magic and spiritual. Human connection. 

So is our connection to plants and animals (don’t get me wrong, I feel at home in a swamp); but I think we’re doing a disservice to our sisters when we start carving out who is or isn’t a witch. 

It’s not up to us to say who does or doesn’t fit in here.

He’s suffering the realization that any fantasy he may have has about his father, including your relationship with him, is wrong. It’s like having a dream shattered. And being a hormonal teenager with an underdeveloped brain and struggling to understand how he “fits” in the world? Well, anger (which is really fear) and mistrust (self-preservation) manifest. 

You have to talk to him again. Let him lash out until he’s all done. He doesn’t have a right to overstep boundaries with his mother by asking about your sex life, but maybe you can calm his fears (that you could be a manipulating, heartless monster) by talking to him about how his father and you met. Not just the backstory or bits and pieces. Everything. 

And then maybe all three of you should talk. 

You’ll all be fine as long as the adults in the room stay calm.

changemyview,fejq1eb,t1_feiumr9,1579182918.0,"So let me explain how politics work here, for the most part. 

Candidate campaigns using money from big business in exchange for legislative favors, but they don’t word it that way because then it would be illegal. 

Candidate makes promises to constituents they fully intend to keep. 

Candidate wins election. 

Candidate is pressured by lobbyists and party leaders to break promises to their constituents. 

Candidate caves when party threatens to unseat them, businesses threaten to pull future campaign funding, chamber leadership refuses to read their bills, etc. They become a “lame duck” because their one vote in a sea of 100+ really doesn’t matter. 

Under pressure from lobbyists with the same threats at above, politicians gut education to funnel money into the industrial military complex. 

Adults enter the work force with more skills but less critical thinking ability and have been indoctrinated to “follow orders” and be a “patriot.” Anyone who deviates from this is usually ostracized by the groups “in power.”

Now, these adults who lack critical thinking skills, compassion, and curiosity, are being told by politicians “that group hates you, they want you to suffer and take away your rights, they hate XYZ (marriage, babies, love, whatever)”. 

The country becomes divided and both groups think they retreat from interacting with the other side. So now they can only form opinions on the other side based on things like corporate media, anecdotes, and social media. All of which are distorted and don’t provide a view of the whole person. 

Now there’s an enemy next door and you have to fight to make sure your children can live the same manipulated existence, exchanging your labor for slowly devalued reimbursement, and if you don’t comply with “The Plan” and you die because you don’t have health insurance, it’s your own fault for being “lazy” or “a criminal” or if you just had the misfortune to be born in circumstances less than ideal. 

And you are constantly berated with phrases like “the left...” and “the right...” We call each other names and tell people they’re going to burn in a hell they don’t believe in. 

And everyone’s emotions are wrapped up in everything they believe, because those are **their** beliefs! It’s all we have that can’t be taken away from us. And God help anyone who tries to disagree or reason against because you can’t have debates in this country unless you’re running for president (even those have devolved), instead you have arguments, verbal fights, without any use of logic. 

So you avoid those, too. You vote for a third party. You are ridiculed for this, maybe even blamed for the state of the country because your vote could have prevented the current incumbent from doing what they’re doing. Your candidates never win. Are you even voting?

Maybe you stick with one of the two main parties, which have a financial grip on the country, because you want to feel like your vote counts.  But regardless of what you do, there is corruption on all sides. 

For people who are aware of the issues, there aren’t enough of us to dismantle the current system. At least, that’s how it appears every election. Local, state, federal. Third party wins are a rarity and anyone D or R is vulnerable to what party leadership wants, which is what their donors want. 

The government is running exactly the way certain people want it to. It isn’t broken, it’s designed. And while the majority of Americans wouldn’t be swayed by money (go to a Trump supporter and offer them $1M to vote for Hillary, or go to a Bernie support and offer them the same to vote for Biden), we don’t have the money to sway things the other way. 

And hey, I could be completely wrong. Maybe money isn’t really that big of a political motivator for politicians. Maybe we can re-elect the entirety of congress and make our country less of a joke to the rest of the world. Maybe we can get some reform relevant to the 21st century like giving children the same human rights as adults, healthcare, change in drug policy and immigration, better protections against human trafficking, working on peaceable relations with other countries, using our military for improvement of infrastructure and wilderness stewardship, and (here’s a controversial one) consolidating all our “Intelligence” agencies and military branches into one, functioning, collaborative unit. I’m anti-military in general but understand the need for a defense branch as long as it doesn’t become the aggressor.

Or maybe things will continue like this until some nutcase decides to push the red button. 

When we’re young, we’re idealistic.  
When we enter the work force, we’re hopeful. 
By the time we’ve put a decade or so in, we realize the beast is too big to slay and constantly focusing on it will drive up depression and stress (which we can afford, even with health insurance.)
Once we’re old we say things like “that’s just how things are” and “get over it” because we spent a lifetime hoping our votes would make things better. 

There were 25 candidates,  now 12, from a single party for the office of the president. 

We don’t have the time or resources to vet 25 people and their actions over the past 70 years. That doesn’t even include the incumbent (who has so much coverage it would take a lifetime to critically investigate all the claims made) or third parties (of which there are many). So how do we make a responsible choice?"

The **best thing** you can do for your clothes is to follow the washing instructions. Don’t put bras in the dryer or if a shirt says “wash inside out,” do it. Don’t put wool in the dryer. Zip up the zippers and button the buttons. Make sure your socks aren’t scrunched up. Separate whites out so they don’t look dingy. Don’t wash your delicates with towels.

On a serious note, I’m amazed the school felt the need to take it this far. At this point, the church is cutting off it’s nose to spite it’s face. Rainbows are unChristian? Maybe someone should inform Noah?

This level of discrimination - guilty by accidental association - worries me. The school is teaching students to ostracize people who wear or like rainbows! It’s so far from a message of keeping children safe and healthy.

What size is the audience? How many people are impacted by the statement and to what degree? Kresley Cole saying something is different from Nora Roberts because a Roberts has a bigger reach and more influence. But if Cole would say something to intentionally cause another person harm, that’s an issue too.

books,fe9l6rc,t1_fe71qz6,1578938989.0,"I specifically mention banning books in another one of my comments here. I’m against banning books, even awful ones, as they all have value (even if it’s just “don’t do these awful things.”) 

I disagree wholly that publishers are obligated to publish anyone. How would a publisher even know the race of an author? Most work with agents who serve as proxies for manuscript submission. I suppose name or subject matter. 

Publishers have every right to choose how they spend their money. Are you suggesting publishers should have affirmative action?

I get the basics of systematic racism in America, I’ve been directly impacted by it my whole life. But I want my book published because it’s good and it will sell, not because my parents passed on genetics that make me look different from Sally Jane.

books,fe94qul,t1_fe92jr9,1578934248.0,"I think we can only take words at face value if there is no other context. If an author points out that another author has made some less than savory comments in the past and that’s it? They’re just informing people of what’s been written before an each individual is responsible for their own actions. 

If an author is actively saying “don’t buy from Jane Doe because she writes racist stuff” my opinion on the matter would depend on the size of the audience and whether or not the statements are true and in what context. 

There’s a lot of nuance here. On the one hand, no one is forcing anyone to make a decision and people are responsible for their own actions. On the other hand, do public figures have the moral obligation to temper their words based on their possible impact? If they know their statements will incite their followers, to what degree is that acceptable? Dislike, boycotting, protesting, riots?

Because that’s not censorship. No one is banning her books or stopping her from fundraising from her fans or use her own money to self-publish. 

You do not have a “right” to exposure."
