news,ffcjcg1,t3_esuqkc,1579800694.0,"For those who need ELI5 and for those who are dismissing the metaphor as pointless:

This is absolutely meaningful. The ""metaphor"" is actually a measure of the state of humanity in crisis. The more we are fucking shit up the closer we are to a ""doomsday"" event. This doesn't mean that we are going to reach a doomsday event at any particular time, but it does mean that if we maintain the present course that horrible things are to come for humanity. With climate change getting worse, terrorism on the rise, political tensions, the threat of nuclear war, and potential viral epidemics the probability of some existential threat to humanity is high and getting higher. That is the significance of moving the hands forward twenty seconds. 

And this time it's even more significant because this is the first time the hands have been within the two minute mark. Even closer than during the cold war! That is a potent statement. It means that we are within the ""two minute warning"" and it's time to take action. 

Don't dismiss this."

Tunneling does not imply that any amount of energy, let alone infinite, can be spontaneously created.
