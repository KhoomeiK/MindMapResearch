It doesnt have to be jesus or god either. Its just whether you can let the universe give you the knowledge of depression and make it past it. I realize its a medical condition too and it doesnt make any sense, but trust. Sorry, I'm not trying to preach, honestly ""god"" is what is helping me the most these days. Just listen."

I came to the realization that holidays are ALWAYS really stress filled and super daunting for people, depressed or not. But I think a large measure of holiday stress we all completely bring upon ourselves. I get where you are coming from, hang in there friend."
