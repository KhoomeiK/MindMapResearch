EarthPorn,ff55q99,t1_ff4b1m0,1579580986.0,The interior decorator in me sees a beautiful paint palette here; my old house would have looked so amazing with these colours! I'm in awe at the beauty in the colours of this picture.

iamatotalpieceofshit,feiaf1n,t1_fehu9b0,1579133901.0,"""Alleged"" abuse. *""Alleged""?!* This one incident is clearly on camera; I'm sick thinking of what else that monster has done in the past to that poor girl and the  dogs. This made me physically ill.. I just want someone to hurt that man so bad. Fuck him, and fuck his stupid buddy in blue for bailing him out, instead of leaving him in jail."

interestingasfuck,feasu9t,t1_fe8mebw,1578951901.0,"Does it feel itchy? If you scratch your head, will you detach the glue from your scalp? If it gets caught on something, will it rip from your scalp? Or is the glue so strong that the wig stays in place? Does to hurt to have the hair piece removed? Please tell me how the hairdresser removes the wig for cleaning?( what products are use, etc), because we see how the pieces are applied, but I haven't found anyone sharing links showing the removal process.."

interestingasfuck,fe9z47v,t1_fe9jdk8,1578942714.0,"That sounds like it'd feel really itchy, keeping something glued to one's head for a long time, plus not being able to wash their scalp properly the whole time! But I guess that if the client has enough money they can get their wig and scalp washed every few days(?) I wonder how frequently they have to go to the hairdresser for upkeep?"
interestingasfuck,fe9t12n,t1_fe7rkv4,1578941233.0,"You have a really good perspective on this issue, and I just want to say that I've enjoyed reading your comments today. I am also a woman who *had* a preference for guys with long hair, but in the long run, I honestly won't let such a minor thing deter me from dating someone who was bald/balding if they were kind, honest and compatible with who I am. Conversely, I've only ever dated women with long hair, and I used to ""prefer"" short-haired women; go figure..
Now I've recently started dating a guy who is balding, so he shaves the rest of his head completely bald; we knew each other for about a year before we shot our shots with each other, and I'm really falling for him.. he's also a bit shorter than me, which I couldn't care less about, because he's so sexy to me because of certain things he says and does. 

I'm with you, u/torndownunit; I think it's much easier to be one's self than to introduce oneself as someone they're not, only to surprise people with the ""real you"" later on. And I apply that same reasoning when I present myself as a woman; that's just me, and I'm not judging or condemning women who like more makeup than I do, or high heels, etc. To each their own, right:)"
