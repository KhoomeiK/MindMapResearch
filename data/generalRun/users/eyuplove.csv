You can absolutely get an old car that is better than a brand new car and drive it into the ground.

I've got a BMW 5 series that I've had for 4 years now. It has heated leather, bluetooth, DAB, cruis control, climate control, 60 mpg+ on long runs and it cost me £5k and I've spent about £400 on servicing it over that time and £150 to fix an exhaust issue.

That's it. Oh and it's still worth £4k.

Well let's see (if it ever happens). Wilder doesn't land all that many is my view and by the time Wilder has lined him up AJ could, could, have knocked him out.

If I was coaching someone to fight wilder I'd tell them to smother him because he's not that good on the jnside but then again I don't know shit"

AJ has also KO'd ever fighter apart from Ruiz and Parker so it's not much of a jump. 

Fury has KOs over Whyte, Klitschko, Breazeale (he's shit), Povetkin etc.

He has a pretty good chance of KOing Wilder. Wilder isn't superman ffs. He's knocked out one 45 year old who can actually box, the rest are bums. 
I'm not saying he doesn't have awesome power but he still needs to land it. AJ only needs to land one as well and he's the better boxer"
