There's only a problem when there is a break in skin. At this point, the defense is compromised. Think of the skin as a wall. If you were to demolish part of the wall, things can now get inside. Yes, normal flora live on our skin. We usually do not have issues unless you have been exposed to something that overgrows or is pathogenic."
AmItheAsshole,fgli3id,t1_fgku75g,1580898900.0,"Does she have a locker to store some extra pads? Carry them in a cute pouch in the backpack? Maybe there's a teacher she can confide in who can store some pads for her in her desk? I see that someone commented they will confiscate a pouch, so what about pads kept in a folder? 

Also, those hand warmers were a huge life saver for me for cramps. Midol doesn't do much, but I heard advil/motrin/aleve are better."
Influenster,fgku87u,t3_eyxj76,1580873717.0,Got this as well. Praying I get something. Good luck!

worldnews,fg3444k,t1_fg1quna,1580469457.0,"Aw man, I'm so sorry. We had just gotten over this bad respiratory thing that took out half of my shift toward the end of the year. Fluids, lots of rest, disinfect EVERYTHING, and wash your hands a lot. Cough/sneeze into your sleeve. Try to wear a mask when out in public. 

The shitty thing about the flu is that even when patients come in with it, I'm pretty sure they just get discharged with maybe some meds to help with symptoms. If they're dehydrated, they will get an IV drip. If it's really bad, they might be admitted but that's rare. 

I hope you and your family recover soon and stay healthy!"
worldnews,fg1i2of,t1_fg0xmm4,1580427495.0,"I work in a lab at a hospital and our ED has been packed. I've never seen it like this before. Usually when I leave at midnight, there's a few people. The past week has been consistently full. I feel like people are even more likely to come to the hospital because they are worried it is the coronavirus. We've also been getting A LOT of positive flu a/b or rsv."
instant_regret,ffz3h31,t1_ffz13z9,1580362714.0,Np! Get the therapy flat ones. Then you can tie it to a bed post or something similar and do exercises off of that. I'll try to find videos for you. I'll DM you
instant_regret,ffz01mp,t1_ffwzzuv,1580359695.0,"Recovering from an ankle injury means needing to work on both strength and mobility. If you can get your hands on resistance bands, you can do certain exercises for strength. Since you have issues with mobility, I suggest doing ""abc's"" (tracing the letters with your foot) whenever you have free time. I also recommend those rubber balancing mats to help with propioception. Doing both helpes me regain mobility. Good luck!"

ChoosingBeggars,ffw0qjf,t1_ffviu6t,1580279559.0,YES this was what my parents did for the amusement parks. Apparently carrying the child makes them appear younger....
ChoosingBeggars,ffuj8br,t1_ffug61o,1580243107.0,My family used to do this for amusement parks. I'd be super nervous about getting caught beforehand. It was a lot of stress for 5 year old me pretending to be 3. Now I realize that teens getting paid minimum wage don't care if you're lying.
