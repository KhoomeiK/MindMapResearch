memes,fdu5eut,t1_fdtjl3d,1578727865.0,"And what exactly would this fix? Bullying still happened without phones, and so did distractions- phones are just the medium through which these occur now. Keep kids from having them, which should be the parent's choice, not the government's, and you're just inconveniencing everyone in exchange for shifting everything backwards tech-wise within their age group. 

Phones are a necessity within schools, and everyone is expected to be able to research things on their own. Essay on a book? Online libraries are far better than physical ones. They might not have the book in stock, or at all. Accidentally damage it and you have to pay for it. It's just stupid to take away access to that. 

School tablets? As fucking if. I've switched from school to school and only used one tablet, and it had the computing power of a fucking toaster. No internet access, half of your interactions wouldn't register, etc. Even if they *did* have them, schools have a tendency to block sites. At my school, if you need to know something, you better pray it's on Youtube, because everything else is inaccessible though their internet and computers, which, by the way, are from two decades ago.

And don't try saying, ""Oh, they can just do all this shit at home! On computers that don't have literally every site blocked and don't run like carrots!"" That still solves jack shit! You're cutting down on their time, but the effects are the same. It's just an inconvenience, and needing a ""phone license"" is a fucking stupid idea. You aren't preventing anything, just keeping the younger, legal to oppress from using the technology they've gotten used to and everyone, and I mean everyone, depends on."
