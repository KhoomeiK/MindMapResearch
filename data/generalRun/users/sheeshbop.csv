I think it’s funny when people say we have to respect other people’s religious beliefs. Like no I don’t, they are adults who can’t let go of an imaginary friend.  Their beliefs translate to votes that hurt real people I love, I don’t have to respect that.

Emotional abuse is real and I know women who do it all rather than deal with walking on eggshells around their partner.

I just didn't want you to give up too soon if the pills don't make you feel better immediately. I think the fact you're seeking help means you're already doing better, at least that's how it was for me. Hugs."

I don't care that much though and I've never even asked a dude how tall he was. If he made a big deal about it and ""swore he was 6 feet"" and showed me ID's showing as much (like the comment I was replying to said) I would absolutely be turned off by someone putting so much effort into a lie. 
So yes a 5' 10.5"" tall man with insecurities so rampant he's gonna lie about 1.5 inches.... bye"
