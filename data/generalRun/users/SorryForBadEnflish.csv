fatlogic,fek7uu8,t3_epkiz9,1579194433.0,"Recently. I’ve been really enjoying one-pot chicken and veggie meals with rice or noodles. 

Just season the chicken the day before with whatever spice blend you like, slice it, fry until golden brown all over, add aromatics (onions, garlic, ginger, spices, etc.), fry some more, toss in a mix of veggies and your carb of choice, add chicken stock, and simmer until cooked. You need enough stock to cook your carb, maybe less if your veggies are juicy. 

For my carb, I usually go with rice, small pasta, or noodles. I like to also add some dark soy sauce, sambal, and mushroom oyster sauce, especially when I’m making noodles or pasta. It makes it more saucy. For rice, I usually add some turmeric or saffron. 

For my veggie mix, I like red, orange, and green peppers, broccoli, Asian greens, baby corn, water chestnuts, zucchini, mushrooms (oyster, shiitake, black mushrooms), and pretty much whatever I have on hand.
