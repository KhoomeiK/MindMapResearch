Dallas may be economically important, but that doesn't make it an interesting city to visit. It's not a bad place to live and work, but as far as tourism goes, it's pretty bland.

We both wanted to drink, so driving ourselves was out too. Obviously, no subway/tram system either. So we called a taxi service and asked what the wait time was, and they told us that it would take them TWO HOURS to get a car to my apartment. We ended up just walking to the Mexican place down the street and had margaritas.

Just about everybody has an accent, which is totally fine, but your pronunciation needs to be understandable, and that's what my Japanese student struggled with the most. I've more or less lost my slight southern accent because non-native English speakers have a harder time understanding me, so I try to speak in the standard American accent (like how newscasters speak). 

However in my experience, most people don't pick up on slight regional accents/dialects at all. People still ask me if I'm English all the time, and on occasion when I'm watching a show in English a friend will ask me if the person is from the UK or American.

It was kept in a special cabinet. If you touched any other equipment after even brushing the contaminated stuff with your gloves, it too was put in the contaminated cabinet or thrown away in a special barrel. Coming into contact with it had no real short-term effects, at least that's what I was told, but give it a few years/decades and you could have some serious problems. Or not. If you're lucky. I was always a little paranoid when working with it."
PublicFreakout,fcajaen,t1_fc61egs,1577570258.0,"I used to run the self checkout registers. Those things break down all the time and no one in the store is allowed to fix them. A coworker of mine complained to me once about how often 3 of the four registers would be free, one broken and labeled out of order, and more often than not people would still choose to try to use the broken one first. I'd noticed a similar pattern, but wasn't sure if it was true, or maybe we just were biased and remembering only the inattentive customers. 

So we decided to experiment in the evening when business was slower and boring. We would shut down one register and mark it as out of order. And by mark it, I mean we taped a sign on the edge the screen that covered the scanner, taped paper over the cash accepting slots, and put a smaller out of order sign onto the card reader (which is also what we did when they were really broken). Then we tallied it up over a few days and sure enough the ""broken"" register had more customers try to use it first rather than the 3 other functioning ones. I will never understand why."
