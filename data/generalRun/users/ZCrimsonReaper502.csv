My mom used to cry a lot talking about how she should've done this or should've done that and would apologise constantly. So one day (I was about 8 or 9) I told her this, ""if you should've done something and didn't then it wasn't worth it. But if you wanted to do something then let's do it together"". Ever since then she would stop saying stuff like that. Now I'm fresh out of the navy and made her cry more to find out the hard way that I was home. Meaning when she walked out of a residents room to see me in my uniform after two yrs. She cried calling me 'you little shit head'"
