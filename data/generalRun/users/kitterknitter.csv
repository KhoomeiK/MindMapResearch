velvethippos,ffdtgtq,t1_ffdsnhp,1579828511.0,"Oh boy, do I have a story (albeit a very spooky woo-woo one) for you!

After Boo passed, I started experiencing weird shit in the house I was living in - I had objects fall off of shelves without wind or our other cat pushing it (I know because I was looking at him when it happened - it scared the crap out of him). There's probably a perfectly logical explanation for it, but it stopped when I moved house a couple of weeks later. Incidentally, this was about the time that Button, our new kitten, would have been conceived. So when he's being especially Boo-like, it isn't uncommon to have one of us joke that Boo must have jumped straight into Button's mum, knowing that we'd end up adopting one of her kittens. 

It's so funny, he does the exact same flop-and-roll onto the floor, exposing his belly for pets, that she did. And he and our other cat bonded almost immediately, which is fairly uncommon for cats - it's recommended to introduce them quite slowly, as they're pretty territorial creatures, but they were bitching at the door to meet each other very soon after bringing Button home. They also have the exact same meow and shitty attitude lmao. 

I know it's not how things work in real life, but it does make me happy that I get to be reminded of my beautiful girl so often by the weird things that he does.

I used to get in kind of a similar mindset when my PTSD/depression got bad - everything sucks, all jobs are shit, I'll never find anyone to love me, etc (which I've been told is an example of ""black and white thinking""). None of those thoughts turned out to be true. I have healthy relationship with a wonderful partner. I'm almost finished with a degree that will help me get an enjoyable job. I have friends who love me and who I love, which is a miracle considering how awkward I was during high school. 

Depression really isn't showing you anything that you wouldn't have figured out without it. It 100% is just a shitty illness that affects the most essential part of your body. I'd really encourage you to seek counselling if you can (free at Headspace if you're in Aus and under 25) - having someone else peer into your brain and tell you that you have some misconceptions about your own self worth can be pretty helpful. 

Some of us, through genetics or circumstances, have a hard time making the right amount of the right substances in our brains. It's nothing to be ashamed of. 

I find that having a really solid routine helps me manage my mental illness, especially the parts that require consistent effort such as my degree. Is this something that you could incorporate? Making sure that you get enough sleep, getting in half an hour of physical activity and eating enough vegetables and protein sounds stupidly basic but I've found it really helps me manage the black and white thinking patterns I get into. 

I saw in a comment below that you don't want medication, but don't knock it til you try it - it have given me such relief from my mental illness and I manage a lot better now. It's not for everyone but I've seen it help a lot of people and it may be worth a try. But ultimately it's your choice. I just want you to know that there's nothing weak or unmanly about getting the help you need - in fact, taking responsibility for your health is one of the main factors of being someone who has their shit properly together."

fatlogic,ff18e2b,t1_fewoc5z,1579476254.0,"I had that with yoga for a while - I was going through a shit time with my family and every time I'd do yoga, which was the only exercise I did at the time, I'd end up crying. However, I've never felt quite as empty yet serene as when I finished my weird crying yoga sessions. 

I think that exercise can be a very raw thing. Your heart is pumping harder, blood is rushing through your body and you're suddenly very aware that you're alive in a different way than you are when you're sitting down working or watching TV. At least in my experience, it's very difficult to feel numb or ignore the way you feel while you're challenging yourself physically. And when you're alone with no distraction from that, it can get pretty gnarly. 

I think it can be a positive thing, in a way. I have an issue with binge-eating, and usually a binge happens when I'm trying to ignore the bad feelings (I have PTSD). Doing an activity that forces me to deal with the emotions rather than sitting on them has helped me develop some good coping strategies. Stops my usual strategy of ""it puts the emotions in the box and it SHOVES THE BOX INTO A DARK CORNER OF ITS MIND FOREVER.... or it gets the hose again.""

They'd be fine to sleep beside each other in the day and have their meals together but during the typical cat zoom hours, Norb is a freaking monster (we got him a kitten a couple months ago and they get along great because similar energy levels - so much fly tackling occurs in this house between them). But if your two rarely fight, that's probably not the issue. 

Also big mood to hiding under the bed when there are visitors. Norb will bolt for the bed whenever he hears a car pull up, even if it's someone he knows and likes. Cats are mental."
Pets,fd3vyg3,t3_ejznaq,1578162123.0,"I recently found out that when I turn the washing machine on, it rumbles/vibrates one of our litter boxes that is next to it (which explains why it is pooped in less often). Is there anything near the litter boxes that could be going off/making a noise and frightening her while she's trying to pee? 

Feeling your pain with the pee struggles - we had a rescue on trial that hated our original cat and would pee outside the box from stress. She ended up going back into foster for a while but has recently found an awesome home. We used Nature's Miracle because I like the smell but I have a friend who just pours white vinegar into a hot wash full of the peed on items (her cat is elderly and gets confused) and that works pretty good too."
Pets,fd3n4cv,t3_ejz0ti,1578159871.0,"My fatass tabby will usually try to nick some of whatever I'm eating if I'm on the couch, including baby spinach leaves, which he's obsessed with. I don't let him take food off me because a) it's rude and b) I don't want to risk him eating something he shouldn't, but he's three now and I still haven't managed to train him out of it."

Miscarriage,fcuibzh,t3_eit2ml,1577981645.0,"I'm so sorry <3 you're doing exactly the right thing to let yourself grieve. The overwhelming sadness sucks, but it's like pus in a wound - it serves a purpose in your healing, but you've gotta let it out. If you try and hold it in, it'll fester and rot your insides. It's okay to be sad. Let yourself feel your feelings, even if they suck. 

I also felt out of body/like it wasn't real when I had my miscarriage. I think that's probably our brains trying to cope with a terrible situation. 

Sending love to you and yours from me and mine tonight <3"
news,fcuh1fo,t1_fcu9i9p,1577980769.0,"I don't understand the ""no one's expecting me to pick up a hose"", tbh. He's a leader. Somehow a majority of people voted for the daft bastard to be in his position. The least he could have done is pretend that he gives a fuck in the first place, rather than brushing all warnings off and acting surprised when it blew up in his face.  


Edit because I accidently posted early: He could have done so many other things than ""pick up a hose"". He could have done so much good in his position, but has instead decided to prioritise being a selfish cunt. Good on him. Wanker."

I think non-Australians have this impression that we use ""cunt"" all the time, but it's like Americans say ""fuck"" - you wouldn't say it to your nan (unless she was a very cool nan), you wouldn't say it in a job interview or on the news (again, unless you're a wanker like ScoMo)."
