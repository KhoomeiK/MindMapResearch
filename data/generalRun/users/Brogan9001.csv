dndnext,fer8shg,t1_feqwc4b,1579351250.0,"I was thinking of doing something similar.

They find the rebels, but they’re all already dead. Then they hear screaming from other parts of the forest. And this is what brings the players together as a party. A few players could be Jäger corps, others could be line infantry or grenadiers. So their units shattered by whatever is hunting them, the players all individually find a clearing. And so the campaign begins.

UnearthedArcana,fenkpu4,t1_ew7w6co,1579286763.0,"I’m a bit late to the party but just saw this thread and wanted to give my two cents. The way I am planning to do things is to organize gun damage and balance by cartridge and by the individual gun. So you could have a [40 shot chain pistol](https://youtu.be/SgghWnZgJd0) with a pathetic cartridge (1d4), or you could have an [absolute unit of a revolver](https://youtu.be/UhYlzTABNI0) with 6 accurate 1d10 shots but requires 1 or 2 attack actions to reload because it’s percussion cap. Then later in the campaign give access to pin fire cartridges. Maybe you can get your Colt Dragoon modified for metal rimfire cartridges, eliminating or reducing the long reload of the revolver.

So an average .36 pistol will be 1d6 damage, but a .44 will probably be 1d8, unless it has an obscene powder charge like the Walker, and thus 1d10. You could have a .36 with a larger powder charge, thus 1d8. Or one with a lower powder charge, thus 1d4. Then apply the same treatment to shotguns, rifles, etc."
