unitedkingdom,ff9bss5,t1_ff8q5c1,1579709376.0,"You're right, you're not being hyperbolic.

A 1:4 income-to-property value ratio, which has long been held as a good ratio for house prices, leads you to requiring a salary of ~£175k for the current average London house price of ~£700k.

£175k is the salary of non-London city council CEOs, higher than the PM and in the range of the highest band of civil servants (£160-206k).

It's very much a top 1% income.

Remember, there is more variation within the top 1% (£160k-infinite) than within the 99% (£0k-£160k).

Obviously, the government subsidise the lending industry so people can still be owner-occupiers with 1:15 ratios and only a 10% deposit, but it's not a great solution.

My assumption is a lot of people saying this is hyperbole are not aware of how little most people earn, and think they're ""just comfortable"" on £80k DINKY salaries."
unitedkingdom,ff9aakv,t1_ff8vuv5,1579708423.0,"The OP made two separate statements, neither of which were incorrect not particularly hyperbolic.

1.) To become an owner-occupier, you need a very high salary. 2.) Also, rents are high for the space you get.

In the past, you'd be approved for a mortgage if you had a household income of 1/4 of the value of the property you were looking to buy, and often only one person would be working.

Assuming your property is worth, say, 700k, which isn't unreasonable for zone 2; if you were alone, you'd need a salary of £175k per annum for that to be true.

That's the salary of a CEO of a non-London city council.  It's higher paid than the PM, and almost the top of any civil service branch head (highest is £206k).

Definitely a CEO's salary. Remember, there is way more variation in income between the 1% than the 99%; not all CEO'S are paid in the millions.

Now, you can get mortgages approved for a lower ratio than that that and with only say a 10% deposit, but only because the government heavily subsidies the lenders.

Renting is also expensive.  

Your rent for a two bed flat is 3x that of my Edwardian three bed semi up north and I'd assume my house is bigger than your flat, plus it has a little garden.

Humans on the tube, to this system, are not people with internal lives, hopes, dreams, families they care for; but a resource being delivered every morning to be exploited in the pursuit of profit, often at the expense of environmental sustainability.

Now, a lot of people were complaining that they were going o be late, or going to be fired. I'm yet to hear any stories of people actually losing jobs over the extinction rebellion protests, even the ones on the tube. My assumption is that it never happened, because otherwise the Mail would jump on it.

And, you've got to think, why do we as a society settle for jobs where we *could* be fired for being late in the face of international protests? That's partially why system disruption is good. It's about the climate, yes, but it also has to be about economic justice; because economic injustice is what has largely fuelled climate change: the wealthy, both globally and within states, have taken far more resources than they should.

You're right, though, it is sabotage, to some small extent. Protest has to be subversive and probably contain elements of sabotage to be effective.

Have the Tories, seeing the giant support for the school and Earthstrike started actually counteracting climate change? No, they've again given the green light for more fracking, after briefly pausing because of potential property damage.

Did Labour stop support for the Iraq war after almost 5% of the country turned out onto the streets of London in early 2003 to peacefully protest it? No, and it's now killed over a million people and gave rise to Daesh.

Power can easily sweep aside even colossal mass movements that don't put sand in the gears.

Think of things governments now celebrate and act like they always had. Gay Pride wasn't even given the time of day until after the Stonewall riots, and now cities across the democratic world act like it's always been something they support. 

Various world governments celebrate black history month now, and act like they always have. Liberals will tell you Martin Luther King Jr was the cause, but he was only an effective carrot because of the big stick provided by the Black Panther Party being intentionally violent.

Climate change movement has somewhat shifted the Overton window; but currently, those are just words. Until mass movements actually support the dismantling of the fossil fuel industry, by force if necessary, world governments will mostly make overtures while doing the bare minimum and asking that individuals, say, recycle plastic bottles to solve the global, systemic problem.

That they aren't, biologically, different from black people and there must be cultural reasons why, say, crime is higher in black plurality areas of cities. You can't just say ""because blacks are animals"", if white people can freely interbreed with black people. That opens up questions about if historical (or even modern) racism and oppression might have long-lasting impact, and even opens up the door for talks about the perceived superiority of Anglo-Saxon or Germanic origins, and of reparations.

Secondly, miscegenation is never viewed as a force to 'uplift' what they perceive as lesser races to the superiority of white people. It is always viewed as a malicious attempt by black people (or more likely, Jews) to corrupt the white race and bring it down to what they perceive as the lower level of black people.

(Also, feel free to replace black with Pakistani, or Syrian or whatever other non 'white' ethnicity you fancy)."

The Empire enslaved and exported millions, conquered dozens of countries and killed tens of millions of people, we mostly justified and accepted it through racist rhetoric.

Us living today are mostly not responsible for causing that damage, and a lot of us aren't racist; but we do all benefit at least a bit from the racist subjugation of much of Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Carribbean for several centuries.

Good things have come out of Britain and will continue to do so, but there's very much an opportunity cost of the good things that never came out of places we forced to change to fit our imperial needs, or from the people we killed or enslaved.

This is why global apologies, reparations and changing ways should actually be a thing the west (and specifically, ""old Europe"") need to consider."
