Moral injury is a big deal. It cuts us to the core in ways not readily seen or understood. But, it is something we can treat and heal from. 

Seems like you had a big plate of it. Good news is you cleaned up, are reaching out, have some sort of support network in your life that you can count on and a plan of action to address your needs. 

These are Good Things.

pics,ff565fe,t3_ereso6,1579581329.0,"Someone asked about the odd bayonet position and it got me thinking; Could have just been how it settled in post mortem. 

For example, he was cleaning the rifle or something of that nature and was clutching the bayonet and rifle with one hand. 

What is odd to me is his overall position: on his back, arms seemingly relaxed and places to the side. Rifle also set to the side as if laid there. And it is a shallow grave. 

If he had died catastrophically then we could assume that there would be more mangled bits. Helmet would be askew, obvious fractures (though one foot is missing). 

It looks like he was placed in a shallow grave; if he had lain exposed we would see more animal marks. It is odd that he would be buried with his rifle and ammo. One assumes those would be shared with his comrades."

Firearms,ff3zo1i,t1_ff3y621,1579552358.0,"But you are right, there seems to have a bit of a lull. 

There have been some really out there design advances (caseless ammo, multi shot barrels, reciprocating recoil dampeners) but nothing has really made it into the mainstream in terms of issues rifle or in the market. 

At least not that I can think of. 

A lot of the past few decades has been spent on refining cartridge designs and ergonomic particulars. Oh, and optics."
Firearms,ff3z6ly,t1_ff3y621,1579552057.0,"The primary advantages are that a bullpup is shorter overall for the same barrel length. 

So, you get a more compact package without sacrificing velocity. 

Additionally, a bullpup puts the center of gravity behind the firing hand. This translates into reduced fatigue when carrying the rifle up and at the ready. 

Basically, the idea is to utilize the dead space which is the buttstock. 

The disadvantages, near as I can tell, have been poor trigger feel, the action is right under the cheek and so is not even remote ambidextrous, and some executions have been crap (looking at you L-85). 

The Tavor has, from what I am told, a decent trigger out of the box and is rock solid reliable. Others have neat ambidextrous features that, while perhaps not quick to use, at least present the shooter with options."
Firearms,ff3x4hy,t1_ff3wlkk,1579550769.0,"They are neat machines, that is for sure. Definitely a product of the era and evolution of the traditional long gun. 

I wonder when real departures from the same basic format will become the norm. The AUG, FAMAS, Tavor (and others too) have helped to advance the form but are still pretty uncommon. 

Granted, it is a fairly straight forward mechanical task: get this little piece of metal out the end, down range, accurately. If we can self load it, awesome! No, where do we put the action?Magazine? What kind of magazine? What other kind of whiz bang features can we add in that aid the fundamental challenge?
