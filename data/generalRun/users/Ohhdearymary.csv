foxes,fds6ghe,t3_emuh3h,1578695425.0,I love your pink shed and the small purple fencing! It looks wonderful and magical and oh so lovely :)
AskReddit,fdo9emi,t1_fdo201c,1578601168.0,You are welcome! It took me a while to remember the name too.  I wish it was still running :)
AskReddit,fdo8yzj,t1_fdnyiry,1578600950.0,It really was.  I spent so many hours in a day playing on Millsberry.  I wish it was still around :)
AskReddit,fdo8sd1,t1_fdo609h,1578600862.0,"Hello! Ooh that's so interesting!  I've never played neopets,  I might just go on to give it a try"
AskReddit,fdo8m6e,t1_fdo42vh,1578600777.0,I loved it so much too!  Especially the baseball game!
AskReddit,fdn7rk8,t3_em7trd,1578579590.0,"Millsberry.com, I looked it up just now only to find out that it was technically an advert the whole time!"
neurofibromatosis,fdmgdc2,t3_em58lf,1578548985.0,"Yes,  I understand!  I feel that way too,  when you find out 'out of the blue'. It always takes me by suprise!  Thank you for sharing that story :)"
todayilearned,fcn1pzg,t1_fcn1dx6,1577800759.0,"Oh oh okay,  thank you for clarifying. That's very interesting!  I'm curious, what's the largest tip that you have recieved,  if you don't mind me asking?"
todayilearned,fcn03su,t1_fcmxxg3,1577799295.0,"This is so interesting,  thank you for sharing that.  As a part- time job, for a bit of extra money,  it definitely sounds good!  Just to be clear (sorry!),  the customer pays the tour company a standard price and you get to keep all the tips after paying the fees?"
CrappyDesign,fcmilv0,t3_ehwk4k,1577776755.0,"Ah,  jetpack joyride"
todayilearned,fcmbn6h,t1_fcmb2wm,1577769715.0,"Oh don't worry about that at all :)

  I realised that my wording was off and instead of using 'not customary',  I should have just said it was not generally accepted :)  I don't know if that happens usually anywhere else. 

Thank you so much for replying.  I keep getting people telling me the same as you and I feel bad for my bad wording so I am glad that you can see my point!"
todayilearned,fcmbbhi,t1_fcm5c5a,1577769434.0,"I'm so sorry,  I live in London and tipping being 'expected'  was wrong of me to say.  I have been asked before if I'd like to leave a tip and I sometimes feel pressured into doing so.  My point with this post was that tipping would most likely not  be accepted in Japan as I found out that tipping could insult or confuse the wait staff."
todayilearned,fcmawv4,t1_fcm57bj,1577769076.0,"Oh,  no from the UK :)  

The point I was meant to put across was that tipping wouldn't really be accepted in Japan,  as I heard learnt that waiters/waitresses may find it insulting or confusing.  I'd never heard of that happening before but used the wrong wording for my title"
todayilearned,fclrfz4,t1_fclj0su,1577754662.0,Oh that's so lovely :)
todayilearned,fcldaq9,t1_fclczfu,1577745150.0,"Oh thank you!  I was  worried that I had worded myself wrong so thank you so much for confirming for me :)  I haven't been to Japan,  but went to a Japanese diner recently in London and was ao suprsed to see many signs telling me not to tip and that of a tip was left that it would be given to a charity.  I found that so bizzare :)  I find it strange that you yourself have mostly not been prompted to tip :)"
todayilearned,fclcesz,t1_fclc5as,1577744583.0,Thank you!  I'm getting myself into a tizzy as most people think that I meant just that
todayilearned,fclc8sj,t1_fcl7j51,1577744476.0,"Oh wow,  I didn't know that!  My partner and I are due for our Simpsons rewatch again soon so I will hopefully remember to look out for that :)"
todayilearned,fclbwoc,t1_fclba89,1577744259.0,I realised that I worded my TIL wrong :)  i should have said that tipping wouldn't be an accepted practice in Japan.  In some cases it could be insulting to the waiters/waitresses
todayilearned,fclbmts,t1_fclap8v,1577744082.0,"Just recently I went to  restaurant chain Strada where when paying the waitress gave me the card machine and on the machine it asked whether I wanted to tip or not.  This has happened on quite a few places that I have been to.  My point with this post,  the thing that suprised me the most, was that in Japan  you would be explicitly told not to tip and the tips would most likely not be accepted and that was what I wanted to put across in this post.  I've never had a UK restaurant decline a tip and that's what I was surprised about :)  I should have worded my post differently,  and rather than saying 'not customary'  I should have said that tipping wouldn't be acceptable :)"
todayilearned,fcl5lub,t1_fcl5a1h,1577740311.0,"This is what I meant also,  I think I was unclear.  By 'not customary'  I meant that I had learnt that tips would be frowned upon.  I should have added that!"
todayilearned,fcl4pt0,t1_fcl0gir,1577739761.0,Just dig them a hole through to the opposite side.  I'm sure being upside down for a while will be enough for them to be tipped.
todayilearned,fcl3s44,t1_fckyhva,1577739175.0,"Sorry I guess I didn't make myself clear,  I was more suprised to learn that tipping wouldn't be accepted in Japanese culture as opposed to it merely being 'not customary'  :)"
todayilearned,fckzwjy,t1_fckzfck,1577736782.0,"In the UK,  a tip is usually asked for at least at the restaurants that I have been to.  It is optional,  but it wouldn't be turned away.  I guess I was more suprised that I was told not to tip,  and that a tip wouldn't be accepted :)"
todayilearned,fckxwln,t1_fckxdqp,1577735554.0,"Oh no!  Hopefully she knew that you weren't trying to cause offence.   I haven't been to Japan (one day, hopefully)  but was told not to tip when I went to a Japanese diner here in the UK.  

Me too :( I'm also out of instant ramen"
todayilearned,fckxeuo,t1_fckwrsc,1577735253.0,"Oh my goodness,  the tipping system is horrendous in the US.  I always knew that 'it was bad' but didn't look into 'why' myself. Thank you for that! I'm in the UK and it's optional to tip but sometimes I almost feel pressured to.  Oh,  and there is also a service charge which I think that you can choose not to pay."
todayilearned,fckx0vo,t1_fckvlrq,1577735015.0,"I would love to have seen that.  I live in the UK and went to a Japanese diner here a few months back and there were notices in the shop window,  on tables AND on the menu to NOT tip.  Which was quite strange for me!"
ThriftStoreCats,fa1dhzk,t3_e781gn,1575768432.0,Or a cat stand for cats! :)
