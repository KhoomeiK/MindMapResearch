There is no national police force in America (aside from federal agencies like FBI, but they are not really a police force). Every place funds and runs its own police by their own rules. So depending on where you live, the results vary.

If you live in a small and quiet rural town that has maybe 5 officers total, who mostly fuck around doing nothing, they will be at your door minutes after the call. If you live in a big city that is funding their police force properly, like New York or Los Angeles, you will also get swift response.

If you however live in a poor town or a bankrupt city, and they don't have funds to properly staff and maintain their police force (like in a suburbs of Detroit a few years back), you may wait hours for them to show up or they won't show up at all."

Again, it's not wrong that they are sharing. It's the manner in which they do - by choosing the form they chose, they are being controversial, even if they did not intend so.

As for the photographers, you are using false analogy. The JOB (you know, the thing OTHER people tell you to do) of a photojournalist is to document things, even death or human suffering. Their subjects are not their close ones. If a photojournalist would share HIS wife's suffering in the manner we see here, they would be criticized the same way.

Also, photojournalist really don't ""profit off"" of images of suffering. The publisher is the one who profits from the photos. Photojournalists in the vast majority of the cases are not doing it solely for the money, and the money they make is rather shitty. You can live on it, but there are very few photojournalists who are really wealthy (and in the few cases they are, it usually went the other way - rich people who decided to be photographers).

That makes around 200 innocents of the 8000 people who were sentenced to death by US authorities.

I find it deeply ironic, that Americans are (rightfully so) criticizing Iran and China and other authoritarian governments for their control over information without going a second step and realizing that authoritarian regimes are doing it so that their people don't share information that would be harmful to their control over the population.

Both Chinese and Iranian government are afraid that free press and free speech could lead population to sharing and discussing inconvenient things, and could lead to protests and opposition to power.

They are afraid that their populations would overthrow them if they had access to free media.

Meanwhile in the US the President is freely confessing to crimes on the TV and during interviews and tweets threats of war crimes.

What does it say about the Chinese and Iranians?

And what does it say about Americans?"

It is entirely possible that if they didn't have compulsory voting the idiots in power would be even worse. We can't draw any conclusions from these examples.

Besides, compulsory voting is generally a good thing but only with accompanying civil education, which is kind of a joke in US right now. Most people don't understand the different areas of state vs. federal responsibilities, and yet we expect them to have reasonable opinions about matters that are much more complex, it's absurd.

Rarely a problem is solved by only a single factor.

To keep with election examples: an idea to present some kind of ID in order to cast a vote is a good one and helps in prevention of fraud (and it is used in pretty much all of Europe). 

What people forget is that with that you also need to have mechanisms in place that provide people with an ID and that it is the responsibility of the government, not of the citizen. Otherwise it is just a way to deny voting for people who live somewhere remote, are working too much and don't have time to deal with this, are poor or not mobile for other reasons.

So, if you present only one facet of the idea, people will form their opinion on the matter without taking all the details into account. And hence there are two sides, one that criticizes the idea because it will be a form of disenfranchisement (ignoring the potential benefits), and the other side who only sees it as a way to combat fraud (ignoring the potential risk).

Neither perspective is complete and neither is honest."
worldnews,fcyeh9p,t1_fcy8h4p,1578078926.0,"> spineless cowards. They swore an oath to protect the constitution and country from foreign and domestic threats. The president is a foreign-owned criminal. Proved and re-proved.

Yeah, and in contrast to Cheeto-in-Chief, they are not willing to break the law and US Constitution. The law says that he is their commander and that they are to do as he tells, unless it is clearly against the law. A strike targeting an Iranian general in Baghdad, even if beyond any reason and logic, is not directly against American law.

In a case when President is a foreign agent and acting against the interest of United States, the legal way is for the Congress to immediately remove him from office.

So the proper way to do this is for the Americans to go to the Capitol and demand that people like Moscow Mitch and Lindsey Graham uphold the law, and don't back off until the proper actions are taken.

But we know that Americans will never do that, because they never did at any point in the past when they were send to die by the lies of Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon or Bush. They will just take it in the ass like they always do and bitch about it on social media. That's it.

Now that I think of this, in this regard Americans are very similar to Russians, actually. Only the Russians at least have the excuse that their media and journalists are controlled by the government, or murdered if they are trying to be too independent and report on something the bozos at the top don't like.

What is your excuse, America?

As someone who works in advertising, this statement could not be farther from the truth. There are many factors that influence how the vast majority of people spend their money, and being rational about their needs is at the very bottom.
