It changed color, it became very red, and you have this poor guy, 80 years old, laying on the floor, conscious, and all of the rich people are turning away, â€˜Oh my god, this is terrible, this is disgusting,â€™ and, you know, theyâ€™re turning away, nobody wants to help the guy, and his wife is screaming, she sitting right next to him and sheâ€™s screaming.â€
