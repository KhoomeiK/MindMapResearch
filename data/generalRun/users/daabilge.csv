Greyhounds,fffmygu,t1_fffe9ja,1579887431.0,"So we aren't exactly a rescue, more of a rehab group. There is an adoption kennel associated with the track and a few rescues in the area that help place retired racers into homes. We specialize in taking badly injured dogs from the track and placing them in foster care while they recover, and then once they're recovered we coordinate with an adoption agency to place them in a home - or they get adopted by their foster parents. We have a lot of foster fails.

Before our program existed, most of the dogs that fractured during races were just euthanized. This is a joint effort between the state veterinarian who works on the track and a group of veterinary students. The state veterinarian has done a really incredible job getting these dogs to us and also raising funds so we can keep doing our work. She does so much to raise funds and pay for the surgeries and aftercare on all of our dogs.

We take the cases that need surgery since we're limited on funds and most rescue agencies can treat nonsurgical injuries but can't provide specialist surgeries. This dog had a weird fracture - radius and ulna with dislocation - while most of our dogs fracture the right hock just based in the stresses that racing places on the body. I think she fractured trying to avoid a dog that fell in front of her during the race. The bandage is stabilizing and protecting the surgery site while she recovers, and she has a basket muzzle because you can't really fit greyhounds with a cone and they're used to being muzzled on a track anyway."

We send them home with caution and directions for safely introducing the dog to cats even if they pass our cat test because all of our dogs are recovering from orthopedic surgery when we cat test and they might respond differently once they're feeling better and can walk normally again."

Obsoletus marked at $35 and CB Nerodia go for $40. Some of the less coveted thamnophis ssp go for around $40. Even my Thai beauties were $70 and $85 for the male and female respectively, and both were CB from reputable breeders. I really only see the big price tags on things like MBKs, milks, corn morphs, and hoggies. 

Also it seems steep for WC Asian vines in my experience. The ones I've seen at my expo are $15 or 2/$25, and they're usually in visibly poor body condition. The guy also sells tokays and someone told me it's because they use Asian vine snakes and tokays to cover imports for more valuable/less legal species at customs since the customs officers won't want to inspect a whole box of angry tokays and Asian vine snakes, so they're basically living packing peanuts to those dealers.."

aww,ff3ghu0,t1_ff3bmml,1579540553.0,"This is actually weirdly true. The service I used to work for at my old hospital had a company picnic that was dog friendly and we had around a dozen pits, one Newfoundland, and then one person had chocolate, black, and yellow labs and a golden retriever. I think it's because they were mostly young doctors recently out of residency and so they're all still pretty far in debt so they got shelter dogs, and the shelter in SE Michigan was mainly pit mixes, but also it seems like a lot of them wanted laid back, older dogs that would work with the doctor lifestyle.

Vet school is weird though because we have the pure breed enthusiasts who would never be caught dead with a rescue and then the rescue dog of choice seems to be former racing greyhounds because they get free food and preventatives as blood donors. Still a fair number of pitties but mainly distributed among the shelter med people."

Also if your selection of things you can buy on food stamps is limited to the weird selection of most convenience stores, the sushi is probably a fairly responsible option anyway. In undergrad, when I couldn't bum a ride to the real grocery store, I went to a Walgreens where the frozen section was limited to pizza rolls, pizza bagels, frozen pizza, wings, Mac and cheese bites, and other frozen appetizers and then ice cream and popsicles. The rest of the store was mostly chips, donuts, and snack foods, and then they had a small grocery section with a few shelves and a cooler with a small selection of basic groceries - bread, eggs, milk, kraft singles, butter, cereal, a few dry and canned goods, never fresh fruit or vegetables.

memes,feo154f,t1_fenjqkr,1579293635.0,"See I think she has the potential to lift it in future movies, but not as she currently is, and that's in part because they made her so overpowered. It's the Superman trap. In order for her character to be compelling there needs to be some potential for her to lose, and she lacks physical weaknesses, so basically they're forced to go either the route of taking away her powers (which they kind of did in the first one?) or focusing on her character flaws to give her something to lose. It's only really fun to watch someone who can't lose fight at full power for a little bit, then it gets boring - that's why she was gone for so much of endgame and why she only gets to full power at the end of captain marvel. So basically in future movies expect her to either make some mistake because of her impulsiveness that puts a loved one in danger or for there to be some totally-not-Kryptonite thing that drains her powers. Her personal flaws are necessary for her to have her own separate movies and have there be any actual conflict, but they preclude her from lifting the hammer..


I also think the writers used it to make a statement about the character - Thor was still able to summon the hammer to his own surprise because he thought he was unworthy, but it made the statement that his depression didn't define him. Likewise Cap can lift it in Endgame after working past the issues he had with Iron Man from Ultron and Civil War - he's finally ready to stop fighting, and it's the same personal change that convinces him to stay in the past and retire from the avengers. Vision can lift it because he's created as a purely good entity, but that's also why he doesn't have his own movies, and why I think in the series coming out he'll be more of a foil to Wanda, because vision on his own would be boring as an all-powerful being without character flaws."

Just coordinate with the university before you transfer so you don't get screwed out of credits you've earned. Same with AP courses; AP US History didn't give me credit for college US history, just departmental credits in the history department that didn't count for anything because I was required to have a class in that department, not an amount of credits, my AP English got me out of the English credit requirement but didn't count for the writing core class which was enough for the English requirement so it basically didn't count for anything, and a 5 on Calc BC didn't get me out of calculus, just 8 credits of ""non-university mathematics"" that got registered as an unlabeled pass/fail 099 course on my transcript.

The AP classes did get me out of general bio, gen chem, and intro physics which was nice because I could start with orgo and fill out my credit requirements with some cool electives like Orgo 3 and biophysical models for cell disease, so I would still recommend them!

Play behavior in non avian reptiles is still a field of active and somewhat controversial research, but best practices suggest providing appropriate enrichment to all animals to provide appropriate mental stimulation, which is why I provide all of my snakes with interactive aspects of their environment (toys), climbing space, and species-specific enrichment such as food hides, simulated nest raids, burrows, and tunnels.

Play in this sense is defined as ""repeated, incompletely functional behavior differing from more serious versions structurally, contextually, or ontogenetically, and initiated voluntarily when the animal is in a relaxed or low stress state"" and has been reputably observed in varanids, chelonians, and crocodilians.

insanepeoplefacebook,fe2ea1n,t1_fe2ai65,1578837397.0,"Someone explained it really well above - basically, if you referred to it as ""trans"" and ""normal"" you marginalize the trans community in the same way as if you referred to other identities as ""normal"" and ""variant"" - think of how you'd feel if you were a person of color and people said you're either black or normal, or if you were left handed and people said left handed or normal, or if you're gay and someone says you can be gay or normal. It's a technical term and probably not an identity you spend a ton of time thinking about, but it's there because humans love categories and binaries.

WhitePeopleTwitter,fd98d8k,t1_fd6e4o2,1578229843.0,"They keep making changes that make it harder for us to afford, too. When I started out we had a campus used bookstore, amazon and a bunch of other places to get cheap used textbooks instead of buying new from the bookstore or piracy for free ones, although my university decided to counter that by making brand new coursepacks mandatory every semester and selling them only from the university store for like $80 each. There was literally no difference between the different semester coursepacks except the color of the cover but you couldn't buy used because profit - you'd get a zero for the discussion section grade without the newest coursepack. They also made ""looseleaf"" copies of the textbooks that were slightly cheaper (it was 250 instead of 300 for my genetics book), but then they were ineligible for the buyback program at the end of the semester - which they didn't tell you when buying. Or if the class had a textbook they would mandate an online homework key that only came with a new copy of the text. 

Then they wondered why we had protests saying the university was unfair to low SES students.. I had a few good professors like the one for biophysics who wrote her own textbook then told us how to download it for free but I had a bunch more that just bought into the system because they really didn't care."

memes,fcyoc6j,t1_fcy49im,1578083814.0,You're thinking of mourning geckos - they're an all-female species that reproduce by parthenogenesis. It has also been documented in a few species of varanids and I think in crocodilians.
memes,fcyo56w,t1_fcy38qk,1578083708.0,"Well, for starters God didn't create humans. Also not all creatures have ""two genders"" - some of our plants and fungi have wild numbers of sexes, especially when you get into extreme polyploidy, while some animal species have just one sex - like mourning geckos, which are exclusively female and produce by parthenogenesis, or slugs and snails, which produce both sperm and eggs. In some species of salmon there are actually two different types of males depending on environmental factors.

The reason most species have two sexes is more just a factor of how multicellularity and sexual reproduction evolved in diploid cells, so meiosis ends up creating haploid gametes - however, mitochondria divide by fission, so gametes differentiated into one bearing the mitochondria and one that just bears the second set of chromosomes. Nick Lane explains really well in his book ""Power, Sex, and Suicide: Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life"" how mitochondria shaped the development of sexual reproduction. However, if, say, tetraploidy were commonplace instead and cells had developed a different way to approach energy constraints of building larger bodies, in this hypothetical world we might see the evolution of 4 different sexes with haploid gametes, or we might see the development of diploid gametes and two sexes like we have here, or maybe both would evolve and diverge from an original tetraploid ancestor. Kind of a cool thought experiment.

Also it's not like the only reason for sex is reproduction, sex can be part of a healthy relationship - or not, if that's what you decide - and is quite enjoyable for both parties when done correctly. In fact, in bonobos - one of our closest evolutionary relatives - sex is often used as social currency or for conflict resolution or for bonding within a social group and intercourse between members of the same sex has been reported. We're a prosocial species, sex and sexual preference is a major factor in how we interact with each other."
