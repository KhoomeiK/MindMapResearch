Marriage,fgxa6dv,t1_fgvddil,1581170684.0,Absolutely agree. I didn’t mean to imply that you can’t have fun with your kids. I probably laugh more with my kids than I do with anyone else. It’s just not my Job to be their friend. First priority is to raise them right.
Marriage,fgudeo2,t3_f0d7l4,1581118093.0,"I just realized that I didn’t even answer your question... how you should relay your feelings to your wife. 
I would first make her hear that you understand she likes their cuddles and affection. She needs to know that you aren’t just telling her you think what she does is wrong, you understand the why, but you think there still needs to be an adjustment. 
Explain to her that you feel like The current routine makes the relationship between the two of you worse. 
Then explain to her that you believe in the long run this will also make the parent child relationship More difficult. The longer you allow the kids to remain in your bed, the harder it will be to break the habit. Causing anxiety on the child’s end and stress on the parents end. 
Try to come up with a game plan. Ex: no napping after 4pm, 1 hr of tv/cuddle time in the living room before the child goes to bed.... whatever you guys think will work. It can’t be a one way street"
Marriage,fgtefyu,t1_fgsydn1,1581103362.0,"This. 
My kids were never allowed to sleep in my bed even though my husband would have been fine with that, I was not. 
I’ve said it many times, to my kids, And to my friends...It is not my job to be their friend, it is my job to raise a child that will grow into a well adjusted, functioning and contributing member of society. 
A healthy bedtime routine is part of life."
CabinPorn,fgra7vd,t1_fgqtoze,1581041904.0,My husband and I have been casually looking for a cabin. Not quite ready yet. But look in different areas that would be close enough for weekend getaways. Do you like the hedgesville area?  That’s not far from us

maryland,fgpl6fm,t3_eztghf,1581007014.0,There’s a lot of cabins for rent in the Shenandoah Valley area. Gorgeous views. Just nice to relax and unwind. We’ve done a couple weekends there just my husband and I.
frederickmd,fgpkmzv,t3_ezuhns,1581006701.0,"I’m Not positive, but you could check Ballenger Creek Park on the weekends once spring hits. I always see adults out there playing soccer, and they aren’t wearing uniforms so I doubt it’s a league."
