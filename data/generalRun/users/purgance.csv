Unfortunately things are rarely that simple (it's America, after all, the fine print is the difference between rich and poor).  To reward decision makers for 'screening' mortgages for capital holders, you have to pay fees to start up a loan (seems kind of paradoxical, I know - I'm paying you for the privilege of paying you to borrow money from you).  There are also ongoing costs of maintaining a home beyond the mortgage payment (things like homeowners insurance, mortgage insurance (in case you default), budgeting for emergency repairs (plumbing, broken windows/doors, air conditioning, etc) which substantially increase the cost of purchasing a home.  

Full time, yes, you can but it would be tight.  You would want to find some form of down payment assistance, with that and a year or two of aggressive savings you would be good.  

Part time, (as you noted in the comments under your question), no, you cannot.  It would be difficult in the extreme to make the payments on a home, afford the ancillary costs, and support yourself working part time (let alone a family).  

The 'right direction' is to work more hours.  It used to be possible to get a low wage job like the one you have and make the payments necessary, but the proliferation of 'overhead' costs (rent seeking by capital holders - basically, this is the process of attaching ongoing payments to things that don't need them), but it isn't.  

That said, part time school and part time college...IME you do one full time and the other part time, not both part time.  Maybe the boomers would laze around like this, but since the millenials took over the average young person is working ~60 hours a week, not 40."
