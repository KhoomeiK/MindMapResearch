unpopularopinion,ff5kad7,t1_ff5k1hb,1579596927.0,"I actually don't play LoL at all, or any other game really, I just enjoy watching people play on youtube and whenever a youtuber goes and demolishes someone from silver/gold when they are challenger, it seems to me 100% not fair."
unpopularopinion,ff5jx6x,t1_ff5jsmc,1579596402.0,"I don't agree about MMos. I haven't played any for a long time (like 10 years), but I remember in PvP servers that people would camp at low lvl training grounds and even not in PvP servers they would come to PvP battlegrounds with the best gear on earth and you would never have a chance. 
PvP should not be who had the best gear but who is the best skilled (for the appropriate time they play)"
WeightLossAdvice,fefuy9l,t3_eoxji3,1579066024.0,"I want to tell you my #1 tip on that matter.
I used to say ""fuck it"" a while lot as well, like everytime I was hungry and a little moody, I would order a whole pizza/burger whatever. 
Then I realized I only did this when I'm hungry and don't have anything to eat, so I decided that I will always, always always have something healthy and filling on me just in case this happens. 
I'm a student. I usually don't get hungry until like 12pm-1pm (i do intermittent fasting), but even if I have class only until 11am I pack my lunch with me in case i get extremely hungry during the day.  I would rather eat my lunch at 11 and not bing than to go buy a snack at the vending machine because fuck it I'm hungry.

It was really useful for me, and i hope it might be for you too."

Lots of ice, lemon juice, mint and frozen pineapples. Freaking incredible. Its basically lemonade with pineapple. 10/10"
WeightLossAdvice,fed0ldb,t3_eofjt5,1578992671.0,"You don't gain weight because you eat sugar..
You gain weight because you eat excess calories. Just make sure you don't eat more than you burn and you will be ok."
intermittentfasting,fed0eit,t3_eoimle,1578992408.0,After 48 hours your brain starts using ketones as energy and not glucose. That's why until the 48 hour mark you usually feel like shit.
unpopularopinion,feczy8y,t1_feczwn9,1578991787.0,Unfortunately that's not 100% true.
unpopularopinion,feczugf,t1_fecyr96,1578991642.0,"Not really..
Not enough to be worth it. I used to work in hightech, trust me, the #1 joke we had was about people who take those degrees."

You have a general Md degree and afterwards you choose a speciality (Psych, pediatrics, etc..)

I'm definitely not defending gender studies, they are horrible. I'm just saying that there are many many others that are just the same."
unpopularopinion,fecz96n,t1_fecz56g,1578990852.0,"I'm saying that there are so many useless worthless degrees other than gender studies.

Philosophy is a great example"
