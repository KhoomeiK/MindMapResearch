How is it not obvious that the reason she gets criticism is that she is flown all over to give speeches and demonstrations, and does it in a rather confrontational way of mostly telling people what they are doing wrong and shaming them?  That would probably rub some people the wrong way who just don't like being chastised by this girl who is just repeating what other people tell her to be angry at them for, but who otherwise agree with her sentiments.

There are people who may see that things are happening with the environment and want to look at what could be done different, then this privileged girl comes up and starts yelling at people how bad they are for not doing anything and it turns them off the idea.  People's criticism of her isn't that she dares to talk about climate change, most critics don't like that she is just a parroting mouthpiece as you acknowledged and she has no formal education to really know the ramifications of all her 'calls to action'."
