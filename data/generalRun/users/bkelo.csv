depression,fdiadv8,t1_fdg2d6h,1578438620.0,It's good to hear things are getting better... Hope it stays that way. I still haven't found the courage to tell my family about being depressed but i have a couple of friends who know and i hope I'll be able to tell them soon.
depression,fdia0sx,t1_fdfe7na,1578438430.0,True

depression,fclqnj0,t1_fclou9l,1577754112.0,Maybe I should try by doing small tasks hopefully something changes
depression,fcllhu1,t3_cml6ni,1577750578.0,Anyone else feel passive in life? Like their life is just going on without you really being in it. I just can't get myself to do anything anymore and it's been like this for quite some time and i don't know how much longer i want to live like this
depression,fcll8nu,t3_ehpwn0,1577750405.0,"Happy birthday

If u ever want to talk about anything on your mind im here

I don't celebrate my birthday either but it's just because i can't find the energy to do anything anymore and it's really bad but the only thing that keeps me going is hope that it'll get better one day and i hope it's gonna be the same for you"
depression,fclkosp,t3_ehotyn,1577750032.0,Been feeling the same for quite a while now
depression,fclk2od,t1_fcljl6v,1577749625.0,I know how you feel been the same for quite some time now.. I feel in some way hollow and passive (not sure which words to use to describe it) but basically i feel like I'm not really going anywhere with my life and i cant get myself to do anything productive like its really hard every morning to even find the will to get out of bed. Hope it goes away soon cuz i don't think I'll live like this much longer
depression,fclim1v,t1_fclgs5b,1577748651.0,Yeah i don't know what im waiting for either... Whats on may 17th if i can ask
depression,fcirfus,t1_fciqoh8,1577668049.0,Damn... I'm not sure i can do much else but wish you luck with your friend and hope it works out. It might take some time but it'll work out just believe in that. If you need help with anything feel free to ask
depression,fciqgox,t1_fcipu2x,1577667382.0,Maybe just try to invite them to go out for a drink like idk coffee or something because making the first move could show that they really mean a lot to you. Also try to explain and apologise for what happened and remember there isn't really anything to lose by trying. Besides its almost new year and they'll want their best friend back
depression,fcipa4o,t1_fciof3p,1577666606.0,Ohh maybe time is really what they need u know. If it happened a few days ago maybe they're thinking about the event and they'll realize its just something that happens to everyone and they'll want to speak to you about it.
depression,fcio66h,t1_fcimvc1,1577665939.0,Try to explain what you were going through at the time and they'll understand... Just an honest and open talk is the best thing to do.
depression,fcima9p,t3_cml6ni,1577664945.0,I don't remember what being happy was like
