Cardinals,feuw92q,t1_fetuvub,1579390545.0,"Those are better, but are highly correlated with OPS that I am fine with judging based on OPS when presented with it easily where the alternative is spending time to look those up. (For instance OPS is actually often included in TV graphics whereas wOBA and wRC+ are not as often)"

news,feeokfy,t1_feenudx,1579037950.0,"AES is not only different from DES in key length. While side channel attacks have occurred against specific implementations, current hardware would require billions of years to crack AES with 128 bit keys when the implementation protocol takes precautions against related key attacks. And the effort required to increase bits in the key, while non trivial, is significantly easier than making hardware equivalently faster. If we were still using DES you’d have a point. But unless there’s a mathematical flaw that’s gone public ally unnoticed, current off the shelf GPU’s cannot tough it. It would require an unknown technique or a level of hardware improvement that would shock the world."

news,fednxef,t1_fedlrak,1579016078.0,"Future sure. But unless the encryption is implemented incorrectly, or someone has a computer orders of magnitude faster than what we in the public know of super computers being capable of currently, there is no known way to break good encryption now. You can mathematically prove how many cycles it takes. So unless someone is capable of orders of magnitude more cycles than we know of, or there is a glaring implementation flaw that means the encryption actually running differs from their definitions, it is unbreakable currently."

worldnews,fdqudkr,t1_fdqfk8v,1578675047.0,"It’s about as far out from a general election as it’s possible to be. It’s not like he’s campaigning on this. He’s trying to convince his party members to support him, not run an election campaign. I don’t see how it’s bad politics if it will be completely forgotten by the next election."
worldnews,fdpg8m5,t1_fdpfpj5,1578627823.0,Yeah extortion is illegal. What does that have to do with calls to action? A call to action is an exhortation not extortion.

worldnews,fdpex2i,t1_fdpepuh,1578626863.0,He just means conservatives are mad people online are mean to them. Because when people are mean to you that’s censorship. So complaining about getting made fun of is championing free speech.
politics,fdi4p09,t1_fdi4log,1578435685.0,Only in caucuses. Ie not in general elections there. Plus you don’t just leave a list you have to stay there the whole time and physically walk across the room to your second choice.
politics,fdi4fg1,t1_fdhu98i,1578435547.0,In IA if your candidate doesn’t get 15% you move to your second choice. That’s part of what differentiates a Caucas from a primary. So if she doesn’t get 15% her caucusers can move to their second choice. It’s not about dropping out

nfl,fd9zr9f,t1_fd7ywd5,1578240006.0,15 cuz the previous penalty was at 5:15 so doing another penalty before the 5 minute mark resets the clock after only 15 rolled off so itd buy 15 seconds.
