movies,fgnzstw,t1_fgnqfgt,1580956531.0,"I've been lucky. I've had 37 years and counting. As I get to know my parents more, what starts to come out is their flaws. I don't mean that in a negative way. When you're young your parents tend to hide this from you (at least mine did), or you're just blind to it. As I've gotten older my parents have started to share their fears, shortcomings, and vulnerabilities. I see them as human. This is a perspective I would have loved to see growing up. A lot of my own internal struggles are with perfectionism and feeling like 'not enough' when I was young and trying to measure up to my parents. I now see that they had those same feelings and struggles. I think having that perspective at a younger age would have been extremely helpful, but at least I got to see it first hand eventually.

It was actually just a couple months ago, when I was 37 that my dad told me some things about his father... my grandfather. It sounds like he was on... I think it was lithium... for some kind of psychiatric issues, and this was back in the '60s before it was common. This was very interesting for me to hear. I've been struggling internally for as long as I can remember. I brought something up once about ADHD (ADD at the time) and got a response of ""no son of mine has ADD, you'e fine"".... which may very well have been true, but that stuck with me and I never brought anything up on the subject of my feelings. I just carried the load alone. Now that I know there may be a family history, I don't know if I should say something or not.... in the same conversion he talked about various mental conditions being ""pathetic""... which maybe he didn't mean in a shameful way, and meant he couldn't help but feel legit pity for them, but I don't want my dad to pity me....

Being a ""true fan"" is meaningless... and calls back to the ""[no true Scotsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman)"" fallacy. The only thing that matters is if they win the election or not.

Those people might have not been ""true fans"" of Bernie, but they weren't true fans of Trump either.

I actually took notes when I was there. Here were my lessons learned that you might find useful.

* Have a time and place to relax. In London, much like NYC, everyone is always in a hurry and you always feel like you should be somewhere.
* Have shoes made for walking a lot (I bought new shoes while I was there)
* If washing clothes in the sink, get stuff that dries fast. A cotton shirt would dry over night, but socks took longer. Look into getting wool everything.
* A sweatshirt can be too warm. If you are going to have one, make it a zip one to let in air. Maybe get a better fabric that doesn't overheat...
* If traveling to an area with public transit, check the lines to see where you want to go and stay near a stop on a central line.
* Before booking with AirBnB, consider the value in housekeeping, supply of incidentals, and the 0 guilt when contacting the front desk with issues.
* If going with something like AirBnB, bring a basic keychain incase the one supplied is stupid (they had this giant stuffed bear as a keychain, it was super annoying)
* If going for an extended stay, try to be near a grocery store to get food or other items you may need during the stay.
* Sometimes walking around is good, but sometimes it is best to just take a seat and figure out your next steps. (I walked 13 miles my first day there)
* A money clip in the front pocket worked well for managing cards and cash without the need for a ""travel wallet"" or chain. This made things feel much more secure while also looking less like a tourist."

todayilearned,fg7amc1,t1_fg70rq8,1580587910.0,"Nothing is preventing you from taking some of your money and buying stock with it. Nothing is preventing you from using your money to buy any assets rather than liabilities. Just because the company doesn't give it to you directly, doesn't mean you can't take the money the company gives you and turn it into those assets you want. 

I have a fundamental disagreement with you on your assertion that the dollar amount a company pays for your time is the value of your time. I believe I stated this in my previous comment, but you didn't really address my points here.

It may be a fact that a company values your time at a certain level, but that has nothing to do with the value YOU place on your time. It also has little to do with the true value of your time... like I said, how much would you make if you didn't have the job?

I do get about 10% of my salary in the form of stock, but it's just another way to distribute money for work done. It still gets taxed, and in talking to financial professionals, they say to treat it the same as your payroll. Now, some of that stock may take 2-3 years to vest before I can touch it, and in that time the value may go up (it also may go down)... so there is risk involved. They could be giving you a net negative. But that wouldn't be functionally different than me taking the money they pay me and sticking it in the market myself for 2-3 years. Also, the stock isn't a way to say ""we're going to give you profit now so you can stop trading your time for money""... it far from it. The stock is saying, ""we want to lock you in so you feel trapped. If you think about leaving, you need to think about giving up all this stock we gave you that hasn't vested yet"". Every time I think of leaving my company I need to think abut being wiling to forfeit tens of thousands of dollars. Some refer to this ""problem"" as ""golden handcuffs"". It's a means of control. Do you really think that's better? I'd much rather have it just added on to my payroll so I get the money right away and can choose what I want to do with it, rather than feeling trapped, like I need to give something up to leave.

You seem very upset with this system, but also seem to be going out of your way to look at it in a way that will make you upset. The simple fact is you are leaving the job with more money than you showed up with. If you don't have any assets, the one thing everyone has is their time and effort. They can trade this for money. Every single founder of a company has traded an insane amount of their own time to get the company off the ground. They may have a lot of money now, but when they started all they had was their time and effort. Instead of complaining about it and taking a defeatist view that they aren't making anything from their efforts, they worked and created something, and now the no longer trade their time for money...... but they still work 24x7.... so they are now trading time to realize their vision. It also takes their time to keep the stock going up, because if the stock goes down all that money goes away. $100B of Jeff Bezos' wealth is in Amazon stock. The rise and fall of his wealth depends on him putting in the time and effort to keep the company on track to be better than it was. I can guarantee you Jeff Bezos works more hours than you ever have. He is still trading time for money in some respect, but that equation is then leveraged due to his stock holdings in the company. And everyone is free to buy stock in their own company, even if they don't get it as part of their compensation package."

I generally buy my plane tickets many months in advance without really thinking about it. As the trip gets closer I'm never excited... I don't want to go... I'm scared. But I already bought the ticket so I suck it up and go. Not once have I ever regretted it. It's always an amazing experience, and then when the next deal comes up I book another trip and start it over again. I have been on a half dozen or so solo trips all over the world. I have one coming up in 2 months... right now, I don't want to go... but I will go, and I'll be glad I went.

At times you will not know what to do. At times you will probably feel awkward. But at the end of the day, you'll figure it out, you'll learn, you'll grow. It will get easier, but more importantly, you'll learn to trust that you will figure it out.

todayilearned,fg5sxp0,t1_fg5r82n,1580537692.0,"A customer pays my company. My company pays me. Part of my pay goes toward taxes. Thus, customers pay my taxes...

>but if you have $10 labor $15 in pay and pay $3 tax you still gain net $2

Where dose the extra $5 come from? I have no idea what your definition of ""profit"" is in this context. You keep using it, but never defined it, and it is pretty clear that it's different from any way I've heard profit used before.

Are you saying that a company gives you $10 in stock, the value of the stock goes up, so that $10 turns into $15? I get about $10k in stock each year, that isn't free money, it gets taxed at some point and I still have taxes come out of my pay check.

Your whole theory seems to be based on the idea that the value of your time is equal to the value your company places on your time. This can go a couple different ways.

If I value my time at $10/hr, but I'm getting paid $20/hr, would you consider that profit?

If I value my time at $20/hr, but only get $10/hr, is that a loss? Why do I value my time at that rate? When I'm not on the clock is it as good as burning $20/hr?

The simple fact is, the value of your time is exactly what you'd make on your own if you didn't have a formal job. If you are making $12k/year on your own, that's $1.37/hr. Anything you make above that by working for a company would be profit. The support system of the company allows you to make more than you could on your own.

This can be framed a thousand different ways. You can frame it in a way to hate the system and be pissed off. Or you can use it in a way to have some gratitude.

Personally, I'm not passionate enough about anything to do something on my own. I wouldn't make shit. I'd probably be an alcoholic living on the street, or would have killed myself year ago. So I work for a company that does try to do something and it gives me something to care about, to some degree. And if we define profit as the money that goes into my bank account... then I make more profit than I would otherwise. I'm selling the company my time and they give me more money than I'd make without them. Maybe that will change some point down the road for me, but that's where things stand right now. When I'm not working I'm making $0/hour... so anything over that is profit in my book. (technically speaking you could argue that they pay me 24x7 since I'm salary, but I try to create some boundaries)"
