Over the past year or so, I've noticed I picked up a bag habit of my mother's (talking over my father), and have began at least acknowledging when I do it myself and hope I start cleaning my behavior.

The closest I can think is that Clinton got impeached for getting a blow job in the oval office but didn't Trump cheat decades ago?

Edit: I was a child when Clinton was in office. I made that claim he was impeached for a blow job because that's the only thing I remember about it."
