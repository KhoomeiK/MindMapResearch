science,ffamaxx,t3_escr5k,1579739288.0,"Sadly, I’m not surprised. There are so many factors that can influence a call dispatcher recieves... which is then forwarded again to the officers. So much room for misinformation.

For anyone interested,
Malcom Gladwell’s “Talking to strangers” also has an interesting perspective on police violence."
dogs,ff9yr09,t3_esd28e,1579724385.0,I have a chow/shepherd/retriever mutt and he didn’t make any noise until 4-5 years old. He’s still a pretty quiet guy but I’ll hear him every now and again. I just assume some dogs just like to keep to themselves haha

solotravel,ff2eg9o,t3_eqyzto,1579502764.0,"Oh how I relate to this!!!

I’ll never forget, while on a trip I was walking past an arguing couple. After a minute or so of back and forth comments, the guys looks directly at his girlfriend and screams, “YOURE FUCKING UP THE ITINERARY!”

Nope. No thank you. Most people don’t know how to chill and ‘go with the flow’ when traveling and it is the saddest thing! 

Enjoy yourself!!"

relationships,fe19o1b,t3_enb5x0,1578824101.0,"I believe your feelings are warranted in this situation. It sounds like you’re in a stagnant spot in your life. While your wife is out experiencing new places in her new position, you’re stuck back at home focusing on your priorities (paying debt, etc.). But realize these feelings of ‘jealousy’ don’t have to be viewed as negative, but rather as a sign that you need to make your own changes. Use it as motivation. 

Take some time to think about your goals in the next few months/years. How can you improve your personal financial situation? Maybe pick up a side hustle. I understand the frustration of debt, but don’t forget to put aside some money for yourself; maybe a weekend getaway. Otherwise you’ll continue to burn yourself out (and what’s life without a bit of living, anyways?). Also, put some time into hobbies, they will save you when your wife is away!"

AmItheAsshole,fdyff23,t1_fdsvnps,1578779173.0,"Everyone really sucks here.

I can’t believe “NTA” is the top comment in this. Taking such drastic measures never solves anything. I feel like everyone here is forgetting what it’s like to be a teenager... that’s more likely to rebel more under these circumstances. And it sounds like OP did this more out of spite for his ex than to teach his daughter a lesson. (Whom, btw, sounds like to type of person who will continue letting your daughter drive behind your back, now without a license.)

You’ve now limited your daughter for the next two years, without giving her an opportunity to redeem herself/learn from her mistakes. You’ve also created more separation between you and your ex instead of trying to co-parent. Not a healthy example for your daughter. 

Take the time to gather videos/stories of the dangers of being a distracted driver. Sit your daughter down and EDUCATE her on safe driving practices."
