nextfuckinglevel,ffdvai7,t1_ffdrs8n,1579829808.0,Real unarmed combat training isn't fun.  Gurkhas teaching you how to collapse a persons esophagus so they will die silently obviously isn't a good way to stay in shape and spar a little bit.  An effective physical fitness regime with some competitive striking that doesn't leave you scared and broken is what 99% want to do.  The percentage of people who actually learn really brutally effective unarmed martial arts is very low.
AskReddit,ff9pn0b,t1_ff9dnpv,1579718133.0,The way I think of it after years in the army is that more water isn't always the answer but that dehydration always makes everything worse.

pics,fei73my,t1_feht45r,1579131751.0,Yeah... There are few places in the world that  legislatively and philosophically separate education and child poverty.  I'm guessing Kentucky is one of them.  Getting children educated despite economic circumstances is a primary goal of many education boards.  Saying that people don't graduate or go on to post secondary educations because of poverty and not blaming at least in part the board of education is horrifying.  That just means richer people schools are unequally funded as policy.
pics,fehrud1,t1_fehqqt7,1579122624.0,"I don't doubt it, but that doesn't address the fact that Kentucky is bottom 10% for High school graduation and Post secondary school graduation and bottom 5% for most elementary school statistics especially when it comes to literacy."
history,fehrefs,t1_fehmhtk,1579122370.0,"It is certainly up for good debate but if it wasn't Luther's actions and the events surrounding him it would have been someone else.  The political climate in central Europe was right for reform just in the 1510's to 20's.  Others had complained before and support for reform grew incrementally until, with Luther, the excommunication wasn't a political death sentence and he still had allies.  Remember he didn't want to have a split in the church, just specific reforms.  He was definitely not alone.  More importantly in the next few centuries (practically after just a few years) groups and demographics that supported him developed their own denominations differing from his teachings and each others.  This means that others did have the strength of will and determinations to develop their own ""canon"" regardless of Luther.  It would have been different in many small ways obviously but I don't see central Europe not having a religious schism with very similar protestant denominations starting any later than the 1560's at most."

baseball,febafsy,t1_fear1ts,1578956903.0,Cheating to win for the sake of winning is obviously bad but its effect on the sport is much less damaging than allowing it to be manipulated for betting lines.  Especially when those betting lines involve specific aspects of the game and not just straight winning.
baseball,fe9z9bg,t1_fe9wk8l,1578942759.0,I don't think they understand how much loosing the manager at this point in the year matters.  It's not like they can hire someone fantastic for 12 months.

How their jobs are described and the budgets they have to work with are the issue everyone has a problem with.
ABoringDystopia,fdnk9yl,t1_fdnhase,1578587571.0,"Yes, that is the municipal definition of a landlord and your are correct.  That has nothing to do with the philosophical economic definition of a landlord who is a person who does not reside at a property, has not developed the property, only minimum maintains the property but extracts a rent from it.  That is a person who is extracting wealth from the economic system but doesn't produce anything for it.  A person who is renting a part of the building they live in to someone else to make ends meet is not extracting wealth without any productivity, they are creating financial stability. 

The terms and words mean different things depending on the context and the Landlord Smith it talking about is a middle man who extracts wealth while creating nothing of profit."
ABoringDystopia,fdnfae3,t1_fdn5fbv,1578584572.0,The difference in terms of economic philosophy are very important.  The gouge vs doesn't gouge is also important but for different reasons.
ABoringDystopia,fdnf5um,t1_fdn1obm,1578584494.0,"In terms of municipal legality that is true.   But if you are renting out part of your domicile to pay the bills on it in terms of economic philosophy, especially in an historical context, you are room mates."

todayilearned,fdhj9i5,t1_fdhi7wh,1578423822.0,Imagine that... Yeah that would be weird.  What does that have to do with anything I'm saying.

Biological, cultural an personal choices allow those men's spouses/partners to take half in a divorce settlement = evil repressive government infringing on our basic rights!


That all adds up for you?"
todayilearned,fdgwtnw,t1_fdgs8uo,1578410280.0,So on one hand you are saying that in your lifetime there is no way that women will become equal top earners but on the other hand it's not fair that women get half of what top earners have in divorce settlements?

history,fcyjmmm,t1_fcy9f94,1578081174.0,"I'm not making any statements.  I can't sumerize 10,000 years of history on a post.  There are experts far more knowledge than me and better equipped to make a good point.  What I'm asking is why you are asserting something without any knowledge or subject expertise.  If someone asked what the smoking point of canola oil was and you said 300C because you felt that was a good answer even though you just pulled it out if your ass you would be passing on incorrect information just for fun.  This is no different, your just making stuff up because you feel like it is true.  It detracts from the entire point if the post.  Do you think that just because it is Reddit you shouldn't be called out for making up facts?"

I've read and studied the history of food extensively and written graded papers on the subject.  It is huge and complex and there is no way to properly answer all the nuances about it in anything smaller than the Cambridge encyclopedia of Food.  What evidence do you have to back up the claims you made in your first post.  It sounds like you are just writing what you feel is right because... you grew up with people who cooked and traveled a bit?  What does that have to do with the history or restaurants?  As well we know lots about how ""peasants"" lived, there is more than several life times worth of books and studies out there on the day to day lives of common people from around the world through out history.  Because you haven't read them doesn't mean they don't exist.  If you are making statements on a sub like this write about what you know, not what you think you feel is how things were."

history,fcwngwl,t1_fcwjhzz,1578030682.0,"Why do you believe that?  The truth is quite opposite and very complex from place to place but communal cooking more so than eating in urban areas has been the norm.  How many 15th century urbanites owned an oven for bread let alone other cooking?  How many towns with a 10,000 person population would have been burnt down because of the 2000 individual open cooking fires required to feed each separate dwelling.  As close as Victorian England virtually everyone baked bread and roasted meat in central kitchens and then brought them back to their houses.  The numbers eating and cooking together in cities is far greater than rural historically."
history,fcw2vq7,t1_fcto74d,1578015880.0,You're thinking of older historical times but with the lens of a post WWII Western economy.  Communal eating or cooking makes much more sense in almost all circumstances.

In other Western countries the sitting government is opposed to ANY climate change action.

People scraping together enough to have a limited plan or those who live too far out are simply not their core demographic.  It's not an indictment of those people it's just basic business.  I only know a couple of people who don't have unlimited internet at their house and the are all very young with bad credit and living less than paycheck to paycheck OR are farmers/retired artist in the middle of nowhere.
