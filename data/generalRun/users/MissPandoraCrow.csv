JUSTNOMIL,ffgmfw2,t3_ep4ugj,1579909638.0,"No, they definitely don’t see themselves as anything other then immediate family.
The JustNo’s anyway.

The second I got married my entire family took a step back, they said they would not disturb my husband and I as we were now the family unit but would love every second we invited them into our lives, and they have stuck with that.

My husbands parents became incredibly entitled, MIL will throw a fit if we don’t invite her over or go to see her. She demands to see us instead of asking and will play the victim if I in particular don’t drop everything I’m doing to be at her beck and call."

The thing is DH thinks his parents are overbearing, and manipulative but not malicious, so I would have to convince him that we need it. 

The other thing I was thinking of was an intercom front door cam, something I can play off as a purchase for something else and just store it in our bedroom where I can leave it running but that feels manipulative on my part"

In future I'm going to tell DH that if they are ever going to be in our home again he has to install a lock on our bedroom door.  

I may go back with my sister if enough of a stink is made, and we can start removing and sanding doors ready for them to be repainted but even thinking about being around that women makes me feel sick."

MurderedByWords,fel4med,t1_fekpwp8,1579213950.0,"Haha yeah sorry, she is 1/1,024th Native American. 
She is less Native American than the average american, so by Elizabeth Warren's standards the average american is also a Native american. 

Also I'm not an American so the ""Stop pushing Trump's racist lies."" is a little ludicrous since I have no involvement what so ever in American politics and couldn't even if I wanted to. 

The fact of the matter here is that Warren is not in anyway a Native American and she had to apologise to the Native American population as her claiming to be one and then bring out a DAN test to say she may have had some ancestor up to 10 generations ago (meaning 300 years ago by the way) was a very offensive insult to actual Native Americans.

So yeah. She Lied"

She lied about her kids going to public schools when they went to privet schools. 

She lied about being fired from her job for being pregnant when the board unanimously offered her a second year contract and she resigned.

She claimed her parents had to elope due to her mums ""obvious Indian heritage"" and the ""white bigotry of her fathers family""  to spite a photo of her mother being clearly white and a dna test proving she had no Native american ancestry.

She made multiple submissions to a cook book under the name ""Elizabth Warren - Cherokee"

motherinlawsfromhell,fei05ev,t3_ep4q2s,1579127418.0,"Honestly I'd hold your ground, start the way you mean to finish and if you don't want to spend the rest of your life being disrespected and treated badly then you need to set the standard now that you can't and won't be treated that way.  


Edited to add: A lot of people are saying you should divorce your husband and I think that should be a last resort BUT I do think you should have a serious talk with your husband and make him understand that if he continues the way he is going and does not stand by you as a single family unit with you and baby that divorce is where you will end up very VERY quickly.   
At which point he will be living with his mother for the rest of his life.   


Sometimes people need a kick up the ass to open their eyes, and to change most people need something to run towards **AND** **something to run from**.   
Make him see how bad his life will get if he does not stand up for you and baby, explain to him in great detail the hell he is walking into willingly, terrify him with the reality of his current choices.   


If then he does not start running away from her and towards you, only then is it time to file for divorce."

The receptionist is the culprit, he does all this (apart from Reddit) that I started on my own because no one can see my computer screen but they can see me wearing headphones, I thought it was a better look to be not wearing headphones and typing a comment or post to look like I'm working. 

We both talk about some days where there is literally nothing to do so we are both on youtube all day, also I can't even start my work until the accounts department reconciles the accounts which they don't do till mid day, once they didn't bother doing it till 6pm, so I feel like looking like I'm working is better then sitting here clearing watching youtube.  


When we are the only two people in the office he leaves 15min early, he always made me leave with him because in the beginning I wasn't allowed to be in the office on my own, now he says ""we never take our 1hour break so leaving 15min early to miss the traffic is fair"", and I agreed. ; )"

Even if she *was* just trying to do something nice they should have understood that a close family member had just passed away and you might not want to take a photo to remember the moment.

Start the way you mean to finish and put your foot down, your life choices do not concern her, they are not decided by her, and you will not model your life around her.   


Pack up, move out, and tell her about your baby once your settled.

It does not mean that he is not over her, just that seeing her has a physiological stress response which is normal given how long he was in an abusive relationship with her.  


I'v be with my DH for almost a decade and we have been married for just over two months but if I saw the person I was in an abusive relationship with I recon I would have a very similar reaction, or go the opposite and cling to my DH and be overly affectionate with him in what people might think is a ""trying to make the other person jealous"" kind of way, but it wouldn't be anything but a fear/ panic response.

It not like she just hates you as a person to your core, its at the end of the day an issue that can be solved with some compromise.   
I wouldn't like it if someone told me how to dress but I also dress more conservatively around my and DH's grandparents out of respect.

You might want to look at why other people’s opinions on their own life which does not concern you offends you so much. 
Not everything is a judgment about your personal life choices.

JUSTNOMIL,fdj5dqa,t3_eja80u,1578458912.0,"First of all, gross, he seriously slept with her in her room, id be pointing our how incestuous that is and if he wants to sleep with mommy then he needs to take a long hard look at himself.   


Secondly he needs to learn that you are his family now, parents, siblings, aunts, uncles and everyone else is extended from the second you sign your marriage licence/ certificate and if he does not/ is incapable of putting the stability of your marriage first it will crumble and he will deserve it because his inability to detach himself from the talon like grip of his controlling and overbearing mother shows a level of immaturity that he will never grow out of.  


Tell him ""its time to stand up for your marriage, being you and him, or let you know that he considers you and your marriage to not be a priority so you can prepare for him to let his mother destroy it""   
I would also give him a warning, like if he is going to allow his mother to destroy your marriage he should tell you now instead of letting it drag on and if that's the case he should start packing.

&#x200B;

I'm not advocating divorce here but sometimes people need something to run away from as well as something to run too, and telling him the very real consequences of his actions and how they are affecting your marriage is a good kick up the ass and will show him just how serious the situation is."

It was held at a reception centre, there was from memory 3 courses of food and snacks (it was terrible food but not the point) they had this big ceremony to cut the cake.

She does not like that you are challenging her perceived dominance.   


Your definitely not the asshole here.  
Your email was well worded, you didn't make any demands and you clearly and calmly stated your position in no uncertain terms.

FIL getting out of hospital was an exception given the circumstances. 

I'm also taking the higher ground to an extent, being the reasonable one which in turn shows DH how much of a crazy person his mother is. 

DH is low contact because they are still his parents and he does not want to cut them out, but still wants to have boundaries which he feels the fact that we moved an hour away gives him."

It completely ruined the day, it came and went like just another day and now I feel no different.   
Didn't have a honeymoon either which didn't help, wedding then back at work the following Wednesday.

It might as well have not happened, I would have been much happier to have just signed the papers, just DH and I then gone out for a quiet romantic dinner, just the two of us.

I wouldn't suggest it honestly, the name I picked never felt right, every time I heard it it was like someone trying to get someone else's attention, but iv had that name for a third of my life now and now that iv gone back to my original name that doesn't feel right anymore either.  


I'm stuck somewhere in between the two, with no name that actually feels like mine.  
The closest thing I have to a name that actually feel like me is the pet name my DH calls me."

She was his childhood sweetheart, they had been married 70 years, and my aunts picked his house clean of all her things right in front of him.
