Futurology,ff2qyc8,t1_fco4fim,1579520086.0,"> You must think the French are the dumbest people on the planet.

No, when the French built their reactors solar power and wind was not viable options. Solar panels where insanely expensive.

France did not have coal and depended on imported fossil fuels. To achieve energy independence in the 70s, nuclear power was the only option."
Futurology,ff2qu4r,t1_fco989q,1579519917.0,"You cannot have it both ways. Nuclear advocates rely on new reactors and price reductions which have never materialized. We know prices keep going up and there are frequent delays.

If all energy in the world was provided by nuclear power our current known deposits of uranium would only last for TWO YEARS! If we only tried to cover electricity generation then it would cover a few more years.

Bottom line is that Nuclear advocates rely on a lot of assumption which have not been proven in the real world.

Yes we don't have a lot of cheap utility scale storage. I freely admit that. However my claim will be that achieving this is far easier than achieving the many assumptions of nuclear advocates.

We can buy plent of time to achieve this by using the combination of wind, solar, biomass, pumped hydro and gas power plants. These are already proven utility scale solutions."
Futurology,ff2qlq3,t1_fcoqw70,1579519577.0,"> I wish ""zero fatalities"" were the worst case scenario when solar rooftops caught fire or wind turbines collapsed.

Except those accidents don't cost 180 billion dollars to fix. Just a tiny little minor difference there. 

Nuclear fans love to focus on fatalities because they know it is very hard to claim fatalities for nuclear accidents which often have long term health damages which are hard to assess.

Also it avoid focus on the astronomical cost of cleaning up those accidents.

> a criminally negligent government and operator tries to fix the situation by dumping sea water into the reactors

Ah the goto excuse for nuclear apologists. Human error! Guess what that has to be taken into account when picking a solution. You cannot avoid human error. It is bound to happen. That has to feature into your plan.

If your power-plant is not safe from stupid human mistakes, then it is not a safe plant. Especially when they screw up in a well run country like Japan what do you think they will do in the rest of the world?

If we are to replace all power stations in the world with nuclear power plants they will exist in so many countries with bad government and bad work practices that a Chernobyl style accident will go off every week."
Futurology,ff2q9r5,t1_fcosn60,1579519087.0,"> Considering the mining will have to be done initially with fossils fuels, I think that pretty relevant. 

You got to start somewhere in an economy entirely built around fossil fuels it is impossible to start the transition to a non fossil fuel economy without spending fossil fuels to get there. It is a shitty argument against not making that change. What matters is what is possible long term. Long term we don't need to use fossil fuels for mining.

> Not to mention the environmental impact of mining for solar and wind collectors at those scales is mind boggling.

That impact is minuscule compare to the mining and extraction related to fossil fuels. The tons of coal need to make say a windmill gives significantly less power than that windmill does in a year, when burned in a coal plant. Going for wind and solar REDUCES need for mining. It does not increase it.

> Not true the price-Anderson act requires nuclear utilities to buy private insurance and pay into a collective industry fund. Those are priced into nuclear costs.

That does not cover accidents of all scales. Based on what I've read this seems to be geared more towards more common and smaller accident. It does not cover stuff of Fukushima scale at all.

> That’s your opinion. Irregardless the nuclear utilities are responsible for paying into decommissioning fund for their respective plants.

Because there is a history of underestimating it. Of course they will. Don't be naive. It is why projects are gross underestimated in cost to when bidding happens. It is an easy way to sell in your project.

> For the US and UK maybe, for other like countries like South Korea which has demonstrated policy commitment and commitment and allowance to gain experience have shown nuclear plants can be built on-time and on-budget.

How about we stay in the real world. That every country operates as well as South Korea is a fantasy. You have to relate to how the world actually is and not how you wish it to be.

> The US/UK can easily adopt their model to achieve cheap nuclear.

Funny how this is easy, but when you suggest America adopts health care policies / model from another country we are told that is impossible because America is so different. So how come those ""arguments"" don't apply in this case:

1. America is diverse but South Korea is homogenous. Much easier to get nice nuclear policies in a homogenous country where everybody pulls in the same direction.

2. South Korea is so tiny. Easy for them to do. Impossible in America because it is so big. Do you have any idea how big America is?!

3. America is a totally different country. You cannot compare. It is impossible to copy a model from another country. Traditions, culture everything is too different. You cannot assume something working in South Korea will work in the US."
Futurology,ff2pm8k,t1_fcqvddf,1579518117.0,"Then you are a dumbass. You don't have expensive waste management with renewables. Build times tend to be quite predictable and short. Decommissioning is relatively straightforward and cheap.

Renewables may have subsidies but those are quite transparent. You know how much a solar panel costs and how much it is being subsidized.  With nuclear power in contrast you can easily HIDE the subsidies by requiring far too low insurance premiums to insure against accidents, or only cover some accidents. The rest government has to cover. You can also easily HIDE costs by giving artificially low decommissioning costs or simply not mention them at all.

There is a great lack of long term storage for nuclear waste and since they have yet to be built, the price tag is anybody's guess.

There is simply far more ways to HIDE the true cost of nuclear power than there are ways to hide the cost of wind and solar."
Documentaries,ff2pakr,t1_ff2np0m,1579517625.0,"Very interesting story about the phone attachment! Thanks for sharing. I guess my reaction to the western thing is down to the fact that I cannot easily pick up on the style of asian tourists, but I can tell almost right away that somebody is American by their clothing style.

To me American and European clothing styles are quite different, and then there is a further divide between north, south, east and west in Europe.

I seem to also be kind of able to guess if somebody is from California or the midwest."

But yeah it is a difference in how you use another culture. If people dressed up in national outfits from my country to make stupid gags then I would be offended as hell. But if you are doing it because you are embracing my culture, then I don't have an issue."
Documentaries,ff2nn0e,t1_fezk462,1579515086.0,"No, only Americans. That whole cultural appropriation thing is a bunch of American BS! Sadly American hysteria has a tendency to travel to Europe eventually.

But you find white people who are dicks about it too. In my native Norway we have traditional clothes we wear for weddings and constitution day. Some right wing assholes complain when foreigners use our outfits. Especially if they don't look white.

Personally I think it is great. If they want to be Norwegian and embrace our culture, then that is great. I have no issues."
Documentaries,ff2n8gs,t1_ff0grmu,1579514456.0,"When I visit Hawaii it is easy to see the difference between locals and visiting Japanese tourists despite a lot of the locals having Japanese heritage.

Americans tend to dress a lot more casual, and Americans are more into looking ""badass"" or tough, while Japanese style seems to be more fashionable and geared more towards cute than tough.

As a European I would say their style is perhaps more like continental European. They don't use baseball caps as frequently as Americans. The women would often use these special Japanese style hats with wide brims in the front."

I love them very much and I know they care a lot about their father. When I am on way on travel my youngest will often struggle with sleeping. He really misses me. It makes you realize how devastating it would be for them if I was gone.

I went as far as starting to write an explanation to my kids of why I offed myself in case I ever had such a bad period that I did it without thinking through. Whatever happens in the future I want them to not be left with lots of unanswered questions and wonders if they were in any way the fault of it.

It is a sad state when the only thing a society has to offer people who struggle, is the prospect of harsh punishment should you fail to commit suicide.

It is also rather pointless. I doubt people ready to kill themselves are deterred by the threat: ""If you fail to kill yourself you will get life in prison."""

science,fbzauff,t1_fagp0ov,1577240571.0,"I suspect it is related to dopamine levels. Too low level and you just don't feel that much. As a child I felt more but I think children naturally get more dopamine released for various experiences. All their emotions are quite amplified.

I suspect there is a genetic component there. My mother and her father were quite calm people like me. My mother describes similar emotions as me, such as often not getting strong emotions.

It contrasts very much with my father who is quite emotional. It made it hard for me to relate to him. I don't think he ever really understood that I simply did not feel what he felt.

He seemed to think I was bottling up emotions, choosing not to show them, suppressing them or something. But I really wasn't. I just did not feel it.

I don't think I will ever be as emotional as my father but I suspect that if I was taking some sort of drug adjusting my dopamine levels I could feel more normal emotions. It is not like I feel the emotions are totally gone. More like they are just really weak.

The last few years it has been much worse due to my youngest son almost dying in an accident. I was under the belief that he was in fact dead for several minutes. It was a nightmarish experience.

He is fine and totally recovered today. He has no recollection of the event, he was too young then. But I feel I am somewhat permanently screwed up in the head because of it. Honestly I have been off for so many years I have basically forgotten what normal feels like, or what I am supposed to be like.

Only positive thing coming out of it I think is that at an intellectual level I understand better why many people struggle and life isn't easy. It makes you less judgmental knowing a lot of people have struggles that are invisible to yourself.

It makes you realize humans need humans. And probably understand better how to respond to people who are going through a rough time.  I think being a listener is better than offering lots of solutions. I think we humans, especially guys have an eagerness to suggest solutions, but it easily just gets annoying to the person hearing it. Especially if you have had mental problems for years. People will just offer advice you have heard countless times before or even tried.

I don't mind much hearing other people describe their problems and how they managed to get through them. But especially hearing well meaning advice from people who never actually had a mental health problem is usually just frustrating. Most of the time, they really just have no clue what it is like."
