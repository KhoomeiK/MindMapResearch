I kinda disagree with you in the case of Epstein. He had dirt on so many people that if he released 1 or 2 names, then everybody he *doesn't* name has a great opportunity to murder him and pin it on those who have been named. Granted, he could name everybody likely to be able to get away with having him murdered (so Trump/Barr/etc would be at the top of the list), but that's not perfect-- a lot of people have a good amount of pull when they need it.

savageworlds,feeqevw,t3_eolp81,1579039015.0,"So I don't know the setting, but here's some brainstorming: 

1. Do the players have their own ship? Most likely, capturing a pirate ship will cause some damage to it, burn through some ammo or other supplies that needs to be replenished/etc. The cost of these repairs offsets the income from the prize. If they *don't* have their own ship, it's quite likely that they won't want to sell the ship... but rather they'll want to *keep* the ship, which sounds like a pretty awesome backstory to how they came to have one to me. 
2. The ship they take will also likely take damage in the fighting... or if not, it's run by pirates, so it is likely already not in the best shape, making it worth a lot less. Still valuable, but not brand new ship valuable. 
3. They aren't the legal owners of the ship. There's a few ways you can handle this, in my mind: 

Firstly, you can just have it be another hit against how much they get. They find a fence, and he tells them that he can buy it, but it'll be tough for him to unload without the proper papers. 

Second option, they can bring it in to a government as a prize, for which they get a commission... and maybe the magistrate they get is corrupt and clearly undervalues the ship, so instead of 20% of say, 10k, they get 20% of 8k (adjust numbers based on party size and on how much they potentially need to spend on repairs on their own ship). Still a good payout for a new party, but if you make it obvious they're being cheated a bit, you can even set up a new recurring villain! 

Or another way to set up a great plot tie in: the pirates are a part of a gang run by one of the most ruthless and powerful mob bosses in the area. Few buyers are willing to touch it, and those that are will only do so at a discount-- and the more they try to shop around for a better buyer, the more likely it is that word about the mob boss's property's location gets back to him."

It's only Republicans arguing that Iran was involved in 9/11... because you know, it totally makes sense for a *Shia* country to ally with Al Qaeda, a Sunni extremist organization that murders Shiites.
