I was hoping they'd do that - the first collection centres around Geralt recovering from the striga fight and relating/remembering various encounters. 

However... Yennefer only appears in the last story and Ciri not at all, and while I'm very happy with that as I like neither character, the showrunner (despite her ""faithful to the books"" promise) couldn't have that. So instead we have a made up backstory for Yennefer that makes her even nastier than she comes across in the book, and more Ciri (who only appears in the last short story of the second collection).

That said, aside from more Yennefer than I ever want to see (literally and figuratively) I had more of an issue with the bad script, average acting and cheap looking production than anything else."
