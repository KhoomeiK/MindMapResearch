So, if I get caught with a ton of weed, I should be slapped with a misdemeanor?

>For personal use within what time frame?

Different jurisdictions actually have different laws for dealing with this. So, for example, my country has a policy which states that if you get busted with up to 2g of weed outside, it's considered to be for personal use, bc you could've went to a party or whatever. Now, the amount of weed at your home is a bit more tricky. So, theoretically, if they search your home and find 3g but with scales, grinders, plastic bags, etc. you could get busted for drug dealing, but usually with a parole.  I'm not intimate with Florida drug laws, and internet search turns out only laws for medical marijuana and such.

I agree with you that drug laws are way too inconsistent and often depend on cops and judiciary discretion, so two people who had the same amount could get vastly different outcomes. That doesn't mean, however, that drug dealing is fine or that there shouldn't be  *some* limit where we can say ''OK, this person has definitely bought that amount in order to sell it''."

chess,fdruf52,t3_emu08t,1578689897.0,"So, there are basically two schools of thoughts, so to speak, about chess. First one states that chess is this majestic, beautiful game which speaks deeply about life, love and war. It's a supreme battle of wits and intellect, and so far and so forth.

Second school states that there's basically nothing special about chess and that it's a game like any other. I align myself firmly with this line of thinking, because it's a game with a set of rules and the best player to manipulate those rules wins. It can't be an analogy for war or life because there's no reason why a king couldn't negotiate the exchange of hostages, and there's no reason that friendly fire is impossible, or why the king couldn't get captured but get away, you get my point. Games like Hearts of Iron or Crusader Kings are a far better analogy for war anyways.

Now, that doesn't mean that I don't like chess. I really, really do. I also love football. I love playing it, I love watching it. And recently there was a situation where my personal life could suffer if I continued watching it relentlessly. So I skipped a game.  The crisis was averted, and I continued watching football just next week without problem.

Second problem I wanted to deal with is this misconception that chess is not a sport. I also used to think that way until I've read about it and actually started playing myself. It can be incredibly stressful and draining, especially during tournaments where you can't play whenever you want. Double that for fast chess.  Were you ever bone-tired after a day of sitting at the office? If you have, you know that it's a bit different type of exhaustion than an hour at the gym, but it's tiring nonetheless. 

It's for this reason that many top chess players are, on top of practicing chess, also improving their fitness when preparing for tournaments. Iron Tigran used to ski. Carouana is lifting weights. There are many examples, you get my point.

My advice: step back, let it cool off for a bit. Reevalue whether you're able to overcome this depressed feeling, and if not, whether chess is worth it. If you do decide to continue, I'd suggest picking up a beginners book immediately and spending more time practicing than playing. I'm planning on dedicating myself to the theory in the following days because I've hit my ceiling about a month ago and I've even started regressing.

ShitPoliticsSays,fdquml3,t1_fdqssmw,1578675153.0,">  but that would put you at odds with the people who know the science.

Any scientist who would have quipped in that abortions are or aren't heinous would be a hack, pure and simple. The reason is that whether something is heinous is **not** a scientific question, but a philosophical one. Science can tell you what an abortion does and how does it look like. Science can tell you, with reasonable reliability, what are the long term effects of banning or allowing abortions. It can tell you the impacts on the mother's health, or the impact on the economy.

 It can't tell you whether abortion is morally right or not, because you can't measure morality.  There were a couple of experiments during the 19th century where scientific principle was applied to the social philosophy. It ended in millions of deaths. Whether anything is moral or not is up to the public to decide. 

And that's assuming that all scientists agree with each other, and that science is set in stone, which is often not the case.

>banning abortion would be positive action by the government

So? I'm fine with positive action by the government as long as it's to protect fundamental rights, one of them being right to life. They also prohibit murder and theft. 

>So far they've just refused to get involved. So not quite a technocratic hell hole.

That's not true, the least democratic branch of the government legalized it everywhere.  Overturning *Roe* would simply leave that decision to the individual states."

Which is fair, but imagine this scenario: JCOS make an announcement that the best  tactic to root out insurgents from a town is to turn the entire place into a parking lot by bombing them to kingdom come. Now, the voters presumably don't want their military to commit war crimes. 

SCOTUS then proclaims that committing war crimes is a constitutional right of the military and that no legislation can be made to prevent that.
