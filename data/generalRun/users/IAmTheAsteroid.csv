science,ff9ocis,t1_ff9i5rr,1579717204.0,"Oftentimes, your immune system is lowered for a brief period after getting a vaccine. This is because it's busy learning to fight the vaccine, which is exactly how vaccines work. This is why a lot of people feel sort of ""under the weather"" after getting it. It doesn't mean they're actually sick. 

Other people may catch a cold or something while they're immune system is weakened immediately after the flu vaccine. Then they associate the two and assume the vaccine made them sick, when really they just caught something else.

And a very few people may have already had the flu when they got vaccinated and were in the pre-symptom stage."

Edit: You can buy them pretty easily, I just have a weirdly shaped toilet that I can't even find a regular replacement seat/lid for."

It's really hard balancing family time, alone downtime, and hobbies time while working full time. But I also like my job so I don't want to quit."

Measuring by weight is clearly the superior method, though."

He was told to put on his hat, and he tried to grab his wife's head. He also didn't know what a glove or a rose was. Plenty more examples, but those are the ones I remember."
AskReddit,fcx0ymj,t1_fcwzebw,1578046325.0,The Brain That Changes Itself has a lot more hard science though. Might be harder to follow for someone without at least a bit of background on the topic. But it is very interesting.

My mother in law also has a VERY affectionate boy and an aloof girl. All of our cats are strictly indoor only."

AskReddit,fc2enc0,t1_fc2859n,1577355804.0,">Also parents out there, don't fight in front of your kids. Please.

But DO disagree and discuss it in a healthy way (if an appropriate topic) in front of them.

I grew up literally never hearing my parents have a disagreement. It took years for me to learn that disagreeing or even having a healthy argument with your partner is NOT a sign of a problem in the relationship.

Additionally, I didn't learn how to argue in a healthy way, because there was nothing for me to model it on. If an argument started, it was all in and MEAN. Thankfully I grew a lot when I started dating my husband."
AmItheAsshole,fc06m9a,t1_fbzpbxi,1577280835.0,I think at that point OP should have just told his family why he dumped Sarah. But do it *in front of her*.
