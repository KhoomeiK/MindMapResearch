cats,ff2jdnu,t3_er3s9y,1579508786.0,"Most sincere condolences.  Lost my tuxedo several years ago.  He also had the chin mark but a bit less centered, the mask a bit more extensive.  He was with us 17 1/2 years and we also had to make that decision.  He was no longer eating or drinking, and all we could do was snuggle him and tell him goodbye, then drive him to the vet.  Cancer.  We will always miss him but the memories no longer make us cry as often.  Sends safe internet hugs."

cats,feowfta,t3_eq2zrv,1579306871.0,"Very handsome kitty.  Wants to pet!  Had roomies in college. One cared for her kitty. Other two were morons who did things like adopt under age kittens and put them on diets! Let them crap everywhere etc...they were illegal pets. Only reason I didn't have the RA remove them was for caring for them more than roomies did.  At end of semester I walked out and they (They'd actually tried to have residence halls schedule ME to clean up!  They never had, used my dishes, you name it.  Common areas total pigsty and I was the only one to clean! Finally had stopped). MY room was spotless but they were beyond disgusting.  Anyway.  I walked out, and RA and all made them stay and clean.  Spoiled horrors were so angry.  So served em right.  Other roomy cared for her kitty another year.  I named her.  Snickers.  Tortie...looked the colors of the inside of a snickers.  She was beloved and moved out with her.  Got kitties a few months out of Uni."
