I'm not sure how adhd meds impact babies - my instincts say I would not want to be on them. But if you're stressed out because you can't function well that's also not good for the baby.

I think we're sort of trained as women not to be angry/ express anger even when we should be angry sometimes. I dunno just a thought.

You might try describing something that ""someone"" (or make up a name) did / does - something one of your ""friends"" is dealing with... Do this with something that Jay has done ... and see how your boyfriend reacts and then point out that Jay did the thing. See how he reacts. 

He might need to be shaken out of his blind loyalty to his friend. 

You might point out to him also that... saying someone did something bad isn't the same as calling them a bad person- it's okay to criticize your friends and still love them/ think well of them. 

No idea what's going on with the loyalty thing. Have you talked about this stuff with the other roommate/ friend? does he think the same? maybe you could confront your boyfriend together about how some of Jay's behavior is not normal/ okay.

It does to me sound like your husband has ADHD but it also sounds to me like he could do better- it's really hard to judge anyone else's struggles with ADHD because its such a different experience for all of us- he may just need tools & therapy / it may take time.

I say this from a kind place- but it's pretty normal not to find extra skin attractive- I don't know that it's a realistic goal- to want him to find those parts of you attractive. I could see myself not being bothered by extra skin on someone I really loved and still finding them very attractive but I don't think I would ever find the extra skin itself attractive.

This does not decrease your worth at all! You sound lovely & wonderful- you absolutely deserve to feel good about your body- but it might be more realistic for him to simply work on feeling neutral about those parts & be attracted to you as a person.

relationships,fggzea5,t1_fggz9lv,1580773034.0,I actually think it sounds like a good idea for you to keep your kids away from them & wouldn't blame you for that at all / would really support that decision.
relationships,fggz9lv,t3_eyfjsb,1580772946.0,"Wow, I was ready to be like ""no you shouldn't forgiveness they're kids"" but uh... wow... you've had to deal with a lot. 

It's not really their fault they're so horrible... their mom should have taught them better... but... you are not required to deal with it."
relationships,fggygvs,t1_fggxlyd,1580772411.0,"well I don't think you need to worry about telling people about HPV - cause like everyone has that & it can be cleared from your system anyway.

I actually have an ex with herpes too & I honestly don't know if I have it- that's what I tell people.

Some people think you don't need to talk to partners about having herpes because of how common herpes is & that people should know it's always a risk- but I can't do that myself- I would feel bad if I found out I had it and gave it to someone."
relationships,fggxnqm,t1_fggwfgw,1580771878.0,perhaps he could get a heated blanket to stay warm? & relax similarly just not in the bath?
relationships,fggxabi,t3_eyeah5,1580771633.0,"O by the way- they don't typically test for herpes unless you specifically ask them to- so you should make sure that you were actually tested for it before. 

:P false negatives are also common."
relationships,fggwsh0,t3_eyeah5,1580771309.0,"Like everyone has HPV don't worry about that. It's extremely common - I don't even think there's a way to test guys for it- or there probably is but they don't... (girls get a Pap smear and that's how they find out they have it) 

Herpes is also not really a big deal most of the time- and testing for it is frankly unreliable - your ex could have had a false positive. Do a little research about this- if she had a sore that tested positive that's definitely a positive- but if she had a blood test those have a pretty high false positive rate- one type of blood test is so unreliable the CDC says not to use it for diagnosis. 

... once upon a time I would have been very concerned about this but I'm more educated now so I wouldn't be so concerned."

In the future I would just leave the stuff wet on top of the washer or drier if it's not moved quickly.

relationships,fggoj79,t3_eyc0dk,1580766151.0,"No you need to be able to talk with your friends about things. It can be hard to realize how bad your partner's behavior is without other's perspectives & it can also be hard to realize if you are in the wrong sometimes. 

I think you shouldn't ""talk shit"" but having thoughtful conversations about problems is fine. 

Working things out by yourself doesn't always work very well- I think.. this kind of thinking keeps people in unhealthy marriages / relationships for a long time because they can't see how bad things are/ have gotten."
women,fggnno8,t3_eye3bm,1580765629.0,"Hmmm I wonder if you could find an understanding doctor who would write you sort of a standing prescription/ refillable prescription or a prescription when you call about it. 

I used to be very prone to sinus infections and I would just call my doctor and they would write me a prescription for antibiotics. 

It's not the same thing but I think you can get refills on antiviral medications for herpes - if this is a chronic issue for you it makes sense to me that your doctor might write you a refillable prescription

Good luck! that sounds really frustrating!"

Answering 2 text messages doesn't warrant this reaction especially given the boyfriend also took texts & calls- you are assuming a lot that his messages were more important than hers. Even if they were its still hypocritical of him to demand that she say off her phone.  

She doesn't have to be obedient to him. Your phrasing is fucked up. ""you disrespected his wishes"" are you kidding me?"

If you stay you'll probably end up resentful of her or yourself / your choice or both. Break up man."
relationships,fgg99nh,t3_ey4hvp,1580756998.0,"you don't sound terribly compatible - everyone is different there isn't really a normal - you may need to find someone who likes alone time as much as you.

A thought for you - Does your girlfriend have very many close friends around? / other people to be social with? she might do better with your alone time needs if she had more people to be social with.

You might also consider an open relationship/ polyamory - so that her needs for more company might be met while your needs for alone time were also met.

Somebody down below commented that you may like but not love her- quite possible & since this is ""a constant push & pull"" with you.. You two should have a serious conversation about how you might rectify this - maybe the answer is her having more friends/ company or polyamory. Or Maybe you two just aren't compatible

good luck!"

relationships,fgcf1hn,t1_fgaa9zf,1580672007.0,I think I agree with this- as woman who's been in similar situations where a guy is attracted to me but I'm not attracted to him - the attention & affection can still feel really nice. I just never feel like kissing them.

If he's ever open to talking about things maybe you could just talk about what you're comfortable with and what you're not comfortable with & go from there. 

I definitely think you should make more friends though and hang out with more folks. Are there any clubs or organizations for international kids? Or any other clubs you're interested in?  Is there a swing dancing club? (swing dancing is amazing) 

It might be best to try to find a different living situation as soon as possible."
relationships,fgc9wo7,t3_exdxcb,1580670673.0,"you might be heteroflexible or bisexual but also... you might be straight and just enjoy the affection/ attention. It's very human to want physical contact. 

I'm a woman & I've been... playfully physical with some guys that I wasn't really attracted to but whom were attracted to me &... It feels good to feel that someone is very attracted to you. It feels nice to snuggle & be affectionate. 

So you might be straight is my point - or you might occasionally be attracted to men or you might be bi- it doesn't really matter all of these things are fine & nothing to feel bad about \*hugs\*

It kind of sounds like you're straight to me & just enjoying the physical contact /affection. I say this because you haven't said anything about having a desire to kiss him & it sounds like he's mostly touching you."

It's ridiculous that she's being shamed for this though- I can't imagine a mormon woman getting shamed in the same way if she wore something above the knee for instance- or rather if her knees were accidentally visible in a picture. Would she? I honestly don't know? If so I would also object to that- but haven't heard about a story like that.
