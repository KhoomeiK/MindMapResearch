college,fdpq3wa,t1_fdn9ayl,1578636267.0,"There's a campus legend in my uni, a professor is being pressured by students into preparing a multiple-choice test, for final of a very theoretical class in an engineering department. The topic being very hard, with a relentless professor, students assumed the test will be better for them. 

Yet, there are two students in that class, whom are about to fail that class almost surely. They said to each other ""Dude, forget passing this class. Let's go drinking."" They leave class after that, also not entering the final. They planned to retake the class next semester, or next year.

Prof agrees to give a multiple choice test. Yet, prof states that every wrong answer will decrease overall points by a fraction of a question. Also, for the malicious compliance, prof made the test so, so hard. Everybody lost a lot of points, got negative results. Prof announced that the results are devastating, with only two students having zero points, the highest grades of the final. Guess who got zero? Yeah, that two students who went drinking and not entering the final. They also passed the class, although just barely, yet it was okay for them. So... they practically did nothing :)"
college,fdmq5xh,t1_fdmnw5d,1578560312.0,"Having anxiety and feeling depressed is everyday events for people nowadays. But, many people suffer from anxiety disorder, and chronic depression. There is a difference. It will be a very basic analogy, but it's like feeling cold and having pneumonia. Is it okay to cough uncontrollably just because everybody coughs but still lives? It isn't, right. That's similar. It's not okay to feel uncontrollably anxious and losing your functionality due to anxiety, just because everybody feels anxious every now and then. It's not okay to feel dreadfully bad every day and night, losing sleep and appetite, just because everybody feels under the weather a day or two. These are disorders, medical problems. Screw your insensitive supervisors, professors and whatnot, and go heal your mind and soul. You need it."
ProRevenge,fdmp25u,t1_fdk70et,1578558824.0,"Yeah, most of us don't know if it is beyond your work definition, thus, related to you going out of your way to make it happen, I said ""No, I guess?"" It's vague without details, but nobody expects you to share deep details also. 

All facts and details aside, kudos to you. :)"
ProRevenge,fdmoti8,t1_fdm5gcl,1578558501.0,"Well, considering my personal experience of cramming 6 months' work into one, it can be done with ultimate grind I guess. Yes, a multiplier of 8 is there, but, still. :)"
ProRevenge,fdk3x7d,t3_elrclv,1578495452.0,"Satisfying to read? Yes. 

Did you go out of your job description? No, I guess? 

Did you comply to a definitely silly request, knowing that it will have consequences for the request owner? Yes, visibly so.

That's why people are saying that the story fits to r/maliciouscompliance better, instead of here.

But, again, great story OP. 10/10 would love to listen to those calls. I'm sure rSlash, a YouTube channel who covers such stories, would, too. :D"
college,fctm1um,t3_eit4ip,1577948396.0,"Not a direct answer to your question, as u/AceyAceyAcey did explain it like a boss, but it helped me to skim the topic before the class and trying to find and solve related questions after the lecture helped me a lot. It's not easy to stay on top of this ""before and after"" game, but as I managed to do pre-class skimming and post-class question solving, I got good results. Definitely working for me and many friends in engineering field."
aww,fcqfdwi,t1_fcqeidw,1577884959.0,Nice. Hope she's healthy. She looks very calm and even playful. :)
