spirituality,ff86pvt,t1_ff85gjh,1579667547.0,"So you'll just go on to a different drug?? 
It sounds like you need a new teacher, to go deeper into yourself and search for what's true and what spirituality really is to you? Not what someone has told you, what you read in a book or what is ""popular"". Many spiritual teaching overemphasize separating yourself out from your thoughts or even silencing them completly. But I think the search for truth and the truth inside your self, and who you really are, both on a human level, and on a spiritual level are much more important. 
You're quitting something is probably causing your depression. If you're going to get on pharmaceuticals, I think it would be far wiser to go back to Kratom. Limit your dosage. It's a safe, natural plant! Vs a synthetic drug. Made in a lab, which nature had no intention of you finding or of it even existing. And there is No Plan for you to get off a drug once a doc puts you on one, they don't want you to stop taking it, it's more money for them. They're terrible terrible things. I'll leave you now though. It seems youre lost and it seems you're going in a direction I can't imagine going back in. So, it's your journey, I wish you luck."

Go to the supplement section of a health food store and ask someone to help you, (most health food stores have a person who just works in the supplements section, also there's tons of information online about it). Also I take Kratom for mood and anxiety and general existential pain. It is amazing. Marijuana works well for many. You could try a regimen of microdosing psilocybin mushrooms every so often. (There are guides online on how to treat depression and anxiety with them). There are many options to explore I would not go the artificial legal drug dealer route... 😊💙 I wish you the best of luck.

offmychest,ff82io7,t3_es5sm6,1579664281.0,"Love is the most needed, sought after, missing, and misunderstood thing in this world. Love is simply love, it can be there in so many ways, it can even be easily missed. Most think that love is ""infatuation"" or ""obsession"" but really those are generally superficial on one level or another. Keep looking, and make sure you don't miss it when you find it. I'm married to a women who for almost 10 years I thought I only wanted to be friends with (best friends forever, we said) because she didn't have any of the ""qualifying qualities in high enough quantities"" as I like it put it (the term I describe most people's process of finding a relationship partner with) but it she knew there was something more there. I tried to tell her she was just infatuated, because I had a lot of her ""qualifying qualities in high quantities"". But I have come to realize, NO FUCKING ONE, I could have found, would love me the way she does. I would have been miserable with the ""hottest, smartest, youngest looking, most funny and intelligent and successful"" women I could have found, because I know (now) she would have been missing the important qualities (to me anyway) understanding, open-mindedness, forgiveness, sweetness, kindness, black-sheep-ness, fun, crazy in the best ways, doesn't buy into the world's bull shit, but isn't so cynical, or ""realistic"" or negative as I am. We fit each other like puzzle pieces, which means a lot of my strengths are her weaknesses, and vise versa... And I think that's what everyone needs, a puzzle piece, that's someone you'll want to actually spend the rest of your life with and not get (that) bored. Good luck my friend ❤️"

I'm so sorry. The world we live in is so much darker and more cruel than most people even realize. If really can be like living in a nightmare for so many. I wish you luck. I hope you can find relief from your pain.
Also if you're not going to kill yourself right away (I hope you don't). Maybe you should try Kratom. Is like weed but it's a plant you ingest, among many things it effects the opioid receptors and has really helped a lot of people find relief from the pains of life. You should take some and see how you feel. It can be purchased online or in smoke shops on most states in the US. I take it throughout the day and it's a life saver... There's much more meaning and depth and good and beauty in the world than most see, most people just live fake lives and repress everything and pretend to be happy. Cruel and mean people run this world top to bottom. But the truth and meaning and love is there. Buried...
