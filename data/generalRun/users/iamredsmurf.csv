MMA,ffvb235,t3_ev09st,1580259915.0,Joe had the nerve to say masvidal assaulted leon edwards. Didnt he know jorge was scared?
apexlegends,fftioms,t1_ffti8qf,1580221579.0,It takes most heroes quite a while to close distance besides pathfinder who makes a loud metal grapple sound if hes trying to climb the building youre on. Im not saying spin around. I have a mental timer in my head when i start a gunfight because third partying is so prevalent in this game. Stand still and fight for an extended period and someone will come. If you place yourself correctly you dont have to worry as much.
apexlegends,ffti5th,t1_fftgye6,1580221185.0,"You can complain. Or you can adapt. I watch ""pros"" look around and check flanks."
apexlegends,fftghrd,t1_fftg4dy,1580219874.0,"Were you in a gunfight? Or explosions around? With my simple ass playstation headset i can hear who is walking (metal clinks pathfinder, octane has the added gear sounds or is even louder when he stims for example) and their general direction. Nothing you do in this game is silent but it can get harder to hear those little sounds in a gunfight. Thats just logic. Real soldiers get flanked all the time if they dont keep their head on a swivel as bangalore would say."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fftg32x,t1_fftflaa,1580219542.0,"I ask were you raised strict and you respond ""get that dumb ass bullshit out of here"" seems defensive. I could be wrong but you didnt bother to give your side. Just attacked as if i was attacking you just by asking. Thats the definition of defensive."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fftfxkf,t1_fftflaa,1580219415.0,Is that what i said or did i ask if theres a difference between carelessness and genuine accidents? Then to put perspective on the conversation asked were you raised strict. If you take that as me calling you damaged thats on you. I dont know you at all were just having a conversation.
apexlegends,fftfmhy,t1_fftdc0x,1580219161.0,"With a good headset they really arent. When i ask people they usually complain about being flanked mid gunfight with explosions and gunfire all around them. No the footsteps wont be louder than the spitfire youre shooting. Sometimes you have to look around.

Edit: crouch walking is even quieter. Ive used it to sneak up on people."

funny,ffteyae,t1_fft5oiz,1580218597.0,Google gallows humor and you'll get its a pretty natural response when things get serious but are mostly out of your control. Its that or panic and i prefer people laughing.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fftei56,t1_fftdr4v,1580218206.0,Super defensive im just asking questions man. Whatever. Take it however you want. Probably answered my question anyway.
