DestinyTheGame,ffg4jns,t1_ffg1dfa,1579898307.0,"Next time notice whether killing those adds causes more adds to spawn and get caught in your tether, refilling your super energy."

DestinyTheGame,fffuqcg,t1_fffkdm3,1579892217.0,"Also wrong, killing doesn’t extend. 

“Provides ability energy for each enemy tethered by Deadfall anchors.”

That’s all it does."
DestinyTheGame,fffuluk,t1_fffqbqu,1579892140.0,"It isn’t about extending duration. Orpheus Rig gives you super energy back for each enemy tethered. It doesn’t have anything to do with kills.

Sometimes killing enemies can cause more enemies to spawn, and those can give you super energy back when they’re tethered. Also, killing enemies grants super energy. So it might seem like kills grant more super energy while using Orpheus Rig, but that’s not what the exotic does."
DestinyTheGame,fffoeoq,t1_fffm7by,1579888307.0,"No, they just need to be tethered.

Edit: I am absolutely positive that super energy returns based on tethering and not kills. Orpheus Rig isn’t like the other exotics that return bonus super energy on kills. Try it out."
DestinyTheGame,fffodz1,t1_fffkcql,1579888295.0,It’s actually just tethering that gets you super energy back.
DestinyTheGame,fffniql,t3_esu87r,1579887772.0,Deeper.
DestinyTheGame,fffmo6n,t1_ffdkkh9,1579887255.0,"Look I’m an older player, I’m from the NES era, and I don’t raid or grind nightfalls anymore but I still play a lot. 

The game is in a better place than ever. People are so demanding, it’s unreal how much people want from a video game. It’s not enough that it exists real-time with way more moving parts onscreen than I could ever imagine, it has to constantly be pumping out new content for some very vocal people.

And yeah I miss Dead Orbit and new guns from the vendors. But they’re coming from a lot of other places now. People miss factions and Trials but gambit replaced both of those, and it has matchmaking and a pve only mode to go along with it! 

Am I going to get the two new exotics? Maybe! If not, so what! I have a hundred guns I never get to shoot and the new exotics will end up in the Xur pool eventually. Or they won’t. So what. 

The crucible has never been this diverse, leveling has never been easier (or as irrelevant which is PERFECT for hardcore casuals), and I’ve never switched up my weapon loadout this much because there are so many cool guns with personality to choose from. Some people won’t be happy until you play the game for them and make them a sandwich."
DestinyTheGame,fffjjsx,t1_ffdp2op,1579885331.0,"That sounds good, you have a chance of getting it early and if not, an ending in sight. They could do a lot more quests this way and I think people would like it. Especially the people who have run a raid 100 times without getting the ship or whatnot."

destiny2,ffdag6x,t1_ffbsswc,1579816629.0,Iron banner is more fun for me when underleveled because I only expect to die. Every kill is a big deal and I can still get some new gear. Also I follow a guy who can absorb  a bunch of shots and soften up the enemy.

Not all, but a lot of employees have been very cool and the position can attract real enthusiasts who seem to know their games."
