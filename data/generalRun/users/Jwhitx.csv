netflix,ffia6uf,t1_ffhupcl,1579969015.0,"I've seen the Road movie before when it came out, so that's why I read Blood Meridian first. I think that if you are 1/3 way thru BM, and if I am going to start The Road book soon...that we both have some crazy shit in our future. Blood Meridian was a visceral reaction right up until the end monologue, I expect no less from the road!"

netflix,ffhoprs,t1_ffhgl6c,1579945767.0,"I just got done reading Blood Meridian, also by McCarthy, also pretty brutal. If The Road is anything like that (I know there was quite some time in between...), I'm excited for it to reach the top of the reading list. I have no idea how someone could make prose out of a roving gang of nihilistic scalp hunters constantly at war with their surroundings, but he damn did it. Such a great writer."
netflix,ffhojwq,t1_ffhihqx,1579945513.0,"Yeah but you are in a thread where it's likely that people are just now discovering these movies, so the date they came out is irrelevant. If OP had not previously seen this movie, and they specifically made this thread to find new movies including it, spoiling it would be stupid. Enjoy the new find, here's a nice preview of major plot developments."
