gtaonline,fff110v,t1_ffevcpa,1579872719.0,People seem to like the Pariah. It has the best acceleration (I think) and is usually the car used in the time trial videos.
gtaonline,ffck0xe,t1_ffb7g2w,1579801105.0,I enjoy the actual mission for the vehicles so I stick to that unless it’s double money for crates.
