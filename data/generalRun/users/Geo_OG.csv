Hagelslag was first created in [1913](https://www.delpher.nl/nl/kranten/view?coll=ddd&identifier=MMDA03:000109713:mpeg21:a0073) due to it's inventor seeing a hailstorm in Amsterdam.

Maybe Western countries don't feel the need to take care of people that don't even take care of themselves. If China had any respectability, it wouldn't be used as the garbage dump of the world.

A little later, environmental scientists ruefully confirmed he was partially right. In hot weather, trees release volatile organic hydrocarbons including terpenes and isoprenes - two molecules linked to photochemical smog. In very hot weather, the production of these begins to accelerate. [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/may/13/thisweekssciencequestions3)

So basically trees do cause more pollution than cars - it's just that trees also suck up more carbon dioxide and do more good than harm which makes his statement misleading."
