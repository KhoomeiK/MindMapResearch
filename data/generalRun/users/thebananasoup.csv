succulents,ff8lw80,t1_ff5z5ho,1579684952.0,"I seldom water them, only water them thoroughly once every 2 to 3 weeks since they are so small and I can't tell from their leaves if they need water. I don't know how to check by looking at the soil. They're in an office, so it's pretty low humidity due to air conditioning.

They receive morning sun through tinted windows and I have grow lights that are on for roughly 5 to 6 hours a day in the afternoons on weekdays."

proplifting,ff5o94e,t3_erstic,1579602932.0,"As the title suggested actually, I have a couple of props that I realized the tips of the leaves are of lighter colour. See top and bottom left props. Bottom right prop seems to have the tips burnt off/dried off. I'm wondering if I'm giving them too much light to cause this? They're receiving shaded morning sunlight and artificial lights in the afternoon for a couple of hours. Please help, thanks!"

NintendoSwitch,feit0h5,t3_ep8pt0,1579146440.0,"If you want a funny game, other than the ones mentioned (Overcooked 2, The Stretchers), [Think of the Children](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/think-of-the-children-switch/) is pretty hilarious. You and your buddies have to complete several tasks and at the same time save kids from dying in ridiculous ways. It's not the most polished game, but when you have to yeet a kid across the lawn to prevent a beehive from dropping on his head, that's pretty amazing."
todayilearned,fegd1o2,t1_fegcqz0,1579088284.0,"I think it's essential to get the milk tea part right. Make the tea with condensed milk before you mix it in with coffee, I guess? Sorry, I've never made it, just ordered it."
todayilearned,fefxje3,t1_fefs13f,1579068511.0,"That's very true, I didn't even think about it that way until you mentioned! 

If you like milk tea and coffee separately, I think you'll like yuanyang. I'm not a coffee person but I love the combination."
todayilearned,fefxgco,t1_fefpkte,1579068424.0,"I think you're thinking of yin and yang, which symbolizes balance. 

Yuanyang means mandarin ducks, often found in pairs, with the female and male ducks looking really different. In this case, I guess it's how well both beverages complement each other despite the vast differences."

Comes in both hot and iced versions. I personally love the iced version!"
todayilearned,feffcpa,t1_fefdx10,1579055140.0,A half coffee half tea drink is actually quite popular in Southeast Asia and it tastes really nice and smooth. You should try it when you get the chance.

NintendoSwitchDeals,fdp6otc,t1_fdo3mmx,1578621266.0,"Yes for me. I didn't think of myself as someone who would enjoy farming in a game, but surprisingly I got hooked and keep wanting to better my farm and equipment. Then one day, for some reason I just dropped it, but the number of hours I've already put in made the price really worth it."

I think got it on the eshop back on 31 Dec for around USD 9."

[Automachef](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/automachef-switch/) is quite interesting, it's like a factory where you have to plan where to put machines to come out with the final dish.
