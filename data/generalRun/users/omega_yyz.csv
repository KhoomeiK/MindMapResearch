trashy,ff4x7cc,t1_ff4sdnz,1579574605.0,"Yaaaaaaaah, imagine living in a world where eating meat is the number one cause of cardiovascular disease, the number one cause of heart attacks and strokes and dementia, the number one cause of deforestation and loss of wildlife habitat and... oh wait... we don’t have to imagine.  at some point people aren’t going to have a choice to go vegan.  eating meat is for the uneducated and the selfish.  which one are you?  i agree that yelling at patrons of steakhouses isn’t going to change much but if it happens all the time outside of every steakhouse less and less people will go.  people should feel uncomfortable for participating in selfish, environmentally destructive and abusive practices.  those vegans might be annoying but they’re not wrong."
trashy,ff4vppu,t3_ergsvd,1579573581.0,"Someone told me that fur is the most energy-intensive textile in the world, the amount of energy required to produce it is higher than any other material - synthetic or not.  I guess raising an animal from birth, all the food and water it will consume and the toxic chemicals used to treat the fur to keep it from decomposing make it super environmentally unfriendly."
elonmusk,fec9u8e,t3_eodsv1,1578969231.0,"also Tesla now produces enough solar energy to fuel every single Tesla vehicle on the road.  so yes, while you as a private owner might charge your Model S with energy produced by fossil fuels, there are thousands of homes outfitted with Tesla solar roofs that are giving back to the grid to make up for it.  and let’s not forget that all superchargers are powered using green energy.  do people really use that as an argument?  until my town/city/state switches to renewables i won’t buy an electric vehicle?  lol  that’s silly yah?"
