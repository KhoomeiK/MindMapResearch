I have a family member who was in strong opposition to Obamacare. I pointed out that I thought it might be good because her mom might be able to get some insurance. Her answer? She didn’t like it because she heard that if you received Medi-Cal, they’d take your tax refund. Bitch does get a tax refund, did not pay taxes though. Her family was on Section 8, Medi-Cal and received some food stamps. When you receive that kind of assistance, you can claim exempt from withholding and still get a tax refund.

Wavyhair,ff3zrai,t3_erfye7,1579552415.0,"I'm on board, but I've got to figure out my own too. I can say that even though the young lady on the Youtube channel, Manes by Mell, despite having very curly hair has helped me out considerably. She's helped me have more success where product usage is concerned and also with diffusing, which I honestly didn't have much luck with until I followed her advise. 

Two things I've learned on her channel that have helped me more than any other channel ever:

1) How to diffuse without turning my hair into a frizzy rats' nest. I had no luck just shoving the ends of my hair into a diffuser bowl. Hell, I couldn't use a dryer with a diffuser on my hair in any capacity, but now I can. She says you should wait until your hair forms a cast before going in close with the diffuser. Game changer for me. I still wont throw my ends into a diffuser and instead prefer to use my hard hat dryer first AND then go at the roots with the diffuser and also the ends, but still not with the ends in the diffuser. Hair is much better off this way. 

&#x200B;

2) How to determine how much product you should use and how to apply! I've actually had good luck brushing DevaCurl styling cream through my hair, scrunching (but with open hand like Swavy Curly Courtney), then just smoothing some DevaCurl gel over the top. Today I did the same thing, but with Kinky Curly Curling Custard first instead of the styling cream. Results are generally more consistent overall."

Swavy Curly Courtney from YouTube had a nice review."
Wavyhair,few2y9m,t1_fevv4r6,1579404723.0,You should check out the All About Curls line at Sally when you are out of your other products.  They have a low poo and also the conditioner is not too heavy for my similarly wavy hair. They are reasonably priced and you can often order online and get like 30% off of a $50 order.

todayilearned,fenabct,t1_fen25q7,1579280393.0,"Maybe my argument doesn't hold weight in the above example. I still stand by my position though. I generally don't believe we should do ""character assessments"" for those hoping to receive organs, with the exception of maybe let's not give somebody's kidney to a convicted murderer. 

Whether or not somebody is willing to donate is generally objective, not subjective. We have a finite number of ethically harvested, usable organs. We have to determine who gets them. Those unwilling to donate but willing to receive an organ should not be given the priority over somebody else who would donate to the organ pool. Those willing to pay into the system should be given priority over those who aren't. 

If we have an organ NOBODY on the donors list can use, I can't see it going to waste, so then let the person who is unwilling to donate their own organs have it.

In any event, it doesn't matter what either of us think unless, of course, we get a chance to vote on this, and at this point, I don't recall having seen it on my ballot."

todayilearned,fem24aj,t1_feloh8e,1579237258.0,"This makes sense and I imagine it is possible for a decedent to have this without providers knowing? If that’s the case, there should be a clear exemption for this kind of stuff. I would have no problem with my organs going to somebody who would donate theirs, but can’t."
todayilearned,fem1kuh,t1_felnc0j,1579236778.0,"Organs, at this point in time are a scarce resource. We don’t have enough to give to everybody, and thus have to determine who gets priority. I can see giving an organ to somebody who opts out of donating if potential recipients have been exhausted. That said, if two people are an equal match, and both are able to receive the organ timely, and both are in equally bad shape, then the person who would give back if they could should be first priority. Why would we prioritize the person who is hoping to receive an organ while stating they wouldn’t donate?"
todayilearned,fem07rl,t1_felf41d,1579235601.0,"That’s fucking ridiculous. It’s totally fair to exclude those who refuse to donate for selfish reasons. We should implement that rule in the U.S. Now, if you are willing and intend to donate, but would be a terrible candidate, fine. If you just flat don’t want to, no cadaver heart for you! At the very least they should be at the bottom of the list with priority to those who are registered donors, then if we just happen to have extras, fine. Why should these people be able take advantage of a system they wouldn’t be willing to contribute to? Fuck. That. I’m triggered. Where is my safe space?"
personalfinance,fekegd2,t1_fejuw7s,1579198338.0,"Railway is right. I am sure your dad would have been cool with you calling around. 

My dad died unexpectedly, I didn't have the money to bury him. I called my uncle to ask for help. I think he more or less expected that he'd pay for it anyway, but my youngest sister and I intended to each pay half of what he was out after all the cash in dad's bank account, old life insurance policy, etc. had, been exhausted. That said, I still wouldn't have wanted to be a spendthrift when my uncle was fronting the cash. How rude would that have been? 

I know dad wouldn't have cared what box I put him in, so I chose the second least expensive box. I also opted not to embalm. Then my uncle arrived with his uncle checkbook, and the lady who was helping me saw the checkbook and got dollar signs in her eyes. She not so subtly insinuated that I hadn't chosen the cheapest options, but that I could have perhaps chosen better with some financial backing. Fuck. That. Bitch. I was way too nice back then. To make things worse, there was no sign in book on the day of the funeral. We had to ask for one. I wish I'd thought to speak to a manager or leave a scathing Yelp review. Dad looked really good, so there's that, but still."
personalfinance,fekcle0,t1_fek1lzn,1579197231.0,"Yes, and as far as I'm concerned, that's a perfectly legitimate use for donated bodies. I read a while back that even severed legs are used to test shoes and the like."

tifu,fek629o,t1_fek45go,1579193365.0,Once my grandma told me that my grandpa surprised her by returning home from leave and that my uncle was born about 9 months later. That was fairly risque for her. I can't imagine hearing these other things coming out of my grandmother's mouth.
Genealogy,fejuwv9,t1_fejtvyb,1579186416.0,"It appears so. Or, thats’s what the deal on my FamilySearch says. We share a common ancestor named Leanora Hankins. I suspect many, many folks share her as an ancestor. It’s funny because, so far, all of these people are related through my paternal grandfather’s line, but none through my paternal grandmother’s side, so far, though as some have said, it’s possible and maybe even probable that we are related in more than one way."

Genealogy,fej2p97,t1_fej0t8s,1579154676.0,"It’s truly amazing how many lines descend from one person over just three or four generations, let alone 10 or more. The bright side though is that we have tools like FamilySearch.org where, if you’ve built enough of a tree, it can intersect with somebody else’s, and another somebody else’s until you have this giant web. 

You can actually search for famous historical people and see if you may have any relation. I know the info isn’t always 100% correct, but you can do some work to verify info... if you’re so inclined, of course; I know not everybody will be willing to do so. 

It is interesting to see how some of these relations are made. For instance, I was able to find Aaron Burr and Abraham Lincoln, then check our relationship. If all info is correct, I share common ancestors with both men through different lines, but both on my dad’s side. Burr would be my 7th cousin, 8 times removed. Lincoln would be my 8th cousin, 3 times removed."
