Pets,fgdx21b,t1_fgc5d9d,1580687892.0,"Unfortunately I live in a one bed apartment so this isn’t quite possible. If I had space this would be a great solution to test out. 

I grew up with cats, so I’m familiar with those signals, but with him there is nothing. If he’s purring, he’ll stop and turn to me. Otherwise it’s just this look. I’ve never had a cat do this consistently before"
Pets,fgdwr82,t3_exg800,1580687754.0,"So just want to give an update. First off thank you everyone for the advice and insight. A lot of really good suggestions. 

I called the shelter first thing this morning and spoke with the manager about what was going on. She was really surprised that this was happening, and she questioned everything I had been doing: was I giving him enough space? Did I leave him alone? Did I let him approach me? Did I show him that I was the one giving him food? Etc etc

Unfortunately I live in a one bed apartment, and so I could not quarantine him to one room to get him adjusted to the new environment. The look he gave me before he attacked occurred more frequently as I had him. No real indicators of being upset except for this look. I asked the manager if there was anything else I could do, as I was genuinely scared of this cat. She said that it could just take time, but that she would not blame me if I wanted to bring him back. He is a beautiful cat, so my guess/hope is that she was thinking they’ll be able to match him up better with someone that has more space or with another cat. She saw the bite marks on my face (I was wearing jeans so she couldn’t see those) and looked incredibly surprised. 
I feel AWFUL about returning him and I was crying while doing so, but when one of the volunteers asked if I was okay, I just shuddered at the thought of trying to be around him and getting one of those looks again. 
I hope I’ll be able to adopt another cat one day, but for now I’ll be keeping a wide berth from all cats"
Pets,fgandef,t1_fg9iumx,1580653282.0,How do you know which ones have a more difficult rating?
Pets,fgai3uh,t1_fg8l48f,1580651460.0,"He has been given the all clear by the vet! Im a woman, and the volunteers at the shelter are a mix of men and women, so they were able to test out both and he didn’t seem to have any issues. 

Thank you - I’m trying to decide how long to test it out for. I really just want what’s best for him and I don’t want a family that’s scared of him (like I am )"
Pets,fgahdrw,t1_fg9foox,1580651303.0,"I thought that might have something to do with it, but he asks for full body scratches (both at the shelter and my home). I’m trying to keep my distance while petting while also showing love and trying to get used to him"

offmychest,fg5mymc,t1_fg5k1rd,1580531991.0,"I called my gp and they had me visit urgent care - currently on a topical and oral antibiotic. Hopefully no scarring comes from it as well. 

I’m just worried now because I was trying to spend time in the same room as him (far away from where he was) and he came over and sat on me. Then decided it would be a great time for another attack. Luckily no blood this time because I was wearing jeans and he bit my leg, button could tell where he bit me. I just want to make sure he finds the best home"
offmychest,fg5k1pf,t1_fg5jpbp,1580529596.0,"Luckily the one I adopted from has a 30 day “return policy”, but of course they try not to do that. I know they would be okay with a return for the right reasons, but when I asked them about this, they said it just takes time. I’m just conflicted"

She asked me what was wrong and I said “this bed, it’s so comfy. It’s such a good place to sleep!” She told me to go back asleep and I fell back on my bed dead asleep. I don’t remember a thing"
AskWomen,ffjiy08,t3_etn8am,1579999266.0,"It’s because I do what I want without giving a shit of what others think about me. It’s been nice at the climbing gyms because the dudes there see me as an equal because of this and treat me as a friend rather than an object. The bro’s who come up to me in the gym thinking “they can show me up” (they literally say this to my face after) are shown who’s boss relatively quickly. 
I’m not quite as strong at work, so I can put in my two cents there"

AskWomen,ferqf6u,t3_eqepgd,1579357162.0,"If you have a favorite exercise, join a group focused on that! (I love climbing, so I joined a gym, tried to go consistently on the same night, and am about to start attending the women’s nights. I still wouldn’t say I’m friends with the people, but I’m definitely friendly with a bunch of people which helps a lot. Having something you love in common really helps too)
I also have been trying to regularly go to the same coffee shop - again, I’m not yet friends, but you start to see the same people and get friendly.
It takes a long time though! I’m looking forward to finally settling in"
