fatlogic,fddfpye,t3_eks3ma,1578310231.0,"I understand wanting escape the circle of fad and extreme diets that donâ€™t work except for separating you from your money; but thatâ€™s not a reason to NOT get healthy.  I hate that these groups seem to be actively discouraging people from improving their health under the guise of body positivity and self love.  By all means, love yourself and your body at any size, but thereâ€™s no greater act of self love than to take active steps to improve your health and to realize your bodyâ€™s full potential."
rareinsults,fd2eyeo,t1_fd254pm,1578146246.0,Thatâ€™s pretty clever actually... plus â€œshadow banâ€ sounds like something out of a fantasy novel
fatlogic,fczifyi,t3_ejohk7,1578101952.0,"Pretty insulting to all the marathoners I know who are in their 60â€™s.  You will do your body good, and have less health struggles, if you work out, eat right, and maintain a healthy body weight.  Disabled people and people with injuries can still work out (modifies to their abilities).  So much of this just seems to enable laziness.  Before anyone gets upset, yes there are certain conditions that might limit or prevent this, but come on- most people can lose the weight and be healthy if they actually just try and stop trying to justify their feelings."
fatlogic,fczgd8f,t1_fczfsf9,1578100655.0,"Agreed, Iâ€™m a 6â€™0 woman, about 190lbs and I wear a size 9.  I also have a fair bit of muscle, so I carry it well.  Still, people donâ€™t believe me when I tell them how much I weigh."
awfuleverything,fcyo1ux,t1_fcyn75m,1578083657.0,"Temporary, and it seems like itâ€™s never â€œgoodâ€ enough.  I understand the body dysmorphia (I have struggled with eating disorders in the past), which is why going to gym has been a life saver for me.  I got past the eating disorder, but the weight gain still made me depressed and anxious (for years).  Medication alone didnâ€™t help, I had to go to the gym and work, and meet people just like me who were looking to improve their lives.  It became less about how my body looked, and more about realizing and appreciating what my body is capable of - I hope these people can find that.

That being said, itâ€™s the shortcuts that bother me.  There are no shortcuts in life.  You have to do the work.  Some people might have better resources or genetics, but a muscular physique canâ€™t be bought, you can only do the work."

ChoosingBeggars,fcwhnyn,t1_fcwggm3,1578025880.0,"Actually I have, and have tried some great products - but I didnâ€™t like the wait for shipping  and minimum purchase price.  I really donâ€™t smoke all that much, so when I was getting it that way Iâ€™d have to plan in advance.  I like the convenience of going to a shop, and since they are privatized, I like to support the local small businesses.  We have one chain store, and the rest are mom and pop; I actually have a buddy from the gym opening one shortly so naturally Iâ€™ll be supporting his business"
antiMLM,fcwerk9,t3_ej8b69,1578023769.0,Sounds like she had to leave her social work job to take care of her autistic son.  This is one of the reasons I hate MLMâ€™s - they exploit people who are just trying to get by in difficult circumstances.

Even if I could get it cheaper from a dealer, itâ€™s just not worth the hassle and awkwardness (for me)."

Probably why some go so hard to recruit, they realize itâ€™s the only way to make money and â€œmoveâ€ product."

There is legislation in place to protect workers from exposure to blood and OPIMs for this very reason.

vegan,fcnc457,t1_fcna2uw,1577808489.0,"Agree 100%.  If a person canâ€™t stomach that cats are obligate carnivores, donâ€™t get one.  One shouldnâ€™t force animals to conform to human concepts of morality.  As much as it makes vegans uncomfortable, eating meat is natural for cats, and animals eating each other is the way of the world for thousands of years.  Eating animals is not necessary for human survival: I oppose the current system of animal agriculture, as well the environmental damage it has caused.  Forcing animals into veganism is just more sapiens high-handedness and is straight up animal abuse."
