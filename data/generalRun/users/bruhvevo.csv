AskReddit,ffgkpis,t1_ffgk6fj,1579908463.0,"That’s fair, I get that. I interpreted it far more as some guy who seems to think he has women “totally figured out” and was being arrogant, but it’s up for interpretation. Either way, it’s a sad mindset to hold."
AskReddit,ffgjjhd,t1_ffgjdw7,1579907693.0,Expressing a statement and promoting it as fact is not the same as expressing emotions.
AskReddit,ffgiyim,t1_ffghuol,1579907311.0,"Yeah dude, you’re completely right. Men are not supposed to have emotions at all, they are actually supposed to be rock solid pillars of stoicism and strength 24/7, showing absolutely no emotion. Not only that, but any sign of emotion is actually a weakness inherent in that man that he should hammer out until eventually he shows no emotions at all. Because that’s what every single woman wants out of a man, an emotionless brick that never shows emotion.

Yeah man, you sure have women figured out."
