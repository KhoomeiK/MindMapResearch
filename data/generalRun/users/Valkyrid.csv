Other things impacted my marks as a student were whether i enjoyed the content or not. - The units i actually enjoyed i scored quite highly, the ones i didnt dragged my score down.

For example:

operating systems: 55%

Same as university, and my final score was 87.

Note taking isnt for everyone. I learned this myself, whenever i tried to take notes id miss important information, and the info i did get down was super messy and hard to read. 

I found that i retained more if i just listened and fidgeted."
