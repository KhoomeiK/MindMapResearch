bleach,ffc0y9t,t1_ffc0p3x,1579788740.0,"Bruh I'm talking about after the Sakura war fiasco. He dropped many subliminal hints and also said that's there's something ""Not _quite_ bleach"" (emphasis on quite) in a stream. He tweeted the burn the witch stuff in early Jan and lo and behold, it's been announced. He has scans but can't release them yet.

Stop with the red herrings. This is barely related. He confirmed multiple times that he didn't know about this but it seemed to be bleach because using bleach would be a dick move from Shueisha."
bleach,ffbmxgt,t1_ffbms9a,1579773374.0,"Fam Jaymes and Kincho have been saying this *directly* for over a month. They both announced that it would be something burn the witch related. Kincho also said that you will get your bleach news soon before saying it was burn the witch. Jaymes said the same but put bleach in parentheses a loooong time ago. When they announced a month ago, Yonkou said the same after the two.
