food,fc5aojf,t1_fc56l9a,1577451288.0,"Here you go :

DOUGH :

**The base**

\- Flour (between 250-500g)

\- Yeast : if dried, 2 g for a max of 500g of flour. if fresh double it and dissolve it in a bit of water.

\- Water, the quantity depends on the flour type. (will see how much later)

\- 1 Tea spoon of salt 

\- 1 Table spoon of sugar

\- 1.5 Table spoon of olive oil  


**additives :**

You can add anything you want: grains (Sesame,Nigel...), pepper..

&#x200B;

Preparation :

\- Put the flour in a bawl.

\- If dried yeast, mix it with the floor. If fresh, pour it on a side of the flour.

\- Add the salt, olive oil and additives on the other sides.

\- Add the sugar on top of the flour.

\- The water, **Mum's advice:** put the warm water next to you and using a spoon, pour a table spoon of water over the flour and start mixing with 2 fingers in a spiral move. Add more table spoons of water while mixing until you see the powder-like mixture turn into shards of dough, add one last spoon of water. mix a bit in the bawl.

\- Pull out the ball of dough (and the small remaining shards of dough) on a table that you already floured.

\- Start kneading, knead as hard as a kitten wanting milk from his mum. Knead knead for 10 min.

\- While kneading, if the dough is too dry add water, if too fluid add flour.

\-When done, put it in a floured bawl. Cover it with transparent elastic film. And, let it rest 24 h in a warm place (25-30 Â° C).

\- You should see it expand.

\- pull it out (help yourself by putting a bit of flour on the edges of the dough)

\- Knead, knead, knead. Ask your cat for help, he knows better.

\- put it back for 24h. Repeat for a total of 3 or 4 days.

This will result in 3 or 4 30 cm pizzas.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tomato Sauce : 

\- 1 red onion. 2 garlic heads

\- 2-3 tomatos (juicy ones)

\- 2 spoon of industrial tomatos

\- salt, pepper, basilica and paprika.

Perp:

\- Boil the tomato for 5-7 min 

\- cut the onion into small cubes or rap it.

\- clean and smash the garlic. 

\-in a hot pan, with some oil, let the onion & garlic sweat and add 1 cube of sugar.

\- Once the onions lost some water, add the boiled tomato by squashing them by hands over the pan (careful they are still hot).

\- add the industrial tomato

\- add the salt and spices.

\- lower the fire, let it cook for long (1h at the lowest)

\- From time to time, agitate the mixture.

\-in the end, add the herbs.

This will result to 3 or 4 sauce dozes.

&#x200B;

Cooking :

\- preheat the oven.

\- pull out the dough and  knead it a little bit to make the dried crest disappear.

\- split it into 3 or 5 smaller dough parts.

\- freeze the ones you won't use by wrapping them in plastic film.

\- flatten your dough using 2 fingers starting from the center to the perimeter.

\- if necessary use a rolling pin  (or even a jar x) ).

\- pour a little bit of sauce (I like it a bit dry)

\- put cheese on top of it. ( I used Mozzarella)

&#x200B;

Toppings:

There are only 2 rules :

\- If they are raw, you will cook it longer (because they will emit their own water)

\- They need to be visible (no pizza shall be overcrowded)

&#x200B;

I cooked it in an electric over heated from top and bottom at 250Â°C on a iron plate with a sheet of baking paper under it for 25-30 min (Again, I like it dry)

\- if you have a convection oven or a pizza stone, the time will be lowered. the higher the temperature the lower cooking time."
