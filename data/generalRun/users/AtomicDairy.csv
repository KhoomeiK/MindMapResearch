Woodwork,fezce0c,t1_fezayaw,1579455919.0,Might want to use plywood or joined boards. The panels get knocked around and MDF might chip and crumble in that scenario.
Jigsawpuzzles,fez5op1,t1_feyuung,1579454025.0,Many thanks!
Jigsawpuzzles,fex32dm,t1_fewtgbq,1579423493.0,Thank you!
howto,few6ulr,t1_fetzvmm,1579406140.0,Multiple children for one. They keep things hopping. But we also love to entertain and having people over is so much fun. That is one of the factors that led to the development of this table. We can clean up the dining table in seconds by putting the panels back in without disturbing the puzzle or other project we were working on.
howto,feu38oo,t1_fetj6n2,1579382711.0,That's a really great idea. We will incorporate that when we build another one of these!
woodworking,feu2zra,t1_fepjupb,1579382655.0,That is an excellent idea and description. We definitely should have talked to you before we built this. If we build another one of these we will definitely use this plan because liquid spills are the one thing that could completely ruin an underlying puzzle.
DiWHYNOT,fetwpza,t1_fetpiy8,1579380814.0,Thank you! Binge away! We're always building new stuff and making videos!
DiWHYNOT,fetwmkj,t1_fetqifm,1579380780.0,"She usually breaks them up and puts them back in the box to build in the future. She's building quite the library of puzzles, and this large work space is allowing her to get 2,000-piece puzzles now."
woodworking,fetwgzw,t1_fetsc9s,1579380723.0,"That's a very smart solution. They say that if it's a stupid idea and it works, then it isn't a stupid idea! Your solution doesn't have the spilled drink problem ours does either!"
somethingimade,fetvrpv,t1_fetu0fc,1579380574.0,Thanks! We figure it's worth the risk.
DiWHYNOT,fet8d35,t1_fesyhld,1579372709.0,Thank you and thank you!!!

DiWHYNOT,fesu06v,t1_feqptxv,1579368957.0,Exactly!
Woodwork,festuck,t1_ferzzbb,1579368931.0,"The panels fit tightly enough that crumbs aren't much of a problem, but liquid would definitely be a showstopper. We use place mats when eating and put cheap dollar store plastic tablecloths down when hosting messy eaters. We talked about making a single panel for the top to defeat spills but the top would have been too heavy for our puzzle maker to lift. So we accepted the risk and went for multiple panels."
howto,fest80z,t1_ferwa8p,1579368800.0,Thank you!
howto,fest6j5,t1_feqejly,1579368786.0,"Lots of parties, weekly book club, college students bringing friends over, a D&D club last night, and various craft building projects. The funny thing is that everyone prefers the colors-up version of the table."
howto,fessoxi,t1_feqvs9k,1579368618.0,That would work perfectly!
somethingimade,fesskte,t1_ferpvs0,1579368591.0,"The panels fit pretty tightly, which takes care of the crumbs, but liquid would have no trouble leaking through. The only alternative was to build a single-piece top but that would have been too heavy to lift for our puzzle maker. Our solution has been to use place mats and, when children are around, use a cheap dollar store tablecloth to catch spills."
somethingimade,fess0w0,t1_ferlp24,1579368416.0,The colored strips are pretty cool on their own. We thought it would be too loud to leave up all the time but it actually fits the kitchen very well. Color side up is now our default configuration for this table.
somethingimade,fesrrsk,t1_feqyn1a,1579368338.0,Outstanding idea! We'll go post it there too!
somethingimade,fesrmaa,t1_feqoy32,1579368291.0,"We definitely did consider that and planned to put LED strips under the black rails around the edges of the table. There are six lights directly over the table controlled by a dimmer and two hanging lights over the bar next to the table. With everything at 100% it is very bright on the puzzle surface. So bright that we were able to video everything with zero additional lighting. The other problem would have been getting power to the LEDs and hiding the cord. So for now we are happy with our current lighting, but the table is ready to receive the LED strips if we ever decide to add them."
somethingimade,fesqwg4,t1_ferbhqr,1579368055.0,Thanks! We try to have fun when making these!
somethingimade,fepr63b,t1_fepqy45,1579328508.0,"The panels fit pretty closely together so most debris doesn't drop to the lower level, but it can if the crumbs are small enough. Liquid would definitely go through the cracks, unfortunately. The only alternative was to make a single panel but that would have been too large and unwieldy for our puzzle-maker to lift. So we went with five closely-fit panels and use place mats for meals. But the crumb problem is pretty nonexistent because we no longer have small children. If we did have younger kids we'd probably have some crumb/leak issues."
woodworking,feppoz3,t1_feppdln,1579327168.0,Wow! Thank you! We've been building stuff for years and decided to start making videos of our projects. We have dozens of future projects planned as we continue to make things and turn out a new video every Friday.
somethingimade,fepkoaq,t1_fepke9k,1579323001.0,Many thanks! Really appreciate your comment!!!
somethingimade,fepj23z,t1_fepiofy,1579321777.0,Thank you!!!
somethingimade,fepj0we,t1_fepibun,1579321752.0,"Agreed. We originally just used it for puzzles but now it's used for all sorts of projects, and we can hide everything in seconds."
somethingimade,fepitpc,t1_fepih1f,1579321607.0,You're right. We were fools to think the secret door wouldn't be a selling point.
somethingimade,fepgrq1,t1_fepgobs,1579320095.0,Thank you! This sort of comment will just encourage us to make more stuff!
woodworking,fepghl9,t1_fepge7n,1579319899.0,Great idea!
somethingimade,fepfgce,t1_fepfdai,1579319170.0,Thanks! It has turned out to be a really useful table. Much more useful than we expected it to be!
somethingimade,fepdokf,t1_fepdi1g,1579317954.0,"That could work, like a rubber gasket maybe. We thought about it and decided to just make the panels fit tightly. It's not perfect but it works fairly well."
howto,fepdhuw,t1_fepcomg,1579317826.0,Thank you! We had a lot of fun making it!
woodworking,fepdgxc,t1_fepcqge,1579317808.0,"That can happen. The joints are fairly tight, which is why we have a crank to raise the end panel for removal, but there are gaps. The alternative was a single panel and that would have been heavy and unwieldy. So we went for five smaller panels."
howto,fepddkd,t1_fepcr0b,1579317745.0,"Thanks! We sized it to handle 2,000 piece puzzles but it may go larger. It depends on the dimensions of the finished puzzle."
woodworking,fepcctb,t1_fepbvnq,1579317054.0,Thank you!
somethingimade,fepcc7d,t1_fepbpjh,1579317042.0,Thank you! Can confirm this is pet-proof when the panels are on.

somethingimade,fepa3hr,t1_fep8enm,1579315542.0,"Thank you so much!!

The table is sealed with a few layers of polycrylic to protect from general spills, but as far as protecting the puzzle below we have nothing. 

We try to eat off of place mats to deter from spills and cross our fingers that nothing gets spilled."
woodworking,fep4cga,t1_feonwav,1579311849.0,"Thank you! Fortunately our kids are college age, so we are mostly safe from the kind of spills you are talking about. But we totally understand your point. We discussed a single panel top but couldn't figure out how to make it easily removable and storable, but that would be the best way to deal with spills."
DiWHYNOT,fep0568,t1_feozh10,1579309179.0,"The puzzle table isn't for everyone, but it's definitely made a noticeable difference of comfort in our home! We looked at doing the felt idea, but building a whole table worked better for us. I can assure you that a TON of research went into this project and we're super satisfied with it."
woodworking,feot94n,t1_feosz9u,1579305068.0,Thank you!! Right back at you!
howto,feorae2,t1_feoqfh2,1579304376.0,"Nope, we just hope no one spills. We eat off of placemats when we dine at the table and cross our fingers that no one spills"
DiWHYNOT,feoqe2g,t1_feoo8k0,1579303926.0,Thank you so much! That was actually our inspiration!
howto,feoqcvi,t1_feoohv8,1579303906.0,Thank you!
DiWHYNOT,feoqave,t1_feopjwk,1579303873.0,"It is not, but we've been lucky thus far and fingers crossed that we continue to be lucky!"
DiWHYNOT,feoltaq,t1_feol5g4,1579301962.0,"We use placemats whenever we eat to deter anything from getting in the cracks. So far, we've been good, but if anything were to fall down the clean-up wouldn't be horrendous or anything because the deck is just painted wood."
somethingimade,feoj63l,t1_feohghe,1579300839.0,That is so exciting!! Congratulations!! Send us pictures if you end up making your own puzzle table!!
somethingimade,feoh639,t1_feogvnv,1579300037.0,Go make one! It has really decluttered our dining room even though we use it all the time.
DiWHYNOT,feogu5x,t1_feoglck,1579299964.0,Definitely worth your time. This table has really decluttered our eating area and guests have no idea there is a puzzle under the table top.

howto,feof1ag,t1_feoeutw,1579299206.0,Exactly. We made it deep enough to allow the puzzle box to be left in place too so the whole puzzle is concealed at meal time. It has really worked out well!
DiWHYNOT,feoeq87,t1_feocxso,1579299111.0,Thanks! It really frees up the dining room because we can leave puzzles in place even when we use the table to eat on. It allows us to build much larger puzzles because we can leave them set up for weeks or months at a time.
howto,feoee4u,t1_feod2ey,1579299035.0,"Thanks! We had a lot of fun building it and use it pretty much every day. In fact, there's a D&D group arriving here in an hour to use it."

DiWHYNOT,fedzzi6,t1_fedzgl3,1579023456.0,"Excellent point. Literally everyone who has visited has said the same thing, so we cannibalized the old door for spare parts. That old door's hardware is now part of the dining/gaming table we have in the kitchen. With the old door now truly gone we will leave the secret door up permanently."
mealtimevideos,fedhxwn,t1_fedgcwc,1579011981.0,Sounds interesting. I've never seen someone do a cross-country trip like this to get video of all of the filming locations.
DiWHYNOT,fdszcs1,t1_fdsm25q,1578709912.0,"Well I just learned a lot. Thanks for suggesting SDR. I've added this to our project list to see if there is anything we can use it for.

&#x200B;

We have been experimenting by pivoting the antenna to see if it changes reception. We hadn't thought about testing it horizontally. We'll try that!"
DiWHYNOT,fdsy4w4,t1_fdsd9rc,1578709460.0,Unfortunate. Line of sight transmission works great until there is a hill or building in the way.
DiWHYNOT,fdsr14u,t1_fdsc9ck,1578706830.0,We're in a suburb built on a swamp near the ocean with no hills anywhere nearby and mostly farms on the non-ocean side. Not a lot of broadcast towers near us and the ones that are nearby are clustered together. So we may already be receiving all we will ever receive. But we will be rescanning soon to see if we can get any more.
DiWHYNOT,fdspya5,t1_fdsc2hg,1578706430.0,"It works and it was easy to make, both things that we like. The picture is significantly clearer than we were expecting, which really surprised us. We are pretty happy with the results."

somethingimade,fdrljsg,t1_fdrkukk,1578686315.0,Thanks! Half of the reason we build is for the fun. Otherwise it's just a job.
DiWHYNOT,fdrl7xb,t1_fdrh5mz,1578686141.0,True and totally agree. I was just saying the broadcast quality was as good as if we were playing a Blu-ray or DVD. As a kid of the 70s I am used to broadcast TV having less quality and snow in it. This new stuff is way better than that.
DiWHYNOT,fdrl1zt,t1_fdriz2y,1578686043.0,"Good point. We are going to try and see if it picks up further-out stations this weekend. We have the Atlantic Ocean to our east so everything we'd pick up is inland from us, so that cuts down the directions we'd have to point the antenna. I'd love to see if we can pick up more."
somethingimade,fdrfios,t1_fdrefaa,1578683785.0,"We mostly wanted to see if we could do it because this is something we've never done before. You make a valid point, we just wanted to have some fun and see if this would actually work."
somethingimade,fdrew6i,t1_fdrbre6,1578683612.0,"Right now we're getting four but we will rescan this weekend to see if there are more. We suspect there are at least a half-dozen more possible. One of our problems is that the Atlantic Ocean is to our east, so we only have half the potential broadcasting geography a lot of other people have."
BeginnerWoodWorking,fdrc16o,t1_fdrb426,1578682367.0,"That's fair, but it's the fun of building it and seeing something that you made actually work that inspires us to make things and videos like this. Realistically speaking, you're totally right, we just like to make stuff."

specializedtools,fc79o4x,t1_fc79a1n,1577501220.0,Agreed. Our shop is on the front of the house and has two windows so we had to make our plugs look like the blinds on the other windows. We like the sunshine when the weather is nice and just put the panels in the other garage when we take them down.

Tools,fc72m31,t1_fc72ag8,1577495874.0,"Glad you like it! An artist friend who does logos, among other things, did it for us. We told him we wanted something mid-century or Googie style and he came up with that design. The sign itself is a vinyl print from Staples. You can get banners printed online and pick them up at the store. We just cut the vinyl logo out of the banner material, glued it to some plywood, and hung it on a French cleat on the wall so we can move it around if we want to."
Tools,fc6ajt2,t1_fc69yx0,1577476068.0,"Exactly right! And it's accurate. We close the shutters when in action and when it is dark outside, which is why it is a red Z. We like the look so much that we are going to put the hazard tape and Z on the shop door on the opposite wall. But that door doesn't have to be closed for light management so the door Z will be black. All of this entertains us and makes the shop even more fun to work in!"
