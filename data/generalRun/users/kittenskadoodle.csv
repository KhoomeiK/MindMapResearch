I have a good friend who is everything I could want in a relationship; smart, strong, brave, graceful, beautiful, and (bonus) she loves me too. I have loved her, and been in lust for her, for 40 years now, believe it or not. She just gets more beautiful to me with each passing year.

Two problems: She's happily married to a wonderful man; I would never hurt him. And we both know that an intimate relationship would be short lived; we would hate each other in short order. Our personalities are just too different.

Our friendship is more important than anything, so we enjoy each others platonic company when we can. Her husband and kids are some of my favourite people in the world; I am happy to be a good family friend. And we have learned to appreciate the bitter-sweet knowledge of what we can't have.

Cooking,fe8wn6q,t3_eo5loo,1578931900.0,"I bought a little induction burner on sale and was very impressed; enough that it earned a permanent place on one side of my glass top range. Very fast and powerful, but not the precise control I wanted, ie, setting it on 1 didn't give me a low temperature, it just took longer to burn the pot.

Still, when the chance came to get a top line (and very expensive) induction range I didn't hesitate. And I love it, I wouldn't go back for anything; not even gas.

It is so fast: water boils in a minute, scrambled eggs in 30 seconds, saute you are up to temperature in seconds.

The best part though is the precision. When I turn it up or down the reaction is instant: rolling boil, light simmer, gentle warm, back to rolling boil, all as quick as can be said. My unit also comes with a sensor probe that attaches with a magnet to the pot and talks to the control by bluetooth. I set it for 130F and it stays at 130F.  Bonus sous vide!

Because the top never gets really hot it's very easy to keep clean. If the control is left on but there's no pot then it just turns off, nothing happens. The only drawback is my favourite saucepan (an old Queen Anne) makes a faint humming noise and there is usually an internal fan running, but I'm used to it now and hardly notice the background noises.

Good induction tends to be expensive and they don't all have the same precision. Read the reviews carefully."
