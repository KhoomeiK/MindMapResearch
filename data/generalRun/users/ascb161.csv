Stick to one way and make it harder and faster with time. But first - ask her what she likes, if she want you to improve your technique. Communication is the key! :)"

AskReddit,fcvxgvu,t3_eixc75,1578012319.0,"I met my bf on Tinder like 5 months ago, we have been together for 2. I have never been that happy, he is amazing man, so smart, beautiful, he cares about me and listens to me. After toxic relationship I am so happy to be in healthy one. Sometimes I feel he is too good to be true, I am so lucky.
On the other hand - I got few friends from Tinder and one stalker (he cannot reach me in any way, so it's okay now)."
