YouShouldKnow,ffvxjhk,t3_erc5zy,1580276350.0,"Testimonial: My parents' iMac (8 or so years old) is super slow when booting mac os from the HDD. I'm talking 15 minutes to get to the login screen, 5 to get the desktop, and a few more to open what needs to be opened. When I boot Debian GNU/Linux (with LXDE) from a flash drive (Flash/Solid State(?)) over usb 2.0 it's still not optimal, but you can actually open Firefox in a matter of seconds.

Note: I am aware that the drive is most likely failing. I urge them to back up the near 500gb of family photos, bank documents, and just general history that they seem to go on and on about when yelling at me not to use it. But alas, the drive is too important to fail so they say."
YouShouldKnow,ffvudoy,t3_evgrt1,1580273525.0,"YSK this might not apply to older cars.

My 2004 Hyundai Sonata (rest in peace) was misfiring due to a bad spark plug. The check engine light was solid, but went out every few mins. But I didn't need to have the light on to tell me the engine was not working. It was the RPM gauge fluctuating from sub 1k to 3k RPM and a loss of most engine power. I near pissed myself when I was driving home from the mall and I lost acceleration right after clearing an intersection. 

I did pull over, called a shop, and they said to come in right away. I drove it there on failing power, flashers on, and cars honking at me. But here's the kicker. **10 miles**. That's how far it was to the shop. When they hooked it up to their diagnostic tool, it was misfiring on cylinder 2. The repair was not expensive, but the car didn't last much longer. But that's a story for another thread."

gaming,ffp30ou,t3_eudrz6,1580085226.0,"OP, it might be worth evaluating what you place self worth on. Hear me out. I place a lot of self worth on my performance. When I see my performance in a game start to dip (be it due to my own mistakes or those of my team or ""lag"" ;3 ) I always get irrationally angry. I don't break physical objects, but rather become extremely toxic and it takes me a good bit to correct my behavior. 

I found out why this is: I see my self worth in my performance. When I see it fall, it is an attack on my worth. If I feel like I'm being useless, I get angry at that feeling of uselessness. I am in the process of separating my self worth and performance, and so far I've made it a while without being too ragey. 

While this may or may not be the case for you, I want to share my EXP here for others to see.

Note: What I described is common in people with anxiety/depression. It ***might*** be worth checking with a psychologist to see if you have that."
