ukbike,fg0mrv6,t1_fg0lni3,1580410925.0,"Meh i suppose i’ve given a bit of a “woah, woah” before. But i dont tend to get too phased. 

Just never found myself full on shouting at anyone before. 

I’ve blared at a couple of cars in the past i guess. But thats cos they cant hear you hermetically sealed into their mobile couch blasting tunes and talking to their boss on the mobile."
funny,fg0kdib,t1_fg07e04,1580409558.0,"Well. I mean. My own opinions aside.

If you listed all of the worlds religions calling them all fake you’d pretty much get it right. They are either all fake. Or all fake except one.

So a poster with say 1,000 religions on it which is 99.9% correct is at least pretty accurate."
ukbike,fg0jbc2,t1_fg0hbem,1580408947.0,"Gotta agree with the first part. Pedestrian attention is at times non existent. The number of people walking around looking at phones is staggering.

On my local cycle path i frequently see peoples’ children and dogs being much more aware than they are.

However... never really found myself cycling around shouting at people."
GrandTheftAutoV,fg0eavd,t3_ew61vn,1580405993.0,"A family member of mine just inexplicably bought my 6 year old son an occulus rift.

Don’t get me wrong i’m grateful for the gift. It’s way too much to be honest.

But... no-one really knows what to do with it. I play Xbox. My partner doesnt play and my son generally plays nintendo,  split screen console with me or Roblox.

It’s just sort of sitting there. Looking all expensive."
iamverybadass,fg0cy2u,t1_fg083xf,1580405173.0,"Exactly. It absolutely doesn’t. 

Often these fake tough guys THINK it does.

Ach well, what can i say?"
iamverybadass,fg0crf7,t1_ffzg7us,1580405060.0,"Woops. Not quite what i meant.

Whenever i’ve seem blokes wearing those jackets they are trying to promote a tough guy biker image. Looks a bit daft when they dont actually have a bike.

Oh well. I’ll leave that up there as a badge of my stupidity. I’ve grown a little today."
iamverybadass,ffzdqsg,t3_evzn10,1580373935.0,"Whenever you see someone wearing that kind if jacket trying to be badass just ask them ONE simple question:

“So, uh, what kind of motorbike do you have?”

There is no way gor them to say “I dont have one” without looking like an idiot."
worldnews,ffzc03f,t3_evufxl,1580371556.0,"Awwwwwww shite.

Here we go again. Vote yes/no proponents only JUST made up after last time. 

Loads of cars still have the ‘YES’ stickers in the rear window."
AskReddit,ffufri3,t3_ev5zdg,1580241025.0,"I have cried twice in 15 years.

One time was while high as fuck. Doesnt count.

The last was in summer when my dog died. I loved that fucker. He was my best friend."
Warframe,ffqx7aa,t1_ffqufhk,1580145673.0,"Aww agreed. 

I like the idea of a kinetic railgun. Sounds cool."
Warframe,ffqtp4y,t3_etlchh,1580143411.0,"I’m getting a bit fed up with constant hyper fantasy weapons bordering on magic. I want a bit more grounding in typical sci-fi/realistic weapons.

A grineer derived minigun, a semi-automatic 6 shot grenade launcher. A true high damage shoulder fired rocket launcher. Hand grenades. 

I’m a simple man. With simple tastes. There is plenty of room for you plasma shotguns and organic finger lasers... AND more typical weapon types too. 

Sometimes i think the aesthetic in warframe leans too far to one side over the other.

Sometimes it’s benificial to take a step back into a more grounded aesthetic."
Warframe,ffqt29f,t3_etuwq4,1580142996.0,"Kit guns. They all somehow look like bloody hair dryers. Not a fan of the designs.

Then theres’ the Hek. Undoubtably ugly but brutal and badass looking. Love it."
Warframe,ffqsalv,t3_eu7wd9,1580142486.0,"Have an Eternal war Valkyr and a duration focussed Volt on your team... Phenomenal melee setup.

Your attack speed and DPS will go through the roof. 

Mix it with weapons like the Ninkondi and Cassowar for truly comedic combo numbers."
Warframe,ffqs0xb,t1_ffq3wdj,1580142310.0,"Absolutely second this.

The Atamos is a fantastic weapon. Awesome damage, great on ammo consumption and fantastic crowd control.

Really, REALLY good and practical weapon."
Warframe,ffqns99,t3_euf102,1580139434.0,"None. And I probably wont. 

Much like my mini-nukes in fallout...

I’m terrified of using them incase i need them later."
Fallout,ffjbwws,t3_ete6w2,1579995060.0,"Fallout 3. First one i played and i was completely blown away. The desolate feeling, the exploration, the deep lore, the weird and bizarre sections like oasis and  tranquility lane. The shere variety in gear and playstyles. The awesome DLC. Not to mention Inon Zur’s breathtaking sound track. Wish i could wipe my memory and start it again. NV is also a masterpiece. 

Politically? Leftish, liberal leaning. Well, i was but if i’m honest completely disillusioned and embittered with politics in general. I’m disinterested bordering on depressed with it as i get older. I shall stop before i rant my ass off."
MotoUK,ffjaz6z,t3_etuehp,1579994506.0,"Yup. Also tried to spit my chewing gum out one time:

THUNK!

Stuck right on the inside of the visor."
