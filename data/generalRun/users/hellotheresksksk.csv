The fun thing is, I'm not getting invited to parties whatsoever and I didn't really know If I wanted to go, (my bbf was invited too but he couldn't make it) and I was thinking if I should even go. I decided I'd go and see what comes out, im a shy person most of the time, until like 1am it was boring as shit but then we went to a girl's party (4 gals) I and they made us dance (I have never danced in my fucking life). I'm telling u I have never had this much fun before. We danced for like 5h to songs I usually don't like, at first I was like, nah I'm not gonna dance but then I was like, fuck it im gonna have fun.
so at the end all I wanna say is: enjoy ur life as much as u possibly can, it's worth living it, no one knows what happens when we die"
