The LASave instagram account has weekly (sometimes daily) photos of the animals in the trucks showing disease, who are near death, clearly ill, and these animals are being sent into slaughter for human consumption. 

Joaquin is a big supporter of LASave and regularly attend these ""Vigils""- where anywhere from 20-100 people show up each week to protest the inhumane treatment of these animals, and to provide water, comfort, to sand in support of animal rights and  hopefully attract media coverage for the plight of the animals.
