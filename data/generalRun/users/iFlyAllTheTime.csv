Thanks for the detailed reply.

I'll try out the formula you've suggested, but I feel I haven't explained properly what I need to achieve.

AM/PM doesn't matter for what I'm doing. The numbers actually represent period values and not the actual time in the day. The table has a column that is meant to find out the difference between hours worked and hours scheduled.

It might be better with an example. Here's an overly simplified excerpt from what I'm working with:

Day | Scheduled Hours | Worked Hours | Over/Underworked
---|------------|---------------|----------------
Mon | 07:00 | 06:30 | -00:30
Wed | 08:00 | 08:42 | 00:42
Fri | 05:30 | 05:22 | -00:08
Total | 20:30 | 20:34 | 00:04

--------------------------------------------------------
I see what you're saying about how I've made my life difficult using the entry method that I have, but I'm not the only one to access to this file, and I was specifically requested that this be a feature. The file is accessed on mobile devices, and typing 4 digits, without having to switch the keyboard to type the colon after the first two, makes it a whole lot more convenient. I was ecstatic when I'd figured that custom format out, but if I can't figure this one out, I might be forced to consider ditching the custom format."
