Waking up in the dead of night, feeling incredibly well-rested, wondering to yourself ""Damn, did I oversleep? Am I late for work?"", getting ready to rush into your clothes and get to your commute. 

But then, you turn over your phone and see it's only 4:37am and you are actually losing out on more precious sleepy seconds. Your anxiety of being late turns to rage at not being asleep and fuuuuuck is it awful.

I fucking HATE that feeling."
Throwers,ffk3ynp,t3_ety1vp,1580015088.0,"From my experience, I'd say start Unresponsive.

Responsive play is very much more limited in what tricks you can do with the throw vs Unresponsive, and takes crazy amounts of reactionary skill. Unresponsive also requires a lot of control, but in a much different way. Of the two, I personally think Unresponsive is easier to learn.

You'll want to first learn how to Bind, and alongside it, throwing a Trapeze. That will be the foundation of your hobby. Literally every trick I know of utilizes these tricks to start and stop your circles.

Before you know it, you'll be moving on from string tricks to slacks, grinds, horizontals, and full body tricks. It goes quick, but maaaan....I wouldn't give up the journey I took to learn how to do all of this stuff for anything. It's very satisfying."
AnimalCrossing,ffk26ru,t3_etwohm,1580013522.0,"To sell merch. That's what it's ALWAYS about. 

If you think for one moment any of Nintendo's IPs exist to solely bring you enjoyment in video games, you're sorely mistaken.

Creating a character that the entire fanbase can instantly latch on to and relate with = more merch sales. Animal Crossing was in dire need of a character they could monetize heavily. Tom Nook and KK Slider just simply didn't push enough recognition or merch sales, so they had to get creative. They got more than they needed with Isabelle. 

She's cute, loveable, kind of ditzy, and super whimsical. She brings smiles to peoples faces. She was engineered for the role of Merch Queen. 

I know it's a crappy reality, but that's just how it is. Her existence probably brought about countless millions of excess revenue that Nintendo wouldn't have had if she didn't exist. If anything, we shouldn't be salty that Animal Crossing has a Merch Queen. We should be happy. Because more merch = more profit, which in turn = more Animal Crossing support from the Big N."

Short /o/ sounds are exactly as she is pronouncing it. Long /o/ states the O's name. This particular occurrence is what we call a ""Baby"" /o/, which makes the traditional short /u/ sound instead.
