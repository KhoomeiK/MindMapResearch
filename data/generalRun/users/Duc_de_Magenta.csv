tucker_carlson,fcnxs5e,t1_fcnvs2i,1577820522.0,"It's a highly misleading title. The VA gun confiscation push & the boom in ""sanctuary counties"" is utterly unrelated to the UN's hiring mandates. Likewise implying that a ""disarmament officer"" is going to be *targeting* NY b/c they're working in NYC is completely misleading to those who don't realise that the UN is headquarters...in NYC. Similarly, the UN has called for disarmament since it's inception; that's not a ""new"" thing."

MapPorn,fcnnqfv,t1_fcnlqr0,1577814970.0,"That's a reason I specified \*southern\* Greenland. Greenland is larger than Alaska! That the Inuit & Dorset settled or traversed the northern & western bits near modern Canada doesn't magically give them indigenous status over the southern & eastern bits near Iceland. Less a \*when\* question than an \*where\* question; you could say ""well Iceland isn't in the Arctic Cycle"" but this janky-ass map includes Kamchatka so I wouldn't take Arctic to strictly (another commenter said it was just a poorly titled map & not actually related to indigenous peoples of the Arctic but instead member nations of a special interest group)."
tucker_carlson,fcnkk4x,t3_ei2167,1577813356.0,"That's...not at all how that works. That position is a simple administrative officer, hence the ""family duty station"" business in the posting. If they were going to disarm Americans...this wouldn't be a ""safe"" location. That office focuses primarily on ""hot"" conflicts around the world, which is why ""reintegration"" is in the title. Not a fan of the UN by any stretch but Americans & our rights are under enough real threats from state & Federal gov't - we don't need to be searching out conspiracies."

Libertarian,fcb204p,t3_egedd8,1577581183.0,"The major issue is that libertarians are, in a manner of speaking, radical centrists/contrarians. Part of this is the well-worn cliche that they ""split the difference"" between GOP & Dem rhetoric. Another is that the ""average libertarian"" voter/activist is assumed to be a young white man with a rural militia vibe or some tech-startup (aka pisses off left subs) while the Libertarian Party is rather (in)famous for bending over backwards towards the ""socially liberal"" aspect of libertarian (pisses of right subs). The libertarian movement also straddles a difficult line between moderate reformists who just join other parties/movements (localists, the liberty wing of the GOP, etc) & extreme radicals who obsess over theory and divide themselves over minor disagreements (AnCaps, Objectivists, the origins of ""Somalia lulz"" jokes). Finally, and perhaps the biggest political hurdle, embracing libertarian thought in a meaningful way implies that 1) things are bad enough to require significant change from the post-Wilsonian/FDR/LBJ norm... but 2) not so bad that we need any kind of gov't intervention."
