1. Take it out slow, leave your ego at the door

4. Be consistent"

confidence,fco1wsg,t1_fco0ede,1577822579.0,"This is hard, I‚Äôm not going to lie. So first you have to reinvent yourself head to toe...although everyone has a certain expectation you (good or bad) when you reinvent yourself (your new look is very important) it will force people to see you differently, literally. People will take notice just out of the sheer difference alone. Now they might still treat you the same but if you act differently, are more upfront and outgoing, some of them
 will start to change their opinion of you. (Watch the Devil Wears Prada for an example of this)

But at the same time, try to meet new people with your reinvented look and attitude. They will only now know you from this new perspective.

Does that help?"

confidence,fcnwclq,t1_fcnvbxs,1577819756.0,"I see...so the first thing is to go back and revisit those thoughts and see how it actually played out. Almost all situations are built to be more scarier in our heads than in real life. Once you‚Äôve come to terms with the fact that maybe it wasn‚Äôt so bad and the fear was the only thing holding you back you can now be liberated to be the optimistic open minded outgoing fun loving person you always were. But you have to be honest and overcome that fear first, it‚Äôs bullshit I promise you. 

Also, the best way to overcome fear is to face it head on...at first it will be scary so don‚Äôt hesitate (let your mind talk you out of it)...just go straight for it without thinking 

Let me know how it goes"
