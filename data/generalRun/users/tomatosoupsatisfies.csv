politics,ffihulv,t1_ffhgrc3,1579974229.0,"Meh, I became conservative 25 years ago mainly due to the importance of fiscal responsibility. Trump is no conservative in that regard. I also became conservative because of liberals’ false narrative, actively pushed by the obviously biased media, that government is the most important source of happiness. I also became conservative due to liberals advocating destructive policies merely for sake of masturbatory sanctimony."
