It sank into the swamp. So I built a second one. And that one sank into the swamp. So I built a third. That burned down, fell over, and then sank into the swamp. But the fourth one stayed up. And that’s what you’re going to get, Son, the strongest castle in all of England.*"

It would not have been awful at all to leave out a lot of that stuff if it meant polishing the core of what is a pretty good game."
kakarot,ffopu72,t1_ffo28cq,1580080304.0,This 100%. Most of the features of the game don't even get used because after you spend all your time upgrading one character they fuck off for a full chapter.

Also the fact that half the time you can't even use the party feature because of arbitrary story limitations. Seems like a weird design decision to include it but make it usable so rarely. Before the androids show up the only person who should really be off limits for me to party up with is Vegeta, otherwise why can't Goku fuck around and get the Dragonballs with Gohan and Piccolo instead of being alone?"
