Keep clubs sterile man, I wanna be in and out not talk with a bunch of friendless stoners who lagg. Sounds good on paper but wait til you walk into 20 stoned assholes who won't leave and move slow and you'll hate it too.

Easy for me here in California to judge but I would do that if it was my only option to provide. When you love people, you provide for them. Nice to see China didn't do anything bad to the folks but rather have them an option to collect and sell directly to govt."
