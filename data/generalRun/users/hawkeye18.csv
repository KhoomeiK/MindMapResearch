As to replacement parts, a shocking amount of it is *still in use today* so it's easier to get basic stuff than you'd think. Otherwise, we salvage parts from areas of the ship that aren't open to the public. And hope we don't have to open them up before I leave lol"

The efficacy of multivitamins is... debated, to say the least, but at least none of the documentation says it hurts any, and if nothing else there is the placebo effect.

I would also recommend he take some headache medicine (I find Excedrin works great); even if he doesn't get headaches, those around him will and anything you can do to hook up those around you is a favor you can call in later. Not a big one, but still."

I tried very hard to be the ""technical Chief"" and was told in no uncertain terms that that was neither needed nor desired. I nearly got counseled for going out to a plane to show my ATs how to use a TDR! 

The best I can do is try to instill in my Sailors the importance of a solid systems & theory foundation, and hope they can carry that attitude to the next generation of Chiefs, because lemme tell you buddy all this one cares about is programs & policies. I know very few brothers and sisters that are worth a duck in their rate, even if they are good Chiefs."

Fuckin' zilch, boyo.

I don't know if you took the I or the O test - I've been both - but as a Chief your job is either to run a workcenter or run a maintenance/PC desk. Neither of these jobs requires or particularly covets electronics skills.

The reality is that the test isn't about what you do know as a First, it's about what you *should* know as a Chief. And what you should know is programs, policies, and procedures. That's why supply, QA, maintenance control and maintenance admin made up the first 117 questions of your exam!"
