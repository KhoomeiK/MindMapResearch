GetMotivated,fcqffwe,t1_fcpxbfh,1577884990.0,"Well... I’m 18 years old and she is like 16-17 years old, in our young days, we used to have fun but when puberty came, we are completely changed, we are barely talking together now. But her personality has stayed, she is very friendly and awesome, while I was used to be confident but now very shy person. By the way, I had surgery recently, and she was the first female person that messaged me to know if I’m doing well. And she was caring me even that since. After vacation, we are doing great but we are always in distance. We are not being awkward. 
The problem it’s me, she has many (male friend) and she hugs some of my friends ( bot sure if it’s in love way ) and I keep wondering what will happens to her if I tell her something like out of blue..."
Crush,fcotgq6,t3_ei7b84,1577841095.0,"I would say he really likes you but I’m not sure if it is in friend way or love way.
“Friendzone” doesn’t exist. Why?
Because, let’s take an example: 

Boy (A), imagine you like him and you want to seduce him. You compliment him, flirting and asking out, right?

Boy (B), imagine you like him, friendly, you want to be friend with him. You don’t compliment and you don’t ambiguous like a friend, right?
Now, the boy you are talking, have you been him like the boy A or B?

I’m just telling you this, and you can compliment him! You can tell him that he is very muscular. And from step by step, he would like/love you.
GOOD luck"
Crush,fcosfk3,t3_ei6gmi,1577840301.0,"I prefer cute but with good personality. Because I feel like “Sexy” is like a way to seduce men or something like that. I’m not saying it’s bad or good, just my opinion, they are both good anyway. What is matter is the soul or inside of the heart.
There is someone I like, she is sexy with makeup and cute without makeup and she has amazing personalities! She is very friendly but I’m too shy to tell her that I love"

If Malk dash on you, you stand in front of this behemoth, and dash and light attack. It’s not that hard if you are alone. 
But if you are in team, then maybe Malk will dash on someone else. So, you have to dash (like you said 3-4 times), you have to move fast and try to interrupt with CB. (Sorry, English is not my first language)"
