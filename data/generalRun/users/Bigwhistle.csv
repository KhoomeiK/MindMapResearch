todayilearned,fdql0ty,t3_emr4e7,1578669214.0,"To be clear, the surgeons relieved a pneumothorax (PTX), but, it is unclear whether or not this women had a tension PTX, which is a true emergency, and in most cases, a life threatening situation. Sounds like she had a stable PTX, and they were concerned that pressure changes in the cabin could convert it into a tension PTX. Definition of tension PTX - a persistent air leak from the lung into the pleural cavity, increasing extra pulmonary volume, while collapsing the lung as the volume of extra pulmonary air increases. The condition can become so severe that it begins to push the heart and great vessels across the midline (known as mediastinal shift), and compromise blood flow, affecting blood pressure.
