ecobee,ffgj7bt,t1_ffg7ome,1579907472.0,"Correct I think Ecobee is ""smart"" in the sense that it can be remotely controlled. Otherwise, I think it has very limited learning capacity. I believe there are actual smart thermostats in regards to hvac management bu they tend to be specific to furnace brands and mostly for variable stage ones.

In my case mine is connected to my Samsung Smartthings account so I can control it more granular. For example, I know that in summer I need more circulation for sure and in really cold weather I want less so I set the min fan run time accordingly with rules in Smarttings."
ecobee,ffg3g5j,t3_etfml6,1579897628.0,"no, it doesn't do that. I am guessing it is likely because the circulation fan doesn't actually help in many cases. Usually, such a big mismatch in temps occurs due to return air issues and just using the same return air only helps after a long run time if at all, when you factor in the heat loss/gain you get by vents in attic, crawlspace etc. Even when they are insulated, they will lose or gain heat a bit."

Time and time again we see people voting against (either directly or by not voting) policies that would help climate but would have some cost associated with it.

Sorry but this change has to happen bottom up, it won't happen effectively in the other direction in a modern democratic country."
science,fej2fxh,t1_feij3ud,1579154409.0,"Why is it weird? I started to do take out boxes a lot more frequently at restaurants nowadays due to stupid portions. Once you learn reasonable portion sizes you can actually get 3 servings out of most restaurant food. Obviously I am talking about food you can portion easily.

Given above, portiniong meals cooked at home is a no brainer."
business,fej0y5b,t1_feiwct4,1579152981.0,"and why do you think those businesses exist? Why do you think they try to cut costs in every possible case? 

It is correct in case of a monopoly, businesses will increase prices without increasing quality or spending more on production to minimize carbon emission but when they are not a monopoly they have no choice to adjust to customer demand. If customers want cheap products regardless of how they are built, that's what businesses will do."
business,feirgdb,t1_feiofya,1579145340.0,"They are saving way more than few hours. If you are going to make a claim, make sure to understand the situation first. There are a fair amount of articles out there that explains why companies use private jets.

Also even if they didn't the reduction in carbon footprint would be insignificant compared the footprint due to consumer consumption. Simple example is people buying food out of season or out of region or just the sheer stupidness of portion sizes in US where most of it goes to waste."
technology,feillrh,t1_feiki6k,1579141392.0,"Depending on how you are doing it, all you are doing is providing a false sense of privacy? If you are providing public info, then it doesn't matter if you let them hide the info through your app, it is still out there."
business,feikzt6,t1_feihens,1579140975.0,"they would still take the flights and that's OK since in the grand scheme of things these flights don't matter. 

Unfortunately, the problem is us, consumers. As long as we want cheap things to buy, climate crisis will always be at the back seat. The same reason is carbon tax will likely not happen in US anytime soon either, majority wouldn't vote for it."

EmpiresAndPuzzles,feic59j,t3_ep8rbh,1579135057.0,"The only times I got good loot from titan were the times I had worse scores than usual (loot tiers 10-12). I never got a 4* ascension item from higher tier loots so far. 

Similarly, I got a few 4* ascension mats from mystic vision but nothing from chests for a while."

Issaquah,fegwlyv,t1_feffah6,1579104162.0,It was really bad for a brief time range around noon where it snowed really heavy and plowers weren't out. By 1-2pm everything was much better.
entertainment,fegu5xc,t1_fegtilf,1579102605.0,They can lobby but ultimately it is the vote that counts and 70% of us keep saying they are OK with such policies.
entertainment,fegu2ht,t3_ep15xl,1579102544.0,"So all legal and cool, and exactly what we want companies to do based on how we vote. (roughly 70% eligible voters agree with these policies or don't mind them based on their actual vote or bring absent)"
SeattleWA,fef348w,t3_eotwt4,1579047051.0,He must have written this post in a great hurry. Half of the sentences don't make any sense given context. I assume he meant to say roads are near frozen temps and not the opposite.
bestof,fedofdc,t1_fecvd9j,1579016396.0,"Yes, but a smart person would look at the content of the lists and realize the difference glaring at you.

Some one who is not smart would just say, hey look they have a list as well, so both parties are same."
xboxone,fed0b45,t1_fecq2mj,1578992278.0,"Are you sure about that? Many newer cars have subscription services now for some features, TVs have a similar hidden cost when you consider online ads shown for its services.

Pretty much everything is going towards subscription model today as it makes more sense for developers."
