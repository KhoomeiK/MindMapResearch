Theirs heaps of them on wish and dhgate aswell if you want something even cheaper, but shipping could take a while."
FreeSpeech,ffpe0fk,t1_ffo4uzy,1580092692.0,"That's a statement not an explanation. Try again.

You also haven't answered any of my previous questions. If you don't want to open your mind to other possibilities beyond your worldview just say so.

PS: China isn't a free country, it never was and likely never will be."
airsoft,ffpdn41,t3_eugqu7,1580092426.0,"Try the speedsoft sub. What you're looking for is a blade trigger and most people, myself included, think it's cancerous. Alot of fields don't allow that style of trigger aswell so you may well be limiting the areas where you're able to play while pursuing this upgrade."
FreeSpeech,ffm6sje,t1_ffjdjj4,1580049493.0,"Okay you've just shifted your position, first you said fear mongering is good and now you're saying what is mistakenly being called fear mongering is good because it actually isn't fear mongering. Which is it? Stand your ground and be precise.

I also called out the MSM for fear mongering, not these individuals who were supposedly arrested. As for the quarantined areas, that's standard procedure and has absolutely nothing to do with censorship, as I've said many times before, and the same steps would be taken in the US and Europe. And they absolutely should be because how else do you contain an outbreak?."
LouderWithCrowder,ffiswwe,t3_eti2r3,1579981903.0,"Jeffrey Epstein, his name is Jeffrey Epstein and yes he did not kill himself. ""*You know who*"" is the CIA *whistleblower* and the lying sack of shit is still alive."
airsoftcirclejerk,ffhd78c,t1_ffhcv7p,1579930559.0,"Tbf it's a fairly simple concept, put the tool required into the slot, turn 90° and then remove. If you have to email someone about it god help you."
FreeSpeech,ffhc2mk,t1_ffhbq2p,1579929435.0,"First of all fear mongering is two words not one, secondly how is quarantine not a measure of preparedness? Least of all when dealing with a whole new virus?

My main issue with you is that you're elevating fear mongering above freedom of speech. Fear mongering can be used as a tool to suppress and control and as such I don't see how you can do that while being a proponent of free speech."
airsoftcirclejerk,ffhb6ti,t3_etmewy,1579928565.0,If a QC spring guide takes your eye out you deserve it for putting your eye directly in the line of fire. It can only go in a singular direction.
