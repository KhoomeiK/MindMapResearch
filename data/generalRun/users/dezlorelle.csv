newzealand,fco6ca5,t1_fcmd5tv,1577824920.0,"Because they code share. It’s the way you can book on both with one fare. Their computers, as old as they are, link with code sharing. If you booked a return (say 4 legs total: 2 there and 2 back) and didn’t fly leg #2, legs 3 and 4 will be cancelled as if you never booked them. If you book 2 flights there on one booking and 2 flights back on another booking, and skip out on leg #2, you return flights would be safe. But all on the same itinerary, and anything booked after you fail to get on a flight will be cancelled. 

I work for a major airline."
