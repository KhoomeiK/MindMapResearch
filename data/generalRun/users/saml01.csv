You’ll note that this is just the tax breaks on the hotel, retail, and office space part of the complex. The arena itself, it’s previously been reported, will pay a “guaranteed minimum annual payment” of $1 million, based in some unexplained way on ticket sales, and escalating each year, again by an unexplained percentage.


Tax breaks are simply taxes not collected, not money given. If they don't build the arena we don't suddenly have 27 mil in cash. Instead we have an arena with jobs and stores, hotels and all that generates taxes (not prop, but sales) and ticket sales.

IMHO. 27.6 mil over 20 years is nothing. The Amazon deal, which was amazeballs btw, had a whole lot more in tax breaks but in return they had to build a school amongst a whole lot of other requirements to get all of them."
