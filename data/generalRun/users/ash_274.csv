nottheonion,ffs2h41,t1_ffrf2qk,1580171506.0,"IANALawyer, but I think the party being sued would be able to consolidate the cases into one jurisdiction, if they were all filed about the same time.  I believe the suing party has to show how *they* were located in each different state at the time of the ""defamatory"" post.  Plus, they would still have to serve notice to the person they're suing wherever that person is.

If I wanted to sue my neighbor, I couldn't drive a few states away and file the suit there.  If we're both in New York I can't fly to Colorado to sue because the Colorado court would call me a stupid moron.  Even if they *did* accept it, both my neighbor and I would have to travel to Colorado to be in court (so, sucks for *me*, too).  The neighbor could also make a motion to transfer the suit back to New York and the Colorado judge would probably grant it and call me a moron again.

Now, the next question may be: If I'm classified as a vexatious litigant, what's stopping me from going to (or moving to) another state and suing there?  If I'm suing the same person, *they* would have a copy of the papers that state I'm a vexations litigant and they could show that to the court in the new state and that judge would be *pissed* I was trying to get around the system.  If I moved and was suing someone that didn't know I had been restricted, chances are they/their lawyer would find out and I'd be facing a pissed judge again that could dismiss the case on those grounds alone."
