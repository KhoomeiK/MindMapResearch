childfree,ffdeocr,t1_ffdcbwi,1579819290.0,I have NEVER thought of this and it’s 1000% true.
FoodAllergies,ffakjk5,t3_esj2v4,1579738037.0,I’m so sorry!  It’s so frustrating. Every damn meal is like doing advanced trigonometry trying to figure out what to eat and whether it’ll set you off. It’s taken the joy right out of eating.
stopdrinking,feyf332,t1_fewqt01,1579444640.0,"I am going through a break up right now, and not drinking. I’m right there with you. The pain coming in waves...me too. You are not alone! And yes, Reddit has been comforting. Thank you, kind strangers. Thinking of you. Positive vibes and thoughts."

relationship_advice,fexji3v,t3_equvi4,1579431997.0,"I am right there with you!! I haven’t moved in with my boyfriend yet because of a myriad of issues that I thought we were moving forward from. Earlier this week he lost it and broke up with me, saying he’s “tired of my shit” (basically, who I am as a person.) Meanwhile, there’s shit he does that I’m tired of too but in my eyes it’s stuff we can work through...or is it? I’m very confused right now too. I love him and it physically hurts me to be broken up, yet I know maybe splitting up is the right thing to do. I wish I had a clear answer for you, but I will give you this: trust your gut. The fact that you are even asking these questions means you are having legit doubts. 

Plus - he gets mad at your messy areas but doesn’t even know how to and doesn’t clean?! That’s some bullshit right there. So you’re going to have to be on edge all the time about your stuff AND be the only one who cleans the joint?! You’ll be resentful for sure, if you’re not already. Think about that. 

Good luck. It’s so hard. I’m thinking of you."
stopdrinking,fersf9e,t3_eqfdvb,1579357839.0,"Last Sunday my boyfriend and I decided to do 30 days of no drinking together. I’ve since been dumped by said boyfriend, on top of having one of the worst work weeks of my life. I drank Thursday night and last night. But not today! I reset my first 30 days today. IWNDWYT."
