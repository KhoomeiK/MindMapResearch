Teachers,fdvk2h7,t3_emsgxd,1578748239.0,"I used to ASSUME that kids these days would have a mastery of what we consider basic technology skills, but after I discovered how wrong I was, I did a little reflecting and realized no one (with any authority on the matter) was actually saying it.   


Kids are good at play. They’re wired to figure out ways to play with whatever you throw at them. I was in high school 15 years ago, and back then, “play” with computers involved figuring out how they work, and how to find and use the limited tools at our disposal. Computing has changed a lot since then. Interfaces are a lot more intuitive, and for mobile devices in particular, it’s virtually impossible to peak “under the hood”. Many of the basic functions we consider to be part of standard computer skills are buried under many more layers of abstraction.  


There's also a possibility that our ideas about what computing skills are standard is getting outdated. I needed to learn how to save a file, retrieve it, and attach it to an email because it was literally the only way to get a file from computer to another via the internet. There was no such thing as a ""cameraphone"", which are so standard that we just call them ""phones"" at this point. Kids can take a picture of a document and send it in a text. I'm not saying that email attachments are an outdated skill because of text messaging, but it's certainly something to be cognizant about."

gallifrey,fdvd8og,t1_fdmxlnt,1578746242.0,"I think she's been characterizing well, it just may be difficult to recognize because it's different than what we've come to expect. The Doctor is usually characterized as having an other-worldly level of wisdom and experience. They're not usually awe-struck by new things; they tend to regard them with skepticism and concern. 9-12 have all had scenes where they stand back and look at something with a frown while everyone else looks at it with excitement and wonder. It's supposed to reflect a millenium of experience, but what if the emotional response to that experience isn't retained between regenerations?   


13 is the answer to that question. She looks at everything like a kid in a candy shop. Wide-eyed wonder. Truly an explorer, with an explorers spirit. It's not like she doesn't know the same things that past doctors knew. It's that she's optimistic about them. I don't mind the reprieve from a cynical doctor.  


Perhaps she seems too naive to be a millenium-old explorer. I think they're pushing this direction for a reason, though. With the looming information about timelord history, they may be setting her up as an optimist just to make the secret of the timeless child all the more crushing when it's revealed. When that happens, we could see a pretty substantial personality shift."
gallifrey,fdvazz4,t1_fdn0cv6,1578745451.0,"I described it in my response to this question as the ""kid in a candy shop"" look. Everything is new and amazing, which is a fair interpretation of what timelord regeneration means. What's the difference between knowledge, wisdom, and experience? Which of those are things that a timelord retains through regeneration?  


Capaldi's regeneration hinted at this as well. He would say things to the effect of ""I've seen it before, but not through *these* eyes"". That kind of statement carries a lot of weight, but it's ambiguous and subject to interpretation. I think 13's responses to new things is one such interpretation."
Coffee,fdv9l0h,t1_fdtpj5v,1578744982.0,"Like the other guy said, it's likely too coarse. That happens to me with shitty coffee. I get better results from letting the coffee steep longer. You probably still won't get a perfect puck shape, but it will hopefully be better than the sludge you described. For sure use the inverted method, if you aren't already. That way you can control how long it steeps. Try giving it about a minute of steep time, and stir frequently.

[Here's a video on the inverted method.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1B55ba-kLA) You can skip the first 30 seconds. I personally find that it's not necessary to flip the whole thing with the cup.

Seriously, she looks at everything with wide-eyed wonder, which is fair because it’s often something wild. But to me that distinguishes her the most from her predecessors. 9 and 10 had it to an extent, but it was only an occasional thing. For 13, it’s all the time. Everything is amazing.

In the past, the doctor would often look at a new thing with a frown, suggesting he was either skeptical that it was good, or that he already knew something we didn’t that was bad about it. There was a sense of wisdom in that look, but also pessimism.

13 is youthful and potentially naive optimism through and through."
