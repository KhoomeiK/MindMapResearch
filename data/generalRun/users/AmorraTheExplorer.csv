BPD,fgeajmx,t1_fg9vift,1580695138.0,It's very strange. At one point in my life I was super turned on by a naked woman in porn. But no part of me would ever want a relationship with one. lol
BPD,fg8lvsk,t3_exi363,1580623748.0,"BPD has definitely made me confused about my sexuality. At one point I was extremely sexually attracted to women, but not romantically. Only men. But I am no longer sexually attracted to women. 

On the note of leaving your man for a girl.. No matter your sexuality, we have a choice to control our thoughts. It's not my choice whether I find someone attractive but it is my choice to dwell on those thoughts so much / fantasize about them to the point where I would actually consider leaving my SO for them. If carnal lust in your relationship is really important to you then maybe it is a good idea to just break up and look for a relationship with a woman. But if not, then I'd enjoy the relationship you have now and the love you share and don't pay too much mind to anything else."

BPD,fg51udz,t3_ewrpno,1580516222.0,"It is possible for things to get better, but you would have to really work on yourself and your identity and not attaching it to people so much. You're dependent on people, it's why you had so many at once at one point. Instead of self soothing, you rely on them. If you don't think you can get better in time to avoid hurting him, then I do believe it best that you leave and STAY SINGLE until you learn to have healthy attachments to people, where you don't need them all the time to feel okay."

BPD,fftivr0,t1_fftck6x,1580221724.0,This. I'm actually in therapy right now specifically working on assertiveness. I have gotten myself in so many situations I didn't want to be in because I simply couldn't say No.
BPD,ffrrgr8,t3_euo1u9,1580164181.0,"There are many skills I've learned in therapy to deal with this. Dr. Daniel Fox has a new video out on youtube about Paranoia. It is very helpful. 

Figure out what your body feels like when you start to feel this way. That way you can spot it in the future and stop yourself before you react. Don't allow your brain to go down that rabbit hole. Check the facts. 

Example: I'm scared he is cheating on me. 

Facts supporting this fear: He didn't answer his phone when I called him.

Facts against this fear: He usually always answers. He loves me. He's never done me wrong before. He said his phone was on silent. 

How do you feel now that you've examined the evidence: Calmer.

Allow yourself to think about what you would do if he did in fact cheat. What would your risk plan be? :  I would have family, friends, my job, church, therapy, hobbies, children, etc to get me through it.

Do some breathing when you've caught yourself getting upset. Journal about your worries if you can. Or tell a trusted friend about them and they will usually explain in a kind way that it is an irrational thought.

Do an opposite action. When you're feeling jealous, instead of checking his phone or social media or whatever you normally do, do the opposite. Fire your investigator. Remind yourself that Love believes the best, hopes for the best. Hold his hand despite your desire to problem rip his arm off. etc."
BPD,ffrqdiy,t3_eur0kx,1580163492.0,Look up Dependent Personality Disorder. Maybe you have it as a comorbidity. I do.

BPD,ffjk1zl,t3_etzesg,1579999999.0,"In DBT there is a section about your ""higher power"". So it can definitely be incorporated. I will say, the times I've been closest to God are the times I've had the least symptoms. I was apart of bible studies and surrounding myself with Christian friends and in my bible every day."

BPD,ff7kcrz,t3_es0bf7,1579651600.0,I agree with the other comments and to also add that you need to ask yourself if you're giving too much of yourself by putting others needs above your own. Are you disrespecting yourself? Are you stretching yourself too thin? Are you even comfortable doing that? I know naturally we think other's needs are more important than our own but if we challenge that thought process sometimes we can gain some self respect.

BPD,ff44ska,t3_ereaxj,1579555537.0,"This is your subconscious way of feeling in control of the situation. You feel out of control when he goes to be with this girl, so you take control back by (almost) cheating. It's a way to avoid hurt. This sort of thing can become a cycle in your relationships. In times where you start feeling scared and out of control, you will get this desire again. If you're aware of it though, you can address it and stop it. And you caught yourself doing this! Hurray! Now next time you'll be able to see it coming and do something else instead. You'll be able to remind yourself that it is your self destructive protective system trying to avoid abandonment. 

Side note: Speak up next time you feel uncomfortable about something. He may feel your comfort is more important than doing the thing he wants to do. And then you won't have to deal with this at all :)"

BPD,ff1wesv,t1_ff1w6cu,1579487707.0,I think it's perfectly okay to ask for extra attention on those days. Just make sure you assert yourself before you get emotional about it and I'm sure he wouldn't mind!
BPD,ff199wv,t3_er2um2,1579476456.0,"I've been in this exact spot. But I really believe the answer is C. My husband doesn't play as much as he used to which has helped but the main thing that helps is finding your own thing to do near me. Now I play video games beside him (not the same guy), or I'll read a book while he games. It's reasonable of him to want that time. He sounds like a great guy. Don't push away a good thing :)"

BPD,fezr8p9,t3_eqw2f4,1579460634.0,"So what it sounds like to me is the typical BPD push and pull. When someone is giving you loads of attention, you pull away in order to keep a safe level of intimacy. When he stops giving as much attention, you start chasing after him to keep that level of intimacy you desire but also fear. It's a never ending thing. I thought the same with my husband. He was obsessed with me in the beginning and I was like ""meh"". As soon as he stopped being obsessed with me, I was with him."

BorderlinePDisorder,felrbrz,t1_felqyzv,1579229037.0,I totally understand! But it's easier to be less emotional whenever you have the script already in your head and you know what you need to say.

BorderlinePDisorder,felqk8n,t1_felq1a4,1579228515.0,"It sounds like in this particular situation maybe it's best that you show up. But I think that a conversation needs to be had with your dad or both (if your mom does this too). Make sure to be assertive, not aggressive. A good template would be to use a DEARMAN script.

""Describe:
Use specific words to describe to the other person what you want, explaining yourself through language as clearly as possible.  Leave little question as to what it is that you want or need.  Practice clarity with your words.

Express:
Don’t shy away from being expressive.  Part of learning how to effectively communicate, while still being intentional and mindful, involves using facial expressions, tone of voice, or gestures that capture the content and importance of your request.  There is a delicate balance to be struck here.  Work towards finding the happy medium of being expressive while maintaining a sense of self-control.  This can be tricky for those of us who have a tendency to get lost in or overwhelmed by emotions.

Assert:
Work towards finding your own balance between asserting your needs and staying away from aggressiveness (this includes passive aggressiveness).  Be matter-of-fact as you assert your point(s).

Reinforce:
Be sure that the other person understands exactly why they should respond to your request.  Remind them of whatever positive outcomes would come from this request.  Other people want to feel good about complying with requests – not like they are being coerced into meeting demands.  Be careful not to offer rewards that are unrealistic or that you cannot come through on.  Be true to your word.

Stay Mindful:
Don’t allow distracting thoughts or intense emotions to cloud your thinking.  If the other person responds with defensiveness or hostility, don’t allow yourself to engage with the emotional intensity.  Stay on track with what it is that you are asking for.  If you respond to the other person with your own defensiveness or aggressiveness, your efforts will be sabotaged – you will probably not get what it is that you are asking for (at least not in the long-term).  Rather than responding with intensity, practice opposite action, radical acceptance, and mindful breathing.  Maintain your focus.

Appear Confident:
If you have trouble believing in the validity of your request, so will other people.  Imagine yourself as confident, competent, and deserving of what you want or need.  When you take yourself seriously, others are more likely to as well.  Practice self-validation on your own to cultivate this skill.

Negotiate:
When our ideal requests are not met, there is often a way to meet halfway – to find a solution that is “good enough” without compromising our values.  A big part of negotiation is about respecting other people’s limits.  It’s not just about you, after all.  When the other person believes that you are capable of negotiating, they are much more likely to see you as a reasonable person.  A positive consequence of this is that you are more likely to have successful interactions with this person in the future.  Win-win, right?""

Your needs matter. And you will continue to feel angry if you take other people's responsibilities onto your own shoulders."
BorderlinePDisorder,felporf,t1_felnae4,1579227909.0,"I might be misunderstanding. But from what I understand, you don't technically HAVE to do that for him, am i right? You can stand your ground and say ""No"" and stick to that. It definitely doesn't feel good when your boundaries and needs aren't taken into consideration. But there should be consequences for those actions."
BorderlinePDisorder,felitz3,t3_eprwpx,1579223212.0,"DBT has helped. Self awareness is huge. You need to learn how your body feels right before you begin to rage. Where can you feel it? Does your body tense up? Jaw clenched? Fists clenched? Do you feel hot? Can you feel it in your chest? Once you recognize those signs you can catch yourself before you explode. And you can separate yourself from the triggering situation and self soothe and / or distract. Do some breathing. I like to do one where I breathe in and tense up my whole body and hold it for 5 seconds and then I relax and breathe out. Journal about how you're feeling. Punch something. Take a cold shower or splash your face with cold water. 

Again, the key is to catch yourself BEFORE you let it all out."

BPD,feihyzp,t3_epblha,1579138960.0,It's your fear of abandonment getting kicked up. Also when we get attached we often feel our identity is in them so it's hard for us to be alone. It's a good idea to learn how to be okay and even HAPPY having alone time because healthy people often need time alone and we don't want to be sad every time our significant other needs space.

But I think what stopped my symptoms the MOST was the realization that I did in fact have BPD and it was causing me to see things through a distorted lens. I watch a lot of Dr. Daniel Fox videos as well and I've never seen anyone understand BPD better. I started to become more self aware of my own emotions and realizing that my reaction was not appropriate to the situation. Being in therapy every week has kept me grounded in the fact that I do this and so it's on my mind constantly. It also helps to be able to talk to someone ELSE about your feelings and they will usually help talk you down before you have an outburst at your family. 

Sometimes we get stuck in these ruts where we forget that we aren't seeing things rationally. But we BELIEVE we are. And in those times we have to get back to mindfulness and emotional regulation. I really suggest she try therapy again. And DBT groups sounds like an excellent option because you're surrounded by people who struggle too and you don't feel so alone. Hell, this thread makes me feel less alone and ashamed."

I know that must hurt to hear because it almost comes off as though it's the easy way out or how could someone choose leaving their family over getting treatment. That is how far in a hole she is mentally right now.. And you can't save her.. she's going to have to want to get out herself. She's being unfair right now. But all you can do is love her through it, try to validate her feelings without taking responsibility for her actions, and hope she really does get involved in therapy or MEDS again. Mood stabilisers are good for anger outbursts. You should maybe set some boundaries in place to protect yourself and the kids. That you won't stand there and take the brunt of her emotions. You won't enable her compulsive behavior. And a boundary to protect the kids."

I was projected my own self hatred onto him, believing that he thought I was a disgusting lazy good for nothing bitch. I was defensive before he could even speak a word. I don't even let people in my house because of this irrational feeling I have that it's disgusting. Which is weird because my house is in it's best state.

BPD,fdy19ya,t3_enak8a,1578775022.0,"Sounds like you're splitting. I have a very difficult time reassuring my husband when I've split on him. Even if it's not his fault I've split (logically I know that but emotionally it feels like he's done me wrong). But if you can I would try to tell him ""You haven't done anything wrong. We're okay."" and then take the space you need. But you 100% need to recognize that you are JUST splitting and in no way is it cause for you to go seek another man. And if this is something you continue to do, maybe just do him and yourself a favor and end things so you can work on yourself before getting into a new relationship."
