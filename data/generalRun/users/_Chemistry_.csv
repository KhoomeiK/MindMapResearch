Hoboken,fglr9ch,t3_ez16pe,1580908848.0,"I don't get why the city council & the city isn't teaching our residents what we already know from Donald Shoup. Councilman Russo asked these questions which are easily answered by Donald's book ""The High Cost Of Free Parking"":

Russo: ""The parking situation needs to be remedied and many people are either using a garage or calling for more garages to be built. I do believe that this will help without incentivizing more people to get a car.""

Answer: By mandating that developers build many spots of free parking to accompany all new developments — instead of letting demand determine how much parking is necessary — parking minimum requirements often end up wasting space on unnecessary empty lots and garages.

Bottom line is people are not going to use garages if you build them, as long as if parking on the street is cheaper. You build 500 parking garages and 50,000 parking spaces people will still try to park on the street because the garage parking costs too much for them. You MUST raise the cost of street parking.

Russo: ""We should look into balancing the budget by cutting spending."" ""We need to be transparent around what the additional funds will go towards.""

Answer: Cities must not just put new parking revenues into their general funds. ""We should use the revenue in a very visible, flamboyant way — so people can see the meter money at work locally, and know that it's doing good for them,"" he says.

In Ventura, for example, parking revenue has been used to pay for public wifi and new street lighting. Pasadena has used it for all sorts of infrastructure improvements that Shoup credits with revitalizing its downtown shopping area. ""In Pasadena, this has led people on a lot of streets to come out and say, 'we want meters,'"" Shoup says.

Russo: ""We should increase the costs more incrementally.""

Answer: Shoup doesn't address this, but we should simply base the costs of parking on supply and demand. I think Stevens students & Senior Citizens (residents over 65) shouldn't pay as much. I personally think if you own a car and want to park on the street you should pay $.50 per day for street parking. Yes, you should pay $182.50 per year.  

Russo: ""We need to increase the costs by a lot if we actually want to disincentivize cars.""

Answer: ""A recent study found that people who live in residences in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx that have minimum parking requirements are significantly more likely to drive to work in Manhattan (compared to others who live and work in the same areas). Another study found that among dense American cities, public transit use is significantly higher where parking is more expensive.""

Bottom Line: Use the increase in parking permits to create FREE Hoboken Hop Shuttles. Think about that. You tell people that now Hoboken Hop is 100% free with the increase in parking permits. That would be fair tradeoff and better than the feeling we are using this change to fix our budget issues.


Also to add:
""Modern technology makes this easier than you might imagine. Three years ago, the city of San Francisco installed sensors in the pavement of 256 blocks' parking spaces, in order to calculate the spots' occupancy rates and vary the pricing based on it. Every six months, they've adjusted the price of spots on each block, using wifi-connected meters. If more than 80 percent of the spots on a block are occupied in a given time slot, per hour parking prices go up 25 cents, and if less than 60 percent are, it goes down by 25 cents."" We need meters on every single street. The parking design should be simplified. If you are a resident, with a parking pass, you can park on any street, if it has a meter or not (except Washington Street which should be all-metered). If you are a visitor, you can park on any street, but must use the meter. The cost for meter parking is based by congestion and all meters have a WiFi connection, which would fluctuate pricing based upon congestion. The more dense streets, like Washington, should have HIGHER metered parking versus parking on Jackson Street."

Rarely do I see that in (most) suburban America. Don't get me wrong, there's lots of great places, but growing up in suburban PA, finding a good restaurant was often a hike. The food, bar or entertainment choices I have in Hoboken (and for that matter, NYC which is a 8 minute subway trip away to the West Village, or 20 minutes to midtown Manhattan) make it difficult to leave (especially when you are single and don't have kids)."
answers,ff5xg93,t3_ersybu,1579613455.0,"I live in Hoboken, NJ.

It is literally across the water from NYC. Super walkable town. It's only 1 square mile. People used to move here, meet someone and then leave for the suburbs to raise a family.

In the last 15-20 years that has all changed. People are now STAYING in Hoboken. They don't want to raise their family in the suburbs. While the city does have tradeoffs, it also has a lot of pluses:

* Quicker commute to work for NYC workers, giving families more time to spend with the kids. I have co-workers who take the train 90 minutes to get home each way. That's 3 hours of their lives just sitting on a train. My commute door-to-door is 30 minutes.
* A high concentration of great bars & restaurants, which are in walking distance of our home. Don't have to worry about drinking & driving. Also you get more quality than what is often in the suburbs with ""Olive Garden"" being the best it gets.
* Many people who can afford to live in the city send their kids to private or charter schools over public. That's the BIG trade-off. You can save a ton of money living in the suburbs and sending kids to a public school. 
* Some people love the outdoors & the quiet of the suburbs. I grew up in the suburbs until I was 21 and just remember how BORING it was. So bored. I lived in a beautiful home, with old trees surrounding it, lots of land...and was so bored. Once I moved to an urban area there was just no going back. 
* Also something to be said about living in a city and learning 'street smarts'. Cities can be a bit dangerous. You have to teach your kids at an early age about being aware of their surroundings. They grow up kind of quick. I think this also transcends into kids that learn how to be self sufficient vs kids from the suburbs who are a bit more coddled. I was lucky in my suburban experience to be a world traveler by the time I was 16 years old, but a lot of kids I see who move from the suburbs at 21 are clueless and gullible. 
* The suburbs offer a lower cost of living than the city. Like I wrote before a $400,000 condo in Hoboken gets you a 1 bedroom 700 square foot condo. If you want to have kids, that's probably a defining reason why you would want to move to the suburbs over the city. Problem is that I know a ton of people in well-paying jobs who aren't moving into the suburbs. They want to stay in the city for the reasons I listed above. I literally have a friend who works on Wall Street & his wife makes $125k a year as a nurse (manager level) and they are looking at a $2 million dollar home this week in Hoboken. They have a 3 year old daughter. Loves being in the city, will send their daughter to private school. 

So, I think one of the keys to your question is about what people can afford. I mean if you have enough money, a lot of people enjoy living in the city. As others have pointed out (like /u/88GrandWagoneer) there are many reasons why she wanted to live in the suburbs. I don't play loud music. That isn't important to me. Having parties and cookouts can happen in the city, just blasting music is a bit tough."
