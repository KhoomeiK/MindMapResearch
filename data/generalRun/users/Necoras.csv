You can make similar sounding arguments on both sides. *Yes*, you can be good and support Trump. *Yes* you can be good and support the right to abortions. People are complicated, with many facets. The only way to find out if the people you come into contact with are good or bad is to talk to them. See what they actually believe.

lampwork,fffjmmi,t3_etc25s,1579885380.0,"This isn't an especially complex piece of work. Depending on the size it could be done by hand, or on a lathe if it needs to be large. As others have said, any competent pipe maker should be able to do this. You'll definitely need a propane oxygen torch, and a kiln to anneal everything.

If you're wanting to start with an erlenmeyer flask, step one should be to attach [a point](http://www.lampworketc.com/forums/uploadedimages.php?viewid=254918) to the open top. This gives you something to blow on to control the internal pressure, and something to hold onto as you turn it. You'd then heat the bottom and slowly blow out the hole. Using a [graphite push](https://www.mountainglass.com/Blast-Shield-3-4-Premium-Graphite-Push-w-Aluminum-handle) you can shape the bottom inward to the slope you want. I'd connect the second flask at this point while everything's still symmetrical. Now the tricky part. You'll need to heat the spot where you want to attach the drain tube, blow out a hole, and then attach the new tube. At that point you can close off the point and use the drain tube to hold the piece. Pop the whole thing in a kiln and anneal.

You could also just start from scratch with some thick walled tubing and make the various flares and connections as required.

All of that said, it's not something that you can easily do without practice moving glass, and without a substantial setup (torch, kiln, tools, etc.) Just pulling good points takes a bit of practice. You need a rather large torch since as soon as you start making connections you need a large enough flame to keep the whole piece warm lest it shatter on you.

I'd find a local pipe maker and commission the piece. If it's all done in clear glass and it doesn't have to be made to exacting size specifications (which I assume it doesn't given that you're wanting to DIY it), it shouldn't be too expensive."

They live in animals where they are often much less serious. Ebola is in bats, where it's not lethal. But when people eat an infected bat, they get ebola and it spreads and kills. Smallpox likely hopped over from rodents. HIV came from primates.

Part of the reason that European settlers brought so many more diseases to the New World than vise versa (but the Native Americans gave Europeans syphilis, so that was a nice tit for tat) is because European cultures had much more contact with domesticated animals for much longer. It's not that the Natives Americans had no domesticated animals, but there were fewer varieties.

The reason these types of outbreaks start in China and Africa is because their food supplies often still have direct contact with wild animals. America's (and Europe) food supply is hardly immune from this of course. We see e. coli and salmonella outbreaks from time to time, but those are ubiquitous bacteria. They cause problems because of poor hygiene practices. And Mad Cow Disease was its own ball of wax that could have only come about in an industrialized farming environment.

Edit: I get it; the history of syphilis is complicated. Per Wikipedia:

> The origin of syphilis is disputed. Syphilis was present in the Americas before European contact, and it may have been carried from the Americas to Europe by the returning crewmen from Christopher Columbus's voyage to the Americas, or it may have existed in Europe previously but gone unrecognized until shortly after Columbus's return."
