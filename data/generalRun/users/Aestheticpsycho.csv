circlebroke2,ffestzt,t3_esjcfy,1579863879.0,"I've maintained that the only degenerates that exist are those who call others degenerates. It's pretty much just a word to punish and shame human sexuality, variety, and difference; it's a theologically rooted word to indicate that something defies the acceptable social order of things"

depression,ffa2jew,t3_esdf9n,1579726597.0,"I've had days/phases like this even without meds like that. I dont know everything about your condition, but I'd like you to have some hope that everything you're going through right now isnt permanent. Things can get better or at the very least change.

toptalent,ff7hf15,t1_ff64ul4,1579649615.0,That article is imperialist apologism and not much more. Billions live in shit conditions. Capitalism is as much to thank for our successes as inflatable dildos

PublicFreakout,ff45log,t1_ff3yvzw,1579556050.0,"It seems pretty lenient to me. Not condemning his actions, but legally he physically assaulted a minor (unless if he was 18) which I would expect a harsher sentence for in a different scenario"
toptalent,ff4563r,t1_ff44la0,1579555776.0,"That isnt context. Context is, as another person addressed, that smart phones are donated to the third world by charity organizations. Context is acknowledging that there is no logical way that capitalism is to thank for this. Context is to acknowledge that the state of the third world isnt some isolated event that happened in a vacuum that the west is simply helping address with its systems of economics, but rather a direct result of the interference of capitalist demand at the expense of foreign peoples, that is temporarily addressed by the goodwill of empathetic individuals and groups rather than systematically treated by the west"

LateStageCapitalism,ff3cwwa,t1_ff39taw,1579538635.0,"And if citizens attempt to organize against it online they're ostensibly put on a ""list"" that nobody really understands but everybody's afraid of.

ABoringDystopia,few0vqu,t1_fetzk3h,1579403886.0,"I assumed it was a thing, but I've almost never heard of bad dmt trips. I've heard only good things and wanted to do it, but now maybe not. Would you say your experience felt like is was a few days, about a week, longer? Could you tell the entire time or most of the time that you were tripping? That shit's scary because it makes you think, what if I'm just tripping right now."

ABoringDystopia,fesyyg1,t1_fesw4bb,1579370309.0,My guess is that this article is pure speculation based on pretty much nothing that can feasibly exist in the future. Its fear-mongering one of the most fundamental horrors of human consciousness to ensure obedience to the state
ABoringDystopia,fesyl0q,t1_fesnvcl,1579370186.0,"I get the sentiment, but I hate the trend of people applying dogmatic ego-based emotion to the operation of a government. It's understandable and imo right to use empathy and understanding first and foremost with geopolitical issues (immigration for example) but when your policy is dictated by anger, revenge, and resentment that falls into the toxic corrupted emotional states that shouldn't be used on a societal basis. I really think denying forgiveness to the worst of us hurts us all"
