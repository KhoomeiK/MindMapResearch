The (admittedly radical) left want us to recognise first the immutable characteristics of the person in front of us and to be sensitive to where they, and we, stand in the oppression olympics in order to ensure we act in order to offset the power balance.  For example, I as a white person when speaking to a black person must recognise that this person is black and therefore is beset by historical oppression and I must assume they occupy a lower station than me socially due to oppression, and also defer to them so as not to perpetuate racist actions as a white person ie check my privilege.  While on the surface this may seem pretty straightforward matter of respect, however the broader meaning of this is that this means that I am to treat this person not as an individual but as a representative of his identity.  That's pretty fucking racist.

ie the left says we cannot be equal due to perceived historical oppression, and when we engage with anyone we must recognise this first and foremost by acknowledging the group identity of person we are engaging with.  This above all else.  Normal people should not give a shit and engage on the basis of what this person brings to the engagement.  Which is the more bigoted approach?"

It is a great deal when your survival while pregnant and nursing/caring for children is largely dependent on others around you, and that both also carry huge risks to yourself, so you securing protection and secure food supply is fair exchange. for millenia 'freedom' was not aspired to as your literal survival depended on relationships.
