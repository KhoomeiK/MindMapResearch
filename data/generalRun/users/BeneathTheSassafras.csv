   Pony tail, bandana, hats are your friends. 
  12"" of curly hair can easily dry and rest looking like 5"" so do what keeps it healthy, experiment (but take notes, what you used, water temp, approx. Time rinse, the weather humidity, temp. ) switch to silk pillow cases, if you can, and stay on top of split ends. 
   Dont trust barbers/cosmotologists that dont have curly hair, they fuck shit up and still get paid, dealong with zero consequences. They literally dont learn shit (in my state and the 5 surrounding it, this is a Fact) 
  Kep yo split ends under control for the purpose of getting length. Once you can pony tail it, or cap it, you are golden as far as everday fuss. Take your vitamins, eat well. Once mine got past shoulder length 20"" ( wet) it wasnt too bad, and it stood out. Im B3 curly so its drastic.

  How does this go? ""Boohoo, the *other* gender invented playing games""   
   Srsly, he just answered the question. Alot of women, of any age, invite a guy back to their place, and instead of being to the point,secure, and upfront, will start doing the psychological roadblocks call Last Minute Resistance,  and Anti-slut-defence.  Many are not even conscious that this IS a game, so its the mans job to overcome it, via conversation, persuasion, push-pull technique.   
   Its really exhausting to have to read minds and take the reins Constantly, because a girl cant decide, and the entire onus and pressure to approach and seduce is placed on the man. Because of this, alot of guys walk out the BS game, because its BS. 
  So sometimes younger guys will hook up with an older lass because she makes her Indication of Interest quite direct. She chooses. Him. Thats whats refreshing about them. Mind you, this bears repeating; even if they are not conscious of a decision, and its subconcious, theyve still made a simple decison - are we fucking, or what?  
  Ive walked out of apartments after a date several times, and called some girls that arent a completely confused headache. The point is this- i respect myself and my time; a woman doesnt decide whether i fuck or not- I DO: so ill ring up a lass thats warmer, wants me, and knows what she wants. Instead of the telepathically fumbling in the dark for the perfect response key. If a woman still pulls that act after thirty, she will never be a good LTR because she cannot take responsibility for sex. Everything has to be a magical seduction ""it Just Happened!"" She tells her friend in her fun story. 
   Yeah, no thanks, im not walt disney. First off, just no pls. Secondly, i always have other options. And frankly, they are closer to 20 than 40. Its never worth the wait.
  
  Seriously,ppl, communicate with intention, or go without sex/ and or get old alone. Some people arent ashamed of what they want and can use their words to say it. 
  The burden of all approach and seduction doesnt have to fall on just one gender, thats what we call a doublestandard. And im not waiting around 5 dates for someone to get that. Life moves pretty fast, then one day you're old, and the phone rings alot less.
