First off; it’s not naughty any more, it’s not risqué, it’s not something that makes you cool. Once it became legal in a lot of states it lost its edge factor. 


Secondly: you probably bought the cheap back of the shelf shit that has been sitting there for six months or longer. Which means it’s stale as a dry leaf after summer, smells like someone’s dusty uncles couch, and smokes up like burnt dog biscuits.


Third: the way you cough after taking your dab or smoking your bowl reminds me of the way a pack a day ex biker coughs. It’s gross and phlegmy.

Or the person who makes minimal effort comments about  to your life (in person) and always steers the convo back to them. These “friends” keep you around because YOU feed their ego, YOU make yourself available for THEIR needs, and they aren’t concerned with who you actually are or what you’re actually experiencing. 

Note: this does NOT include the friend who, at times, does not or can not have a big response or respond at all to what you’ve said. Sometimes we get busy and merely don’t have the energy. You’ll know the difference."

And if it isn’t weird, to your wife, then I say the next time you guys stay the night, when you wake up, walk in to the kitchen buck ass naked. When your wife and MIL freak out just be like “oh, since MIL has a fetish for seeing me naked, I figured I would just cut to the chase”
