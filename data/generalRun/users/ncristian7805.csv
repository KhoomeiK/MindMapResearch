depression,ff2m74h,t3_er4unf,1579512839.0,"I agree 100%, back when i was younger, society was based on simpler stuff, trust was the best point of the society, there wasnt money to buy fake love or shit, there was much socialism, lots of talks and chating, no fake friends or anything of this, also i was more happier before. Now in future, i see people going deep down of financial statuses, breakups, divorces, coruption and anything you can imagine, you cant trust no one, no one cares about you, and you have to live by yourself everyday until your day comes. Wish society could come back at its best form, and everyone is equal."
