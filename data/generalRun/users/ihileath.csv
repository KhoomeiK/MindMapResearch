Ah, I should probably clarify something about my prior statements. I have absolutely no problem with this! What people use to represent them is entirely up to them, and I have maximum respect for that. I only take fault with the shitheads who think their opinions about female avatars are as important or more important than the actual female players. They've already got one avatar, after all, and ours shouldn't be designed with their sexual interests in mind. 

As far as school uniforms go, my main hatred for it comes from the idea of forcing men and women to wear different clothing. It reinforces a bunch of toxic ideas about gender, making it seem more important than it honestly is and maintaining the divide between both sides culturally. If a uniform with different forms (e.g. skirt or trousers) exists, the option to wear either uniform *must* be available for everyone. It's ridiculously problematic otherwise, and must be challenged. I have no fuckin clue how many times I got disciplined for breaking uniform rules, but I'm proud of each and every breach. If skirts mandatory at my school, I'd probably have been expelled! 

I'm also very much not fond of the above-boob window either. It just clearly serves no purpose other than what you described. Great example."
grandorder,fefr2f6,t1_feep5wx,1579062743.0,"Oh, they most definitely are *both* ridiculous to be called ""Arctic Region"" clothing, but one as you have pointed out is markedly more so than the other, which was why I was so baffled when the other daft person tried to use it as an example for their argument. I singled it out over the others because of that.

The Memorias I'm certainly not fond of either, but their faults lie in the Japanese traditional school uniform itself, so the blame for that falls less squarely on the artists in the game and more on societies like Japan's as a whole. I utterly despise gender-differentiated school uniforms, as I find them to be horribly archaic. And Atlas... yeah, I'm definitely not particularly fond of that either, but it's better than the bare legs in winter nonsense of the Arctic one. 

Of the others... I make somewhat of a distinction for Mystic Codes which are intentionally designed as casual wear, such as Anniversary Blonde, since there's far more room for acceptable deviation there. The most major fault I take with gender-based alteration is in designs which are intended to be practical and combat-based. A good design of that sort of clothing for a player avatar does not need to be excessively changed just because of the genitalia of the wearer. Shoehorning us female players into being more sexualised than their male equivalents is a major piss take. 

I don't mind minor alterations for flair, but don't automatically stick us in the ""Cute waifu"" role for practical gear - we want to look cool too damnit, and not all of us are okay with being comparably more revealing than the guys are. Leave that shit for the casual wear and the swimsuits. It just sorta sucks feeling like our avatars are being designed for the eyes of the male players, rather than the players they should actually represent. And given how trigger happy people are in with downvotes this thread about this sentiment of ours being raised, there are clearly a lot of entitled folk here who take affront with us having our own opinions about how we are represented.

To be honest, I suppose I'm rather more touchy about this stuff these days. Ever since the shitshow that was F!Byleth(FE Three Houses avatar), I've had far less patience for this nonsense. We should be moving *forwards,* not slipping backwards."
