Nootropics,ff9yijc,t1_ff9xgp4,1579724247.0,"I just started working out (lifting heavy not high intensity), mountain biking, and picked up rock climbing. I did do therapy as well for awhile. Rock climbing has been my god send really. It's structured and has structured goals. And just makes you want to train and better yourself. And then being in nature (hiking, rock climbing outside, mountain biking) away from all the bullshit that is causing your depression is a perk, like a mental reset. And breaking up with my ex, which was hard but she was fucking awful to me and it took 3 years for me to open my eyes. 

The book Unfuck Yourself really opened me up to change. It's no life changing book but the just of it is, if you're unhappy with something you can control, change it. Don't wait around for it to change. Which encouraged me to get out of the relationship instead of wasting anymore good years waiting for it to change.

In short, therapy first obviously. If you can't do that then I suggest just throwing yourself into things you love, hard. And be active with your body. Find something that works for you. Can't beat natural endorphins."
