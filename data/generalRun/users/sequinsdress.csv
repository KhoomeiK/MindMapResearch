selfimprovement,ffsus4f,t1_ffspno9,1580193285.0,"Nothing wrong with a low public profile. I’m not on many of my clients’ websites either. As a freelancer, I wouldn’t expect to be. (Nor do I want to be, lest it limit my horizons.)

So, here are things you can do (again, primarily using fact-checking and/or copy editing as your wedge):

—Reach out to marketing agencies, branding agencies, ad agencies, any digital communications agencies.

—Search the job sites to find the players in your region (see who’s looking for any kind of editor, content strategist, creative director etc not necessarily to apply for those kids, but to find potential companies to pitch your freelance services to)

—In your e-introduction, explain what you do, your unique skill set of fact-checking, editing and even copywriting, all under super tight deadlines, and name drop that your clients include x, y and z —if your core client isn’t a household name, mention it as a leader in its industry with $100m in annual sales

—include links to your work online and/or to your LinkedIn or website

—Work your contacts again. Email to say hi and ask your contact at the $100m company if they know of any other departments at said company that could use your expertise. And email those other contacts that fizzled out earlier to say hi, remind them what you do, and say you’d love to hear from them in the future. If there’s some newsy hook you can hang these emails from, that would be best, like, “hey, I saw this article [link] about your company/your industry/whatever and thought if our conversation last summer and wanted to check in,” etc. 

—Meanwhile, If you’ve got a writing niche or even a personal hobby (martial arts?) reach out to related magazines (consumer, trade) and pitch them story ideas you’d like to write for them. Check out Writers Market online if you’re not familiar with how to pitch a magazine. Start small—some magazines or websites may pay poorly or not at all—if that’s the case, use them strategically to build your portfolio of published clips. Just write for them a few times to gain experience and published clips that prove you’re also a magazine or web writer in this market, then bail. (Never keep writing for a low budget publication unless it’s truly a labour of love. If a venue only pays you $50 for a 1,000 word story, it’s not gonna get better. Even a 100% raise still nets you only $100–still too low. Use your clips to work your way up the ladder.)

So, basically, you’ve got three pokers in the fire:

—copywriting (branded content, marketing, etc)

—editing (fact-checking, copy editing — any editing)

—side hustle magazine and web writing (this is the semi-creative stuff that’s linked to your hobbies. Keeps you motivated and lets you write for pleasure, builds your clips, and can net you some extra cash or maybe free tickets to industry events and such)

The thing about this industry is, it’s hard work to break in. You’ve got to work and hustle hard to get some momentum going. You may not feel you’ve got some, but you do already, so keep pushing."
selfimprovement,ffsrun7,t1_ffsq2ew,1580190198.0,"It sounds like your pal has some issues (don’t we all, ha ha) but it’s great that you guys have common interests. There’s nothing wrong in expanding your social circle so you’ve got parent buddies to talk about dad stuff with without boring him or triggering his negativity."
selfimprovement,ffsrim6,t1_ffsq2ew,1580189879.0,"Yes, girls like fires and camping too! I mean, if that’s a specific girl’s personality. Just as not all boys enjoy those things. It depends on the individual kid so I’d start from a place of, “hell ya, who doesn’t like fires and camping,” and take it from there. I’m pretty sure most kids will love both, and camping can be made as tame or as wild as your family wants (or as your skill sets grow), from car camping or renting a yurt in a national park, to hiking, canoeing or snowshoeing into the backcountry."
selfimprovement,ffspllg,t1_ffptxiz,1580188091.0,"Reading this, I’m just gonna throw this out there... is it possible that your pal is just a dickhead and that he’s poisoning your self-esteem due to his own misanthropy? 

Being a parent is awesome if you make it awesome. I know babies suck (I didn’t really warm to mine til toddlerhood), but little kids are fascinating! Their lust for life is infectious! You’ve got to ignore all the bs about turning your kid into the typical boring cookie cutter consumer and just let them be themselves and go along for the ride. Explore nature. Camp. Check out art. Create art. Read together. Look at bugs. Build fires. Swim in lakes. 

The time you invest between babyhood and age 5 pays off down the line when you have a smart, fascinating kid/tween/teen. 

Kids are also great wingmen. You can meet other parents when your kids hang. I’ve cycled through various parent-friends over the years as my child has grown. None have become buddies for life, but I value those conversations, laughs and glasses of wine shared during what could otherwise have been lonely years (after my best friend abandoned me when I had a baby). 

Friendships you forge with other parents don’t have to last forever to be good or valuable. People move, kid friendships end, life changes, but being an involved and active parent exposes you to some interesting people with whom you can connect for the short or maybe even longer term."
selfimprovement,ffsnkd8,t1_ffpv4mr,1580186332.0,"Can so relate. I had my baby at 26–my best friend deserted me while I was suffering postpartum depression. Who wants to hang out watching movies while their best friend breastfeeds, when they could be put with their cooler, child-free friends, right?! 

The truth is it sucks to have kids when your friends do not. My former best friend didn’t have hers until age 35, around the same time as all her new friends. Now they all think parenthood is the coolest thing ever.  

You may lose some friends, which is why I think it’s good to do stuff with your kid and make new acquaintances (potential friends) who are at roughly the same life stage as you. 

I think making friends, much like meeting a romantic partner, is an issue of numbers. You’ve got to just talk, talk, talk to people—at daycare, at your kids’ lessons, at your running group. Most of these chats lead nowhere but they provide practice and a fun 30-minute conversation with a stranger after a 5K race is still a great interaction, even if you don’t ever see one another again. (And yet who knows—maybe you will make permanent buddies. If you’re already a runner or open to running, I’d suggest looking for a “run crew” in your area—they are more casual and fun-oriented with beer crawls and other social events.)

Ok, to your other point about content marketing, here’s some advice from someone who’s killing it (thank you for your kind words!):

1/ You know the ol’ Venn diagram with “Fast, cheap, good,” and how clients can pick two? Carve out a niche keeping that in mind. Clients reach out to me if they want something fast and really good. I won’t do cheap. But I’m the only writer I know who works weekends and will take on overnight assignments. 

I’ll never compete on price, but I’m always willing to stay up til the wee hours to deliver copy for first AM, so long as I’m netting a minimum of $1,000 for it. 

You could reach out to any new contacts mentioning you do fast turnarounds for a modest premium. 

I know for a fact that I’m not the first choice of one of my regular clients. This editor has a roster of writers they use for pieces where they have a two- or three-week lead. I NEVER get those assignments from this person. But I do get these panicked emails at 3 pm on a random weekday where they’ll ask if I could, say, ghostwrite two blogs for the next day, $1/word. I’m always available for those assignments. 

Also, every assignment I turn in hits the talking points, products and brand messaging the client wanted. I do NOT surprise them with any razzle dazzle—I do exactly what they wanted, well, and super fast. This also sets me apart. Here’s why...

My other hat is senior editor on a prestige CVB magazine, and working there gives me a lot of insight into the freelance “competition” I’m up against on some of my other gigs. What I see a lot of is entitlement, narcissism, poor research skills, messiness, and the infuriating tendency to try to wow me with something I didn’t ask for at the expense of something my client mandated we mention (for example, I say in my assignment letter that I need a specific historic deli mentioned, and then the writer instead subs in a hip pop-up food stand, because they felt it was so much cooler. But hello—the pop up will be shut by the time our magazine goes to print AND my client wants to see that historic deli in there because it’s tied to one of their other campaigns etc) You get the picture. 

Basically, if you put in the time to really deliver exactly what your client wants—well—you’re beating the competition. 

Add in fast turnaround, and you’re gonna become indispensable to your clients. 

2/ Remind your contacts who you are. All my regular and recent clients get holiday cards mailed to them. I wish them happy holidays, note that a holiday donation has been made to charity to thank all my awesome clients, and I include my business card and sign off by saying I hope we can work together again this coming year. I choose a charity that everyone can get onboard with like Elephant Nature Park or WWF, nothing controversial. This sets my card apart from any others they may receive, plus: oh! There’s my (cool looking!) business card sitting on their desk again! 

3/ Finally, if you’re not already hanging out your shingle as a fact-checker or copy editor, consider doing it. I’m neither of those things, but almost all my content marketing work comes via contacts I made coming up through the old print media ecosystem (magazine intern, progressing up the ladder to deputy editor) 20 years ago. 

That system barely exists anymore and I know it’s harder for millennials to benefit from that proving ground. 

But I also know that fact-checkers and copy editors remain in demand at better agencies (my CVB mag pays $30-36/hour for those tasks), so this can be a side route in. 

Take on some fact-checking and/or copy editing work, build relationships, and try to get your toe in as a writer that way. 

Apply for posted fact-checking or copy editing gigs, and reach out directly to agencies too. They may be more responsive because copywriters these days are truly a dime a dozen, while fact-checkers and copy eds are not. 

(These are distinct skill sets however. If you’re not qualified, consider a short night school course so you can you’ve got the formal training.)

Then....work those contacts!

4/ Two more things worth mentioning:
—Conventional wisdom says you need to use social media to brand yourself. I’m not out as me on IG, Twitter or anything other that good ol LI and FB. Use social if you want to, but don’t feel you need to. My work speaks for itself. If anything, positioning yourself as an influencer  or blogger just invites low-ball writing offers. 

—YOU CAN DO THIS!!! I’ve written for consumer magazines, national newspapers, the print and digital vehicles of Fortune 500 clients (I don’t work for them, I work through various agencies), and blogs (not my own, but as a guest blogger, for $). I’m not the smartest or most articulate writer, nor the smoothest conversationalist—definitely not the coolest or best looking at a media event—but I’m extremely competent, unfailingly upbeat about work, take criticism well, and FAST. That’s all is really takes to break from the pack once you catch a break (line up those fact-checking gigs and use them to segue into writing!).

YOU CAN DO THIS!"
selfimprovement,ffsggpk,t1_ffpxmi1,1580181117.0,"I hear you. I don’t feel the same way at all about content marketing (I get a lot of satisfaction from producing excellent content and seeing a gorgeous print package I contributed the words to, and also in working with people I like). But I am aware that all I’m doing, big picture, is selling crap to people. I get a sense of fulfillment through my volunteer work and charitable donations, not my work. This probably requires a willingness to compartmentalize. 

But it’s never too late to change careers! It’s funny—I was looking into becoming a cop a few years ago too, but I don’t think I have a strong enough gaze. I’m probably going to become a funeral director in a few years as the better content marketing gigs dry up. This isn’t a job I’d do for less money. I helped plan my mother’s funeral when I was 21, and I found it both cathartic and fascinating. I’m interested in helping people through a stressful time, while promoting greener funerals and burial alternatives. 

At 45, the idea of my “next act” excites me—I hope I can convey this to you (and OP), that the 30s are such a dynamic period of growth and opportunity."
selfimprovement,ffptdp6,t1_ffpjxzm,1580104995.0,"I think there are just as many people who did NOT rock their 20s, as there are people who did. 

30 is not old, and being a parent doesn’t prevent you from making new friends. Use that kid to help you open new social doors! Traveling with a youngster is great (I’m talking about cool places in Asia and Central America, not Disney). People are more likely to engage with travelers with kids. Close to home, join some play groups to meet more parents. You may not click with many (or any), but it helps pass time and you can practice your social skills. 

During the early years, my kid was the ultimate wing man! Not romantically—I’m happily married—but they really helped me make new friends and get out more."
selfimprovement,ffpsmsl,t3_euhybf,1580104225.0,"I’m 45 and fucking love life! Here’s all the stuff I started AFTER age 30–not to brag but to show it can be done by an average person (and upfront I’ll say: I’m middle class and have no parental assistance as a cushion, and my 20s were nothing great at all aside from having a kid at age 26):

-started running, built up to a marathon 
-started triathlon, built up to an Ironman
-started traveling, have been to about 15 countries with my partner and our kid
-learned to scuba dive
-got into snorkeling and free diving
-got into back country camping, bought a canoe to access remote sites
-earned my lifeguard certification
-volunteer coach with kids club

Every year, I find new things to get stoked about trying. If they don’t bring the fulfillment I’m after, I edit them out the following year. 

Here’s my advice to you, as someone who is about 15 years older, also parent to one child (now age 18), and also a writer/editor (been happily freelance for about 12 years now):

1/ Consider a move into content marketing. It pays better and more regularly. Make connections and build relationships at agencies. Cultivate a core client and groom additional ongoing clients. 

I write about crap like banking products and various consumer goods etc., but it enables me to clear $65K+ working part time from home so I have more time for the important stuff (my family, hobbies and travel). 

Bonus of working with agencies is you’ll meet new people on project teams. One may end up becoming a friend!

2/ Be an amazing parent! True, anyone can father a baby. But it takes an above average person to put in the work to truly be there for their kid. Becoming a parent is what spurred me on to my accomplishments after spending my 20s as a semi slacker. 

I got into running so I could keep up with my young child and chase them along the forest paths and in fields. (I used to be out of shape.)

I earned my lifeguard cert because my kid was taking swimming lessons and I hated the idea of them being a stronger swimmer than their parents—what a burden to put on a small child! I worried they might hesitate to call for help from  us if needed, because we were weaker swimmers.  We were also doing more adventure tourism and taking surfing lessons, as well as snorkeling etc, so I thought I’d better improve my swim skills to better supervise my kid. So, I spent time improving my fitness, my strokes, and attaining the prerequisites required to take my lifeguard course + exam. That was very humbling because I was mediocre compared to a lot of the stronger students—plus I was around 35 at the time while everyone else was around 17. But I did it! 

3/ Stop comparing yourself unfavorably with others! You’ve got to focus on your own goals and accomplishments. 

It’s never too late to start a sport. Will you make the Olympic team? No, but neither do 99.9% of the other people practicing the sport. 

Do a sport because it’s fun and it makes you feel badass. Join one with your kid! 

You’ll meet new people too! 

4/ Break down your big goals into smaller, more manageable goals and to-do lists. Maybe one for you for this week could include any of the following:
-check out a potential martial arts studio to take classes at 
-act out a picture book for your kid and make them laugh (I’m guessing your kid is a baby or toddler? Sorry if I have the age wrong)
-google “how to get into content marketing”
-brush up your cv/draft a cover letter

5/ Prioritize. I use my time wisely—including my chill out time in the bathtub like rn as I type this! I’ve cut toxic relatives out of my life, and because of this, every weekend is relaxed and breezy. I think a lot of people leave extended family interactions feeling down about themselves or others. I don’t bother, and as a result I’ve got like 75% less stress in my life. 

Good luck! 30 is not too old for anything. The world is out there, start exploring it one step at a time."

By comparison, the feelings became manageable if I hadn’t had caffeine that day. I now limit “real coffee” to those days when I’m working from home with no conference calls.

The self-discipline and confidence running introduced into my life (as well patience and joy) have played a huge role in my success as a freelance creative, partner and parent. I’m a happier, healthier and more self-confident person, and I take more (healthy) risks as a result. Running makes my life more interesting (I love planning race-cations, or just going for runs in different places when I travel). And, as a form of stress relief/therapy, running has gotten me through some dark times.

AnimalTextGifs,fdgzwyk,t1_fdgxoio,1578412331.0,"The shelters I’ve been to were clean, but I agree on the aggressive/fearful/loudly barking dogs. (Though old dogs actually offer pretty good value for most humans as they are lower energy and more chill, plus often trained.) It can be confusing to try to find a good match in those distraction conditions. 

We found a great dog by just telling the adoption coordinator our very specific needs, which were “potty-trained medium-to-large high-energy dog, good with cats, no aggression issues, to go trail running with”. No preference on sex, looks or age (aside from the running aspect). She immediately directed us to the two dogs in the shelter whom she felt fit the bill. One actually bit my kid during the meet and greet, which left just one option, whom we adopted. 

Saved us a lot of time and resulted in a good fit! We’ve been living with our dog for five years now. 

Likewise our rescue cats—I’ve always gone with a personality description, rather than looks, and tried to benefit from the personality insights of the adoption volunteers or any descriptions on the kennels or online."
