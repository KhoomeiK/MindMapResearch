She had everything you wanted for almost 15 years but he cheated and now she suffers. She had a career but 15 years out of the workforce killed that.

relationships,ffc56uy,t1_ffbyite,1579791790.0,"Depending how reasonable her mom is this could back fire because that's how I ended up with nothing. I, in her words was ungrateful and selfish for even bringing it up even though I didn't ask for more, I just told her how it made me feel. She cut me out of her life and will. I sometimes wonder if she didn't do that on purpose to set me up so I would be the bad guy. She also liked to drive a wedge between my sister and I and she may have been doing that but I'll never know."
AmItheAsshole,ffc4n8c,t1_ffc3i7y,1579791421.0,"That's also pretty dependent on exactly where they are, which we don't know. In some places the way they quit could disqualify them."

I am sorry and I don't think it's fair and even though, like you said, you weren't entitled to anything it still hurts to be treated like that. I was very bitter and angry and the only thing that helped me was therapy. I know that gets said a lot but it really was."

I'm not really attractive and we've had the same problem OP does. It used to really make him mad but then people would laugh at his anger and shit on me more. Now he does exactly this and it makes people so uncomfortable they usually stop. And my husband thinks I'm beautiful and he has my back so that's all that matters.
AmItheAsshole,ffbrqi3,t1_ffbqmg6,1579780179.0,"Yeah that's awesome, that's what we do for unshared too. I guess it just comes to how you learned growing up because both my sister and I do the clean while you cook and my husband and his mom always looked like they set off a bomb in there."
AmItheAsshole,ffbovwz,t1_ffbf4n4,1579776330.0,"This only works if you have the same cooking style. We had to implement a you cook you clean rule in our house. My husband uses every dish we own, doesn't clean anything along the way, and splatters food everywhere when he cooks. I'm a dish washer and counter wiper along the way type of cook. And since neither of us is going to change that we switched back the cleaning duties."

relationship_advice,ff98r1f,t1_ff98dwg,1579707452.0,No you don't understand. Its actually not ok for him to disrespect OP like that. And treating an adult like a child who can't take care of themselves is disrespectful.

He overreacted, got his ass beat, blamed it on her clothes, broke up with her and she's confused. She comes here for advice and do you see the comments here? Almost everyone is acting like women are little children who can't go anywhere alone and her ex was in the right for hitting someone. If you didn't mean to compare women with children maybe you shouldn't have quoted it."
relationship_advice,ff91oju,t1_ff9185w,1579702629.0,So men who get assaulted aren't adults? Because that's what you said about women in your last comment.

HumansBeingBros,fer2lqa,t1_feqq64f,1579348931.0,Imagine trying to offer some who insinuated they were a crappy parent some support because you did the same thing then getting called out for bragging and downvoted. Reddit is fickle.
