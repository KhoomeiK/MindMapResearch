After examining the products, he hadn't found an appropriately amazing vibrator and asked the store clerk for help. The store clerk recommended the ""Voodoo Dick."" 

""How does it work?"" asked the businessman. 
The clerk unwrapped the Voodoo Dick from its ceremonial tiki box and said to it, ""Voodoo Dick that door."" 

The vibrator flew out of the box and attacked the door with such vigor that the door split in half. ""Fantastic,"" said the man. ""I'll take it!""

 He instructed his wife on how to use the Voodoo Dick and left on his business trip. Soon, his wife decided to try it out and said the magic words: ""Voodoo Dick my pussy."" 

The Voodoo Dick flew out of the box and gave her orgasm after orgasm. But soon it became too much, and she couldn't figure out how to make it stop. 

So she got into her car and began driving to the hospital, swerving so much that she got pulled over by the police. 

The policeman asked her why she was driving so recklessly and she explained to him that she had a Voodoo Dick inside her that wouldn't leave her alone. 

The policeman looked at her skeptically and said, ""Yeah right! Voodoo Dick, my ass."""
