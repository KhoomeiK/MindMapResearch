bipolar,fejtrpp,t3_epjm3a,1579185661.0,This happens to me all the time. Ask to go home. If the say no tell them that being there right now is not good for your mental health/stability. I would follow with asking if there is anyway you can pick up an extra shift to make it up. It may surprise you how understanding people can be.

bipolar,fd4ic75,t1_fd05p10,1578167762.0,I literally thought I was the second coming of Christ for a bit. Convinced myself that my hands and feet and back were hurting in the same exact places Jesus was hurt. Wow...... people did NOT like me for that. This was before I knew I had bipolar too.

bipolar,f8oayks,t3_e0t0je,1574670953.0,24 .years old and 22 jobs later. Just quit a place on Friday smh. Rage quitting is really my MO. I had lots of jobs but the past 5 years I’ve been a Barista and I fucking love it! I really need work that’s fast paced and with an outcome I can control so it’s the perfect fit. I know a lot of bp baristas out there! Tip your barista y’all! (had to throw that in there)
