fatlogic,ff3azhc,t1_ff2ycar,1579537659.0,"i think i'm on the right way to think you are missunderstanding what we talk about here.

the mc donalds cheese or hamburger are very very small. And it's 1$ (i googled it).   


Are you talking about the bigger stuff like Big Mac? that one is 3$+ ... it's way much bigger and has waaay more calories."
fatlogic,ff2xi6x,t3_er5s1i,1579527762.0,"A cheeseburger has 305 kcal.  in germany. Is this different in the US? We have very strict laws on that kcal stuff.  
(they're tiny as hell here, too)"
fatlogic,ff2xebv,t1_ff2n73b,1579527661.0,"No one is full from a mc donalds cheeseburger. the small 1$ ones (old price, don't know how much they are in america right now).   


Are you sure, you talk about these ones? They have 304 kcal."

batman,feh0g7k,t1_f3stl2v,1579106546.0,"i love this feeling (i mean, it‘s not a good one). 

Had this once with the movie where will smith is alone in the world with zombie vampires. i thought 2 min after the movie ended: „that makes no sense in the context of the angry vampire guy and his vampire laboratory girl“ and then month later i saw that there was an ending EXACTLY like i thought it should be 2 min after it ended. haha. 
You could be on something here."
batman,fegzza2,t1_fecv3x4,1579106260.0,"i usually never in the hate boner crowd, i‘m for this movie. It was a huge let down because i watched it with high expectations. Maybe that‘s the largest reason for my „hate“ for it."
batman,fegzvcv,t1_fee95d6,1579106195.0,he never implied it‘s bad. He just said it is.
batman,fegzorv,t1_fegsk58,1579106082.0,You ever saw 12 angry men?
batman,feggtup,t1_fefz5j4,1579092300.0,"If you ask that way, watching joker is maybe fine for them. It has a specific spirit, a great actor ... my comments comes from a guy who went to the cinema excited to see it and was waiting for something great to happen and is now disappointed that the imdb ratings are this high. I‘m not a person who thinks only watching old stuff is good, so if they like the movie, fine. On this topic: One flew over the cuckoo‘s nest or even falling down. Would be funny if i watch falling down again and it isn‘t that great anymore haha. I watched it young. My favorite mainstream movie is always „leon the professional“ and Dark Knight. 

What’s your opinion?"

kansascity,fdh71g5,t1_fcxtulv,1578416767.0,"Drug tests are weird to me. Our company has 5 different sorts of beer in the fridge. Is drug testing a ""big"" thing in the us? Like, is it just for very specific jobs?"
kansascity,fdh6wpr,t1_fcvl14o,1578416685.0,"and i'm sitting here, as a german, shocked about that casual ""drug test"" in there, like it is a normal thing to do. Man, it's a company. I have a contract between me and them. America is so weird on that. If they put drug test in my contract, i want to drug test the boss, too."
AskReddit,fckjdjd,t1_fcjtyux,1577726614.0,"also.. 13-15 guys. SO MANY? I can't even imagine that. And all the attentation from them on this two girls, all of them surrounding them, it just feels weird to imagine that. As a man, i know that woman can feel weird around man, and i know, sometimes men don't realize it ... but comeone, when i'm with 15 other friends like this, i must somehow know that this is weird for them, even if the tea thing was true."
