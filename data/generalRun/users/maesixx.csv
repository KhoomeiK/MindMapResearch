bulletjournal,ff3rcz8,t3_erhuja,1579547195.0,"I love the idea of having one central list of what foods I keep in the house or buy on a regular basis. I never remember everything I need when I make my shopping list, and half the time I come home only to realize I need milk or eggs or some other necessities for dinner that night. So the idea of a master grocery list really appealed to me, but it looked so hard and involved! Did I have to stand in front of my fridge and pantry and literally write down everything that was in there, then copy it all (in separate categories) into my Bujo? But what about the things I usually have, but am currently out of? How will I remember to put those on my master list?

Yes, I really do stress myself out over things like this, and I was in a half panicked mode every time I thought about it over the last week. So I decided having an anxiety attack of this wasn’t worth it, and when I got up this morning I just made a huge cup of coffee and settled in to make one. I used 2 I saw online as a guide for categories and even as memory joggers for the items I usually have from those categories. It’s not perfect (apparently my brain thinks “chip” falls alphabetically between “popcorn” and “pudding”, but I love the way it came out 😁"
bulletjournal,ff3po1n,t3_erewty,1579546160.0,I love it!! That’s the kind of unusual art I’d love to have hanging in my apartment.
bulletjournal,ff3ph5p,t1_ff2immk,1579546045.0,I haven’t heard of a Midori before. I’m open to every suggestion and idea! I’ll look into this today; thanks for the tip!
bulletjournal,ff3pcmo,t1_ff2fh1k,1579545967.0,"Oooh, I like that idea!! It would look so cool in my glass door bookcases, and I’d have a legit reason to buy a bunch more journals..."
bulletjournal,ff1oyga,t1_ff1nwqw,1579482947.0,"I never stopped to think that I could use it for just the collections, tracking, and “fun” things without having a monthly or daily planner in it, too. But the more I think about it, the more I’m realizing I’ve never recalled used a planner, just my phone for a calendar and lots of to do lists on little notepads in my house lol 
But the way you do it, just continuing as if there was no break, seems like it would work really well with that; especially how you keep all the yearly things in just the January book.
Thanks for the ideas, I think I might try that! 😁"
bulletjournal,ff1my0y,t1_ff1md6u,1579481844.0,Do you have your collections in their own journal or do you recoup them every time you start a new one?
bulletjournal,ff1mtjm,t1_ff1lklz,1579481781.0,"lol I like that reasoning! I already have a separate one for tracking my weight loss, exercise, and MS, and it’s been working out pretty good, so I can’t imagine having separate ones for collections and daily use would be much different. And it justifies all the money I’ve spent on markers and stickers lately, lol"
bulletjournal,ff1mi3p,t1_ff1liiy,1579481635.0,"I think part of the reason I want to do a bigger journal is bc I’m bummed out that I’ve finished most of my collection page setups, and don’t really have much more to create. I don’t want to lose some of the pages I love, but I’m itching to redo some of the pages I hate... 
But I think your question brings up a good question; what will be easiest in the long run. I honestly don’t know right now, so I’ll have to think on that. Thanks for the help 🙂"
