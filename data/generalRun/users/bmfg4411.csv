Please do not strengthen this thought and let it be as it appears. Also don't make excuses for being alive. You are precious, ranger, the mere aliveness of yours is great. Also you are kind.
I am in mid 30s and had suicidal thoughts all my life.
I had the exact thought as you said.
I can tell you this: be happy that you and your family are alive and enjoy the company and the moment."
