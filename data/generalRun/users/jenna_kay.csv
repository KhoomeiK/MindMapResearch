My son is 27 & I’d NEVER expect him to *want* to hang out with my friends & me.  It’s quite ridiculous actually.  Do not ever feel guilty doing what *you* want - you do not want to be codependent towards another.  It would be different if it was family but her Mom’s coworkers - what could you possibly have in common with them?  It’s actually kind of odd that your gf would even want to hang with them, especially at her age."
