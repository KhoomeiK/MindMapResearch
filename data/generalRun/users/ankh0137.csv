This video does a good job explaining it well](https://youtu.be/7hDb9T3lGhE), cutting them down, and how to cover over the gaps. 

I understand why they did not say about the spray but there is no way I won't be using one.  As for why they gave you white instead of grey is probably because it will look better when they suggest you cover it in a wash/glaze to give them the final colour in a few issues time."
ageofsigmar,ffdlbp7,t3_et0ynt,1579823311.0,"I actually went out grabbed myself 2 issues. The Banshees are just beautiful models. 

I agree with you about the fiddly nature of the Nighthaunt, not be suitable for young players but I feel how good the models look more than makes up for it. 

The magazine does say that you should need to base coat them 3 times. What is surprising is there is no mention of spraying them. I think that is a missed opportunity."

cats,ff80vln,t1_ff7wnqd,1579663078.0,That makes more sense. Hetfield makes for a strange first name.
cats,ff7md1u,t1_ff7jbc2,1579652996.0,Were you also named after the great Papa Het himself?
cats,ff7hi2v,t1_ff7h6gv,1579649670.0,And he does not bit. He loves nothing more than to put fingers in his mouth as he purrs. He will close his mouth but not bite and all the while purring and smiling. It's amazing.
Warhammer40k,ff7crvn,t1_ff6swvl,1579646545.0,That was my first issue as well. Recently picked it up again thanks to eBay for a reasonable price.
ageofsigmar,fen91b0,t3_eq2gw1,1579279612.0,That's a lot of pretty
ageofsigmar,fegfp2c,t3_ep1lrz,1579091203.0,I guess we will find out when they show us.
ageofsigmar,fegfkmu,t3_ep128h,1579091081.0,Tasty. I can't wait to see the Zombie Dragon.
ProRevenge,fe7yynd,t3_enzi50,1578920648.0,And the woman doing the catfishing?
ageofsigmar,fdxif6m,t1_fdxh6u6,1578768993.0,No they are little starter sets for each army. Of the 4 armies I only know FEC. They come in at 470pts. I imagine the other 3 will come in about the same cost.
ageofsigmar,fdxgrlg,t1_fdxendy,1578768539.0,"You will get a full army for Stormcast and Nighthaunt from the standard subscription. The premium gives you a small force for Flesh Eater Courts, Sylvaneth, Orruks and Blades of Khorne. Here is the [https://i.imgur.com/0e5mUy4.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/0e5mUy4.jpg)image of the flyer they show off"
ageofsigmar,fdn77lk,t1_fdmkqpv,1578579175.0,It's 40 per unit. If you are playing a 2000pt game you will need at least 3 Battleline units. That's why  you would have more than one unit.
ageofsigmar,fdn6x16,t1_fdmrufh,1578578951.0,They are cheap Battleline units and that is the big appeal of them really.
ageofsigmar,fdkxjj0,t3_els1pp,1578513213.0,Around 60-80 would probably be s good number I think.
ageofsigmar,fdk6p2q,t1_fdk5vxu,1578497316.0,The value for money is amazing.
ageofsigmar,fdk5318,t1_fdjwo7c,1578496246.0,I have had friends call me up asking me to grab them an issue or two since they are stuck in work. The guy in the shop told me someone came in and bought 4 boxes of them first thing in the morning.
ageofsigmar,fdk491n,t3_els7wx,1578495677.0,This is the only reason I'm taking the Premium sub
ageofsigmar,fdjy1qp,t1_fdjxz5k,1578491067.0,I never noticed that before. Interesting.
ageofsigmar,fdjxju5,t1_fdjx5p7,1578490659.0,No worries. It was actually my other half who grabbed some for herself. I still have to go down and get mine after lunch.
ageofsigmar,fdjwhob,t1_fdjwg3r,1578489747.0,Local newsagent. They arrived today according to them.
ageofsigmar,fdjtp08,t1_fdjtirp,1578487135.0,Not that I have hear.
Warhammer,fdjte3r,t3_elr1k7,1578486832.0,Awesome. You are going to have lots of fun.
KeanuBeingAwesome,fdhio7u,t3_eldgb6,1578423462.0,"I saw them support Republica back in the day. We had no idea that he was even in a band before that gig. Good show. Wish I could remember more, but there might have been some booze involved."
Warhammer40k,fdh65a4,t1_fdh5w0g,1578416207.0,If you think you are wasting your money perhaps you need to stop buying so much.
Warhammer40k,fdh2788,t1_fdh24hw,1578413781.0,Yeah both have a great discount on them. I could not resist myself.
ageofsigmar,fdfukh5,t1_fdfm9cz,1578370601.0,I guess for £6 extra it's almost worth grabbing the 80.
ageofsigmar,fdfhmnx,t3_el39ec,1578361901.0,That's funny I wondering the same thing earlier. I was thinking 60 myself.
Warhammer40k,fdbxcpq,t3_ekhsar,1578263417.0,"I regret not picking these up when they came out. Hopefully one day, if they are priced right."
cats,fcywief,t1_fcynd2h,1578088619.0,"Thank you. I have been so worried, but after this afternoon I know we are going to be okay together."
cats,fcxwldp,t1_fcxuvw6,1578071516.0,I'm good. Plus I feel this is a good bonding experience for us
cats,fcxn499,t1_fcxmlhy,1578066892.0,Thank you. When I leave the room for a moment he tries to follow me. I was expecting him to take his time getting used to his new surroundings but no.
ageofsigmar,fcp0hfm,t1_fco2a62,1577846726.0,Just means they come towards you quicker for you to kill.
Warhammer,fcjz0ct,t3_ehgrf3,1577711140.0,I love it and hate it in equal measure
Warhammer,fbpoz1u,t1_fbkcbpo,1577023555.0,You are a braver man than me. I salute you.
