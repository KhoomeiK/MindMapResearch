BlackPeopleTwitter,ffhc0yo,t1_ffh1e7c,1579929389.0,I really enjoy using Reddit on my computer on the internet and watching auto racing on my television. All of which were primarily developed by white people. See we can both do it. I'm not saying that a huge amount of pop culture has been influenced by black and Latino people but to claim nearly all of it was is hyperbole. Maybe all of the pop culture that you expose yourself to. I also agree with you that a lot of white people hate to admit that the culture that they take part in is influenced by PoC. Also steal culture and oppress PoC. Tons and tons of systemic oppression that I pray one day we as a society will get past
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffhbi51,t1_ffh1psp,1579928871.0,I don't think that that goes without saying. As someone completely unfamiliar with the drag queen community I had zero idea that the community was predominantly any race.
