I haven't slept on my left side in about 14 months now because I randomly convinced myself something bad would happen if I do. I even convinced myself at one point that not being anxious would do the same, which just kind of solidified the cycle since having days where I'm not freaking out just make me freak out more the moment I realize it. Even little things, like looking at a light source when I blink, or having to turn back around if I notice myself gradually do a full 360 rotation (even in video games, which makes going up and down staircases so much more confusing). Some days I feel like I spend more time and energy keeping myself within all these rules than I do just thinking about actual shit.

YMS,fdl60a4,t1_fdl4we4,1578517633.0,"That makes sense. Like I said, I definitely have much less knowledge of music production than most other playback mediums, so most of this is pretty surface level observations. I appreciate the insight, those are definitely some good points"

The biggest holdback music always had to me was in trying to make it sound familiar and expected, as opposed to satisfying or right. That wording probably sounds a little nebulous, but I think there's a lot more room to expand when songwriters don't confine themselves to genre, structures, and especially not song length. I think something like prog rock or a lot of the electronic subgenres (the ones that aren't focused on dancing) probably have a lot more variety for the amount of songs they have vs something like classic rock or any era of pop"
YMS,fdl37wr,t1_fdl27yx,1578516291.0,"Yeah, I guess that's what I was trying to get at by saying there's much less room for development in other areas. You can break down the different parts of the melody, and look at the aesthetic or timbre or whatever, but overall I think it relies on more of a ""gut feeling"" kind of sense than something like film or literature which can be broken down into a lot of distinct aspects that can then be broken down themselves into their own aspects. So if a film has a very similar plot or aesthetic, then there's still other aspects like character writing, acting, etc that can distinguish it, whereas if a song has a similar structure or aesthetic, then that's more or less kind of it. This is also discounting lyrics of course, but even then you don't have much more than prose and themes to really break that down, compared to any other written form (besides short-form poetry ofc)"
YMS,fdl1r82,t1_fdl0rwe,1578515547.0,"Music is kind of novel case in this discussion to me, since there is much less running time than any other medium, and so much modern (i.e. past 50-100 years) contemporary music shares such a cripplingly similar structure, that there's not nearly as much room for development in other areas imo. I'd say this has gotten much better in the past 10 or 20 years, since services like iTunes and Spotify allow for less radio-friendly artists to gain a bigger following, which leads to music that falls outside the 3-minute pop/rock lyrical format to thrive and develop. Not to mention aesthetics play a *much* bigger part, since the ""sound"" of a given song/album/artist being similar to another can really force the brain to categorize them together. Unfortunately I have much less historical knowledge of the production of music (besides the fact that the modern pop industry is by far one of the most soulless and derivative of the entertainment industries, which is really saying something given what it's up against with Hollywood, TV, etc)"
YMS,fdl0it9,t1_fdl0bco,1578514899.0,"Oh I was thinking more about tone and episode structure, not to mention quality of voice acting. But like you said, a lot of that is just kind of inherent to the medium and time it was made"
YMS,fdkzx8v,t1_fdkw8e4,1578514580.0,"Yeah, that definitely makes sense. I mean after seeing the YMS Highlights video of Adam showing off Kimba, it's pretty obvious to me that Kimba resembles something like Astro Boy or even a newer anime show like Digimon much more closely than it does The Lion King. Personally, I feel like I hear TLK called a ripoff of Hamlet more than I do Kimba, which is kind of its own discussion since that is more in story structure than aesthetics. But then it also implies that any one story holds a monopoly over a given structure, which kind of ends up at the same problem of limiting creative iteration by requiring every single story to be 100% original in every possible way, which is simply not the case for practically any story that's ever been told. I do appreciate you attempting to start a discussion on this though, it's not something I see talked about a lot and has always kind of bugged me over the years as just a cheap way to downplay a work that someone doesn't like without providing any real useful criticism. 

You are also correct in that Disney's behavior is much more damnable than anything in TLK itself, but unfortunately that's not exactly anything new for the company either."
YMS,fdkv24p,t3_elru2g,1578511749.0,"The word ripoff gets kind of overused in general imo. I remember when The Hunger Games was huge, people were saying a lot that it was a ripoff of Battle Royal, but Suzanne Collins is on record multiple times telling the story of her watching TV late at night and seeing a war movie and something with students back to back and the two concepts merging together. It's very possible that she may have at least heard of BR at some point in the past and it subconsiously affected that, but to go as far as ripoff (which to me implies a distinct deliberate attempt to copy something point-for-point) is just ludicrous. And even if she was directly inspired by BR for the idea, the focus of the book Hunger Games is so much more on the society around the games and the survival techniques of the main character, as opposed to BR being about the psychology of people who are forced to turn against each other and how different personalities respond to that situation in drastically different ways. 

At some point it just hinders the very idea of creativity, since anything that might happen to have even a remotely similar concept, even if the execution, focus, plot, and themes are all drastically different, to anything that's come before in any medium, gets called a ripoff. Not to mention it devalues the labeling of any actual plagiarized works, where the attempt to directly copy something was deliberate or even malicious in intent (like when Dreamworks pushed their original movie back specifically so that they could make a CG bug movie before Bugs Life came out)."

People tend to get bored thinking of McGuffins in a big scale movie like that, so recontextualizing them to be used for a different purpose later makes them feel so much more distinct than something like the vague box things in the Justice League movie. It would have been so easy to have Thanos go around the universe taking them from new unseen locations, with maybe one or two in familiar places like the one from Guardians, but making almost all of them things we had seen before ended up giving Thanos' eventual invasion so much more weight and build-up"
marvelstudios,fc6x24v,t1_fc6gj0s,1577491706.0,"I can totally understand your hesitation to believe in a 100% practical/film shot movie, especially given Marvel's consistent structure of how they handle action and spectacle, but if there's ever a time for them to take a legitimate risk like that, it'd be after riding the cultural and financial high from Endgame. Plus, I mean there was an entire industry that relied on miniatures, matte paintings, and perspective tricks for decades before CG became the norm while still putting out huge scale sci-fi movies, so it's not like it's out of the question. And there's recent movies like Blade Runner and Kubo that have gone out of their way to make huge sprawling fantasy/scifi adventures with massive amounts of practical effects purely for the principle of it, so it's not exactly a dead form of moviemaking either. I'm not 100% entirely convinced myself, but I am super ready for Marvel to prove me wrong and blow me away, especially since that's the movie that I know by far the least about as of now"

I think they went as far as they can in the ridiculous comedy direction, but there's a lot more they could do with the real life gang aspect"

TrueAskReddit,fbsj8cd,t1_fbsbv0c,1577055982.0,"His use of the phrase ""bad guys"" is pretty spot on in terms of the problem. I know a lot of politicians are genuinely horrible people, but lumping an entire ""side"" as evil is unbelievably reductive and childish. The frustration I have is that politics seems to more often than not refer to social issues instead of structural issues. The word ""Politics"" to me refers to government structure, money distribution, schools, etc, but most ""political"" discussion I see just tends to be about racism/sexism/etc. At this point the term has lost basically all of its meaning as far as I'm concerned"
