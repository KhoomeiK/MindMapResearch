Advice,ffaoi3e,t3_d88x0u,1579740776.0,"I know this is late, but I cheated in college as well. I have a learning disability and autism and while I whole heartedly agree that they aren’t good excuses, I believe some people do have reasonable reasons to cheat. Doesn’t mean you should do it, but yeah I totally get what you’re feeling my dude. I cheated in my first semester of college on some math tests and a history test. I ended up getting a D in math and not passing on to the next class. I had to retake it. I also got a C in history. It may not seem like it, but I really did try to work my butt off in the first semester. If you’ve been in highs school, you know that the teaching is very bad if you’re not in the gifted classes. Especially If you’re disabled. They treat you like you’re stupid. High schools like to say they prepare you for college, but get this. Me and many other students at my college came in with a 6th grade writing level.

Eventually I learned from my mistakes and worked harder than ever to get good grades. I even went to summer school to get my first A in math. It’s wonderful because my disability is related to math! I also won an award for having a 3.5 GPA or above with 4 classes! All in all, if you cheat entirely through college, you are stupid and don’t deserve you’re achievements, but if you learn early on or you just learn from it in general, you can make up for your wrong doings. I still feel guilty, but it’s because I haven’t gotten it off my chest. But I am proud of myself for getting past that phase. I’m also proud of myself for going against all odds because I’ve heard that 72% of people with autism drop out with in the first year. I’m in my second year and ready for more!"

antifeminists,ff4o856,t3_erek02,1579568420.0,I saw this post yesterday and chuckled.
SmashBrosUltimate,ff41whf,t1_ff3epsg,1579553748.0,"Yeah no kidding. It’s kind of the same problem with the FE characters where half the characters are clones. I don’t think either one of them deserve to have character spots taken away, they just need a bit more diversity. They need to pick between young link and toon link. I’d personally pick toon link because he’s cute and its a different art style in the Zelda series."
SmashBrosUltimate,ff41nxj,t1_ff36qpu,1579553599.0,"Yes I agree. Some adjustments should be made and some people will disagree with me and that would be fine, but I think Corrin needs to be cut and Chrom and Lucian should be changed to alt costumes. Either that or they need to choose between Chrom or Roy. That would then leave us more spaces for 3 other FE characters who aren’t lords or sword users. My gosh I want Hild for FE 3 houses now! 

Yeah I think having every veteran come back was part of the imbalance issue as well as maybe some of the Echo fighters. I wanted Byleth actually, but I would have much rather had a Zelda character end the pass. I really wanted Ghirahim back in SSB4, but I think you can see why that may not happen. Maybe what Sakurai can do next time is he can get some of the FE team to develop the characters and move-sets for the FE characters and he can review them and then he can also make other characters for franchises like Kirby. Especially with his health, it sounds like he needs all the help he can get. Poor guy."
SmashBrosUltimate,ff40sxi,t1_ff3bu8g,1579553065.0,"Yeah I wanted a Zelda character. Hopefully it’s in the next fighters pass. I think an imbalance in the roster was bound to happen with the “Everyone is here” part of ultimate. I’m sure some veterans like Corrin or Pichu might get cut in the next game. Mostly because, correct me if I’m wrong about Pichu, I’ve heard that they are not the most favorite of characters. Corrin especially with his bland personality and being a player character like the rest of the FE characters. Man hopefully we can get some different characters from different classes in FE next time like a cavalier or something. I think Byleth has brought us closer to that."
SmashBrosUltimate,ff361d0,t1_fejm141,1579534528.0,Finally someone says it!
SmashBrosUltimate,ff34de9,t1_ff2r1cx,1579533369.0,"Yeah. People can have their opinions. I wanted Byleth. I think some of the the complaints against the FE characters are justified, but some of them are also just plain silly. Like the too many anime sword fighters argument. The sword fight part is valid and we need other weapons like Byleth has. The anime part how ever isn’t. Like 90% of the roster is anime and Nintendo is a Japanese company. I think I’ve even seen Mario and Kirby in anime TV shows. Also the whole fight over FE having as many characters as Pokémon is dumb too. Fire emblem, even though it isn’t as popular as Pokémon or Mario, is a growing franchise and I think it definitely does deserve 8 characters. Nintendo said themselves that it’s a major IP now. I think in the next game though Sakurai needs to put a bit more attention on other franchises and refine the FE roster so half of it isn’t so same-ish. 

The posts that really grind my gears are the ones that speak on behalf of the whole community like we all have the same thinking process. There’s people saying stuff like “ we didn’t want Byleth!” even though there clearly is people who wanted him. And then there’s the people that tell you to be happy with the character no matter what. To some degree I agree with the fact that we should be happy and grateful that we are getting DLC characters, but that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be able to speak our mind about something we dislike. I’m gonna say it, I could have cared less about the other 4 DLC characters, but they are fun. People do the same with Byleth."
SmashBrosUltimate,ff2odc0,t3_eq3iao,1579516210.0,"Yes I whole heartedly agree. 8 is just about right for FE. I love that franchise! But I’m an Even bigger Zelda fan. I wanted Girahim, but... it’s too emotional to talk about... I want Revali or Sidon. But mostly Revali. Maybe we could also get a Zelda botw too. There was a mii fighter costume for Zelda shown for the extra DLC pack so it’s a possibility."

generalizedanxiety,ff20xt5,t3_ebo8t3,1579490861.0,"I’m diagnosed with autism and I’m wonder if I have GAD. If you don’t mind, could you answer my question? When you have GAD, is it normal to have anxiety even if you aren’t worrying about something? Of course I worry a bunch, but there’s also lots of times where I have anxiety and I’m not worrying about anything at the moment. It just like my brain is on high alert all the time. I get pain in my ribs and neck from all the tension and stuff. Distracting myself seems to help me not focus on my anxiety, but it’s still there."

SmashBrosUltimate,ff1tpnw,t1_ff1psoq,1579485964.0,"Yeah it’s ridiculous. People keep complaining and saying that FE shouldn’t have as much representation as Mario. Maybe this is just a different perspective, but isn’t more representation for a slightly less popular franchise a good thing? Even if you aren’t an FE fan, you have to know that More representation = more money and more money = more games. Yes it’s ridiculous that there’s mostly only sword fighters for FE and yes it’s ridiculous that Kirby only has 3 characters. Doesn’t mean we have to cut down FE’s roster though. Some rosters in the game like FE and Pokémon I would say need a bit of a refresh though."

SmashBrosUltimate,fezxeyq,t1_fezwkhd,1579462939.0,I think people would have fought ever which one should have been in. Like people would fight over whether Dimitri or Claude should have gotten in if Edelguard got in. I think Byleth was the safest choice.
SmashBrosUltimate,fezwg1s,t1_fek7x9p,1579462547.0,IKR?
SmashBrosUltimate,feztq4e,t1_feloujn,1579461540.0,"Yeah the to many FE characters argument is ridiculous. I agree the weapons need to be more diverse, but if a franchise has that many characters, that is a great thing because it means it’s getting more popular and making more money. Also, it’s not really the amount of characters that’s the problem. It’s that fact that all of them primarily use swords ( except for Robin and Byleth) and they’re either lords or the player character. I don’t think the any of the three house leaders could make it in because so many people would like all three of them instead of just Edelguard. I think Sakurai did his best with Byleth in order to make sure we had a very weapon diverse character. Now it’s Hilda’s turn!

It’s funny how people complain that there’s too many fire emblem characters, but then they want Waluigi or Geno who are part of the franchise that has the most characters. You could argue that Mario is more popular than FE. But at the same time, does a franchise being less popular than Mario mean that it can’t have as many or close to as many characters as Mario. No I don’t  think so. If it were a game like Wii fit or something, yeah that game shouldn’t have near the same amount of characters as Mario. But Even if Fire Emblem isn’t at the same level of popularity as Mario, it’s still popular. It deserves the characters it has."

SmashBrosUltimate,fezoyjq,t1_f66yzxi,1579459843.0,What if it’s fierce deity Link?
SmashBrosUltimate,fezo2fa,t3_epnijx,1579459538.0,"I totally get that people want different franchises represented, but does it honestly matter if FE has 8 characters? Pokémon isn’t as popular as Mario so maybe Pokémon doesn’t deserve 8 characters. Kirby isn’t as popular as Mario so maybe Kirby doesn’t deserve 8 characters. The whole number thing is just stupid. If a franchise has that many characters, that is a good thing and means that it is growing. I’m a Zelda fan and I want another Zelda character too! But that doesn’t mean that FE fans have to take a back seat and stop getting cool ass characters. 

I’m an FE fan and it’s not the number of characters that’s the problem. It’s the characters that represent the game that’s the problem. Byleth is the first axe, bow and spear user we have in the FE roster. Robin also uses magic. The rest of the characters use swords and Corrin has that weird trash bag arm thing going on. I for one think that there’s adjustments to be made to the fire emblem roster, but the too many characters thing is ridiculous. There’s no rule saying that other franchises can’t have as many characters as Mario, even if they aren’t as popular. I for one also believe that the Pokémon roster needs adjustments too. We have what like 5 starter Pokémon? How about another grass type or fairy type that’s not a starter."

SmashBrosUltimate,fewfl8a,t1_few3uhf,1579409773.0,"Not to mention people who like or hate the character get hate. Fire emblem is a dam good game, but I also don’t like so many Mario characters so I can empathize with the non RPG players. I agree that there needs to be more diversity among the fire emblem characters like an axe user, but I’m still excited for Byleth. Fire Emblem deserves representation, but so do other franchises. I’m fine with 8 characters, but I also want more Zelda. People want to completely stop adding fire emblem characters in forever and I don’t think that’s the right way to go about it. Just because a franchise has more reps, it doesn’t mean that it shouldn’t have more characters, just give other franchises a bit more attention. Like since we got our FE character now, we should have some Zelda or Mario (even though I’m personally not a fan unless it’s the 3D games). It’s like we’re forgetting that Japan exists too. Sakurai went to work with an IV drip for us so at the end of the day, even if we don’t like the character, we should still love the dude!"
