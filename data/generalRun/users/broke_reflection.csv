TwoXChromosomes,fgy70im,t3_f0pzvx,1581180132.0,There's no question you were assaulted by your uncle. Absolutely. Sorry that your blood family has further tramautized you by gaslighting you. I hope therapy helps. I'd cut contact with anyone in your family that has tried to make you think what your uncle did was okay.

trashy,fgo7xi3,t1_fgnx32w,1580962005.0,There was a video of him in the kitchen I believe yelling and people said it was proof he was abusing her. Brought out the pitchforks and wouldn't see his movies etc. I low-key didn't buy it (the video just didn't seem to show an abuser imo but maybe I've had more experience than others ?) but said nothing to no one. Looks like I'm finally right about something.. I haven't heard the Depp haters say anything of course. Wonder if they are watching his movies again.

She's being pretty obvious IMO). And not only is she cheating on you but she doesn't sound like a good mother either so you are staying married to have someone to have sex with. Kinda gross. Give your kids better. Find a job with less travel and commit to them, not the cheating wife. Also you will be a single dad with decent income, finding women won't be that hard."

I would move with the children to a friend or family member's house and give him the option of visiting the children. Let him figure out his big boy problems of where to live and buy cigarettes.

But I will say there are benefits, especially if you've left a cheating, emotionally abusive person. There's a lot of loneliness but there is some peace in not having to deal with the ex. Having your house to yourself and not having to stress about what they will say or do, is a perk. You can go about your own home judgement free. Hang on to those small perks for now."

The time apart to really think about it, have some distance and think about the next step without being in each other's faces is a good idea. And sooner is always better. Life is short.

Good people don't comparison shop. If you think someone is looking for someone better, don't bother staying with the relationship. 

That's true. You shouldn't make someone your everything when you are just a sometimes to them. But if you are, move on. 

Definitely can't control the other person, agree!! And be kind to yourself, always.
