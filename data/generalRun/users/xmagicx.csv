For example:

• Is this the first offence she has? Has she otherwise been a great kid. Obviously you didnt know and this went on for two years so other elements could have been hidden but to your knowledge is she a good kid otherwise.

• How damning and severe was the evidence? Was it all from one source? Was her rebuttal / defence believable? And, linked to my first question, in line with what you believe to be her character?

• Does her brother go to the same school? Can he confirm one side of the story?


• What has your previous punishment escalation process been? Have you been, as an example, 3 warnings then punishment parents? Start with minor punishments and build up as required or are you frequently harsher? 

And as a follow up do you feel this is in line with how you usually behave? While you will probably correctly think that her behaviour is out of what you thought her character is and is also severe in its instance, your the adults and consistency, especially through childhood is key. Both as sending a combined message as parents but also in your actions so they know boundaries.


As a bit of experiance to show what I mean, when I was a kid, maybe 10, around May time I opened the car door when my Mum stopped at a crossing, because you couldn't open the window the whole way down without doing so, and I wanted the window down.

My mum rightly freaked out on the basis that I could have been hurt and you dont open car doors.

And then she grounded me for the remainder of the year.it felt harsh, and it became a but of jokes for years amongst my friends. Now I tell the story not to criticise your choice but to say that, my mum was erratic on her punishments, I never knew where I stood and it became difficult to know how to act or where my boundaries were and had a big impact on my relationship with her.

Good luck with your choice and I hope it works out for you. Tbh you communicated and parents together, gave a unified message and then answered questions calmly so I think you will be fine."
