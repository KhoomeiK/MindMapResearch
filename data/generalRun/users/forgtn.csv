I have spent many years playing Counter Strike and I guess that is part of the reason I expect games to be balanced and to actually work.

It seems like you're apprehensive and fearful of the future. That can absolutely put a damper on positive emotions. Fear and worry are powerful and can creep up without you realizing it at first.

Wish you the best, friend"
todayilearned,ff6d7g2,t1_ff62hfw,1579624642.0,"I disagree. Anyone can set goals but can find themselves ultimately dispassionate about. Usually when someone finds something they are so interested in, they feel they need to call it a ""purpose"" because it's more important than just a standard goal. 

Obviously not everyone is going to find themselves wanting to save humanity, or fight crime, or whatever. But there is no need to be depressed if you can't find a ""life purpose"" in the traditional sense. You can actually find meaning in being a family-person. Or helping people through your work. Among other things. Call it what you will. 

I think the important point is that people usually have the innate desire to do something of value in society in some way. It's not about ""my goal is to make some money so I can buy a cool car"". It's more like ""what I'm doing is important to people, so I need to do it"". People want to feel valuable, important, by serving their fellow humans somehow. And I don't mean in an egotistical way.

If you haven't figured this out yet, there is nothing to be depressed about. You can have self worth from trying to excel at whatever you do. The act of trying can be enough. Always moving forward even if it's small."
todayilearned,ff5tv20,t1_ff5scwt,1579610041.0,"Try to find if you are suppressing your emotions for any reason (may require a therapist for this). Also get proper sleep, exercise, eat healthy food. Proper social life. Find something you enjoy doing (you can't be expected to enjoy every activity as everyone is different). Ask yourself about your meaning or purpose. Your purpose could be to find your purpose in life. Or to find the best things for you to do while in search of a purpose. What are your dreams and aspirations? Things like this.
If all of those are checked and you still feel like something is wrong, you may want to see a mental health professional for an evaluation. It may be helpful to do it anyway. I'm not a professional myself but I do have some experience with mental issues such as depression and anxiety. 

Hope this helps you clear things up a little. 

Also there is a really good book called Man's Search For Meaning by Viktor Frankl. It should be something everyone reads, imo. It can help most people. The man lived through the holocaust as a psychologist. Great book.

cogsci,fexdy9r,t1_fewvw3u,1579429416.0,"If you actually believe that you could not have done those things without drugs then you are greatly mistaken. 

If you are unmotivated without drugs then there is some other issue. Being under the influence of cannabis or anything else is not your true self. You can defend it until death, but the fact still stands. Find your real true self and accept it and work with it. Taking shortcuts with drugs is a weak way of approaching life and is ultimately counter-productive, especially if you end up losing access to the drug you depend on.

Also if you have a chemical problem that's very serious like schizophrenia, real clinical depression due to TBI or something, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, etc. then drugs may be necessary. But of course ""being high makes things easier"" sounds like your approach. If you hate yourself and your life without drugs then perhaps you should figure out why and solve it. I'm not a professional so don't take my word for it, but I do know that intoxicating drugs are not the answer to life's problems."
