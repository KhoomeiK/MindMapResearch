There's nothing funny about the Pam and Boom Mic guy. It's a serious series of scenes where we are ment to believe that Pam could ever have an affair with the boom mic guy.

DunderMifflin,fgphy5o,t1_fgpcir3,1581005149.0,"Exactly. I think what erks so many people is that it feels like a betrayal of character. The writers build these characters and then try to make the audience think they don't really know them. 

Example. Everyone hates Cathy because she tries to break up Jim and Pam.( the hate is justified) but the story line works because we never believe for a second Jim could betray his character and Pam. The Boom Mic guy storyline tries to make us believe that Pamalama Ding Dong Beasley could betray Jim and it feels like total bullshit.  And opposite of her character."
