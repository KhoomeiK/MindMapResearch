Even though the ability for the dads as male authority figures to interfere in a relationship makes me feel icky, you used your patriarchal power for good here and I commend that"
tifu,fgns9e2,t3_ezd26e,1580951783.0,The fact that you’re a girl was a twist I was not expecting
offmychest,fgn10bd,t3_ez7s4q,1580935623.0,Your love is so beautiful! It sounds like you have such a good balance of giving and receipt of love in your relationship and I strive to have that with my boyfriend too. Couple goals for sure
TodayIWore,fgn0l76,t3_ezdmmm,1580935411.0,I’m in love with that jumpsuit and the whole outfit!!!
tifu,fgllj4g,t3_eyz5om,1580903349.0,Make your move! At least you realized he was making moves after the fact :)
Zoomies,fgf9ss3,t3_ey0qgn,1580731556.0,Awww he’s so cute!! I hope your brother gets to keep him lol
Thrift,fg6ggb6,t3_ewzulm,1580567279.0,A lot of costume departments spray their things with a mixture that is part water and part vodka in order to get smells out of non-washable garments
TodayIWore,fg0r1ef,t3_ew9e3n,1580413335.0,I love your aesthetic!! I’d never think to put those things together but it looks awesome on you
AmItheAsshole,fg0qwpj,t3_ew4zxd,1580413265.0,"NTA. Just because your friend is grieving, she shouldn’t get off for making such an insensitive comparison. Grief is not a linear process and time will not make up for losing a child, or even a pet for that matter. Even though I’ve loved and lost pets, I can’t even imagine the horror of losing a human family member."

AmItheAsshole,ffxs4js,t3_evqd98,1580331340.0,"You’re absolutely NTA and I think the hoodies sound brilliant! Clearly your mom doesn’t care about right to consent to the photos, which makes her the asshole"
MadeMeCry,ffxasn1,t3_evkexy,1580321329.0,He’s very sweet to have comforted you like that. I’m so sorry for your loss

AmItheAsshole,ffroga6,t3_eud20b,1580162292.0,YTA. This is sick and twisted. She’ll have to learn the truth at some point and lying to her is not protecting her
AmItheAsshole,ffro89a,t3_euozcj,1580162155.0,"YTA, learn how to cook if you don’t like what she’s making. Being a stay at home mom is a full time job and she surely does tons of other home care that you are ungrateful for and not even considering"
AmItheAsshole,ffrnyfi,t3_eume5x,1580161988.0,"NTA, her offspring ruined your belongings. She brought that child into the world, and it is her responsibility to keep her under control until the little one knows not to break things"
AmItheAsshole,ffrnneh,t3_eug5ap,1580161803.0,"NTA, I feel bad for the other guy, but he needed to be told about his issue sooner or later and you had to deal with the humiliation or puking and the stench"
AmItheAsshole,ffrn90b,t3_eurgiz,1580161561.0,"NTA, your friend sounds like a dickhead"
AmItheAsshole,ffrmsz8,t3_eun0ne,1580161291.0,"YTA, you know that religious sentiments make them uncomfortable, yet you’re adding on discomfort when they’re having a difficult time. Sounds like now you are trying to shove it in their faces. Not cool"
AmItheAsshole,ffrmlwi,t3_eurnrb,1580161172.0,"NTA, they both deserve to be kicked out"
AmItheAsshole,ffrmeg2,t3_eunolg,1580161048.0,"NTA, I can totally see how this could add stress for your kid and make things seem less relaxing or less normal about his first day if family is coming from out of town. Maybe you could have them meet up after school for early dinner or something to celebrate the first day after it has already happened, if your kid would enjoy seeing them?"
AmItheAsshole,ffrm5lm,t3_euscce,1580160898.0,"NTA, they are adults, you warned them what could happen, and they should be able to find their own way home. I think you’re extra kind for providing them money for bus fair, but that that’s not even your responsibility"
AmItheAsshole,ffrly2r,t3_euo7vj,1580160771.0,"NTA, she didn’t have to be unnecessarily cruel to you for so many years, and she should have the awareness to know the impression that could have made on you. My parents have opened their arms to many of my significant others, both the ones the liked, and those that they didn’t like and she doesn’t get a pass for just deciding that she loves you now."
AmItheAsshole,ffrlhpz,t3_euoks9,1580160494.0,"YTA, carry your weight, OP. Your attitude and acceptance of a dirty space is why women still end up doing so much more housework than men."
AmItheAsshole,ffrkvbh,t3_euqs2b,1580160116.0,"NTA, you gave your daughter agency over her haircut and she wanted it shorter. You also get more say if you are doing the physical and emotional labor of dealing with her hair. Your husband is simply objectifying your daughter and controlling you if he’s acting like something as simple as a haircut is such a big deal"
AmItheAsshole,ffrkm7w,t3_eurjt5,1580159965.0,"NTA, the maternal mortality rate is pretty low in the US (barring some major racial discrepancies), so it sounds like they are catastrophizing the situation. Everything right now should be about you and your comfort, and they should not be projecting their trauma onto you"
AmItheAsshole,ffrk76r,t3_eup5jx,1580159712.0,"YTA, big time. This was insensitive and tone deaf of you to do this in the first place, and even more so to be mad at the bride for it. I can’t even imagine asking someone if I could propose at their wedding, let alone doing it, with no permission from the couple."
offmychest,ffrjje3,t3_eumu7b,1580159311.0,"This is so lovely! The other day my boyfriend and I did face masks, both applying it to the other’s face, and it was a similar kind of relaxing, sweet and affectionate. It’s sweet that you’re growing together and teaching your boyfriend how to show you love in a way that caters to your love language better!"

clevercomebacks,ff75rfm,t1_ff75ka0,1579641671.0,"It depends on the nationalities of the speakers, but cunt is viewed as highly sexist and offensive in the U.S. because it is used towards women, and only used as an unusually harsh insult. It’s like the harsher form of bitch, from what I understand"
