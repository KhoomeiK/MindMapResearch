relationship_advice,ffnmn82,t1_ffnka0u,1580067930.0,I second this. It is a two way street!
sex,ffmgwaa,t3_eu8dzj,1580054511.0,My advice would be to have a doctor take a look at it.
sex,fflf0bn,t3_eu5bl5,1580038883.0,Pulling out is not a form of birth control. I suggest buying a box of condoms or going on the pill/IUD. It saves a lot of worry!
relationship_advice,ffla6sd,t3_eu575m,1580036970.0,I think maybe you should talk to your boyfriend and sees how he feels about everything.
relationship_advice,ffkuxfq,t1_ffkus2w,1580029378.0,"You can always write in it and then put it in a safe place where no one can read it. You can also make a document in your phone and keep it there, depending on the phone applications you have."
relationship_advice,ffku3l5,t3_eu4eac,1580028910.0,Have you considered maybe writing down your thoughts and how you feel? It is a good way to let them out.
offmychest,ffivxwk,t3_etw157,1579984001.0,I'm glad that things worked out for you. I'm happy for you!
sex,ffirnap,t3_etvby7,1579980993.0,"No, I would not take a guy's word for it. Unless you have known him for a long time. I would get tested with the guy before having sex with him."
relationship_advice,ffhuzhw,t1_ffhufuc,1579955157.0,"No problem. If he is interested, he definitely needs to prove it to you."
relationship_advice,ffhttxs,t3_etpwzq,1579953581.0,My advice would be to let him start a conversation and see if he is interested in talking to you without you having to start every conversation. It is possible that he is shy as well.
aww,ffhf5k0,t3_etn2iy,1579932662.0,She is beautiful!
cats,ffhev33,t3_etn1pz,1579932339.0,My cat is the same way. Especially when I am sleeping and she takes half the bed!

ottawa,ff4aza1,t1_ff484n5,1579559405.0,I second The Pelican!
relationship_advice,fey44g9,t3_eqw7s4,1579440590.0,"Maybe you can discuss with her on things she can do to help make it feel more pleasurable for you, instead of saying she is awful at it. I know if someone told me I was awful at it, I would want to know ways for me to improve in that area."
lgbt,fexu2zo,t3_eqvad9,1579436270.0,"Well, Grindr is a hookup app by definition, but that doesn't mean there isn't anyone on there looking for something more. I have found that there are guys on there that do look for more, but it is also like looking for a needle in a haystack.   
Tinder can be a good app as well, I have noticed some genuine people on there."
offmychest,fextqss,t1_fextlj1,1579435989.0,"My response isn't negative. If you feel like this place is such a negative place, you don't have to be here, you can find a place that better suits you and what you are comfortable with. I just feel like if you don't have a good opinion of Reddit and you are still here, then it's on you."
offmychest,fextbjg,t3_eqvhj7,1579435678.0,"If you think it is such a negative place, then why are you still on it? There are definitely positive people out there who want to help others and be there for others like myself. Not everyone on here is what you are describing."
sex,fexqt6i,t3_eqvc8c,1579434868.0,I think that it might be best to see a doctor if you are concerned about it.
offmychest,fexo1r9,t3_eqjoxa,1579433824.0,Congratulations! I'm really happy for you and your wife! :)

sex,fesblqb,t3_eqi4p5,1579363557.0,I'm sorry to hear that you were treated that way and that you are going through a difficult time. You are more than welcome to DM me or send me a message if you'd like someone to talk to.
offmychest,ferq33b,t3_eqgfva,1579357059.0,"Please do not hurt yourself or take your own life. You are worth living. You mean something to all of us. Suicide is a permanent decision that can never be taken back. If you feel like you are going to hurt yourself or take your own life, please seek medical attention immediately."
relationship_advice,ferpqfh,t1_ferk1fk,1579356963.0,You're welcome!
relationship_advice,fera8hq,t3_eqfynn,1579351703.0,"I think that it is a win because you opened yourself up to her. It was a tough thing to do. You can't control how she reacts and she still loves you. She might not understand how you feel, but she still loves you. If you don't feel comfortable around her right now, my advice would be to put some space between the both of you until you both can talk openly about this."
relationship_advice,fer5me6,t1_fer546y,1579350112.0,I understand and it is okay to be scared.
sex,fer4ul3,t3_eqfllx,1579349830.0,"My advice.... Don't let anyone else know about it, because it isn't their business, and once you tell one person, it may go to another and it starts a chain reaction. Just keep it between the both of you. Also, keep what happens in the bedroom away from the workplace."
relationship_advice,fer2nob,t1_fer2iau,1579348957.0,I understand. Could you maybe write a letter to him explaining how you feel and give it to them?
relationship_advice,fer1tcj,t1_fer0xs1,1579348596.0,Are you close with your friends?
relationship_advice,feqx64g,t1_feqx262,1579347088.0,I understand for sure. Do you have friends or people you are close with that you can spend time with?
relationship_advice,feqvae9,t1_fequbjq,1579346437.0,"Well, it is all about being a team and communicating. If he doesn't feel the same way about you, you can't force him to like you. Just because he wants things to work, and you do as well, doesn't mean that they will. It is hard work to have a relationship."
relationship_advice,feqrog4,t1_feqok32,1579345232.0,"I second this! You need to do things to make yourself and focus on yourself. You can't make someone else have feelings for you or care about you. You can only control your own actions, not the actions of others."
relationship_advice,feqqo8e,t3_eqeym9,1579344984.0,"I think that talking to him in a private place about it is best, and not around other people. Ask him what his intentions are and ask him if he has a thing for you. Take things slow. You don't have to share what goes on between you with other people, especially if you know that the culture isn't open to homosexuality."
ottawa,feproz8,t3_eqagot,1579328996.0,Brother Chiu's on Woodroffe. Massive portions!
ottawa,feooi1k,t3_eq7tjw,1579303073.0,"Hey man, I understand this is really scary. I sent you an IM in case you'd like someone to talk to about it. I can relate to how you feel."

offmychest,fe1knuy,t3_enm9qw,1578827662.0,"I'm sorry to hear that she kicked you out during a typhoon, but I think that for you it was a blessing in disguise. I'm glad that things have worked out and that you can be happy with your husband and in a place that doesn't have her negativity!"
sex,fe1jwn5,t3_enm7v8,1578827479.0,"My advice would be to ask a doctor or medical professional about this. I am not a professional myself, but it could be related to how much/what you eat, your diet, exercise, etc."
relationship_advice,fe1je3f,t1_fe1j7ro,1578827242.0,Absolutely! I also sent you an IM chat message if you would like to chat privately about this. :)
relationship_advice,fe1fvdz,t3_enlz53,1578826020.0,"Unfortunately, when it comes to something such as a substance, all you can do is keep on trying to talk to him and help him get out of it, but the situation falls back on him and he needs to make the chance for himself. He is the only one that can fully get himself out of this. At the same time, you can always suggest to him a rehab facility, NA meetings, etc."
sex,fdwsp2b,t3_en9sqz,1578762000.0,"One thing that I think it has a possibility of causing is a UTI. That's the only thing I can think of. If you are both sexually clean, other than the UTI, I don't think from my knowledge that there is any danger associated with it."
