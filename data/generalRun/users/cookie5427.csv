Edit: To clarify, I work in an operating theatre. Marking the contralateral creates confusion and once the skin prep has been put on, the writing often disappears. If the limb which has been cleaned and prepped now has no mark and the other has a mark, the incorrect limb may be operated on. I have seen patients who have had wrong side surgery. It affects a lot of lives, not just the person being operated upon."
