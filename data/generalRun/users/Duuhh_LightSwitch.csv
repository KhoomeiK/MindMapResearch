What they are suggesting is that this becomes one thing among many that people will judge you on—like being 5 minutes late for your interview or showing up looking a little shabby.

It's obviously hard to argue with the results you've found using this technique. At the same time, you can't dismiss the opinions of people who do hiring that have suggested not to do this.
