interestingasfuck,ffb1jbf,t1_ffaergc,1579749476.0,Julius Caesar was actually pretty bald irl. Some depictions of him have more hair than he had bc he was very self conscious about being bald
pics,ff2yv0l,t1_ff2wt1s,1579528994.0,It’s different depending on the guy. Some guys stilll got it then and some don’t.

Bald spots"
trippinthroughtime,ff1qzoo,t1_ff1q0al,1579484258.0,I wish I still lived somewhere where I could get a durian
me_irl,feo4dba,t1_feo2ujd,1579295003.0,"Yes I agree. I’m not saying it was a bad idea, just that it was a bad book"
me_irl,fenxy11,t1_fent25g,1579292498.0,I just failed to care enough about Winston’s sex life. I thought the other parts of the book were good
me_irl,fenlors,t1_fenebgn,1579287356.0,1984 was a boring as fuck book. Ok it was a “good” book but it was really slow and kindof painful to read. It is good for a literature class but I can’t imagine it being anyone’s favorite book unless they are just trying to seem smart

LetsNotMeet,fen2cr1,t1_femvln2,1579275422.0,From this story I am 110% sure whatever that guy told the cops was not the truth. That guy probably knew what he was doing would get him in trouble so he just lied off his ass to make you seem like the bad guy and the cops fell for it. He probably said he just got out of his car to nicely ask you what your deal was and then said your fiancé pulled the gun for no reason. Or something like that
LetsNotMeet,fen1743,t1_femouut,1579274677.0,Seems like something angry Dwight would do to Michael and I just immediately thought it was an office reference
whitepeoplegifs,feldkjy,t1_fekrodc,1579219666.0,I’m in the US but I haven’t owned a tv in years so I can’t say whether it’s on or not
beholdthemasterrace,fekvnek,t1_fekvgqx,1579208541.0,Is he being given an incentive to come foreword? If I am understanding this right it seems like a weird thing for him to do
beholdthemasterrace,fektkbt,t3_epnqlj,1579207312.0,I’m OOTL. Can you tell me who these people are?
beholdthemasterrace,fekt789,t1_fdio9ur,1579207097.0,Well since trump hasn’t been president for **that** long this tattoo must be **relatively** new but it’s so faded it looks like 20 years old. So it could be fairly unintelligible eventually. But idk bc it’s not all that detailed.
beholdthemasterrace,feksxi3,t1_fdibg2f,1579206939.0,I see part of a swastika and a flaming skull
imveryedgy,fekp5o5,t1_fekjusc,1579204710.0,Why not both
nextfuckinglevel,feko28t,t1_fekm02i,1579204062.0,Yeah there’s lots of other subs to post stuff on. All you’re gonna get on r/toptalent are a bunch of angry comments
agedlikemilk,fek4fky,t1_fek4dmd,1579192388.0,Hmmm
agedlikemilk,fek4bwp,t1_fek2zoh,1579192326.0,Whoa your first comment was not a “no” it was about anti Vaxxers so you are not only NOs

pics,fefzbf5,t1_fefza0z,1579070397.0,Yeah I just heard about him last weekend so it is fresh in my mind... sorry
WatchPeopleDieInside,feftycz,t1_feft9cu,1579065113.0,I would never wear my glasses on rides. Being blind is better than losing your glasses
