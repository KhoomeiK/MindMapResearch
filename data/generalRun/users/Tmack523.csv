PoliticalCompassMemes,fgjuoat,t1_fgje25d,1580851734.0,"Right, but Bernie Sanders is the only politician I've ever known who wants to do something about it and has not taken any money from those drug companies. Do you not feel like if something were to be done about it, he's currently the best option to do so?

I also don't see how the government regulating the price of life saving medication like insulin would make it more expensive somehow? They already do this with things like milk, and I mean, milk has never been more than like $5 a gallon maximum. They do it with gasoline as well, and America has some of the lowest gas prices in the world. Im just saying, I think lowering restrictions with an already established corporate oligarchy will just give more power to that corporate oligarchy. They don't/won't just remove competition through the means the government provides, haven't you heard of Rockefeller? There are plenty of tactics a massive entrenched company can use to destroy their competition before it ever gets off the ground that don't involved government intervention. With no regulations whatsoever, they absolutely would just do that.

I mean, in regards to insulin in particular, it's so expensive in America *because* there are no regulations on it. In countries where insulin is already regulated by the government, it's much cheaper than in America. Plus, I don't really see how regulations could be removed any further. The only applicable rule I know of is the one where once a drug it's patented, no one else can produce it for like 20 years because it ""promotes the free market."" I think that regulation should be removed for sure, because it doesn't actually promote the free market. It allows the monopolizing company to inflate the price as much as they want, which is the root of this problem in my opinion.

I like the pvp aspect, but sometimes with a glitchy ass game where you only play solo and other people roll with squads, you can be in situations where the only option is to die or leave. I'm not going to go down in a firefight I'm *guaranteed* to lose because that's how some people think I should play the game. I fight 1v1 all the time, because that's fair and fun. But if there are multiple people running in a PSN chat together who have boxes buried across the map, bases, game-breaking party chat communication, and I'm just playing solo, it's just the smart move to leave.

I'm not saying I don't fight people. I've already died dozens of times to fighting in game, and have killed plenty as well, and it's whatever. I'm just saying, sometimes you gotta know when to hold em and when to fold em. 

I don't see how people using duplication, out of game party chat, the Izurvive app, (or honestly the internet in general for recipes and tactics and whatnot), respawning multiple times to farm for loot in high tier loot areas, using smurf accounts, or any of the other abuses of game mechanics that players talk about all the time, is different from server hopping when you know you couldn't survive in a situation."

Let's try to summarize things here because interacting with you is painful.

So you agree that there is more punishment for threatening than calling names, because it's law and common sense. I mean, you understood the logic of my analogy and applied it to cops instead of middle schoolers.

You can call a cop a ""pedophile"" or a ""maggot pig fucker all [you] want"". You could call him any name you want without being punished for it, even with no evidence or behaviors indicative that they are a pedo or maggot pig fucker. We have agreed on that.

But you can't threaten to rape a cop. If you do that, there are legal repercussions, as we have BOTH now stated. 

So NOW you're saying they're not the same thing and one is worse than the other. 

But that's not what you've BEEN saying. 

Earlier, you JUST said that you'd rather be threatened of rape than be called a pedophile. Maybe that's a personal thing about secretly feeling like people would believe you're a pedophile... Or you just believe you couldn't be raped... but either way I think we've both illustrated that there's an agreed upon societal picture where threats are worse than name calling.  That's the theme of everything we have discussed thus far.

Threats of violence and rape, as I've said MANY TIMES to your dense ass, is one of the things the right frequently delves into that the left doesn't. Which is why I think the right is worse."

TheRightCantMeme,ffrqjww,t1_ffpikff,1580163603.0,"Well, honestly that's the dumbest take I've ever heard in my life. I'm gonna guess you've never been really threatened with rape, and you're just incapable of empathising with those who have been. I mean... A threat is way worse than calling someone a name. Doesn't matter the threat or the name. ""Rapist"", ""cunt juggler"", ""pedophile"" versus ""I'm gonna kill you"" ""I'm gonna rape you"" 
I don't believe in many things being objectively true, but not seeing one of those is worse than the other... Seriously that's so stupid it hurts a bit.

To put it as simply as possible for you, let me draw an analogy.

In my public middle school, if you called another kid a curse word or something else mean/offensive you got a day of in school suspension. Didn't matter what you said, that was the punishment. That was the ""no tolerance"" policy for that. N-word, Pedo, rapist, you name it. Middle schoolers knew all that shit.

However, if you said something like ""I'm gonna kill you"" or ""I'm gonna rape you""  or another threat of violence (even jokingly) you would get three days of in school suspension, two days of out of school suspension, and you had to go under advisement of the principal (typically for further punishment). That was the mandated ""no tolerance"" policy for ""terroristic threats or threats of violence"". 

So, in short, *middle school aged children* in my particular state in the United States were meant to understand that *THREATENING* someone is worse than calling someone a *NAME*.

I hopefully don't have to explain why."
TheRightCantMeme,ffq3pti,t1_ffphv0b,1580118750.0,"I think it really depends on the individual. Like, for a lot of them they still *desire* women (in an objectifying way, perhaps). But because they still *desire* women, they don't necessarily manifest in their own minds that they resent women. 

So if you asked them if they hate women, they'd say something to the effect of ""no way, I want to fuck women"". Which is why I said low-key."
TheRightCantMeme,ffp7xss,t1_ffp2jr0,1580088474.0,"Well first off, this is a political sub designed to make fun of the right. It's MADE for shit slinging. You're here to see shit slinging. So like, that's just not a very valid argument here.

I also agree pedophile and rapist etc. should be used with discretion. But concerning yourself with the genitalia and sex life of a 16 year old girl is *by definition* pedophile indicative behavior. If she isn't your daughter, you shouldn't be worried about who she's dating and if she's had/having sex or not. If she's making a *political statement* and you dislike her *statements*, SAY THAT. Don't draw her getting spanked and say she needs to get a good dicking down. 
If she's over 18, that behavior would make you a fucking creep, and a woman could likely issue a restraining order on you just for saying shit like that. But when a girl is under 18, you're not just some creep, you're now *by definition* acting like a pedophile. Just facts. Pedophilic behaviors are a thing. You don't have to actual get to the point of touching kids to ""officially"" be designated a pedo.

I also pretty heavily disagree that the left has insults equally vile and equal in numeric volume to the right. I mean, ""rape AOC"" was a meme for a while. The far-right regularly produces memes for neo-nazis that celebrate ethnic cleansing. This has bled into slogans of the regular right, which are typically violent calls to action. ""Lock her up"" ""grab her by the pussy"" then all the memes with them holding guns looking intimidating, memes talking about deporting people, memes that use that lady outside the school shooting to represent ""crying snowflakes""

Whereas the worst I've seen from the left is the ""eat/hang the rich"" meme, which isn't even meant to be literal. It's a statement about their actual value to society in relevance to their economic displacement above other classes. That's a direct cry against economic inequality. It's saying eat them because they'd be more valuable as food than as the rich parasites they tend to be. 

The other memes I see from the left reference events or statements by right wing politicians that illustrate racist, sexist, or otherwise bigoted viewpoints. In each of the cases I can think of, it's not mud slinging, it's calling the character of an individual into question using evidence. ""Moscow mitch"" ""epstein didn't kill himself"" ""Trump is a crook""

Other times the left is attempting to unify, and excluding anti-fa (which could be considered far-left, and would be the left equivalent of far-rights Neo-Nazis) that unification abhors violence. ""Women's march"" ""#RESIST"" ""he will not divide us"" 

The ones I see from the right attack people based off their identity a lot, and then depict themselves as the victims. Stuff like ""Trump is defending our right to say Christmas"", ""AOC was a bar tender"", ""Bernie Sanders Is A Millionaire"", ""that senate bitch wears an islam scarf, she's gotta be a traitor to the country"" etc etc. Then there's the prominent FOX news spin; ""Trump heroically drone struck and killed Iranian general"" ""Obama human monster for drone strikes in middle east with civilian casualties"" In general, stuff that celebrates painting left-wing politicians as two dimensional bad guys without looking deeper. Stuff that clings to identity politics and always boils down to ""right good, left bad"" 

There's a big difference in the intention and effect of both of those, and I don't think the left is the problem."

Why? because they're obsessed with what a 16 year old girl wants to do with her genitalia. If you don't see how that's creepy pedo behavior, there's not really any discussion to be had with you. It's true, she's 16 not 6. But the fact stands she's 16 not 18. Ben Garrison is taking a page from Shadman's book by drawing an underage girl getting spanked like that, and Shadman isn't exactly a role-model.

Octane's speed doesn't make him as fast as pathfinder's grapple, and it sacrifices some health with each use. Pathfinder is the only hero that can go from the floor to the roof in a building without jumping and that is a stupidly massive advantage when coupled with a player with good situational awareness and no other heroes designed to counter that playstyle.

Baby boomers are equally male and female, because all of that shit is caused by the X or Y chromosome in the sperm cell when forming the zygote. These are just facts man, I shouldn't need to be giving you a sex ed class right now. Learn some actual science and don't believe everything you see on YouTube."

clevercomebacks,ffggzh0,t1_fffjhi3,1579906018.0,"You're pretty much pointing out why I have difficulty acknowledging him as an intelligent person. He always argues from a flawed premise. Doing so is a sign of ignorance if he's unaware how flawed his statements are. If he is aware of the flaws in his arguments but continues to argue them for money, which I don't believe, but you both seem to. Then I suppose he may be intelligent, just an extra shitty and selfish person."
clevercomebacks,ffgggdc,t1_fffo5iw,1579905675.0,"I'm sure you know a ton of Harvard graduates as well. Perhaps graduating from a particular university doesn't define you as intelligent or not and is more of a metric of your class. Perhaps he just has plenty of resources from his parents to enter into and pay for Harvard. I only went to a regular private college, which is no Harvard, but I knew a LOT of ignorant people that became educated in one subject, and now walk through life as a dumbass with a bachelor or even master's degree. 

All I'm saying is a piece of paper that says ""you're educated in this particular field"" doesn't magically make you intelligent. I think someone else stated it really well when they said he was knowledgeable. A degree informs you, but it cant make you think differently or more critically."

They just say something that dismantles his previous point, then he jumps into buzz words and provocative topics until he finds an escape route."

But to me *intelligent* implies a deeper more abstract type of critical thought. His clinging to identity politics, and his general presentation of actual arguments never strike me as particularly well thought out. Many times he has a script, or a team, or a long period of time to think of a retort behind a screen. When he is put into a situation where he has to interact with a smart person who disagrees with him, who doesn't respond in the scripted manner he expects... Well he escapes that situation most of the time."

dndmemes,ffa5goj,t1_ffa0vds,1579728258.0,"Makes sense! I feel like there is a bit less of a defined metric for attractive men as well. A lot of women like tall guys, but not all of them. Some like muscular guys, others like thin men, others like chubbier ones. Some like hairy, some like hairless, some like certain facial structures, hair colors, skin colors etc. 

With women, I feel like there's the whole cultural standard of beauty thing so there's more of a ""rubric"" to follow. Not saying only certain women are attractive, I'm just saying I think there's more of a culturally imposed idea of ""this is what makes a physically attractive woman"" than there is for a man. For men it's more like ""you must provide resources and/or have specific personality traits."""

worldnews,ff8332v,t1_ff80iiz,1579664696.0,"While I understand that perspective, the issues is that he doesn't seem to actually have the numbers to base it off of. Like, if he had thirty properties of different values in NYC, he'd have a stable window to gauge his metric of worth. Further, you just can't run any business with all of your assets tied up in forms that take forever to liquidate, like property. He'd have to have a set amount of savings and/or spending money that wouldn't be fluctuating. Then, even with fluctuating prices of property, he'd still have a minimum net worth that wouldn't change very much except for extreme events like 9/11. Of course he picked that example as well. I think what he's doing is attempting to paint a narrative where it's just impossible to try to put a number on his net worth so he can keep fucking around with other people's wealth behind closed curtains."
