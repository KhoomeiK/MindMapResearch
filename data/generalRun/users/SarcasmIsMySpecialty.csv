Most of the time I hold my tongue around them but something happened while I was cooking and I said “shit” and they were like “What was that?” As if there’s no appropriate time. I don’t use those words at work, around professors, or in professional situations. I don’t do it at church, around my grandparents, or children (I don’t know what their parents want) but lord have mercy I nearly chopped off my finger I think that warrants a strong word."

EngineeringStudents,fenkjaj,t3_eq3p4g,1579286655.0,"I have a spreadsheet template I use. I put in all my assignments (all that I can) with their due dates, exam dates, etc. I separate them by week and cross them off when they are done. It’s really satisfying, and I can plan ahead when I know I’ll have a particularly busy week. 

Start working on things as soon as you can. Do it while the material is fresh in your mind so you can solidify the knowledge. However, don’t forget to take a break when you need it. You can’t go nonstop and not get burnt out. 

Even if you think you’re just fine for a test, study as if there’s a good chance you’ll fail. You know you won’t, but keep studying. Take the day of the test off, if you can. It gives hour brain a break to digest the information and not get overwhelmed. 

Figure out which resources work best for you and do it early on. I know that Professor Leonard lectures work great for me. I know that working from my textbook is difficult for math classes. I figured out my TA was a wealth of knowledge and patience for my surveying class last semester, while the textbook was confusing and the professor was difficult. Figure out what works best, and stick with it. 

Find your spot. Your study spot. It helps. Establish that routine and ride it out through the semester. That stability can be really nice when things get crazy later on."
EngineeringStudents,femwsb4,t3_epywjt,1579271649.0,"I have several friends in my department who struggled in some of our classes last semester. I am a student who learns best by teaching. I want to see everyone succeed, and if I can help them, I do all I can. That usually results in me working extra hard outside of class to learn the material really well so I can teach them in a way they understand without just giving them answers. You might have a friend who is like this. 

Please try not to be afraid of asking for help, especially from your peers. You’re all in the same boat trying to get through the courses and do well."

I wouldn’t call is “friends” but more like friendly acquaintances that happen to love in the same apartment. We don’t go out of our way to hang out, and we kinda just do our own thing, and that’s okay. That may be the case with your roommate. Some people are just focused on other things.

college,fdh779q,t3_eldvcn,1578416867.0,"According to [this](https://nscresearchcenter.org/signaturereport11/#Sig11-Discussion-2) it takes students an average of 5.1 years to finish a bachelors degree. At my school specifically (STEM focused school), MANY students take 5-6 years, sometimes factoring in semester internships. I will be in school a minimum of five years, not factoring in semester internships, so you’re not alone in this. Try not to stress about this too much.

Finishing in good standing is way better than rushing through it and doing poorly due to course load and stress. Employers don’t normally care. If they ask about it in interviews, be honest, but most only care that you have your degree and can do what they want you to be able to do.
