They were clearly the main instigator, though. The blame lays mainly on the Naziâ€™s, because their aggressive expansionism forced the rest of the European powers to react.

However, the Soviets definitely share part of the blame for allying with the Naziâ€™s early on and enabling the invasion of Poland. At least they did eventually put down the Naziâ€™s, at a devastatingly great cost. Although, I would have preferred that they also overthrew and hanged Stalin right after."

Historically, there has been little difference between the fascists and communists in outcome. You get an oppressive totalitarian dictatorship with little economic gain to show for it. The main difference is whether the ""mAsTeR rAcE"" or ""wOrKeRs UnItE!"" religious bullshit that comes with it.
