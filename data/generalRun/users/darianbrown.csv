delusionalcraigslist,ffghc5n,t3_etc5bl,1579906242.0,"This car starts at $58k, depending on the options, it could be much more. He's overpriced, but not drastically. It's worth around 20-30k salvage value."

Wellthatsucks,ffdwtka,t1_ffdwdu4,1579830888.0,"I work as an IT guy in CID schools for the army. I've seen the investigations of stuff like this, they use it as examples, pictures hung on the walls. Adults choke on plastic bags, Saran wrap, balloon fragments at a fairly shocking rate. EVER covering a person's face with a thin plastic material is an absolutely idiotic idea. It's not like walking, it's unnecessary and involuntary, and could end up killing someone for a cheap joke."

AskReddit,fe3t07v,t1_fe3lu3g,1578852621.0,"This is true. Consider the price of replacement vs price of parts. If you could buy a multipurpose tool to fix it at the same price, buy the tool. If you use it twice, you've saved money. Parts, though, those are just one time use usually."
AskReddit,fe3snfp,t1_fe3ma2e,1578852515.0,"Depending on the mattress, wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. We used to pressure wash all upholstery we took out of cars with boiling water and soap, then just boiling water."

facepalm,fdm9g2c,t1_fdm9cq4,1578543131.0,"Both. It's crazy how dangerous electric ranges are (though the top has some decent fireproofing), and the aluminum instead of using steel is just a bad idea in general. Steel pans with layers of copper are life changing if you cook at least once a year."
facepalm,fdm7zdm,t1_fdm7uyr,1578542048.0,"That as well, yes. When using my foundry, I have a kid with no insulation, but just the steel being on there reflecting the heat back down to the crucible is the difference in getting hot enough to melt brass with just charcoal."
facepalm,fdm7dem,t1_fdm7brh,1578541609.0,"That's fair. It would shut it off in any event of fire or overheating burner though, which would be pretty primary concerns"

facepalm,fdm6i6l,t1_fdltz3k,1578540992.0,"Around 1200° for aluminum, which, despite what some people are saying, many cheap and older electric ranges are more than capable of producing when the pan isn't transferring heat into anything inside"

facepalm,fdm6cf8,t1_fdltn7r,1578540876.0,"They are not thermally regulated on stoves like that, only regulated by their ability to radiate away heat. When the normal convection is gone and they just sit there under a pan, they can reach ridiculously hot temperatures up to around 1500° Fahrenheit. More than enough to melt aluminum. I've seen it happen and repaired the stove."
facepalm,fdm60ms,t1_fdlzot0,1578540647.0,"It's aluminum, 100% certain. I've fixed a stove this happened to before."
facepalm,fdm5y0r,t1_fdm2od3,1578540596.0,"It's not a plastic pot, it is aluminum. Those burners get more than hot enough to melt it without water getting rid of the excess energy via steam."
facepalm,fdm5vht,t1_fdm43ou,1578540546.0,"Yes, you are correct. I have repaired a stove this happened to before."
facepalm,fdm5t5k,t1_fdm5co5,1578540500.0,"This is the correct answer. Aluminum pan melted over the burner. Luckily, that entire portion of the stove is easily and pretty cheaply replaced, assuming no serious damage to the connector for the burner was done."
