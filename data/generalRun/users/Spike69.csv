Sgt. Bergdahl was released after nearly five years of captivity in Afghanistan as part of a May 31 (2014) exchange for five Taliban detainees held at a U.S. military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

The GAO said ""The Department of Defense violated section 8111 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2014 when it transferred five individuals detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the nation of Qatar without providing at least 30-days notice to certain congressional committees."" The department also violated another law that prohibits federal employees from spending money not authorized by Congress. ""DOD should report its Antideficiency Act violation as required by law.""

The department countered that providing notice ""would have interfered with the executive's performance of two related functions that the Constitution assigns to the president: protecting the lives of Americans abroad and protecting U.S. service members."" Also, ""We were concerned about Sgt. Bergdahl's health.""

Basically the GAO says the Pres has to ask permission to go outside and buy ice cream from the truck but the pres said that if he went inside to ask permission the ice cream man would have driven away already.

It is my personal opinion that while Obama is technically/legally in the wrong.  I however don't see any steps for rectification listed in [the bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2397/text).  The GOA said ""you can't do that"", he said ""but I wanted to"" and presidential authority went unchecked that day as far as I can tell.  Now Trump has violated even more egregiously the update 2019 version of that same Bill and it seems to me that it is up to Congress to decide his punishment."
