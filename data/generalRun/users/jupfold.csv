Really close resemblance though!"
Brogress,felfs44,t1_fek4e3x,1579221140.0,"Please don’t start on the 20th. Monday’s are so busy at the gym. It’s demotivating and hard to have a good workout. Most people quit because they only ever go on Monday’s in January and think that’s how it always is. Go this Saturday, you’ll have a way better time."

jobs,fejizze,t3_epcfed,1579176319.0,"Generally I would suggest to keep it simple. There are a lot of gimmicky things you could do, but most corporate world presentations will be based around a few slides in a power point. You could base it around a demonstration, an activity or a group discussion, but I think most interviewers are looking more toward the PowerPoint route. 

I personally would put together a few slides, 3-4 for 15-30 minutes, maybe more if you’re expected to present for longer. 

Stay away from gimmicky things like transitions, animations, lots of pictures. Focus more on charts, graphs, numbers, etc. Stay away from overly wordy slides - you should memorize and speak to those talking points instead. 

Definitely make sure you are confident, outgoing and professional. Make sure you think of questions they might ask and think of your responses. If you don’t have an answer, the correct response is ‘I don’t know the answer to that, but I will find out and follow up’. Don’t hem and haw for an answer on the spot that might be incorrect. 

Full discretion, this is from my experience, and different jobs and industries might differ. A sales role will definitely want to see your sales pitch. A software job may want you to go through code or a flowchart. An education or HR position might want a more activity based and round table type presentation. Tailor yours to the appropriate crowd. Good luck!"

OP is simply saying there is a discrepancy between the job title and what the job actual entails. You likely wouldn’t need to go for an interview to determine that, but still annoying."
Fitness,fdgkma9,t1_fdgjfhn,1578400475.0,"I’m not changing the goalposts so you can’t win the argument. 

I’m simply making a completely different argument than you are. I actually agree with you that a fast food burger can be made healthy. Please understand that. 

If you’ll go back and kindly read my first comment, my argument is that the advice to go get a fast food burger without cheese would never be the TOP choice (key word ‘top’). 

Go ask 100 dieticians and I guarantee you that less than 2-3% of them will say that their TOP recommendation for an individual coming to them would be to go get a burger from a fast food joint and remove the cheese. 

The vast majority of dieticians would say their top recommendation would be to make your own food at home. You cannot argue against that."
Fitness,fdgilhy,t1_fdgicx3,1578398319.0,"You’re really pulling at threads here. If you wanna get into super specifics like ‘well what if I added more salad’ or ‘what if I did this’. 

GENERALLY SPEAKING, a homemade, healthy, packed lunch, is going to win out over a fast food burger. 

Yes, you can made tidbit changes to the scenario to make the fast food burger more healthy, but we’re talking in general terms here."
Fitness,fdghsip,t1_fdghire,1578397372.0,"I’m not doubting that you can lose weight and even be healthy by having a Big Mac without the bad trimmings. I remember the researcher who lost a bunch of weight on the ‘Twinkie diet’. I’m simply pointing out that no dietician would say that this is the BEST option for someone. Clearly a homemade, healthy, packed lunch is almost always going to be better."
Fitness,fdgfjo6,t1_fdfy85w,1578394470.0,"How is this not the top answer? Seriously, the top answer in a fitness forum is to buy a Big Mac with no cheese?? What the fuck r/fitness. What the fuck."
