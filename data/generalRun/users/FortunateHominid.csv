Good lord. Most Republicans I know don't even care for Trump as a person. They do agree with most of his policies though and that's the reason they will vote for him. More so when compared to policies being proposed by current democrat candidates.

Worth noting his approval rating has increased with independents as well."

Have you seen the approval ratings for that speech? Not to mention the latest Gallup poll regarding his current approval rating? Pelosi didn't do anything but give Republicans a good clip for the upcoming elections.

Also it wasn't just about the app but the much lower turnout than they expected.

The impeachment attempt isn't even worth getting into. The second Dems took the house everyone new it was coming since they've been stating as much since 2016. The outcome was expected as well. It was a bad play imo that actually hurt them. They would have been better off going for censure."
politics,fggmhfw,t1_fggh6zv,1580764940.0,"Due to deductions and tax brackets some people receive all of their federal taxes paid on their return (so effectively 0 fed taxes paid). Sometimes they will even receive back more than they paid in. 

There are also tax credits people can file for during tax season even if they didn't work or  pay any federal taxes. They still can receive a ""return"" for said credits with no monies paid in.

I never mentioned size, only population. Yet if you wish to include size that does have an effect as well. Not every area is densely populated. So that means increased monies necessary for public services due to logistics. As for states they can be extremely diverse. States can vary regarding income, needs, necessary spending, unemployment, median income, population density, GDP, ect.

It's far more complicated than simply more people = more taxes. That's why some like myself are for a flat tax which can even be adjusted based on income brackets. Remove deductions and it would simplify our tax system greatly. You made X dollars so you pay Y dollars, period.

I don't have a dog in this fight right now as I'm not a registered Democrat. Just giving the opinion of someone looking in from the outside.

Desirability is up to individual needs/wants. It also has to be affordable. Desirable and affordable don't have to be mutually exclusive. It cost more because California politicians keep pushing legislation to block building new homes to drive up prices. That's not common everywhere. Cost of living and lower priced homes (and lower taxes) is one of the reasons so many Californians are moving to Texas. 

>And don’t pretend like high taxes are a bad thing, that’s how you address all the other issues

Depends on how the monies are spent. No point in raising taxes if you are going to continue wasteful spending. I prefer lower taxes with more prudent spending as opposed to bloated unsuccessful/unneeded government programs. 

>Californians get a lot of great public services for that money, such as the homeless shelters that take care of the bussed in homeless from other states.

There's one example. Where are all the homeless shelters and programs given the high homeless rate? 

Also the majority are not bussed in. Most there lived in California prior to becoming homeless.

If you still feel just as tired or more than it's more likely due to other reasons. Over a year is far more than enough to get used to the equipment. Your AHI is lowered so sleep apnea is no longer the primary issue.

You're right it's not a magic pill and there are many factors involved.

I don't know about you but to most people being involved in an auto accident severe enough to possibly kill someone would be extremely significant. Definitely not something easily forgotten. Many people get shaken up just from a fender bender.

As for the cop, police deal with people lying to them on a daily basis. Sometimes they use tactics to get around such. In this case he could have assumed if they told him he they thought he was a suspect in a more serious accident elsewhere that night and his reaction would have been normal. Either denies and/or lawyers up or confess to other accident to show he wasn't at the first.

Cops deal with people lying to them daily so they sometimes try and flush info out of people. Routines like good cop bad cop for example have been used for a long while now. There is no way they could have anticipated the guy was unstable enough to commit suicide as that's far from the norm. They can't operate based on the anomalies.

False memories? How much time did these cops spend with the guy and over how many days? A conversation or two isn't close to enough time to plant doubts unless there were other major factors involved. That's exactly why some people are assuming he was under the influence. Occams razor and all.
