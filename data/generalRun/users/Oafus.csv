We got handled by Baltimore, but for want of some red zone failings and a pathetic offensive display, we could have very easily beat the Titans. The space time football continuum demanded Baltimore dismantle Tennessee and prove that yes, our failing was correct and all is as it should be because Lamar Jackson and the Ravens.    
But now shit is upside down because if, in my head, we should have beat the Titans, and they beat the Ravens, then OBVIOUSLY we would have beat the Ravens last night.
