That could be the problem.  The dye used on the discs is so old it's not as reliable as a newer disc (the dye is what the information is ""burned"" onto on the disc). CD-R discs generally are meant to [last about ten years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-R#Lifespan) (if they do, great, but don't always count on it).

It could have somehow been the car accident, maybe they got impacted or something, I don't know.  CD-R discs have never been as reliable as factory pressed discs , always more fragile.  Also could have been exposed to light for too long, no CD should spend time in the sun for long periods. 

 Also, high heat and humidity is very bad for CD's, so if the car sat baking in the sun with the CD-R's in the car, that could've caused them to malfunction.

Anyway, I always use a CD wallet for CD-R discs, that's a better way to store them. Or put the paper sleeves in a zippered sleeve or bag, to keep the light out."

iphonehelp,fcxg0l8,t1_fcwm0n3,1578061965.0,"Buying refurbished is a risk, you don’t know how good it will work, but that’s what why it’s good to purchase from places with good reviews, good return policies and warranties.    

Also, the refurbished sellers test the devices before selling them, it’s not in their best interest to sell things that don’t work ( if they’re legitimate businesses) . Ideally they will replace or refund your device if you got a lemon.  It’s better than buying a “used” device from some dude on eBay or Craigslist, because the device has been tested to make sure it works, you can at least get a warranty or have a return policy.  

And with phones it’s important to know (or has some guarantee) it isn’t a blocked device that can’t be activated on cell networks.  Some have a bad IMEI number that’s been blacklisted by the phone companies.


   As for choosing between devices, You might check if the seller can tell you what the battery health percentage is on the device.  I noticed phones with better battery health were listing at a higher price on Swappa.  Not every seller lists the battery health though.   On BackMarket there’s no way to tell, they just promise the battery has at least 80% health.  

  I got a good price on my device, so i didn’t mind paying for a new battery after I got it.

It worked immediately with my SIM card and transferred my apps and iCloud info from my other iphone.  I decided to get a new battery installed a couple weeks after I bought it, though, because the battery health was already at 82% when I got it and it dipped down to 80% after a couple weeks.  i probably could’ve gotten by without replacing it, but it works better with a new battery.   

  The Apple service place I took it to made sure I had recently backed it up on iCloud before they would service it, I think it’s a precaution thing, they didn’t have to wipe my phone or reset it at all to change the battery.


BackMarket guarantees phones to have at least 80% battery health and have a one month full return policy (if you don’t like it or there’s a problem and it doesn’t work) plus the year long warranty.   Swappa offers a similar longer warranty for a separate fee.

Both Swappa and Bavkmarket guarantee phones/devices to be in good working order with everything functioning on them.  

The  grading system they use (Mint, Fair, Good, Excellent, etc) refers only to the *cosmetic* condition.  So even if you buy a phone in Fair condition, it should functionally work as well as a phone in Mint condition, it’ll just have more scratches or dings on it. So you can save money if you don’t mind some scratches.  

 I don’t personally trust eBay for phones, but you might just check reviews of the sellers, see if they are legit.  They may not have good return policies or a warranty like the refurbished sites, or it might be stolen or under a contract still."
