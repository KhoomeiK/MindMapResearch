AbruptChaos,ff3tamo,t1_ff3rpei,1579548385.0,"It's a carry over from an older era mainly. The census started recording race way back in the early days of the country when slavery and racial discrimination was legal. Over time we just never ended up getting rid it. There are ways that it's still useful in the modern day though. Different races in America are subject to different struggles and issues, so having more specific information about people's races can help in combatting said issues. For instance, black kids in America tend to have worse access to quality public education than white kids. Knowing which areas in the country have a significant black population can help us see where new schools are needed in order to address the problem.

Recording peoples races may sound incredibly odd and regressive to non-Americans (and even some Americans), but I'm of the opinion that it's a necessary evil. At least in the short term. America has a unique history of racial politics, and so we have racially charged issues that a lot of other countries don't have to account for."

Graham is another excellent point of how Caesar ignores the own failings of his own philosophy when they're not convenient for him. He doesn't see his first failure at Hoover Dam through the lens of Hegelian Dialectics. He just says its Graham's fault, kills him, and tries again almost the exact same way.

The skill set for the former doesn't necessarily transfer over to the latter, though Caesar is unbelievably confident that it will for some reason.

Also how exactly is Caesar taking any of the best aspects of the NCR? For example, the NCR's snipers were one of the biggest reasons why he lost the First Battle of Hoover Dam, and by the second battle he still doesn't do anything to prevent them. Even if you fight the battle on the Legion's side, a Legionare will tell you that the snipers are still shooting them like fish in a barrel and they rely on the Courier to take care of the snipers for them.

Caesar does not allow anyone outside the military to have a role in the operation of the Legion, and all of the people in the military learn nothing but war and are all invariably killed before they can even reach late adulthood.

Compare that then to Phasma who was very much advertised and pushed as being something more than what she turned out to be.

The Uighurs ARE the local society. Like I said before, they are the natives to the region. Han Chinese culture/language is the national culture.

> They hypothesize that radicalism stems from an inability to socially adapt and a lack of social and financial opportunity. This causes them to search for salvation in other methods.

Which is an admirable goal. Unfortunately the Chinese government has decided to try and reach it by force. Instead of merely offering the Uighurs an opportunity to broaden their economic prospects, they're ignoring the Uighurs' agency and are just forcing them to do it. Likely because they believe this method to be more expedient. That is what makes this whole thing imperialist.

> But the true sticking point is what ideas does the West have for reducing radicalism? Use weapons and destroy them?

This is whataboutism. The West is very much hypocritical and deserving of criticism for its own actions. That does not give China a free check to act somewhat less terribly though. Nothing is stopping us from criticizing both the West and China. I refuse to cosign China's actions for the same reason that I refuse to cosign the War of Terrorism. If the BRI is so important to China, then they can find a way to complete it that doesn't involve forcing the natives into camps.

> It's pretty difficult to invade another country when they actively wish to merge with your military.

Except now the Chinese Civil War has ended and the current situation is different from the past situation. If you were to go back in time and tell the government of East Turkestan that merging with the PRC would mean having their people thrown into re-education camps against their will in the future, I'm sure they'd have re-evaluated their stance on the PRC and adjusted any deals they made with them accordingly.

At the end of the day what I take issue with is the fact that the Chinese government is choosing to force societal change at the expense of a minority population's agency. Their motivations for doing so could be pure as driven snow for all I care, but I'd still be against it because the action itself is still imperialist, and thus wrong, on principle.

Yes, China's right over the region is every bit as legitimate as the US's right to it's own land; which is to say that it's questionable. Still, expecting China to abandon the region is as unrealistic as expecting the US to abandon it's own land. This is why I never said that's what China should do. What isn't unrealistic is to expect China to not forcibly assimilate the people of a region that it took by force. If the US was wrong for it's own Indian Schools, then China is wrong for the Xinjiang education camps in turn. This isn't about pitting the US's legitimacy against China's. It's about calling out imperialism whenever and wherever I see it, and what's going on in Xinjiang is textbook imperialism.

> If that's the case, the current reservation system in the US is just like the camps over there.

Yes, which is a bad thing. The reservation system is the remnant of the US's imperialist crimes. We wouldn't tolerate the US taking any new land and building any new reservations in the modern day, so why are you tolerating China doing such. The reservations are an example of what to avoid; not what to imitate.

> Aside from that, China's history in the region goes much further than simply 1750s

And Italy's history used to include Egypt and Morocco. That doesn't mean that the modern day Italian state has any right to those countries, their people, or their resources, and if they ever claimed they did we'd decry them as imperialist. Ancient history is ancient history. What matters now is that the current state of China only gained control of Xinjiang in the 1750s, and that it did so by force. This was an imperialist action and now China is choosing to even further that imperialist action with its forced re-education camps.

Have you ever given pause to think about why we hardly ever donate human blood upon death? It's because blood clots when it isn't circulating.

If people continue to call guys like Lil Uzi Vert ""rappers"" then it's likely that ""soundcloud rap"" will continue to simply be viewed as a subgenre and not a separate genre entirely."
worldnews,fca20fc,t1_fca1uge,1577561838.0,"No you dumbass, I'm saying they'd never let someone like that become the Democratic nominee in the first place. Do you even know anything about how party politics work?"
HistoryMemes,fca1v58,t1_fc9odsn,1577561762.0,"Unironically this. Rock n Roll started in the late 1940s as a specific style of R&B, but gradually came to be considered a separate genre by the wider public over the course of the 1950s."
worldnews,fc9zabe,t1_fc9z01n,1577560441.0,"If a Democrat actually tried that they'd lose the female liberal vote in a heartbeat, which makes up a huge portion of the Democrat voting base. They'd never make it past the primaries."
animenocontext,fc9sq1i,t3_egr9qe,1577557650.0,I don't even know where to begin with this one...
architecture,fc5t7yq,t3_egb9zm,1577465345.0,It looks like concept art for a Final Fantasy game.
trippinthroughtime,fc4dwec,t3_eg2vzu,1577413843.0,I've always thought it interesting how pre-modern artists chose to display people of the past in contemporary fashion. It makes me wonder what a modern painting with that kind of choice would be like. Like a piece showing Jesus surrounded by SWAT officers or something.
manga,fc4707y,t1_fc46hhs,1577408324.0,"Most rom coms have more nuance to them than this chapter because this chapter is a parody, not an actual manga series that needs its own unique identity, characters, and premise.  If anyone tried to make a rom-com that hit every beat of this chapter, it probably would never get serialized in the first place. That doesn't mean that even the decent rom-coms don't still fall victim to at least one or two of the tropes shown in this parody though."
manga,fc45zke,t1_fc45ser,1577407533.0,Yeah no shit none of them are EXACTLY like this. It's an 9 page parody of an entire genre of manga. There's no way it would be able to accurately describe every last one of them. That doesn't change the fact that all of the manga I listed have a good deal of the tropes that this chapter is poking fun at.
manga,fc45u4k,t1_fc3wr7e,1577407417.0,Ishigami doesn't necessarily have to know that Hayasaka is Kaguya's maid irl to dream that she is.
manga,fc45n95,t1_fc444d8,1577407269.0,"> I never saw anything like that on Shonen Jump

What is Nisekoi? What is Bokuben? What is Yuragi-sou? What is To Love Ru?"
perfectlycutscreams,fc3z3du,t1_fc3ysk0,1577402357.0,"And there are plenty of other comments from people who clearly didn't see it as real. Not all of us have the same perspective. The difference being is that when something doesn't live up to my expectations I don't automatically whine about it. Had this post been titled something like ""I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY CAUGHT THIS ON CAMERA!"" You might have a point. But this post is as ambiguously titled as it could have been. Sorry the world doesn't revolve around your own preconceptions."
AskEurope,fc3ykwm,t1_fc3xjzl,1577401969.0,"I think it's just a matter of relativity. Frog legs may not be something that French people eat all that often, but it's undeniably more prevalent in French cuisine than in British cuisine where it's practically non existent."
perfectlycutscreams,fc3ygpq,t1_fc3xtsu,1577401881.0,Or you just assumed that it was and are blaming and 9 second clip for not being what you wanted it to.
perfectlycutscreams,fc3y9m8,t1_fc3xndp,1577401733.0,"That seems like it's more your problem for assuming that something was a candid moment when it wasn't. It's not like this sub is devoted to capturing candid moments and other things like the lighting of this clip also clearly implied that this wasn't a candid moment. Hell, the title of this post doesn't even imply that OP was trying to pass this off as candid."
AskEurope,fc3x0pe,t1_fc3waq2,1577400810.0,Are you telling me grenouilles are just one big anglo conspiracy then?
perfectlycutscreams,fc3wuw1,t1_fc3weux,1577400690.0,I don't see how that dimishes the humor. Most of the stories stand up comedians tell are made up or embellished and yet people never have a problem with them.
perfectlycutscreams,fc3rqn6,t1_fc3kq2k,1577396963.0,What is with people's obsession over shit being scripted? Most comedy in general is scripted.

Animemes,fc1mdqe,t1_fc1j2cg,1577323122.0,"Yeah, but even if you give an in-universe reason, resolving the major conflict of nearly every arc in your story the exact same way is just poor writing regardless."
AskEurope,fc1ku4f,t1_fc1ebuc,1577321775.0,Probably the fact that they eat frogs' legs.
worldnews,fc1ahuc,t1_fc1a0rz,1577312955.0,"You should stop being tolerant when someone is actually in danger. The Bible is not a person. Had these guys forced Christians to watch their work at gunpoint, then you'd have a reason to strike back at them. They didn't do that though. If the Bible is to be believed, then these comedians are bound for Hell anyway, so why should any follower of Christ waste their time and energy trying to punish them in the temporal world? Eternal punishment beyond their wildest imagination is awaiting them, is it not?"
