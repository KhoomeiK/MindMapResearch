college,ffrvnca,t3_eus7u6,1580166880.0,"I am a first year on campus student and on Friday I went to the emergency department at the teaching hospital. 14 hours later I was diagnosed with a hernia and need surgery sometime but not now. Loads of pain walking but I just have to deal with it. Today walking to class was difficult and my professor told me to go rest. I didn’t because I walked to go get my good grades. And I say in class. Yes I understand it sucks to be sick away from home and still having to do everything a normal college student does. I am thankful I have ONE single friend and a good roommate. It puts pressure on my social well-being too because I have aspergers. 

Thank you Alizay and Matt you both are great!"

Before or just after your baby is born create a brokerage account and invest $1000 into a simple index fund like the S&P500 his college expenses will be mostly paid for and will have a head start on retirement. Contribute 30 bucks a month (dollar a day) and let it grow.

aspergers,ffclbsq,t3_esszhn,1579801894.0,I find it really strange to jump right into a conversation if you have never talked before. Just say hello and introduce yourself. “Hello my name is billy I see you around here sometimes and wanted to say hi.” 99% of the time they will introduce themselves again. I don’t want to make it come across as I’m trying to get a date first thing. Let it be that and then next time you see her say hi sally! If on the other hand you have been talking for a while try offering something or take her to tea << change this to whatever fits.
aspergers,ffckpvn,t1_ffc8oh7,1579801526.0,For me I was born with it and I can’t change the fact I have it. It’s not worth my brain energy to think about changing it either.

aspergers,ff1088t,t3_er2wul,1579473993.0,Not diagnosis information but every single person with aspergers is different. We are wired differently in our brains and that can do unusual things. One of the wirings that was negativity affected for me was my hand coordination and I can’t handwrite but others have absolutely beautiful handwriting (With ASD). I was never interested in typical stuff as a kid and preferred to read a book about meteorology or something to that nature. I had meltdowns and knew people who didn’t. Just because you experience some but not all major “symptoms” does not change anything. Everyone is wired differently.

college,fdpnflq,t1_fdopwvn,1578633676.0,I appreciate your help. I am definitely more willing to transfer than I was before and hopefully I can figure this out. For now I dropped the class that was not going to work out for me and replaced it with an advanced Stat class I wanted to take. So some problems solved with mild action for now lets hope its not a stab wound covered up with a band-aid type situation.
college,fdod5ft,t1_fdnkfg0,1578602981.0,"Well, I wasn't sure when I first was applying that they would probably be so much better than what I am getting currently. I figured they would all have roughly the same rigor and requirements since looking at the basic requirement sheets for all of my original options remained relatively similar minus the courses I am ""required"" to take as a community college transfer with >45 but <90 credits. To answer if they offer a minor in finance or economics; Nope. Accounting/Marketing both would be the closest things offered at both.  Accounting is fine and all but limited courses in Economics/Finance and not exactly something I am interested in. 

I might look into neighboring state schools too and see what it would cost to attend."
college,fdni9i2,t1_fdndgn2,1578586370.0,"Well, one of your assumptions is at least correct. I got accepted into two schools better than the one I am in but chose not to go to them because they don't offer a finance or economics degree path. One is likely the second-best school in my state and the other is likely the third or fourth-best. Both have acceptance rates of 60-70%."

I am 22 now and after I graduated high school I straightened up. My other option is a second state college which is significantly more expensive. I'd like to major in a different field but from what I have seen nothing is around here with those kind of options :( I will definitely look into a tech school with a finance or economics major though.

Right now I only have to take 4 of the super dumb classes and about 5 other sorta dumb classes its these super dumb ones that make my blood boil.

One thing I’ve learned from myself and the dozens of other aspergians I know is that we are all different. Not one of us has the same wiring I feel.

aspergers,fczp0lx,t1_fcz9mem,1578106029.0,Yes. Start early and look at different providers. We (my family) found a local-ish non profit that trained for this specific “disability.” I remember talking to about 3 different ones. Not all dogs will be best for YOU and the provider should find the best fit for YOU and your family. The wait can be long or short and training will be the most stressful part. You as a handler will be trained the same or more than the dog (this is what I didn’t understand before starting). If you have more questions feel free to ask.

I was thinking about getting another dog a few years ago, but really feel my time has been greatly improved and can’t improve that much more. Hopefully getting internships and finishing college will go smoothly. Once I graduate and settle into a place of my own I will consider getting another specially trained dog but probably not one with the same resume as my current for working in public.

aspergers,fcwa1ag,t1_fcw8o7g,1578020594.0,"This dog doesn't get enough credit for how smart she is. My family has had several dogs including raising another that sadly didn't make it to become a service dog himself but is also really smart. I mean this in a few ways and I will share a couple examples. First Star (my service dog), has learned so many things like how to open doors (of various kinds) completely on her own without specific training. Second when I would get anxiety she would immediately notice and come over to me instead of running away. And lastly her ""Stay"" command is on point when we are in public. If I tell her to stay she will not move until we tell her and it doesn't matter what is going on around. 

I am sure I could have found a better answer and if I think of one I will try to post it. Typing this on my phone and while finishing packing for my move so apologies if grammar isn't up to my usual par.

TLDR: She is super super super smart compared to an average (smart) dog."
