If you get an equivilant amount of ice cubes vs the sphere then the cubes will have a higher surface area.  It's a ratio that slides up and down just depending among the amount of ice you add.  If you put in a smaller ice ball then the same amount of water in cube form will have a larger surface area, especially if it's multiple cubes. The more surface area exposed to the relatively warm liquid, the faster it melts. A large ball will have more surface area than a single normal icecube, it's not the same amount of water and so the ratio is not 1:1 which means the surface area can't be directly compared to each other unless the ratio is applied. You could measure this at home using water displacement.

All it takes is 1 thing to literally ruin someone's life.  It costs you nothing to realize that. You can have empathy and understand that the system may work for you but not for a majority of the populace. It was not too long ago when someone with a pre-existing illness could never switch insurance despite rising rates because they would not get accepted into another plan. They were the lucky ones who had insurance and were able to keep it because everyone else who was sick were screwed and forced to cover medical bills out of pocket.  Hospitals will literally try to get a poor patient healthy enough to walk out the door and nothing more, just so they can free up the bed/care they are taking in order to accommodate more profitable patients.  Even if the doctors know that someone needs more treatment, the administration can deny it on the grounds that the patient's insurance doesn't cover it or they are unable to afford it. In cases like this, it is common for the hospital to refuse to do anything about it (including preventative measures) until it becomes life threatening, regardless of that person's quality of life.

It's not anyone's fault and I get it, but it sucks to have to explain it every time.  I never know how they want it unless they specifically ask and they are all different. Most of the mistakes where they switch my name tends to be when they see it written down in my expierience.  They see Wolf, assume it's a first name, and then fill it in from there. That's my guess anyways.  Especially if the last name space comes before the first name.  Or if it's one of those single boxes but then they give you the required format of last, first."

trashy,fdcx9hn,t1_fdcsrv5,1578287009.0,"Ok, first off the attitude is uncalled for.  All you need to do is ask for clarification because I am not going to go through everyone's post history every time a comment appears.  That would be wierd. It also gives a very skewed perspective of a person anyways, unless your Reddit account is an accurate representation of your everyday life and dealings.

You are proving my point.  You are coming from one specific situation that was unique to you where you completely understand *your side* of the story.  Your whole post specifically refered to the hardships **you** had to face, not the hardships your **parents** faced. There are always two sides.  As I said, it's not black and white and it isn't as simple as just keeping in contact.  For one example, someone who is violent towards their family or vandalizes/steals everything they own can complicate these types of relationships. You are also making a pretty big assumption that a hug and an I love you are enough for that person and that they appreciate that rather than resents it, making it worse. Not saying that is the situation, but it is certainly a real possibility. In your situation it was was an immense source of comfort and I am sure you saw situations in which this was the opposite at some point. The relationship can be toxic or dependent to begin with and trying to repair it alone would be difficult let alone under the influence of drugs.

When I say ""you are not a part of it"" I am specifically talking about the unique situation that literally every one is in (including you). Nobody else besides you will ever truly understand the things that you have lived through and the relationship you maintain with your parents since you were an infant.  I say again, you will never fully understand *their* position since you haven't lived in *their* lives. You are also mitigating the sacrifices of the parents. Everyone can make their own decisions whether you agree with them or not and unless you are a part of the relationship their entire life then you will not see and feel what that person is feeling and thinking. All we can do is relate as best we can using our experiences to the highest degree possible.

Unless you think that every family that has to deal with drugs is the same, as your post implies? I am not mitigating whatever you have had to deal with and it's not a competition.  I am just pointing out that every situation is unique.  The nuances of human relationships are immeasurable and infinite.

 No need for insults, especially when you have no idea who you are talking to (as you acussed me of for some reason). Nobody is attacking you here. Glad that life worked out in the end and that you had supportive parents who were emotionally and financially stable enough to support you through it (even if it was rough or sacrifices had to be made to help you).  Just remember that not everyone has that and keep in mind that the mental wellness of the parents, and their ability to cope, takes a huge role as well and they want to be happy too. I am sure that dealing with stuff like this for seemingly year after year with no end in sight wears in so many ways on all parties involved. Poverty can also be a huge factor in this.  Everybody has their breaking point and I hope they never reach it, but the sad fact is that it happens on a daily basis. Not everyone is equipped to handle it and these are the things that can tear families apart just as much as they can rally them together to try to help. Not everyone has happy relationships to start/develop whether in regards to the parent-child relationship or that between the parents themselves.

For what it's worth I am genuinely happy for you and I hope you continue on your path of recovery and reach the goals you want from life with the continued support from your family."
