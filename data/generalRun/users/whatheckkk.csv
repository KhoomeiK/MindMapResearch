relationships,fd75clm,t1_fd5gmec,1578199633.0,"Oh yeah. Exactly. When someone opens the door for disgrace in their relationship, it happens something like that. He started to compare his wife to his coworker. First, he doesn't know this girl for real, he was disrespectful in all ways possible. Besides he is so convinced that girl is better than his wife, my god. He's gonna regret so bad. Motherfucking shit. I'm so angry with this guy. If I was op, I would be devastated and probably would have punched his face. I hope op be happy! You got this, girl. Believe it."

Imagine the person you spent so many years, the father of your kids saying ""she always was the one"" and being supper dupper happy while she is dealing with such pain, while she is vulnerable. Omg, would break my heart. I mean, this is too much. Support your mom, because she needs you."
