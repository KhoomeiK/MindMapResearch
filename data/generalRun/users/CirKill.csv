college,fdks5tt,t1_fdkrofh,1578510031.0,"I think the difficulty of AP classes comes less from the classes themselves and more from the general high school environment. Like, most college courses only meet 1 or 2 times a week, but AP classes meet 5 days a week and often have daily homework that consists of college-level material. This is especially bad for people that take multiple at once. If people have a good work ethic, though, then they're probably not as bad."

Calculus and Music Theory are some of the hardest AP classes already, so I get that they'd be even harder in college. I was talking more about classes like AP Language & Composition and AP U.S. History; can be pretty difficult in high school, but my writing and History courses in college have been extremely easy."

college,fdf5gb1,t3_el2cit,1578353739.0,"Depends entirely on your college and your professors. Personally, my overall average in high school was around an 87 but I've been getting mostly As and A+s in college because I've been studying topics that are interesting to me and that I'm good at.

I will say, though, if you've been taking AP classes in high school, they're not at all a good indicator for what college classes are like. AP classes are much more rigorous than college classes because of AP exams. In college you'll have to deal with final exams, but those will most likely be made by your professors instead of the College Board."
