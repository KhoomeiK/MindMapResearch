At least assuming you are using a VPN to say hide your online activity.

Here's the best analogy I have of a VPN... Say you don't want anyone knowing how much chocolate you buy. So you hire Veeps delivery service. When you ask them, veeps sends a truck out to the chocolate store to pick up a box of chocolates... puts it in a large grey box, then delivers it to the Veeps warehouse. Then veeps has another truck pick it up from their warehouse, and the non-descript box to your house. All the chocolate store knows is someone used veeps to pick up the chocolate. All anyone watching knows is veeps delivered the chocolate to the Veeps warehouse...  and they know veeps delivered something to you. Because you are one of hundreds of Veeps customers, no one knows what veeps delievered to who. Supposedly veeps destroys their mainifest at the end of the day, so that afterwards no one knows what was delivered where.



You can think you are getting more security, by hiring yourself a private driver to do it, that way... The problem of course, You would be the sole owner of the warehouse... the chocolate store knows the delivery driver doesn't work for a big company, they can treat and track the private driver just like they can you. If the delivery driver gets caught in a chocolate sting... the police would trace him back to his warehouse... that is on YOUR property."

This analogy works further to explain the handicap system the game has built in. Long and short of it. If people know their skill difference before the game starts, the less skilled player starts the game with stones already on the board, giving him the equivalent of a head start.


Now depending on the context of the relationship etc... there's lots of things that could be seen as dick moves. Going to the racing analogies, if you realize you are a whole league ahead of your opponent in a race, the polite thing to do would be pace yourself a bit above him, cheer him on... maybe give him a few chances to catch up etc...


The dick moves to do would be to say... sprint half the course ahead of him, sit down, read a book, once he starts catching up sprint again etc... Or say blitz ahead and finish the race leaving him near the starting line.


That's before trying to explain attacking etc... which while often a fair technique, also could demotivate a beginner player. Generally early game you set up territory, basically you don't get a solid hold on the area, but you set it up so that you have a solid advantage on taking the area mid game. It's worth more to have an advantage over half the board, than to have an inpenetrable hold on 1/4th of the board. I'd suppose a secondary dick move would be rather than taking area yourself, you could constantly invade your opponents territory, making it so that they never even get a foothold in the game (a strategy that would only be plausible if your opponent never was able to come up with the ideal ways to defend and expand together).
