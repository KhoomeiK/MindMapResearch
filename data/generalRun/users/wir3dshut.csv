It works twice and after that you actually have to call customer service."
TrueCrime,femiwni,t1_femicgd,1579257900.0,Exactly. Whenever I think about that day I just can't believe that I would have even considered getting in. You girls did a good move. Great thinking. So many creeps out there it boggles my mind. Whenever I have kids this will always be on my mind.

TrueCrime,fem6p5b,t3_epsq0e,1579241686.0,"Seen this on Dailymail and made my heart sank. Thank God they found her. These stories are always the worst for me. When I was about 10-11 years old I almost made a big mistake of getting into a stranger's car myself. I was stupid and argued with my parents over something and thought that I would punish them by running away from home. At around 9pm I ran out of the house and started walking in one direction as far from home as possible. When I got by a park called Chopin Park (if anyone is from Chicago) a black Toyota Corolla stopped next to me by a stop sign and a guy started asking me if I needed a ride. He even said that it's dangerous out here and that he can take me anywhere I wanted so jump in!. As I was walking to his car a teenager from the park that was sitting on a bench smoking something yelled to the guy to ""fuck off pervert!"" Or at least that's what I remember it. The guy sped off pretty fast. Anyways, I didn't thank that teen I just ran off myself and after a couple of hours of walking I went back home and nobody even noticed I was gone. I would def thank him today if I met him. I hope he knows he did a very good thing. I don't know why I'm sharing this but yeah."

My passenger (some movie producer) told me that she has a center near Santa Monica for addicts and that it saved him back in the day so my hat off to you good hearted lady.
