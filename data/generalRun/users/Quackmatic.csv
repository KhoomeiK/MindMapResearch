iamatotalpieceofshit,ffd49z5,t1_ffd2m5r,1579813132.0,Guarantee you're the kid at school who took being a prefect or hall monitor way too seriously and grassed on everyone else to butter up the teachers.
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffd3b9k,t1_ffcnsqi,1579812590.0,Uh except this girl literally bullied someone intending to make him kill himself whereas as Salem witches were accused of fuck all due to mass hysteria.
ukpolitics,ff8wte5,t1_ff8ucbm,1579698678.0,"I mean, if you teach kids about what each religion thinks is right, and then they realise that they all say different things for different reasons, it's kind of a logical conclusion that probably none of them are right."

realAMD,fexd9qm,t3_eqksve,1579429055.0,Isn't the 5700 now a bit pointless? Besides the memory bus is there even a difference now? I suspect Nvidia wasn't entirely unaware of this and while I'm not complaining from a customer viewpoint it seems like Nvidia may have just forced AMD to cannibalise sales of the 5700.

explainlikeimfive,fdwjrzl,t1_fdwjgqf,1578759485.0,"That too, I hadn't thought of that. People can die from a fall at 1g. You could probably die ""falling"" when sat down at 2.4g!"
explainlikeimfive,fdwii4b,t1_fdwgo9n,1578759000.0,2.4x Earth gravity would probably cause a lot of health problems while you're there too. It'd mess hugely with your circulatory and lymphatic system. We can survive it fine short term but it'd probably not be livable unless you're already very fit.
