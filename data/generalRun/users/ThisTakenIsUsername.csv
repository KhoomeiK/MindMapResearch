You also are pretty much required to talk in a Discord chat or you get kicked, there's usually at least one person who lags on 2-3 speed, and a host that ragequits if they lose.

Don't even get me started on ""historical"" games. More than an hour wait (2-4 hours sometimes) in a lobby for that one UK puppet, and toxicity beyond belief. 

People will literally ragequit over the dumbest historical details too. I once waited like 4 hours for a game only for everyone to ragequit because Germany (the host) sent tanks to Spain (who historically won the civil war anyway).

And that's just a little bit of what goes on in those games. I'm enraged just thinking about those jerks."
