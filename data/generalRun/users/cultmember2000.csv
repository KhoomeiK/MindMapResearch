Sometimes I have a hard time believing myself too.  My therapist said that sometimes our brains shut down and get confused because we’re trying to protect ourselves from the truth, that we were kids and the people who were supposed to protect us were actively hurting us.  That realization is too much to handle sometimes, so we convince ourselves that we’re making it up or maybe our abusers were right, we’re making a mountain out of a mole hill.

I believe you.  I believe your brothers.  You deserved to feel safe.  You deserved to be loved and supported."

JUSTNOFAMILY,fg82gy7,t1_fg7ye2d,1580607753.0,"The one person I would not be mad at is you.  You were 40 weeks pregnant!  And someone hit you!!  I would be scared and freaked out and unsure of what to do.  These people were supposed to be catering to you, feeding you and making sure you were comfortable and happy.
Instead, they made you feel unwanted and unsafe in your own home.  It is entirely natural to be stunned by their terrible actions."

Thank you for sharing your story, and please let us know how you’re doing."

JUSTNOFAMILY,fg2otg4,t1_fg2h28j,1580450233.0,"He’s under reacting, probably in shock.  He needs to go to therapy, and you need a OOP yesterday.  Tell him, if all of this effort makes your kids a little bit safer, it would be worth it.   And their well-being includes having two parents who are alive and safe."

MomForAMinute,fffs75a,t3_et9ie9,1579890648.0,"Hey love, I had the exact same thing happen.  Same tumor, mine was even a little bigger.   The whole thing is so scary, and it’s completely normal to be nervous.  I’m glad you’re talking about your feelings- I didn’t, and just bottled them up.  I’m sorry your dad isn’t helping out- he’s probably a little nervous himself, and doesn’t want to admit it.
My surgery took me a couple weeks to heal from, so make sure you have movies and books to keep you entertained.
One other thing- my surgery had to be a little more extensive, but later it cause adenomyosis.  So if you have period trouble down the line, it could be that.  Just continue to advocate for your health, you’ve got this!
Sending all the love and hugs."
ChildofHoarder,fffmspm,t1_fffhqby,1579887333.0,"This is such a good comment!  I would just like to add that you’re still a kid, OP.  Take care of yourself in college.  It’s sometimes a little scary or overwhelming at first- there are usually free counseling services offered.  It’s great you want to help out with your siblings, but make sure that it doesn’t come at the cost of your focus on your own future."

AskReddit,ffavhw6,t1_ffam7am,1579745448.0,"Honestly, that sounds like a good idea to transfer.  I went to art school a decade ago, and I’m still making work and I love it so much but it’s sooo hard and most of my classmates stopped doing anything creative a long time ago.
Art school is the best time because you don’t have to juggle a day job and there’s a community and art 24/7, so if it’s not the right fit for you now, it’s only going to get worse."

MomForAMinute,feevux3,t1_feeu5ob,1579042324.0,"I am so glad I asked, because Tortolleni is the best name for a tortoise ever.  I love giant tortoises.  A family friend took care of some (scientist) and when I used to visit when I was very small, he would let me ride on the tortoises backs.  I thought this was a normal childhood activity until a few years ago.
Also, it definitely looks like the pyramiding has evened out!  What a healthy baby girl!!"
