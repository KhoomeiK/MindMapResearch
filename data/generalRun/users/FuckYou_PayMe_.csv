tifu,ff9ez1p,t1_ff9d1tx,1579711578.0,That insanely cheap price of $40 for an hour massage didn't tip you off that the place wasn't legitimate?

tifu,ff8jnm5,t1_ff8edg2,1579681610.0,Maybe he should go to a legit massage place then?
tifu,ff8jksf,t3_es3vsf,1579681497.0,"Do you really think a place like that knows legit reflexology? 

You've both been fucking up for years going to a place that's obviously a front for those ""extra services""

AskReddit,fdu6taz,t1_fdqgf2u,1578728592.0,The original was paintings of old style portraits with scowls whose eyes kept following the person around the room. He pulled the blanket up over his head and fell asleep. He awoke to bright sunlight shining through the windows where the pictures were supposed to be.

Whether that's exercise, healthy eating, keeping the house clean, getting work done. Gotta find a way to balance all those plates and some weeks are better than others. It's ok to rest, just don't stop completely.

Just gotta keep trying :)"
blackladies,fdiwiqk,t3_ell457,1578452635.0,"Yuuuup. I find that behavior comes from many different groups of women. Insecurity knows no bounds. If it makes you feel better, they'll probably age like milk, so carry on being your bad self."

Same concept, if you're a dude who's not a complete piece of shit, then assume it's not about you. Unfortunately, many many many many women can relate."
