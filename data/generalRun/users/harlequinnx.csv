todayilearned,ffegacx,t1_ffdsvy0,1579846865.0,"There are very few actions human beings can take that don't lead to suffering. If you don't have heat in your house due to poverty and you buy a cheap electric blanket made in China, the blanket is created on the back of human rights abuses, environmental problems, and possibly slave labor. 

 Almost every single action we take is a calculus- weighing the benefit to ourselves vs the suffering it causes. Some people choose not to think about it. Some people pick certain actions they deem as uniquely evil or virtutous and focus on those so they can avoid thinking about it. Some people just try to be as kind as possible in order to build up karmic carbon credits. And some people only focus on actions they can directly see.

My sister has chickens. When one starts bullying the rest of the flock, we kill it and eat it. This does not seem inherently bad at all. It is done with minimal suffering and prevents suffering from the rest of the chickens. I do not believe that death in and of itself is bad at all- after all, it happens to everyone and everything. What is important is the mitigation of pain."

I live in a similar area- low wages, low expenses. We are the second poorest county in the state. People say, at least housing is cheap.... But is it really? You have to crunch the numbers.

I love my town. But there are no futures here for anyone young. Get out.

Edit: OP, I have read your post history a bit. You need to get out of West Virginia. I'm serious. The benefits of cheap housing are not worth what it's doing to you.

On the grad school note- i know several people who have gone to grad school for free. With the combo of TA positions and the right program, you can have tuition covered. I was actually told by one professor not to consider any program in my discipline where I had to pay. There are also scholarships and grants sometimes.
