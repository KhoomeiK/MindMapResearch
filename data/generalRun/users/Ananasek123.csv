DotA2,ffxve0b,t1_ffxu2q6,1580333170.0,Reference to my other post when I said about seeing medical help with battling addiction. TL;DR - you can just quit smoking immediately by switching to other ways of getting nicotine in your body and go see a shrink to help you get out of the addiction. It will be hard as shit if you do it wrong.
DotA2,ffxv4ph,t1_ffxqqwy,1580333026.0,"Smoking cigarettes is the most stupid and harmful way to get nicotine in your system. You can **literally** stop smoking without any effort tomorrow. Switch to non-smoking nicotine sources (like patches or pills, or even e-cigs if you really can't live without sucking on something and inhaling stuff) and go see a psychiatrist to help you to battle the psychological addiction. Actual physical detox from nicotine is very mild and can be done almost without any side effects - just dose less and less nicotine and you'll be free of physical addiction in few weeks or months, depending on how much did you smoke.

I know at least five people who quit smoking that way and they never look back - easy and painless. I also know few people who tried quitting smoking ""oldschool"" (like this bullshit THIS IS MY LAST CIG EVER!), and it was very hard for them and they came back multiple times.

People who say that giving up on smoking is very hard are probably those people who never actually used modern medicine to battle the addiction. If you break your arm you don't just wrap it up in bandage and let it heal on it's own. You see a doctor who specializes in fixing your arm. I completely don't understand why people don't do that with smoking."

Dogfree,ffwcthg,t3_evkb2b,1580295748.0,"There should be no such thing as ""animal shelters"". Animal control should just do whatever is necessary to keep residents safe. I'm not sure how it should work, because I'm not an expert on wildlife, but something like:

1) kill aggressive ones/pests on the spot (or transport somewhere to be killed, whatever is more convenient) and dispose of dead

2) grab lost and confused wildlife and release them to the wild

3) grab lost and confused pets, check for owner info on them and return them for a fee. If there is no info, it's a pest. Go to number 1).
