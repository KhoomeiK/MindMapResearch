He won’t usually drink prune juice from a bottle, since he’s too busy trying to taste the sweet juice and doesn’t actually suck the bottle. So I came up with the genius idea of mixing his morning oatmeal with prune juice instead of water. He loved it, ate it all up. I even gave him an extra helping because he was doing so well eating it and because he hasn’t been eating as much as normal because of the constipation. 

And let me tell you, it worked! Oh boy did it work! Worked a little too well in fact. Three of the stinkiest diaper changes I’ve had to date, including two blow-outs later and little dude is feeling much better. Dad, on the other hand, has had a traumatic day."
