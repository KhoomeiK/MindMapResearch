UniversalOrlando,fewm6lo,t3_eqgp6s,1579414345.0,"I understand wanting to get the hell out of Illinois, I was born there and moved to Tampa well over twenty years ago. Things have massively changed down here

I’ve seen my share of people move here because of the parks, beaches, and a laid back life and fail or give up

Like everyone is saying, housing is far from cheap, especially rent. One bed apartments are going for $1500/month around me 

You either like heat and humidity, or you melt. Personally, I’m fine but come September I’m ready for it to end

Orlando is in the midst of a building boom and it’s only going to get bigger. Orlando is like most cities, it has good and bad. Do your best to find a job before you move down

You’ll be working, so unless you work in a park, you won’t be living in them. After awhile, you’ll probably slow down on how often you visit. When my daughter was little we spent every weekend at Disney except for summer. When she got a little older, a lot more time at Universal. By the time she graduated from high school, she was burned out on the parks

In the summer, Orlando feels thirty degrees hotter than Tampa, because we have a sea breeze. Summer and holiday traffic around Orlando SUCKS. As bad as Chicago but with tourists that don’t know where they’re going or don’t care because they’re just visiting 

I’m just sharing my experiences, I love it here. It’s just not for everyone. People are a hell of a lot nicer. You wouldn’t be far from Cocoa Beach if you’re into that. There’s definitely no shortage of things to do, you’d be close to a couple of cruise ports and there’s great deals during off seasons

I remember thinking, “I’m dead” and then I was pulled through a tunnel and I woke up. I kind of realized I was in a hospital and my wife and daughter were sitting by my bed. That’s when they told me I had been in a coma for three weeks and had just snapped out"
