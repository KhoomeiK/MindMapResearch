gifs,fczmdy7,t3_ejj5fs,1578104387.0,"Annoyingly, due to a few annoying paragraphs in British law, segways and all forms of non-assistive (I.e. pedal-assist e-bikes) are illegal in the U.K. at the moment. No electric scooters or skateboards, as they all end up classed as motor vehicles, meaning full legal requirement to have indicators, brakes lights, headlights, the whole lot. 

Hopefully it gets changed soon, they‚Äôve been talking about it for a while as my wife is disabled and would benefit highly from something simple like a scooter she can fold up into the car."

aww,fc2qb9b,t3_eftjkx,1577370858.0,"Congratulations - when it comes to animals, there is no better feeling than finally gaining their trust. 

We took in a rescue cat called Carly (18 months old female) as company for our other cat (Random, 7yr male).

We were told that no-one at the shelter had ever been able to stroke her or pick her up, and she never makes a sound. With a week I was able to pick her up for a couple of minutes before she got restless. That was 7 years ago now and still she surprises us - she now won‚Äôt shut up, and in the past 12 months she now comes to us and falls asleep on our lap. Before that she sit down for a stroke for 5 minutes then she‚Äôd be off. 

Enjoy every minute of it!"
