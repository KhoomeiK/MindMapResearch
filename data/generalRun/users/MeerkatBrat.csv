politics,ffpg296,t1_ffpeau0,1580094160.0,It’s mind blowing because John Bolton has been apart of the GOP forever and his views very much align with that of Republicans. The fact that so many Fox News viewers would be gullible enough to believe Bolton is a deep state plant apparently decades in the making is absolutely astounding.
politics,feitqh8,t1_feg5iva,1579146975.0,"This is something that is so wrong with politics these days. Presidential candidates shouldn’t have “meme teams” to discredit their opponents. Not to mention when the previously mentioned opponent belongs to the same party the candidate ultimately desires to win... Putting that aside, candidates should debate policy with reason and facts, not fucking memes. Jfc"
politics,feiesez,t3_eoufvk,1579136836.0,"It really bothers me that evidence like this coming out closer to the beginning of trumps presidency probably would’ve resulted in much more outrage, and possibly removal from office.  Instead, we’re three years deep into this nightmare of corruption and distortion of truth, and we’ve become numb to the bullshit Trump does and supports. This instance of criminality is just tossed onto the pile. Does this *honestly surprise* anyone? It is unsettling and somewhat shocking, but not surprising coming from Trump and his men."
catbellies,feflps9,t3_eotcua,1579059013.0,"What a beautiful girl. I’m very sorry for your loss. She looks like such a sweetheart. You will be able to see her again one day once you cross that rainbow bridge yourself. Until then, she will be thinking of and waiting for you to join her one day.

wholesomememes,fefl64f,t1_fefgtq8,1579058667.0,I think op meant that the hand with the engagement ring looked like it was the man’s hand due to the perspective. Not that the woman herself had man hands.
politics,fefkfu6,t1_fdh8aru,1579058215.0,"I know I’m a week late replying, but I’m catching up on politics. The House holds the sole power of impeachment [(article 1, section 2)](https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/Article_1_Section_2.pdf). The Senate has the sole power to uphold or acquit that ruling [(article 1, section 3)](https://www.annenbergclassroom.org/article-i-section-3/). I suppose it depends on how you look at the situation, but *yes,* Trump has been impeached by the House, however he has not been removed from office yet (Only the senate can make that decision). No impeachments to date have ever been upheld by the Senate, but Trump has become one of just three presidents to have *ever* been impeached by the House. He joins Johnson (1868) and Clinton (1998)."
politics,fefh7ub,t1_fef6v65,1579056260.0,"I understand that she is a likable candidate among Democrats and around the country, but I just don’t see that approval and likeability correlating with this year’s primary. It’s purely anecdotal, but I’ve yet to witness anyone say they are voting for her in the primary. I support Klobuchar, I just think she can do much more for Americans in the senate than running for the nomination, especially considering how popular she is in her home state."
wholesomememes,fefc0oc,t1_feev12g,1579053017.0,Now that you’ve said it I can’t unsee it.
wholesomememes,fefbywa,t1_fef6wor,1579052983.0,That’s a shitty thing to say. I think they both look equally beautiful.
CatsAreAssholes,fef2pkh,t1_fedsvsv,1579046776.0,"Chiming in with other suggestions, black cats really are wonderful! I’ve had three in my whole life and they have always been the sweetest ones. We have an 8 year old black cat now named Mika that we rescued, and oh man you can not find a friendlier cat. He does love table scraps though and will occasionally slap food out of your hand, especially biscuits."
politics,feezwf7,t1_feev5rh,1579044915.0,"It really surprises me that Klobuchar can manage to get on the debate stage but someone like Yang can’t. Maybe I just haven’t seen enough of what’s out there, but I haven’t come across *any* Klobuchar supporters, but have seen plenty of Yang supporters."
politics,fdht2v0,t1_fdhqgeq,1578429649.0,"Democrats did allow witnesses. They wanted Bolton, Mulvaney, and McGahn, but Trump ordered them not to testify. If they had tried to fight to enforce those subpoenas they could’ve been tied up in court for years. That was not the objective."
OldSchoolCool,fdfl2za,t1_fdezgxt,1578364199.0,For some reason I’m drawing a blank on the orange fad. Do you have any examples?
Zoomies,fdfkkg0,t1_fdff3zs,1578363862.0,"Believe it or not, sharing the joy and love your pet brought to your life with other people can help you grieve and make you feel better, asshole."
trashy,fcsejxc,t1_fcqpi2y,1577915419.0,"Everybody is tough behind a keyboard, but in reality something like this is so shocking and surprising that most people would probably react in a similar way to the Asian girl. Maybe you wouldn’t just laugh it off, but you wouldn’t start a fight. I think there are very few people who would just instantly start punching and throwing hands after this, especially being in such a large crowd, probably drunk, and in front of cameras. Not to mention that in crowds like that you’re almost constantly being shoved by somebody anyways."
