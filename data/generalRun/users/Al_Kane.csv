Think of thousands of kids like this, some with the force and some without, all instilled with the message of hope. The movie itself is about continuing - Luke has given up at the start, ready to die as the last Jedi, but his arc is one of realisation that even though the Jedi Order is gone, the ideas of hope, justice and freedom will continue. The kid at the end symbolises the next generation taking up the mantle.

Of course, ROS still drives a freight train through this: turns out Luke's sacrifice was for naught since 'nobody responded' when they broadcasted the rally call at the end of TLJ. Also, since ROS confirmed Leia as a Jedi, it makes the notion of Luke as 'the last jedi' look pretty stupid."

I'm trying to talk to people as much as possible so that I don't feel so isolated, and to raise my spirits up, also we're going to visit Mum every other day. My best wishes for you and your family. I hope you pull through."
