If these people kill all the elephants, it completely imbalances the ecosystem. The animals who eat elephants goes hungry, then they die, the the animals who are also prey to those animals overpopulates, and becomes like an invasive species.

Power: kill-aid

The OH YEAH can splash some of his kool-aid onto a survivor. If it hits the survivor, it causes the survivor to acquire the “Drowning state”. It’s basically just like the deep wounded state, but it’s quicker and it shows the kool-aid man where the survivor is. If they do not heal within the time limit, they are insta-downed and the OH YEAH is shown their location. Also, instead of putting them on hooks, he can also put them inside of his pitcher, which would be the same as being on a hook. The survivors can be rescued by either stunning the killer or summoning the survivor at a kool-aid fountain, which are scattered across the map. The OH YEAH can also smash through windows, walls, and pallets by using the m2 button. This takes 5 seconds to charge up."
