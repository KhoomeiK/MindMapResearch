When I was like early 20s, I had to read books or pay a trainer to access information about lifting... Jeff Cavaliere (sp?), Nippard, and Ryan Humiston, and countless others are founts of info! 

Good luck, homie! 

I was where you are... I actually wish someone had told me to lift instead of just (mine was surfing) cardio. I got skinny, and in some ways stronger, but weights would've been good! I was much older when I discovered the magic of IRON!"
sports,ffjogut,t1_ffji7om,1580002994.0,"You asked, so your grammar and writing mechanics could use some work. 

I'd agree that footwork is a great skill to develop! But, when it comes to a more intrinsic talent... maybe attribute is more apt... vision is hard to develop in an athlete. Thus something that sets *some* athletes apart from the majority/their competition! 

Plus, what is the percentage of fights that go to the ground? So, would that be kneework, or glutes/hips, or would you call that footwork?

Of course, at that point, it becomes less about vision too... unless seeing where one is (in relation to sides/walls and environmental) matters. Maybe when one's opponent is doing something? Maybe in looking for vulnerabilities...

But, I gotta ask... why so pissy? I feel like I'm talking to a teenager!

GettingShredded,ffjndpm,t1_ffj43nc,1580002261.0,"Maybe not throw weight around, assuming you mean go heavy? 

But ya... start getting your joints and muscles accustomed to resistance training! Go light, find good form, develop the habit of lifting, then once you've hit goal weight, and have the foundation started, you'll make sweet gains! 

That's the thing... the results aren't immediate with the body. Going from binge eating to something clean takes a few weeks before ya get into cruise control... for some, months! With lifting, it takes longer... and, an injury could be super derailing. But without difficulty be it heavy or hypertrophy or just working against the grain by inflicting pain, or the pride in being weak around smaller stronger people, gains can suck. 

I say start lifting, Just don't go crazy."

This is no wasted movement. And, being relaxed allows short or small movements that are fast without changing loaded strikes. 

Your summary is apt. I'd only add that each point is part of a larger attribute: vision.

EDIT:  I speak of the kind of vision that is associated with high speed action based sports. Like a quarterback making a presnap read, or a linebacker keying on a specific player, while *also* reading the offensive line, knowing where the back is going *before* the back gets there... you know, ""keep ya head on a swivel!"" If you need that eli5'd let me know! 

I mean the kind of vision that isn't simply eyesight... could you imagine fighters wearing corrective lenses?! Does make me wonder though. I also do not mean the kind of vision that MLK had for Civil Rights!  Or, even the vision shamans have regarding a higher existence! 

I mean the vision to read, evaluate, interpret, land perfectly placed strikes, delivered by perfect footwork-based physiology. The vision of an experienced tactician measuring a million little observations and discriminating what matters and what to do next, aka instincts! The kind of vision that evolves during a baseball game to work small ball or throw your high era reliever, etc. Thr kind of vision that picks up and interprets an opponent's doubt, thus STRIKE fast. Or, see your opponents over aggressive moves thus a strategic retreat! 

Conor is playing chess, holding a bazooka! And when he sees the time to rook to knights bishop, or KABOOM, it's his ability to see the whole fight. Time slows down better for him, for him to SEE it all, than other fighters.

You built a great rationale for your disagreement that many groups yadda yadda. I simply said more people, more problems!  

I suppose it's a natural leap that more people would inherantly lead to more groups, but that really results in collective action, and my thinking on that topic is very specific (Mancur Olsen: The Logic of Collective Action, 1965) is that tyranny occurs even in ""groups,"" thus a majority of individuals become subjugated by a ruling few... and to tie in your point about many groups, this would suggest that there are many majorities subjugated by many ruling few!  Thus, my generalization: more people, more problems. And that's simply in regards to representation and collective action! Your point about a world infrastructure (I like that description, haven't heard it before) being based to suit a much smaller population is another level of MORE PEOPLE, MORE PROBLEMS! So, I disagree that you disagree... LOL.

As for the stuff about tribalism and extremism... I mean take 3 people, nice small scale, it invariably has 2 v. 1 conflicts.

So, in this sense, Trump is libertarian... he has no side, flows where the wind blows, pursues self interest while lying to the masses. And Weld was on the other end of the libertarian spectrum: was the libertarian candidate, but respected individual beliefs enough to not want to trample them. And, was mindful enough to know that his party wasn't about *him* so much as it was what was best for the greatest number of people at that moment... and given he really didn't have a chance of winning, considered which side was probably the best option!

I have no doubts that Biden has some dirt on his hands for SOMETHING... but, what is the ""justification"" for a sitting president to wrap himself up with all these oligarchs and lawyers, just to ""expose"" said scandal? 

The problem with politics is that none of our candidates are squeaky clean, NONE! But, when their hands get caught in whatever inappropriate cookie jar, they point at others and say,  ""but, what about THEM?!"" 

Right now, the left has Trump, and likely all sorts of other Repubes by the balls, and rightfully so... money and political influence are clear no nos! 

But, 'the president's side,' the ""but, what about them"" that I'm waiting to hear, is what was this awful thing that Biden did/is doing that the president felt justified in asking for investigation? 

I mean, if Biden was human trafficking or something, then Trump is a hero, right? 

But, ya, NOTHING.  

So, I don't know if you're a bot, or just a hard core conservative, but it's possible that the best thing for your party is a serious reality check. If the left is so bad, then be the good! Otherwise, if you're fighting evil with evil, what difference is there between the two sides? 

And, as a centrist, I pose the same point to the left. 

What Hillary did to Sanders, y'all sick bastards are the reason we're stuck with Trump. And, the ""answer"" is Elizabeth Warren alleging Bernie is her friend, but doesn't think a woman will ever be prez?! THAT'S the kind of anti-Trump tactics your party is about?  C'mon! I'm embarrassed by own country. 

And, Biden was involved with SOMETHING, otherwise the right wing snakes wouldn't be clinging so hard to their rhetoric... honestly, I think it's horseshit, but it'll be SOMETHING, then a string of lies.  Not important foreign investigations worthy, but something not entirely altruistic.

You're part of the solution, how? 

Look, I could give a shit about rural voters. Same amount as I'd give for urban, or black, or white, or female... I assume individuals are rational. Obviously they're/we're not! But, with my assumption in place, the EC seems to be an effort to maintain federalism, a tenet of our governmental structure. I can see how the math works out such that a general election can be one way, whereas the EC is the other. 

But, what I asked is for the rationale behind the EC... I already have a pretty good idea, I think, but I'm unable to consider a *better* way without having to concede either the EC or what is underlying purpose is. So, when I encounter those who are PRO EC, I ask the question ""why not the EC?"" I hear their rhetoric and it's always the same drivel... which tells me they don't really understand it. When I encounter you opposite lot, I ask for some evidence of understanding FOR the EC... honestly because I might be missing something and want to know more. But all I ever recieve is eloquent bullshit LITERALLY copy/pasted from some other discussion/debate/argument. And it's ALWAYS involving the strawman *BuT tHe RuRaL vOtErS* which is easy to eviscerate. Now, rural voters CAN benefit from the EC, but so can also *other* marginal voters... at least from MY understanding. 

Which, my understanding can be improved... but not from BS like your 3/5th vote strawman from yestercentury. But, it does sound good in a Civics classroom, or surrounded by fellow undergrads, I'll grant you that! 

I don't know why I bother seeking enlightenment online... all I encounter is entrenched bias that literally copy/pastes their *whoppers* of points in the age old battle of whatever divisive topic.  Time was I'd encounter more moderate opinions, with illumination of both sides of an argument on this thread... with the occasional peppering of prepper hysteria... but, now this sub is straight argument. 

My point is that each side thinks there are only a few points that the other side has to base their whole viewpoint... thus come loaded to squash those arguments, but unfortunately only end up making the same tired points that the other side think make up the whole viewpoint. So it's just yelling across the divide the same BS over and over and over... putting on some witty insults to claim victory, but contributing NOTHING!
