He also used to do these videos where people could send in their arrangements and he would critique them. Deffs recommend giving those a watch.

TrueOffMyChest,ff812sb,t3_erzhg1,1579663221.0,"Okay, super nerdy linguistics-grad babble incoming:

There's actually a reason why we instinctively cringe at new pronouns being added. It's because function markers (like pronouns) exist in a closed class system. Closed class words are for grammatical indication, and they rarely change. A language can replace a noun four times before it replaces a grammatical marker.

Words in open class systems, like nouns and verbs, are very flexible and regularly change. We can easily add words like ""yeet"" or ""twerk"" or change the meaning of ""stream"" to indicate an online usage without anyone really blinking. Sure, purists might complain about ""young people ruining the sanctity of this language"" for a little bit, but it won't take long before the open class word is considered grammatical.

This is precisely why ""they"" was such a great alternative. English has a hole in its grammar in that we do not have a written way to express singular gender-neutral or gender-unknown in a sentence, which is an issue. But because pronouns are closed class, we can't just add a new word unless something ""catastrophic"" happened to the language (like government being overtaken by a different country with a new language or a massive vowel shift).

So speakers of English took the word ""they"" that already existed in this system, and modified it to fill this gap. It's literally perfect, and is everything that a language would do in this situation.

Yeah. Language is both pretty predictable and also very cool."

Their heart was in the right place with this rescue but unfortunately it was just too late) and wow for YEARS after that, just being in the same room as a dog would drive me to tears.

I remember once my dad took me to a family friend's house who had the sweetest golden retriever ever. An absolute unit. Young me? I stayed in the car the *entire* afternoon because I couldn't go near the dog. My dad thought maybe I would cave, especially if there was food, but I refused. I was so petrified of dogs that I couldn't do it.

What finally got me to be okay around dogs was my best friend had a little pug that just slept all day. Being around that allowed me to be comfortable with small dogs. Then, shortly after, she got a puppy burnese mountain dog. I met it when it was small, but overtime I watched it grow to a 150lb giant teddy bear. This dog couldn't hurt a fly, but it was massive. One time I was sitting on the floor and this dog came over to me and tried to curl up on my lap. It was so adorable, I couldn't help but totally fall for it.

Now I *love* dogs. I'm so glad that I worked through my fear of them, because if I had given up when it got scary, I wouldn't have been able to adopt my own dog. He's my best friend.

For a lot of Boston schools, they have a long history of racism in who they accepted. Schools like Harvard, MIT, BU, BC, etc have a very low percentage of black students who attend, especially since many students who attend these schools get in through pre-college prep courses and tutors, and many students are legacy families. So this ceremony is both a way of keeping administration accountable as it is a way for students to have a moment.

As someone who attended one of these schools, that specific graduation ceremony is such a tiny portion of the whole graduation weekend, and honestly nobody really cares. It’s cool for the black students, since many of them come from disadvantaged families (example: friend who came from a deep southern, highly racist community, incarcerated father, got into school entirely on scholarship, graduated with 3.8) so it’s a nice “congrats” to those students.

It's easy to blame your metabolism, but that's usually not the case unless you're in menopause. Since you had an eating disorder, you probably can't count calories? So try looking at the foods that you're eating and instead of thinking of taking away foods, think about what foods can be replaced with healthier alternatives.

The thing is, I was absolute shit at cardio before. Couldn't do more than 15min on the elliptical without feeling like I wanted to die. But then—low and behold—I went to voice therapy, learned how to breathe using the correct muscles, and now I can go to the gym and stay on the elliptical for 30min without feeling tired at all. Hell, I can stay on there for an hour if I really push myself.

I'm not saying this is your issue, but try to breathe from your stomach without moving your chest/shoulders at all (put one hand right below your boobs, and one hand on your chest. The hand below your boobs should move, the hand on your chest shouldn't). Is this difficult? If so, this could be a factor in why you're gassing out so quickly. You're just not using all the muscles you could be when you breathe, and therefore not getting enough oxygen in your body! There are loads of awesome tutorials on diaphragmatic breathing on youtube, and you can always DM me if you need!"

I've never regretted going, even if I didn't get a ""true"" workout in, but I've always regretted skipping."

relationship_advice,fee08na,t1_fedov2d,1579023641.0,"Exactly! It honestly horrified me a little bit when I read all the comments pushing for her to report him. I find that people who offer that kind of advice are people who have never been assaulted by anyone, much less someone who’s in a position of power over you. It’s a huge safety risk and she will likely have to move if she does.

I used to be one of those people too, and I told myself that if I were ever assaulted, I would take his ass to court no matter what. Except life has a funny way of turning your perspective around, and once I was in that kind of position I realized just how sticky these situations were. I liked my current life and friendships too much to want to give it all up, so I decided to play the long game. It was really hard, but it was the right thing to do for my own sanity.

If OP feels she’s in a position where she can report him, possibly get him transferred to a different department, then by all means go ahead. But if she feels that reporting him would only put her safety at risk, then quite frankly it’s not worth it. Your mental health post-assault is so utterly fucked, and so getting that back on track is priority number one. Do whatever will get you there."

trueloseit,fe6rkry,t3_eo0pe9,1578902061.0,"Heya! Reaching out for help is really hard, so good on you for doing this! It shows that you are ready to do this!

Apologies for unorganized text below, as it is late and my brain is tired.

I like to advise starting slow. Look at what you have in your cabinets. What can you eliminate from your diet first? The easiest one to start with is liquid calories like soda and juice. If you don't drink a lot of water, and instead drink a lot of sugary drinks, work on this one first. Cutting out sugary drinks alone will immediately show a huge difference, and overtime your taste buds will adapt to water.

Then look at what kind of eater you are. Do you snack a lot? If so, work on getting a meal schedule down. Do you eat a lot of fast food? Learn to meal prep, and learn how to make quick but healthy meals. Are you a binge eater? Find online or in person support groups for help with that, and maybe seek therapy

Figuring out what kind of eater you are will help facilitate your approach for losing weight. Remember: everyone is different. The best diet is the one that works for you.

There are lots of different ""diets"" to choose from, including Intermittent Fasting (only eat during allotted hours of the day), CICO (count calories using calorie counter app), Keto (no carbs, low sugar), tracking macros (tracking sugar, protein, and carb intake) etc. Ultimately, whatever approach you choose, you must consume less calories than you burn off in order to be successful. If you don't know how many calories your body naturally burns off, I recommend using [an online TDEE calculator](https://tdeecalculator.net/), which takes less than a minute to calculate. It's recommended you eat roughly 500 calories less than your natural TDEE to lose weight safely.

Sticking to a diet in the beginning is HARD, I won't lie. And the cravings are really intense that first week. But after a few weeks, it gets easier. But if a few weeks go by and you're feeling weak and lightheaded, then reevaluate your diet and come up with a new plan. Your diet will be difficult, but you should feel BETTER on it, not worse.

Now exercise. The good thing is, you don't necessarily NEED exercise in order to be successful at losing weight. So if this whole thing is super overwhelming to you right now, then just focus on the diet. You can't outrun a bad diet.

But if/when you feel ready to exercise, figure out what kind of exercise is going to work for you and then have at it. Even simple things like just going for a short walk after dinner while listening to an audiobook can make all the difference. There are also really great home workout videos on Youtube you can do for people of all fitness levels. Just search for them! If you want to go to the gym, there are lots of really great videos to help beginner gym-goers as well!

Apologies for the incredibly long response. I am no expert, but I hope you find at least some of this information useful! Good luck! You can do this!"

AmItheAsshole,fe67h41,t3_ensbqt,1578883506.0,"NAH. Deaf people can be suspicious because, as I'm sure you've noticed, a lot of hearing families do actively keep their deaf kids from engaging in Deaf culture. But Deaf culture is similar to French culture in that they can be very judgemental.

On the other side of this, your son is 15. Anything your parents do is automatically uncool, so attending Deaf events with family is uncool. That and middle school sucks for *anyone.* He probably is blaming his social troubles in middle school on Deaf culture alone, and doesn't realize that middle schoolers of any culture are just like that. On top of that all, he's at that phase where all he wants is to fit in with all the other teens. Most teens are hearing, so voila. All together this makes a good cocktail for teen rebellion.

He will gain perspective when he's older, but he won't resent you. Eventually he'll likely find a group of Deaf friends along with his hearing friends. You just have to take a backseat for now and let him figure this out on his own. If anyone tries to give you crap about it, screw them."

I've said this on a post similar, but the first one that comes to mind is ""a nickname."" Originally was ""an ekename."" People heard it ""a nekename"" so that's what they started spelling it as.

trueloseit,fe2yua8,t3_ennvk7,1578844357.0,"I wish you immense luck on your journey! It’s difficult, but you absolutely can do this! You are stronger than your cravings!

I’ve never been obese, so I can’t speak for that, but I have struggled with depression and anxiety and just last year it would take me HOURS to get out of bed, let alone even think about exercising. The thing that really worked for me, honestly, was going on this journey slow.

I first focused on just eating 2-3 meals a day. That was it. Either 2 meals and one snack, or a full three meals. No snacking in between that. I know it’s different for everyone, but I was really struggling to motivate myself to get out of bed and make myself a meal. So this was phase one. 

After a few months, this got easier, and my body and hunger signals adjusted accordingly. I was eating better just because I was eating full meals, and that alone was giving me more energy and motivation. So at that point, I got a gym membership and went once a week. I knew much more than this would overwhelm me, so I took it slow. Baby steps!

Once that got easier I added another day. This was harder, and some weeks I wouldn’t go twice a week, so I had to learn to not beat myself up and give up on the weeks I didn’t make it. It’s okay, just get back on track the next week!

After a few months of this, I finally looked up my TDEE, started calorie counting, increased my gym time, and started weightlifting too. This was by far the hardest change, and I couldn’t have done it had I not done the prep work beforehand. Because now I had the energy to say no to take out, and I had the energy to cook for myself. Keep in mind, I’m not a good cook! But I can make simple, healthy meals and that was important! 

Eventually, this got easier too. I’m now at the point where I can eat in a caloric deficit and it’s no problem! Now I sometimes even save some calories for a small treat at the end of the day. (My mom loves baking lol).

Everyone’s journey is different. For me I needed to start slow, while other people can do everything at once and be fine. I think if you’ve tried and failed so much in the past, look back at your failures and ask yourself what they all had in common. Were you restricting too much at once? Was your caloric intake too low? Were you not eating enough protein? See what the common denominator of those are before you start on this journey. Because you want this one to be your last, so make sure you have a plan for success! 

You can do this!"

With my disability, my goal was to be just like everyone else. I never was able to excel in school and I wanted that more than *anything.* I ended up getting into a really good college and just fell so hard. I almost flunked out, but managed to pass with a 2.89 GPA which now, trying to go to grad school, I'm very concerned about. I KNOW I will excel in grad school because I'm going into a program that—this time—my grade won't be impacted by my disability. But still. The fact that this stupid thing might ruin everything is really hard.

I kind of cried a little this morning thinking about everything. It hurts because real disabilities can set you back so much, and often times everyone just assumes you're lazy and unmotivated when really you're trying so damn hard. In order to be average you have to work twice as hard and every time you mess up even a little, you are suddenly so far behind.
