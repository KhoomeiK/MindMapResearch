I physically got between them and started profusely complimenting and faux flirting with the old guy. I put my arm around him and gently led him away. Thank God the young guy was sober and had some control.

I've traveled a lot solo and love hostels for the social environment. They are a great source of local activities as well. They are not always perfect, but neither is traveling nor life for that matter! 

I have a friend who has couch surfed all over the world and loves it. I'm a solo woman and so is she.

I'm intrigued by couch surfing but wary of the amount of trust put into a stranger. Yes being a woman really factors in here. I'm no shrinking violet and very streetwise. However it sounds like an excellent way to make a real connection and deeply learn about a culture in a short amount of time.

Once you can get the basic gist of the Portuguese ""accent"" (ex: male ending of ""e"" in Spanish = ""o"" in Portuguese, pronounced more like a swallowed ""oo"")  it's a bit easier. Of course they are not the same and there are many regional accents as well. However many Portuguese can understand Spanish.

I've attempted to learn both simultaneously (what was I thinking? Well was traveling South America). My French helped me immensely with Portuguese. Especially reading. Boa viage!"

It is so warm, I've worn it a zillion times and it looks new. I've snowboarded and camped in it many, many times. I've washed it and put it in the dryer a million times too. However now I air dry it. It did shrink a bit (in the first decade, lol) but it actually fits me better smaller and I think it tightened up the fibers in a beneficial way. 

I remember thinking it cost a fortune when I bought it (I really can't remember how much, unfortunately) but it's astounding how it's help up.

If you think pharmaceutical companies are developing flu shots out of the kindness of their hearts you are naive. Pushing flu shots are about $$$$. 

Have you heard of superbugs which gain strength from mutating off of flu shots that don't wipe out their strains? Are you aware of the low efficacy rates of the flu shot? I realize wishful thinking is a lot more pleasant than reality.
