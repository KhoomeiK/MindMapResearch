AskReddit,fdn4ioj,t3_em93j7,1578577052.0,"It was a rainy Wednesday night. I was at the local CVS with my daughter to pick up my high blood pressure medication while my daughter browsed the candy isle close by.

I’m grabbing my medication and on the way out I hear a loud bap, bap, bap, bap, and screaming from what seemed like a small crowd of people. I heard someone say, “He’s got a gun!”

I knew this was my moment. I’ve trained for this for years. I practiced my skills in my moms basement as an adolescent and kept training into adult hood even though my friends thought I was crazy.

But I always carry. I ALWAYS carry.

I run to the screams. I see one person down towards the front of the CVS. Then, I see a man, about 5’8, with a rifle pointed at a mother and her child.

This was it. I pulled out my plastic collapsible lightsaber and I said , “HEY! STOP! Your slaughter ends here!”.

He takes one look at me, and shoots me in the leg. Then, almost out of mercy, he slowly walks over to me to finish me off.

As he gets right up to me, rifles length away, I stab him right in the chest with my collapsible light saber. He laughs.

Then I say Carol! Do what daddy taught you. From the cover of the candy isle, my daughter steps out with the .45 caliber gun I’d given to her before we went in “just in case something went down at the local CVS”, and BAM! She gets him right in the head and he immediately drops on the floor.

One dead, one wounded, and one hero. Carol. 

But if it wasn’t for my confidence in my collapsible light saber that I’ve trained with for 14 years, he may not have hesitated and Carol may not have been able to get the deadly shot off.

After the ordeal I thought, “Wow, collapsible light sabers are so cool. I’m gonna buy another one”."
