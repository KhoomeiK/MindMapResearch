Soviets and the Nazis made a plan to invade Poland. They agreed to a new border. The Katyn massacre showed the Soviets intensions of removing any obstacles to occupation clearly. Or was that also necessary to somehow fight the Nazis? Was committing mass murder and then blaming the Nazis for it a brilliant nuanced stratagem according to you?

Claiming the victim is at fault for being attacked is also very typical thinking of an aggressor. ""We had no choice. We had to kill them. They were in the way of our interests.""

>The Soviets at that point rightfully assumed that the Polish Government had fled the country and moved in to enforce the limit of the German advance.

How do you reach such a conclusion when they already made the plan to attack beforehand? It was not a reactionary action. It was all in the Secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrov pact.

> They did not actually help to defeat Poland as Polish troops were told  not to engage with the Soviets. In fact, the Soviet Union wasn't even  expelled from the League of Nations for entering Poland when it did (it  was for invading Finland later that same year). 

That is just very wrong. Poland was in serious disarray from the Nazis and outnumbered on both fronts. Most troops were fighting the Nazis and they didnt consider a backstab by the Soviets. After that it became an impossible battle when before it was nearly impossible. The fact that the League of Nations did nothing even though millions were being killed by the Soviets isn't a very compelling argument. They failed to act."

There is no difference between the Nazis and the Soviets. Both had a total lack of respect for human life and killed millions. Soviets didn't ""help stop"" the Nazis.
