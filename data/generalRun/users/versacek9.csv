AmItheAsshole,fffv2gm,t1_ffdayvx,1579892425.0,I was forced to watch a kosher slaughter video. Literally the worst thing I’ve seen.
NoStupidQuestions,fffrvrr,t3_et6mos,1579890453.0,"Your teachers were wrong. You don’t use a comma when there’s a pause in the sentence. In fact, there’s a lot of sentences that have natural voiced pauses, but grammatically do not require a comma. 

Commas are used to separate clauses and are mostly reserved for after certain words such as ‘but,’ as well as usage for denoting lists. Reorganizing the syntax of a sentence will also demand a comma: 

A) I ate it with a fork. 

B) With a fork, I ate it. 

Most of the time you do not need a comma."
DunderMifflin,fffrh55,t1_fff5mcw,1579890202.0,"I went to a celebrity basketball game and only recognized like 3 maybe 4 people, even though they were all big names.  The only real way I recognize them is if they have a posse following them. 

lil Nas X came right up to me and we exchanged hellos and I didn’t realize he was famous until way after the fact. Some do have an air of “I’m a celebrity, I’m more important than you” but others don’t have that vibe or clique and they seem completely normal."

TooAfraidToAsk,ffdtbu8,t3_et259f,1579828411.0,"Me either is incorrect, but it doesn’t really matter because nobody will correct you on it. 

So essentially yes, they mean the same thing. 

Just like regardless and irregardless mean the same thing. Irregardless isn’t technically necessary, but it’s still a word.

depression,ffdt54f,t3_et2c13,1579828275.0,"I feel that so hard. I’ve been diagnosed with chronic/major depression so I’ve had it since I was a kid. I genuinely don’t know what it feels like to enjoy fun activities or relax in social environments. 

I genuinely don’t know if there’s a part of me that actually wants to get better. Like surface I do, but underlyingly.. I’m comfortable."

AmItheAsshole,ffdme51,t3_esw014,1579823969.0,"NTA. Do what’s best for you. Being in a situation you don’t want to be in, especially when you know you have other options, can fuck you up for a long time."
