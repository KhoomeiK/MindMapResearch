WithoutATrace,fc69t8f,t1_fc69jq9,1577475576.0,I had to read the article again and form my response. It takes a long time to do.
WithoutATrace,fc69qtc,t1_fc67v9x,1577475532.0,"Sure. Honestly there are just a lot of randomly placed sentences, and it just isn't formatted like a well written story should be. There are a lot of thoughts that occur followed by an additional relevant thought that has been placed several spaces below, so the ideas seem fragmented. Please don't take offense to this, I am truly trying to be helpful. 

""Family and friends still wondering if sheâ€™s ever coming back"" is not a properly worded sentence unless you put a comma behind the word in front before the sentence, making it a continuation of a thought.

 ""Her children, age 10 and 12, stayed behind with their father, so they could stay in school with their friends"". There doesn't need to be a comma behind father.

""Brendaâ€™s Son""... ""son"" doesn't need to be capitalized.

"" But given the location, right off the Zion exit, on an interstate highway, the bar also attracted weary travelers looking for a break from the road"" has too many commas. It might be better to say ""But given that the bar was located right off the highway, it sometimes attracted travelers looking to take a break from the road.""

""But as Brendaâ€™s children stood outside their fatherâ€™s house, waiting"" isn't a sentence that makes sense.â€œShe didnâ€™t show up,â€ T said. â€œDidnâ€™t show up. And finally they pulled us together and said â€˜hey we have something we need to tell you.â€™â€     .... There is a lot wrong with that whole bit. 

""Dimmer"" isn't a thing unless you're talking about a dimmer switch or something having to do with lights.

""police held a press conference with the family abut the case"".... you misspelled ""about""."

tretinoin,fc3a8zf,t1_fc37fpd,1577385245.0,Where does it say to do that?
tretinoin,fc1odb4,t1_fc1ggiv,1577324683.0,How do you do this? Iâ€™m sort of computer illiterate
30PlusSkinCare,fbug2id,t1_fbuf9hu,1577113780.0,"Do you know which ingredients break you out? Because if so, you could get one without those ingredients perhaps; thereâ€™s gotta be one that works for you! The thing is, sunscreen should be worn everyday because even if you work inside (and most of us do), youâ€™re still traveling to and from your car/public transit to get there, you might be near windows throughout the day, etc. it seems silly but those small moments really do matter. Thereâ€™s a website called Cosdna that allows you to enter the name of your product, and will tell you about each ingredient and itâ€™s side effects (someone else might have a better explanation of the site, I havenâ€™t used it in a while because I have a super solid routine that I donâ€™t mess with). You should use that and look at the ingredients of sunscreens you normally use and try to find the common ingredients which might be breaking you out. For some people itâ€™s alcohol with that biore watery essence contains. It might be that you need an alcohol free sunscreen. It might take a little trial and error but it will be worth it!"
