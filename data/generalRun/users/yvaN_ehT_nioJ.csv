KotakuInAction,fffagoe,t1_ffecxjb,1579879644.0,"I saw another good example a few days ago in a 1980s music video. 

Some Dutch musician named Taco did a cover of Irving Berlin's ""Puttin' on the Ritz."" It has a finely dressed man (Taco) dancing around with a cane singing about high-society things in the middle of a destitute, desolated inner-city. He's surrounded by the homeless and the poor and every now and then two back-up singers are given sole focus in the video and they're in black face that's very obviously in the style of minstrel shows from the time the song was first released  (a la Al Jolson in *The Jazz Singer*. )

I would say it was meant to be shocking to the average MTV viewer in the 1980s and it was certainly shocking to me today, almost 40 years after it initially aired. 

That imagery and that setting was meant to be a stark contrast to the content of the song, reminding the viewer of both the racism and the stark divide between rich and poor during the 20s and 30s.

That music video probably wouldn't fly today because the context doesn't matter anymore.

Dumbasses. So much anime isnt anywhere close to being family friendly. And there's nothing wrong with that. Anime is just a medium. If they want a family friendly con then make one geared to children's shows.

Just now noticing? We all have to start somewhere. I first started to notice it's especially leftist bent in 2012 and that shooting happened. I'm at least half way acquainted with firearms and saw their coverage was far from unbiased. Gell-Mann Amnesia effect in action. 

Last few years - since 2016, really- they've gone completely off the rails. Diversity, trans, views on the 2nd Amendment, free speech, etc. The worst example of their bias that I can think of is the show 1A (as in the First Amendment). Pure propaganda. Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me became the Orange Man Bad hour (yeah. A fucking *game show*), they unironically support Zoe Quinn (they refer to her as a victim/survivor of sexual assault) and have had her on multiple times. Guests talking about the issues pertinent to us here and kia1 present strawmen arguments or otherwise miss the claims ""conservatives"" (for NPR, that's anyone not Lefty/Democrat)...

This is essentially me plus 2 years and minus Tinder. 

The single mom thing is a dealbreaker for me. I want children of my own. I was also the kid of a dating single mom and I don't want to put kids through the same shit I had to deal with when my mom's relationships eventually fell through. It absolutely sucks when some guy trying to take the place of a dad just up and disappears out of the blue (never mom's fault of course, but I digress)
