I was having dinner with my parents at a restaurant and the waiter came to get the order. My mom asked if he was Chinese or Japanese. He said no (I don't remember but maybe Vietnamese). Then she ""explained"" her question: ""oh, I thought so because of your small eyes"" (said while pointing to her eyes and making a shape with her fingers to show how small). I wanted to make a hole on the ground and die in there. 
She was just trying to make conversation with him and had no idea this could come as offensive.  I was glad the server was really friendly and understood she was a clueless foreigner. It could have been me years ago, before I moved to Canada and became more aware of these things."

Maybe some people have the time to learn everything there is to learn about the process, but I would rather pay an expert to guide me. I bought a condo in October and my agent was a life saver. He pointed out a lot of things that would have been overlooked by me. When I felt too excited about a place that didn't exactly checked all the boxes, he kept reminding me not to rush because there is always another place on the corner that could be a better fit. I ended up with an absolutely gorgeous condo that feels like a dream. It's actually so silent that I had to put some kind of white noise in the bedroom to get used to. 
And most importantly...I was lucky that the seller was a sweet person, but I would hate to do the negotiation part with sellers. I'm not a confrontational person and I needed someone with firmer pulse."
