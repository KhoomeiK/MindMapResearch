Guitar,ffexur4,t1_fferwjn,1579869800.0,"The difference in loudness between a 20 watt amp and a 100 watt amp is about 9+ dB, barely enough to count as ""twice as loud"".  So sure a 100 watt amp is maybe 2x as loud, but I don't think you want to be in a rehearsal room with a cranked up 100-watt amp for more than a few seconds, so in practice you're probably not going to be playing it at 2x the volume.

In practice there are other factors as well, such as speaker type and EQ that might affect how loud or clear you perceive the sound to be.

To play live sure, 30-50 watts is probably just right and 100 watts why not.  For home recording you absolutely do not *need* 100 watts though.

Edit: Correction, a 100 watt is maybe 2x as loud as 10 watt amp.  Compared to a 20 watt amp, 100 watts is barely 6+ dB louder which is halfway through ""twice as loud"".  The scale is not linear so one couldn't say it's 1.5x; it's just potentially *louder*.  Whether you can even get there is another issue."

You can get more value for recording out of a smaller tube amp. Some of them come with a reactive loadbox (no cab needed) in addition to attenuation and DI connection.

If you already have cabs, look into the Engl Ironball 20, Orange Terror series, Marshall DSL20H, Jet City 22H, Laney IRT Studio. Maybe even an EVH 5150 III 50 watts, all you need is a good master volume. If you have the money, also consider a Mesa Boogie Mark V 25."
Guitar,ffeqrdh,t3_et5gti,1579860851.0,"There are more than two combinations so there's not really an ""opposite"" of what you suggest. What is a *really* good amp? A high gain boutique amp head? A Kemper? A sturdy, well built combo? You said sub $300 guitar, what about the amp? $3000?

I personally don't like really cheap guitars. They tend to not be very comfortable, have poor tuning stability and the frets and fretboard feel cheap (not to mention the hardware). At around $800 and up you get decent instruments, and with a similar budget you can get a pretty good tube amp and cab.

My choice would be a pretty good guitar (~ $1300) and a decent amp ($500 to $1000 plus cab). But if I had no choice I'd rather play a good guitar through a Boss Katana than a $300 guitar through a boutique amp."

Stories about Jesus include tales about people who *believed* such claims, they do nothing to corroborate the actual claims.

But let's play the devil's advocate for a second and pretend to accept the story. Why did god have to send his son to die? If he had no other option he's not omnipotent. If he didn't see this coming he's not omniscient. Couldn't he have made small adjustments/suggestions to improve the quality of life on Earth? Same thing with Noah's flood.

atheism,femjuqq,t3_epyiyr,1579259260.0,"any semi rational person expects and often demands evidence for most claims.  You tell someone you won a million dollars, they want proof.  You tell someone you bought a Ferrari, they want to see it.  You tell someone you are a NY Times best selling author, they also want proof.  Theists however decide to believe in god without factual evidence, based on faith.  And we're talking about a fantastic, supernatural claim!

All we atheists want is compelling evidence that can lead us to infer a god might/does in fact exist.  If such a thing existed, it would be rational to believe in a god.  I suppose an example would be if ""god"" manifested itself to people as requested and we all experienced something like that Paul did, but we should be capable of ruling out medical conditions such as a stroke, visual hallucinations, etc.  Also if prayer worked consistently and effectively with statistically significant results in a controlled experiment, including a control group (one that did not pray) and multiple experiments where people pray to different gods.  Notice however this only strongly suggests the existence of a god-like entity, which is not necessarily the god of the bible.  It might as well be a highly advanced species that can reveal itself in ways that are comprehensible to our senses but beyond our current understanding of nature  and can somehow listen to and respond to our ""prayers"".  I am not sure how to categorically conclude that it is in fact a supernatural being.

atheism,fde0nni,t3_ekqf7g,1578328507.0,"Religion is a system of dogmatic belief.  You don't question, you just accept the rules you are given.  It encourages people to suspend reason and logic in favor of supernatural thinking.  For this reason I find it inherently harmful, since it creates generations upon generations of people with atrophied cognition.  

It is well understood why religions like christianity are so popular: it hijacks existing cognitive biases (such as projecting agency unto phenomena, and classification errors) which are the product of our evolutionary history and wraps them all around a paternal figure and false promises.

I know there are ""moderate"" religious people but even in those circles you'll find elements of science denial and anti-intellectualism.  At the very least, you get people that pursue unfounded beliefs, which is at best a waste of time.

I care about social progress and education, so of course I care about what people believe and why.  I sure wish we'll get to a point in time when the majority of the world ditches irrational, unfounded beliefs and science denial, but it is also a right to assume or adopt a particular religious or political position even if it is wrong.  It is not real progress if it is imposed.  Religion should not be prohibited (unless it is some form that goes against human dignity and breaks the law), people should just outgrow it."

I think I know what you mean by ""understanding properly"" (seeing it for what it is, a system of dogmatic beliefs), but at least theologically speaking there isn't just one correct way to understand it or its particular claims.  This is what leads to bullshit and confusion and the branching out into multiple denominations.  People can however disregard all of this and understand that religious claims are unfounded and that its consequences are often immoral.

I actually disagree with this.  There are non-deistic religions and other forms of magical thinking that are, technically, compatible with the lack of belief in gods so atheism and religion are not necessarily mutually exclusive (the way theism and atheism are).  Atheism is a position about a particular issue (belief in the existence of gods) and is generally approached through skepticism (i.e. questioning and examining evidence), but simply eliminating religion does not guarantee people will not pursue beliefs in big foot, fairies, dragons, healing crystals, psychics, etc.  Likewise, you do not need to get rid of religion to *approach* atheism.  Most of us started approaching (i.e. understanding, implementing, etc.) atheism when we were still religious, as part of our growth process."

TrueAtheism,fcx6omz,t3_ejd2gs,1578053453.0,"First of all, what is ""a historical Jesus""? Some dude named Yeshua from around the first century? Or someone that more closely corresponds to the biblical claims? And if so, how close? You already stated the wild, miraculous claims are unfounded, so that leaves us with some itinerant rabbi that preached a reformed Judaism. Was one of them named Yeshua? Most likely. And then what? Why should we care and how does this even relate to the christian Jesus if he didn't do any of the ridiculous things the bible claims?

The character of Merlin was also constructed from legend, but probably based on stories about an old hermit from the forest. Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote a fairly extensive foreword to Malory's La Morte d'Arthur where he included Arthur in the genealogy of British Kings, as a historical figure. We know neither Merlin nor Arthur existed, and the fact that there might have been some Arthur and some Merlin is irrelevant to validate the historicity of the Arthur and Merlin we're talking about.

You're using documents written by people that either believed in the religion already or were reporting what people believed. This is very different from major historical figures that have records from multiple independent and contemporary sources. There is NO contemporary source for Jesus, so all we have is hearsay. You'd think the Romans would have kept impressive records of a man that cured the blind, revived the dead and turned water into wine publicly.

My point is: there is reason to accept there was some itinerant rabbi named Yeshua, but this does nothing to support THE Jesus of christian mythology.

Correction: the editor wrote the foreword to Malory's Arthur based on Geoffrey of Monmouth's book where Arthur was considered a British king. Actually makes for a better example since it's a claim and a reference to it and nevertheless it's still no more than folklore."
