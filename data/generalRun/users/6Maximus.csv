todayilearned,fc1m8o0,t1_fc1k8s2,1577322999.0,I think he was more just having fun with the universe. I don't think he gave about continuity or anything. I remember reading on Reddit a few weeks ago that he didn't how the actors pronounced Han's name so that's why it's done differently throughout the first movie.
