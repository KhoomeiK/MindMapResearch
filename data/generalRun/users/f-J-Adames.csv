As an adult I cling to my partners way too fast and make a mess out of relationships because I turn myself in to what I thought my partners wanted. 

Like you, this year I am working on becoming my own home. Turning in to who I want to be."

Codependency,fdqm6m7,t3_emqvcw,1578669975.0,"thank you I didn't know of it, i'll try it. 

If any have the opportunity I recommend the game [GRIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvECQlxrhbw) by [Nomada Studio](https://nomada.studio/).

It's an indie game that recreates the loss and grievance process. it's beautiful and very immersive. each stage touches you personally and the music and visuals are extraordinary."
Dominican,fdqlkri,t1_fdoalya,1578669581.0,"This sums it up pretty well. Veganism can only be adopted by the higher middle class citizen and high class citizen.

Something else that should be taken in consideration is that environmental awareness is not something the common citizen knows and is concerned about, only the youth living in the capital and north eastern cities of the island  have an awareness and are concerned with better ways to protect our environment.

Also the entities that try to protect out land fight against the government that tries to sell this land to the best bidder in exchange of patronage for the politicians or personal benefit."
JurassicPark,fdneep6,t3_em9jfz,1578584034.0,Great! Love the composition and color work and textures. Great job!
TooAfraidToAsk,fdkw32n,t3_els3mv,1578512356.0,"No, you are perfect the way you are. Whomever says the opposite or makes you feel the opposite is wrong and should be ashamed.

Never be ashamed of knowing your body and knowing what you like and how you enjoy yourself or any partner you may have in your life."

BreakUps,fdkbj7f,t3_elrm0i,1578500386.0,"Keep it up, you didnâ€™t fall in love in one day or a month. You are used to him and so are your routines and your body. It will take time, donâ€™t give up."
2meirl4meirl,fdk9d2s,t3_elq0rt,1578499030.0,"You donâ€™t need art to express yourself. And human beings need to express their emotions on a myriad of ways. Explore around you, based on your experiences and i am sure you will find a way to. It could be playing video games, watching a series and letting the emotions engulf you. 
Keep looking, and for the guy that said internet people that doesnâ€™t care. I donâ€™t know you but i care ðŸ’•"

depression,fdi02sc,t3_eldea8,1578433313.0,"what about things you enjoy doing on the good days. Think on ways to use those for any job, or maybe make an income form a hobby. Don't give up <3"

AskReddit,fdfqjhy,t3_el4j70,1578367791.0,"My drawing teacher passing a year and two days ago. I only had 5 months in to class with him. He was the most talented person i have ever seen, but even more than that, he knew how to pass  on that knowledge and talent.

My maternal grandmotherâ€™s passing almost a year ago. More than her departure what left a hole in my chest was seeing my mother and her siblings broken. My uncles and aunts are the jolliest of people you could meet, and in that moment that light and glee was completely gone. 
Besides that I couldnâ€™t be with my mom due to college so i feel guilty about letting her on her own.

My paternal grandmotherâ€™s passing 4 years ago. She taught me how to read. She always encouraged my curiosity. Both in arts and literature. She valued knowledge and education above everything. She still is my role model.

Realizing my father wasnâ€™t the hero I saw him as during my childhood. 

Realizing how hard it must have been for my mother to raise us all practically by herself. I am ashamed I never gave it a second thought, and now i am working on it to show her how much I appreciate all she did and still does for me."
depression,fdfkfuz,t3_el4jg2,1578363779.0,"I have never been married and my relationships have always been a mess. But the little i do know is that men do get stressed and donâ€™t express it and mostly bottle up. For someone to ask you to focus on your mental health it shows that he cares deeply for your wellbeing.

Most likely he didnâ€™t meant that and just wanted to keep playing to relax. 

You said it yourself you have achieved a lot and are way better now than a year ago. So hold on to that. 

Reality is a lot more than what we feel and how we feel. 

You are doing good and you are useful not just to keep a place clean. But because you are working on your own self. Thatâ€™s useful, not for him, or your friends. For you. Because you need yourself more than you need anyone else and more than anyone else needs you."

adultery,fbea7g1,t3_ecwmu5,1576781677.0,"I feel you deeply, I'm on a similar situation and i don't seem to find the strength either to stay away or keep it on a friendship status. I am told I should give myself some time alone, but loneliness is depressing and so is missing him knowing he will never be anything more than a married man. That i will never be the wife. I go to therapy, but i am a long way from success, and that only makes me sadder.

You are not alone."
