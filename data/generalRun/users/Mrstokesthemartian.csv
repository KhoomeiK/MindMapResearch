todayilearned,ff48i24,t3_erem32,1579557846.0,Yea man there was this one time i was playing apex and we were about to win but my game lagged out and i got kicked so...i feel her frustration.
RoastMe,fezfjy3,t3_eqrvd2,1579456837.0,It looks like you both already are doing your worst
TIL_Uncensored,fevm0ci,t3_eqepp9,1579398932.0,Maybe that's why joe elliot was asking for all that sugar to be poured on him.
RoastMe,felwmg5,t1_fejvebx,1579232776.0,Hey  that's just not right... garbage men make enough to afford better
apexlegends,fe360ek,t1_fe33wuc,1578846273.0,"Yea i know but, if thats what i have to do with apex to go cross platform i will."
apexlegends,fe34039,t1_fe15p8e,1578845712.0,Lol id much rather see solos  and duos be a regular thing before they increase the number of squads. Could you imagine capital city?? 4 - 4 man squads fighting over 3 shields and 2 guns!
todayilearned,fe33a36,t3_encyzv,1578845523.0,I still think it was just a bunch of hype. 'The Interview' was likely not to sell very well or some other reason so they hacked themselves. Im having a hard time believing nk would employ hackers to do something like that.
apexlegends,fe32orv,t3_enk8ll,1578845325.0,"I feel you bro, my girl and i play so I've usually got 2 for a premade but the guy i would use as my 3rd is on ps4. Im just patiently waiting for cross platform . As far as wraiths phase there have been a few different bugs since kings canyon. Through a combination of phasing and then starting a portal and switching weapons or something there's been a couple different ways to extend her tactical. I personally haven't run into anybody using it in game which is good ."
apexlegends,fe31gh6,t1_fe19t05,1578845013.0,"Didn't even bother trying to be constructive lmao, i don't get it."
apexlegends,fe0iu04,t3_enelcv,1578814074.0,Shed bloth! And then shed tear
RoastMe,fe0bcxf,t1_fdyweq6,1578808595.0,Ripped anus blood
apexlegends,fdzpofd,t1_fdyw66n,1578792976.0,I think the idea is if there was 1 or more squads involved in the firefight leading up to them getting eliminated and said person didnt help at all. That would justify a peak into a gold box.
BonerMaterial,fdx3vm2,t3_emzs1b,1578765032.0,"Wow, id love to find out if you can handle a night with 28 y/o former marine."
BonerMaterial,fdpg4tw,t3_emdlgd,1578627744.0,Just.. wow
BonerMaterial,fdoc2r8,t3_em9fdz,1578602468.0,"Nope , just the right length."
todayilearned,fdnsrjl,t1_fdnso5n,1578592095.0,Why didn't i think of that??
apexlegends,fdmct3h,t1_fdmbnw2,1578545803.0,Right up there with kraber headshots and thermite ticks.
apexlegends,fdm9eod,t3_em1f04,1578543102.0,I love it when they bunch up like that.
