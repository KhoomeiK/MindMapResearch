The entity protects assets by creating one more obstacle  for the thief, which is better than nothing in my book. I have been told that the vast majority of these cases are revenge. In that frame of reference, a thief may not know how or where to do a business entity search. 

In my specific context, I had been looking for ways to hide my identity behind LLC's for property ownership in case of a tenant trying to enact any kind of revenge. 

IF a tenant decided to take revenge against me, and saw an LLC, yes they could forge a deed against that LLC no problem (I stated previously that this was fraud and that anyone could do it), but they would never find my other assets if they were shielded by another LLC. Furthermore, I have a business LLC which I run my company with. I then use that LLC to create LLC's, making even one more step.

Think about this. Are you going to search for a business llc or property you don't even know exists? Are you going to search the business entity registry or the county property ownership database? Your first step when buying an investment is to shield that in an LLC. It will make it much harder for a stalker to find out exactly who are they filing against.

edit: you've got a ""Connecticut real estate attorney"" here who can't see the value of having your property in an LLC to fight this? Man, hopefully his/her clients are getting second opinions because I would fire their ass! 

Why is an LLC an important thing to have to fight these paper stalkers? Paper stalking is a revenge tactic more than anything else. If the stalker is going to enact revenge against you, and they know nothing about you except maybe you are a real estate investor, then what are they going to search for, your name or some property or business they don't even know exists???

biology,fdcax7u,t3_ekkrcs,1578270623.0,"Man if you find that hard to believe, chemical kinetics involved in DNA replication would blow your mind.

Anyway, the genome has a lot of protein machinery that correct DNA in the event there is a mutation. DNA is one of the most highly conserved molecules in the Universe that we know of. When it is bound up in chromosomes, it is a tightly wound collection of nucleosomes which are really unavailable to be mutated. Nothing really fits into the lumen between the nucleosomes. When the DNA is exposed during replication or gene expression, then it is vulnerable, but all repair machinery is there waiting to fix any problems.

Furthermore, a cell which is damaged, will be signaled to undergo apoptosis, or cellular death. This will eliminate it, and keep it from replicating. Now when there is a mutation in the genes which REGULATE apoptosis, now you're in trouble, and that is where cancer arises from. On average you will need to acquire around 7-10 of these specific mutations. I have heard that we are born with 3 epigenetic markers (not mutations) which can cause cancer. The BCRA gene which causes breat cancer is a good example of this. Some women are just born predisposed..."

Could be a tactic, he could also have something else going on you don't know about. Could be many things, because there are many ways to make money on real estate. If he is a flipper, then he probably has a plan.

Personally, if someone lowballs me, I will never even bothering counter. I had one guy offer me 50% of my home's value (not on the market), so I countered with 150% of taxable value as a slap in his face. If they just keep countering, I will then ignore them as well, even if they accept my previous offer, just to teach them a lesson. I'm not purposefully trying to be an Ahole, but at the same time, sometimes I feel as if buyers are just not reasonable. I don't know who has been giving you all this advice, but constant back and forths like that are a PITA and a waste of time, energy, and emotions. I am also a RE agent, so I'm speaking from the heart here.

I would say you were given bad advice. This is coming from someone who has been in your shoes, and your seller's shoes. You may have lost your dream home due to trying to save $10-$20/mth on mortgage payments. Always run a scenario through your head before you act on it. I don't know why anyone wouldn't do that... but if you would ran the numbers, I am sure you would have not tried to save a pittance like that. A lot of older folks especially will hammer on about ""negotiations"" but time is of the essence as they say in real estate, and there are far too many jokers out there nowadays to waste time with.

If the home is overvalued like you say, and he has not gotten any offers (how do you know that by the way, did the seller's agent tell yours?), then he may just decide to let it appreciate, and possibly even avoid capital gains if he's had it for less than 2 years. It would greatly benefit him if he did that.

I'm sorry to not shed any light on this, but truly, the seller and their agent are the only one who would know the true reason. And yes, this could be a tactic, of MANY strategies, possibly to get you off his back, or to make you worry while he accepts the offer because he got annoyed with you.

I have looked through your question a little bit more, and want to stress that the nucleosome cannot replicate DNA, as it is, by definition, a DNA molecule wrapped around a histone protein, making it unavailable to the replication machinery.

Also, during **replication,** RNA's most important role is only as tiny snippets of code, which help ""guide"" the correct signaling compounds to bind to other proteins, which then make there way to the DNA molecule (which is still bound up as a nucleosome. Then more RNA does other similar work. It is in fact extremely complicated, but scientists have a pretty good grasp of it.

I thought maybe you were thinking of a replisome by the way you asked you question. A replisome is after the DNA machinery has associated itself with the DNA molecule. This can only happen after the nucleosome's histone tails are activated through various mechanisms. This is called 'epigenetics'. Once the histone tails are modified and activated, the nucleosome structure unravels, opening the DNA up as a double helix strand, and giving room for the replisome to take shape. Hope that helps!

Obviously there is way more to this, but this is the AP Bio explanation. But no, RNA  is not present until transcription. You also have all type of RNA from guide proteins to RNA with instructions for a protein. If DNA is the 'computer' memory, then RNA is like the RAM, which is doing work.

As for tools, well, your success sounds like it may be minimal, as you should be practicing aseptic technique. You are literally raining spores, bacteria, and skin dust all over the place, everywhere you go. So by ""few tools"", you should get a clear tupperware, a lighter, a thin metal paperclip (we call these things loops in micro), a terrarium or seed starting heat mat, and mix up some agar (you'll also need an agar dish). Once it colonizes, you'll need to mix up some fresh substrate and pasteurize it, so you need all that equipment too LOL. No such thing as a ""few tools"" in mushroom cultivation."

It's already corporatized, but imagine this: You drive up to a trailhead, there is a Disney Kiosk there, with someone handing out leaflets, which are a tiny trail map full of ads and coupons, which just end up flying into the backcountry with the wind... ""Sir you can't go up there without a permit! SIR! SIR!!!"" That is the vision these people want. I also have a business in Paradise Valley, and we JUST fought off a huge goldmine which was proposed on the Park's northern boundary... We will continue this fight, and if we fail, well then I will just visit the other 20 million acres of the GYE, and avoid Yellowstone altogether. This privatization of public lands is disgusting to me.

I plan on doing a more leisurely trip with my wife at another time, but I really just wanted to get it done and cross it off my list."
FindingFennsGold,fcxy7pt,t1_fcxg00u,1578072097.0,"Thanks! I've been exploring out here for 17 years, and worked in Yellowstone for 5 years at Lake and Mammoth. I did not search this past year because business is booming out here, but next summer I have a spot which I am going to hit up with a metal detector. I was actually contacted by a searcher, or someone making a documentary on this site. He wanted to come film me on a search, so I said YES OF COURSE. Well, he backed out, and ruined my plans, even though I pushed my trip back for him. (Hope you're reading this dude!)

This will be my 10th year, and my location hasn't changed since day 1. Am I wrong? Dunno, but I haven't seen any other convincing solves. Not even close! To me, every single clue points to my location, but my location is actually huge, and looks like that in the picture. 

I freely post my solves, (because they are impossible for most searchers) and thoughts, so here is another one. I believe that the chest used to be on the ground, sheltered by a hummock, in a dry creek bed (or seasonal stream which almost all dry creek beds out here are in springtime) so possibly, only 1/2 visible from an approaching searcher. Then over time, the ground eroded around it, covering it. I have seen like 5 feet of earth slide off a hill in a few minutes, so a few inches of soil is almost a certain thing. SO, I am going to sweep this one particular area, and hopefully haul it out next summer. 

I really enjoy this sub, and basically have no one to talk with about the treasure around here, as they think I am nuts, but treasure hunting of all sorts is my hobby, and I have been successful in finding cool things out in the mountains, so I keep at it: 

But again, here are the clues, of which I am almost certain: the blaze is a slash mark on a tree indicating a route or object or something of interest. If you were to see a blaze off-trail, that would be highly unlikely in the backcountry. The poem involves 2-3 DIFFERENT bodies of water. A warm river, cold river, and either a shallow creek or dry creek bed. I do believe you can walk to this spot without risking your life doing a river crossing, but an old man would have some trouble getting to the spot on foot with a chest without crossing this river. The house of Brown is close to my spot (looking like a literal brown house), and brown trout inhabit this particular location, and they are pretty rare here, although they have spread upstream from where we stock them (this was not a problem in 2010 as much as now). Lots and lots of brown bear out there too, so all those seem to line up with the house of brown clue. 

Anyways, I hope that helps, good luck ya'll!

realestateinvesting,fcwsi6d,t1_fcwrd2j,1578035824.0,"Commercial property is more volatile than residential. Everyone needs housing, even in a down market, but tenants in commercial property go out of business even in up markets. This leads to higher interest rates, and more exposure to the bank, as an investor is trying to put as little of their money into the project as possible.

That's the biggest reason, but other reasons I have seen, as a real estate agent, include liens on property from businesses after a lawsuit. Not going to get that financed very easily.

Otherwise, a residential loan is secured by the Fed in many cases (FHA, VA, Rural, etc), while commercial doesn't have that in my experience. I finally got a loan based on the prime rate, according to my bank, and it was a business loan at 5%, interest + principle, amortized over 20 years... That's kind of a lot, but I am told it is a good commercial rate. Nowadays a good residential rate is below 4%."

You can even do mixed use, and live/work type condos, and those don't even hit the market where I live, before they are sold. 

Cashflow, if you can run a business out of your unit is insane compared to residential. Even commercial rent is crazy. I can rent at $12/sqft on a metal building which costs $30k finished. Highly recommend commercial real estate."
