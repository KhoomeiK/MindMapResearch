All I can really recommend is feeding the curiosity and letting it take you wherever it takes you. Personally, I got into watches after I was gifted a relatively inexpensive mechanical watch, and being the fidgety person I am I was fascinated with all the moving gears and the tactile experience of winding a watch or listening to the rotor spin. 

That transitioned into my purchase of a relatively inexpensive automatic watch with a clear caseback so I could observe all the inner workings. As I got more curious I googled more, learned more, and got more curious and it kind of spun out of control from there."
Watches,ff3oca1,t3_er7img,1579545353.0,"It's less that there's anything wrong with quartz, but rather the work and design that goes into making a proper, working purely mechanical watch. The more you learn about it and the more you get into the hobby, the more you realize how difficult yet beautiful a mechanical watch is. 

That being said, true watch lovers don't discount a watch just because it's quartz. It's more about the whole package. It just so happens that when you appreciate mechanical watches, that they get much more praise and appreciation. This doesn't discount the truly impressive watches like the Bulova Accutron watches, just because they aren't mechanical.
