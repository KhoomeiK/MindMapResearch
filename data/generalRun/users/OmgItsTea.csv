offmychest,feq1gdk,t3_epyqf2,1579336074.0,"I wouldn’t stress it I had gotten into a serious relationship started at 21 ended when I was 27

I wish I never dated her in my 20s or ever and everything I built and worked hard for was ruined because of her I had to move far away and quit my job after she cheated on me and dumped me

I had to start from square one all over again, so don’t rush into anything until you know they are the one. 
It’s been  almost 4 years from the break up and I’m still working on building myself back up for me and no one else."
