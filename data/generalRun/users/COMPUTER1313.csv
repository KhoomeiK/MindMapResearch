> When the compound is allowed migrate with a loose joint the thermal load increases(concentrates) on the contact area in tandem with the loss of the compound.

If you're going with the AMD route, there is no reason to get an X570 if you don't need PCI-E 4.0 or the extra connectivity. A X470/B450 with lots of VRMs would be sufficient if you're primarily gaming and using an aftermarket cooler. OCing is very limited on Zen 2 due to how aggressively it boosts, short of throwing almost infinite cooling and VRMs at it to make manual OCing worth it.

As for the CPU, 8C/16T should be enough for another few years as it will take a bit of time for the console developers to start specifically optimizing games for a ~3.5 GHz 8C/16T Zen 2 CPU after the new consoles launch. In fact, if you plan on upgrading to Zen 3 in the future instead of just using a Zen 2 until AMD/Intel is well into DDR5, a 6C/12T CPU would be sufficient until that upgrade.

If you're willing to wait until Intel's 10th gen show up, I'd also expect more price drops from AMD during that wait. For example, the Ryzen 3600 that used to cost about $200 at launch is now going for $150-$180."

To do list:

- ~~Figure out what to do with the empty land after dezoning the old ore and agricultural industry area that was rendered obsolete by the new industry areas built with the Industries DLC. Probably more residential area with a 4th major office cluster between the highway and forest (which will be another park). And build a direct underground highway link from the now underutilized DCMI to the seaports.~~

- ~~Completely overhaul the rail network to separate passenger and cargo trains.~~ I used the ""Optimize Outside Connection"" mod to set the passenger trains to delay spawning by 10x (which is the max and the default is 4x), yet I still keep getting passenger trains with single digits passengers clogging up the rail lines.

- Expand seaport with a third seaport, funnel the oil/generic industry's cargo train exports to the seaports, and dress it up to make it more realistic.

- ~~Build two more subway stations in Daffodi Heights (the island) now that it has been mostly rezoned to high density residential.~~

- Try to build over/under left-turn bypasses in the new industrial areas to reduce the intersection congestion? Not exactly sure how to deal with the crushing cargo traffic. I've tried a large roundabout and even with TMPE lane manager, it buckles from the traffic.

- Custom airport

- Realistic waterfront (no idea where to begin finding assets to start that).

4chan had the best explanation that I found so far: https://yuki.la/g/66677606

A few samples from that thread:

> In 2013, Intel was late. The Self Aligned Dual Patterning (SADP) required by the feature size of 14nm had a bad learning curve, yields were very bad at first, to the point where Broadwell was mostly a paper launch in 2014, 2 quarters behind schedule. This was not a critical problem and it was fixed gradually, such that Skylake was not delayed. Behind the scenes though, the long ramp time created a problem. As Intel has only a single (large) process development team, not leapfrogging teams, the 14nm delay led to a delay of 10nm. The specifications it would shoot for were not set in stone until 2014.

> Managers gave them a difficult task. To win mobile they had to be power efficient and dense. To win desktop they needed to be fast. To win servers they needed excellent yields. And above all they needed to be better than the competition to attract new customers.
Inorder to reach the goals set by management, the manufacturing group had to get creative. To that end a number of techniques never put into a production process before were adopted. COAG, SAQP, Cobalt, Ruthenium Liners, Tungsten contacts, single dummy gate, etc. This push is directly what led to the death of the process. Of those, only really COAG and Cobalt are causing the issues. I'll go into the specific problems next post.


> The idea with Contact Over Active Gate is that instead of extending a gate such that it connects up with a contact to the side (thus using space on the side), the Contact stretches directly from the metal layer to the gate, rather than laying ontop the substrate. This means there is NO room for error on manufacturing. The slightest misalignment leads to fucked contacts. Thermal expansion, microvibrations from people walking nearby, changes in air pressure, imagine a cause, and it'll affect yields. I bet you the bloody position of the Moon can affect it.
This kills the yields.

> To hit the targets Intel set, a minimum metal pitch of 36nm was selected. When you have Copper wires on a process they need to have a liner around them, this prevents diffusion, electromigration, and other nasty electrical fun. But this liner needs to be a certain thickness, so when the overall size of the wire gets smaller, the liner takes up a larger portion of it. Below 40nm it was thought that Cobalt would have superior electrical properities, despite it having a higher bulk electrical resistance. Its far more resistant to electromigration and needs a miniscule barrier to prevent it, while its resistance decreases at a slower rate as the wire size gets smaller.

> However, Intel overlooked two key problems: ductility/malleability, and thermal conductivity. Even at those tiny levels, Copper wires would be able to handle thermal expansion mechanical loads, bending and stretching ever so slightly as a processor made its rounds. And copper is Very good at transferring heat, letting the lower metal layers sink heat into the upper ones. Meanwhile Cobalt is hilariously brittle and has a sixth the thermal conductivity as Copper. On operation hot spots start to form, heat can't get away, brittle nature creates microfractures, and higher voltage to cross the fracture boundaries. Means the voltage/frequency curve is hilariously bad.

> This kills the performance and power usage.

> If anyone is to blame, its the management, and their firing of the CEO with a bullshit reason shows the board will not accept responsibility for the companies failings. They will not come clean in the foreseeable future. Their foundries are virtually dead after all the firings and cost cutting.

> So where does it leave us at?
10nm was meant to launch end of 2015, after 14nm this was pushed to 2016. It is now Q3 2018 and the only 10nm chip is a minuscule dual core made in a one-off batch of 100k units that took 6 months to assemble. **Yields are sub 1%, the GPU doesn't function, and power usage is higher than 22nm.**

And another comment, although there's no way to confirm it:

>  I can't go too deep into it because work is prickly about revealing secrets but there was a serious change between 32nm and 22nm that just made everything more complicated, like four to six times more complicated. if you want a simple answer to what is wrong with Intel it is that no one in upper management wanted to be at the helm when Moore's Law officially ended and instead of working smarter upper management opted to work faster, harder. this is never a good idea and the policies they put in place were punishing and resulted in some of our best engineers getting burnt out. seven day a week task force meetings, waking people at all hours for stupid reasons, demanding unreasonable deadlines, etc. when BK was put in charge I was thrilled that someone who worked as an engineer in development would be in charge. what I didn't foresee was that upper management would be packed with people that also worked in engineering... twenty years ago and don't understand it doesn't work like that anymore. also, good engineers are not necessarily good managers. it feels like instead of measure twice and cut once we switched to cut 100 times then measure all that shit for a while there which was just infuriating (I measure things). it is getting a bit better."
