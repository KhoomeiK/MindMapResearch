* You need white, black, Mephiston red and Regal blue. Also: white primer. Get a dollar store matt acrylic primer to save you $10 bucks. LukesAPS has a great YouTube video on using cheaper primers.

* Assemble the models. Glue dried dirt to the base for texture.

* Prime them white. After drying, give them another quick blast from above with white. This enhances the white as one coat usually turns out grey.

* Thin down some black paint 50/50 with water. Paint it as a thick wash over all the parts you want black. The raised areas will remain lighter, giving you a Contrast Paint effect. Not dark enough? Two coats!

* Same for grey stuff. Mix white and black to grey, make a thick wash, do the grey parts. Also paint the gyro things grey. You can make several tones depending on the amount of black and white in the mix.

* Paint all the red parts red. Paint the feet and bare heads blue. 

* Take a bottle cap of water, and a literal pinprick of detergent / dishwash soap to it. This acts as a homemade flow improver.

* Add black to the blue and red, and add the flow improver. About 25% paint to 75 percent flow improver. Use this mix to wash the red and blue. Make sure to move the wash to the recesses.

* Make the same 25/75 mix with black. Use this to line the panels and create black lines between distinct parts of the model.

* Edge highlight the white armor with white, correct mistakes made while panel lining at the same time.

* Paint the eye lenses as usual. Start with black, layer over with lighter tones of blue, made by mixing white into blue.

* Mix black into red until you get an earthy tone. Use this to paint the base.

* Optional: all the black, grey, white and blue parts can be highlighted by mixing progressively more white into the base color.

Pro's of this method: fast, cheap, tabletop ready.

Con's: will not be the prettiest, colors will look a bit desaturated due the use of whites and blacks.

Second option: easier color scheme in full blue. Paint them completely blue, black guns dark blue wash, orange lenses, done."

wholesomememes,fdjpi3q,t1_fdjpdpq,1578482273.0,"They actively acknowledge At the Gates as their main inspiration. They're at least half of both : ) They get thrown in with Deathcore because of the breakdowns / mosh and the fact that their popularity rose at the time Deathcore was the hot new thing in metal land.

wholesomememes,fdjog6x,t1_fdjj5xr,1578480838.0,"Hate being a terrible metal niche hipster but... Melodic Death Metal has nothing to do with clean vocals. The genre seperates itself by having more melodic guitar lines. Most of the originators of the genre do not have clean vocals. At the Gates' 1996 'Slaughter of the Soul' is the quintessential album imo. The modern interpretation on albums by The Black Dahlia Murder is also stellar, start with 'Miasma'."
minipainting,fdjmuzq,t1_fdjh1n0,1578478572.0,"From purely a painting perspective, absolutely. It will grow a lot this decade. Though I expect not everyone will want a 3d printer. You need time, money, space, maintenance, etc. That's not for everyone."
minipainting,fdjgcf7,t1_fdizv9v,1578469600.0,"This. If you want to play at GW stores, tournaments, painting competitions, other events, you'll need the official models. Perhaps 3d printing will make game systems that allow for 3rd party models more popular, and in turn make GW games less popular. But, they have a pretty hard grip on the market right now. For me it's also childhood nostalgia, the lore and universe, the smell of the store. It's the first love you can't let go, no matter what assholes they can be sometimes."
minipainting,fdjf5dv,t3_elp8rm,1578468187.0,"Should work, inks tend to be somewhat transparent. They preserve a lot of the highlights underneath while tinting the colors. Thinning them can change the effect. It can take some experimentation to get right, so maybe practice on something textured else first. Tie wraps or screw plugs are cheap options for testing."
