i though all this discussion start from electronic voting, aka no paper trail (and tom scott is very clear on that if i remember correctly); the proposal in the paper is very clearly based on paper trail.  
I am aware there are hybrid technique that could be better, but they are are more a paper-crypto rather than an electronic voting (i am pretty sure you can solve them by hand relatively easily), but AFAIK none of them is applied in real life and are not what people talk about with ""electronic voting"".  
  
So yes, if we talk about e2e may better, but e2e is not electronic voting, as the main verification system is based on paper trail and can (should) be done without any machine at all. Also, would a machine that scan the normal paper ballot ""electronic voting""?

As a party representative, I know once the piece of signed paper is in the box, it will be exactly the same as will come out.

We don't see it as end user, as wsg84 is good enough for driving and for the next 100 years you may have only error of some meter, but if we talk about pyramids build like 6000years ago you have to compensate for the drift, unless those Egyptian did for us and told us the time information like ""in 2020 take the speed of light and that will be our latitude"".

The prime meridian is the Greenwich meridian, that simply took over in late 1800 because at the time English where the more spreader out empire and was used for navigation, thus very important for them to have all navigation map aligned.

rust,fdrsnon,t1_fdqidf3,1578689088.0,"> How do you handle collections?

depends what you mean for ""handle"", but generally after you decide a reasonable amount of RAM to allocate, exactly like you would use normal collection

HOW YOU MAKE THEM:  
You give an hard limit, in general in embedded you create a static array with fixed size and build your collection over there.  
A custom allocator may be used, or you may use custom collection.
  
WHAT YOU DO WHEN THE SPACE IS OVER   
How do you deal those situation in the program you wrote? Probably you didn't, and you would panic.

> hit issues with the stack limit there

same as how your normal program would handle those cases. Also, as long as you diont have recursive call, technically you can calculate your worst case scenario stack usage on compilation, but never seen nothing about it"

Also scrolling down I fond the video, and is clear the top basically broke off like starship, on the weld that keep the upper dome (the one collapsed) but because water was used, it has not been as enegertic, and not all the weld failed.
