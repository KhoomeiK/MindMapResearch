The language of Parfit is that of a life ""barely"" worth living. But that's misleading language when you are talking about lives that have a positive utilitarian value, albeit small positive value. Anything marginally above the level of zero value is positive and good. 

Of course the task of setting this zero-level threshold is the normative judgement that has to be made, and would cause great disagreement, but the important thing to remember is that given an accepted threshold of positive utility, those who have positive utility relative to the threshold of positive/negative will be living a life that is better to be living than to not be living.

Why would a single claim from a perpetrator be adduced as legal evidence at face value? There would be psychological analysis; you know this, right? 

If the perpetrator of the physical acts which constitute the crime of murder is **found by the court to have been in psychosis**, then you one would look at the causation of that psychosis. Different jurisdictions may require the court to consider, for example, whether drugs were knowingly self-administered by the defendant and, if so, may preclude a finding of insanity as a defence. 

Other reasons, such as a finding that the defendant was the victim of serious crimes committed by another, and the psychosis has resulted from that conduct, may not preclude a finding of insanity as a defence.

**So in short,** a claim that the physical acts undertaken by the defendant were directly caused by psychosis induced by the actions of another, if those facts are adduced as admissible evidence, may very well work as a defence! Yes.
