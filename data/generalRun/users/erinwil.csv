gradadmissions,feaeii9,t1_fdzxfoz,1578947700.0,Do they look at Gen Ed’s or electives at all? I have a bunch of Ws on my transcripts but they were from gen Ed/elective courses. My major courses are good.
GradSchool,fdwl5kl,t1_fdwh2vl,1578759840.0,I’m not 100% set on which master’s program I want to go into (I’m still in undergrad). I’m just talking about master’s programs in general.
NoStupidQuestions,fdk5m1j,t1_fdk3zs1,1578496599.0,Because they grew up in a time period when mental illness was viewed as a weakness and not an actual illness. I’m not speaking for all of them. That’s why I said ON AVERAGE. Lol.
college,fdcfb96,t3_ekkdhe,1578273492.0,"For it to be reliable, it would depend on how many reviews the professor has. If a professor has, lets say, 20 reviews and most of them are good then you assume that the professor is good."
college,fdceuul,t3_ekkl9t,1578273178.0,"If I were you, I would go with Ohio because it’s affordable."
college,fdceffy,t3_ekluz7,1578272879.0,I feel ya. Next semester all my classes are scheduled MWF as well. Are there any places on campus where you can relax?
college,fd6lqv2,t1_fd6lgyj,1578192847.0,"A provider is a health professional (psychiatrist, counselor, psychologist, etc)."
college,fd6jx2f,t3_ek6rnf,1578192169.0,Yes you definitely should get documentation from a provider. It will make the appeal much more likely to happen.
college,fd6dnnd,t3_ek5ooj,1578189378.0,You should take a withdrawal or leave of absence to work on yourself. Many students do that. You can always go back. They will let you back in as long as you’re in good academic standing and don’t have a disciplinary record. And make sure you’re seeing a mental health professional.
college,fczwd7o,t1_fczeh1j,1578109745.0,"Are there any electives you can take? I don’t know how it works your school but at my school, unless a student has a minor or is double majoring, they are required to take 30 credits in electives to have 120 total."
college,fczdh5o,t3_ejor1j,1578098743.0,You should get on the waitlist and email the professors to see if they could get you into the class. I have had professors who did that. A class of mine had 40 spots but there ended up being 42 students.
college,fcx89nw,t3_ejbpwv,1578055174.0,"Honestly, high school was the worst 4 years of my life. College is much better."
college,fcwk7tm,t3_ejafdq,1578027893.0,"Focus on getting good grades. If you want to get into the ‘best colleges’, you need to be a top student."
college,fcwjv4z,t1_fcwilqr,1578027604.0,"Not always true. Some people choose ‘worthless’ majors so they can maintain a good GPA to get into grad school. Even if you choose a science degree like Biology, you usually still need a masters to get a well paying job. And I personally know a biology graduate working as a waitress.."
college,fcw4ay9,t3_ej7a30,1578016825.0,You need documentation from a provider.
college,fcw2do1,t3_ej7r2z,1578015550.0,"I wouldn’t recommend doing that. If you’re in college, you already know that most professors don’t do grade bumps."
college,fcsmd52,t3_eip1ux,1577919621.0,Awesome! That’s a great engineering school.
college,fcrrnf8,t3_eiksx0,1577905692.0,University of Vermont. They have a good business school.
college,fcrqxw6,t3_eil9h3,1577905422.0,The only one I know of is Purdue University Global. It’s part of Purdue University.
NoStupidQuestions,fcqaklq,t1_fcq9mxh,1577882210.0,Good answer!
college,fcnnk02,t1_fcnfja6,1577814870.0,Have you ever ended up with bad professors?
college,fclh7dr,t3_ehrm3s,1577747714.0,"Go to a big school. At a big school, you have tons of options when you sign up for classes so you can avoid many of the bad professors."
college,fclgn9k,t3_ehrtzg,1577747340.0,College relationships usually don’t last which is why a lot of students are just into hookups.
college,fclg7bg,t3_ehs4so,1577747047.0,Do things you like to occupy your time while seeking treatment.
college,fclbd4q,t1_fcl65ve,1577743908.0,"I agree that 16,000 is way too overpriced. For my sophomore year, I lived on campus and had a single dorm all to myself. I only had to pay 4K per semester."
college,fcl5t43,t3_ehs6oe,1577740434.0,"If you live off campus, you don’t pay room and board for the school. You pay the landlord rent. Unless you are required to live on campus, you can ask them to cancel it."

college,fcimakj,t1_fcifcex,1577664949.0,That’s strange. There are usually loans in your financial aid package.
college,fcidu5o,t1_fci4gxx,1577661064.0,FAFSA
college,fci4319,t3_eh98vd,1577657536.0,"You could get federal loans. Other than that, you need a co-signer to get loans from private companies if you don’t have good credit history. If you can’t afford the school you’re at, you should considering transferring to a CC to complete your gen Ed’s."
mentalhealth,fchnln1,t1_fchhnd3,1577652094.0,"Yes antidepressants do work but for most people, they don’t erase all the symptoms. They just keep you alive. Source: personal experience"
depression,fcffqlb,t1_fcfejeb,1577629532.0,There’s difference between being depressed about something and having a depressive disorder. What you’re describing is being depressed about how pointless life is but it’s not a depressive disorder. A depressive disorder is a disease.
depression,fcfd7p1,t3_eh6aac,1577628838.0,Fake news. Fake news. Fake news. Depression is a disease.
college,fccby8x,t3_eh1otc,1577596656.0,There’s a subreddit called r/gradadmissions. You could find people there who are on the same boat.
college,fcbp4ec,t1_fcbk7ax,1577589414.0,"It depends on the individual. Being on the dean’s list can be helpful for those aiming to get an internship. And for those who are applying to grad school, being on the dean’s list can improve their chances of admission."

college,fcaf8k4,t3_egwgq0,1577568220.0,OMG so many typos. I typed this too fast. I fixed them.
college,fc9jo74,t3_egngws,1577553658.0,Have you thought about going to graduate school? You could get a masters in something like homeland defense or cyber security. There aren’t many jobs for people with a criminology bachelors.
mentalhealth,fc97mtm,t3_egisf7,1577548322.0,"You will take longer to graduate and that’s okay. I was even kicked out of college once due to depression. I was expressing suicidal ideation and the college made me take a health withdrawal, a temporary leave of absence. They told me to 
get better and then come back. I took the rest of the semester off to work on myself. I ended up transferring and started at a new school spring semester. I decided to not let my problems hold me back and I am graduating in 3 semesters with honors. College isn’t a race. You will get there when you get there."
mentalhealth,fc8djo6,t1_fc7m3h7,1577532494.0,"You do have a point. Sitting at home being miserable probably isn’t going to help me in any way. I don’t have friends and it’s hard for me to maintain friendships or relationships (as you can guessed, due to my anxiety) and the only time I socialize with people on most days is in a professional setting, like at college (I’m 22). I don’t exercise per se but I do go out for a walk everyday around my neighborhood and that’s something. But I have to say it’s really amazing how you found a way to pull yourself out of depression."
college,fc7gh3m,t3_egjm1m,1577506710.0,Either go random or choose someone you’re not friends with.
college,fc7gb3p,t3_egkspd,1577506568.0,"They like students who don’t come in late, are always participating in class and don’t make up sob stories."
mentalhealth,fc7b3ga,t1_fc78lis,1577502328.0,"Yes I’m in the US. I know it’s rare that a psychiatrist would do talk therapy but mine does. Mine actually takes the time to understand her patients on a deeper level. All my appointments are 30 min. She talks to me in a way that allows me to open up to her, unlike the therapists I have seen the past. She admitted that she isn’t a therapist but she has no problem with providing therapy as part of her job. I started seeing her for medication about 4 years ago but we have only started doing talk therapy for 2 years."
mentalhealth,fc786em,t1_fc71cwi,1577500101.0,"I don’t have a therapist per se, but I do have a psychiatrist who acts as my therapist. I see her twice a month. I used to see actual counselors and psychologists but I weren’t able to develop a good relationship with any of them so I gave them up. They made me felt worse and I always dreaded seeing them. As for now, psychiatrist is okay with providing me talk therapy in addition to medication and we have a great relationship and she actually understands me. She’s a gem."
mentalhealth,fc72j7q,t1_fc71uyj,1577495815.0,"I never said that. I said that if your depression is chronic like mine, you will likely need to remain on medication for the rest of your life. If your depression is mild or moderate, you probably won’t. And I do respond to medication but if I ever stop taking them, I will end up in a mental hospital. I’m not one of those people who have the privilege of going off antidepressants until the day I die. It’s like a life sentence for me because I have to do life-long treatment but it’s not like that for most people. Medication is what keeps my brain living. I should also add that my brain doesn’t work like most people. It’s different, but not in a good way. I should add that antidepressants sometimes only temporarily fixes your brain. Once you stop the medication, there’s a chance your brain will go back to a depressive state forcing you to start all over. Most people aren’t like that so they’re lucky. They can stop, be symptom free and won’t need medication ever again."
mentalhealth,fc6smp2,t1_fc6rlbq,1577488452.0,The goal isn’t to be cured. The goal is to find a treatment plan that works for you so you can live a normal life.
college,fc6sc56,t3_egg47j,1577488239.0,"I didn’t take an intro to literature class but I did take a class called British Literature my freshman year for a Gen Ed. Like any other English class, it’s all reading and writing. If you enjoy reading literature, it won’t be too bad."
college,fc6rrt7,t1_fc6prdr,1577487823.0,"There are tons of options. Pharmacy school, nursing school, dental school, PT school, law school. You could even go for your MBA. Fun fact: my current dentist was a biology major in college."
college,fc6qwtg,t3_egi6b6,1577487203.0,You would have to pay the international tuition which is still very expensive. You might as well go to a state school. I can guarantee you that paying the international tuition is nowhere near cheap.
college,fc6psk9,t3_egfcph,1577486417.0,Many colleges offer full ride merit scholarships to high achieving students. You could also apply for private scholarships online.
college,fc6phrk,t3_eghwsn,1577486203.0,Not much without an advanced degree. You could always work in a lab but I don’t know if that’s what you want to do.
college,fc6oz8x,t3_egdjr9,1577485836.0,"I was never close with any of my professors. They just need knew that I worked hard and was a good student. That’s what gave me good recommendations when I transferred. If you are a good student, they will be more than happy to write you a recommendation even if you aren’t close to them. Also, I suggest that you ask recommendations from classes where you got an A in (if you have any As)."
mentalhealth,fc6n5x5,t1_fc6m6wx,1577484549.0,Therapy can help with major depression too. You learn coping skills. It’s also nice to have someone to talk to. And you know how in psych wards they make patients attend daily groups for coping skills? Therapy is basically the same thing but it’s outpatient.
