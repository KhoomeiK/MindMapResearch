There was the sound of running water, but being unable to see, I decided not to move for fear of falling in.

There was a light in the distance, dim and flickering.

""Um... hello?"" I called into the dark, unsure of where I was. My last memory being of pain and surprise, but I couldn't pinpoint exactly what had happened, and had no idea how I'd gotten here.

Wherever here was.

The light moved closer, and eventually resolved itself to be a lantern upon a small boat, and a hooded figure was illuminated at the far end.

I waited until the boat came to a stop at the bank, and then edged closer. When I was but a footstep away, the figure stood.

""Uh... hi! Um... you wouldn't happen to know where I am would you?""

They didn't answer. I couldn't see their face, which creeped me out, but a hand slowly extended towards me, as though asking for something.

""Uh...?"" What did I do now? I had no idea. Until a terrifying memory crossed my mind. If this was who I thought it was, I was fucked. 

""Oh shit, I'm dead. I'm dead aren't I? Oh fuck! What happened, I don't remember.""

The figure seemed content to let me ramble and panic, but their hand stayed raised and unmoving. After I'd calmed down again, I stepped right to the edge.

""Are you... Charon? The ferryman?""

The figure shifted slightly, but still did not speak, and though I had no answer, I was certain I was right.

I would need to pay the toll. 

Do the dead even have money? I rummaged around in my pockets for change, and found myself in luck.

""Let's see here... one, two, three, four... and... thirty-two. Four pounds and thirty-two pence."" Turning to the boatman, I held out the coins toward their open hand, and carefully deposited the change onto his palm. 

""Is... is that enough? I don't have any more.""

The money disappeared within the deep folds of the cloak, and they sat down once more. 

Nothing more happened, so with a quick glance around, I clambered into the boat. Before I'd even settled into a seat, it was moving swiftly through the deep waters. 

""So uh... you wouldn't happen to speak English would you?"" 

Silence.

""Oh... I'm SO fucked..."""

offmychest,fej0b8l,t1_feiz5ak,1579152385.0,"Yeah, you might be lucky, and get a great job right out of the gate, but you're not guaranteed one.

If you get out of education, then have a large gap of a year, potential employers will ask you, what were you doing for that year. 

Saying, ""Oh, I didn't want to flip burgers because it's such low end crap, so I sat on my ass just thinking about getting a job one day."" Makes you look lazy.

I have interviewed many people for many of the different jobs I've worked, and someone who has a resume that shows they've held down a job, no matter how shitty, for a while, is always a better candidate than someone who refuses to work until they get their dream job.

Allowances are of course made for those who are just out of education, with this potentially being their first job. But having experience is something that is a great boost to your chances. 

Well done for completing your education, yes, but just because you were able to go to school/college and complete your studies isn't enough for some people. 

Work, and education are different. Proving you're smart enough to pass an exam means nothing to so many people.

I have a qualification in Architecture, but with out experience in that field, no one is going to hire me to design their house. So you start small and build your way up.

Make the coffee and do the lunch runs. Then you move up into filing, into tiny corrections, into basic sketch ideas, into being trusted enough to assist on someone else's project, to finally being given a project of your own.


I've been out of work for 4 years now, due to having children and being a single mum. A gap of that size is going to bring up questions. For some people, ""I was raising my children"" isn't a good enough 'excuse' for not working. Having anything to do, is better than nothing, even if it's part time flipping burgers. I am more likely to be employed in a more desirable position than if I continued doing no work."

You get to experience something new. You get experience doing real work. And most importantly of all, you prove to your future employers, that you CAN work.

My mum bumped into mil in the stores, and asked her if she could double check what time I was going to be coming home. She was hoping I'd be home early enough for dinner that night.

I'm kinda germaphobe when it comes to that, and it freaks me out enough that I don't want anything in the pack anymore.

Asking for a new pack is useless, because you'll just get told it was your tooth prints, and you're trying to get free sweets/candy."
breakingmom,fdtrivv,t3_en1jmu,1578721073.0,"My first daughter, when she had just learned to sit up, was sitting next to me on the sofa. Her toy got chucked to the floor, and as I leaned down to pick it up, she flys head first towards the ground.

I have no idea how, but I grabbed her ankle before she could wack her head off the hardwood floor.

Motherly reflexes I guess"
breakingmom,fdsdvui,t1_fdsdmuj,1578700427.0,"There were times I literally ran across the house, hoping she'd be distracted, and practically dove into the bathroom like I was in an action movie, just so I could pee like my life depended on it, and get back before she noticed, having been needing to go for about 3 hours already.

It's practically an Olympic sport at that point lol"

The handle is flipping up and down, the door itself, rattling like a hoard of the undead was trying to get to me, and the distinct wail we all recognize.


""MUMMY!!!!!""



I just wanted to pee..."

If she's in the clear, there's no need to take it out on her of course."

FanFiction,fdhkd5v,t3_eldnlw,1578424491.0,"When I have ideas, and there are many, I tend to write them like a small prompt so I dont forget them like;

'Person A has accident and needs help. Their rival Person B is made to help them. They hate each other and make like difficult for each other. Slowly they begin seeing each other for who they really are. Lovey dovey stuff.'

Then I can build from there, expanding the prompt bit by bit till it's more like a small plot synopsis. From there I find it easier to flesh out."

AskReddit,fdhdxaf,t3_elbejj,1578420634.0,"When I was 19, one of my good friends, aged 21, died of a brain aneurysm. He was just in his door, complaining of a headache, and then he fell.

Doctors apparently said he was dead before he hit the floor.

I'd been given the news at 11pm.

At 9am I walked into work and my manager said to me;

""Cheer up! You look like someone died.""

I could only respond with, ""Someone just did!"" Before I burst into tears and hid in the break room for a few minutes to try and recover. 

I saw the look on his face before I cried, and he looked horrified by the situation. 

All the same, I HATE people telling me to ""Cheer up."" 

I'm clinically depressed with chronic anxiety on top. If it was that easy I'd have done it already. Let alone having a 'legitimate' reason to feel sad."
