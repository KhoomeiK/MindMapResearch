Blueberry, Buckeye Purple, Mendo Purps, Red Dragon, Master Kaze (Mr Nice seeds), Phantom Cookies...all very pretty, but the smoke was nothing to write home about. OK, the BB was fantastic, but still not super potent.

If you can get the Golden Goat clone, DO IT. I wish I could get it out where I'm at, I'd grow nothing but. As I recall, it's a ISSxRomulan. Wow! Really potent! And I thought it was a real pretty plant. There are a couple breeders working with it, seeds are available. Um...Rasta Jeff I think? Irie Seeds?

Hmmm...the Deathstar clone I had was so potent, I had to stop growing it, it actually made me sweat and it made my friends' pulses race. Hands down the most potent stuff I've grown in years. A few breeders have worked with it. I'd check Karma...Idunno who else.

SAGE (THSeeds) I know, old school, but I've heard the seedline hasn't changed over the years, it's still the same. If that's the case, damn...there are phenos in there (11-12 weekers) that are devastating, downright psychedelic smoke. Very beautiful, delicate buds. For sure it is a more intermediate+ level plant.

I smoked some Biker Kush a few weeks back that blew the back of my skull out. Reeeal potent OG, another Karma strain.

For sheer raw daywrecking potency, though, it's hard to beat a good Sour D or vicious, gassy OG. Good luck!"

I can for sure grow some bud in the corner of the dining room, in the fall/winter, anyway, with nothing but water and neglect. With good genetics, it'll even be good smoke.

But it won't be saleable, for example, in any sense--it'll be sparse, scrappy larf, and not much of it, either. I've seen man-sized plants in scenarios like this make less than an ounce of smokeable ""bud.""

All the qualities *other* than general potency and cannabinoid profile are thanks to environment and nutrient ratios, no matter how those nutes are delivered."
microgrowery,fefigo6,t3_eoumql,1579057000.0,"First of all, some seeds for whatever reason just do not have what it takes to make it above soil, and it's no fault of yours. 1-2 out of every ten wouldn't surprise me, really. (I pop some pretty old seeds sometimes.) I also like the paper towel method, it's the only thing that's ever worked for me.

Second, planting a small plant in a big pot can be tricky, so I prefer to go solo cup---> 1gal---> final pot, whatever size. It's like, in cups they're forced to make a dense, solid root system that makes for a nice transplant. In a big pot, you have to really encourage that kind of root system with crafty watering.

In any case, I like to soak the cups I'm going to plant them in the day before I plant so there are no secret dry spots, the moisture's really soaked in before I plant, and the medium has more or less settled in so the seed won't shift around so much when I water it in with a couple capfuls of water.

DO NOT OVER WATER. This is key to my success rate with seedlings. Let it dry out good a few times, til it's almost wilted. Don't soak that whole 7gal pot til the plants are big, just water a small circle around them and slowly expand it as they grow. I'd say the height and branch length are good indicators of the diameter of your watering circle, roughly.

Sorry for the novel, I am thoroughly baked, and I think about watering a lot."
microgrowery,fefecc0,t3_eountm,1579054513.0,"1. HSO Green Crack fem is super easy to grow, is a big producer, and most people are happy with the smoke which is a solid 50/50 hybrid high. There is a pheno in there that smells very strongly of hot garbage, it's awesome.
2. C99 from pretty much any breeder is fast, very easy to grow, is a strong yielder, and at its best has an extremely strong, speedy high.
3. MK-Ultra is one of my all time faves. It can take some hunting to get to the really good phenos, though. The good ones are spectacular smoke, good yielders, easy to grow.
4. Riserva Privada Skywalker Kush was a challenging plant, on account of its stretch, but pretty bombproof as far as stress resistance, so that'd be good for a beginner, too. Potent, fuelly OG with flavor for days.

That's a short list. They're all available as fem seed from many reputable US seedbanks.

I say avoid Cookies in all its forms and most diesels as well, as they can tend to throw hermie flowers even in a perfect round in a perfect environment...at least for your first round or two, til you get your feet wet.

And avoid anything that takes longer than ten weeks to flower on your first couple rounds, too! Make it easy for yourself, 9-10 weekers, max."
