IdiotsInCars,ffqfsow,t1_ffqbmcs,1580133315.0,"People keep saying things like this. “If someone beat on my door I’d shoot them.” Or “if some thief tried to grab my bag they’d be riding home in an ambulance.”

What people forget is that force should be commensurate with the crime. If someone bangs on your door you can close it on their hand or push them out the way. You can’t shoot them dead. Banging on a door is not a capital offence.  Stealing a bag is not an offence that should be punished by injury. It should be punished by the courts.

Please stop going all DEFCON 1 on things that upset you. Breaking a car windscreen deserves a fine, or community service - not attempted murder in response."

Yes parents should know this stuff- it’s all taught in first aid in this country. But we can’t be punishing you if you don’t know it, if you panic and forget it- especially as you have run into a police station where it is guaranteed 100% of the staff know what to do."

DogCare,fcag51o,t3_eg8xm0,1577568647.0,"I asked this question on a Great Dane FB page and everyone said- 1. no harness- they are dangerous once the dog is over 30kg. 2. Get a safety cargo net between the front and back of the car and she should travel in the rear boot section.  Aside from that or a crate there is no way to secure her. I don’t like crates in cars as I worry in the heat here in Oz they will get too hot. 

I also once left my lab in a hot car in the driveway ( he was fine- I remembered soon after) when he fell asleep and I forgot he was in the rear- so now I leave the car/house keys with the dog."
IdiotsInCars,fc542o3,t1_fc4h1sf,1577442086.0,So what should you do if you have had too much to drive- hide the keys and hope you remember where in the morning? Put the keys in a combination lock safe so the police don’t know they are there? I am genuinely confused as to what you are expected to do if there is no-one you can palm off the keys to.
