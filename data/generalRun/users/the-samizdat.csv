You said other developing nations don’t have bankruptcies due to medical bills. I am telling you it’s only true because it’s not a options. 

Not only is it not an option, the data is just not there. America’s bankruptcies are made public, this is not true for most developing countries. 

If you dig around, depending on who you want to believe, some where between 10%-30% of bankruptcies are due to illness in most developing countries. In the US it’s somewhere between 20%-60% of bankruptcies, again depending on who’s data you go by.

This article is about asylum seekers appearing for court. And the administration having a 99% success rate. This is near perfect. 

Believe what you want, I found a clear answer to what Trump was referring to when he said 2%. According to NBC:


“The Trump administration has compared the tens of thousands of asylum seekers still in the country this year to the far smaller number of those who have been removed to back up their claim that those who seek asylum are exploiting a backlogged system.”"

99% of asylum seekers appear in court in 2019. That’s pretty nice. Your article presents different stats but still show year over year improvement, 

Vox does quote trump from a rally over a year ago but it’s not clear what trump is talking about from the quote. Accordingly sources he’s referring to the catch and release program. When asked to clarify he dodged questions. But yet Vox says he was referring to Asylum seekers? Yet, when New York times asked for clarification the admin never answered. 

So here the facts of the article:

the data is clear, the rate has improved under this administration. That’s good.

Trump made some nonsense quote from a rally over a year ago. To this day, no one knows what he was talking about."
