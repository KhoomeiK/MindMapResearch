Psychiatry,ff8aqka,t1_ff89vay,1579671145.0,"Well, getting an MD/PhD is also a possibility, and would open the door to more research. Granted, there are many ways to get into biomedical research. What is your current educational background? If you're prepared to tackle physics, ochem, biochem, calculus etc in undergrad then med school could be a good fit...

You could pursue a clinical psych PhD at a program with more biomed leanings, and then do a post doc somewhere more medically oriented. You don't need to be everything, finding a good team/organization is part of the process. If clinical psychology sounds good to you, go to the American Psychological Association website and look through their different divisions."

Psychiatry,ff851br,t3_es6589,1579666181.0,"Certain states have psychopharmacology licenses for clinical psychologists but it requires extra training after PhD. It might be an extra Masters , idk. There are a number of states where this is possible ""Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, New Mexico, and Louisiana, as well as in the Public Health Service, the Indian Health Service, the U.S. military, and Guam"".

Although if you just want to prescribe, take a look at what psychiatric nurse practitioners do. I've worked with one who is top of her game. 

I've worked with one prescribing psychologist and heard about one other in my city, and I am unimpressed. If you just want to prescribe, stick to nursing or psychiatry. If you are interested in drug mechanism and its relationship to therapeutic processes, then going into psychopharmacology after a PhD is not a bad idea. 

If you are more interested in the biological mechanisms that the psychological mechanisms,  go to medical school or get a master's in a related field. If you want a clinical licensure that would be PhD, MD, or PsychNP."

addiction,fezljhd,t3_eqwtqj,1579458628.0,"Don't break your back to carry her burden, first off. Second, she needs to have a frank conversation with her prescriber about alternatives to Ritalin if she is at risk to abuse it.

Third, and most importantly she should seek therapy from a professional in drug treatment. It could be a therapist, social worker, or substance abuse counselor. It doesnt have to be rehab. 

Support her but don't control things. Drive her to appointments if she needs, sit in with her if she wants. Do what you can to help but don't tear yourself up. Seek therapy to deal with the stress that you are experiencing, and set a good example for her. 

Best of luck."

My husband does most of the cooking and I'm at school and work all week. I'm trying to get more motivated to meal prep on the weekends. Just bought a bunch of faux meat for easy dinners for the toddler but he isn't convinced yet. I'm feeling a lot more motivated to cut meat out, so we'll see how things go."

vegan,fewf80t,t1_fewe8pg,1579409596.0,I'm not a big fan of youtube...  I recognize the horrors of the meat and dairy industry and have for a long time. I was a vegetarian for 5 years but poverty/homelessness made it hard for me to continue. Still very poor with very little time to cook and a spouse who will likely never stop eating meat. I'm proud of you for taking control of your diet and your impact on the world but I need to be realistic for my situation. Ideally in the future I will be able to cut out all animal projects but it's not feasible for me in the now. Ty for the encouragement. ❤

Neuropsychology,fevty3y,t1_fevsawa,1579401463.0,"Yes, he needs a referral. If you are in the US it goes PCP--->neurologist--->neuropsych. But if you can, see if the PCP would consider making a referral to a neuropsych as their wait lists can be longer than neurology (not sure if this is possible). 

See if his family can write down what they sincerely recall, this could help diagnosis.  

In the mean time try to get with a bonafide CBT therapist that he actually likes in order to manage symptoms."
Neuropsychology,fevqazw,t3_eqq6jq,1579400207.0,"Yes. Push for a neuropsych assessment. Get one scheduled because wait times are long. Get imaging (neurology) done and bring it to the appointment.

Express your concern but know that he himself needs to want intervention. He has to be motivated. See if his parents remember details about his childhood injuries or have medical records.

Best of luck."

BipolarReddit,fdjald4,t3_eldhfz,1578463368.0,"Hi, my kiddo turns 3 in March. It has been hell, but I love him with all my heart. 

I had PP-OCD/anxiety symptoms out the wazoo, stopped being able to drive above 35 mph, and had many fights with my husband while I was pregnant. 

To be fair, I was in a horrible state when I got pregnant. Just out of two relationships and into marriage. Super mixed. Riding a wave of grief after my dad died, multiple sexual assaults, and resurfacing of horrible part of my childhood.  

Historicallly, my issues go beyond BP2. As of right now, I feel a lot better. I had been in weekly therapy for about a year and we are about to start couples counseling to work out some kinks (not that kind lol). I STRONGLY recommend having a good counselor before you have a kid, and for your partner as well.

I find that the more stressed I am about money, the worse of a parent I am. If I'm not sleeping or not eating, I get so frustrated so easily. When I'm happy, we paint and make cookies and go to the zoo. Manic mom is great and fun unless she's angry or depressed. Then we sit and watch all of Star Wars 20 times while I get upset that he is too distracted to eat and I feel like a bad parent. 

Being a parent in general is a balancing act. Doing it with what feels like (to me) a handicap,  if freaking difficult. Not impossible, but very straining. 

Now as to whether or not it is cruel. My dad had agoraphobia and severe substance use problems. He may have had BP. My mother has severe anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I don't blame either of them. What I had wanted was for them to be more open about their struggles.

These things can be heritable, your kid could be fine, they could make their own choices later in life that end up poorly. If they get a diagnosis, you could provide support and empathize in a way that most people don't get. You could ensure that they get the help they need from qualified individuals. 

Work on yourself. Set up a large support system. That child is not you, they are life itself. They are endless possibilities. They deserve love and the best that you can do. Often we don't do our best and that is ok, so long as we have their best interests at heart.  

Is it cruel? Maybe. Life is a big fucking risk. I wish you the best of luck."

psychotherapy,fcoho2z,t1_fcnfw54,1577832465.0,"I would say that is concerning. As a previous commenter pointed out, substance use is usually a coping mechanism. Unless the majority of your clients don't have a comorbid diagnosis, this is setting up major roadblocks in their recovery. Plus, it makes it difficult for you as their SUDs counselor to get a real gauge on how the rest of their mental health is fairing, as people in this situation aren't always upfront. Do you guys have case mgmt or do you refer out for that as well?"
EntitledBitch,fcavj9q,t1_fcav2vg,1577577446.0,Lol. There you go agaaaaaain.
EntitledBitch,fcavgkb,t1_fcauy9j,1577577403.0,"Lordy. Unless you have literal data to show that 99.999999% of people make significantly more than min.wage (ie a living wage) all the time (as in people are not at the poverty line for most of the time or on off seasons), then your argument doesn't hold much water. Simply because something is statistically insignificant doesn't mean that there isn't a human cost. That is what matters here. We can argue statistics all day, but the point I was making is that there a people who don't make enough and aren't ""sup-par"" as you would say."
EntitledBitch,fcau2z9,t1_fcat8rr,1577576629.0,"Nah, but your failure to make a coherent argument and your descent into to calling me stupid and ignorant frames you in an unfavorable light. Regardless, to sum up this unfortunate exchange: tip your servers, and don't be rude to people online."

EntitledBitch,fcao1zv,t1_fcamo8a,1577573100.0,"Wow, you're out of touch. Anyone making min. wage is significant. It's not a living wage (that is the point of this discussion). Most people in food service might make more than min. wage all the time, which is good, but you are saying that those making min. wage as servers are bad at their job and this is false. 

Ask anyone who has worked in a seasonal town: sometimes you make $30 an hour because you had an 3 8-tops that double tipped you, and sometimes your coworkers all get sent home and you have 2 tables that stiffed you over the course of 8 hours. 

Plus you have to tip out a percentage of your sales to bartenders, busses and sometimes even the kitchen ;) so keep it to yourself if you think you know just because you worked in a kitchen for a week on summer break. Ain't nobody got time for your saying ""we don't have it that bad"" because shit, we do."
EntitledBitch,fcalwi9,t1_fcal9bt,1577571837.0,"All of these are completely different scenarios.
