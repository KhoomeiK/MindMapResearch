quotes,ferwql0,t1_feoia8c,1579359104.0,"Yes, I agree and I see the point you're making. Ideally, the rejected child ought to pull himself up by his bootstraps and use the passion to go higher than the rest. I also subscribe to this belief.

Most people however, are weak. For some reason, most people just can't do that. They indulge in beliefs about chronic depression and self-imposed anxiety and choose to suffer rather than to sacrifice and reap the benefits of personal responsibility. 

Life is a dichotomy between those who can, and those who need constant fucking help with everything."
dbz,ferp22r,t3_epmmp5,1579356713.0,"Here is my take on it. I played it last night up until Goku reaches Snakeway. 

Graphically it is beautiful. The first time I flew around as Piccollo is when I was taken aback at the depth of the environment. It feels like real DBZ. The sound effects are there, the attacks and moves are there. The fights feel like how DBZ looks like. 

If you are into lore and expanding the universe, you will enjoy this. They added dialogue, explained some things a bit more. You can talk to villagers and hear their reactions to Raditz for example. Lots of Dragonball references. Story-wise it's great. 

My issues are pretty minuscule, really. Oftentimes, you can hear that the audio track for voice clips is doubled, and off by like half a second. You think you're hearing two Piccollos sometimes. This one time the screen went black and I was waiting for something to happen, not knowing i need to press A to continue lol. 

Random words are missing in the subtitles sometimes. And you can't change the controls if you're using a controller. Why they made R1 be fly up and R2 fly down is beyond me but it's not a big issue. 

Other than that, it's an awesome 3D retelling of DBZ and I'm looking forward to playing more."

GetMotivated,fehlmzb,t3_ep5u3s,1579119048.0,"I believe it was Neil DegrasseGetsYouHighSon who said that if you look up at the sky and feel small, you must have came in with a huge ego in the first place."
GetMotivated,fehle6s,t1_feh6fz9,1579118906.0,"This is my point exactly. People are so quick to say ""LOL!! Religion!!"". This is such a basic way of looking at it. When you really study religious beliefs, you realize how little it has to do with ""magic man in the sky"" and how much of it is sculpting your own success and staying in equilibrium with nature. 

The more I understand the concept of God, the less I think it has anything to do with anything supernatural, and the more I see that it has to do with one's own mental state and discipline."

acting,fdvz0oo,t1_fdvquhc,1578753284.0,"I was thinking about this yesterday. Look at Danny Devito. Hes basically a troll. Great actor. 

Now look at Hayden Christiansen. Good looking guy, but his acting in the star wars movies was very flat and dry. He certainly looks the part, though.

BUT consider this: he still got the part."

gallifrey,fczuw97,t3_ein741,1578109023.0,"I actually liked it. It felt like the characterization of the characters was way better than before, noticeably. The companions are a bit more likable. 

Now, the guy that played the Master at the end? Amazing. Brilliant. He did it so well, he got the right kinds of mannerisms that are perfect for the Master. Sinister, giddy at his own evil, and off his rocker crazy. The last few minutes definitely saved an otherwise rather tame episode. Looking forward to what else they've cooked up.

But you know what? I don't like how it seems like The Doctor sort of lets herself get pushed around a bit more than before. She should be more assertive. They're all great though."
GetMotivated,fcyxpjn,t3_ejh2q1,1578089379.0,"My mind is pretty clear on what makes someone beautiful and also what makes them ugly. In my experience, healthy habits and positive outlooks often lead to outer beauty, whereas toxic ways of thinking and bad lifestyle choices result in an ugly outward appearance. Nothing in life is standalone, it's all connected. 

In a way, the whole push for traditionally ugly people to not be seen in such a light is unnatural. It goes against not only human nature, but it undermines the positive transformative effects of healthy habits. 

Think about it, if you are fat, why should the world lie to your face and tell you that there is nothing wrong with your fatness? The whole body positivity movement is a destructive fallacy of thought. 

If you have huge acne, look at your diet. If you are lanky, look at your physical activities, or lack thereof. If you stink, smell yourself. Bad teeth? Fix them shits! It's a defeatist attitude to simply accept one's ugliness, and the people who make you aware of just how ugly you really are, are in reality your best friends. A regular friend will just let you be ugly all your life without telling you."
SonicTheHedgehog,fcy2lus,t3_eior9w,1578073973.0,You know... I kind of like Cream the Rabbit.... in an ironic sort of way... but playing as her character makes me feel like I'm playing some baby game lol. Plus her voice.
SonicTheHedgehog,fcy20an,t1_fcvwnar,1578073682.0,"Why is she immediately useless? Maybe she is flawed, imperfect. Raised to be squeaky clean her whole life, and suddently she meets someone who makes her live differently, it's understandable that she would rebel a little and want to save the one thing she liked in her life. Sonic understanding that there are bigger issues at hand was also a nice touch at the end."
