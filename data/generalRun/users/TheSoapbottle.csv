todayilearned,fdgcrbe,t1_fdgbia2,1578390470.0,"I absolutely see where you're coming from. I think by the time the Beatles rolled around rock really changed, taking influence from eastern cultures, taking advantage of more types of sounds and moving away from the blues.
But in terms of early rock, i think using the word steal does some good in reference to what happened. Many of the early rock artists who became popular didnt do much new. The music wasn't popular not because it was bad music, but because it was played by black people, and very much portraying them. They took classic blues songs and 'tidied"" them up for a white audience. Lots of the lust, debauchery, emotion and sin got lost from the older songs, and in a way they tended to bastardized them.
Music isnt just the lyrics, the underlaying chord progression, use of scales and general beat is really what defines different genres. In the case of rock, rock already existed, but not in the mainstream until white artists started taking over the songs."
todayilearned,fdgb39u,t1_fdgak8v,1578388040.0,"Look up hound dog original version, not word for word but the song existed before him.

Hell the story of elvis getting famous says alot. I'm paraphrasing but the story basically goes a music producer said one day ""If only I could get a white man who sings how the n***ers sing"" and then comes in Elvis who was just trying to record some songs for his mom.

Elvis grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, he was exposed to the blues from an early age and was really able to hone into the way black people were singing. 

Rock was born out of the blues and the black community. People were digging it but the artists still didn't have the peoples respect due to the color of their skin. A couple good blue artists i can name that ade pre elvis: Howlin wolf, muddy waters."

AskReddit,fdg9572,t3_ekyrlt,1578385359.0,"Alright to play devils advocate and go against the reddit hivemind (jesuschrist save me) and please -please- tell me why I'm wrong.

To stabilize a countries population, no. I dont have the numbers but I remember after WW1 and 2 russias male population was hit pretty hard, but it seemed to bounce back. Men can get many woman pregnant in a short time span, woman can only get themselves pregnant.

Is this good? All I know is economically more people tend to benefit a country. Factor in how many children are left fatherless and the effect of that, and the economic effect of having to support these families, I could see it outweighing it.

I dont exactly believe in this, just the first counter arguement that came to mind.

Now tell me why I'm a sexist bigot reddit!"
AskReddit,fdd6ycf,t1_fd98bvt,1578297535.0,"I fully agree with you. If you are living paycheck to paycheck it's near impossible to have enough money to travel. My point is more there are cheaper ways to travel than just the glorified instagrams you see from some people. I was in a lucky enough position where I was living at home with little expenses so that I was able to save up for a visa and a flight ticket. Now that I'm here all the money I make goes to food and rent.

However I hope to save up money doing farmwork (pearling) which seems doable according to other travellers, however I'm still in a privileged position that I have no obligations ,and a family to go back to when I go back home.

If you are young, and still have a family to support you, and few obligations I think travelling is extremely doable, however if you have obligations, it can be near impossible."
