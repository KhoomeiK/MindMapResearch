spirituality,ffdobje,t1_ffdj2e3,1579825138.0,"I'm not really ""on the mindset of reincarnation"". If you haven't read my other post here I think that maybe is even more complex than that. What if everything they say about death is actually right, you know, you could probably get to reincarnate but there's a possibility that you could just become one with the nothing, or maybe the dice will land on ""gets to become a roaming ghost"", or ""gets to become an angel with most of their consciousness intact"", or ""becomes a mindless energy being in another plane of existence"". 

I have... not really proof but close experiences, from different people in my family and my own. I was revived and got to experience the nothing. But it wasn't what happened to other people, it was different for them. A cousin that died in an accident became a ghost right after preserved his consciousness long enough to not notice he was dead and went back home the day he died, rang the door like desperate but my aunt saw no one, he was already dead. My grandfather became something else, he appeared before my mother as a shadow, she asked him to take my sick grandma quickly and without pain, he did two days later. The son of one of my uncles was someone reincarnated, when very young he would tell people stories of his previous life, factual things they later looked up, until he couldn't remember anymore.

I think souls are created or recicked within us, some to be harvested, others to grow like wild weed, others to transform themselves, maybe grow bigger or just get to other places. I don't know what determines what you're gonna get. Is definitely not karma or your good deeds in life. I don't know yet. 

I'm happy though. Even if I know now what awaits me it like it. Not that I'm going to remember anything but it does feel liberating to stop and become nothing. Who knows, maybe there will be something later. Nothing is forever. Not even Death."
spirituality,ffcopvl,t1_ff9yboo,1579803967.0,"You never disappear entirely. But you have to learn to appreciate what makes you *you*, to see your family, friends, your ancestors, your planet living in you. It's good to be selfish and have a defined self but don't forget that there's other things bigger than yourself and very small parts that as meaningless as they might appear all of them form you, that to see them you'll have to keep silence and forget yourself for a moment to look back at them and you'll see why they are important and beautiful in their own right, to appreciate and acknowledge them, because your next self will have to learn that too to appreciate you and what you did for the next you.

I believe that even if you forget yourself and everything in the end, you don't completely start from zero, parts of you stay and repeat themselves and keeps adding, small or big, you will continue and serve other purposes."
spirituality,ffc234i,t1_ffba0go,1579789596.0,"Heaven and hell real?
I don't think there's karmic retribution, therefore, there's no hell or heaven because everything is hell and heaven. Everything that is too good to be true isn't and everything that is too bad to believe isn't either. Even if there's no karma there IS balance, there is ups and downs to everything at any point but at the same time it counteracts it to become stable again, forever in a cycle. If your life seems unfair and ends badly then it was meant to balance out something much bigger than you and your circle, if a bad person gets their way and seems to not get retribution maybe is counteracting something else in a bigger circle. It's true that no one is there to answer the questions, we are all alone with it and what we have. In that sense we are the ones that should care because we are here and whoever isn't isn't. Responsibility weights a lot if that's the case, but if we want to keep on the theather of life we have to make the play with whatever we can find: props, costumes, imagination, mimicry, stories, to at least make it interesting in the middle of the very blunt and dry reality.

Is karma real? Predestined and pre written?
I don't think karma is real for the reasons before but I do believe our lives are prewritten. In the sense that everything follows an invisible line which could only have gone one way because even if you do something different it could have only he because you needed to or because it was a logical path that would happen at that moment. Even if you do nothing and let yourself rot it was already bound to happen. None the less the question is not if you are being controlled by an outside force or by a destiny, but if you would be willing to fight it regardless or accept it and follow it. Even if it's ""useless"" to try to change anything?

Does reincarnation exist? Would it matter?
Probably it's a thing that exist. But don't be so dramatic, the void is not scary and you won't even remember yourself, you won't even remember what is ""remember"", therefore you won't be scared of it, what is there to be scared for if you won't know what it is and at the same time it will be just as natural as anything you have ever known. People won't forget because there's nothing to forget in the first place. I would think there will be echoes of them in you if you know to listen to them. What are you but the amalgamation of everything that surrounds you, including people. And even if you don't continue to be you after death you won't even miss it."
spirituality,ffba0go,t3_esguvg,1579756814.0,"I'm not even going to pretend I know the answers, I'd just like to throw my opinions on your questions. 

Is this a prison planet?
It depends on how you see it. For example I find very curious that the Aztecs never really bothered with finding the borders of the earth or if the earth was flat or spherical. They thought if it as something eternally continuous either by land, sea or sky. There's just one place we live in and despite it seemingly having a limit to were you can walk to doesn't mean the world ends there. If you feel trapped is because of other reasons.

Are we born sinner who need Jesus to save us?
There's a lot of people, philosophers, that think that were all born as bad people, crazy even, mad. And I agree with them. Because you have to learn how to not be crazy and start to learn to become a person, an actual human. You born selfish, uncaring, unfeeling of others, manipulative, like a psychopath. You have to learn how to share, how the other one gets hurt by your actions, how to look beyond your personal benefit. If not then you'll continue to be crazy and less likely to change later, farther away from what that model of human we should work towards to and more animal or other things, even a monster. The Jesus part it just depends on your religion or lack of it. I'm not a believer so, yeah.

Are we alien hybrids who messed with our dna to create us?
I mean, everything on this planet is alien. There's a theory that life came to earth in an asteroid, probably from elsewhere in the Galaxy, probably from Mars itself when it was still living. I really doubt it's a Prometheus kind of thing though, that's only a movie. Although, of you want to dream, there's people that think that the classic depiction of the greys are some sort of a window to the look of future humans, like hyper evolved humans. 

Do aliens exist? And if so, are they inter dimensional beings, are they demons/spirits, or are they just flesh and blood beings?
Who could know. We as humans are so limited by our own senses and limits to our own knowledge and comprehension that there could be a ton of other things happening around is but we can't possibly know, like how some insects can see uv light, or dogs can sense presences we cannot even grasp with our human eyes and human sense in general. If you are referring to classic aliens then I would say there's some possibilities but none are that hopeful to ever see each other, though they do exist or will. I think there is life in other planets but life is so rare in the universe that they probably don't know of others than themselves too. Either that or we are actually the very first ones in the entire history of the universe, the very first signs of life.

Do we have a soul/spirit?
Who could know. I just know that my brain, my body and I are not the same even if we share the same being. We are really our brains because what else. But at the same time I'd like to imagine that the purpose of why the brain divides itself is to produce a soul. Just like how trees produce oxigen. Maybe there's a reason for us to have a personality beyond this plane of existence.

(To be edited)

Does consciousness live on after the brain dies?
Not sure. I would say no though. I know what's on the other side because I've died before, it was an accident combined with negligence, so I know what is like. It's true, there's nothing. You become one with nothing, so that means you become blank and completely wiped of everything: emotions, feelings, sensations, thinking, memories, just like when you sleep profoundly without dreams, is not even relaxing, is nothing. But, that doesn't mean it could end there. I feel like there should be something beyond nothing. But to get there you'll have to first experience nothing and stay there a while before getting to what's next, like any other night before day. Although I don't really know, it's only speculation and wishful thinking. I have thought some ""ghost"" stories that suggest that the could still be conscience after death. One cousin of mine died from a hit and run truck, but his ""spirit"" or whatever you want to call it didn't realized he was already dead, so he went back home that day and knock on the door to enter but when my aunt went out to open the door as usual, all mad because she thought he had forgotten the keys again, she saw no one there. I have more stories like that. So who's to say, maybe some keep their consciousness maybe some don't, maybe some become ghosts and some reincarnate or become unthinking matter. You'll know when you die.

Is the Big Bang the truth, or is creation?
I think it's pretty useless to ask this particular question. For the same reasons as before, we can only see up to a certain limit but more often than not when we finally pass that limit we only discover that it was not just it and that there's even more and more. And the more we look on it the more we find we were wrong. After some time, scientists stopped asking themselves what's the smallest thing on existence because it doesn't stop, they keep finding things. Was it by the hand of ""God""? If the answer is yes what does that change? If the answer is no it's also not that relevant since that would be it and also we cannot say for sure, only assume. What if we are wrong again because we cannot comprehend it yet, we haven't reached the limit yet if there's even one, what would we think if there's actually no beginning or end, of if there's no god after all, or if there is one that looks on us with everything that comes with having a creator. That would be too bold to assume. What if it was actually some kind of God but they have abandoned it's creation as soon as it was created and they have never looked back. What if it was no one really and we are just another cell in a huge body that doesn't even bother on knowing what it's cells think of it, or hasn't even realize there's an immensely tiny bubble so they render us as an unthinking thing, like we do with our own cells. There's too many possibilities but the thing is that whatever it is is not giving answers back, it just is or was and doesn't bother to explain, we only have what we know currently. So we can only guess on all other things and keep asking the right questions, the ones that are worth asking.

Why do so many ancient cultures claim to have made contact with gods? Real or all myths?
It depends on what culture you are asking. We cannot generalize. One thing for certain is that they all were at the same time more knowledgeable and connected to nature and earth and at the same time very ignorant and full of wrong superstitions and assumptions. I can talk about Aztecs because I've studied them and also I have the ancestry too, I know a thing or two. So, it's curious for example that they didn't actually believed in Gods as we think of them like being a person, or a superpowerfull being with sentience and a body and personality that was the origin of the thing they were in charge, like the god of water made water possible, or the god of the sun that gave life or things like that. They had more this thinking of the earth as something already living, and nature as something already existing, and just gave the already existing things a personality according to how they see them acting like. So their gods were basically just the thing they represented with another name. Tlaloc was water personified, everything that is water was Tlaloc and water can either be gentle and healing as well as unforgiving and cold. Therefore Tlaloc was both, because he was water and all water was Tlaloc, even the clouds and thunders, the steam and ice. Same with air though they separated it as winter wind and normal wind. Normal wind was Quetzalcoatl, winter wind was Tezcatlipoca. When cold fronts approached they knew it was Tezcatlipoca approaching. At the same time everything is connected in the universe, so Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca Being both wind were therefore twins, but it all parted and was explained in a way that the gods were not more important than the elements they represented. They were also ruled by nature and logic and their own metaphysical understanding, so if they discovered a new thing about it the god is the one that would change meaning, not the other way around. They were more like alchemical gods. So when they were in contact with them and made offers to them they were doing it to nature itself and to the rules of nature.

What’s the point of it all? So our souls can grow here and end up in another existence?
Probably as I meant before. It could be that, become other thing while keeping your consciousness, or not, or reincarnate, or become a monster, or cease to exist, or maybe any of that is a possibility depending on your luck. Maybe some have the chance to reincarnate while the other becomes an unresting ghost, but I highly doubt it depends on karmic justice or how good or bad you were in life. It depends on something else, though I don't know what."

Jokes aside. Death is scary. Not only because of how you will possibly die but because there's this unknown state of being after it if it even can be called that. But at the same time, how much is really worth worrying about it? It's the only given we have, it's the only very very sure thing that can and will happen. It can be expected or completely a surprise and then boom! You are no more. 

Knowing this thou, what are you going to do about it? You cannot defeat death, only slow it down. You cannot be totally prepared for it. So why even bother fighting it when it has declared itself. How can you feel sorry for what could have been if it never happened and there was certainly no guarantee of happening in the first place, because nothing is sure except for one thing. They certainly don't know it and will never, they don't even exist anymore to feel nothing, not even regret.

Feeling anxiety over an early death is just as useless. Anxiety won't prevent it from happening if it's your luck. 

How many times have you been close to dying? That you are aware of, of course. I can count at least 4 times myself that I remember from the top of my head, and I'm not even 30. Could I have prevented them? Not really. Why was I spared? By pure chance and luck. Would I have regretted my decisions if it had happened? No, even though in my present life I regret a lot of things, and condemn my misfortunes. Would I wanted to do more or change things over? Yes, but once I die there would be no hard feelings anymore. You do what you can with what is given to you. Nothing more. If your story is one of pain, even if you did it all over there wasn't really any other way it could have gone, and nothing can really change if nothing new is added, like you reading this from me for the first time. So the only thing you can really do is look for new things to see what you're missing out on. Of course you couldn't have known this beforehand so I'm telling it to you now even though this is no advise. Try something new. That way you will expand yourself more and have more stories to talk to Death on the way to the next new thing. And if you decide to not do so at least try to dream on what could have been."

For example, if I want to say ""I'm happy"" or ""estoy contento/contenta"" I would try to find another way to say the same thing like ""I'm feeling good"" or ""me siento bien"" or ""me siento alegre"". Or if I want to say ""I'm tired"" ""estoy cansado/cansada"" i would say ""I'm busted"" or ""Ya me cansé"", or any other synonymous phrase or word without gender context. Others can do the same to to talk in a similar manner to refer to you like for example ""ya te cansaste"" ""you're busted already"" instead of ""te ves cansado/cansada"" ""you look tired"" which implies already an affirmation of your condition but it's preferable than a reaffirmation of the gender. Or instead of ""Ella/él dijo que estaba contenta/contento"" you could say ""*name* dijo que se sentía alegre"".

There's of course some words that are simply impossible though, like hijo/hija, so ehg... At least I try. I will ask them to just be refered by my name or refer to the other by name. But until there's no actual neutral pronouns and way of speaking we can't really do anything. 

Some are trying to use ""e"" instead of ""a"" or ""o"" at the end since the few neutral words that exist end in ""e"" like ""caminante"" or ""presidente"" ""estudiante"", which, funnily enough, most people change it to ""a"" for women so the the neutral word is not neutral anymore if possible, so presidente would be divided as presidente for men and presidenta for women. I even remember when I was in elementary school that the anxiety over not offending women and make like this gender justice equality thing was precisely pouring down on the language that people started to include and make neutral words not neutral anymore. So I lived the disappearence of many ""e"" words, some of which have completely vanished from the memory of people. So this agender groups are trying to bring the ""e"" back as a way to have an actual neutral gender option but is not going great and to be honest it sounds a bit... weird for some words. I would like for it to become a thing though but it's going to need a lot of help and a long time for ppl to accept it."

It is a choice to suffer from it but that doesn't necessarily solved the main problem, which is the thing causing the pain in the first place.

SuicideWatch,fdkar3z,t3_elsjct,1578499905.0,"There's no psychological component to it. Haven't you heard? It's a psychiatric disorder, a chemical imbalance cured by the right combination of pills and self improvement books.

Just kidding. For starters: The reason why depression exists in a person is not the cause of the so called changes on the brain by itself. It's a thing people either don't understand or don't want to recognize, but depression it's a symptom of something else. Something causes depression and not the other way around. And that cause is so simple that you probably can relate and understand (of course, if you have the understanding to do so): it's reality. But is not just reality itself, is a BAD outcome of reality.  

So, genetics do have something to do with it a bot, and the same personality type of someone, but let me put it this way. You are walking on the street like normal and suddenly out of nowhere a guy punches you in the face and calls you stupid. You probably would be mad at them and think it's strange, but the next day the same guy appears and punches you again, not only that but a few hours later another person makes you trip on purpose. Strange things like this continue to happen at any time any place for a long time and escalating, like suddenly you loose your job because they are closing down, or your sunnyside eggs don't turn out well, whatever bad things happen. And after a while you start to get depressed because of this. Asking yourself ""what the fuck?"". And even if at one point things get back to normal you can either come out of it or not and start to expect the worse. It's not a reality anymore but it came from one. One that was not an illusion or an imbalance, it was real and it happened. And one in which pretty much any person would be sad about because who likes punches in the face? Or loosing money or stability. Not only physical and material but emotional, social, etc. Why did it happened? Who knows, maybe the dice was not in your favor for God knows how long, maybe the guy just followed you and told all their friends to make your life miserable, maybe it was the alignment of the planets, who knows but it doesn't take out the fact that it definitely happened. Did you choose that? No. Could you choose to be happy regardless of what was happening? Could you do it? Of course not, otherwise I would think you are actually insane for being happy about it, or comfortable to be in a situation like that waiting for it to get better someday.

I agree that there's *some* things in the chemistry of the body that can devolve into depression like lack of sun or poor diet, but there's as many types of depression as types of headaches and I don't think it's fair to put them all together and call them the same, ""caused by the same"", "" treated like they are the same"", one pill for everything, one cause for all of them. Just imagine what would happen if a doctor just gives a look at your laboratory results for a headache and starts to give you treatment for every possible cause changing medicine until something hits if it ever does without asking your medical history or habits. That would be insane.

Suicide then, is when this reality, either present or past, is unbearable, and it has to stop because it doesn't only makes you sad but because it actually hurts, the brain is not sick or wrong for feeling it like you actually got physically hurt and are currently bleeding somehow, that's how it naturally works and is not incorrect because it's a natural reaction everyone experiences, you just don't realize because normally it doesn't get to those extremes, it's what happens. You either are in a situation or learned from a situation that changed you and your view on things. You went through something that others won't have any clue what is like, just guess and try to empathize. And depending on your own nature, you will overcome it or not taking into account the impact and your ability to withstand it. Like a victim of a car crash. Some will get healthy sooner, others may have sequels that will never recover, or recover in the wrong way, like a badly fused fracture. And it takes time and therapy aside from medicine. It's the same here. You just can't see it directly.

If a person is dying, they can choose to go through assisted dead. It's a recognized way to end the suffering of someone without pain. Suicide presents itself as a solution to your ""internal bleeding"" (and if you don't believe me that the brain reacts like you have been physically hurt when you are mentally scared then do your research). You feel dying but no one helps you and it's not healing. You try your pills but nothing happens, they just make you numb because that's what they do and that's why many are used to treat insomnia too. You don't want to be in a situation like that. You don't want to be ""in bed with a burnt body unable to live without assistance"" metaphorically speaking. And you can't do it legally because it's very taboo. It's like the situation is also that bad and without escape. And you will continue to suffer without anything that can help you because the solutions might be obvious to others but in your reality you don't have the tools to see them, or the opportunity to even think about them. So they actually don't exist. And if someone tells you that there's no solution, it's true until you come and give it to me as an actual solution that's going to change things, and you will have to teach me how because I don't know what you do it have the experiences that made you string against this situations that you have already forgotten or even never encountered yourself in your lifetime. Like the cave allegory.

death,fcql1mp,t3_eif8lr,1577887884.0,"Not gonna lie to you, it all depends on how you die.

Sometimes, like in accidents, you may not even realize that you are already dead. If you are unfortunate enough to catch a terrible decease it could hurt, a lot, for as long as it takes you to finally die, so it can even take months. I've seen relatively peaceful deaths were the person accepts their faith and when they don't try to fight it so they just slip away and almost just fall asleep; others fight to the last second and feel all of the process. 

In my own experience, I've fainted and stopped breathing, I was seconds away for it to be a permanent death, so it might as well count as death. My blood circulation was being cut by a rubber band to the head and heavy exercise (I was like 10 and some of my teachers were really stupid and I too ignorant). I of course had a headache but also my stomach started to hurt, got dizzy, kinda like in a hangover, I went to the teacher to tell her how I was feeling weird and instantly I started to hear like white noise in my ears, stronger and stronger and all other sounds went numb while a ""vignette"" of black appeared in my vision and was closing fast and amorphous to the center. I didn't felt any other pain than my headache and stomach so when the other things happened I was just so confused and weirded out, like ""woah... What is this?"". When everything was black I stopped hearing. Then nothing, just black and no sensations of any kind or thoughts of any kind. I lost consciousness and only regained it when they revived me and it felt kinda like waking up after sleeping a lot but then you realize that you slept on not the best conditions and start to feel the consequences. They told me that once I lost consciousness I fell to the ground but I didn't realized or felt any of that, I was already in another realm.
