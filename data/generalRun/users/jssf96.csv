The hotel will do their regular clean up and it usually gets rid of whatever smell there may be. The fine is really there to dissuade you from smoking in the room.

AskReddit,fekozwp,t1_fekojv2,1579204614.0,This what made me ask the question. Why does reddit reccomend communities. Most of the subreddits are owned by mods who if you do the slightest thing wrong or have a different opinion they will ban you. I get some trolls ruin things but they are some genuine reddit's that I follow and disagree with a lot of what they post but its entertaining so I just never post there. It's like a high school lunchroom
