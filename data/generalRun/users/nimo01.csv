I wasnt speaking directly at you and only you at all, as the inbox filled with the same comments.  I even read what I said and just saw how easily itd be to interpret that as how *truly* impactful they were, not just portrayed after.

BlackPeopleTwitter,ffofn7k,t1_ffocvjt,1580077200.0,"I have to say it again, I agree 100%...

We, I assume I speak for both, are not arguing the death of a parent at 15 is less traumatic than a star athlete.  The two just arent comparable.

When my grandpa died I was sad in an almost selfish way, trying to find a reason to be more upset than I was (sad but not like aunts and uncles), crying only bc my dad did....

This is not something I will cry over, and I speak alone without judging, but its a tragedy that millions and millions of other people have been stripped away by someone who did more at 41 than all of us by 80."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffoesad,t1_ffodhih,1580076905.0,"Agreed I hope you see my initial reply. I wasnt comparing the impact, as much as I was kinda pre mad at the media if this is just another basketball player death...  he did more than entire teams can do, and was only 41...  sorry for the miscommunication."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffoec0t,t1_ffobubq,1580076744.0,"Right I know what you mean, as someone who used to say the same thing he did...  shamefully.  Its not like were comparing the person to parents or friends, but it hits a chord for so many people for a reason.  Its not an immobile sadness but its a tragedy and shocking to any fan of sportsmanship and the impact one person has.  Shoes....  

They will disagree til the death unless they understand the difference in impact."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffoareh,t1_ffo9dtl,1580075801.0,"I agree I just wonder what the press says.  Spent a long time being careful with my words, but want to just say:

I apologize if that came across as the severity of the deaths were compared.  Thats not my place either way and Im not about to compare one now either.  I only meant media reaction.  I hope you accept my apology.  

The two are irrelevant and it was an unneeded comment on a current event. This tragedy has no place being compared to the impact of another person, but news coverage makes ignorant people (not being mean to them, a lot of people dont know about his impact and a lot do). They are subconsciously rating the importance by how long they report, and decisions to continually talk about what he did well: a lot.

I smoked a bit, sorry for the length and using your comment, was talking generally"

Let other people do dumb shit for a couple decades until we trust it and it’s value represents the convenience after purchase, but right now sure free warranty but I’d be pissed going monthly bc something broke again...  but again sooner or later some people were going to be the test subjects lol

Totally agree no one should be trusting a car to do things when it’s not equipped for every possible scenario of unpredictable drivers or road conditions, etc.

Lots to work out, and wouldn’t look at one for awhile given my situation, but I’m fine with other people seeing if it works or not and spending their money"
SelfDrivingCarsLie,fe625jd,t1_fe612b1,1578880092.0,"White lie by skipping around the ownership question... My friend/ex coworker worked at one for years and left bc of the ridiculous hiring and firing/title changes.  He picked me up in a model S one year ago...

It didn’t feel like 80mph but it was unreal, once at the speed it felt like going 40, and I can completely see how one feels in more control with less sound and movement from the gear changing.  I do agree it can make someone more likely to be dumb, by trusting it.

And people want to prove or do things to show it has the power and ability. Maybe I would, just like I might get on my bike and go 140 through traffic.  But that’s me being an idiot.

I get your point, I just know a lot of the accidents are driver caused, and I’d rather them have a tesla and fuck up than a rwd corvette, doing a burn out only to catch the pavement and send them into the woods."
SelfDrivingCarsLie,fe60ggc,t1_fe5zxiu,1578879022.0,"No but plenty of clients who have them, many fanboys/girls who likely wouldn’t tell me problems if there were, and plenty of others that will be honest about the problems.

I just don’t see how this relates to Tesla if someone was dumb enough to floss while driving at nearly 90mph.  It’s the driver who is an idiot not the cars...  

The stock has made me a lot of money, and the hatred and media that comes along with it only puts more money in my pocket.

I just want to ask if you truly think it’s not the drivers fault...  you’re told to pay attention and not to speed.  That’s what caused the wreck.  Period.  

I’ll even agree that I’d never own one. Ever...  but we’re taking responsibility of the dumbass here, and how it’s highly unlikely they were perfect drivers before they owned one (given the story...)..."

It is harder for certain people but you can’t sit there and say “eh what’s one more drink?  I have a disease it’s not my fault”. No, you have a disease and you need to treat it.  There is no cure, and rarely a terminal one unless you’ve ruined your body for decades. Whatever the cause, it’s time to take ownership and help yourself get help..."
