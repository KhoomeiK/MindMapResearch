Fitness,fekvy4x,t1_fekv0r2,1579208718.0,"really depends on your goals! when i'm cutting down/losing weight, i'll usually eat a container or two of greek yogurt (80 kcal each, good amount of protein) for breakfast and either cubed or shredded chicken mixed with veggies (the generic ""corn, peas, carrots"" mix you can get at the grocery store frozen section). when i'm bulking, breakfasts are usually high protein leftovers (this morning was some extra ground venison from last night, a quest bar, and a thing of greek yogurt) and lunches are a mix of protein and a carb (chicken breast and pasta, roasted potatoes and steak, fajita chicken thighs and rice/beans and some tortillas, etc).

I generally agree with him, if you think you've put on too much fat, then just cut. Mini cuts and mini bulks can easily result in just spinning your wheels."
Fitness,fcnhpsu,t1_fcng170,1577811945.0,"Yeah, if you've dieted down from a high weight, it's hard mentally to really start to put on muscle because you can get discouraged by fat gain, especially with how you look in the mirror at the end of the day when you've eaten a million calories and look bloated as hell. 

If you really don't feel great about the belly fat, I'd recommend a cut just to trim it off while you can still make beginner gains on a deficit so that you can bulk in the near future. Like I said, it wouldn't be especially long or hard, and it would be more productive to cut down so you feel comfortable bulking rather than maintaining and recomping for a bit and not feeling comfortable bulking for much longer."
