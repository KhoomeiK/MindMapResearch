apexlegends,ffojnac,t1_ffnm5cd,1580078379.0,There are dozens of them! Dozens!
apexlegends,ffoji58,t1_ffnrq0c,1580078338.0,Maybe if it wasn’t instant. Because to use that in the middle of a losing firefight seems OP. But maybe it could take the same time as a Phoenix Kit (without lifeline’s heal speed bonus).

PS cigs will get that head rush but taste like shit."
trees,ffh02ui,t3_etkhcr,1579919513.0,"Spliffs have this brain expanding effect for me when I first puff onto one. I like that nicotine rush that first hits before the high settles. Taste wise though, pure joints will win every time."

todayilearned,fffsvkc,t1_fffltfa,1579891070.0,But is it literally a man versus horse competition? Maybe it’s like jockeys versus joggers.
DeathStranding,fffqpum,t1_ffeteuv,1579889736.0,He’s talking about Adam Driver acting as a grate in “no country for old men 2: a grate day 2 die”
aww,ffejvp1,t1_ffe9eih,1579851044.0,Idk if tierzoo on YouTube has mentioned koalas before but I’d say they are entirely too heavily spec’d into the digestion ability tree. Their survival tactics are way too niche for the current meta.
TheAdventureZone,ffejla0,t1_ffee2yi,1579850686.0,I just looks shadow placement by the artist to me.

LifeProTips,ff4kz14,t1_ff4h08l,1579566139.0,"If you’re making eye contact with a driver through the windshield, it’s likely your bike is heading directly into the front of that car. People will subconsciously aim their bike wherever they are focusing their eyes."
OverwatchUniversity,ff4irts,t3_ere8cz,1579564608.0,"I only started playing Support (almost exclusively  Moira) *AFTER* 2/2/2 became a thing. I almost immediately shot up to diamond, which is now my highest rated role. Im not trying to make you feel bad because I played as Tank almost exclusively before and now I’m still a gold/Plat Tank in 2/2/2.

I just basically got decently good at Moira because I would tell myself,

“DONT BE A DPS MOIRA!” 

 Since that is what would piss me off as a Tank playing with a Moira support."
books,ff40zqu,t3_ercxjc,1579553184.0,"IIRC The voyage of the Dawn trauder is fun since it’s written almost like a series of myths like the odyssey and the Iliad. The final book is really cool and dark because it entails the end of the known world as the characters know it. 

The remaining books inbetween ARE rather infantile in writing but the characters are literally kids living in a fantasy world but the book are very endearing. I read them all when I was younger but reading them now...Harry Potter is a better example of a kids series that gradually gets more serious in tone."
