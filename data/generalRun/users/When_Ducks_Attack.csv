todayilearned,ffermxh,t1_ffedce6,1579862148.0,">  normal ships couldn't sail without going to port for a year. 

The US Navy's supercarriers probably could.  They'd need regular underway resupply from the appropriate supply vessels, but it probably could spend a year at sea if it absolutely had to.

The result would not be a pretty one, I'm sure.  Not even considering the maintenance nightmares that would result from a cruise of that length, the crew morale would likely be somewhere south of the bilge by the time it was over.

Oddly, I'd expect the air wing to come through in better shape, if only because they could be cycled off and replaced with a new one.

It'd have to be an ugly, ugly situation for all of this to occur, but at least in theory it could be done."
