alexa,fg0mjk3,t3_ew902j,1580410791.0,"Do you have any routines that run daily before it?

Maybe see if you have a routine that has a wait in it.


For example if the tv turns on at 5pm and you have a routine that runs at 1pm, perhaps there is a “wait 4 hours” in there.     


I recommend you disable routines one or two at a time until it stops!

I had a similar issue and the routine actually didn’t say anything about turning on fire tv on, but I traced it, deleted it and re set it up and it’s been fine since."

DobermanPinscher,fg0lj02,t3_ew7xtp,1580410215.0,"I wouldn’t recommend either for apartment living.
There are gender differences, bitches tend to be more... well... bitchy.   I find males tend to be more silly/goofy.    You’re also more likely to have same sex aggression with females.    

You can get by with one in apartment permitting you have a lot of time to commit to them for exercise, training and off leash walks.   

You will need to take either gender for 2 long walks every day.   If you work, that means one will need to be before you go to work otherwise you can expect to come home to your house destroyed.   

I live in a decent sized house with a fully fenced yard and my dog gets two off leash walks a day including some chuck it in the field. I still think he would do better in a bigger house where we can play fetch indoors with a bigger area for him to run across because even at 10.5 years old with two long walks, he constantly wants toys thrown.   

This is not a couch potato breed and no gender is going to change that."

I didn’t say “it’s too complicated to explain” - I said I’m doing the best I can to explain it in a few sentences and further information is readily available to those who need it.
I also never said “just trust me” 

I completely stand by what I said, that person has no idea what they are taking about. Comparing HIV immunity in a small number of people to a potential pandemic from a mutated flu virus and saying people would survive because they would magically be immune to a new mutated virus? Clearly no clue what they are talking about 

I think I have a pretty good understanding of the risks, you are welcome to disagree based on my explanation here. Like I said, maybe I’m not doing the greatest job explaining it.  

And again, for like the 3rd time.... maybe it won’t exterminate 100% of people, but you’re grasping onto the straw and ignoring the point entirely.   If it kills 2% of the world, is it something we don’t care about? What about 25%? Is there an acceptable number? 

Are you basing your whole argument here on the fact that I used a tongue in cheek phrase “wipe out the planet”?  Sorry, let me rephrase - it could wipe out half the planet, maybe more. 

If there’s no way to predict exactly how many people it would kill, should we just let people carry on doing things that endanger the lives of millions of people?  These meat markets in China have been the source of countless outbreaks.  

We’ve already had a number of these viruses in the last 10 years ... swine flu killed what, half a million or so? 

There will be another flu pandemic, and another and another.  There are predictions that the next one will be the worse one yet.  

I’ll leave these here for you to read since this conversation has become redundant and you’re clearly a know it all on the subject.  Maybe you can contact all the subject matter experts cited here and let them know how clueless they are. I mean, some guy on reddit says it’s not possible so someone should probably let them know so they stop wasting resources on such a silly concept.

worldnews,ff6wq9h,t1_ff6n6vk,1579636459.0,"Let’s clarify a few things, first of all - your article does not say anyone is genetically immune.

Second of all, I never said that what I was explaining was “simple”.   It’s actually incredibly complicated, so much so that scientists can’t predict it or even plan for it.   I’m trying to simplify it as much as I can to get across in a few sentences on Reddit.   

I also realize that no virus has come that close before, but that doesn’t mean it won’t in the future and there are a whole slew of factors contributing to why at some point in the future it likely will.  

Beyond that, many of these viruses already exist in one form or another in animal hosts.   In their animal hosts they may cause no symptoms at all, so a mutation that kills off humans is perfectly feasibly because humans may not be the only host.  

And sure, maybe the next pandemic won’t kill every single human.... but that’s pretty pedantic, is there an acceptable percentage that somehow nullifies my point? If 50% of the world dies then it’s cool? 

Again, to reiterate - I didn’t come up with this stuff. Maybe I’m doing a poor job explaining myself or maybe you don’t believe me and that’s your business - if you want to know more, research it yourself and maybe you can explain it better than I can or maybe you’ll decide it’s a conspiracy theory.

worldnews,ff6infh,t1_ff6gw1x,1579628013.0,"They aren’t. I’m replying to you who stated that they would be.   

We aren’t even immune the regular flu that exists today.  It just isn’t deadly for most people.   

What’s to say that the mutated virus from other species that emerges in the future isn’t fatal to humans? 

We’re just assuming that a virus that originates from another species that traditionally isn’t compatible with humans but by fluke becomes viable in the human body is also always by coincidence going to be susceptible to our immune system as well?

In order to build immunity, you need to be able to get it and then your body needs to be able to respond appropriately and fight it off. 

If your body is not able to fight it off because it is resistant or simply because your body doesn’t even recognize it or worse, recognizes it but responds incorrectly by attacking your own cells then everyone who gets it dies.    

If this happens, the only option is containment. Which we have learned from previous experience rarely happens early enough and once it’s out it’s next to impossible to reel it back in.  

These aren’t my ideas or concepts, this is a genuine topic of concern amongst scientists, biologists and immunologists."

worldnews,ff6ezgo,t1_ff6c3zy,1579625747.0,"I don’t think you understand what you’re talking about.  Some humans are immune to HIV due to a gene mutation (though not in their T cells). True. But there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that humans have natural immunities to new viruses from other species. We don’t even have a natural immunity to the human version of the flu. A single mutation in a flu virus makes it possible for it to evade people’s immunity and even the flu vaccine.  There is also no cure for the flu. That’s why the flu shot changes every year and sometimes it doesn’t work. It is constantly mutating... but just a tiny bit.  
I’m not sure why you are assuming that if a flu bug carried by say - squirrels and turtles mutate together and suddenly become able to bind to humans that anyone would have a natural
immunity to it when we don’t even have a natural immunity to the human version of the (thankfully) less deadly flu that we’ve been studying for hundreds of years. 

But hey, I’m open to being proven wrong - so go ahead and link your sources on how there are super meta humans walking around who are immune to everything including viruses that don’t even exist today.


There are tons of viruses that we are immune to, yes. But that does not mean that there is a human walking around that is immune to all of them. Especially new, mutated ones.    Heck, we can’t even getting AROs under control."
worldnews,ff6aa9g,t1_ff6544d,1579622784.0,"No, not really. That’s how these crazy flu strains start.   Ones we have no cures or vaccines for.  Ones we can’t predict or even plan for. Then the race begins. Can we cure it before it decimates the population? So far we have been lucky. And I do mean LUCKY. It’s only a matter of time before a hybrid virus that normally can’t bind to humans mutates and spreads faster than we manage to cure it.  Or worse, we get a lizard flu or something that has an intubation period so long that we unknowingly spread it beyond a point of control.   It’s interesting and terrifying but there’s a decent chance that a flu pandemic will cause the next extinction or decimate the population beyond anything you can imagine. And it can happen with tomorrow. Fun stuff!"

DobermanPinscher,ff4jz4g,t1_ff4img1,1579565444.0,"He was on an antibiotic for a bladder infection for almost a month, we gave it to him with his evening meal as prescribed. However since he was on a raw diet, the food would be totally digested by early morning and the pill wouldn’t and it would cause him to vomit at the crack of dawn every day.  

Thankfully it took us so long to figure out what was happening that we had just a few days left of the antibiotics so we would give him a small scoop of dry dog food right before bed and sure enough that stopped the vomiting. Once the antibiotics were done, we discontinued the midnight snack and he has never done it since.   

It was a super scary experience because he was 7 at the time and he is an altobello male so I was terrified that he was going into heart failure (vomiting is a symptom of late stage). Vet listened to his heart with a stethoscope and said he had sinus rhythm (good) but after failing to figure out what was happening for another week we were sent a cardiologist for an echo. It was super stressful and I was so terrified I was going to lose him... until I went to buy some more of his favorite food, told the folks what was happening and they asked me what meds he had been put on..... somehow all 3 vets failed to make this connection."
DobermanPinscher,ff4icus,t1_ff4ffvd,1579564324.0,"Again, I’m not a vet but I disagree with what you were told.
A balanced raw diet is better than any processed food you can buy, permitting you’re feeding a good mix - which absolutely includes bones.  
Unless she has some type of digestive tract damage from the bone she swallowed, I wouldn’t let that incident impact your feeding choices in any way.  The same would have happened had she been eating bagged dog food. Any introduction of a new food can cause diarrhea so if that was the only thing that happened from her eating it, you can keep feeding raw as that one time bone eating isn’t going to impact her in the future if she is already recovered.  

If you’re unsure about giving her the proper mix you can google BARF diet as a good resource or buy pre packaged frozen raw food that has been expertly formulated.    Dog food is junk, even the best quality food can not compare to a good raw diet. 


As far as spaying, I’m not an expert - however from what I know, I agree with your breeder. My rule is never before 1.5 years, which is about the same as two heats give or take.  I know that’s not what you wanted to hear, since it is quite a bit more than you were hoping for and even what your vet said but due to their size and extremely rapid growth dobermans need the hormones they produce to close their growth plates properly.   It’s less about size and more about joint and ligament issues.   

On the plus side, it’s pretty easy to deal with a dog in heat and it only happens twice a year. Just get some old panties (even better since you have kids, she’ll likely wear the same size as them) and  put a panty liner in it and just cut a hole for her tail.   If your kids are too young to understand what’s happening you can just tell them its her “doggy diaper”.  

Just think of it this way, it may seem daunting to deal with a dog in heat for a couple weeks - but dealing with a dog that has ACL or CCL repair surgery is MUCH harder and much more expensive and if your dog develops hip dysplasia later in life... will you be able to live with knowing that you could have prevented it simply by dealing with a puppy period for an extra 2 weeks? 

I always tell people, if you don’t feel that the advise your vet is giving you is correct or in line with your own research, find another vet.  Same as you would if you felt your doctor was steering you wrong.   It took me a while but I found a vet who absolutely loves dobermans and he is my saving grace because he is knowledgeable about the breed and always learning more.   I actually love going in to see him because whenever we come in he always likes to chit chat about some new thing he read or learned about dobermans!


Also, I replied before clicking the pic - Bonnie is precious!!! We’re on a waitlist for a new puppy and you guys are giving me some serious puppy fever! She’s got really nice coloring!"
DobermanPinscher,ff3vyr2,t1_ff3p8c2,1579550044.0,"It may shock you, but vets are often trained in very general animal medicine and may not know the specific conditions that certain breeds are commonly prone to or be able to identify something they have never seen.  

Years ago, I took my dobe to three different vets and tried a number of different medications because he was vomiting every morning.  Spent thousands on tests. No one could tell me why.    You know who was able to diagnose the issue and solve his problems? The people who we bought his raw food from, who were a home maker and an accountant by trade. 

At the end of the day, a vet (just like a doctor) is only making an educated guess . Except unlike in human medicine, there are significantly fewer diagnostic tests available and even fewer of those available in individual vet offices.  

I am also making an educated guess and while my education may not be from a school of veterinary medicine - it is based off extensive knowledge of the breed and having seen this condition many times before, which is something OPs vet may not be able to say.  Furthermore, I have no horse in this race.   While I’d like to say that vets are all wonderful people, it wouldn’t be the first time that any medical professional has provided biased advice based on what benefits them the most.   

I would be extremely shocked if this vet was able to confirm this “genetic issue” he diagnosed with an identified gene mutation.   I work in medical genetics myself and access to this type of testing is slow even for humans and the costs are extremely high.  

I’m glad you have such faith in your vet, but I know for certain that humans make mistakes and even the best human doctors misdiagnose. If you’d let someone slice up your 12 week old puppy who is exhibiting symptoms that are synonymous with an easily fixable condition that Doberman puppies are prone to, thats your problem.   The fact that this vet didn’t even know that Purina large breed was the wrong food for this dog is enough of a red flag for me on its own.
