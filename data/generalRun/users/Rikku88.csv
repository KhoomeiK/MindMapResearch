coys,ffa6fc1,t3_esihmd,1579728789.0,"I'm so sad for Winks - first game in forever he looks quite good and then the guy who should have been red carded takes him out on what looks to be a painful injury. Ugh. 

Also Eriksen, ugh.  Is he trying to get Inter to reconsider taking him or something by being complete garbage? I try to see good in him when he comes on (hard task to manage) but today was unreal how bad he was. Scolding Sess and his pure laziness, it's terrible."
coys,ffa5asy,t1_ffa4yc5,1579728166.0,"On TV it sounds so quiet during Spurs matches at the new stadium, I feel like even at Wembley it seemed louder. Maybe it's just the recording for US TV, but in contrast, like Liverpool's matches the fans seem really loud."
coys,ff9uuf0,t1_ff9trqc,1579721925.0,Good to know if I see something from them in the future!
coys,ff9ur9u,t1_ff9udwe,1579721854.0,"I like the black GK top too! I'm not a huge fan of the Nike GK design this year, though I like the teal color, just not the pattern, but looks pretty good in black!"
coys,ff9tnlz,t3_esgq8x,1579721020.0,"I am not sure how valid this is - our local Spurs supporters group posted it on our group in Facebook earlier today. I personally like the pink and navy blue, it's one of my favorite color combos! Your thoughts?"
indianapolis,fen41dp,t1_fen3cmf,1579276493.0,"I agree. It is practically common knowledge now that dog fighters will use free pets as bait animals, likely other terrible people will do terrible things to animals with no stipulation for adoption. This should not be allowed."

unpopularopinion,fdql2wv,t1_fdqko1l,1578669253.0,"Lol, no one really. The deepest relationships I have are with my sibling and their spouse, my brother in law, (who is like a brother to me). They are the only people I feel comfortable talking about my problems with with no judgment, yikes, I know. I have had experience before with people (my mom) using things I confided as ammunition in arguments against me growing up so it’s something I’ve never really grown out of. I’m trying to open up more, to your point, I need to be able to do this with my SO about more than just his weight but building a life together - I will try harder!"
unpopularopinion,fdqj554,t1_fdpqgdp,1578667946.0,"Thanks, some how it made me feel better just to type it up and throw it out there. I have not talked to anyone about this and seeing it laid out in words plus your noticing the taking care of himself side, maybe gives me a little more push to ask him about it. I think it’s more of a personal thing with me, I am always super guarded and just it’s hard to be secure enough to talk about this kind of personal thing."
unpopularopinion,fdplv2h,t3_em9g4q,1578632276.0,"I agree, it’s just hard if the person you are dating maybe was always a little bit big to begin with and I wish I had the courage to do it. 

For me, I’ve never brought up his weight since we’ve been together. A few times he has brought up how in shape he “used to be,” okay, I don’t care, you never have been in our whole relationship but I still like you, and it forces me to have to awkwardly laugh or something. But now it’s getting to the point I can tell some positions when we have sex don’t feel right do to his weight gain, and it is causing me issues with even wanting sex because I know things don’t feel the same and I feel like I have to do all the work during! I don’t mind putting in effort into good sexy times, but it should not just be me every time! 

Several times over the last year he has called himself out on it, and yet NEVER does anything. Also, he travels a lot for work and always is out having large dinners and beers with coworkers. I travel for work too, but make sure to hit the gym 4-5x a week and watch what I eat for the rest of the week if I have a big night out with customers or coworkers (and am in very good physical shape - I lift, do cycle classes, and run). He had a physical recently at our corporate office and because they said he looks healthy based on all the biometrics except his obese BMI he’s not even trying, he even seemed to almost brag to me after it about how healthy he apparently is (I am glad he is healthy - before someone jumps in here). Most recently still he has been pulling some shit about some shops we go to how their QC must be bad because their XLs don’t fit the same, or how Puma brand shirts runs small or something....ugh. 

Sorry for the personal rant, I just feel lost and stuck on what to do. 

I wish I felt like I could call him out on his weight gain but because I have never done it in over 3 years I just feel uncomfortable. Even if I do it nicely, I am not sure how he will respond. It’s even worse because my last serious relationship the guy got comfortable and gained a ton of weight and was super lazy and I couldn’t take it anymore and it lead to our breakup. My boyfriend currently is different as he has a high work ethic in his career and cares about his appearance (nice clothes, shoes, hair, soaps/cologne, etc) so I just don’t see how he can’t see this or not have a work ethic in this aspect of his life."

coys,fdp0epg,t1_fdoyp91,1578617036.0,They also quoted the sun in that as well. Not saying it’s not going to happen but it all points back to the sun.
fatlogic,fdmeddx,t1_fdkxey0,1578547156.0,"I ran my first marathon in good shape about two months before my 30th birthday. I got tired, was sore throughout some of the day of the marathon, but was able to hike up large sand dunes up in northern Michigan the next day with 0 pain. I trained my endurance up for about 5 months. Sorry you had such a bad experience with your marathon! 

During the marathons I have done, I did not notice anyone I would consider obese just by my visual guess. There were definitely some people somewhat overweight though. During my half marathons though (and especially 5ks), it’s a lot more of a mixed bag - I see more overweight people at those. I give a lot of props to people who are overweight/obese and decided to use a race to start exercise and a healthy path in life (there were a few people like this in a half marathon training program I did back a few years back) but I agree, this would be pretty strenuous on the joints and maybe other forms of exercise are more suitable to work up to running (elliptical, cycling, swimming...)."
fatlogic,fdedf63,t1_fdebarw,1578336597.0,"Ugh, I am glad you understand my venting. 

I get so sick of seeing these guys on IF subreddit call these girls out where they are literally obese by BMI before starting IF and saying how they look bad now, or stop losing weight, and were hotter before. I also want to tone a bit and trim down a little but yeah, I'm sure a lot of people would think I ""already am too thin."" I am currently 115 lbs and 5'4"". No, I don't need to lose anything to be healthy, I just feel personally more confident with a more toned body, and because I have really small features (aka no/really small boobies lol) I look best at like 112-113 lbs. 

As a side note, I'm SO glad I did not go through college with the thicc trend - currently 31 y/o - that would have been rough on me mentally as I've always been pretty thin. At least right now, I am pretty happy with myself and have goals for myself, my fiance seems to like how I look too which is a nice bonus to my confidence, so that's all that matters to me. Best of luck out there, from a fellow 12 year old boy."
fatlogic,fddzoob,t1_fddmgca,1578327852.0,"Did you see the one about Michael Phelps? I had a long response typed up and was like ""why bother trying to get through to this person"" and deleted before posting. Lost story short, they were saying Michael Phelps ate ""unhealthy"" food while training - yeah I'm sure he had to eat a lot of high calorie food because burning up to 2-4k calories per day training, but to act like a gold medal Olympic athlete doesn't have a nutritionist or that his high calorie food is = to high calorie fast food is garbage. Or even if he did eat McDonalds while burning 4k calories a day (seems unlikely), that does not mean the average person should eat like Michael Phelps??"
fatlogic,fddyxwc,t1_fdcw9e5,1578327354.0,"I was thinking the same thing - I am in an intermittent fasting subreddit and I can't tell you how many times I see guys comments on a girl's before and after picture saying that they were better looking overweight, or are too skinny or too muscular...I think a gym body is not really what most guys are interested in - with the exception of an instagram body with likely breast/butt implants lol. If you lose those assets in the gym or to losing weight, guys will grossly call you out on it online."
tumblr,fddoyu5,t1_fddnb0p,1578319993.0,"I’m pretty sure not trying treatment was what killed him, that and the survival rate of this disease. Have you even met anyone with pancreatic cancer? The treatment is so aggressive it is hard for the patients to even eat. And likely they still die anyways after undergoing said treatment. It’s a death sentence, and if eating fruit towards the end of his life gave him some form of control, so be it."

fatlogic,fc5heqt,t1_fc16q67,1577457664.0,"Yeah, being vegan has really nothing to do with weight, just eliminating animal products from your life. There are all kinds too, I’m a healthy weight, pretty athletic vegan, but I’ve definitely met obese vegans too."
