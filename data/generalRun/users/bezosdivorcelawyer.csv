She said the greatest feeling ever was mentioning that professor in her first published book in the “acknowledgments” section. She wrote something along the lines of “And thank you to NAME for her help while I was still a student for helping me hone my research methods and making sure I never gave up. I look forward to one day reading a book she publishes as well.” Because the mean professor never actually got around to finishing the book. She said her editor made her take the last sentence out cause it was sounding too obviously passively aggressively spiteful lol"

Sure, just including it was nice, but the sentiment is lost when they're bragging about how progressive they are for doing the bare minimum.

It's not like gay people suddenly popped into existence either. There's shows like Steven Universe airing with the lesbian wedding of a main character being planned specifically so other countries can't cut it without disrupting the entire season. Nickelodeon had  Legend of Korra end with a same sex couple three years ago and the studio is doing just fine. Disney has more money than god and could actually have significant representation without going under."

That didn't stop Disney from patting themselves on the back and praising how progressive they were, though. The same with the one gay dude in Endgame. Disney will throw in minor scenes mentioning gay people that can easily be cut to be marketed in anti-gay countries, call themselves woke, and then forbid any scenes that show main characters being gay despite the actors and directors wanting it in. (ex: Tessa Thompson and Taiki Waititi both fought to include a scene showing Valkyrie was bisexual. Oscar Isaac has been a vocal advocate for Poe and Finn ending up together.)

The speeder crash thing I can understand because she's still in mourning and panics when faced with the fact that another person she cares about is going to die in front of her. 

But yeah, I really wish they did more with her. (And Phasma lol) I really wanted to like TLJ because all the press tour stuff showed them all really excited to be in Star Wars together and I got hyped up and it sort of fell flat for me 'cause it just...didn't matter because it seems like both Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams refused to collaborate and just tried to undo the previous movie.

They definitely could have done more with his character. Decades of First Order brainwashing definitely would have had an effect on his psyche. (Could have been brought up after his attempted suicide mission in TLJ and how he viewed himself as disposable for the sake of the rebellion)

This sorta makes sense that Luke and Leia would know and not tell her. They both saw what having a sith grandfather did to Ben/Kylo and would have been wary of her maybe emulating *her* grandfather.
