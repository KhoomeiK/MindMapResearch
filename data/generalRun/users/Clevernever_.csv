NoStupidQuestions,fdtckvv,t1_fds3247,1578714837.0,"But part of what makes it so cool (not a resident, therefore tourist POV) is that it’s still going. When you go visit to see these things, it’s not like a museum of old things that are reconstructed to operate, but old things that are still in use with the intent to continue that way as long as it shall be.  It almost makes it, I don’t want to say personal because it’s not, but... feel like you’re seeing part of history as it continues to happen as opposed to seeing it after it’s completed.  It’s not as big of a draw if it’s something that’s done and happened. Actually, strike that, it’s not an extended draw if it’s already happened after a period of time. I don’t think the draw to visit Buckingham Palace as a tourist would be as high in 100 years if it wasn’t still in use by the monarchy. If it became that way tomorrow, yeah, there’d still be heavy tourism. But, as the generations go away that were alive while it was in full operation, the amount of tourism (for wanting to see monarchy landmarks) would probably decline over time. 

I’m addressing this to the point about the landmarks, such as Buckingham Palace. I don’t really have insight into the family that makes up the monarchy and their personal lives."

With Adam Conover” called “Big Tech, Workism and Killing Companies in the Crib with Scott Galloway”. It’s been really interesting to hear Scott’s opinion on how this market isn’t truly capitalism because these Big Tech companies are being government subsidized in round about ways. Never heard of him before. I’m definitely not super educated on all these topics, but I found it to be an interesting take and thought I’d pass along!"

I worked in medical sales for a good bit, I talked with providers about their frustrations with your points 1 & 2 than I ever did product. First questions I would get asked when discussing a medication, before even talking about what the medicine was for... “what insurances cover it? what’s the tiering? what’s the prior approval rate looked like?”. It opened my eyes so much to how these independent practices are being overtaken by larger, more business savvy, hospitals/chains and then treating the PCP like chickens laying eggs. The practices’ productivity isn’t measured in the quality of the eggs, but in how many eggs those chickens are laying. They had quotas that were just as stressful as mine and I was in sales?! 

What kind of a system is that a provider is told they must see at least X number of patients a day, limited by time to fit in those patients, limited by insurance to provide the type of care they needed, and on top of that limited by the government/insurance/record keeping system they are required by the government to have on the type of care they can provide for a patient when they come in (EMRs became a requirement back in.... 2014? 2015? unless the practice wanted to pay a hefty fine. Granted, I do think they have their benefits, but still.) 

Not excusing the very unhygienic, unprofessional, and dismissive experience that OP had. That’s not okay. Just agreeing with you that what’s also not okay is having a provider break down to a sales rep  over a product lunch one day (I’m proud to say I developed some really great working relationships with some of my providers, but none that were deep enough that this level of emotional support was normal)  because they are so stressed with the amount of patients they are being required to see per day by the new hospital system that bought their practice out to the point that they have to require a patient to schedule another appointment if they have any medicinal questions that go outside of what the patient originally requested the appointment for because the EMR, owners, insurance company, and time physically will not let them. And it’s so difficult for them, because on one hand, yeah they could go into independent practice, but the access they get to facilities and equipment for their patients through the healthcare system... they could never afford it alone. Much less compete with larger chains with insurance. They got into the profession to care for people (the good ones) and that’s what their advanced training is in, not running a business on top of all of it. 

Seeing this ugly side of healthcare actually changed my life in a non-hyperbolic way. I was in medical sales to try and help me make some money to pay down my undergrad student loans before taking on more so I could hopefully go back to school to be a PA. That had been my plan since I started college. Ever since, I’ve been working to try and get into public health to help reform the mess that’s been made on the government side because the whole reason I even dreamed of being a provider is because I want to help sick people. That experience taught me one the toughest realities of my adult life, I’d be able to help 10, maybe even 100, times the sick people through laws and regulations than I ever would in an examine room. 

All this to say internet friend, keep fighting the good fight and keep raising the awareness. Also, if you have any tips on how someone can get started in making a profession out of working for healthcare reform.... please send them my way. I’ve been trying for over three years now to break in anyway I can, no luck.

wholesomememes,fdd1kvh,t3_ekjuf0,1578291154.0,"“You know most people look through
Their wallets or their pocketbooks
And way down at the bottom
Past the credit cards
Baby pictures and so on
You usually find a little old
Piece of dog eared poetry

I's cleaning out my wallet the other day
And I ran across a whole bunch of I. O. U. 's
Some of them thirty-five years overdue

And you know the funny thing
All these I. O. U. 's are owed to one person
And I kinda felt like that maybe now
Would be a pretty good time
For an accounting

Mom, I sure hope you're listening

Sweet lady, I owe you for so many things
A lot of services
Like night watchman for instance
Lying awake nights listening for coughs
And cries and creaking floorboards
Ha ha, and me coming in too late

Boy, you had the eye of an eagle
And the roar of a lion but you always
Had a heart as big as a house

I owe you for services like
Uh, short order cook, chef, baker
For making sirloin out of hamburger
And turkey out of tuna fish and
Big old strapping boys out of leftovers

I owe you for cleaning services
The daily scrubbing of face and ears
All work done by hand

And for the frequent dusting
Of a small boys pants to try to
Make sure that he led a spotless life

And for washing and ironing
That no laundry could ever do
For drying the tears of childhood and
Ironing out the problems of growing up

I owe you for services as a bodyguard
For protecting me from the terrors
Of thunderstorms and nightmares
Heh, and too many green apples

And Lord knows I owe you
For medical attention
For nursing me through measles, mumps
Bruises, bumps, splinters and spring fever

Oh, oh, let's not forget medical advise
Important things like if you keep on
Scratching that, it'll never get well
Or if you cross your eyes
They're gonna stick like that

And probably the most
Important advice of em all
Boy, you be sure you
Got on clean underwear
In case you're in an accident

And I owe you for veterinarian services
For feeding every lost dog that I
Dragged home at the end of the rope
And for healing the pains of puppy love

And I owe you for entertainment
Entertainment that kept the household
Going during some pretty tough times

And for wonderful productions at
Christmas, 4th of July, birthdays
And for making make believe come true
And you did it all on such a limited budget

I owe you for construction work
For building kites and confidence
Hopes and dreams and somehow
You made em all touch the sky

And for cementing together a family
So it would stand the worst kinds
Of shocks and blows and for laying down
A good strong foundation to build a life on

I owe you for carrying charges
For carrying me on your books
For the necessities of life
That a growing boy somehow
They just gotta have

Things like, ha ha
A pair of high top boots with a
Little pocket on the side
For a jackknife

And one thing, Mom, I'll never forget
When there were two pieces of pie
And three hungry people
You were always the one who decided
Well, I'm not really that hungry anyhow

These are just a few of the things
For which payment is long overdue
The person that I owe em to
Worked very, very cheap
She managed by simply doing without
A whole lotta things that she needed herself

My I. O. U. 's add up to more
Than I could ever hope to repay
But you know the nicest thing about it all
That I know that she'd mark
The entire bill paid in full
For just one kiss and four little words

Mom, I love you.”
