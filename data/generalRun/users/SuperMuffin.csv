There's still countries with no people fit to diagnose or work with autistic adults. 

The understanding of it is BAD. People have built their understanding on listening mostly to parents of autistic kids, not to grown autistic people. And the latter have just started speaking up.

One thing that I would suggest rethinking (or if you could give further info) is him *accepting* people. He hasn't necessarily accepted people in the sense that 'normal' dogs accept people.  My dog loves quite a few people now, but she's still reactive to *actions* if not in a relaxed mood. For example, she's very reactive in our building, and I had to explain to a few people now that it doesn't matter if she *knows* them, she will react differently in this context because she gets nervous and/or protective in the building. 

I find she reacts in two different ways: 1. reactive due to her state of arousal (any actions paying attention from strangers, any action from people she knows that she's not expecting, even certain actions from me), 2. reactive due to actions (even when calm, some actions will trigger a response).

I don't know how clear that is but what I'm saying oftentimes, it doesn't matter if she's accepted a person, she still reacts to certain stimuli and that's what I have to have in mind when around people, even those that she loves."

She's unsocialised, was taken away from her mother at birth, has some sort of singleton syndrome and the strong pain since the beginning of her life seems to have impacted her to react with aggression straight away. Each one of these issues presents with its own set of problems (sensitivity to touch, nervousness, barking, biting, fear of the unknown), and combinations of it make for other problems (inability to deal with frustration ...). Paired with her *really* strong prey drive, it takes a lot of both knowledge and observation to dissect elements to her behaviour. :(

The foundation of her training is teaching her how to handle her emotions via various calming techniques and building her confidence. She's extremely food motivated, has the working drive of an average malinois and we have a strong bond, so training is really going as well as it could. I know she needs a certain amount of time. I just sometimes get frustrated upon a specific element of her issues that I wish I could solve faster. (another one, for example, is holding rocks in her mouth :D)"

SelfCareCharts,ffbobnp,t1_ffbnhjs,1579775494.0,"Exactly that. The aceptance of autism is based on the realisation that most of our issues stem from living in a world that makes it difficult for us to do anything from communication to *basically everything*. People aren't saying ""Oh do go on banging your head against the wall"", people are saying ""You have to understand why he's banging his head against the wall so you do away with that form of expression"". Imagine how fucking *frustrated* you must be to do that?  It's a symptom, not *autism.* I sometimes melt down, and I know why, and I can mostly tell people why. They can't. They've tried, and can't, and it's unbearable. It's heartbreaking. Understanding the underlying reasons for certain behaviour is even more so important for autistic people who are also mentally challenged - they're not only mentally challenged, they're operating on a brain slate that is still not understood. 

We need to understand autism. We don't, yet, or at least most neurotypical people don't. It's why it's important to understand and accept the autistic brain as it is, because only then can we move on from such behaviours and accommodate both autistic people and their caretakers. And a big step towards it is autistic people themselves leading the way."

SelfCareCharts,ffbgmj7,t1_ffayjdk,1579764414.0,"You're close, but it's still a bit different. We can decipher body language, it's just that we do it with the ""rational part of the brain"". We do everything with the same part of the brain. A lot of issues stem from there as you can imagine how exhausting it must be to ""study"" every day, all day, in all interactions.

At it's core, autism is a difference in how we process information. It subsequently affects 1. social communication (we only communicate in data exchange, whilst NTs also partly communicate for ""social bonding"" - think small talk, but in the widest possible sense), 2. social interaction (everything you want people to know, you say, whereas there's ""self evident"" things for NTs) 3. rigidity of thinking (new information needs to be thoroughly examined, like during a scientific process, which makes communication about irrelevant things pretty taxing for both parties, or making plans, or any change really) and 4. hypersensitivity in comparison to NTs (sensory stimulation is felt more strongly, and that can be good, when you're comfortable, or bad, when you're not, or just bad overall for some people). There's other things that seem to come with our neurology, like stimming (certain movements, or vocalisations, can make you feel almost euphoric or calm you down or relax you), the lack of proprioception ... We also get interested in a few topics and explore them deeply, as opposed to many, explored on a more shallow level. It comes off as obsessions. I probably missed a ton.

Autism is a braintype that isn't hard to understand once you realise that what's self evident to you, isn't self evident to us, and vice versa. We can understand each other pretty well through proper communication, as we both behave logically considering our neurology (well, NTs sometimes need help with that, but we still love you :)). There's also people that are both autistic and mentally challenged. They're two different things.

Not all non-verbal autistic people are mentally challenged, it's important to note."
TwoXSex,ffa0w1j,t1_ff9qru5,1579725637.0,"To give you an alternate view, I get like OP too. Masturbation is exhausting because it doesn't really help, and only super excessive amounts help for *a bit*. Which can take hours. And again, doesn't *really* do much. It's about fucking, good old primal sex.

My only solution is basically find a partner for it. It's a need and you're better when you have it fulfilled. Life is wonderful when you have regular sex.

The more probable scenario, imo, is the change in routine. My dog's reactivity increased, for example, when I stopped working and spent MORE time with her. The new schedule was theoretically way more suited to her, yet the change itself threw her off. It happens to some dogs.

My suggestion would be to ASAP establish a strict routine that will get him back to a feeling of safety. Be consistent every day and make it simple. It should go away in a matter of few weeks, avoid triggers until then.

Hair up in a high ponytail (so it doesn't touch my face and doesn't bother my movements like a bun would - can't lie on your back, gets ruined by jumping ... ). Get a good hairband in that sense.

Very few social rules apply to the gym outside of ""take care of yourself and don't bother other people"". I love it.

The person clearly doesn't understand what autism is and is clearly just being hysterical and trying to make their feelings sound like ... idk, thoughts. And it's so obvious they're having one of those neurotypical meltdowns when they stop making any rational sense.  And it's something you see often, people insisting on something with their feelings. Now, as hurtful as that has been throughout my life (people lashing out at you with negative emotion, whilst you have no idea what you did ""wrong""), doesn't it make you *see* the neurotypical brain in a different light? How they refuse to, or can't use it sometimes?   
For some context, I came to the party quite late (28 yrs old) and have always been considered above average, and then I realised everything that people considered to be of great value about me was due to the very different nature of my brain. The ""content"" of being autistic is actually what most of neurotypical society appreciates (systematic thinking, depth of knowledge and subsequent understanding of an area ...). I guess that gave me both confidence that most early diagnosed peeps lack, and an understanding of the differences between the neurotypical brain type and an autistic one. There's just this huge divide between what autism is made up to be and what autism is. 

I guess my view is rethink why you're upset. I find things like this give me general confidence as it allows me to understand the braintypes are different, but equal. They both have their ""weaknesses"", it's just that the neurotypical ones are normalised and ours aren't. We're conditioned to feel ashamed of what we are, but there are no objective reasons to be. Thinking it through helps, I find.

Additionally, it might help to know that this is what the same test looks like in puppies. This is how they ""fetch"" in this context. The test is well established mostly among breeders and shelter workers. If you look into it, you might find some answers on your first paragraph! (it's about taking social social cues and bringing stuff, not doing fetch, but that wasn't necessary to clarify before - I'm assuming most of your concerns with mouthiness etc have been accounted for, as they're true for puppies too). I wish I could provide links, as it's really interesting stuff. They do the test on worst case rescues and such to determine their potential in recovering. The retrievers are way easier to rehabilitate. I even did it with my unsocialised wild girl as a joke (and out of desperation for ANY sign that I should persist :D) I wish I could provide links, but I studied it in my native language and have no idea what to look for on Google - and ""the fetch test"" only brings up a thousand results on this particular experiment now :)

If I understand you correctly, I disagree that them being hand raised is something not accounted for, but rather something necessary for the experiment. As fetching is considered instinctual in this context, they have to be exposed to circumstances that bring that instinct out, which is always going to include being comfortable around humans (for wolves, hand raised from a really young age). The difference is, up until now it seemed clear cut that the ""fetch instinct"" (dumbed down) has been bred into dogs as a species. If wolves, hand raised, display the same instinct, it means the instinct may have not been acquired by dogs through their domestication, but existed in wolves already. They just weren't exposed to circumstances where it would be displayed."

Before her departure, and when we already knew it was going towards the end, I scheduled all my time around her. I slept in the living room, I fed her by hand, I sunbathed with her, I did just about everything she enjoyed. I made sure I was *present.* I did all that before, sure, but the last week was me just being in the moment with my girl. Feeling grateful. Doing the things I was doing *for her.*

Think back on what a life she had. On the things you did together and the experiences she got with her people. Think about what she gave you and feel thankful. It might help to say it out loud or write it down.

You've listened to her and she's told you she isn't really enjoying any activities anymore. Her life has been completed with wonderful activities and she won't do them anymore, her heart has been filled with love for people and animals and she's done accepting people and animals into her heart. It's the last chapter of the book. She knows it, you know it, and you better read that last chapter. You might see the letters only through tears, you might not want to read it but that won't change much. So you better read it with happiness in your heart because it's still something she is giving you and you're giving her.

Turns out it isn't, it's just the way the world works on an intuitive level for NTs. I find that the réalisation makes a world of difference - my issues aren't due to the fact that I'm wrong or bad, they're due to the fact that everyone's brain works different to mine. That's just a fact that carries no value judgment. People that are not autistic, or have ADHD, or any other condition, likely won't ever *understand* just what it is.

People who judge people that aren't doing them any harm can fuck right off. The times when being autistic meant you didn't know how to behave should be long gone. If the number of people on the autism spectrum vs. neurotypical spectrum we're reversed and the world catered to an autistic frame of mind, they'd be weird. Not saying it's the way it should be, just painting a thought experiment to say that we feel out of place because of chance, not wrongdoing.

aspergirls,fdjmy98,t1_fdj3bwt,1578478706.0,"You are not the issue. God, posts like that make me so mad and sad and... Christ. 

The reason they are mad at you is that the neurotypical way of communicating is considered ""good"" and ours is considered bad. They accused you of lacking empathy because the way you phrased it made them feel bad. The issue is, it didn't make them feel bad for reasons on your side, but theirs. There is nothing inherently good or bad in your sentences. How often have people's reactions made you feel bad? Are they toxic? You are feeling shitty now because of their response, yet the default position is that you are the bad guy. You, a minority, someone that never learned about their neurology growing up. The position is a given - when your innocent actions make them feel bad, you lack empathy (because the world NT, by default), yet when their innocent actions make us feel bad, that's our ""disorder"". 

Yes, there are ways of learning to understand NTs and to change our communication to something, frankly, less efficient. But I think you should start with introspection and communication with those close to you. You're not one to be ""fixed"". You're well meaning and you communicate in the way that comes naturally to you. Do you understand yourself? Why do you think you're toxic? What do YOU think about the reasons that people say you're an asshole? When you understand yourself, you can explain yourself to your people. It's not fair to put all the burden of communication on you.

To give a bit of background info, as I am feeling a bit angry about the issue and it may show. I've focused on language and communication all my life without knowing about my neurology. I read stories and books all day everyday till the age of 15. At 20, I started learning negotiation and focused on body language and microexpressions, along with psychology of communication in that context. I took over that course and taught fellow students about it (???!! That's fucking comedy, eh). I thought everyone communicated like I ended up communicating - setting the passage of info five exchanges ahead by manipulating conversation, managing their emotions by picking words and reading and responding and manipulating body language.

Then, at 29, I found out I was autistic around the time that I completely burned out and that's where I still am.

There is no way for us to communicate the way NTs do. It is the very core of our brain. We can learn to imitate them, but it takes more mental energy. And it's not worth it to bear that burden alone.

I guess my point, besides venting a bit, is that the issue isn't you. The issue is that we communicate differently and we inadvertently hurt or confuse each other. Mostly, we hurt them by speaking in data and leaving the ""implication field"" empty, and they mostly respond to it implication, so their brains just come up with the implication (e.g. Did you take the charger has some sort of accusatory undertones that ""do you have the charger"" doesn't, according to NTs, but both questions simply look for different info). They mostly confuse and hurt us by their negative emotional responses in communication, or sensory ones, or just mostly confuse us and leave us powerless by not communicating info clearly. This is oversimplified.

I realise this comment doesn't have much practical advice. But I've lived through the psychological trauma of assuming I was to blame for everything that other people told me I was, and feeling guilty about something that wasn't bad in any way. I think understanding the issue, and realising your worth in that context, is painfully necessary for a lot of us. There are tonnes of advice out there for autistic people how to live better with NTs. But some of us just hopelessly need to *know* it's not us. It's never been us. We're not bad just because people say we are. You're not toxic. You're well meaning. You're good. You're strong. Use language that reinforces that every day.

It's not you that's the issue, it's the difference in communication and that depends on both sides. Don't feel like the only way you're good is if you carry that burden yourself."

It made no sense, and it hurt. Physically, and mentally. 

So I started observing people and seeing what made them popular. Seeing what made them like each other. Seeing what's ""cool"" and learning what the concept of ""cool"" is. And then I started applying that knowledge. 

I went from a gentle, loving girly girl to an aggressive tomboy pretty fast. There were elements of hate for feminine things, because I noticed they were considered bad by people. Pink and blonde was supposed to be dumb, so it was good not to like it and people who liked it were supposed to be dumb.
