Heck, 40."

depression,fepq9qr,t1_feppqzc,1579327686.0,"Thank you so much.
I feel better on my own, honestly.
I feel lonely when there's people out there I should be seeing, but when I imagine myself totally alone, I feel free."
demisexuality,fepo7bp,t3_eplgf1,1579325856.0,I believe I'm biromantic but I've never had the opportunity to explore other types of attraction with another woman. Mostly I just am aesthetically attracted to other women and can imagine myself romantically attracted to them as well but up until this point I've been only hetero.
demisexuality,fepo2u5,t3_epnxg4,1579325746.0,Are............are you me?
demisexuality,fepn7c5,t1_femti7m,1579325006.0,There are dozens of us! Dozens!
demisexuality,fepn5ng,t1_fen1f6j,1579324968.0,OMG this makes sense!
demisexuality,fepmwt9,t3_epuxj0,1579324771.0,"DAE feel that they're deeply romantic, and that romance = emotional connectivity and bond, and therefore in order to truly enjoy sexual acts they must be in an emotionally close and romantic mood?"
demisexuality,fepmsf7,t3_epuxj0,1579324671.0,"AH! I came here to post an ask about this very thing. Been wondering the same thing of myself lately. Surely there are points between ace and demi, and I still don't know where I fit on that spectrum or how to tell what's the telling factor :("
ruby,fepcpvg,t3_eolm8x,1579317300.0,"Wow, how cool you're offering this, it seems difficult to find people willing to teach and mentor. And that's exactly what I'm looking for!"
depression,feljpr5,t3_eefgwt,1579223820.0,"I... Feel this, yeah.
I think sometimes I'm meant to be alone, because all I seem to do is make mistakes, cause drama, and hurt people.
I hate myself.
I would be better off completely alone, a hermit in the woods. The fewer people interact with me the fewer opportunities there are to hurt anyone.

If I was just alone, what else would there be to worry about?"
depression,feljkit,t3_en2qbu,1579223720.0,I feel this so strongly
depression,felj9qi,t3_el7p7n,1579223513.0,Well this is a mood

userexperience,fdzs73d,t1_fdnx6gv,1578794547.0,"Thank you for all the feedback! I have a ton of questions but wondering if commenting here might be inefficient, would PM be okay to get some more specific questions about my case studies and design ideas answered?"
userexperience,fdnk3tz,t3_eif1yo,1578587470.0,"I'm not yet in the UX field as a professional, but I've had several roles as a UX researcher and UX/Data Viz in volunteer projects. 
My background is in Fine Arts/Painting and in 2017 I attended a coding boot camp, which opened my eyes to the wonderful world of user experience and I'm doing all I can to make that career move. 

My website is www.oliviacolecreative.com 

I'm looking to start applying to junior roles soon. I
have one project still to add to my Works list, but
before I do I'd like to hear from some more
seasoned professionals about how I could
improve the general layout and content of my
site.

Does the site flow well visually? Are my pages for
About Me, Work, etc well organized?
What about the visual organization of each page?
Can anyone comment on how I've written about
my roles in each project and how descriptive they
are to demonstrate my process and skill/eligibility
to an employer?

I have some ideas of how I'd like to redesign it, this is just a very basic Wix site and it's a little finicky to work with, but I want it to reflect my aesthetic, as well as showcase my ability to find problems, design solutions, and work well with multidisciplinary teams. 

The problem I'm facing with the projects I've worked on is that I don't have a ton of documentation of all the sketches and things we worked on at Civic. So how can I fill my works pages with content to highlight that I did, in fact, play a role in these projects? Hmm. 

There's not much here, and I am just starting out,
but I need my portfolio to be as good as possible
to start landing job offers. Thanks!"
MakeupAddiction,fcb0pz5,t1_fcad2le,1577580389.0,Oh great! Thank you!
MakeupAddiction,fca5cr4,t1_fc8hwkr,1577563288.0,"Thanks for the recommendations! I'm not finding anything about Robert Walsh except the actor, is that right?
Anyway, I think my bf would probably go fairly low key, not like a full on glitter beard with neon cut crease or anything .... xD"
