I have URLs like ""https://metalslug.fandom.com/wiki/[filename]"" they're links that refer directly to a whole page, not to a file. I got these links from the /wiki/Category:Artwork page.

There's a link within each page within a ""original file"" hyperlink that leads to the file URL, but a part at the end is randomly named. Those all start with ""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/metalslug/images/*"".

I'd need something to recognize the hyperlink and grab it in each page. I thought of HTTracker, but I can't seem to make that only recognize and only download that single hyperlink from each page. 

How can I do that? I tried downloading a single page as a whole through HTTracker to see if I could find the file amongst all the downloaded stuff, to no avail."
