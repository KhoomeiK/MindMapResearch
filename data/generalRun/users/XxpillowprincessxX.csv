iamatotalpieceofshit,ffhi6ch,t1_ffgei0a,1579936340.0,"When you say he “drunk himself to death” I hope you mean “died of cirrhosis of the liver”. My husband’s bio dad was also a huge piece of shit and died of cirrhosis. Moved his gf in after his wife (husband’s mom) was in a car accident that left her paralyzed. They didn’t have an open relationship. She had just recently found out about the affair, before her car was run off the road. I’m willing to bet David set that up. He put his service pistol to his wife’s head (cop) and said if she didn’t take all her pain meds he would shoot her. Thankfully he was so drunk he left the room and she was able to drag herself to a phone. He threw my brother-in-law into a wall and broke his nose when he was 2. I hope he died alone, in agonizing pain, reflecting on his shitty life and worrying about hell."

IMO, the smaller art communities especially are great for positive critiquing. They’ll tell you what you can improve, and what you did right. /r/learnart is a good one, though a touch sensitive. I’m perma banned because a user said I “stole” art for submitting to /r/coloringcorruptions and was talking crap. So I pointed out how my “unoriginal” work had more upvotes than all of their originals. Petty, yes. Was I in the wrong? Yes. I’m not disputing the ban, but was the rabble rouser also banned for attacking me because they don’t like my style? No.
