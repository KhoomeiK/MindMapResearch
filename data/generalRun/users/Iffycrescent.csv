quittingkratom,ffdwp3v,t1_ffdcudg,1579830800.0,I’ve never thought of going to AA meetings.  That might be a good ideas for me.  Do you mind me asking why you want to quit CBD use?  I’ve always been under the impression that it’s really good for you with almost no negatives.

PS4Deals,felw8ik,t1_fek47ux,1579232494.0,I’m gonna piggyback off of your comment to ask another question.  I redeemed everything on my phone and then an error happened and I lost the page.  How do I go about downloading the theme?  I tried searching “Wrap-Up” on PSN and didn’t get anything

“Acronym for Inflated Lat Syndrome. ILS is a primal threat/mating display observed in the human male. The ILS display involves the male human holding out it’s arms away from it’s body at approximately a 20-40 degree angle and then walking with a slow deliberate gait inorder to look more imposing to other humans. The posture is used primarily as a form of non-verbal communication such as a mating display to attract or impress females or as a defense or dominance posture to appear larger to a threat or to intimidate rival males. 

ILS displays can be observed : 
In the gym after an insecure male works out for 3-5 minutes. 
On the beach when a single male approaches a group of females. 
When a male enters a bar or dance club. 
When a male is too scared to throw the first punch in a fight. 
On the outside of mosh pits by the bouncer who’s had enough of sweaty punks bumping in to him.”

offmychest,fdlr6e8,t1_fdlod1n,1578530541.0,Yeah absolutely.  The only reason this post took the wind out of my sails is because I really don’t want to be seen as the guy that OP’s post was about.  I’d be mortified lol
