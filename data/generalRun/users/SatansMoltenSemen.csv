cringepics,ffdkske,t1_ffdinw1,1579822979.0,">obesity is not caused by laziness in every situation 

You’re right, but I would argue in the majority of cases it is. With obesity levels what they are, I don’t see how it’s possible that the majority of obese people are obese because of a medical or psychological reason. People live sedentary lifestyles, they drive everywhere, sit down for work, sit at home after work etc. Then they’re eating unhealthy food because it’s quick, cheap, easy or they just like it more than healthier food. 

People that are living an obviously unhealthy lifestyle and not working towards bettering themselves should be ashamed about it. Coddling and enabling it isn’t going to do them any favours when the health problems set in.

Edit ; And to add, shaming overweight people isn’t just shaming that person, it’s about the habits and lifestyle that made them that way. And this is coming from someone that was heavily overweight and got fit, i’ve put on a few pounds recently but i’m working on cutting it off again."
cringepics,ffdk8cc,t1_ffdj37n,1579822640.0,"I can do that easily since I lost weight, the rope will actually be able to hold me"
cringepics,ffdd8vg,t1_ffdbqfm,1579818434.0,"I have seen plenty of people in the body positivity movement that actively dispute the effects being overweight has on a person, even people that claim their health issues aren’t related to them being 100+ pounds overweight. They claim that they are perfectly healthy when they are far from it. Being told that they’re obese also isn’t fat shaming, it’s either telling them a fact (they are actually obese) or a lie (they’re not obese and are being called it anyway). If someone is obese and depressed then they need to work on both issues.

I never had a target weight, my goal was to get skinnier and healthier than I was at that point in time. So I just ate less and got more active, at my heaviest I was around 16 stone (230 pounds I think). Got down to 13 stone (180ish). Currently I’ve put on weight over the holidays, but I was ashamed looking in the mirror and am now back in the gym.

That’s the biggest issue here, not everyone that is fat has some problem that makes them fat. Sure, there are definitely outliers with medical and serious psychological issues that get them there, but claiming that’s the norm is not right. Most people that are fat are lazy, and aren’t willing to make the sacrifices to get into a healthier form. Because you’re right, it is a lifelong process, but people don’t want to work towards it. They want to eat nice food and watch tv and whatnot instead of eating healthy food and going to the gym. 

Honestly congratulations on the weight loss, the fact that you’ve put in a continued effort into bettering yourself shows me you’re not one of the lazy people. I hope you can keep it up and get yourself to where you want to be."
cringepics,ffd9myy,t1_ffcw0uz,1579816143.0,"I’ve been fat, the shame I felt at the state of my body is what motivated me to make changes. Smokers do get shamed, people immediately label smokers unattractive, people say smokers smell, people tell them it will kill them, hell there’s pictures on every packet of cigarettes showing what will happen when you smoke.

Being overweight is becoming more and more normalised with the body positivity movement, which is ridiculous and the opposite of what should be happening. Coddling people and telling them they’re beautiful and perfect as they are isn’t going to motivate anyone to change, why change if there’s nothing wrong with how you currently are?

If someone dives into food as a coping mechanism for everything then they have some psychological issues that need to be resolved, just like addicts or alcoholics. But that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be ashamed of the results of those issues."
