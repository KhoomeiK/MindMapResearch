WatchPeopleDieInside,ffwtjvj,t1_ffwlv3k,1580310668.0,"I think you overthink this problem a bit too far. Way too far, to be exact. Just because she ""likes her men black"" this doesn't have to include any sexual context at least for her being able to understand the phrase. Of course, it makes less sense that way if you have the knowledge level of an adult, but that doesn't mean that these 2 kids can't comprehend or say these lines without any problems.

And even if she knew the exact circumstances and understands the joke to the fullest: would that be THAT big of a problem? Imo sexuality is a way too taboo topic and gets talked over way too much. This is an issue especially in american TV (or christian households all over the world), making this a much better joke if you think about it.

If you can't laugh at this joke, i doubt you have a good sense of humor. At least you wouldn't share mine."
socialskills,ffwrvc6,t1_ffwk7nq,1580309515.0,"However: i wouldn't overdo this. If i'm to 100 % certain even after being in different moods that someone for example doesn't care about me or doesn't like me, then why should i try to trick myself into thinking otherwise? The better solution here imo: don't try to trick yourself, but try to realize that it isn't important what others think of you. And if you were the only person in the world that was ""like this"", that still wouldn't matter. You're you, and if someone doesn't like you, then fck them. Why should you give a damn about the opinion of others that don't care about at all? That's just not healthy.

What i'd suggest in this situation: try to figure out what is the case. If you're really not sure about everything, ask them how they feel about you and try to continue from there: if they don't care about you, search for other people. If they do, try to understand why you didn't see that or what you disliked about the situation you were in. And in the end: ask yourself what you really want. Do you want specific people to be around you? Do you care about the opinions of others that don't care about you THAT much? Why is that the case, and wouldn't it be a better investment to first start loving yourself.

After all: Just try to be yourself. That isn't easy at all, even more so if you aren't sure ""who you really are"", even more so in social situations like these, but that just comes with practice. Just put yourself out there in social situations and you'll learn this like any other skill as well, there isn't a big magic to it. The thing to understand here is: the longer you do it, the more attention from others you'll get. Which is kinda a problem, since those who are bad in these kind of situations need it the most, but won't get any attention at all. This is where you come in: just do it. Try to put yourself out there and just try it out a few more times. Stuff like ""These guys aren't my usual crowd"" will happen again and again and again until you'll finally find a group that you're comfortable with. Some find them instantly, some are kind of natural talents at doing stuff like that, others have to fight for it. Life isn't fair, but the thing is: you can make it fair by doing what is good for you. And if you listen to yourself deeply and ignore all those shallow feelings that just want you to sit down on the couch every night and do nothing but watching TV and browsing reddit, you'll realize what you have to do to get happier.

summonerschool,fflhie1,t3_etv191,1580039724.0,"imo, she just has to play the game more. and not normals as she does now, but indeed rankeds. this is the most important part. she'll be around her elo in no time. there aren't THAT many smurfs in iron elo. playing normals will not contribute to her finding people on her skill level really much. yes, there's basically a hidden mmr system in normals as well, but that doesn't mean that she'll get into that any faster or that this system is any better than when she's just playing ranked. however, if you play together, you shouldn't play rankeds like ever, at least until she's on a decent level. another option would be just playing rankeds together and otherwise restricting yourself to normals, so that your matched skilllevel will be the one you'll find in those games. but don't ever mix those up. see ranked and normals as different games entirely, and play one of those together and the other one only solo."
summonerschool,ffg136v,t3_etaix0,1579896168.0,"Look at your own mistakes. Ignore whatever your team does. If your team writes more than 2 sentences in the game, mute them and play as if you're solo and have to solo carry. This doesn't mean that you abandon your adc as support and go statikks shiv rapid fire cannon thresh and carry by doing damage and 1v5ing, but this means: play your best and never give up. Even if 4 out of 5 people sucked in this game and fed their asses off, the fed Vladimir toplane can still solocarry this game, if you at least give him the chance. If you surrender at 20 minutes and ignore his ""i can carry this""-calls, you won't win this game. What a surprise! (no, this definitely didn't happen in my games, and no, i definitely wasn't that fed af Vladimir while my team was 0-20. And yes, i've still carried games like this. Of course i can't if my team just surrenders -.-)

Mute spampingers, but try to communicate via pings as good as you can. 99 % of your loses could've been won if you played better yourself or communicated better what you wanted to do. 

Follow your own calls, if you think that your team doesn't make the best decisions. Ignore their ""going in"" pings and stay back yourself. If you ping them back, but then still follow them, they are in the end just encouraged to go in because you follow and ignore pings from you in the future since you won't go through with them either way and will just listen to their calls instead. -> Actions matter more than pings.

And finally: don't be an asshole. It's really easy to flame the lost/losing lanes and turn on the people making bad calls for once. But it's much harder to try and stay cool, calm and collected, not flame your teammates for whatever they might be doing, and try to carry this game just with your mental. In around 50 % of my games my teammates fed their asses off on their lanes. In like 50-60 % of those feed-games, these lanes either started crying to their jungler or complaining about the midlaner not roaming enough or whatever. How about ""if you don't have anything nice to say just say nothing?!?!?"". Is your crying going to help at all? It's going to annoy your teammates at best, so that they'll ignore the wincondition (whatever it might be in these games) in order to stop the whining teammates from whining. In these cases: just mute these kind of players. 

Also for people in these scenarios: if you're behind and get ignored from your jungler and other lanes: let them carry. It doesn't make sense to gank a lost lane and just feed more. I had a game a few days ago, where a Yasuo overstayed 24/7 in his lane. Went up, overstayed, either killed the enemy laner (props to that), but then always died to either his lane and the enemy jungler or only the enemy jungler. Well, as our jungler (Nocturne) it may not make much sense to even countergank a lane anymore if the enemy jungler (Kayn) has 5-0 stats at 10 minutes, since the best outcome is that they might kill the enemy laner, but NEVER that fed jungler as well, brining our team even more behind. Long story short: Yasuo fed his ass off until Kayn had like 10 kills and raped our team, while complaining that our jungler didn't play more around his lane ... It was a very sad game.

And ffs: don't afk, just because you're behind and ""can't do anything anymore this game"". Yes, those games aren't as much fun as those when you're 10-0 and carry your team. But for every winning lane there also has to be a losing game. You'll (statistically) win around 50 % of your lanes. And around 50 % of your games. But those games aren't always the same. If you limit yourself to winning only those games in that you also win your lane (since you'll flame or afk otherwise), you'll DEFINITELY lose more than 50 % of your games. Probably more around 60 or 70 % of them ...

I've had people flame me for my clean mental, telling me ""that's not how you win more games"". However what they couldn't explain me, is how their ""flaming strategy"" would've helped them to win more. Here is how the conversation in the post-game-screen went:

him: ur good mindeset - brought u a 49 % winrate - overall

me: and you think your mentality helps you win more?

him: but u are just stupid to think that - whatever - i have a few reports to write

I still don't know who he wanted to report. Fact is: i got a message that he got banned ...

aoe2,ffagk8b,t1_ffa2esg,1579735244.0,"yeah, i wondered if the 214 games could be true and didn't really think it would make sense. i played like double this amount of games and didn't have the same in sequence yet.

OP (i guess you refer to u/ohrulres) doesn't necessarily have to talk about that though. Yes, it could be that he's talking about 214 different people playing 2 games in a row, but it could also be just a single person spamming 214 games in sequence. The chances shouldn't change, even if with the 214 x 2 games from different people, and the 214 + 1 games with a single person playing (since if you play the 2 games in a row in sequence yourself, you could of course just take the last game you played as the first game of your next 2 games and so on, meaning that you'd do that 214 times, getting you to 215 games in total).

Also: the chances of him being wrong is kinda high, if you just look at him trying to explain to us that it's a 1/1,073,676,289 chance. I also nearly wrote that as a reply, but then i rethought about the problem and well, that obviously isn't true.

However: if you'd want to get the same result as the actual OP ( u/ggerf) got and get the same map twice with the same exact map that OP got, then you'd have the chance of 1/1,073,676,289.

You won't just have to add the amount of games up to the number of seeds, that isn't how it works, even though it mathematically means that you'll have enough tries to get every combination. The chance of getting a single incident of this happening needs a way lower amount of games played."
TryndamereMains,ff8syli,t1_ff8qu8k,1579694909.0,"doesn't make a difference anymore, does it?"
VladimirMains,ff8spl1,t1_ff8kjoz,1579694617.0,"Well, i'll try it out in a custom game. Give me 5 minutes.

If you take the said runes (the adaptive damage) you start off with 9 AP. Even if you take the health in the runes, you still get the same amount of 9 starting AP in the beginning (without dorans ring), probably because it's just a few percentages that won't fully increase the integer number.

Stats with scaling health rune:

If you take the health rune, at lvl 18 you get to a stunning 11 AP with only that rune and the adaptive damage rune.

With Proto, Zhonyas, Rabadons, MPen-Boots, Void Staff and Morellos (the default suggested build by the client) you come to a total of 3661 Health and 590 AP.

Stats without scaling health rune:

At lvl 18, you get (and who would've expected otherwise) still 9 AP, since nothing should change and Vlad doesn't gain AP per level.

With the same items as above, you get 3570 Health and 587 AP.

&#x200B;

The ""spikes"" of AP (so getting a full AP more) from the rune are at levels 3 (from 9 to 10 AP), level 12 (from 10 to 11 AP).

With Rabadons (and the resulting 40 % increase in AP, changing the underlying floating point numbers up as well), the spikes get switched to level 4 (from 181 to 182 AP), level 10 (from 182 to 183 AP) and level 17 (from 183 to 184 AP). While adding raw amounts of integer numbers (like given in most items besides rabadons passive) shouldn't really change those things up.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

So if you take the scaling health rune and go for a default build, you can get 91 HP more and 3 AP more. If you are playing vs a matchup that won't make you cry otherwise, i'd suggest going for this rune. If you're against an AD mid and AD jungle and maybe even AD top, i'd suggest running the armor instead. Even more so since Vlad base Amor is the 32th worst base armor in the game with just 23 armor. His base armor at lvl 18 is even the 20th worst one with just 79.1 armor. Adding 6 more to that will make him WAY tankier, considering the way how for example lethality works.

Either way, if you aren't familiar with any of this and don't know if the enemy has more AP or AD damage (or has some hybrids or sth like that), i'd suggest just taking the health rune.

However, in AD matchups the usual build involves rushing a Seekers, since it's a very gold efficient item. Doing so will not only increase your armor stats at once, but it'll also allow you to ""stack"" armor by last hitting while having this item. If you're a newer player, you might not have heard of the ""cloth 4""-start, which can also be a consideration then, even though that's a more advanced topic.

Also, in case you didn't know: with MR, the things are a little bit easier. There seem to be less differences from champ to champ on level 1 to 18, and there's more like a ""staircase model"" where the champs don't differ in those value TOO much. Vlad isn't good there as well, but he's on the level with most other champs, even more so with ranged AP midlaners. Either way: you could always just build a spirit visage which fits pretty good into many builds and gives especially a heal reliant champ like Vlad good values. Still: if you're facing an AP mid and AP jungle, i'd consider taking the MR rune.

The short answer to your questions is: yes, it gives damage."
aoe2,ff8qw31,t1_ff8mj0z,1579692386.0,"but since the first map isn't specific and can also be any of those 32767 maps, you have a chance of 100 % of getting any map. Since the second has to equal the first, there is a chance of 1/32767 to get this exact map again.

Or to explain it from the other point of view:

If you want the same map twice in a row, you have 1/32767 \* 1/32767 chance to get a specific map. But you have 32767 chances to get this, since you can choose any map, meaning you have (1/32767 \* 1/32767) \* 32767, which equals 1/32767."
aoe2,ff8qrup,t1_ff8hw5s,1579692227.0,"having 2 times the same map in 2 consecutive games is VERY VERY unlikely though. in fact, it's 1/32767, since whatever first map you get is random and just having any map is okay, and the second map has to equal the first map, which is a chance of 1/32767 = 0.00003. That's 0.003 % man. If that isn't VERY VERY unlikely, i don't know what is."
aoe2,ff7jjkp,t1_ff7e9mr,1579651046.0,"well, actually that isn't a bug. after all, it's just a random seed that makes the maps different, and by chance the seed was the same, as it seems. it isn't a bug, even though it's VERY unlikely to happen, depending on the amount of different seeds possible."
productivity,ff6myqp,t1_ff62cf9,1579630640.0,"same. for example: when i start something new, i tend to watch youtube videos about that specific topic. and since i want to learn something, i watch videos of people that are either very good or the best in their specific skill. which of course makes me in return look like a full retard, even if i invested hundreds of hours.

i think that alone makes it hard to climb up the ladder nowadays and just can easily give you the feeling that you're much worse than you actually are.

and i think the being mentor to yourself state is just the last state that is reachable. if you're good enough to self-maintain your own limits and push yourself to do the best, you're imo in a pretty good state. chances are that you can't find other mentors to answer your questions, because there just aren't other people THAT good in your specific skill, or they're at least not good enough to put themselves out there and say that they'd mentor you. cheers to that!

maybe this isn't what you want out of your situation, but i guess self mentoring is the best you can do on that one. just trying to optimize your own thoughts and actions to be your most productive self. good luck with that!"
productivity,ff5ykha,t1_ff5w4td,1579614405.0,"didn't do the 22 minutes yet, but my first thought was just to hold/exhale for longer. it's crazy how long you can hold your breath with this method. i did like a 3 minutes hold without any practice beforehand. that alone just feels amazing. and along with the tingling afterwards it just makes me smile randomly. i feel like i've just hacked my life with this, once again. how could i ever stop doing this on a daily basis?"
productivity,ff5s0fv,t1_ff5r4uu,1579608009.0,"It also always depends on who you compare yourself to. First of all, comparison isn't a good way to go about just anything in life. You can compare yourself for a specific reason and that's totally fine (to review your progress on a skill for example). But if you just compare yourself to others constantly for example for the sake of trying to progress faster than them, that's gonna eat you up in the long term. At least that was a problem for me and is the reason why i basically never completed anything and am cautious when it comes to new things that i definitely could be good at but just feel that barrier of entry. That time of the skill when people that are able to do it perfectly either smirk or laugh at you for failing (when they're asses). 

I've decided to go to the gym in my school days with a few friends, and i was made fun of for being weak. Yeah, no shit! That's why i'm here! Like wtf??

Meanwhile, i'm at a state in life where i'm rather confident in my skills, at least up to a certain point. I may not have a huge set of skills that are even remotely interesting for random people on the streets (these skills involve stuff like programming, being good at certain games, being relatively good at self reflection, being able to help out other people that experience problems in their lives, stuff like that), but who the f cares? If you want to go through your life without gaining skills, then that's fine as well. The important thing is that you're happy at the end of your day. Nothing else matters. (and since this seems to involve having skills and being good at them for you, i'll try to get back to this topic now)

What i could imagine what could help you as well is that instead of searching a mentor, you can be one. It isn't important to be perfect at a skill. It's the way you think about problems that come up and stuff like that which makes you helpful to ANY person on this planet regarding the skill you're mentoring. Just the other perspective. You could even be a kind of mentor for someone who has a higher set of skills than you have. Just the act of helping out and sharing your point of view and thought progress is helpful to others. And of course that'll help you out as well, as long as you consider trying to figure out their thought process and try to merge yours with theirs to get the optimal way of thinking about problems in that skill."

nosurf,femw2v0,t3_eq0l84,1579271129.0,"I don't really understand what this post is supposed to mean ... I'll try to answer anyways:

1. of course it affects dopamine. Internet ""addiction"" is a thing basically because of that. Every time you scroll, you get a small dopamine hit. If you wouldn't get dopamine out of it, you'd just be as affected as if you'd just do nothing and would be bored. Are you bored when browsing the internet? Likely not.
2. Of course it can. Information overload is basically exactly the internet. If you don't limit your usage, you'll have information overload.
3. Yes, it can also give you a state of mind that people would refer to as ""brain fog"", like information overload usually does.

The way it is interconnected is basically like this: you get brain fog because you constantly use your brain but then immediately change the topic you think about. From post to post, you basically destroy your attention span. This is what you could refer to as information overload. Overthinking might be a cause of this behavior as well and might get better when you stop (ab)using the internet that much. Meditation is also a way to counteract that, since that's a state of not constantly switching topics and using your brain to swipswap from topic to topic. Focus can also be increased that way. And you wouldn't do any of that to yourself if you wouldn't be tricked by dopamine to do that over and over again. It's a very basic system, making you more or less addicted, even more so when you ""got nothing else"" going for you atm which could distract you from the internet (paradox that it's the greatest distraction itself ...).

If you're experiencing any of those symptoms, you should definitely consider nosurf. Either just limit your internet time, or quit it cold turkey. Advice on how to do that is written all over this subreddit."
VladimirMains,felvgjr,t1_fekktyi,1579231937.0,"yeah, of course you need your core items first, so rushing a full item in that duration (like a full GA) isn't a good idea at all times (even though GA is a good item on many champs for the matter of ""playing from ahead""). i was more a toplane main than a vlad main in the last few years, and i've come to love building like 1 defensive item parts against your laner first if i'm ahead. it just gives me SO much more pressure, makes trading ez AF and if the jungler also has the same kind of damage (AP or AD) like my laner, it's basically a very cheap item that guarantees that you won't die. and i'm not playing tanks top, i'm talking about the bruisers in general (jax, (old) irelia, yasuo, riven, even gp).

now back to the topic: going early cdr is (as i said) a good way to push your lead. but how does your build work? you go for lucidity boots instead of penboots? won't that mean that you deal basically no dmg if you don't get oblivion orb? 

i'd get second back at least 1 cdr item (fiendish codex or protobelt/kindlegem = 10 %) + scaling cdr runes (\~ 5 %) + cosmic insight (5 %) + transcendence (10%), equaling 30 % instead of 22, while i have penboots at that time. i personally value movement speed pretty high and like to get boots relatively early (first back would be a bit too early though). however, that's still pretty much nearly the 45 % cdr build. but i still think that getting lucidity boots isn't that great, compared to the dmg i'd get from penboots."
VladimirMains,fekh1ch,t1_fek8fqn,1579199876.0,"cdr isn't supposed to make you a better champion in killing enemies. it's supposed to make you heal and heal and heal, while even giving your w (and r) a smaller cd making you invulnerable more often and able to escape more encounters until you've scaled up.

it basically works like this: if the enemy is trading with you and lets you get off your qs, you're probably winning either already or not losing too hard, meaning that getting cdr will let you refill your hp pretty quick by feasting the enemy or minions. if you're behind, you can still q jungle camps to get at least some hp back, which also works much faster when you have some cdr. if you're ahead already and the enemy always lets you q minions or him or just lets you all in him, then you are ok to go more ap instead, imo, since cdr won't help you there as much, while ap lets you trade with them much easier.

thing is: you'll have to get cdr eventually, just to get that crispy pool into zhonyas into pool without dying in between. also: cdr is often a kindlegem on vlad, meaning that you also get hp, which makes it harder for the enemy to kill you even when the jungler helps out. building ""defensive"" when ahead is an often recommended strategy in higher elo. if you're behind, you're supposed to build only dmg to be able to help out your team. however, with vlad you still have to get lasthits, for lasthits you have to walk up and trade eventually, meaning that you will lose hp, meaning that you'll  have to heal that back up -> cdr is perfect for that.

i personally like to make it depending on my matchup, but in like 90 % of cases i go cdr, since i feel like it just gets me more pressure in lane and gives less room for fck ups. you'll have to scale into late eventually, and going damage rather makes me overestimate my limits and i tend to go for plays that don't work. but that's rather a personal problem than a reason not to go dmg."
ProgrammerHumor,feh8klv,t1_fegm24n,1579111378.0,"Yeah, there are indeed different theories, but i've found a few good ones that actually match up and aren't really conflicting.

One is that it's a ""cooling function"" of the brain by stretching the neck and face muscles and so increasing blood flow there and by breathing in cold air. Another one is that it's just communication from the times when we didn't use words to communicate just as means of communicating that you're sleepy. And lastly the already mentioned slower breaths that require you to somehow increase your oxygen levels in your body, meaning that you have to take a deep breath."

Also, there are many ""may""s included in every article i've found. It ""may"" be responsible for cooling, it ""may"" be a respiratory function."
ProgrammerHumor,fegl48f,t1_feedf6o,1579096137.0,"Not an expert on this topic at all, it's just stuff that people told me over the years. Still, i'd explain not yawning after a marathon as a ""you already try to get the maximum amount of oxygen by breathing quickly"" -> ""yawning to increase the oxygen input isn't necessary"".

I could imagine yawning with a bag over my head (besides the panic already making you breath quickly, probably). I think it's more a matter of the cause of the low oxygen that makes you either breath quickly normally, or makes you yawn to get more O2 into your system.

So if you're relaxed and not breathing quickly, yawning makes you get more O2. If you aren't relaxed and the oxygen is low, you're probably already doing everything to get more oxygen into your system anyways and yawning would rather slow that process down (now imagine yawning after a marathon. You'd breath that slowly that you'd probably die).

Contagious yawns are just pure psychology trying to mirror people that are around us. Also, this would indeed explain it: when people around you are yawning, it makes sense to basically ""check"" if you need more oxygen and take a deep breath, just from a survival point of view. Probably some kind of gases are making you yawn when not making you take that much oxygen in, meaning that when people close to you experience this, you should check for those gases in your area as well.

Again: those are just assumptions i made. I didn't proofread every sentence and just used my logic to explain my created model (which isn't a scientific approach, of course)."

gangplankmains,fedo2i5,t3_eojpca,1579016168.0,"the thing is: people in lane will get low over time, when they fight a gp and don't have a shield or heal ability. that's just how it is. early game gp is a very good champion. but if you get into an elo, where people start dorans shield and go tabis next, you'll realize fast that gp's q doesn't do damage at all, considering the high q costs.

also, this will make some of gp's hardest matchups even harder. like against riven or irelia, where you have a hard time hitting your barrels or them getting shielded, you need a constant source of poke to at least have a chance to get them out of lane.

so i'd like to ask you something: where were you positioned, when you shot all those q's on your enemy? in the enemy minion wave or even behind it? probably not. chances are that you're in an elo in that people just let you q them for free over and over again. do people who play ranged champs like quinn/vayne/lucian/jayce top complain about them only having to autoattack the enemy to make them low? i highly doubt that.

and btw, if you nerf gp now in any way, he'll be completely out of the game, considering that he isn't direclty S tier right now, but rather more B or even C tier already. meanwhile constantly sitting at a low winrate in high elo and rarely giving onetricks a chance to hit challenger, just because of the way he interacts with the jungle and can't fight for objectives well in early skirmishes.

&#x200B;

so i'd want to ask you one last thing: while you may q your opponent until he's dead in lane and that feels bad, you still have to make big plays lategame with your barrels to have an impact. simply using your q then just won't be enough. so you really consider carrying with gp too easy compared to other champs? did you try those champs for once? stuff like malphite, stuff like maokai, ornn (who is utterly broken atm for the amount of skill he requires). those champs don't need skill at all. you get some kind of broken numbers or ability and the only thing you do all game is work around that. that isn't even true, they don't even have to work around that to make their champ work in lategame. just because gp's q doesn't feel like you outskill the opponent still means that he'll position himself in a good engagerange for most toplaners, meaning that those could be easy gank setups as well.

also you just have to be a new player, considering that gp's q spam was WAY worse just a few months/years back before they nerfed the mana costs on his q, even before the time of time war tonic and biscuits ...

&#x200B;

so let's sum it up a bit: while gp's laning phase is indeed strong, he can easily get all in'ed. if not by his laner alone, then by laner and jungler. when pressured hard like that, gp loses all his strength completely. his rather okish 1v1 poke (compared to other champs, like ranged tops) is necessary for him to at least dominate in lane when 1v1ing, since again: in a 1v2, he's one of the worst champs top, being very squishy and easy to exploit (enemies can focus on barrels and deny those; 2 enemies with just 2 cc spells of some way shouldn't have a hard time killing gp; he can get dove easily on huge waves and can't counterpush effective with low waveclear in early). so if you want to nerf him in his 1v1 potential, you need to give his 1v2 and/or lategame a HUGE buff. imo neither is a good idea, and i'd rather give his early an even bigger buff, bringing him up to a good winrate in higher elo again and making him viable there (again, considering that he's basically completely reliant on his jungler or on the afk-ness of the enemy jungler). even his late isn't THAT strong atm. and considering that klepto got removed, he'll probably have a hard time carrying against tanks again as well, armor being cheap af."

Even though i'm the youngest of 4 siblings, but pretty much same story with being bullied (not chubby, but red hair. wanna argue what's worse? xD). I often enough feel like i'm a burden to my friends. But as i realized even more now, that feeling is actually the only problem. I'm not a problem myself, but this feelings just alienates me from my friends when we go out for example. I don't have that many friends that are ""active"" and really meet up somewhere and whatnot (gamer friends), but when we meet, i tend to feel excluded and sad for no real reason after a few hours. One of those friends is a big crush of mine, and i knew from the beginning that it wouldn't lead anywhere. Came out to her (not expecting her to want a relationship), and surprise: also didn't get one. We're still very good friends and basically text daily, even more since i told her about my feelings and how i also felt that i'm just not good enough for basically anyone, myself included. I'm having very negative thoughts from time to time because of that, and she helped me through these hard times (as she's the only one that i can actually talk to about my feelings basically in my whole life until this very moment). Sometimes you just need someone to talk to. She's basically working on fixing me and my negative thought processes, just for the sake of being a friend and nothing else.

Often enough just talking about it even when i'm just the one writing (she often doesn't answer right away as my texts are quite long ...), i still feel a good relief. Talking about it lets me reflect how i feel, why i feel like it, and also lets me analyze (up to a point) if those feelings are rational and if i should ""let me feel them"" or just try to drop those feelings. It really feels like i've been emotionally fcked up for basically my whole life now, starting pretty early on. But i think it's myself where i have to start making a difference. What would it matter to someone out there if i am sitting here crying? Why would i stay in this misery and not change a thing just because of my past? Am i THAT ugly? Am i THAT annoying to be around? I don't think that i would've had friends to begin with if that was the case. I just feel unloved and that nobody would like me, even when i'm around my friends. And that isn't because they're not good friends. They're trying to make me feel good and are trying to include me (partially, there's a few outliers as well, but i guess they're everywhere in life). It's to 100 % just my insecurities that make me feel unhappy in those situations. And i guess those insecurities will be destroyed at some time in my life if i just keep following those feelings and try to get down to their root. I also don't think that i'm the only one feeling like that. In fact, i think that most people have those feelings, but they're just better at hiding them. I guess practice makes perfect, and i for sure didn't have much practice when it comes to talking with groups of friends/people irl, or just people in general. Socializing and communication are things are also just things that we can learn.

After hundreds of hours of thinking about those topics, i believe (and got told by my friend) the following: You deserve to be loved. And people will love you. But pretty much a precondition to that is that you love yourself, and that's what i and you (and as i assume from your text) have to work on. I just saw a post a few days back which was called ""how to practice self care/love"". And it basically said: tell it to yourself. Go to a fckin mirror and say to yourself that you love yourself. Meanwhile, take care of yourself. Don't overly drink or eat, don't take drugs, go to the doctor every few years. Do stuff that you consider fun in your free time. Take time to chill, don't just do something in every minute of your day. Start a practice like meditation (there's also stuff like self-love meditation, can only recommend). 

So basically: Take care of your body, but equally important if not more take care of your mental health. And i feel like that's what people forget way too often. We tend to get mad at oneself and basically be our worst enemy. Just consider yourself like a good friend. Would you tell your friend that he's garbage and doesn't deserve love? Probably not. Just give yourself the advice that you'd give your best friend if he was in the same situation as you are.

Pretty much since his rework, he was always at least some kind of viable. GP has the possibility to fight bruisers, GP has the ability to fight tanks. And if he loses this ability due to being ganked and getting bent over in lane, he can still farm up and be useful lategame.

However: while all of this is true, there are also other champions. Champs like Kled, like Mordekaiser. Champs like these aren't only good champs, it's unbelievable how good they are. I don't think that they're even comparable to GP on that level. Small example: GPs ult got basically nerfed when they removed thunderlords. Meanwhile, Morde Ult can just remove 1 champ basically completely from the game. Is that comparable? Not really. GPs ult was pretty much the only one that could instantly damage you from over the whole map. Now look at champs like Senna, that basically deal the whole dmg of GP ult after a small charge, while even shielding their allies. And that as a support.

GP with grasp may be obnoxious to deal with. But there are like 20 better options top that are even more obnoxious.

&#x200B;

I just feel like there's always a better alternative atm that just does more damage, has more impact, and doesn't require you to outplay your opponent or hit your barrels while even being much tankier than GP.

Is he viable? Can you climb with him? Sure. Is he good compared to other toplaners? Questionable. Is he good if you take into account that toplane basically got nerfed hard this patch, GP is a scaling champ and you need to get drakes early since at the 5th lost drake the game is basically over? Nope, he isn't good at all. I doubt we'll see a lot of GP mains in Challenger this season, at least compared to some of those other options top, that just either are worse to deal with mid to lategame or that just snowball early.

Jaxmains,fe8biow,t3_enxxih,1578924515.0,"First of all: if you can't kill your laner or don't try to make your enemy low for a gank, you shouldn't trade at all, since that just make you vulnerable for ganks and makes you indeed lose prio. Especially on champions like Jax that will usually not kill their lane opponent if he doesn't fck up hard. Depending on your elo, i'd just trade a little bit to see if i have kill potential (even more so since your lvl 1 and lvl 2 spike is pretty strong if you have push advantage), but otherwise just stay clean of trades until i have at least 2-3 items or my lvl 6 spike to get an all in potential.

Otherwise, there isn't much advice to give. Get the plants if you get poked down too low (often only possible when pushing, which means that you already had prio ...), take TP and reset when you run out of pots and get low.

Playing Jax is mostly about toplane knowledge, imo. You can't go for every CS or you will get poked down and lose out in the long run. Use your E to secure cannon minions while not taking too much damage and try to just survive until you have items. When your jungler decides to do stuff around top, hold onto your E and/or try to bait your laner in, depending on the situation. You mostly won't have prio unless you are able to repeatedly jump onto your laner and/or poke him out, but you have a great gank setup. Ask your jungler to gank first before demanding any kind of pressure or participation in the game from you.

&#x200B;

Also: Conq isn't good every time. I personally also like to go for fleet when i feel like it. A must vs champs like Ryze, imo, if you want to survive laning phase and not get outfarmed super hard.

If you want to know how to position yourself and play Jax vs ranged champs in general, i can only recommend the ex-pro-player Wickd. Just watch his recent video on youtube as Jax vs Lucian and you'll learn a lot."

Now imagine that + a botlane that goes 0-20 every game and you have a description of my recent ranked games this season."
socialskills,fe6dwgg,t1_fe5d5zt,1578888043.0,"I agree with everything here but the end statement. I'd rather say:

Don't chase other people. Chase a hobby or activity and take the friends that you get on that path."
summonerschool,fe5xdw6,t1_fe31fe0,1578877067.0,"it's also a plat ish tip. and a diamond ish tip. going for the wrong objectives is just happening way too often. i've just played my placement games and had like 4 out of those 10 games thrown away because my team wanted to group on the lane on which we already had an inhibitor down, while we had baron and could've just splitpushed the other lanes. and those people made it into high plat/low diamond. that's just embarrasing. i felt like i was playing my placements in the actual elo in that you start (high silver/low gold).

&#x200B;

also another problem related to ""In silver people listen to baron calls"": people don't listen. like ever. small example: i play jax, and am laning vs an aatrox. we're both lvl 5. he has ignite and a small item lead because he already reset, i'm at full hp. a huge minion wave of 15 minions is pushing into my tower. the jungler (shaco) pings that he'll gank my lane now. i ping him back. he still goes in (is in the middle of 15 minions and close to an aatrox with ignite). because i don't want to let him die, i go in as well, tank the minions with my e and stun aatrox. we burst aatrox down to like 100 hp. shaco leaves me alone with aatrox as he's quite low and wants to somehow give me the kill (a jax without items or any kind of burst like the passive lvl 6 autos). i die. shaco reengages and gets the flash from aatrox. i successfully lost 15 minions of xp and gold (shaco got like half of them at least), and fed a kill to my now snowballing laner.

another related situation from last season: we play against a rumble. i play renekton and am like 3-0 after the laning phase (irrelevant for the argument. thing to understand: he's very good in teamfights and can fck us over when we position wrong). the enemy rumble engages in small skirmishes and later on teamfights, that we for whatever reason fight in the jungle. we lose those fights multiple times. i tell them multiple times to not fight in the jungle. because i don't want them to die for no reason, so i follow up even though their calls are shit. i still tell them after every lost fight that we shouldn't do this and that we'll lose if we continue to fight in the jungle. after 20 minutes of losing, i'm 4-8 stats because of teamcalls. in the endscreen of our exploding nexus, i type ""we shouldn't have taken these fights. pls remember for the next game: don't fight a rumble (and they also had j4 and stuff like that) in the jungle"". what do i get as an answer? ""4-8 don't talk.""

what i learnt from this: first of all, use the mute function. it's in the game for a reason. second: don't follow bad calls. following them just encourages your team to continue to follow through with those bad calls.

overall: just focus on your own gameplay. in the long run, this means that you'll sooner or later get to the rank that you deserve. try to stay calm, don't tilt your team, don't tilt yourself, don't try to teach your team how to play in a single 30 minute game beyond making like 3-4 good calls like ""baron"" or ""let me split and push when i pull them to me""."
summonerschool,fe3utd6,t1_fe0l27v,1578853112.0,"played with my pinky on q my whole life, never had a problem with it. when i have to look up the range indicator on something, i just use my pinky for shift while switching with my ring finger to q. also, i use a to attackmove everytime i auto, also with my pinky. don't realize why this should be a problem. the amount of games that i get problems because of that is maybe at maximum 1 out of like 500 games.

how do you use your number keys then for items and so on? like how do you press 7? when playing support and you have like 4-5 items with actives, i don't feel like i could reach those numbers in this scenario."
summonerschool,fe2uwjo,t1_fe2s10o,1578843092.0,"that's just a person that didn't understand the second rule though. why should you gank a lane in that you'll just both die with a good chance, or in that you'll definitely die if the enemy counterganks. why shouldn't you gank the lane that is already ahead and make sure that they won't throw their lead, but instead make their lead bigger and make it snowball to other lanes as well? it's hard to kill a fed laner in lane, it's much easier to kill him later on with the other lanes that you fed previously."
summonerschool,fe2txut,t1_fe0cc66,1578842777.0,"also: focusing on stuff like baron or drake when you could just end. finding the right situations in that you can just end is important to close out games often enough. when the enemies are like 20 seconds dead and you're pushing the inhib, it often depends on the comb how fast you can end. you have a jinx/tristana/ziggs? you won't even need 15 seconds for the nexus."
IWantToLearn,fdzmgwf,t1_fdz4ot9,1578791706.0,"Also consider the following: while some people are in general givers, some others are just more takers. It may not be directly related to yourself or your actions. I have friends who i'd consider equally good friends, and some give many things, while others don't give at all. It might not only be your fault.

However: if you feel like they're much more outgoing with others, much more giving to others or much happier with others, then you might wanna rethink if they're actually your friends. If they say to you that they have other plans, they might also just be busy, it happens often enough. I often enough said that i am busy and don't want to go out today anymore.

Imo it all depends on what kind of feeling they give you when you're around them. Who cares if they are your best friends or not, or if they're givers or takers. If you're happy when you are around them, and they're happy when they're around you, then what's the problem? Self doubt can really destroy these kind of relationships. None of you has made some kind of contract that makes them have to commit to this friendship. The other person in fact owes you nothing, even if you saved his/her life or whatever. 

The only question you should be asking yourself is: ""are you happy around them?"" If yes: call them, and consider them your friends. If not: don't call them. It's literally that simple, even though our brain makes it very hard to grasp this, often enough. Self doubt and problems with self esteem often manifest in this friendship destroying way, where you finally doubt that anyone could even like yourself, because you hate yourself so much (which leads into a circle). You have to break through this habit and stop self doubting yourself when it comes to people. 

And let's watch this from the other perspective: if they don't want to hang out with you, this could have many reasons. One of these reasons may be that they don't like you. Another is that they're just really busy and have other things to do. Fact is: they aren't around in those situations in that they don't hang out with you for some reason. So to make it easy: search new acquaintances in this time and find new friends or people to hang out with. This way you can either basically replace bad friendships (which then will lead into them not calling you, and you just hanging out with your new people), or worst case: you still find new people. Ok, the absolute worst case is that they're also ""bad friends"", but that would just give you more examples of situations that you might have to work on and of behaviors that you could improve on. It's a win win in the end.

&#x200B;

Imo, just having a few people as friends is a very bad thing. It makes you very reliant on these people and means that you'll probably start doubting yourself as soon as it doesn't work out as before with them anymore for whatever reason. Putting yourself out there and just getting to know new people every day is the only real solution in my eyes."
IWantToLearn,fdziul5,t1_fdz0s3e,1578790592.0,"""Typically friends would think of you most times for most things. Non-friends dont.""

Imo it isn't so black and white like that. I have a few friends that i see every week and we'd help each other out as good as we can. But ""thinking of you most of the times"" isn't something that i'd consider something that they'd do for me or i'd do for them. When we're around or something nice happens around us, sure. But when there's something else going on in our lives or we're getting hold up in life with work and things like that, we won't just think about the other person whole day long. We won't message us how it's going or what's up, unless there's a particular reason to do so or someone wants to plan some kind of meetup or something like that. But when there's opportunities to get together, we'll do so. Not when we're around other friendgroups either, but just when we're doing together the same kind of stuff we're always doing together. Like with one friendgroup, you'll always go to the cinema and eat afterwards. With the others, you'll do sports weekly. With others again, you'll just meet up at home and do nothing all day long. With others, you'll go clubbing. When we're doing those kind of things, we're thinking of those particular groups/people that we're around. But in other situations? Nope, not really happening (unless there's some kind of intention involved to make it more than a friendship).

I know you wrote ""typically"", but i just wanted to make your statement a little more precise and not that general."
IWantToLearn,fdrnifu,t3_emsrho,1578687003.0,"the funny thing is: noone really knows how to socialize. noone really knows what they're doing. imagine it like that: when you talk to strangers, it's always a gamble. of course the results depend on your impression that you're going to leave them with, but you just can't control other people.

this might sound strange, but here's a little challenge for you: just socialize, even though you don't know what you're doing. you can just see it like a small survey that tells you how to behave around people so that they'll see you as nice. you'll meet nice people, you'll meet not so nice ones. you'll mess it up often enough, but you're going to get better and better. you can read thousands of books and watch thousands of videos on that topic, but the gist of all of them basically is: just try to treat people like you would want to be treated, and you'll be fine in the end.

&#x200B;

so step 1: you won't meet people on your couch or at home. get out there. doesn't matter where or when or for what. there are people? then go there. nightclubs, bars, dancing, sports, cooking. whatever activity there is -> go there.

step 2: talk to them. a lot. just talk to them and listen to them, since those are the two big steps of a conversation. ask them about their lives, their activities, their families, and try to dig deeper like ""why do you do XYZ?"". after a bit of time, you can also ask them about how they felt when it comes to those activities. stuff like this will also show you if you go into the right direction and will show that you're rather interested in the person than just the activity or sth more shallow.

general rules of thumb:

* the conversation should be like 50/50 split between them and you
* try to ask/tell them stuff but then also follow up with your own stories/question to that. don't just swap the topic randomly, as it makes you appear as if you're not interested in the topic really, but rather in just talking words (which can be taken basically like a personal insult). around 50/50 asking questions and telling stories should be fine
* just follow your feelings. if you feel like someone likes that you're around, and you like being around them, too, just follow through with it. if you feel like you can make some small jokes with someone, do it. just try to find your limits and the limits of people (without going super over the top of course. take small and simple steps to figure out the borders of what a person likes and what not).

&#x200B;

and i'm sure that if you think about this stuff yourself, you'd come to (more or less) the same conclusions on how people behave and what you should do to meet people. approaching someone randomly requires courage, but courage can be faked. fake it till you make it isn't just a useless phrase. it's exactly that: doing it without confidence until you can do it good enough that you develop this confidence.

so good luck from my side. if you have any questions, feel free to ask. just keep in mind that i'm just a normal person like you. everything i know is something you could've gotten to know yourself as well."
socialskills,fdqz725,t1_fdqqs6x,1578677209.0,">Some people just want to be left alone.

while that is true, it's still rather hard to figure out what kind of person you have in front of you. are you just supposed not to talk to anyone anymore because a few people want to be left alone? you don't owe a stranger anything and i am the last one who wants you to throw away your plans for the day. but am i asking for too much if i ask people to be nice, also when rejecting someone? you don't know them, you don't know how their day was or what is happening in their lives. same the other way around. so it would be understandable if people are stressed and annoyed by whatever, but am i really asking for too much if i want people to be nice to each other even in those situations, myself included?

you don't owe me to talk to me further than ""sry, i don't know you, but i don't want to talk to strangers right now"" or sth like that if you are not in the mood to talk. that's something that i could understand. but being just outright rude, insulting me or my friendly and/or rather shy actions is just not something that i could understand. even if you have a bad day, even if you get talked to by creeps all day long and don't want to take your chances with me.

people get downvoted all the time for making jokes that others don't like or don't understand, just as people are going to be toxic in competitive games. imo though, in case of the game it just shows the value of the game. their rank is important to them and when they have the feeling that others don't try to win and just want to bring them down, they get tilted. that's a totally human reaction. as soon as you realize this (and also discover the ""/mute all""-function), you can actually start having fun in the game.

let's say it like that: i doubt any of the 10 players in each game just queue up to int, flame and blame others. 10 of them usually try to have fun. as long as you just mute the toxic people or actually just mute all, you can actually play this game quite well without feeling worse/bad afterwards imo."
