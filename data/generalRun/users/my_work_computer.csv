Foodforthought,fef5la8,t1_fef3qr9,1579048716.0,"I may be under a completely different mindset, but developing systems and requirements that allow people to eat, live, feel heard and feel valued that continues to incrementally progress our society seems to be pretty humane."
Foodforthought,fef4ken,t1_fef3452,1579048025.0,"Absolutely not.  I'm hoping to look for discussion, not assert right and wrong.

How can we structure a system away from that?  
Can we look to spend some of the administrative and bureaucratic cost currently into developing systems for service and success?  Develop programs that involve helping our neighbor or subsidized educational programs to help sustain one's self or community?"
Foodforthought,fef36ge,t1_fef1otm,1579047092.0,"While I agree that UBI is inevitable, there is more than likely, quite a span of time between now and then - depending on the economist you listen to.

You understand that having people bought in vs forced into compliance with a policy is much more valuable.  Simply ramming a UBI down voters throats is a terrible way to be reelected and ensure continued compliance.  It seems making the bulk of people feel as if they were heard and valued, and finding a win win may be a better progression for society than telling each other we are wrong.

There is also a truly morbid reality that UBI doesn't occur, and the rich continue to thrive, the powers at be ""take care of"" poverty and society continues without the underclass."
Foodforthought,fef1b79,t1_feexzpe,1579045839.0,"People are doing exactly that.  By no means everyone nor the majority, but even those with full time jobs can find often find time to volunteer.  Your blanket statement is just as worthless as those claiming everyone is 

The issue with requiring employment is that it requires compatible and desirable skills - which you state they do not have - and economic need - which the depressed areas may not have.  

I do not assume it is a good life by any means, so please don't assume that of me.  All that I would like to see is people provide a benefit to the greater society in order to be provided a benefit from the greater society.  

This may result in a different type of/look at what volunteering/civil service may be.  

It was a question to open a discussion, thank you for your input."
Foodforthought,feew503,t3_eoozlp,1579042497.0,Would a requirement to work OR volunteer make a difference?
Waterfowl,fe8qpvm,t1_fe8n3ib,1578929458.0,What most refer to as a lesser Canada is actually a cackling goose.  Easiest way to tell year round is the shape of the bill.  These hold a much steeper bill resembling a snow or speck bill where the true Canada is more swooping.

Once the leather is wet, the waterproof liner will still function but the moist warm air inside the boot causes condensation at the boundary to the cold outside air."
SelfSufficiency,fdioe1i,t1_fdhcxvk,1578447416.0,"As much as I would like to agree, the science behind a grass crop actually shows to be carbon negative, even with mowing.  Grass is naturally fast growing and pulls in a ton of carbon.  It is nice to see it grown and bailed as livestock feed vs just mowed."
