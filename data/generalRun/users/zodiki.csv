gadgets,fcv4krf,t3_eiz493,1577994519.0,That may be one of the most ridiculous ideas I have read. People who spend that much on a gaming PC don’t want one they can’t customize and overclock and do all kinds of things that would destroy an Apple TOS.
television,fcn8vwc,t3_ehze8y,1577806276.0,"People should ignore reviews in general unless they trust the source. Review aggregation sites like Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic should especially be ignored. Pick any popular show or movie and read the reviews. It's glaringly obvious how so many of them are clearly biased.

Consumers would best be served by either not listening at all to critics or by finding some critics that through time seem to have similar tastes to you own and can be trusted. However in this day of media and marketing manipulation, it would be better to always make your own judgments. 

I would also ask that if you are to share your judgments with others that you make a cogent argument without over-sensationalizing  - we have enough clickbaits and trolls as it is.

As for my review of the Witcher, I thought it had some really good parts and consider it a decent first season and worthy of further exploration. I would recommend it to anyone who likes sword and sorcery shows and movies. It's not early season GoT quality but the two source materials are very different. Also there was never a gaming fanbase for GoT. The Witcher has a very difficult row to hoe navigating rabid fan bases as well as the general resentment of the anti-fan bases who seem to hate anything popular or successful."
