todayilearned,fgqmsfx,t1_fgotinw,1581027203.0,"Nah see, Forrest Gump was only *acting* like he was mentally disabled. He was secretly behind the scenes of everything in the film and carefully manipulated the events he was a part of to make it appear as though he wasn't really there. This is why all of the real footage we have of the events in the movie don't depict him when he clearly was there. Why, you may ask? Well Forrest Gump is actually a Sith Lord. Darth Gump uses his innocence and perceived lack of intelligence to slip into unsuspecting groups and rally them for his own purpose, which is ultimately getting Palpatine on the throne and turning Anakin to the dark side."

Or maybe it means that the number of players they interact with personally doesn't shift that significantly, be it 6 person matches or 60 person matches. In battlefield games for example even though there are 10 times the players you aren't going to personally interact with every single one, and if you do many of them will only be for a few seconds to minutes out of matches that can easily last an hour or longer. In this case it is pretty much impossible to find the trolls that don't go after you specifically, so you're going to personally experience about the same level of trolling as you would in a smaller match."
