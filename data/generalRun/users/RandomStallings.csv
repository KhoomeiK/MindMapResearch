tressless,ff9nrp3,t3_esbkm2,1579716853.0,"Any time you increase the amount of cell division in your body you're increasing your risk of cancer. A person with greater body mass than another TECHNICALLY is at a higher risk of cancer simply because of this. However, I would say that you'd need some serious long term studies to see if this is even a real risk. My guess, for the nothing that it's worth, is that this is of no real concern. I'd be more concerned about the rest of the stuff you put on your head. More importantly, avoid sunburns. I've seen a thousand sunburnt scalps. That definitely raises your cancer risk.

Edit: you clearly know to avoid sunburns. Anyone does. The point is that cancer from microneedling is absolutely nothing to worry about. Other things are."
