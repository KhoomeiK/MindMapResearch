People have reported that family members who died of respiratory symptoms without tests for the virus (either because they died at home or died in hospitals that lacked sufficient testing supplies) have been shipped to crematoriums by people in hazmat suits and immediately cremated. Theoretically a good way to prevent further spread, but without adequate testing there's no way to know the true extent and lethality of the disease."
SubredditDrama,ffiebsu,t1_ffhxs75,1579971829.0,"Idk, it can be hard when you meet some of these people in real life and realize how they've basically been brainwashed their entire life to accept that they are ""just naturally inferior"". To continue the analogy, they can see that movement over there to not give women shit sandwiches, and on a deep level they yearn for it, but they have been ground into the dust their entire lives being told that not giving women shit sandwiches is completely evil. So the best their conscious mind can do in the social groups they move in is asking that maybe the shit sandwiches have a little less shit on them."
bestoflegaladvice,fff3fkp,t1_ffeo158,1579874662.0,"For cats actually there's no real negatives to the early spay/neuter. They recover faster with fewer complications, require less pain medication, etc. From seeing it myself, kittens fixed 6-8 weeks spring back noticeably faster than the adults or even kittens over 16 weeks. The vets grumble a little when they get a particularly tiny girl for spay with little fiddly anatomy, but they grumble a lot more when they gotta deal with the blood supply in an adult close to heat."
bestoflegaladvice,ffe9fho,t1_ffe8z22,1579840354.0,"The adoption fee is usually a way to weed out people who would otherwise impulsively adopt an animal, and then have no money to feed it, or worse. Usually an animal costs the shelter $150+ in housing, spay, and shots before adoption, the adoption fee is usually a lot lower than that ($0-$100). Young puppies are typically the exception though - young puppies are what everyone wants, so you can charge $300+ which can be a small profit on that particular animal, which helps pay for care for the other animals."

worldnews,fey5j2i,t1_fexvufg,1579441070.0,">Why should anyone get a ""free"" brand new safe home to replace their illegally built structure?

This is amazingly short-sighted, and one of the things wrong with a lot of current policy. Just because something doesn't ""feel fair"" to you does not make it a bad option. If you want to play it that way, *purely economically*, it benefits the state to keep people in homes. Leaving people on the street without modern amenities increases disease, crime, food wastage, prevents kids from getting an education, etc. These all cost the government significant amounts of money in both tax money and lost potential. Giving them homes to go back to at night will drastically improve quality of life and likely save money in the long run for EVERYONE, not just the people whose homes have been rebuilt. And since we can comfortably assume future disasters will take place on the island, building houses to a strict building code ensures that unless the damage is much more severe during future events, fewer homes will completely fall down, saving both lives and rebuilding costs in the future."

bestoflegaladvice,fegojvl,t1_fegjttj,1579098788.0,"She's 20 and they say the situation started 3 years ago, so she was not in fact a ""grown-ass adult"" when this thing all started and honestly it sounds like it's a frog in boiling water situation where it seemed ok at first (teacher helping a kid in a really bad family situation) and then one day she woke up and looked around and went ""wait wtf"". Not to mention, imagine growing up in that house under that mother. Her normal meter was probably not tuned right to begin with, and continuing to live under that roof as a young adult isn't exactly conducive to learning what's normal. 

Also, it sounds like rather than being ""jealous"", it was legitimate concerns for her safety that are prompting her to realize things aren't right. It's not jealousy when you're concerned about someone choosing an unstable kid with a gun over their own kid's safety."
aww,fefythy,t1_fef7q0w,1579069861.0,"Why is that weird to say about a cat? Despite popular opinion casting them as something evil and unloving (which imo is caused by people getting cats, thinking ""they don't need attention like dogs"", and then neglecting them making what is basically the cat version of a feral child), they are thinking feeling animals just like us. My cat, even as a kitten, never bothered my hair dye or knitting, two things I consider very important to me, and that's just one way that we're together on the same wavelength and that's not weird that's just fact"
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fedmp1h,t1_fed8bi0,1579015278.0,"Tbh from what I've read Freud in his very early days had some incredibly good ideas and insight. The most important was the ""childhood seduction hypothesis"" where he actually LISTENED to his (mostly female) patients and BELIEVED them when they said they had been sexually abused during childhood, and this was the root cause of a lot of their adult dysfunction. Of course nobody could accept this because that would mean sexual abuse of children was horrifying common...And as he grew older (and was a part of some really fucked up experimental surgery) he abandoned his theory and adopted that of the mainstream, that these women were all just silly fantasists who makebelieved that their father sexually assaulted them for half their childhood"

Free radicals are atoms with unpaired electrons, most usually in the body used to refer to reactive oxygen species that, as the name implies, are highly reactive with proteins, DNA, and other body components and capable of damaging them, which can *lead* to cancer, but in no way does the term refer to precancerous cells."
AskReddit,fe3tc0g,t1_fe1xxvg,1578852674.0,"This already happens - your immune system already kills potentially cancerous cells every single day. What we call ""cancer"" is when those precancerous cells manage to pretend to be regular cells well enough that the immune system doesn't notice them and allows them to remain and multiply. Sometimes the immune system realizes a little bit late that those cells are fucky and goes to war on them - this is what we call spontaneous remission. So really this treatment is nothing more than induced spontaneous remission. Non-spontaneous remission? Anyway it's cool and revolutionary in regards to treatment but it's nothing new in terms of a lucky person's body's capabilities."

Like the whole story, even the excellent beginning, is just not worth the effort now since the ending doesn't close the storyline in a remotely satisfying way whatsoever.

I think with things like star wars though, where you're talking about different stories in the same universe vastly separated in time, one should be able to independently enjoy or not enjoy each on their own merits. Like we all willingly accept that the third Iron Man was trash but that didn't ruin my enjoyment of Antman or Endgame."

But, as it currently stands, the USA already pays the same or more *taxpayer* dollars on healthcare than countries with socialized medicine, and then private citizens pay even more on top of that. The USA system is uniquely set up to be ludicrously expensive by pushing people away from cheap preventative medicine until they have no choice but to pursue expensive end-stage options. It would be essentially impossible to end up paying more in the long run under any other system."
