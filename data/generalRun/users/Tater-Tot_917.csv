Oh no, her friend gave her a gift that, in your eyes, was too expensive. How dare she. Clearly this is going to completely destroy her concept of the value of money. Smh.

C'mon OP, you could have used this as an opportunity to teach her about hratotude, being grateful for the gifts you get, etc. Instead you turn it into this. You really think this is gonna teach her the value of anything other than ""my mom doesnt think I deserve nicer more expensive things""?

Also, delicate? A fucking scarf? Delicate? To the point where you cant trust your teenage daughter to care for it? What the fuck?

OP you need to get over yourself and stop punishing your daughter because of your own insecurities. Your daughter's 13, you should not under any circumstances be forcing her to give back a gift, especially when its something as simple as a scarf, just because *you* think its 'too expensive' or 'not appropriate' because lets be real, it doesnt matter what you think. It was not your scarf to give or recieve therfore you have no say in this. If she wants to gift her friend a scarf that is her decision, not yours. Also, once again, *its a scarf. Its not nearly as big of a deal as youre making it out to be*."

>You marry someone old enough to be your father dont be suprised if he treats you like his daughter.

I don't know what kind of father/daughter relationships youve seen but typically, demanding your daughter hand over her money to you for your own selfish reasons is seen as abusive, or at the very least shitty/trashy behavior.

>Maybe the now ex-husband flexed a little financial muscle...

Lmao, if that was the case he wouldn't be demanding money from her to help his daughter, he'd just help her his own damn self.

>and this was the red flag that the man she married for his assets wasnt going to be a push over down the line

Oorr this was a red flag that hes a greedy, selfish, insensitive asshole with a daughter whos just like him and she'd be better off without the both of them. And again, if he had any assets to speak of he wouldn't be demanding **her money**.

>Most people can't afford to just give 15k to charity and wouldn't even consider it unless they were already very financially secure

Two problems with this statement. First, shes not just giving 15k to charity. Shes donating the money that her, her daughters father, and her daughter have been saving for years. Second, it doesnt matter if she's financially secure or not. Shes donating her daughters college fund in her daughters honor after she died.

>The fact that she was willing to get a divorce over this is sketchy.

The fact that shes willing to divorce a guy for trying to take her half of her dead daughters college fund for his own daughter is sketchy to you? I dont even have the words to describe how asinine that sounds.

>There's more to this story tbh.

No. Theres not. You're just an incel wannabe trying to take this story and twist it around to make her look bad because in your own little world theres noooo way that the man is in the wrong! No, its got to be the woman whos bad because of course she only married him for money! It doesnt matter to you that **he is the one demanding her money**. Nope. Shes a golddigger who married him for his money and is now divorcing him because, somefuckinghow, him demanding she give up her half of her dead daughters college fund to his daughter means he wont be a push over in the future, whatever the hell thats supposed to mean.

Not because you want to, but because you want to do it behind his back and lie to him about it. Thats not okay OP. Hes the father, he should have just as much of a say in this as you do.

Talk to your doctor, have him talk to your doctor, go to a therapist, *just dont go behind his back like that and lie to him*

Plus, unless hes an idiot, Im sure he'd put two and two together and figure out what you did. Maybe not immediately but eventually he will. Imagine how much that would destory him. To mourn the loss of two of y'alls babies only to find out you went against his wishes, behind his back, and then lied to him about it...

I know that making a decision like that can be heart breaking, even if its for the best, but its not something you should do behind his back. Y'all need to figure this out **together**.

Someone talks to him and helps him understand that this behavior isnt okay, that he deserves better, that kind of thing and it helps him grow strong enough to end it. Doesnt matter if that person happens to be someone that she cheated on him with. He thought she was single, hes used to her crap, they talk it out like adults and he decides to help him.

As for those of you saying if your husband did this it would 'leave a huge scar on the relationship' im pretty sure forbidding your husband from going to a loved ones funeral, especially a loved one as close as a twin sibling, just because theres a chance something will happen while hes away would leave a much bigger scar on a relationship.

This should not be his wifes decision to make for him. He lost his twin sister, he has every right to go to her funeral. Idgaf if you disagree with me, I would **never** forbid my Fiance from anything, much less going to a loved ones funeral just because something might happen while he's away.

Yes, he needs to be there for his wife. Yes, childbirth can be a tough thing to go through. Im not disagreeing with any of that. Im just saying that OP lost someone who he was clearly very close to and it doesnt look like hes getting any kind of support from his wife while hes grieving, and hes got a bunch of people on reddit telling him hed be an asshole if he went to his sisters funeral just because its a few days before his wifes due date and something might happen while hes away...

That kind of logic absolutely blows my mind. I could not imagine telling my Fiance hes not allowed to go to a loved ones funeral, telling him that if he did so it would 'leave a scar on the relationship', or any of the other things Ive seen in the comments. What bothers me the most is that on any other post where a woman says her husband/boyfriend forbade her from doing something everyone blows up saying 'he has no right to tell you what you can and cant do' etc etc. But when a man says his wife forbade him from going to his sisters funeral everyone agrees hed be an asshole just because shes pregnant and something might happen in the one day that hes gone???

I really dont understand Reddit logic sometimes, and it breaks my heart that OP is not only dealing with the loss of someone close to him but also being called a potential asshole for wanting to say one final goodbye...

No?

Abusive background or not, asking someone to alter their look to such a degree (shaving or dheing hair) is absurd.

Because plenty of people in my life have had babies and never once has any of them said a single thing about massaging their babys nails off.

Just because I haven't personally had a baby doesnt mean Im uninformed or know nothing about them. I still know people who have had babies and again, none of them have ever said or done anything like what you're saying. They all trim(ed) their babies nails with clippers.

I think its best if you and your gf break up.

I also think its best if you find yourself a good therapist. Im not saying that to be mean, Im saying that because from what I saw it looks like you genuinely want to be a better person and random strangers on reddit wont get you there. From someone whos been through something similar before, please cut the relationship loose and seek some help. It will be better and healthier for the both of you.

You said in your post last week that y'all genuinely love eachother, but the relationship is toxic and abusive. **Break it off, work on yourself, get yourself to a happier and healthier state of mind, then see about trying again.**

If it goes down the same path, y'all werent meant to be. If it doesnt, y'all can be together in a much happier and healthier environment."
relationship_advice,fg2lhdi,t3_ewbhs0,1580447408.0,"You need to sit down and have an open and serious talk with her.

Tell her that the way shes been talking is worrying you and if she wants to get out there and explore with other people thats her decision, but you will not be a part of it.

Make sure you tell her you love her, you care about her, and you want to be with her, but you are not okay with what her coworkers are encouraging her to do.

Try not to sound accusatory, just make it clear that you know your worth and will not tolerate being cheated on just because she feels like she missed out on a part of her life. Shes a mother ffs. She needs to think about what kind of example she would be setting for her children were she to cheat on you for such an asinine reason.

Theres nothing wrong with feeling like you missed out on sonething, but to 'joke' about doing something that would not only destroy her marriage but hurt the one shes married to is just..absurd and selfish. She knew the commitment she would be making when she married you.

Not only do her coworkers sound like toxic ass people, but they sound like they're jealous of y'alls marriage and are trying to convince her to leave you because of that. Like they say, misery loves company. Im afraid theyre trying to drag your wife down to their level by convincing her shes missed out on something (she hasnt). Her coworkers do not sound like good people. Good people wouldnt try to tear apart a (presumably) happy and healthy marriage by trying to convince one of them that they 'missed out on a part of their life' by not sleeping around, partying, etc.

Thats probably all you can do at this point that doesnt involve leaving...talk to her. Tell her you trust her but the way shes been talking is starting to worry you. You'll be able to tell based on how she reacts if shes really 'just joking' or not.

Best of luck OP. Whatever method you choose, I hope it goes well..."

I'll admit that I cried like a baby when I lost my guinea pigs, when I found my dog dead from being run over, and when any other pet of mine died BUT it is different than a child. You kinda expect your pet to die before you, you never expect to have to bury your child. You both lost your temper and thats understandable.

Also, yea you've had years to process the loss of your child but that doesnt mean youre not still allowed to be hurt by it. Thats a kind of pain that never goes away.

As for your last edit, I personally dont think that makes you TA. Yea I think you shouldnt have exaggerated the details that much, but I understand you wanting to protect your privacy. It doesnt matter that your son was less than a year anf her dog was sixteen years, he was still your son.
