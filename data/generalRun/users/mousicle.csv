NoStupidQuestions,ffcarf1,t3_esuw0x,1579795391.0,"Lets take your questions one by one

What does that mean?  I think its pretty straight forward the US owes 23 Trillion dollars it needs to pay back.

Who do we owe?  So the US debt takes the form of Treasury Bonds.  The same bonds you can buy and give your nephew for christmas.  Who owns those bonds? 32.5% is owned by Normal Americans, 29.3% is owned by foreign investors that could be regular folk or governments like China, 38.2% is owned by the government itself, mostly borrowing money from social security.

Why is it only ever increasing it seems? So the thing about Treasury Bonds is they are so trusted that they pay a really low interest rate, lower then the rate of inflation.  That essentially means the US doesn't really pay interest on those bonds so there isn't a reason to not issue more of them.  On top of that no polititican wants to cut enough programs and spending or raise taxes to get the National Budget into a surplus position to pay down the principal.

Why does it even matter when the government keeps creating new programs that cost more money? The reason it matters is if they just go nuts with increasing the debt they'll reach a point where they can't afford to keep paying all those treasury bonds without just printing money which devalues the dollar.  It is incredibly damaging to the US economy to default on bonds or devalue the dollar so they need to at least keep the growth under control.

 It seems that they can just keep increasing the debt without bound and repercussion, yet is only brought up for convenience by either political party during debates.  They can't increase without bound as my last point alludes to but its a great political tool because most people don't understand how the wealth of nations works so they think the US debt is like personal debt which makes for easy scare mongering or making people think it jsut doesn't matter at all."

It took almost all the stations computer memory to store the patterns of like 6 people.  So you'd need a giant transmitter and a giant computer core to store all that data before reforming it as it's coming in.  We know a transporter buffer can obviously do it but we don't know how well a transporter buffer works with exported data.  We know you can use exported data to at least alter an existing pattern as seen in Rascals.  But the only time we've ever seen transporter data stored and used later is on DS9 and that didn't go through a transmitting process.
