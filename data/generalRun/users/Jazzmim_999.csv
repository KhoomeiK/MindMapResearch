“Technically, people can get pregnant at any time during their menstrual cycle, though it is much less likely during their period.

A person is most likely to get pregnant in the middle of their menstrual cycle. This phase is called the fertile window.

The chances of becoming pregnant are much lower before and after the fertile window, **but it is still possible**, and there are several factors to consider.”
