Showerthoughts,ff4k3gp,t1_ff364wt,1579565529.0,Irish accents are regularly voted one of the sexiest accents. Obviously it depends on which part of Ireland but there are large numbers of people who find Irish accents attractive.
Showerthoughts,ff4jtr2,t3_ercjy4,1579565342.0,"Definitely a familiarity factor but not just our own. I've lived in the UK for over 3 years (originally from Australia). Used to *love* English accents, like almost drool worthy. Now I find them alright but definitely not on that level. It's a novelty factor, those things that are unfamiliar are exotic and alluring, the everyday is just a little boring."

AmItheAsshole,fdwrhhb,t3_en7m4b,1578761635.0,YTA. Validation post. No other reason to ask if you're an ass for offering someone help.
AmItheAsshole,fdwpm9m,t1_fdwot4y,1578761155.0,"You're right about the last bit. Exactly like in that case, its nice to help but you don't have to help. But you're making it her responsibility to look after your mum.

To clarify, that might have been what your daughter wanted for her but that isn't necessarily what the roommate thought it meant. If I were in the roommates position I would take it to mean that I had to listen out for the moans, that I was now responsible."
AmItheAsshole,fdwlx4g,t3_en894e,1578760040.0,"ESH. I get your mum is in pain but it isn't up to her roommate to manage her treatment. For you it sounds like a simple request but it means her roommate has to play close attention to your mum. She has to determine is your mum moaning because of pain or has she just moved, etc. Yes she should be considerate, it isn't her job to do. And don't be so petty, is someone needs help, you should give it to them regards of what they have done."
AmItheAsshole,fdwkf6y,t3_en8fu3,1578759635.0,YTA. I get not wanting drama but you're supporting Sam over Molly when honestly it sounds like Sam is the one who is making the drama. He forcibly tried to kiss her and you're worried about his anger issues but she is the one who isn't allowed to return to the group chat or be invited because of drama. Sounds like she is better off without you guys.
AmItheAsshole,fdwjcn3,t3_en7hby,1578759279.0,"YTA. Imagine being so entitled that you threaten someone with legal action over a flat tire. Get over yourself. It was a perk, you got an hour of fun and then poor luck got in the way. But you could have very easily fixed it without hassle but you made a drama out of nothing."
AmItheAsshole,fdwj2xf,t1_fdvrrq6,1578759180.0,"Your comparison is wrong. Bikes are known to get flat tires, it sucks but is considered within the norm for bikes. On the other hand hot tubs aren't expected to just stop working. If that happens, it indicates there is something overall wrong with the tub and likely going to take a trained professional to look at it and fix it. Plus incredibly dangerous. Changing a tire requires minimal effort and no expertise."
AmItheAsshole,fdwc4s9,t3_en8mzm,1578757211.0,"NAH. She won't remember. My mum works in aged care and if someone's partner dies and they have Alzheimer's they often won't be told.

Likely if you tell her, this will happen. She'll get upset, forget, ask about him, be told, get upset again, forget and so forth.

While your thoughts are in the right place, in this situation she is better off not knowing."
AmItheAsshole,fdwap26,t3_en8p6u,1578756778.0,"NTA. You have tried multiple solutions and she isn't playing ball. I've had housemates like this (but no where near as bad) and it's frustrating. They are an adult and should act like one. I once had a housemate put their washing in, set a timer (for 12 hours) but then not remove their stuff for 2 days.

Just keep moving her stuff out of the washer and into the laundry tub. I know its annoying and shouldn't be up to you but it's going to be the only way you can get your stuff washed."
todayilearned,fd8r108,t1_fd8m7iu,1578222131.0,Not actually reputable. The paper itself is from 1992 but it's sources are from as back as the 1920s. So definitely going to be bias against homosexuality.
todayilearned,fd8qqvs,t1_fd8qh0v,1578221999.0,"It was from a conservative sub and you assumed it was going to be credible? And if you're going to post things, you need to do your own research."
AskReddit,fd3wt6l,t1_fd31zc8,1578162296.0,"You need to move out of London. The English are absolutely lovely, just not Londoners but as others have said, that's like all major cities."
AskReddit,fd3qd53,t3_ejubhh,1578160789.0,"London. Grew up obsessed with British literature, TV and movies plus it was the furthest place from where I grew up (Melbourne Australia). Had looked to move a few times but never worked out. Then did a trip around Europe, starting in England. Just knew as soon as I arrived that I wanted to live there.

Move 3 and half years ago (as of yesterday). Still love it but wouldn't say it's easy. Have spent most of the time out of London which honestly helps. In a good area now where I'm close to London and can go in but still have the more English lifestyle.

As others have said it can be hard to make friends but that's more because I'm trying to make friends in my mid/late twenties when everyone already have established friendship groups. I find joining online groups to really good. There is a very different culture here, which I wasn't quite prepared for. But overall I do enjoy it, even if it was a little different than I was expecting.

Honestly I would never live back in Australia now. It's just too small for me now. Most people I know back home have never been out of their area. Plus I've adapted too much to over here to really fit in again."
AmItheAsshole,fcyjul1,t1_fcyb0xh,1578081294.0,"Not always true, I'm a teacher approaching my 30s and rent in a sharehouse because I don't have enough money to buy and don't want to waste the majority of my wage on a studio apartment. But certainly not in anyway considered low income. There are lots of reasons people want to rent a room."
AmItheAsshole,fcvaip7,t3_ej2sz8,1577998048.0,YTA firstly completely wrong about why women have casual sex. There are plenty of reasons why men and women have casual sex. And it's no better or worse for either gender. And you don't have the right to shove your opinion down anyone's throat. I hope your daughter gets away from you as soon as possible so she doesn't have to deal with your shit.
AmItheAsshole,fcupxin,t3_eiydga,1577986138.0,"NTA he didn't get fired because of you. He definitely would have already have been given warnings in the past. And either way, that is not how to behave in the work place. We all get banter but it needs to be both ways and both parties should find it funny. This guy clearly never grow up."
AmItheAsshole,fc74v5z,t1_fc6s7dt,1577497586.0,"Depends. I'm a teacher and putting in effort I can learn most students names within a month or so. But pronunciation can take a long time, honestly I've has students that I just couldn't say their name. Not because I'm not trying but I have a speech impediment. While it's not bad, it makes some sounds difficult, I even have colleagues ask me to repeat myself every now and again because of it. Not saying this is true of the nurse but maybe we shouldn't always assume the worst of people."
