It's nice to be a nice person, but honestly this is what happens half the time. Give them an inch and they take a mile. This has happened to me and my friend before but far less extreme."

relationship_advice,ffrci8o,t3_eutcvo,1580155219.0,"What you did and who you did before you entered a relationship with him, is absolutely none of his fucking business.

I would refuse to discuss it with him further and make him go to therapy, or how else can you move forward? His issue not yours.

Edit: not to mention the obvious gas lighting. Him telling you that you swore youd never sleep with the guy, which didn't happen. Him now making it about you going back on your word, that you never promised in the first place."
