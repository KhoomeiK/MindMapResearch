so if you think about the past and over analyze things. that's considered a disorder? 

to answer ur question, i think so. i might have mild autism. I was told that i was late to talking, but i just remember as a baby that i was too afraid to talk. not because i couldn't. I do seem to have a lot of these traits, over thinking, repetitive behavior, if im interested in something i'll be obsessed over it. Major communication issues, i was very shy as a child, I didn't have any friends till I was in the 2nd grade but I always felt awkward around ppl. i always felt different from evereyone else. i always felt uncomfortable using my body language. when i was a kid, i would always count 7 things before I left for school. 7 things to make sure I didn't forget anything. In fact, I don't think I ever lost or forgot any of my belongings. I always double or triple check before i leave. 

I also check too many things, for example. when im driving, i would always check if i have enough gas, look at speed limit, make sure my headlights are on, temperature and even make sure that widows are fully closed. I do this everytime i drive. I have hard time with change, I enjoy routines cause changing things requires a lot of my brain power to shift. I would have to re-adjust and adopt. im too tired to do that, so i want to keep things as it is. during conversations, i repeat myself a lot. saying my interest or my thoughts over and over."

yeah? just like in the 50's when we thought we'll have flying cars by the 1980s. the world hasn't changed much. only two inventions that really changed the world. internet changed how we get our information and smartphones changed our we interact with the world"
SuicideWatch,ffs5a7x,t1_ffs4w5p,1580173484.0,"im sorry, growing up. i thought it was my family that was like this. since i have high EQ, i learned very quickly that most ppl are like this. like they are literally stupid in sense of self awareness. they don't realize what they are doing or why they are doing it. GO to work, pay bills, have kids, post on insta, everyone just wants to fit in without understand why. it's a sad life, most ppl are sheeps"

and our society doesn't value ppl with self awareness. dumb ppl are required to function in our society. convincing dumbasses to join the military, to murder innocnet ppl to ""protect our country"". convincing nerds that working for a giant tech company is considered a ""success, and a great achievement"".  being self aware in our world is a terrible trait. dumb ppl with avg to high IQ is required to survive in this world. having high emotional intelligent is awful, because u seek emotional connection but everyone else is low EQ"
SuicideWatch,ffs47qm,t1_ffs3xwo,1580172724.0,"theres no point of talking to u. ur obviously not self aware and it's not something u can understand. understanding is IQ trait, they see things in concrete manner. that's why ppl are able to perform in school, at work and entertain themselves with mindless activities. ppl are dumb, they don't understand their own behaviors. 99.99% will live a meaningless life. they are a fucking trash really, easily replaceable by anyone else"

i had to walk away from conversations cause ppl would debate about music artist or sports. i just can't connect with 99.99% of population. i honestly think ppl have zero emotional intelligent. ppl have average to high IQ but they have low to none emotional intelligent. they are so self unaware, can't control their behavior in public. like, some ppl can't help themselves but to start a conflict or talk non-stop. ppl are legit retarded thinking anyone cares about em or will listen to them. everyone acts like a little kid in my eyes, they are so emotionally retarded. i'm sure ppl see me in opposite direction, i'm very wise, high situation awareness, very self aware but i have low IQ."

if i had cancer, i personally wouldn't get chemo. chemo also kills ur healthy cells. and most cancer comes back. i would just live the last moment of ur life in best way possible. i just can't picture myself wasting away ur limited time in a hospital bed. medication can only keep u alive. my grandma was in a hospital bed for almost 2yrs, they pumped shit ton of drugs onto his system but all he did was sleep and rot. hospitals are all about making profits, they don't give a fuck about ur life. he died after 2yrs but im sure he regrets his decision now"
