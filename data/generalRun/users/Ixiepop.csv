awfuleyebrows,fdrinw6,t1_fdq9it7,1578685109.0,"I recently stumbled upon “KALEIDO COSMETICS
Obsidian Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner” and it’s my new holy grail for winged eyeliner. It’s always crisp, dark, and precise. My wings were pretty good before finding it, but this made its 10x easier. It doesn’t cake up or smudge if you go in for a second coat. Best part? It’s only 8 bucks for a tube and it’s lasted me a good bit. 

Side tip, I use a business card or credit card to do the base of the wing. I hold the card at an angle coming out from the outer corner of my eye and make two swipes. One to get the bottom, the other to make the wing ‘curve’ onto my eyelid.

Hope this helps a bit"

wholesomememes,fcydc20,t1_fcxxi1o,1578078413.0,"Hi, I’m someone else other than who you’ve been replying to, but I got diagnosed with bi-polar disorder when I was 23, it was early onset at age 12/13. I dealt with a lot of self loathing and feeling of emptiness for much of my youth. Since then, I’ve found that learning to recognize and manage my symptoms has made my mental heath much better.

Doing self affirmations in the mirror when I’m getting ready helped me not hate the way I looked, doing self care of occasional luxurious baths or showers made me feel better for long enough to do more to help my state in life. Also subscribing to subreddits that encourage good mental health. (Or rather ones that aren’t like 2meirl4meirl and politics) 

One trick I learned recently is when your in a good mood, write self love notes to yourself and hide them so you find them randomly. It interrupts the self loathing mindset for a breath of good feelings."
