Nope, this is not true.  Federal Law says the Union can elect to negotiate, but they don't have to.  My experience was in NC.  Worked at a place that was an open shop, they had union and non-union drivers.  The Union drivers got way fewer benefits than the union drivers."

This is begging the question.

I agree with you that this is the result of rent-seeking.  But in economic theory, the answer to rent-seeking behavior is to eliminate the issue of regulatory capture, not impose another monopolistic system.  MCA will trade one devil for another.  If you eliminate the insurance industry and now have literally billions in government expenditure up for grabs what kind of rent-seeking do you think will come from that?  Or even worse how about a huge medicare agency run just like the good folks at the TSA.

I have family and friends who have used medical services in Italy, Canada, and France, *after* the US.  All of them would take the level of care provide in the US over those other countries.  Why is that?  They all have limited access.  That's the way they limit regulatory capture.

 The answer is to eliminate the reasons in the market for regulatory capture.  Chicago school of thought would be to drive market transparency and add the real ability to shop around (like I can with dental) or take the Keynesian version and invest large public funds into building hospitals, training doctors and subsidizing wealth transfers.

So you're doing what is akin to a sales funnel.  Instead of dropping your sales price, try to filter to people you can effectively ""upsell"" on your skillset.  Give them a range, but add the caveat ""Commensurate with my skill set"".  You can effectively negotiate even by opening, but it does take a different skill set.

Dance around the discussion, if you can.  ""Hey, you know I haven't heard what the job entails, but just throwing out a wild guess, I'd say it would be $XXX.""  If you can, take the call and do the interview.  If they come back to you, with a low ball number you can easily say, ""Hey considering what the job entails, this is what it is worth to me.""

But you have to dazzle them in the interview.  You have to show that you are in every single way a premium product that is worth paying for.  Remember, it's an opening salvo.  Convey to them that you're happy, but a good opportunity could sway you.  When recruiters cold-call me, I throw out an outrageous number.  I act like I'm playing with house money.  Frankly, it worked too well, the last recruiter who called I ended up in a new job with, *at that outrageous salary.*  I acted like I was the prize and they accepted it.

When you interview, you want to get through the HR guy as fast as possible, telling them what they want to hear, but not giving up too much to negotiate up from.  With the boss?

These two statements contain covert contracts.  You are putting undue expectations on the actions of others in regards to your actions.  You are only responsible for your actions.   Every woman's reaction has the potential to be different, so don't expect the same from all of them.

Second, if you are approaching life from a neutral standpoint, everything becomes *data.*  For all the flack they receive, this is the thing the PUA guys have.  They approach women in a neutral way, they see what works, they refine the outcome and try it again.

So how do you get better at pushups?  More pushups.  

So to get better at approaches, take away the outcome dependence.  Try building up to a full approach by doing small things to gather info on what you do better.  Talk to that barista while waiting on your coffee.  Ask a stranger where a good place is to eat.  Go to a store and ask a girl if a shirt is appealing. Join Toastmaster to work on your public speaking. Build all the skillsets that are part of being personable and make you interesting.

Ultimately get out of your own head.  If you are an average looking guy, the reality is, you are going to fail at approaches more than succeed.  You know what?  That's ok.

If you are working for Toyota, do they have an employee assistance plan that could get your tuition paid?  Start from there.  Go into your boss and tell him exactly that.  ""Hey, you know how hard it is to train engineers in the *Toyota way?* well I already understand the culture, I just need the degree""  Even if they don't go to the highest level manager you can who will listen and tell them exactly that.

Engineers take 4 years of schooling to mint, but practically speaking it's a good 4 to 5 years after that before they are dried off behind the ears and actually beyond the journeyman stage.  This is the advantage you can bring to a potential employer (your current one or a new one).  Your practical experience could prove invaluable in lowering that initial training.

My experience with technicians and factory level people who moved into technical roles with additional training has been overwhelmingly positive.  They bring a level of horse sense and practical understanding that the book-learned guys sometimes miss.  You'll also have a good level of trust from those floor level guys, so long as you stay humble in their eyes.

AskEngineers,feag9sd,t3_eo4jwi,1578948346.0,"I can add some insight from an entirely unrelated business.  For one, they do.  That's called market segmentation.  Do you want a 30-year-old simple tractor?  There are some really great tractors coming from India or Korea.  Simple machines that do basic tractoring.  

But what your asking really is why doesn't someone make a *John-Deere* from 30 years ago?

So I work in a business that sells capital equipment to people.  Anywhere from $100,000's to Millions for each piece of equipment.  Just like John Deere, these are heavily engineered and unfortunately for us, they last ten, twenty or even thirty years.  Our bread and butter income is actually aftermarket sales and service (much like I bet John Deere).  New Equipment keeps the lights on, but the aftermarket is what drives innovation and growth.

So for any piece of equipment, you have a few market forces competing against it.  You have like for like competitors.  You have used equipment, and you also have something completely different (For example do you buy that sports car you always dreamed of or go on an awesome vacation).

So in the case of John Deere, they aren't competing 1:1 with Mahindra, they are actually competing with all the other high-end companies that make direct replacements, most importantly they are competing with economics.  For example, if John Deere's combine-harvester can clear a wheat field over its lifetime at $0.001/Acre versus $0.0015/acre for the next competitor than that is a better deal regardless of purchase and ongoing costs.  John Deere just needs to show that they are a better return on investment (clearly they missed the mark on this one).

Ultimately no one wants to sell you one tractor.  They want to sell the end-user something that will continue to generate income for both the user and the seller.  Both want an income stream that is reliable.  Companies like Deere need to keep in mind, pigs get fat, but hogs get slaughtered.  Wall the garden in too much and you'll have competition eat your lunch, make it too open-source and you lose valuable revenue potential.  It's not an uncommon practice, but it can be ugly when applied poorly."
NMMNG,fe8pqep,t3_enxlav,1578929032.0,"One doesn't command respect.  History has a long list of tyrants who were feared, not respected.  

Respect is earned.  As a man, it is earned from your actions, not your words.

Let's start with your girlfriend.  What you are seeing from her are often called shit tests.  Women do them to see if you are strong in mind and body.  The simplest way to deal with them is to master the art of shut the fuck up.  Long term there's a whole litany of things you need to do, such as going to the gym, setting boundaries and making sure your life is organized.  I'd recommend reading Married Man Sex Life Primer as a start.  

If my wife just randomly started being mean (it's never random by the way) I'd walk away.  The other day we were having a bunch of people over for a family dinner and birthday celebration.  She got very testy with me so I scolded her. ""Hey, I don't know what is bothering you here but I can see that you are bothered, but if I don't know what your plan is, how am I supposed to keep things on track?  You being angry is not helping me help you."" 

I wasn't afraid of her emotions, I challenged her to own them, and I made it clear I wasn't going to let it continue being a boundary she could cross.  She came to me and apologized. 

If your partner was being condescending during a task, you have the choice to simply remove yourself.  ""Hey, I've got some other things I can work on. Let me know when you are in a better mood!"" and walk away calmly.  The key is, do not act butt-hurt.  You reward good behavior with time spent, and poor behavior you remove yourself.

You don't tell women how you feel, and that their actions make you feel a certain way.  Women communicate through emotion primarily and only communicate information when forced.  So while you may be telling her info that you felt offended or whatever, she hears things like ""I am a whiny male who is not in control of his emotions"".  So instead speak her language.  If she's being a harpy, go do something fruitful.  If she's being pleasant and sweet, joke around with her and have fun.  Your time is the most valuable thing you have, so give it to those who value it.

&#x200B;

If you look at her and she's acting poorly, instead of wondering how you can fix her feelings, instead realize they are her feelings.  It's pretty easy to deal with a woman when you look at her from a completely neutral standpoint and instead assess it from an *information-gathering perspective.*  Nice guys want to change people's feelings, which is wrong.  Instead, figure out what you can do to help them through their feelings.

*Hmmm, she seems upset.  I wonder what has upset her?  Now I know that the way she feels is not my responsibility, nor can I fix that, so what should I do here?  I don't own her feelings so they shouldn't make me uncomfortable.*

I usually start off by just acknowledging that there is emotion.  Often that's enough to move on.

history,fds03u6,t1_fdrw15q,1578692272.0,">Soviets were not known for battlefield improvisation.

Alright, let me clarify and add to this.  Their modern battleplan was still Echeolonment.  They also had a massive conscript Army that did not rely heavily on the NCO for leadership (Neither did the Wermacht for that matter).  Soviet soldiers were pretty clever and they did do a lot of battlefield innovation, but in general, being an independent thinker was not a good trait for soviet citizens.

Force Concentration became their operational doctrine for this Echeolonment that I'm talking about.  If you can place superior numbers in front of an enemy you can see exponential results either by the rate at which you inflict damage or the number of people inflicting that damage.  So you either throw bodies at something or throw force at it.  What did the Soviets have more of at the start of the war?  After 50 years of the cold war, the US answer was don't allow them to apply force concentration.

I think everyone agrees the Germans were incompetent.  I'm not even arguing that.  But I will say, given competent leadership, they still lacked the war machine to ultimately defeat the Soviets in a war of attrition."
AskEngineers,fdrx5ql,t1_fdrpz2c,1578691058.0,"You keep missing the point (and off on a little science).  Let's refresh, the fire triangle is Heat-Oxygen-Fuel, all connected, all equal.  First of all, get away from the idea that flames=fire.  Flames are the hot gas that results from combustion.

Materials have a combustion point.  Remove that and you remove a leg of the fire triangle. (heat)

Materials also have a minimum Oxygen threshold at which they burn (Oxygen).  Lower that threshold, and you remove a leg. 

Fire needs to consume something, remove that (fuel) and you remove another leg.

&#x200B;

So you could spray a bunch of water on something like a wood fire, and it will deprive the reaction of Oxygen (carbon doesn't burn in water under STP), so the fuel could be at 2000C and only drop to 1000C; still hot enough to burn, but its the blanketing of water prevent air and oxygen.

Or maybe that fire is so big that you keep spraying it with water, but it's got so much latent heat in it that it eventually drys off the wet fuel and re-ignites (its why you see firemen spraying down houses after they've burnt)

Or maybe now that you've sprayed that big fire down, you decide to bulldoze it apart to starve it and get water better sprayed on the material.

&#x200B;

Another way to look at it, reduce oxygen by 50%?  If you went from 21% O to 10.5% but the ignition threshold is still 9% you didn't get there.  Or if you went from 1000F to 455F that's a reduction of temp by 545 degrees, but... not enough.  

In chemical processing we use two standards worldwide, ATEX in Europe and NFS in the US.  Keeping fires and explosions from happening is about mitigating all possible legs of the triangle, because just like I said, one fire may be different from the next."
history,fdru7w3,t1_fdrjrhs,1578689773.0,"If you read about cold war plans for the soviet block the US realized this.  Soviet Military Doctrine was based on Echelonment.  Essentially wave after wave of Soviet bloc troops. 

One telling example of soviet military doctrine was you could look at satellite images of tank and artillery ranges, and the formations were repeated so often that there were actual ruts formed in the practice field.  Soviets were not known for battlefield improvisation.   Their plan was simple, throw bodies and equipment at you until you were overrun. 

So the American, and therefore NATO strategy became, how do we multiply forces.  If the soviets have 5000 main battle tanks, how do we stop them with 1000?  If the Soviets have 5000 SU-23's how do we defeat them with 1000 F-15's?  If the Soviets were to push through Europe with a massive front, supported by Deep Divisions how do we take the war deep into these columns before they ever get to the front?  The US ultimately developed a concept that was instead of winning a war against the soviets 15-12, how do we ensure we would win 100-0.  

Tom Clancy does a really good job of covering this in his non-fiction, *Into the Storm: On the Ground in Iraq.*  Desert Storm was a culmination of 50 years of American preparation fo face Soviet technology.

If one were to use this as the starting point, of how could the Germans have defeated the Soviets, they would have had to have taken the same tact.  Don't fight on a man to man basis.  Don't fight a single front.  Most of all don't fight a war of attrition against a numerically superior foe.

Could they have won (much like the US war plan)?  Who knows.  But the moment they committed using conventional tactics they were doomed.  They didn't have long-range bombers (huge mistake).  They didn't have overwhelming air superiority.  They didn't have the ability to maintain deep logistical operations and take the fight deep beyond the battlefront.   They couldn't starve the enemy.

So yeah, could they have beat them?  Anything is possible.  But 99 times out of 100 if they commit to operation Barbarosa with the same equipment and personnel, they are doomed to failure."
