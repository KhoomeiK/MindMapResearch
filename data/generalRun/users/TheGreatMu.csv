MDMA,ff2tqbg,t1_ff2ryfg,1579523784.0,"Yeah i plan on doing that 100%. Going to up my meditation and be more careful tripping next time!

thanks!"
MDMA,ff2towg,t1_ff2t61w,1579523737.0,"Other than my dads cardiac arrest, there is no other family history. Even his parents died old. He smoked 20 years, pack a day.

It's likely in my mind. I used to exercise rigorously for hours. Odd for it to come up now i suppose!

Thanks bro"
MDMA,ff2pfnv,t1_ff2osbt,1579517840.0,"Thank you brother. This pretty much summed everything up. It felt like i was gonna die from heart attack. And even right now days later... I have it in the back of my head, funny enough.

But yeah, also i got stoned when i tripped before hospital and i felt weak just walking 15-30 steps... that alarmed me too. But again seems to be panic induced!

I'm 25 and not fat so it was weird. 

Thanks for the reply bro! I think ill take a break till April-ish."
MDMA,ff2ofb7,t1_ff2nn14,1579516293.0,"Really?? Well dude, ive done acid 2x before this and it was fine. Good trips for the most part. I've also done MDMA once before, and i was also fine. So Idk, really weird.
Hopefully just stress brother.
Much love, thank you for the insight!"
LSD,ff2aybv,t1_fez7w1f,1579499145.0,"Perhaps I'll check out that sub before i do that. My friends hyped the shit out of it, so i suppose i believe them, that 1 cap was nothing in comparison.
If i were to take it right now, after what you just told me, I'd probably think I'm for sure dying again and would end up calling emergency again.."
LSD,feyscnl,t1_feyqyq9,1579450010.0,"Ok well if thats the case i will start with 200 next time and have a booster of 100 if I go well.
But since i did it 2 weeks ago, ill likely wait till mid March or April!

Does Mdma play on your heart? Actually while on the subject, does shrooms, lsd and DMT play on the heart?
And by that i mean moreso than just weed does.

Thank you so much for all the advice ma man. Has really helped.

If you have anymore to add, its more than welcome."
LSD,feykoae,t1_feyk15x,1579446866.0,"I see what you mean. Yeah i don't plan on doing that. It's too much for sure. But to be honest with you. I would like to try dosing 200-300mg some time. For the experience and what not. I really hope this panic attack doesn't become a thing whenever i take either substance. I think I'm going to exercise more cardio, eat better and meditate alot more as well. 
I feel as though that'll affect whether i panic or not as well as set and setting ofcourse.

But even now i am lowkey monitoring my heart even though they tested me and i was good. That experience sorta made me afraid that i could drop dead at any moment. It's quite scary."
LSD,feyihl9,t1_feygbxv,1579445912.0,"I don't plan to ever do cocaine tbh. Even ketamine. My friends have drug cocktails where they'll mix MDMA 3caps with cocaine, ketamine, weed, alcohol.

They don't seem to have suffered much from these cocktails. But at one point one of them was quite fried for a few months..."
LSD,feyhtz5,t1_feygz96,1579445780.0,"Alot of my peers take 3-6 caps (100mg each) throughout an entire night. Starting off with 2 or 3 and then having 1 or so as a booster dose.

Granted they wait a while each time. But yeah.
I did 100mg both times, and it was quite intense. But they act as if 100mg is nothing and that i haven't experienced anything yet."
LSD,feydq4s,t1_fey8guu,1579444207.0,"Wow, thanks heaps for the info btw!

So wb dropping 200-300mg then a booster of 100-200mg once every 6 months? 
Do you think that would definitely cause neurotoxicity or some long term damage?

I, myself have only done MDMA 2x. Once on 2017 and once almost 2 weeks ago.

I try to becareful with substances and the only one i admit i can binge/abuse every now and again is weed.
I've never done any ""hard drugs"". Only weed, lsd, shrooms, Mdma, and Dmt. 
As i feel those are quite safe through vicarious experience and a bunch of psyched substance videos!"
LSD,feycrys,t1_fey9yg8,1579443851.0,Wow. I should take it alot more serious then. I suppose this substance can definitely fry you.
LSD,fey5203,t1_fexv2bj,1579440885.0,You can't really blame that on purity of the drug. More so on me being inexperienced and not having a good setting when i panicked
LSD,fey4sal,t1_fexubqj,1579440817.0,I've heard of people taking 30 tabs and tripping for 2 days. Psychedsubstance did say no one has ever died from LSD alone. So i assume its like weed in the sense that you can't really OD
LSD,fey4bme,t1_fexvmg5,1579440705.0,"Oh sweet. So you can't get serotonin syndrome from that combo?

Theres basically no risk for either MDMA or LSD? 
Other than it not being pure?

I had a friends ex boyfriend take 20 caps (100mg each) in 4 days. So 2 grams in 4 days..

I'm not too sure what the risk with MDMA is as google is very vague for some reason.

Any idea where overdose territory is for MDMA? 
And does it change when candy flipping??"
LSD,fextt6c,t1_fextozz,1579436074.0,"Thats true. So given they are pure (I test my acid) then it is safe? MDMA my friends get seems to be quite pure. Ive experienced no comedown and it lasted 3-5hrs.

I plan on getting a test kit for that also."
LSD,fextn85,t1_fexgjd8,1579435865.0,"Yeah, my set and setting wasn't exactly perfect for candy-flip or for the 2 tabs afterwards..
Candy flip i was heaps depressed/exhausted...
And the 2 tabs i was very rushed and it was real late. 

So i suppose it was deserved.."
LSD,fextgr4,t1_fexslbg,1579435765.0,"Well you can't overdose on LSD. I'm not sure if you can overdose on PURE LSD as Google hasn't been clear on that at all for some reason... 

All i know is if you use a drug that binds to serotonin and you take SSRI'S (anti-depressants) then it for sure can be fatal and cause serotonin syndrome."
LSD,fext8bh,t1_fexhtvp,1579435631.0,"100% showed me how love is number 1 most important thing in life. Not money, not status or any bullshit like that. But other people."
LSD,fexsmk0,t1_fexn3io,1579435514.0,"You can't OD on acid. I'm not too sure about MDMA, there are charts online that show you which drug combinations go well, and which to look out for or can be dangerous. MDMA, LSD, SHROOMS, DMT. The chart shows a green light for those. But a caution when you add marijuana..

I'm somewhat inexperienced. I've done acid now 4x in 2 years. Shrooms about 3x and MDMA 2x. 

Do you thinking mixing MDMA and LSD is dangerous?"
LSD,fex05s3,t1_fewybng,1579422174.0,"I feel ya, but my candy flip experience was probably the most transformative.

My close friend thinks Mdma gave him ego death.
From my experience, i feel like Mdma is more than just a party drug, it works heavily on environment.

So if you take it at a party it won't be as much of a psych.

But if you take it alone or with a small group of friends just chilling. It can act as a psychedelic even by itself!

Both are powerful drugs when used correctly."
LSD,fewxlar,t1_fewwxcw,1579421040.0,"I see, no family history of mental issues. Just dads cardiac arrest after smoking 20 years. But hes still alive and doctors have said he will live to his 70s.

I really do wish to do psychs again as i really do like them."
LSD,fewxafu,t1_fewwi56,1579420907.0,"Oh, can you get serotonin syndrome from candy flipping? I googled it and it says that you can pretty much mix the main psychedelics and its synergized, no negative repercussions.. ( by main i mean, shrooms, lsd and DMT.)

Even now my heart feels weird, but I'm beginning to think its all in my head. Even after the testing. It's almost as if I only hear what i want to hear. My sis was there with me and she says its all fine..

Perhaps i should take a few months off, and for confidence sake work on cardio more."

LSDTripLifeHacks,fdckqmt,t1_fdckldr,1578277330.0,Yeah dude. No biggie. Please try meditate more. Like daily. Start at 1minute and work your way up. This really helps.
LSDTripLifeHacks,fdcjmc2,t1_fdcj198,1578276528.0,"Yeah, you can't force it. I've been chasing a complete ego death for a while, also DMT breakthroughs too. Which i still havent had. Im trying to figure out how and i think the best way is to clear your mind, meditate and let things come to you. This is my trial and error. 

Your mind can't be to active when you take it. You have to have a accepting mindset going in. Try not have expectation and do it for the experience. Don't force anything.

If you want a full ego death, I'd meditate and eat well for a month prior to taking a high dose. Also meditate once you ingest it until it kicks in. 
Thats the closest ive gotten.

Also do it alone and in a place you are 100% comfortable with. Set yourself up really well so you are uninterrupted for at least 8 hours.
Go for quality as opposed to quantity.
You wanna make sure your mind isn't foggy and your mind is relatively clear."
Drugs,fdcj2t7,t1_fdbhdfk,1578276142.0,"So weed and Dmt is a good idea? Ive wanted to try it, but i heard it makes shit weird."
LSDTripLifeHacks,fdciy1j,t1_fdciqo8,1578276050.0,"I see, all i can say when shit like that happens is embrace it. I usually write on my hands, ""meditate"" ""you're on lsd"" ""breathe"" ""pain is temporary"".

Perhaps have a break for a month man. Don't abuse it, really takes away how special it is"
LSDTripLifeHacks,fdcioat,t1_fdcii0k,1578275861.0,Yeah exactly. What happened with your bad trip? Was it showing you how much of a loser you are? Or was it just unreasonable fear and torment
AskReddit,fdciixe,t3_ekf2qh,1578275758.0,Drugs and fast food.
LSDTripLifeHacks,fdciagp,t1_fdcgqbb,1578275590.0,"That is weird. 

Well for example when i did Lsd my first time with a friend, he convinced me to drive him to his house, which was about a 10-15m drive. He had to go toilet. That was the reason.
I said no, Im unable to drive but eventually gave in after another hour. Something I'd normally never ever do. 
It was 200ug and i ended up driving him after about 5 hrs into the trip. I also had to stop before even gettin halfway because it was overwhelming.

On my 2nd lsd trip i took 360ug with the same person, we got uber eats 4 hours later after mixing it with weed. The delivery driver was waiting on the street so i made my friend go get it. He comes back scared, his energy totally different, because we forgor about the uber eats and the driver had been waiting for about 15mins. So when my friend got it, he was quite mad.

He didn't say anything. My friend could sense it. Just like i could sense the fear my friend had when he came back with the food. We ended up having a very paranoid trip that he was going to come break in and stab/kill us. 

We searched my entire house 5x. And still felt bad. Ended up smoking more weed to get rid of the paranoia. It worked.

So there it is. Lsd makes you very sensitive and suggestible to your environment and mindset. 

Which is why set and setting is key. Also don't abuse it bro, doesn't help. 


TL;DR: LSD makes you sensitive and suggestible to your environment and mindset, anything can affect  your trip.  Be careful what you do and who you trip with. My friend made me drive on first trip and second his unreasonable fear was contagious, even though we were consciously aware it was dumb."
LSDTripLifeHacks,fdcggqn,t3_ekhqnu,1578274298.0,"Could be a multitude of things, how do you have it more than once a fortnight??

Isn't there a 2 week tolerance?

As for bad trips, it can definitely be because of abusing it. Set and setting. If your brain is dopamine deficient (you don't feel to great) thats another reason)

You're also highly suggestive which can affect your trip dramatically."
Tinder,fdb18p5,t3_eka4x0,1578252594.0,Why is everyone being mean to you lol. I found it hilarious. I was expecting people to sympathize with you but i get this instead!

Drugs,fdary05,t1_fd9llnz,1578249329.0,"So you don't let emotions get to you as much?

I've been chasing ego death for a while. Ive done lsd and shrooms abour 2-3x each. With 360ug and 5grams of shrooms max.

This week im gettin 180ug, 100mg Mdma, some weed and some DMT in the mix. If i don't have an ego death. I'm sure it'll be a pleasurable experience!"

I know the shit i wrote is similar to people who don't understand depression. But i tried giving a spin on it because i feel the way i explained it is relatable to me. So i think it may touch others too. 

Pure logic vs pure emotion. They can't communicate. Different languages."
depression,fcyc10v,t3_ejgi2m,1578077821.0,"I'm beginning to believe the answer and cure to depression is through self belief. 

You can live for yourself. I feel like that also. Hell last month my closest friend since 2009, called me toxic and a constant downer. So we stopped talking.

Point is. Get rid of anything that is stopping you from thinking you are a King/Queen. Thats the first step to recovering, whether its weed or gaming or toxic people. 


There is always a way my friend. Truly. I figured i may as well die trying to be happy. And if it doesn't work out. I'm going to OD on something.

Suicide is control. Something we feel we don't have. Ironically enough... death and whatever happens when we die. 
What says we have more or less control?

We gotta keep trying. It's chemicals in our brain. If we can change the pattern they have. Then it'll change on its own (homeostasis). 

3 months to create a lifestyle. Therefore  3 months for your brain to change the way it fires!

You got this bro. I believe in you. I really fuckin do.

But it doesn't mattee if i do. It only matters if you do.

Make this world yours."
depression,fcyamtf,t1_fcxtuf0,1578077220.0,"I see what you mean and I'd like to add onto that. 

A big part of it is if you THINK you will be like that, then you will increase the likelihood of being like that significantly. Through my experience thus far.

Everytime I've gotten in and out of it. It has been because I have somewhat anticipated it happening. 

For example, ive now been in this loops for just about 2 whole years now. Since I got broken up with. Now I had a feeling this would happen. But the anticipation of it did some damage also.
Thinking this person can kill me from breaking up with me. Visualizing it as well.

I deeply feel like that helped me reach a new level of depression through the power of believing i am nothing once this person breaks up with me.

It's the power of our thoughts. 

Thoughts control our Emotion which controls our Behaviour.


TL;DR: Believing you are weak makes you significantly weaker. 

THOUGHTS CONTROL US MORE THAN WE ALLOW CREDIT FOR.

THOUGHT = EMOTION = BEHAVIOR! 

its a cycle."
depression,fcy8nck,t3_ejduke,1578076382.0,"Depression is a big fuck around. I feel as though its a ""doomed if you do, doomed if you don't"" kinda situation. 

I don't find anything that gives me passion or anything like that any more, but if i kill myself to escape this empty feeling. Then I'm dead and I don't know where that leads. So its like fear is keeping me here. But its also pushing me to suicide as well. 

Then like you said Family! Another reason not to do it. It's a constant back and forth.

Thing is. Do i end this game BEFORE I've tried my best? And by that i mean. Try things that are proven to mend this emptiness.

My next attempt is to have a dopamine fast. No artificial dopamine. No weed. No games. No quick fake stimulation. 

Perhaps the reason i have lost myself is because im surrounded by artificial stimuli all around me. And I'm too afraid to go without it. 

Another thing is sleep, it's 5:28AM rn. My sleeps trash.


At the end of the day. We are feeling like this because of a misfire of chemicals in our brains. I've had anti-depressants before and they just limited my emotions. Which isn't a fix. 


Another reason to keep going: If we can feel THIS shitty. Then it must work the opposite way too. If we push through, truly start believing we are changing. Then we must also be able to feel amazingly good and confident. 

Thats the trophy. At least for me. If i can be happy and/or confident. Then I'd die for the chance to live. 

We can do this. Surround ourselves with those who understand and believe in us!"
