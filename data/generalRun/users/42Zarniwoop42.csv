edit: original comment is an Amish joke. Responder references an interesting execution of essentially the same joke with r/Amish, but it's not like he's copying and making the joke worse. Then visible confusion is just a classic internet reaction. Audible confusion is just Reddit being Reddit by making strange alternations to a comment and forming a chain. Idk maybe I guess visible confusion is a joke that Amish people wouldn't visibly be confused because they aren't on the internet so then audible is being taken as an over explanation of that not-really-sensical joke (?) Really if either visible or audible confusion is being taken as a joke here I'm just disappointed anyone took the time to post this at all"
