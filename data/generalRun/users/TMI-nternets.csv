This is probably one of the worst things about him. How he's gullible and utterly ineffectual in navigating reality. 

We've got a leader here who's unable to figure out which part of the stick is sharp and consequently can be bamboozled all the way by anyone patient enough to talk to him.

Throw it up there as a youtube flic and throw the profit after Snopes after paying for creative services.
