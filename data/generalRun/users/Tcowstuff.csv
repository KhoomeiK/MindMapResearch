worldnews,ffkubs8,t1_ffko69k,1580029033.0,"Yes, because there are also a lot of people on WeChat saying the exact opposite. So there are two conflicting viewpoints right now on Chinese social media. And yes, mass hysteria is happening there as well."
news,ffkofzn,t1_ffjtbtj,1580026130.0,There’s already a lot of mistrust in the government there. Everyone in China is complaining about them.
PublicFreakout,ffjfdoj,t1_ffj32oy,1579997084.0,"Considering the large amount of anti China posts that do make it to the front page, I don’t agree with your conspiracy theory."
ChoosingBeggars,ffjegcl,t1_ffj347x,1579996537.0,"This doesn’t seem like roasting. It’s more like he straight up disrespects you, IMHO. I’ve seen what roasting is like and it’s not this. Or maybe you guys have reached an entirely new level. As long as you give him the same amount of shit, lol."
videos,ffh66w0,t1_fffclt3,1579924216.0,Not really. It’s just a cheap dirty fix and expected from them anyway. Nothing noble at all about what they’re doing lmao.

EDIT: but seriously, I’m taking the fact that we  don’t know what we don’t know."
worldnews,ffeiy5z,t1_ffe9tds,1579849908.0,"It’s western born chinese with deep patriotic roots with their family/country. Also Chinese who have lived in western countries since they were young. That being said, their member count is nothing. Hell, r/adultery has more than double the members, lol."
todayilearned,ff5dvss,t1_ff5bxk0,1579588755.0,"Nobody agrees war is good. But it’s quite evident that the solution is not as simple, dumbed down and Disney fairytale-like as people make it out to be in the comments."
todayilearned,ff562it,t1_ff52elb,1579581264.0,Nailed it.
news,ff2iby8,t1_ff28b7a,1579507400.0,Hate speech 101 fellas. Categorising an entire population of people as subhuman pests. Let’s see where this ends up.

worldnews,feqp306,t1_feqnp4f,1579344465.0,"Maybe, but not necessarily. The pollution may/may not be related at all. The other factors could even include specific work conditions, etc. We don’t know until the science can prove a causation, or relationship."
worldnews,feqgmg3,t1_feqdv0u,1579341626.0,Correlation does not imply causation.

facepalm,fec7h41,t1_fec66ee,1578967974.0,"So technically shaming someone about their weight isn’t body shaming? Because bar the minority of people where it’s purely “genetics”, you can always work it off right?"

science,fdpmsc7,t1_fdnnybw,1578633083.0,I think it’s more the income gap than actual objective poverty that’s the issue.
science,fdnga8d,t1_fdnfdg7,1578585178.0,So the highest suicide rates in the world would be in places in Africa for example? Would that be true?

Cringetopia,fdc2aon,t1_fdbyng2,1578265693.0,"Probably the same reason why people get downvoted for posting pro China comments too. I.e. not bots, just people taking sides. Comments get downvoted first and then upvoted afterwards all the time. Honestly, as much as I respect your sentiment, I don’t think China plays their game like this because it’s highly ineffective."
PublicFreakout,fd5y2lh,t1_fd46rpq,1578182947.0,I don’t think they took it that seriously. I think it was more of an over the top ridiculous joke than a statement.

nihilism,fcu1ary,t1_fctvtwd,1577969179.0,"Different for me. Optimism provides me with emotional protection. Because if happiness is HP, it’s better to start off with higher HP, because it can always go down to negative values."

instantkarma,fcm35rf,t1_fclzir2,1577763020.0,It’s actually self defence. Some random guy ramming your window until it breaks can be considered quite a scary life threatening situation to the driver.

AdviceAnimals,fc74wip,t1_fc6v6an,1577497614.0,"That particular story isn’t actually true. If people read the article, it was locally banned by Turkish mods in Turkey only. The whole thing about gay stuff being banned in all of Tik Tok by the Chinese isn’t true."
