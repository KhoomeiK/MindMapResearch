Machinists,ff83ac6,t1_ff7qcuh,1579664844.0,Some oil/wd40 might help. Probably a smaller lathe so rigidity/low spindle speed is an issue. Only thing gonna make a good finish with that is really sharp HSS tooling and/or scotchbrite.

Machinists,ff81cmv,t1_ff7mud2,1579663419.0,It's not a low starting wage imo. I was making about $29/hr and took a job starting out at $24/hr partly because I was topped out at $29 and the pay scale at the new place goes much higher than $29. Also depends entirely on where the job is. This wage is good in Kansas but bad in the bay area. Of course I wish machinists were paid better but realistically I think this is a good starting wage.

In this industry you can make money by being a problem solver or being a button pusher.

When it starts inexplicably chattering and your partoff blades start breaking you have some indications that the turret needs to be aligned. Idk how to avoid it.

There's a lot more you can ask of a machinist. I would take corrective action if I saw an employee who was happy with these chips. They're dangerous while turning and they take up a lot of space which is an issue if you do a lot of aluminum turning and want to recycle them. Smaller chips=less trips to the recycler"
