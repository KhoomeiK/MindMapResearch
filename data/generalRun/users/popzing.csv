I suggest socializing them often and using calm reassuring babble when they see anything new. If they think they are supposed to love it they will. Dont wind up any dog and it will remain calm and happy, they want to please. Calm happy tones and redirecting bad habits gently and consistently is the way. They dont respond well to anger.they are pretty emotional but in a good way, they love to cuddle and will do anything to earn warmth from people."

Dogs are like their people, just keep them involved in your life and they will flank you with purpose. They are like any other dog. People have some wacky ideas of what Dalmatians are like but unless you are a mess your dog will fall into the family as they should. I never even lost a shoe to puppy teeth. They pottied outside right away and are clean. They do shed like crazy, but we have leather furniture and wood floors so it is easy to keep up on. Your pup is really beautiful!!"

Trump is jealous"
