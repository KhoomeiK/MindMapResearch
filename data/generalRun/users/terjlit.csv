cats,ffwyhgl,t3_evmbg2,1580313856.0,I strongly suggest yes
PoliticalDiscussion,ffa8ast,t1_ff9zcdn,1579729833.0,I know a guy who knows a guy....  that's worth looking into...
PoliticalDiscussion,ffa7zow,t1_ffa0ysw,1579729660.0,Yep... I agree with your opinion...
PoliticalDiscussion,ffa7uve,t1_ffa20a4,1579729585.0,I disagree with your opinion.  Vitriol doesn't help change the masses.  Perhaps a small bit but the hating Berine won't change the thought process anyway.  I'm more inclined to vote for a person of character.
PoliticalDiscussion,ffa74vl,t1_ffa36nr,1579729182.0,I agree. Corporate media portrays him as a rebel rouser yet he speaks for the majority of the American people.... that's disturbing to me.
PoliticalDiscussion,ffa6um1,t1_ffa3dgl,1579729021.0,That was a very salient comment...
PoliticalDiscussion,ffa6j0a,t1_ffa5z5e,1579728845.0,I agree with your statement.
PoliticalDiscussion,ffa6h0t,t3_es7sf5,1579728815.0,It shows a lot regarding Hillary's views as wishy-washy and down right two-faced in the light of day. Bernie Sanders hasn't changed his views and the issues are still valid.  Impact? I hope he rises to win the Iowa caucus. Purely my hope...
OurPresident,ff95kgd,t3_es3avw,1579705363.0,That warms my heart
AskReddit,ff7xzdm,t3_es3far,1579661030.0,"Well.... I was  stabbed two times in the neck and four times in the chest. My carotid artery was cut and I saw the blood spurting out of my neck. I remember putting my hand over the neck wound thinking... WTF? I guess I passed out.  My next memory of the occurrence was of seeing myself on the operating table with 6 people working on my neck. I was looking down... I traveled up. I heard a voice tell me, ""you'll live"". I woke up in the hospital. The stabbing day was the 26th of October 1997. The waking up occurred on Halloween. I suffered a stroke from the lack of blood to the brain. The surgeon's patched up my artery with gortex. That's my brush with death."

AskReddit,ff1w14u,t1_ff1fkg9,1579487455.0,I thought a donation meant to were giving at support the candidate.  Similar to a donations for a church of non-profit organization... just to support the cause.  Too different outcomes between donation vs. bribery

AskReddit,ff1eahy,t3_er4jrg,1579478097.0,They would only be bribes if the person giving wanted something in return for it.

AskReddit,feyy15k,t1_fewirdy,1579451844.0,"I'm sorry... I'm saying that I myself never received racism from others. To generalize all into position of 'fuck' definitely didn't doesn't really matter if you think about the why. I'm saying, as a so called  'white person' that the real reason, in my opinion, that the socially accepted term is flawed due to the 'fear of others' be it white, black, and other generalizes terms than are definitely more ethnic than race.... scientifically I'm part of the human race... 

All people are subjected to the status quo norms and the real, sometimes deadly, problems in society come from the class divisions rather than race. Again, all aspects of what I speak of come my perspective and thought processes. It's better to remove my uncomfortably and think about why somebody that says 'fuck white people'

I'm sorry if I offended anyone but as least now you understand why I replied that way... human beings are complicated..."

funny,fev6icg,t3_eqoj7a,1579393656.0,"We live in a society where racism is socially acceptable... racist thoughts are ingrained in the psyche of everyone as part of the status quo.  It's inevitable that anyone claiming that they aren't racist is doesn't even know they are.  Scientifically speaking... the only race we have is human... 
Purely my thoughts on this meme and subjective discussion..."
