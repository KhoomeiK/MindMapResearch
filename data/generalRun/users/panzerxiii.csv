beerporn,ffd3wyd,t1_ff9d36w,1579812931.0,"> I've never considered that Tree House doesn't can green like other places. Do you know why they don't?

It's because they are canning it so that it's perfect at time of canning, which is good. When you get their beers on the day they drop, they're incredible.

Also because other spots generally don't have as much space so they push beers out the door.

Cynic in me: I also think they want to discourage trading/muling. A lot of NE brewers have this mentality, where they want to control the process completely up until sale. Which is fair, tbh.

> It's my understanding that Tree House has to basically horde hops that meet their standards for their really hyped beers and that's why they are exclusive.

This is true for almost all brewers; the largest barrier to entry for new breweries is actually acquiring high quality hops. However, other breweries of this caliber have figured this out and don't have the same limitations.

> And if Tree House wants to build the hype and wants the long line snaking into the parking lot why did they expand their hours? Why are they hiring so many people? Why are they aggressively expanding their facilities? It just doesn't add up to me.

Because they want to make more money by increasing production and if they didn't do any of those things, the lines would be absolutely impossible? Also the scene as a whole is growing still.

I thought Trill did singles too?"
