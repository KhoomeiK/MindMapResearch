Its ok to try to meet those goals, but take some time to find out who you really are.  Schedule some alone time and just sort out your feelings.  Maybe write thoughts or dreams in a journal, put on headphones and listen to music without words that let you explore your feelings, wonder through a museum and decide is you like fauvism, dada, Impressionism, realism or what.

Think about *why* you like what you like.  When you know yourself and are comfortable with yourself, you will be surprised at how the world responds to you.  Others will see you as someone who is competent and self assured.  And you will be."
aww,ffmhiky,t1_fflz99y,1580054709.0,"I honestly thought it was for training or fundraising purposes.  Both make sense. 

Training dogs to recognize and respond to something like this doesnt seem difficult; Ive seen my older daughters rescue dog (with zero training) respond well to my other daughter with a chromosomal defect that leaves her with some autistic like behaviors.  But it does take a special kind of dog and training.  Showing this video, just how moving and effective it is would encourage people to work with dogs like this and train them, and for others to be willing to fund that training.

We looked into getting a dog for our special needs child, but its time consuming and can be expensive; you must go and stay with the trainers for a week to acclimate both the child and dog to work together.  We didnt have the time or money for this.  So, this could also be a video to encourage people to donate money to help families go through the process of getting a helper dog.

Dogs seem to instinctively know that our special needs child isnt malicious, but she does occasionally hug too hard or do something that hurts the dog.  Our older daughters dog just gives her a little yip and moves away from her.  She gets mad, but we remind her that she has to be gentle if she wants the dog to sit by her.  An hour later, hell be asleep with his head on her lap and her hand resting on his back.  Hes a really good dog."

Seems Trump has taken credit for a bill co-authored by Bernie Sanders and signed into law by then president Obama.  Trump expanded it a little, but not to the extent that the VA is seeing relief.

Trump also took credit for giving service men and women a raise, but the truth is reported that they get a raise every year, not just under Trump.

Trump has offered extra assistance to look into suicide among veterans, but for some reason, the VA still hasnt spent the over $500,000 they have in their budget to do that.

The Gashlycrumb Tinies (1963)
The Gashlycrumb Tinies: or, After the Outing is an abecedarian book written by Edward Gorey that was first published in 1963. Gorey tells the tale of 26 children (each representing a letter of the alphabet) and their untimely deaths in rhyming dactylic couplets, accompanied by the author's distinctive black and white illustrations. It is one of Edward Gorey's best-known books,[1] and is the most notorious amongst his roughly half-dozen mock alphabets.[2] It has been described as a ""sarcastic rebellion against a view of childhood that is sunny, idyllic, and instructive"".[2] The morbid humor of the book comes in part from the mundane ways in which children die, such as falling down the stairs or choking on a peach. Far from illustrating the dramatic and fantastical childhood nightmares, these scenarios instead poke fun at the banal paranoias that come as a part of parenting.[3]
The first related work to the Gashlycrumb Tinies by a different author details the mis-adventures the children experience that leads them to their final demise, as depicted in Gorey's illustrations.[4]

Reese is ex-military, but he got burned.  Like the kid told him in Wolf and Cub, Reese is a samurai whose master made him do bad things, kill the wrong guys.  Reese doesnt need someone elses rules, but he does have his own.

I suspect this is true of every type of video.  If someone presents a tutorial that is unsafe or outright dangerous, YouTube has to be notified.  And yes, this happens on channels that have lots of views and subscribers.  

In other words, we really need to make informed choices, and if we see something we are knowledge about, and recognize misinformation, we should flag the video and *give a reasonable explanation* why it is wrong and should be checked by YouTube.

The PT in the pool motivated me to attempt to get stronger.  The PT also gave me some tools to work with:  exercises I could do in the water for upper and lower body strengthening.  For months after, all I could do was the routine I had learned in PT, but I did it a few times every week, but now in a local city pool.  It took months to be able to swim all the way across the pool and back again without a break.  It was probably a year before I could swim for 10 minutes without stopping.

This was all a while ago, but I continue to add swimming to my workout.  My body is actually sore if I don’t swim, so during times when the pool is closed, like over Christmas, I have to do more weight training and stretching.

I was hospitalized for a week, and of course the doctor suggested exercise to get stronger.  I asked if I could have PT in a pool, since I knew the hospital had a warm therapy pool.  In the pool, I felt light and movement was easy, so I worked very hard, and then nearly passed out when I got out of the pool and felt the full weight of my body.  

I learned to pace myself, and worked up to being able to swim for longer periods of time without breaks, to build up endurance.  

I’m still not where I’d like to be in terms of weight and strength, but I can see muscle definition where there was none, and I can swim 30 minutes without stopping.  So, while not another planet, I feel like the benefits of being lighter and more agile in the water has helped with my muscle definition."

Since then, I’ve tried to make a meal or just give food to the new parents.  When it’s the second or third child, I buy a ton of fruit and veggies at the farmers market and prep them for easy preparation.  But I **love** what your friend did!!  Good friends!"
