love,ffg7lxi,t3_etg1hm,1579900191.0,"Not how life works unfortunately. My advice, don’t obsess over someone after one conversation. Don’t obsess over anyone, period.
Fall in love. Fall peacefully in love. Not madly in love. If you really felt a genuine connection, view it as a seed you’ve just planted. Your seed will need water daily to grow into what you want it to be. Then when you feel like it’s ready, harvest it."
love,ffg77vm,t3_etgboi,1579899947.0,"If you have a crush on her and you’re close enough in your friendship for her to say these things I’d ask her out.

First however, you must ask yourself two things. Do I want to be her friend, or do I want to be her lover?

If you answered lover, ask her out.

If she rejects your advance, worst case scenario, you stop being friends and you focus your attention on someone else who may be a potential lover. If you’re lucky, she’ll not see this as awkward and you’ll continue your friendship. If you’re really lucky, you found yourself a girlfriend.

If you answered friend, keep going on with your life. 

I hope this helped!"
