Some Japanese combatants [willingly cannibalized American soldiers](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/japanese-troops-ate-flesh-of-enemies-and-civilians-1539816.html), which is a war crime. 

>JAPANESE troops practised cannibalism on enemy soldiers and civilians in the last war, sometimes cutting flesh from living captives, according to documents discovered by a Japanese academic in Australia. In most cases the motive was apparently not shortage of food, but 'to consolidate the group feeling of the troops', said Toshiyuki Tanaka yesterday in a telephone interview from Melbourne.

If Iranian soldiers did this to Americans, should the actions be highlighted as a crime? 

Should American soldiers be able to rape enemy combatants or civilians of the country we're invading without punishment? Should we weaponize the rape?

Should Americans be hiring/using/making child soldiers with impunity? 

Should the US revive chemical warfare? 

Was Hitler's intentional attacks against civilians a war crime in your eyes?

Or are those leftist stances?"
