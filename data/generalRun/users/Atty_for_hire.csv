bikecommuting,ffbta15,t1_ffbs3jp,1579781943.0,"Seriously, blinking is essential for my commute. My little side street is quite dark. I regularly need to switch from steady light to blinker after dark to have drivers notice me (pay attention). Otherwise they drive in the middle of the road, sometimes in my lane. 
And for reference I’ve got a front light, reflector, two back lights, and I wear a neon yellow coat and helmet."

lactoseintolerant,feyim52,t3_eqtd1a,1579445947.0,My wife’s GERD was significantly reduced when she realized she was lactose intolerant. Stills happens on occasion with red wine or when she’s says f-it and has dairy.
tablotv,fenavev,t3_eq2fvj,1579280742.0,I’ve got this same problem with our bedroom TV. No surround sound there. But the main tv is hooked up to surround sound. It’s a bit disappointing that Tablo forces me to choose all surround sound or none. They need to find a way to translate surround sound to no surround sound TVs.
GreatLakes,femk5sc,t3_epu2gd,1579259679.0,"Buffalo and Rochester, NY. Taxes are high, but cost of living is low. Job growth is happening in Buffalo and to a lesser extent Rochester."
HomeKit,fekgds3,t3_eplr32,1579199486.0,"Fellow Hunter fan user here. It works, but it’s not perfect. Adjusting the speed or dimming the light doesn’t always work the way it should. I regularly need to dim the light and then toggle on off to get it to react.  We also have an Amazon Echo and Alexa can’t dim the light at all, simply off or on."

cats,fegyr6x,t3_ep0uzv,1579105510.0,It’s the toughest thing in the world to lose a beloved pet. Wishing you well.
bikecommuting,fegfh8c,t3_eozr31,1579090989.0,"I added a winter studded tire to my front and it’s made such a difference. Far more confidence in conditions like these. Slows me down a bit and let’s everyone know I’m coming, but worth it."
fatbike,fegf95v,t3_ep09nt,1579090760.0,"I’m in the market for a fat bike for the same reasons. A guy I pass on the greenway and follow on Strava uses a fat bike for a 9 mile commute on unplowed cycle paths and greenways. His photos are awesome when it snows, it looks like he’s having so much fun when I’m avoiding the greenway or sliding in 700x40s with studs on the front.

Also, I assume you already found r/wintercycling? They might be of assistance as well."
cats,fefjw50,t3_eormll,1579057876.0,I’m so sorry. It’s so hard to lose our pets.

HomeKit,fe2lsw4,t1_fdzv1lv,1578840164.0,"Weird. Our Insignia has been pretty reliable. Only a few times we found it unresponsive. For the price it’s perfect to me. Now our Kwikset Premis, within 20 feet or our Apple TV has been garbage. We keep thinking about buying something different and moving the Premis to a less used door."
cats,fdyxp1p,t3_en69wh,1578784628.0,"Time. We lost our best bud on Sunday. It still sucks, but not like it did on Monday. Although it was a bit painful, we celebrated his life by looking at our pictures of him from the last 6 years. My heart goes out to you!"
DIY,fdtffql,t1_fdskvqx,1578715992.0,Second for the wood top behind the toilet.
cats,fdscs2p,t1_fds8cma,1578699666.0,"We had some oversized coffee mugs that we used for our cat as typical glasses were quickly tipped and spilled for fun. He loved water In all forms! He couldn’t muscle those over and happily drank from them. In fact he’d cut us off as we walked to them and then stand up looking at us demanding pets while he drank. God I miss that cat.
Edit: missing “off” after cut us. Very different message..."
cats,fdrql1b,t1_fdrdds5,1578688169.0,"Also, some cats benefit from having the bowls elevated a bit. So they don’t have to crouch down or over to eat."
buffalobills,fdqubmo,t3_emrh07,1578675016.0,Stop. I only be sooo erect.
aww,fdq72hq,t3_emkl3d,1578657648.0,"Senior cats have lots of love to give and receive. We recently lost our senior cat we adopted at 10 years old. He was the best cat ever, I’m pretty sure we were soul mates. We spoiled him and treated him like the king he was. Thanks for doing what you are doing!"
cats,fdpdled,t3_emk6ml,1578625931.0,Suffered the loss of our cat this week too. It’s awful. But we will both get through this. Thoughts are with you.
Rochester,fdoztlx,t3_emi9g5,1578616645.0,We just got back from King Arthur Flour in VT where we grabbed some new sourdough starter. We should have enough to share in a couple weeks. Message me if you are still looking in 2-3 weeks.
cats,fdoyoty,t3_emehq6,1578615905.0,Best wishes!
Marijuana,fdnxnpi,t3_emc441,1578594939.0,"Yes, please!"
tablotv,fdjrm6s,t1_fdhwjo1,1578484902.0,Yep the feature is enabled. Apple TV. Jeopardy is the primary recording and the commercials are all there.
tablotv,fdhh1af,t3_eld5eo,1578422474.0,We just got a tablo around Christmas and I’m on the free trial for a month of everything. The auto-commercial skip feature has worked at all for me.
HomeKit,fdcfvvq,t3_ekjflq,1578273890.0,"Absolutely. I have a garage door and a door lock. We don’t need both to run every time. Everytime I come home I get a notification that says run automation 1, run automation 2. I regularly forget which is which."
Rochester,fcyjoez,t1_fcy60q2,1578081200.0,"I’ve worked in multiple counties and the CE’s name on everything like this is unique. My business card at Monroe County has the CE’s name. My colleagues in other counties and in places I’ve worked in the past don’t have the CE’s name on things like this. Letterhead and some office and park plaques, sure. But not on everything branded Monroe County. Likely they will all be replaced. It’s a gross waste of tax payer dollars to add things like. I’m looking forward to a Bello administration, but I hope he doesn’t follow suit."
urbanfarming,fcvht5n,t3_eisekc,1578002380.0,"There are a bunch of urban farms in Buffalo you should connect with. Maybe there’s an existing outfit that suits you. The challenges of urban farming can be daunting, from land tenure, water access, nuisances and neighbors, and contamination. Best to connect and learn from others before taking it all on yourself. 

The Farmer Pirates are a collective of urban farmers on the East side. I used to work with them a little when I lived in Buffalo. 
Wilson Street Farm is also on the East Side. There are plenty more on both the East and West Sides of Buffalo. 
Good luck!"
wintercycling,fcm2me6,t1_fcm137y,1577762620.0,"Second opinion, it’s definitely a bike."
tablotv,fcj22bv,t1_fcj1dbd,1577675337.0,Thanks. UPnP was on. And based on Tablo's documentation should just work. It wasn't. So port forwarding is my next step. But the documentation is a little unclear.  Any advice other than don't use both.  Because that hasn't worked either.
bicycletouring,fcj0430,t1_fcie16x,1577673970.0,Can you elaborate on “Ignore...tread...gravel.”
tablotv,fciymne,t3_eg3lpu,1577672962.0,I just discovered I have the same issue. Disappointing.
ecobee,fc6s3qp,t1_fc6pkgw,1577488067.0,I have no comment on your comment. But as someone who is a Buffalo Bills fan and has Patrick in their name I’m envious of your user name.
bicycling,fc4dpod,t3_eg2qli,1577413687.0,"I’ve had my Topstone since May and it’s been great! I use it as my commuter, road bike, and adventure bike. It does all reasonably well."
bikecommuting,fbs9wmr,t3_ee8e0w,1577052263.0,"Seriously. I only have a 12-15 minute ride to work. I wear a dress shirt with a thin puffy jacket to keep me warm. More often than not I’m too hot. Which is funny, I was just outside in 40 degree weather hanging out in the same jacket and was cold as shit. It’s all about that activity to keep you warm."
