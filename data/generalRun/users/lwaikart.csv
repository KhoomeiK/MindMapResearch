BingeEatingDisorder,ffbrwrz,t3_esdekz,1579780386.0,"Maybe a good time to assess your overall diet and make sure you're getting adequate nutrients? 

Do you find the binges are driven by the same kind of urge but the content is the only part that's changed? ie, does the binge feel different?"
BingeEatingDisorder,ffbrn1i,t3_esifwa,1579780061.0,"Can you analyse the urge? I've noticed that my binges came in different flavors. Sometimes I was stressed out. Sometimes I was bored. Sometimes it was opportunity followed immediately by guilt that needed to be squashed. Sometimes I just really wanted something sweet/sugary. If was stressed, chewing on something/anything was helpful. It was like I was relieving tension through exercising my jaw. I opted for raw carrots instead of cabbage. If I was bored I tried to find a different way to entertain myself. If it was sweet/sugary, I honestly need to avoid such things while the urge was raging - or I would brush my teeth to try to dampen the desire for sugar. If it was an emotion driving the urge to eat something, then I'd use standard therapy skills to figure out what was going on psychologically, and see if there was a different way of meeting that need.

Is your diet/meal plan sufficient? Binges are also tied to restricting so if you're really holding back, the urge seems to be stronger than if you're not."
BingeEatingDisorder,ffbramc,t3_esn6gq,1579779636.0,"I'm so sorry you're in this dark place. You've been trying for a long time and it's understandable that you're exhausted by it all. Why keep fighting? Because there is a part of you who *knows* that you're capable of beating this and wants a different way of living. There is also a part of you who is straight terrified of what a life without bingeing would be like. It's been your comfort. The one thing you can rely on to ease everything else that sucks about your life. I was about your age when I decided to quit my ED. I chose not to do any treatment because I was too afraid of people knowing/the information screwing up my job prospects. It was a long slow road, but the most important part is knowing your why. It can just be the weight piece. It can't be that you're feeling stuck or hopeless, because the urge to binge will beat out any of those. So - why do you want to stop bingeing?

You've seen everyone that I would typically recommend going to see - did you learn any fruitful nuggets from them that do help? Did the dietitians provide meal plans to make sure you were getting adequate nutrition?"

Anorexia isn't exclusively starving yourself, it's controlling what you eat to the extent that there are physical consequences. You're experiencing hair loss, feeling tired and dizzy and yet you don't want to change you're current eating structure. That's concerning. If you still question it, seek out an assessment from someone who is trained in EDs. They'll be able to give you a better idea of how severe the ED is, if it is there and recommend treatment options.

It can be really hard to a) research therapists in your area b) work up the courage to make the initial call c) show up and d) spill your guts so I don't want that progress to be for nothing. I would tell the person, unfortunately, I wouldn't be able to continue in a therapeutic relationship with them because x reason.

EatingDisorders,ff8saty,t3_esa60t,1579694140.0,"HUG! Then take a deeeeeep breath. 

I'm so sorry you're going through this and seemingly going through it alone. It's a scary and isolating illness, but that fact that you're hitting a point of action is HUGE. Life can change.

What kind of resources DO you have in your area? Any therapists at all? 

Where are the closest ED facilities (residential/PHP/IOP)? Even if they're in another state/country, it's helpful to know what your options are.

Do you have insurance? Resources to pay for therapy? There are online therapists you can find with ED specialties.

Do you have any supports? Family? Friends? Anyone you've already confided in or someone who you think might be understanding. Enlist this person to help.

If you don't have resources available to you - and you're basically doing this on your own, know that recovery is possible that way too. There are resources online, and even free ones to help you work through it.

First step - figure out your why. Why are you done? Why do want the ED to be gone? Why have you been unable to give up the ED in the past and why are you ready to give it up now? 

Take some time and really explore what's driving the motivation now. Starting down the path to recovery can be really hard, so you need to be clear on your purpose when they days get dark. YOU CAN DO THIS!"

You want more friends and you've learned that maybe one of those barriers is how you interact with people.

First find out the specifics of what you're doing - maybe have your bf point out to you in the moment times when he feels like you're being cold/condescending. Ask him for clarification if you don't understand why something landed the way it did. 

You say you're a know-it-all and can be argumentative. Do you see ways that might be a turn off for other people? Even if you do know the answers or know that someone said something off, being corrected by others isn't particularly enjoyable. Where is the drive coming from to show that you're right?

My husband has described me as cold and aloof and I've had to really pay attention to my interactions and intentionally work on being more open and expressive. It's not easy because it's not habitual. If I know a social situation is coming up - a wedding, or going out with a group, even some sort of work interaction, I set a small goal for myself on how to interact: smile! Act interested! Be curious about other people's lives and less focused on me. Find ways that I can relate to their experience. 

As nerdy as this may sound, I'm at a place now where I really look forward to social interactions because each one is a new playing field to see if I can practice my skills and learn something new. It's fun. Good luck!"
askatherapist,ff8qil6,t3_es5u8s,1579691879.0,"You aren't alone. It seems that most parents aren't equipped to teach kids how to handle emotions because they themselves don't know how to handle emotions (Because their parents never taught them). I'm sorry you're mom isn't a great role model and that you probably missed out on hearing how great of a kid you are.

Some things to consider:

* If you're experiencing abuse, know that it's not ok and that in most places it's reportable to local authorities (Child Protective Services, for example in the US).
* You are at a particularly challenging (and exciting!) part of life. The emotional part of your brain is growing into its adult version which means you'll likely feel your emotions at more intense levels than you did when you were younger. This is normal. Emotions aren't bad, they just are.
* Start allowing yourself to feel what you feel. Some people do this via writing or some form of artwork. But take time to just be with yourself. Notice what sort of thoughts float around in your head. Notice what it physically feels like in your body (any tension? heart rate up/down, hot/cold, etc.). Do you notice yourself doing or wishing you could do anything (bouncing your foot, clenching your fists, wishing you could punch your mom)? Take in all this information and then see if you can put one over-arching emotion word to the experience. ie, I'm thinking about how annoying my mom is and how she is always yelling at me, my body feels tense and hot and I'm sweating. I want to punch something but I'm currently just pacing around in my room. This would be the experience of anger. 
* Look up an emotion wheel if you have trouble differentiating upset-sad vs upset-angry. Often times our emotions occurs in overlapping layers. While on the outside we might be feeling angry, if we dig a little deeper, we find that really we're sad, and angry at the circumstances that led us to feel sad. Or sometimes we feel multiple emotions at the same time.
* Learn more about emotions in general. Emotions have a purpose. Our bodies are telling us about whether we're living in accordance with our values. Explore what your emotions might be telling you.
* Identify ways you/your mom have typically dealt with different emotions. Then brainstorm other options. You can even ask around and find out how other people experience feelings. 

The goal is to get to a place where the behavior related to an emotion matches what the emotion is communicating, given the constraints of the environment you are in. 

I find learning about emotions to be endlessly fascinating and it's not something you learn once and then master. Good on you for wanting to start this work now!"

I think change can be threatening because it pulls us out of our comfort zone and it disrupts our relationships with everyone around us.

2) Seeking a second opinion from another qualified therapist. 

Even if you did post the results of this test, and lets say a therapist here says, ""naw, I wouldn't say you have X"", then what?

You may not relate to this, but when I was in a similar position, I read something about how considering suicide indicates that in a past life you reach a similarly challenging point in your life and chose to end it. If you choose to end your life again, you'll be reincarnated and have to face the same challenge until you figure out how to navigate it.

mentalhealth,ff2d0o1,t3_er14hs,1579501220.0,"I find this question fascinating.
First- there’s the assumption that younger generations DO have more mental health issues? Is that definitely true or is the seeming prevalence based on other variables: less stigma, more treatment options, more vocabulary about mental health, etc. Anecdotally looking at my own family I can tell you know that no one ever went to treatment or therapy but I know there were eating disorders, alcoholism, depression, and lots of trauma. Maybe the rates of mental health stuff were the same but the presentation/reactions were different. No one talked about it so there was more of an emphasis on “figure your shit out”. I think that belief in particularly is very damaging and anathema to how humans should be interacting. This western, or at the very least American ideal of independence and doing things on your own is isolative and ignores potentially useful resources. So then people turn to substances or some other externalizing behaviors to manage. 
I disagree with the idea that the world is more messed up than before. Double world wars, the depression, the Cold War, etc- I feel like that’s fairly sufficient global stress. And without the 24/7 news cycle you’d just be stuck in your own head wondering what on earth was going to happen. I do think the access to information can contribute to increased anxiety. There will always be awful things going on somewhere, just as there will always be awesome things. The news in general tends to only focus on the awful things thus playing into our brain’s tendency to prioritize the importance of such stuff.

I also wonder how much of the younger generations stuff is a result of generation trauma trickling down through the years. If you’re great grandparents survived wwi/depression era but suffered emotional scars having done so, you can bet that was passed on in some way to their kids who then with incomplete coping strategies had to deal with wwii/Cold War and got scrambled even more, passed their baggage on to their kids who do the same thing to us. 

Would love to see more research on this to see the older generations’ perspectives."

Here are two to get you started. You can dig into the references to see more. As the previous poster mentioned, “effectiveness” is something really challenging to test because there are so many variables going in to the mix. Therapy is not something that is done to you like a medication or a physical therapy session but a process that is done with you. The client/patient is a key aspect in all this as is the therapeutic relationship. 
And it would be interesting to see a study of therapist vs strong support system vs life coach vs no support vs only medication. Not everyone needs a therapist, especially if they have a strong support system already setup. And people may find more use out of a life coach depending on what their overall goals are. But you also need to be in a particular headspace to leverage those types of resources and not everyone is there."
mentalhealth,femibxr,t3_epyaf3,1579257058.0,"As a teenager I likely had depression and an eating disorder, maybe some social anxiety thrown in for good measure, but as I never sought treatment back then, I never received any official diagnosis. But because of all that stuff, I never fully learn how to process my stuff. I developed my own ways of managing emotions, and while they were no longer maladaptive, they had consequences of their own that I didn't fully see until I saw a therapist later in life.

The last time I went to an individual therapist, I felt similar to you. I was pregnant at the time and just felt flat. I wasn't scared of the pregnancy/baby, but I was concerned that I was relatively numb instead of excited. The therapist helped me work through some of the ways in which I handle emotions, how I interact within relationships and pointed out some areas in my life that I may need to adjust in order to make room for a new life. 

More recently I joined a therapy group. No one in the group had any significant/active mental illness, and instead it turned into this very rich, deep conversation about what it means to be human and how living is just hard sometimes. 

We all have these ways of living and regardless of whether those ways are good or bad, sometimes they become ingrained in us and we forget to question whether it's what we want for ourselves. When you don't have some crisis you're trying to problem solve, I see therapy as one of the mechanisms through which we can take a step back and more objectively and holistically assess what were doing in our lives, what's working, what's not working and what we want to adjust. Sometimes it take an outside party, to point out the things that we've become blind to."
mentalhealth,femhmem,t3_epy4vu,1579255993.0,"I feel you man. Life can suck. And frankly, there will probably always be things about life that can suck and you could use as a reason to quit. But just as there are reasons to quit, there are also reasons to keep going. The trick of it is that your brain is wired to look for all the shit that has gone wrong or will go wrong. And, to make things more challengings, the more a thought gets thought, the more likely that thought will get thought again. You think a thought enough times and it will become a belief that no longer gets questioned.

At some point in your history, some situation happened and the thought you had in reaction was ""I'm unlikeable/boring/ugly"". Chances are, this situations happened a long time ago when your brain was much younger and you accepted this thought as truth. But it's bullshit, or at least, there's a significant chance that it's bullshit. But when we accept random little thoughts in our head as fact, we give up our ability to see the whole picture. The question then becomes what beliefs do I WANT to have about myself. There is likely just as much evidence to support THOSE beliefs as there is about the beliefs you currently hold.

Also - being unattactive, boring and unlikeable do not make you unworthy as a *person*. I'm sure we have all interacted with people like that who still have some useful skill to bring to the table of humanity. You write well and clearly and as another poster mentioned you're probably fairly intelligent (what is it about intelligence and mental health issues??). So you're not a complete pariah on society as you sort of suggested. You haven't espoused hateful ideas about eradicating large swaths of the population and you don't seem to be particularly evil. Cool! Maybe you haven't exactly found what it was that you were ""meant"" to do for humanity, but that doesn't prvent you from going out and figuring out how to live your life that way you want to. If you don't want to be boring, find a way to be exciting. If you don't want to be unlikeable, find a way to be friendly. If you don't want to be unattractive, identify what YOU find attractive in yourself and play that shit up. This is not a game of you either have it or don't hare it.

Even then it can be a challenge cuz that little voice may pop up telling you to restrict a little bit more and pull you back to ED land.

How intense did the emotion get before you went numb? 1/10? 5/10?
So let’s say you numb out when your sadness hits a 4. Identify some things that may be in the 1-3 range, a little sad, but unlikely to trigger a shutdown. Watch a sad song or recall a sad memory and then pause to notice what happens internally. Where do your thoughts go? How does your body feel. How does even a mild sensation of sadness feel?

One session every three weeks isn’t sufficient for me right now. I want to see a therapist every week until I feel stable”. 
And no, you can make a quick assessment in 2 sessions. Maybe the practice is very full or they just have some policy where unless the person is suicidal they schedule things every 3 weeks.

The last time I was in therapy I had a lot of parent related issues I was sorting through. We talked about ways I could try to change the dynamic and when a visit approached, my therapist helped me game plan how I wanted things to go. The visit was an absolute shit show but I felt okay and was proud of how I handled things. The visit however happened organically and was not intervention style “this is how you suck ad a parent”.
If you generally like this therapist, and find you’re not able to work on what you want to work on then let her know. Maybe say something along the lines of “I agree I need to have a conversation with my dad and when a visit is coming up, I will want your help to plan for it. Right now, these are the things that are taking up brain space and that I need help addressing”
If she’s STILL stays on the dad thing then announce you plan on terminating.

Do a pro/con list of getting better. On one side, put everything that you gain from how things are now and on the other, put what you think you would gain from normal eating. Which side is longer? Which side ""weighs"" more. Sometimes the side of get better had 100 things on there but the one item on the ED side feels more important. How do the things on the list compare with your values for yourself and for your life.

Things you can do now:

* Stop calorie counting. Go for a day and see what it's like (probably anxiety provoking - that's ok)
* Ask a friend/support/dietician to tell you what to eat for a day. Eat it without making changes to it and see what it's like (hint: probably anxiety provoking, that's also ok)
* Write out a list of all the mean things your ED says to you (or if you don't ascribe to the externalized ED - the negative ED thoughts) --> now objectively look at them. Are they all 100% true? Like, based in fact, multiple people have told you similar things, true?
* Identify little tweaks you can make. Maybe you're not ready to fully give up what you're doing, but are there small behaviors you could let go of? Ie, Maybe you weigh yourself daily, could you shift it to once/week? Could you try eating a scary food item once a day?
* If you're dreading things you can't control, then you need to start pushing yourself out of your comfort zone on a regular basis to get used to the feeling (of not having control, not of dread). If you start feeling anxious about something, find a way to lean towards the anxiety, rather than push away from it.
* Start noticing the stuff you like about life and yourself now, as it is. Do you 100% hate yourself? Is there a baby toe, or maybe a freckle that you find kind of endearing? Start there. ED: ""Ugh! I hate how I look!"" You: ""That may be so but my thumb nail is looking particularly nice today"". Thoughts are like habits.

It’s unfortunate that at this point, you value her health more than she does. If you’re not going to tell her mom, you could try telling her therapist but they may be harder to reach and I wouldn’t advise putting a bunch of your GF’s health info in an email. 
So where does that leave you? You can be an emotional support for her. You can talk and ask about the ED. Not in a judge mental way, but in a curious way.

You also need to figure out your own boundaries with regard to the ED. Imagine it like a drug addiction. If your GF was a drug addict and was faking her way through rehab, how enabling would you allow yourself to be? Would you be okay with her “using” in front of you?

You learn from them and then that knowledge you gain can be applied to the next challenge you face- not in a way to make it easier, but just so that your better prepared to take it on. I recently moved across the world. There’s a lot of challenges associated with such a move, but I’ve managed, fairly well imho. My 17-yo self would have curled into the fetal position if faced with such challenges. How did I get from there to here? Life. You experience it. You learn from it. You grow. Life throws you more."
EatingDisorders,fcu3qid,t3_eiw1k9,1577971719.0,"Agreed that you’re not going to be able to do this alone. Let her mom know what she’s been sharing with you about faking it and her continued desire to lose weight. It’s basically a different, long-term version of having a suicide plan.
This is what typically happens- your GF is going to go off to college with a sick mind. She won’t be monitored, as you said, and will be able to spiral as quickly as she wants until someone, her roommate, a professor, whomever notice something is seriously awry or she passes out and is brought to the student health clinic. Maybe she passes their checks, but eventually, she will be flagged- low weight, erratic heart beat, dehydrated, whatever it may be. Her parents will have to be notified then and be faced with the decision to pull her out of school and send her into an inpatient/residential setting. She’ll likely fight them tooth and nail because of grades and academics and what not. She might try to convince that she’ll promise to eat more. Maybe they’ll let her stay if she promises to see a therapist or the school nurse. She continues to stay sick, until she spirals again and you and her parents have to go through the whole cycle again.
Alternatively, she masks the ED well but her grades take a hit and she comes home mid-term basically failing and again the conversation to leave school will happen. The timeline on this is individualized but school + ED + no motivation for recovery does not lead to success.
This cycle does not end well. College is stressful and the independence it provides is a safe haven for EDs. She shouldn’t go unless she is already well on her way to recovery or she’s just getting set up for a relapse.
This is the time for a heart to heart and tough love. Many hugs to you for being supportive and to your GF for being in so much pain.

Edit 1+2: Don’t dance around the ED. Talk straight and genuinely. You’re worried about her. You don’t want anything to happen to her. Don’t joke or play. The ED is incredibly manipulatively and defensive. She may very well feel betrayed by you but that’s okay because the priority is to make sure she gets adequate help. The problem will come when she denies the help, which is what she’s been doing. Her parents are in the unique position of being able to still implement consequences that may make her agree to help even if she doesn’t want it. Ie, you’re a minor and we get to dictate what’s happening. Or after 18, no college until you successfully pass treatment. Once she’s out of college, that window is gone and parents have a lot less leverage."
EatingDisorders,fcu2nh5,t3_eiwryk,1577970633.0,"Sorry you’re feeling this way and are stuck in the trenches right now. Deciding to WANT to change is a huge step and unfortunately often comes from a lot of pain and loss. Even so, capitalize on this feeling NOW. Motivation ebbs and flows, so while you’re still even interested in the idea of giving it up, even if you’re not ready to actually do so, start gathering resources. Grab some recovery focused books and start becoming more comfortable with the idea of recovery.
EDs are insidious and corrupt your brain into thinking about all the awful consequences of recovery. But they fail to fully acknowledge what you have to sacrifice in order to keep an ED. Give yourself a minute to sit and really do pros/cons list for recovery vs staying in the ED. And I mean REALLY do it. You say you’re afraid of the weight gain, but what does the weight piece mean for you if you’d have to give it up? Is it identity? A sense of being special or more disciplined than others? Confidence? Feeling attractive? Then flip it- what would you have to give up and continue to give up if you choose to keep going down your current path? 
Ultimately only you can decide which path is more align with the values you want for your life. I’ve both been there and worked with many people who have also stood in your shoes, trying to figure out which direction you want to head. Neither way is easy. Feel free to DM if you want more support."
Parents,fcu1b24,t3_e9iong,1577969187.0,"I did this so many times as a kid and thought I was getting one over on my dad. “Haha- I don’t have to brush my teeth! Sucker!” But now as a parent, I HOPE my kids do this- “hah! now no bedtime story or other bedtime shenanigans!” So I guess it’s win-win."
AskReddit,fcpuqoj,t1_fcpcs2x,1577872549.0,"Love this. I’m in the midst of the young years. I’m a therapist so I know all the crazy ways parents can inadvertently screw up their kids. But I’m also a parent of young ones and even when I know what the “right” answers are, as you so illustrutively describe, sometimes the situation our kids put us in make it incredibly challenging to respond like the perfect parents we aspire to be.

therapy,fco9jj1,t3_ei47rr,1577826839.0,"Step 1 of improving yourself is acknowledging that there’s room for improvement. 
Why does your brain seek out crisis? Because that’s what it’s designed to do. Your brain is designed to survive and those skills were honed during a chaotic childhood. Unfortunately a brain that’s kickass at survival isn’t so great at peace, love and joy. If you want those things you will have to be intentional and cultivate them in your life.
If therapy is too expensive, look into free/low-cost resources. There are tons of books on anxiety/trauma/anger etc. you can also find free therapy worksheets online. Look into ways of calming your nervous system down so it’s not constantly in fight/flight mode. Yoga, meditation, mindfulness, progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing, etc all help in this regard. While I imagine you have a ton of awesome traits that your boyfriend sees and enjoys, there’s also a chance his background has him wired to be the type of person who wants to support and fix other people. Maybe he likes being the guy that can reassure you and wouldn’t be as excited by a gf who would fix all of HIS problems.
Good luck! Feel free to DM me if you have more questions for where to start."
therapy,fco5peq,t1_fcnrivo,1577824577.0,"I did a quick google scan and it’s some murky waters. In Oregon it seems that sexting is more a pornography issue vs sexual abuse issue. Therapists are mandated to report suspected child abuse but not mandated to report general crimes.
I think you’re best bet would be pick a therapist and bring it up as a hypothetical either during the phone consultation or in one of your early sessions. Ie “do you consider sexting with minors something you would need to report?”"
Anxietyhelp,fcn4abz,t1_fcmwus2,1577802864.0,Fruits and veg don’t hold you over because they don’t have much energy in them and you’re used to getting more. Shredded wheat in and of itself isn’t fattening but eating only that doesn’t exactly provide your body with all the nutrients it needs. Go see a dietician and get a sense of what your body needs to sustain itself. Take an inventory of how you’re currently taking care of yourself. Weight isn’t just about calories. Are you getting adequate rest and water? Are you managing stress? Do you have relationships and activities that bring you joy? Take full stock of where you are and then identify one area that would be an easy change. Start there. I like the mantras about just trying to be 1% better than the day before. Incremental changes will leads to big results if you apply them consistently.

I’ve used them just to verbal diarrhea my thoughts, write out goals and progress towards goals, gratitude, to-do lists, etc. I’ve done goal tracking in them for several years but more recently I’m trying to make my overall goal-setting system more cohesive so the goals I’m working towards are more in line with my values and the type of person I want to grow into."

Whether the investigating authority did anything is questionable, but the therapist should report it. You could also call your states child protective agency and ask them the same question as a hypothetical and see if it’s considered reportable information."
therapy,fcn1vz5,t3_ehxg79,1577800905.0,"A new therapist won’t automatically find out about the old, but it will likely be part of your intake. From a therapist perspective it’s useful to know: what were your previous therapy goals, what progress did you make towards those goals, what strategies/interventions did you try, what worked/didn’t work in session, what did you like/didn’t like about your last therapist. You’re also not obligated to discuss any of this stuff, but you should at least acknowledge that you saw a therapist before.
It’s also really helpful to be able to contact the previous therapist and get their input on how therapy was going. This may feel like a “they’re talking about me behind my back” type of situation, but it allows new therapist to get a feel for old therapist and adjust their strategy if it was something you didn’t like."
therapy,fcn1bri,t3_ei0jcy,1577800411.0,"People leave without saying goodbye because it allows them to deny/ignore/avoid the loss associated with whatever they’re saying goodbye to. Obviously, each of the scenarios you’ve listed has a slightly different shade of avoidance. At parties, typically it’s related to not wanting to disappoint friends or deal with inevitable “what?? You’re leaving?! Nooooo don’t leave!” interaction. For the others, play out in your head what you imagine would happen if you stayed long enough to say goodbye. What would your friends, coworkers, or classmates say to you? Would they be mad? Sad? Indifferent? What would you feel in reaction? Whatever it is, that’s likely the emotion you’re trying to avoid.

I’ve moved around a lot as an adult and thus have had to say goodbye more than I’d like. For a long time I also avoided goodbyes, or just pretended it wasn’t really a goodbye and that I’d see the person again even though deep down I knew that would never really happen. Somewhere in my early 30s, I decided I didn’t want to live my life avoiding hard things. Instead I made an intentional decision to love and car for people deeply, and if I have to say goodbye, then I’m going to do it openly, acknowledging fully the loss. It’s been both more painful and more satisfying than my previous strategy."
therapy,fcmzlyj,t3_ehwjyp,1577798815.0,"A lot of focus on your body. You can’t “control” your emotions per se, but you can affect what your body is experiencing. What physical sensations do you notice in your body when you get angry? For many people, there’s a noticeable increase in heart rate, heavier breathing, you start feeling warm as blood is rushing to your body and your muscles might tense up. This is adrenaline coursing through your body, preparing you to be able to fight whatever animal has charged you. 
If you’re goal is not to attack whomever has angered you, but to instead speak rationally and calmly, you’ll need to de-escalate your body. Start with breath. Slow your breathing down by focusing on slower, longer exhales. Inhaling is associated with your sympathetic nervous system (fight/flight) whereas exhaling is associated with your parasympathetic nervous system (rest/digest). Next shift attention to your muscles. If you’re able and aware, identify those muscle groups that are tense and intentionally relax them. If you’re unsure which ones are tense, do a quick body scan/progressive muscle relaxation. Start with your feet- scrunch and tense your toes for 5 seconds, then relax. Now your calves, tense for 5 seconds relax. Etc. work your way up to your body. Clenching your kegels (the holding in pee muscle) for 10 seconds and releasing is also a good relaxer.
During whatever your encounter is, constantly assess your body for flare ups in tension. Take your time, take pauses to slow your breathing and relax your muscles, then continue with whatever you need to say. This takes practice but is a super helpful skill to have. And not just for anger-inducing confrontations.
Good luck!"
