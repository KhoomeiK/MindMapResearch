My whole life fell apart a few years ago when I suddenly lost the love of my life to illness, but meditating helped me a lot to remember to appreciate just being alive, being able to sense things, having enough food, experiencing the world around me etc. Not taking the small things for granted helped me along a long path of eventually not feeling as empty and sad all the time, and better able to cope when things are just generally shit."

AnimalsBeingBros,fc5f3em,t1_fc5b9x2,1577455736.0,"People would be surprised how easy it is. When I was going through a really hard time a couple years back, the place I moved into had a pair of robins nesting nearby. Within a couple of weeks, I would start my morning by opening my window and having my two little buddies fly inside to hang out as I made my morning coffee. They even moved their nest to right outside my window. Those little cuties really brought a lot of sunshine to my life in a dark time. They even raised a few clutches of eggs over the summer, and the babies would appear and become comfortable with handfeeding as well. 

Robins are awesome. (and because they were wild animals and lived just outside, I technically didnt break the ""no pets"" part of the lease!)

edit: also, seconding their mealworm recommendation. They go nuts for them!"

DnDGreentext,fc2q0zd,t1_fc2lj1a,1577370599.0,"I can't think of many that have unlimited spellcasting, but something like the warhammer 40k rpg ""Wrath & Glory"" or world of darkness ""Mage the Awakening"" have push-your-luck style magic systems which might interest you. You can cast as frequently and as powerfully as you want, but at the higher risks of unwanted... side effects. Side effects such as making the walls bleed or your head exploding.

I particularly recommend Wrath & Glory as I've a lot more experience with it, and found it a blast to play."
