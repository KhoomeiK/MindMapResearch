politics,ffaxxr9,t1_ffaxm3u,1579747065.0,"I listened to them for about 7 minutes... 

In that time period, they called schiff psychotic, didn’t play any audio, had 2 commercials, and insulted schiff some more. And spoke some other degrading insulting language. 

And I really was wondering how people were getting info.... that was literally revolting. People listen to that and think it’s ok? I’m not even religious and the way the guy spoke on Hannity was just disgusting. (And I swear a LOT. My 5 year old has called me a stupid asshole already)"
slp,ffaxn20,t1_ffaqj8n,1579746870.0,"Just FYI, my kiddos school (I’m not a SLP just a parent) recommends the 5 minute speedy speech as first step. I might be changing it up soon, as my kiddo looks like she needs a bit more than that but we’ll see. 

(We also do 2 hrs of private a week, and 3x a week of speedy 5 at school). It’s definitely made my kiddo self aware of her errors and while private therapy is awesome, I feel like the 5 minute speedy program is also giving great benefits. Thankfully, shes progressing. (She’s 5.5 and still testing in the 1%tile but that’s cause she’s almost 6 now). 

Also, thanks for your hard work. I try not to bother the school speech therapist much at all, since I see the private therapist 2x a week and discuss more details with her, even though they’re two different therapists... I just know the SLP at school is probably way more busy and overloaded than the private one. 

Good luck to you."

KidneyStones,ff73osq,t3_eryqq5,1579640490.0,"Cystoscopy are generally ok. They usually give you a little lidocaine or numbing gel so it isn’t THAT bad. (I’m 30F... unfortunately, I’ve had like 10+ in last 3 years plus a handful under anesthesia due to other tests). It looks scary (the tool) sure but it’s really not so bad. It’s way easier and not as painful than getting a Pap smear (personally). Everyone pain tolerance is different. 

Ureteroscopy is different. I usually only have those under anesthesia. Never had one awake. 

Stents - I’m 6 weeks into one right now. I get it out in 2 weeks. Stents sort of suck, there’s no doubt about it. The first pee hurts afterwards and there’s bloody pee. It’s not the WORST thing ever, but it sucks. Unfortunately, they help make sure you don’t get swollen shut and fall into sepsis and infections (like I previously had! I waited forever to get to doc after stone issues...) and that you can actually pass urine and stuff. Compared to stone pain, stents aren’t that bad though. The first few days will suck. After a week (with bladder spasm meds), it’s not terrible. 

Good luck!"
KidneyStones,ff57oyc,t3_erpext,1579582652.0,"30F here. Been dealing with stones for 15 years. (I too have spent many a times vomiting and not keeping anything down due to blockage... though, mine was usually severe and required 2-5 day hospital stays).

I’ll admit, I’ve never had any issues with my lady bits. (I’ll be more graphic than you, sorry. lol. I’m way too often a medical patient and have no shame anymore). 

The bladder, yes. However, I didn’t start getting UTI’s until 28 (literally. Never had one before). Kidney infections suck. 

Vaginas are weird and very temperamental. There’s all sorts that can go wrong and things that come and go and you have no idea what happened 2 days later. You grab a mirror and check yourself and all’s well or something looks wrong but it disappears by the time you visit the gyno. It could be any number of things that occurred. 

UTI’s affect everyone a little differently. Most common symptoms I don’t get. Mine are literally just the urge to pee constantly and my bladder just hurts. 

I’m mildly curious what part of your lady bits were swollen? Just in general or internal or near the clitoris or near vaginal opening? (I’m not a doc, but I have a stupid medical problem regarding a hole in my bladder that’s connected to my vagina due to a csection complication... the amount of docs I’ve seen over the past 5 years is eye rolling)"

KidneyStones,fefsh56,t3_eor13c,1579063850.0,"Tell the office to bill you. You should be able to call and rearrange payments (as 300$ a month is insane) by that method as long as it’s not copays. 

I’m like slowly declining in medical debt, but... if worst comes to worse, switch docs. 

If it’s THAT bad, ER visit. Not so bad that you can wait till tomorrow, urgent cares (Walk-ins). 

You can pile on the medical debt. Ask the office for a reasonable re-payment schedule. 390$ is a lot, depending on what you’re getting done. As long as you’re making payments, shouldn’t be an issue.

If it’s a hospital, ask for charity case or itemized billing (lots might fall off)."

It’s ultimately up to you what you do. Enjoy life now or enjoy life MORE later? 

And you can’t predict what will happen in 2-3 years. 6 months of a relationship is a relatively small period of time to gauge the rest of your life off of. You might not get married for many more years and you might have trouble conceiving. 

My suggestion would be to finish school. It’s a prime time in life to be able to do major career changes. You can still do the fun things you wanted to do after and you still plan on moving back to America. Investing in your future is always a good idea."

KidneyStones,fdzclt4,t3_enenal,1578788951.0,"Heyya! I’ve had a stent in for 4.5 weeks now. The first 2-3 days suck. But it’s manageable. 

This is my 3rd time having a stent. The first one (I was 15 or 16) sucked. I had it for a week. The second ones (had double stents) I had for 4 days and pretty much didn’t do much, they sucked. 

This one sucked for a few days. Some days it sucks more than others. A few days I’ve been A-OK. 

There’s many different types of stents. There’s softer and more flexible ones, there’s one that’s self-removable (this has a string coming out of your urethra, usually taped to your thigh), ones that aren’t self-removable, there’s ones with shorter “pigs tails” which is the top and bottom of the stent that keeps it in place in your bladder and kidney, etc. 

Your experience will vary, depending on the type of stent you get. Regardless, it sucks. But not as bad as high fevers from blockage and infection, sepsis and throwing up everything (from water to medication) within moments from blockage/swelling. Been there, done that! 

I’ve had a csection, an abdominal hysterectomy, lithotripsy, double kidney infections, stones since 15 (I’m 30 now), stents, broken bones and stitches. 

A stent is not too bad. Seriously. Get it. The first pee will hurt. You’ll probably pee blood a bit. But it’s better than dealing with hallucinations from high fevers from a blockage and infection and throwing up everything."

KidneyStones,fdesnz2,t3_ekzuin,1578345781.0,"Have you been checked for a simple UTI? Mine are exactly like that (constant need to pee and the weird bladder discomfort - almost like a dull ache). No other symptoms of uti for me, just those 2 things. And I never started getting UTI’s until I was 28. Literally, never in my life have I had them until then. 

As for kidney stone pain, if it’s blocked, there is a constant need to pee and nothing comes out. You get sharp stabby pains in the kidney area (front and back), but it comes and goes. And if it is blocked, you usually can’t keep anything down because your body can’t literally digest anything new. (I almost had sepsis last time this occurred for me). Kidney stone pain and infection are definitely a specific type of pain. 

I’ve had stones for 15 years now. UTI’s on and off for about 2 years now. (I’m 30/f). Kidney infections here and there. The only other time I had issues peeing (couldn’t pee) was after a bladder biopsy and I was peeing blood clots.

Can you put off the lithotripsy? Absolutely. The worst of it (pain-wise) is probably going to be caused by the stent anyway.  If you need to, reschedule at a time more convenient for you for work time-off. 

I’ve been dealing with stones since I was 15, and am 30 now. I’ve had stents a few times (1 week, double stent for 4 days and currently almost 4 weeks with my current one). Lithotripsy itself might put you out of work for a day or two, depending on your job. Lithotripsy and a stent might be longer cause stents are widely varied and who knows which one you end up with. Some suck and some only suck for a few days.

I used to order some codeine tablets from the UK but I haven’t in awhile. 

I’ll try the paracetamol with caffeine though! I’m almost 3 weeks in, and while it’s not terribly painful now, it still gets stabby pains here and there. And the fun bloody pee. I’ve just been taking my bladder spasms meds, muscle relaxers, ibuprofen and klonopin on a rotation to keep it at bay. 

Thanks for the tip though!"

I’m not entirely sure they exist anymore. But it’s the closest thing I knew in the Midwest/Mideast. 

I live in jersey now. 

Also, wawa is pretty awesome, haha. Also, our restroom stops are amazing!"
KidneyStones,fcj0ptq,t1_fcdzuu3,1577674393.0,"I couldn’t even get codeine this time around. I’ve had a stent in for 2+ weeks now and expected to keep it for 6 weeks. All I got was bladder spasm meds and told to take ibuprofen. Thank god I have a handful of other meds to take (muscle relaxers and some other bladder meds that are like bladder ibuprofen). 

And usually nothing but morphine touches kidney stone pain for me, but with the crack down on pain pills, it’s almost impossible to get anything here. Even during my abdominal hysterectomy in 2015, getting a refill for Percocet was extremely difficult. 

However, today was pretty pain free. My doc did give me a softer and smaller stent this time around since he knew it would be in for longer period of time. Hoping the pain stays away for me."
NoStupidQuestions,fcic1i4,t1_fci74a4,1577660335.0,"I get that. But I’m always told “this is Matt, your OR nurse”. I’ve been put under like 20+ times in the last 5 years, I’ve never had a circulator. I’ve had just a general nurse, an assistant nurse, the anesthesiologists, the doctor, and one or two other nurses introduced while I’m being prepped, but they always make it a point to introduce me to my OR nurse, specifically. They always come by before wheeling back to OR and introduce themself. Usually, they also walk with me as I’m being wheeled back."
NoStupidQuestions,fci9hze,t1_fcgn995,1577659388.0,"Aw! You’ll be fine! You’re in the best place anyway, if anything goes wrong. 

I’ve been put under like 20+ times in the last 5 years and was just put under again dec. 11. I’ve got at least 1 more to go through in the next couple of months and hopefully I’ll be all done!

It’s like a weird nap. The best nap, actually. Your brain gets turned off. It’s just nothingness. Blank. You fall asleep and then you wake up a little groggy, but slowly come fully to. 

I always talk to the nurses before hand and just chat while they’re prepping me. If you haven’t met or two yet, you get introduced. the anesthesiologist usually tells you when they’re administering stuff to get you started (And you can always ask to be kept up to date with what’s happening). They usually dose you with a small bit of anxiety meds (Valium they used on me last time), they let that get in your system for a few minutes, give you a little oxygen nose mask, hook you up to the monitoring stuff (finger clip, and like 4-5 sticky things on your chest/neck). Your doc says hi. And somewhere after that, you fall asleep. Sometimes they give you a face mask to breathe in the sleepy stuff, sometimes they don’t. If they give you a mask, you might have a weird taste in your mouth for a day or so. 

Everyone’s monitoring something on you. You’ve got like 5+ nurses/docs in the room for just you. Though, you wake up to other nurses and somewhere else. Sometimes I’m extra chatty during the wearing off phase, I’ve cried once or twice. Its usually a pleasant experience though. Even during a rough surgery (I had an abdominal hysterectomy previously), it wasn’t real bad waking up. It usually takes a bit for the pain to kick in. 

And depending on your surgery, they might hold you for awhile in recovery until you pee or poop or whatever they need from you to make sure things are fine. You’ll be given some food and drink. Longest I’ve spent in recovery was like 3 hours. On December 11, I was out within an hour or so. And they almost always HAVE to wheel you out of the hospital."

foodstamps,fcasrxx,t1_fcarw7k,1577575893.0,"Well, the note is for my husband. But he lives with us (card is for me, husband and our kid). And since he’s on the household and I have to report him as a member of the household. I’m not sure how the benefits would work out if they count him as a member but don’t take into account of he doesn’t make money. From my understanding, it would invalidate our application since he isn’t able to work nor volunteer. And disability keeps denying so, yea."
foodstamps,fcani0y,t3_egwqri,1577572769.0,"Here in jersey, they require a note from the doctor with the doctors office letterhead stating X cannot currently work. 

If I don’t get that for my spouse, he is required to show up and do volunteer work for 20 hours a week, if he is not working. Otherwise, our recertification gets denied. 

It varies by state, but I also believe the new food stamp law that was just passed is basically this exact scenario you’re dealing with. You’ll have to contact your local office and ask them what they require."
Needafriend,fc9ge7n,t3_egpc9x,1577552293.0,"Hey, so, I totally know this feeling. I see my peers back home have like marriage and 3 kids and a house and degrees and and good jobs and divorces and whatnot. 

Here’s the thing. I have one of these (1 kid). But I left “home” and these people didn’t. I went and did loads of other fun stuff that none of them did. When I left “home” my life became less dramatic. I made new friends and met people all over the world and learned things that people back home know nothing about. 

I don’t care about beach vacations (the same one every year!) to Florida, I prefer road trips and exploring new places. I may or may not ever get a degree in anything. I can’t make up my mind about it. I’m okay with never getting married, I don’t feel the need to. And I don’t ever want to buy a house because I like moving every few years. Some of the people stay in the same place cause it’s safe, emotionally and financially. They know people there and can network with ease and sometimes get handed silver spoon jobs. They’re parents know people, they’re friends parents know people. It’s easy to stay someplace because you know it’s going to be easy to get through life. 

I learned how to survive on my own, with no tribe or family to help out. I feel like when I go back home, they’re all trapped in this little bubble that is just an ongoing continuation of high school (13 years ago). There’s baby daddy/mom drama. There’s family drama. They’re on Facebook showing perfect little lives. But I feel pretty ok with my life. I’m in medical debt to my eyeballs. My credit score sucks. Right now, I have the ocean in my backyard. I used to work for a restaurant that was on food network loads of time. I have a very weird job that I do from home that pays my outrageous rent most the time. Got diagnosed bipolar (and more fun stuff). I’ve had troubles but I’ve also experienced some cool shit (like New Years ball drop, Christmas in nyc, deep ocean fishing, etc). 

But I spread my little wings and flew away from the nest. My parents love visiting because I’m in a cool location for tourist spots (jersey shore, philly, DC and NYC are all within 2 hours of me). I’ve been gone from “home” for almost a decade now. 

I’ll most likely never be rich, and I’m okay with that. I’ll eventually get to financially comfortable at some point. But I definitely thought at 30, I’d have some stuff under control... and I don’t! Right now, my only goal is to pay my bills and keep my kiddo alive and well and get a 5 year long medical injury corrected (hopefully soon!). After that, I’ll worry about the rest of my life."
