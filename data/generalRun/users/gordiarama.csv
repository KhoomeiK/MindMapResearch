TheMarvelousMrsMaisel,ff4fgqw,t1_ff42564,1579562344.0,"It was definitely a catalyst for Susie’s character growth! So much going on in Susies life—juggling both clients, really coming into her own with utilizing the smarts she’s always had, getting herself into the financial trouble with the gambling, losing her mother and using the house as a means to get out off that, humbling herself to go to Joel for help, and other things I’m sure I’m forgetting! She comes from nothing and is flawed and trying to figure it all out. Poor decisions, but she’s trying to get it figured out. I’m worried she will get in trouble for the fire fraud, and what will the thugs ask of her when her favor is redeemed."

harrypotter,fecoq6y,t1_fecem4g,1578979333.0,"We did too! Several differences we noticed between the parks as well. Disney’s fast pass is a clunky process, Universal’s express is much smoother, U has the “singles” line that you can get so quickly into rides. After going to Universal, the rides and animatronics at Magic Kingdom seemed so out of date. Disney needs to invest in that park to update things. Tomorrowland is what the future was thought to be back in the 70’s. And other comparisons we made. (We still love Epcot) Disney is still magical but it’s losing its shine, imo."

Seeing a character dressed as Snape whipping his robe around would be pretty fun to see. We also thought about the fact that Captain America doesn’t wear a mask, yet they have him there."

oddlysatisfying,fcsmqaj,t1_fcrvntg,1577919862.0,I’d post a pic of my pantry but it would reveal my horrible failure at keeping things organized. And then stuff gets pushed to the back and goes stale and gets wasted. and I think there might be a small child lost in the middle shelf but hasn’t asked for his mom cause he’s busy eating cereal. Not my child.

oddlysatisfying,fcr0tok,t3_eiitd1,1577895091.0,I have a serious question because I’ve tried to do this on a smaller scale and failed. What does she do when she has more quantity of an item than what fits in there? Does she have multiple containers or a larger bin that holds excess of any items that don’t fit in the bins? I’d love to get to this scale of organization but I’m a sucker for buying quantity when there’s a good sale on an item. This is wonderful.
