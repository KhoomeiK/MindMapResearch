SuicideWatch,fd6u147,t3_e8z1i7,1578195702.0,How come your wife left you??
SuicideWatch,fd2j1dx,t1_fd2gr1w,1578147936.0,Thank you so much for sharing your purpose. It is really rare chance to know other people’s purpose to live because I can’t say “hi! What makes you live today?” to people. I should find a purpose to live too. It might be visiting other countries...?? still thinking.
SuicideWatch,fd2dqu7,t1_fd294zd,1578145750.0,I really agree. It seems that most people are conformist and I am the only one complaining. Thank you for assuring that I am not alone.  You just made me cry.;-/
SuicideWatch,fd2cghj,t1_fd2aeby,1578145217.0,"Thank you. The trauma flashes back more often than before somehow and is getting worse so that’s why I think it is pretty hard to heal. Although if I could find a good and affordable therapist, the situation could be better. Yes, I will try to believe that there is more to bring me happiness in this world."
SuicideWatch,fd27l8k,t1_fd25ssf,1578142940.0,I see. Focusing myself must bet the key to be less suicidal. I am 30yo Asian woman and feel some kind of pressure both at work and personal life.. I will try not to listen what people I don’t care say.
SuicideWatch,fd21094,t1_fd1ko7e,1578139970.0,Therapy is not affordable for me plus there’s no free therapy here in Tokyo as far as I know.. Thank you so much for the comment!!
SuicideWatch,fd19n55,t1_fd176cn,1578128905.0,That’s so true. Thank you for your honest response. I am curious person so it would be really nice to look forward to see how fucked up the world is and what happens next.
SuicideWatch,fd0wnpy,t1_fd0ushf,1578124771.0,"Absolutely.. Thank you so much for saying that. It helps a lot. Yes, I am out of the situation."
SuicideWatch,fd0uc63,t1_fd0tiak,1578123866.0,I have been abused by my father and nobody saved me. Also I have been bullied by managers.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fbzrkw5,t3_cp195g,1577257912.0,So it means he literally wrote my report??
