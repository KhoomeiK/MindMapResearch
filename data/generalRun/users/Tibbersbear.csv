breakingmom,ffxytjb,t1_ffxcxr8,1580335103.0,I'm not sure and I don't know how to figure out how to ask. Our suburb doesn't have a Facebook page. The nextdoor app is dead. No one seems to want to communicate around me. All my close neighbors have very small children and the oldest are probably 12.
breakingmom,ffxyjxd,t1_ffxhb43,1580334951.0,"Thank you. We have named his toys. He has five we usually hide and make him find them. We've also been doing some new training, but he just wants outside. He loves being outdoors all the time. I think it's because my parents have ten acres of land and when we visit he can roam mostly free. He was spoiled for a year when I lived back home. 

He loves being outside and since we live in the suburbs and our yard isn't that big, he gets bored. Even when we play or do some type of training, stimulation inside, he'll stalk the window and if someone walls by with their dog, he runs to me and starts begging for walks. I'm so heartbroken for him. I want to be able to give him everything."
babyloss,ffwqw7i,t3_evkqtj,1580308827.0,"Definitely valid. My mil did something similar. I don't have a great relationship with her either. She's caused me so much pain and suffering throughout my marriage to my husband (a even before). My husband somewhat understands why I don't like her. He's not completely on my side, but not on hers either. He knows how effing crazy she can be. 

She had said some things that she shouldn't have. She's an idiot though (putting it as nicely as possible...but she literally has no brain...) and my husband will look over some stuff she says because he truly believes she doesn't mean it in a bad way. She just doesn't know what she says... because she's...brainless. Like a child kinda I guess. She did say the ""it happens for a reason"" bullshit and I cried and my mom told her that wasn't a good thing to say and explained why. But she showed her true colors at my brother in law's wedding. 

She and my bil's new mom in law were talking. My bil and his wife are older than us, childless, and very busy successful people. The mils were talking grandkids and my mil said ""I think I'm only going to have the one (talking about my stepdaughter). I don't think (my brother-in-law) wants kids. *Rolls eyes and sighs* and I don't think I'll get another from (my husband)."" Meanwhile I'm sitting RIGHT NEXT TO HER. She knew we were waiting for a bit to allow me to heal mentally and physically. She knew we wanted to try again. We had been trying for three years when our daughter was born still. She knew. She's not as dumb as she acts. She puts on that act to say what she wants without consequences. She knows how to play everyone, but me. That's why she has this agenda to hurt me.

I told my husband later that night so I didn't ruin the mood for him because he hadn't seen his brother in awhile. I just poured myself another glass of margarita and went outside for a breath of fresh air. I kept my distance from her the rest of the day. But since we were leaving the next day she stayed at the hotel with us so we could all go to the airport together. And I couldn't do it anymore. 

I cried and told my husband what was going on. I told him I wasn't going to be able to talk to her anymore. I have been no contact with her since. She gets all her info from my husband (and it's very very very little). But he still thought ""she doesn't realize what she says. She's not the smartest person."" But she knew what she was saying. She knows what she says and always has. 

You need to sit down and have a serious talk with your husband. His mom definitely did something wrong and he shouldn't argue with you about it. He wasn't there and he wasn't in your position. I don't want my mil to have anything to do with my new baby. My husband is reprehensive to not allowing her in our son's life. I seriously don't want her to be around me after he's born and I don't want her to speak to him when he gets older. She's ruined my relationship with my stepdaughter. She's said things that have hurt me and even though EVERYONE thinks she's just a dumb person, and doesn't realize what she says, I know that it's all a facade. 

Sit down. Tell your husband to listen. To not be offended. That you're not trying to come off as critical. That you need him to try and see all sides. Tell him exactly how she has made you feel. Starting from the first time she made you feel terrible. Tell him to just listen to you and try to understand your feelings. 

You both went through some traumatic stuff. You don't need more complications. He may not feel as strongly as you about the loss. My husband is convinced that I suffered more than him. He's pretty protective of me and my emotions when it comes to his crazy family. But you need to talk together before trying. You need to set boundaries for yourself. You need to establish rules for your pregnancy and make sure that everyone, not just your mil, follows them. Pregnancy after loss is a whole different thing. It's super emotional. 

Also follow r/Pregnancyafterloss once you do become pregnant. Everyone over there is super duper supportive and I love the sub. r/Justnomil is okay...but I would take everything that people say on there with a grain of salt. They can be overly dramatic... and with sensitive situations like this I don't think they'd be the best support network.

Sorry I made this sooooo loooong....I just know what you're going through...."
YouShouldKnow,ffwnoqn,t1_ffwetcf,1580306459.0,"Check engine lights and beeps my car makes give me so much anxiety because of my '99 beetle. The cooling system was f'ed and it would overheat. We replaced everything but anytime I drove it long distances something went wrong. 

Then on my '05 trailblazer we had a similar problem, but we ended up fixing it. But that beep or seeing the temp gauge slowly rise.... The trailblazer also had a misfiring cylinder quite a few times but we replaced what needed to be replaced and it's still kicking. Probably one of the best cars we've owned. 

Sorry I don't have advice for a '04 Sonata. But as for any car, just keep up with maintenance. Don't always do oil changes or simple maintenance yourself because a shop will tell you if something needs attention. Pay attention to sounds and smells too. We had a tube that was leaking a little coolant last summer and you could only tell because of the slight sweet smell coming from it. But I picked up on it fast because of my beetle....(it would literally spray coolant...I can tell if any car near me is leaking even a bit of coolant...)"

Like, ""oh fuck me, sorry I have a kid to care for too. I can't throw everything away for your shit paying job.""

Most places that *should* be easier to get jobs at as a mom, think all high and mighty of themselves and want all your time like it's the most important job ever. I had a job literally tell me they couldn't hire me because I had a kid who was only in morning Pre-K and I only wanted a part time position. I applied for a part time position, I went into the interview expecting to be interviewing for a part time position, but last second they change? Ugh. 

Then, having a large gap between jobs? All because you had a kid, or couldn't find a job because you're a mom....it's ridiculous. 

I've been a stay at home mom since my husband and I got married (because he has a kid). The worst trouble I had trying to find a job was in Colorado Springs. Target didn't want me because I said I had a kid and needed certain times. Three different Targets I applied for. Barnes and Noble lied about needing part time cashiers. Walmart thought I didn't have enough **experience**(????). The last place I worked at was a Dollar General and they didn't have any near me. I mean out of the many areas in Colorado Springs I should have been able to find a job. 

It became a hassle...I had two job interviews every week. I interviewed at every ""entry"" level job on monster. I went to my local army community center for help to get a job (they helped sahp get jobs) and the only bull available was MLM shit. Three years I tried. I broke so much. My husband and I didn't have the money for me not to work. He made me feel useless at the time (we almost split and went to therapy and he realized I gave up my life to raise **his** kid)

We moved and luckily I got a job at the apartment complex I lived at (he went overseas). I was just a receptionist and only worked like four hours a day (it was usually very empty in the office and I could bring the work phone to my apartment and if someone needed in the office I would get a call). 

When we moved again it was to a big area. I got scammed by an ""advertising"" company that turned out to be a MLM but on a whole 'nother level. 

Then I worked a shitty job where they wouldn't give me my hours but would call me and tell at me for not coming in. 

The job market is fucked up and I hate it. I'm totally okay with being a SAHM for now. My husband has an amazing job... even if I don't bring anything to the table, I do more than he does. I clean house, I take the kid to school, help her with school work. I budget, organize bills, make sure things are paid on time or organize the days they are paid. I take care of him and make sure we have everything we need. When I'm sick or gone, nothing gets done. If I weren't here all he'll would break loose."

quityourbullshit,ffo5ceb,t3_eu8yv6,1580074355.0,"My husband's ex was like this. She neglected my stepdaughter and had CPS called on her by her neighbors. She would lock her in a room when she had her (usually during the week) and she had turned the doorknob out so the lock was outside, claiming that it ""helped make sure she (daughter) didn't lock herself in"". 

She had also locked her in a room once and was downstairs smoking with two people (she claimed it was cigarettes, we think differently) when her neighbor looked across the hall and saw her front door open. She called out and walked inside to hear my stepdaughter crying inside the locked room. That was the first time CPS was called. 

She wouldn't change her diapers, my husband and I had a hard time potty training her because her mother wouldn't do it. It was awful. My husband began to fight for full custody and she slandered him all over Facebook and then kidnapped their daughter. It was awful. 

I was with him through the whole thing. The worst part? They were both teenage parents. He had to wait until he was 18 to begin the process of getting custody. It would have taken a long time if she didn't decide to leave the state and cut everyone off. She still claimed he ""stole"" her baby from her. That he was the one who called CPS and lied to law enforcement. He never wanted conflict. He just wanted his daughter. 

There's also records of doctors appointments where his mom had to get daughter from birth mom and take her for rashes. And an emergency room visit from daughter cutting her finger open on a knife that was left out. CPS did another investigation and saw the state of her house. Messy, dog shit everywhere, dirty diapers on the floor, over flowing trash. And when the social worker was there birth mom just sat in her room on her phone and poor daughter was running around in a diaper down to her knees... She brought all that on herself but blamed my husband and I and my husband's mom. She tried to fight it in court too. But we had photo evidence of her negligence... and a notebook filled with notes on days things happened. Saved phone calls and texts. Got doctors notes and files....my husband made sure he got everything. The court ruled in his favor. 

He got full custody because she didn't show up. She only got supervised visits in public places. 

My stepdaughter is 10 now. We've been together for 9 years and married for 7. I've helped him with everything and helped her with her trauma. She had gone through some hard stuff as a baby....she was non verbal for two years. She wasn't fully potty trained until she was four. She still has trouble with certain things. But I'm here for her and always will be. 

Her mother has come to terms that she will never have her in her life. She sometimes talks to her. She saw her a few times during the summer. But that's it. We're okay with that. She's my daughter, she calls me mom. She calls her birth mom by her first name. I've raised her into the awesome kid she is now."
