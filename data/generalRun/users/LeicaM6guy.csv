It’s easy to turn that argument on its head. It would be much easier to produce replicas from, well, replica Mausers. By his own admission, it’s not even an entirely accurate replica (most notably, the flash hider is further out. The original weapon had the barrel cut down.)"

Leica,ffm5x84,t3_eu6m8v,1580049088.0,"First, Leica never produced cameras specifically labeled for military use - and certainly nothing with snake skin. The Luftwaffe and rest of the German military tended to use off the shelf civilian models, though a few were etched with service-specific serial numbers. 

Second, there’s an entire cottage industry in Russia and Former Soviet Union states geared towards churning out fake Leica and Contax cameras. Given that early Zorki and Kiev cameras were essentially part for part copies of Leica and Contax rangefinders, this wasn’t particularly hard to do. Lots of these fakes are sold as”Nazi” cameras, complete with service logos and swastikas. 

These are worth maybe twenty or thirty buck, though personally I wouldn’t want one. Who’d want to walk around with a camera with a swastika on it?

So yeah. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but your camera is as fake as a three dollar bill."

First, the video is extremely low resolution, which you see in a lot of fake videos to hide flaws. Second, there's zero prop wash when it comes in for a landing, even when it's coming in over tall grass and loose dirt. Third, when it lands the movements are artificially smooth and there's a sort of bounce to it that you don't see in regular aircraft, even when they're empty.
