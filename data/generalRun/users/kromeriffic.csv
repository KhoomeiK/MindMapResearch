insaneparents,ff3i5y6,t3_erg4ej,1579541552.0,"My mum is studying to be a counsellor, so she uses all that kind of language against me. It's horrible to watch."
JUSTNOMIL,ff3hxt0,t3_ergalj,1579541414.0,"I think sitting back and letting it wash over you is a good strategy, just be blank and boring for your mum.

So it might go something like this-

Mum: This trip is going to be awful! You're going to have a terrible time! It's going to be such a failure that I am going to try to convince you to stay here! (Ie, where you are a captive audience for her negativity. How convenient.)

You: Ok.

Mum: but I need to list all the ways it will go wrong!

You: Ok. (Meanwhile plan in your head all the cool things you can do on your trip)

Without an emotional response to latch on, your mum will be thrown. It might be funny to watch, but I think the main aim is to save your energy while you work on moving out. I hope you're working towards that? I don't think your mum's behaviour is going to change.

Good luck, have an awesome trip with your boyfriend."
JUSTNOMIL,fdms2q0,t3_em2yxa,1578562984.0,"It is ok to grieve for the loss of the idealised, decent parent that you should have had. 

Please be gentle with yourself, but she is trying to provoke you into replying to her. She's hoping that you'll go running back, apologising for the big mistake you made by ""being disrespectful"" - ie. standing up for yourself as an adult.

My feeling is that she will keep contacting you, because she can't cope without the pellets of attention you've been dispensing, but if she does actually go silent: go ahead and enjoy the sweet, sweet gift of her silence. 

And go kick ass at college! Good luck x"
AmItheAsshole,fdatp7e,t3_ekf5ol,1578250016.0,"NTA, I think this is one of those ""apply your own oxygen mask first before helping others,"" situations. 

Keep contact with your sibling, provide a model of what respect and love can be, and take care of yourself. Especially because, if you choose to medically transition you may be in danger from your parents as time goes on and they notice your voice breaking, etc. Good luck."
bulletjournal,fcslawc,t3_eiobep,1577918927.0,"Personally, I think there's no way to do bullet journaling wrong, so long as it helps you. Everyone has different needs and abilities to keep up with a notebook, so there's no point forcing yourself into a system that doesn't work for you.

If you're finding community and inspiration in the bujo community, welcome!"
bulletjournal,fcsl2y3,t3_eioe9x,1577918784.0,"I write in a stream-of-consciousness way, starting with what's bothering me and going from there. Sometimes things pop up that help me adjust, sometimes I remind myself of my end goals (and why the current difficulties will lead to long-term success, etc)...you may be surprised at what occurs to you when you start writing.

I basically use my notebook as a private therapist, haha (disclaimer: I have seen various different therapists for a decade and have a good toolbox for my mental health. If you need professional help, go to a professional)

I hope this helps spark some ideas? Writing down your feelings and struggles may not give a quick fix or an ""a-ha!"" moment, but the practice of paying attention to your thoughts and feelings will pay off."
bulletjournal,fck2jih,t3_ehkk13,1577714650.0,"I make a point of putting my bloopers on IG, because it's so easy to find inspiration (and slight intimidation, haha), and I want to balance that out a bit."
