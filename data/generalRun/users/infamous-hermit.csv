 They are so stupid that forget that if you follow a common decency and living rule, everything is going to be easy for everyone.
Wait in a queue.
Going in one direction, returning in the other.
Don't block the exits.
Don't scream unless necessary.
Help now, you will get help later."

I feel that some people is just resentful, and dismiss everything human because cannot connect and have relationships in their lives. They cannot help it, for them everything is black and white. 
They see one person doing bad things, and all human beings are evil, ignoring that there is always someone who will try to do good.
Other people see the individuals as that: individuals. And their contempt is against the society, rules and practices.
Other people, see the humans and their societies with contempt, but know that always are exceptions to the rules."

Is not like they're free, but they are not paying for them neither.

In my office I have a food bank, when someone forget their food and cannot buy something (noodles, canned food). 

The rule is they don't have to pay it right away, but they need to bring something similar as soon as possible.
