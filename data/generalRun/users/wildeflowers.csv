BeautyBoxes,ff6iqyl,t1_ff6gyb7,1579628072.0,"Interesting. I ended up getting a bottle for free so it was not risk to try it, and I really like it. I have dry skin though so maybe that's it. It just melts off my makeup and when I emulsify it rinses away so well. I was surprised because I had avoided trying it for so long thinking it must be overhyped. I was using the Illyoon before which is very similar to the sulwhasoo, but they discontinued it. :-/"
BeautyBoxes,ff6ikee,t1_ff6h7up,1579627961.0,"honestly, people want that shit so much I feel like you should be able to trade it for more than sultry, but yeah. I hear you. If I wanted it, I'd buy it from you, but I don't. 🤣🤷‍♀️ Sorry, lol."
BeautyBoxes,ff6h3mg,t1_ff6gu6s,1579627064.0,"thank goodness, I guess. I'm positive you'd be able to trade the blue blood for an ABH, but you'd probably do better just selling that palette on mercari and buying what you want since his stuff is in such high demand from his fans. Sorry though, because that's another annoying task."
BeautyBoxes,ff6gvsn,t3_erwr11,1579626930.0,"man you are the lucky one. I'd be pretty happy with this bag if they hadn't snatched the Xl out of my cart as my CC was processing, but seeing all the other options, maybe I am the lucky one, ha."
BeautyBoxes,ff6gt8w,t1_ff6bw4p,1579626885.0,"yeah, that sulwhasoo oil is the bomb, but have you tried DHC. I can't believe I put off trying that for so damn long, and it is just as good as sulwhasoo for less than half the price. Doesn't make me feel as bougie though. 🤣"
BeautyBoxes,ff6gm53,t1_ff6fic5,1579626764.0,"oof this surprises me more than the lackluster items. If you have a specific brand lucky bag, it makes zero sense to have those products in the normal lucky bag, since you can put the other inventory you're placing in the regular bags, but you can't put non Jeffrey star items in those bags. Unless they had more Jeffrey star assigned to boxes than they sold of his bags, but yeah. 

Was this an xl?"
BeautyBoxes,ff4mawv,t1_ff4cbe9,1579567061.0,"I had the XL in my cart and it sold out while my card was processing, and I debated about getting a regular and decided against it. At this point, I'm not mad about missing out. 

I really should just get myself a ND palette next time Sephora does a little sale. I got the mini tropic in the trend mood box and holy heck her formula is just as impressive as the other few shades I have. I just need to make the investment. I like Viseart, but the formula doesn't work quite as well for me as ND, so yeah, it makes sense to just get what I want directly. You're right a $150 gamble is huge."
BeautyBoxes,ff42yko,t1_ff40vxw,1579554403.0,"Yes, the XL I've seen have been nice, maybe kind of boring but nice. IDK if I would have been completely satisfied myself unless I was one of the lucky ones who got the large ND, but none of the regular lucky bags have really appealed to me. Not that most don't have the value, just not items I'm particularly wanting, but that's the risk.

I saw some XL bags that had the Viseart Tryst. While a nice palette, considering it's been sold regularly for around $20 I would have been slightly disappointed if that was my big item, as well. Maybe I'm on BB overkill, but the lucky bags seem kind of lackluster this year."
BeautyBoxes,ff3wcmu,t1_ff3sv67,1579550281.0,"And that one bag was an XL. I was checking out when the XL was taken out of my cart, and elected not to get a regular. I'm thankful at this point."
BeautyBoxes,ff3w29l,t3_eridcv,1579550104.0,"I got one in allure a long time ago, but it was clear. It's not my favorite formula, but it's not terrible either. It's a little sticky/goopy. If you like the colors, it's probably worth trying. IDK how much you'd get either selling or trading. They don't seem wildly popular.

My package started leaking and I had to throw it away before I fully used it, and that was a little disappointing to me."
BeautyBoxes,ff3ujhf,t1_ff3uajn,1579549155.0,"lol well that is weird. The ""mystery"" items in my account correlated to the items I got, but yours apparently didn't. So odd.

This isn't a complete lucky bag, and I really think somebody just messed up. I'm sure they will do something for you. I know they're out of lucky bags, but hopefully they'll be able to send you something else or maybe refund or offer you a credit for the price you paid because this is whack."
BeautyBoxes,ff3ov9b,t1_ff3o30p,1579545676.0,"I don't think this is ""for"" kids per se. Sugarpill is well regarded indie brand, and this was a collab with the Sanrio label, but it does read *very* junior. I'd buy the heck out of a hello kitty sugar pill palette though, no lie."
BeautyBoxes,ff3opru,t1_ff3nsnp,1579545583.0,"Wait, this was the only thing in your box? Are you kidding?

This has to be a mistake. I'd contact them with that sort of assumption. ""Hey, Beautylish, just got my lucky bag and I think I got someone else's order by mistake?"" There's no way this could be a real lucky bag."
BeautyBoxes,ff3n95g,t1_ff3emay,1579544683.0,"I would ask for a replacement item. I guess it makes sense on a technicality, but lord, if feels like they are talking out of both sides of their mouths. They're constantly telling us how much ""value"" we're getting, but when they send a defective product, the ""value"" they offer you is $4.61. Ipsy, get a grip. Either it's ""worth"" retail or it's worth less than 5 bucks. (My money is on 5 bucks, lol).

I'd ask for an equivalent item. Not the retail value, not another whole box, but I'd ask them to send an item that was similar in value. That's probably the most fair resolution."
videos,ff1v5uw,t1_ff1ty9p,1579486887.0,"Right, as a musician I had a real appreciation for organists, and I think that's why I was so annoyed. They honestly had an amazing instrument and I knew what it could do. I tried explaining that just because I also pushed keys that looked the same, that absolutely did *not* mean I could actually play an organ, or use the foot pedals or knew one dang thing all those switches and buttons did. I was annoyed that I was basically strongarmed into playing this thing, and they didn't want me to use the piano right next to it instead. If that happened to me today, I'd tell people like this to go pound sand, but of course, I was a meeker teen at the time. When I went to college, I could have studied the organ but I was so turned off by the whole thing I wouldn't touch it. 

I think they were just cheap and assumed they could force a kid to play instead of paying a substitute while they were looking for a new organist. If I remember correctly, the old one quit, which is a real surprise right."

My parents church decided when I was in high school that I should play their organ for them (for free of course) since I was a pianist. No amount of me explaining to them that I was *not* an organist helped, and I was forced to play the damn thing. I ended up only using part of it because it was impossible for me to use it for its full extent. I had literally never had a lesson on an organ in my life. I was disappointed in myself, but I literally had no interest in becoming an organist. Man fuck those people."
BeautyBoxes,ff1k1ry,t1_ff1itvo,1579480432.0,"oh yeah. All of their powders are so finely milled. Yes, it's expensive, but I feel like the price gets you consistency. I have the ambient ghost palette from this holiday season and it has a bronzer, two finishing powders, one of those is luminous, two blushes, one cool one warm, and a highlighter. Every single item in that palette is insane. The finishing powders have this quality that makes you look airbrushed, and the bronzer isn't overly warm/orange. I put off buying this for so long because it's stupidly expensive, but I have no regrets. They're a great company I think.

Only downside is they get some fair criticism for not making enough shades for deep tones. They brought back the ambient palette edit that was for deeper tones, and it sold out instantly which is a bummer."

BeautyBoxes,ff16rpu,t1_ff0ixx0,1579475792.0,"Fair enough. I don't have an issue with them manufacturing their own products if they are good quality, though that is not exactly why I sub to a beauty box. I can see how it's not a detriment depending on what you're looking to get out of a beauty box sub. Where I have an issue is with them obfuscating the fact that they are Ipsy produced and manufactured, and creating websites that deliberately leave out their origin and/or inflating the retail value to make the bags look like they are ""worth"" more. 

I don't mind rec"
BeautyBoxes,ff0bjhw,t1_ff0a51r,1579467261.0,"yeah, I agree Ipsy seems very unfocused at this time. Of course, so does Boxy, though I think think the box itself is going pretty well. I'm so surprised Boxy has better salaries, because their employees seem so unprofessional and sometimes incompetent (look at those boxy live events)."
MUAontheCheap,ff06etd,t1_fevtt5m,1579465695.0,MUFE ultra HD foundation is incredible. I hate that they are not CF though.

* Pros: Price is amazing, and formulas are generally excellent. They're eyeshadows are some of my favorites. I love the ultra glossy lips. 

* Cons: CS is pretty terrible. Some of the packaging/applicators are not great. For example, as much as I love the ultra glossy lips, the applicators are terrible. 

Not budget: Hourglass for powders and highlighters, Natasha Denona and MUFE for pro quality shadow

* Pros: quality is insane

* Cons: the only one Imo is price, maybe packaging on the multi pan hourglass products. It's a little harder to use a fluffy brush with those."
BeautyBoxes,fezjqy8,t3_equ2ff,1579458062.0,"Keep in mind that Ipsy's CEO is a former WalMart exec and expect more changes coming as they look to make Ipsy even more profitable. I've read an article where Ipsy makes significantly more money from shopper than they do from the subscriptions, and that they are focusing on manufacturing their own products and brands. This explains all the Ipsy made collab items, including the Gigi stuff, the brushes, and the licensing of other brands name. As a consumer, I don't really care for this and I didn't appreciate the tricky website for their Counter Culture brushes that tried to obscure they were an Ipsy made product. However, I did love plus when it came out and hope to get it again at some point. 
 
I personally feel like Boxy has been able to offer more known brands over the last year or so and are focused on the beauty box market in a completely different way. See the data mining, etc. I don't suspect they are focusing too much on add ons and pop up as a profit making venture. If they are, the constant failure to handle that side of the business professionally is not good."

BeautyBoxes,fezgloe,t1_feydlca,1579457140.0,"packaging is often changed for sub boxes, and they could have filled the wrong package with the wrong product. It happens sometimes. It's hard to imagine but it's more likely in a small company like this. It looks exactly like the scrub so it's possible. 

And honestly I suspect that brands pawn off errors like this to sub boxes, though I'm not saying it was done on purpose here. Suspiciously, there have been quite a few filling errors caught by people from various brands in sub boxes. Most people who get these won't notice and they still get to try the product so it seems a great way to get rid of good product that can't be sold at retail."

You get to pick 3 categories if you sub seasonally and then FFF picks the rest. If you sub annually, you get to pick a few more categories (still not all), but I personally don't feel like it's worth paying full price for the boxes. I like this box, but I generally don't feel like FFFs are ""worth"" 50 bucks, at least not to me, so I haven't gotten one in over a year.

BeautyBoxes,fewp4oo,t1_fewnwle,1579417372.0,"Yes I’m very happy with it. Honestly the notebook isn’t a bad selection in that category, at least imo. 

I don’t think my skin is very sensitive, but it’s extremely dry so I have to layer, layer, layer. The only thing I’ve reacted to recently is the avant hyaluronic moisturizer from boxy. At first I thought I loved it but then it started to burn when I used it. It has a pretty heavy scent but I’m not sure if that’s what’s bothering me. I’m trying to use it but it’s not going that well. Otherwise I’m just careful about acids since I am using retin A. I guess delicate is more accurate than sensitive? 

I refuse to upgrade to a select membership. I haven’t gotten a fff since summer 18? Whichever one had the foreo. They also regularly do the 40% off flash sales so I don’t know why I’d pay $50 when I know if it’s a box I want I can get a coupon to get it for 30 or 40. The extra choice isn’t enough incentive for me. I do get most boxes in that way though. If spoilers aren’t interesting enough I cancel or pause.

BeautyBoxes,fevblqt,t3_eqp89m,1579395441.0,"So my FFF winter edit just showed up, despite the fact that my account still shows ""preparing for shipment"". Ok, that's cool, and I feel like I won the lottery. I used the 40% off coupon so got the box for just over $30 with tax. Feels like a score.

Kate Somerville Goat's Milk Cream: my pick. I just started tretinoin back up so I'm going through moisturizers like nobody's business so this is very welcome. I've sampled this before, and while I think it's overpriced at retail, it's nicely hydrating and will def help having another moisturizer I know doesn't bug my skin around.

Grown Alchemist Bundle: my pick. I actually really like this hand cream, so this was one of the reason I decided to grab this box. People seem to either love or hate this hand cream, but it's a love for me. It's not greasy and has a light natural citrus scent. I haven't tried the mask. It's clay and that's a big fat no for my skin, so I need to gift or trade. It's a lovely product though. 

Burn 60 resistance bands: my pick. This category didn't have too much I was interested in, a lot of costume jewelry makeup I wasn't super interested in, so I elected for the bands because I need some anyway for pilates. They'll get used, but I didn't realize there was only one full loop band, the other two are apparently just strips. They're fine and actually useful, so cool.

Doctor Rogers restore healing balm: FFF pick. It's a blend of castor oil and glycerin, so very simple and clean. I ain't mad about it. I can actually use this and is probably the item I would have picked in this category. 

Cela Creme de la Creme: FFF pick. I'm seeing a trend here. I've heard great things about this cream, and have I mentioned I'm dry as a bone. This box may have annoyed someone else, but I'm thinking \^SEND \^ALL \^THE \^CREAMS \^PLEASE! I'm into it. I also avoided the ubiquitous free people eye mask, yay! 

Rene Furterer Hair mask: FFF pick. I \*love\* this hair mask. It smells amazing and leaves my hair silky soft. I got a tube of it from Beautyfix a long time ago and ran out recently. I am so happy to get this again, as it's pricey and I'm loathe to buy this outright. 

Blaq Cleansing Wipes: FFF pick. Probably my least favorite item, but at least they are useful. My daughter will probably enjoy these.

Invisibobble set: FFF pick. Sweet, my puppy just chewed up two invisibobbles and I'm down to my last two that I can find. I am ecstatic to receive these because I think $10 for 2 round phone cords is ridiculous. 

Spogelle Freesia Pear: add on Like so many others, I love a spongelle, and freesia is one of my favorite scents. $5 add on, yes please. 

I am just pleased as punch with this box. There's only one item (the mask) that isn't going to work for me and that isn't because it's not a great item, it is, and I really picked it myself, but I do love that hand cream."
BeautyBoxes,fev8rb0,t1_feu6o9a,1579394448.0,"I suppose you can get by without a scale, as mercari estimates for you, but it's helpful because sometimes it's hard to tell, and personally I'd rather charge/pay for accurate shipping."
GoRVing,fet70pq,t1_fesju8c,1579372367.0,"Yes, good deals can happen at shows, but it depends on a few factors in my experience. You'll have the best luck if you're buying a model that isn't super common. We got a very good deal on a custom A, and paid about the same as late model used were going for (1-2 years old). We were satisfied. 

Could we have saved more by getting an around 5 year old one? Yeah, but I would have probably had to sacrifice some options that I really wanted to get, and it wasn't *that* much different. This is for a relatively high quality A with fewer units produced so they hold their value a little better. It's a little harder to get a deal like this on trailers, probably easier on high quality 5th wheels."

I'd also say that the middle range As are also pretty good, like Tiffin and Newmar (jury's out since Newmar just got sold). They're not a Prevost, but they're also not an ACE. I'm kind of the opinion that pretty much all RVs are kind of a pita, but it's easier to repair a higher quality rv than a cheap toothpick and plastic one."
BeautyBoxes,fengpto,t3_eq3nzq,1579284317.0,"Plus was my ride or die through August last year. My algorithm seemed to work and I always got boxes with products that were relevant to me. Of course, there were duds here and there or products I was initially interested in that weren't as great as I had expected, but for $25, it was awesome to try products I was interested in for the equivalent of $5 each.

It started to go downhill for me the month before premium was launched. I got a nail polish in plus, the same size and brand that was in the regular bag the month before. They started spoiling things like tube lip balm and sheet masks, which are also items that were in the regular bag often. I personally was not interested in products like this and it isn't why I subscribed to plus. After ultimate was launched, and the first few ultimates were horrible as well, Plus tanked, and I haven't gotten it for 7 months now. I keep pausing it in hopes the spoil some items I'm actually interested in, but so far no dice. I think this month was actually getting better again, but it's still not interesting enough for me.

If you don't have a large collection, and you like the spoiled items, yeah, I think plus is a good deal. They algorithm worked for me, but I know it doesn't work as well for others. The nice thing about ipsy is that you can pause any month before the end of the month if you don't like the spoilers, so you're not committed to getting it."

I signed up for the waitlist initially the day it opened. Took myself off because I wasn't too interested in Nov., put myself back on the waitlist for premium mid nov. Cancelled my base box at the 11th hour on Nov 29. I noticed my waitlist was still active for premium, but I decided it didn't matter, if I got premium or not it would be fine either way. I got an email the next day that I was activated for premium. 

So they are clearly not going in order of signups because my wishy washy ass got it."

personalfinance,fela8bx,t1_fekpn40,1579217464.0,"This is PF, where the common advice is to buy a 10 year old beater and drive it until it falls apart. That's fine advice if you are living paycheck to paycheck, trying to pay off debt or have other financial challenges.

However, I personally value having a trustworthy, low mileage car with newer safety features, and I can afford to purchase one.

So my advice to OP would be, if you can take the $5900 and buy a new car with cash, or very minimal payments, and you have good steady work and are meeting your other financial goals, then it makes sense to have a newer car that doesn't have a salvaged title. If you have any financial challenges at all, it makes more sense to take the money and car and get liability insurance. 

So paying cash for a car or financing being a better deal is really dependent on someone's financial landscape. For *most* it's much better to not have a car payment. The only people for whom it really is *better* to take a loan out are people who have investments outperforming the cost of the financing."

That said, maybe they will help her with an exception, but my university would not have. The bursar would have told me I was an adult and should have known enough to find out directly from their office, not some random other employee that doesn't handle finances or accounts at the school. 

Is it also possible she misunderstood the professor and that he said she wouldn't lose much *more* than she was already going to lose and that he was trying to encourage her to work through the issues and stay in school. What else was he supposed to do? Tell her to quit? No one in his position would have advised her to do that.

He was mistaken, but her mistake was not advocating for herself and getting confirmation of the policy from the people that could definitely answer that question."
BeautyBoxes,fel6g5k,t1_fel1ne2,1579215071.0,"You can cancel base as soon as you put yourself on the waitlist for premium, but I think that you will be charged and receive the base box the month you sign up. You don't have to stay subbed to base to continue being on the waitlist though.

There's a lot of confusion about this because Boxy initially said you had to have base to be on the waitlist, but that was true for the first month. Now you can cancel base and wait for your spot for premium. Conspiracy theorists (self included, lol) think maybe if you cancel base, you are more likely to get activated for premium. That's what happened to me."
BeautyBoxes,feke26j,t1_fekb7hj,1579198105.0,"they probably did. Honestly, the board of directors is probably desperately trying to save the brand and convinced her or forced her out. Of course, she got paid. It's her name on the label.

BeautyBoxes,fekdfv1,t1_fekbryh,1579197729.0,"Yes, I'm aware that ultimate includes four samples. I'm specifically talking about plus though which is 5 full size. 

I guess technically nail polish, lip balm, and a sheet mask are ""full sized"", but they are really just scraping by on that techicality. They've been putting those types of items in the regular Ipsy bag since the beginning, and in Ultimate they're also counting those as full size, not as the smaller items. So IMO, people rightly felt a little duped. 

I got a nail polish, same size and brand as they put in the regular bag the month before in my plus even before they launched ultimate. I kind of side eyed it when it came, but then more items like that started appearing. That's not really what I'm looking for in plus so I've paused it for months. I keep hoping plus will go back to being amazing, but I haven't been tempted yet."
videos,fekavbp,t1_fek9tkc,1579196211.0,"Ok, but I'm going to put a spoiler tag on it for those that don't want to read it. Warning: this story is graphic, painful, and involves a civilian young woman. Please only click to read this if you are sure you want to hear horrible things that involve our own troops.

>!I knew an older man who was a WWII veteran when I was young. He volunteered for an organization I worked at. I'm not sure if I reminded him of the young woman in this story, or if he knew he was getting older and needed to tell this story that burdened him so horribly.
It was near the end of the war, and a group of soldiers were moving through the countryside of France. They came across a young woman. None of them spoke French, but the young woman was clearly starving and all alone. The group of young soldiers grabbed her and forced her into a nearby barn. She was raped by those men, and then they killed her. They left her body in that barn and moved on. The vet that told me this story said that he was not a participant, but he felt such sorrow and guilt over this. Was he a participant and this was the part of the story that was too much to even confess? I don't know. I just know that at the end of the war, a young women lost her life for no reason. Men who had been marched through horrors I can't even imagine for months and years, lost their minds and did something horrific, and the man I knew lived with shame that he didn't or couldn't help her for the rest of his life. We were supposed to be the good guys. For that young women, we weren't. I'm sure she wasn't the only one.!<"

I had a WWII vet confide a story to me about something that happened during the war in France. I'm not sure if he needed a confession, or if I reminded him of the girl in his story, but I'm probably the only person on earth that knows what happened to an anonymous French girl in the countryside at the end of WWII. It's a heavy burden for me, and I didn't even go through it or anything like that ever. 

How can anyone ever justify war?"
BeautyBoxes,fek5uxs,t1_fejt0uj,1579193244.0,"honestly, you're exactly right about boxy, and I readily admit I am part of the problem. I swore they'd never get me back, yet here I am happily subbed to premium. They do constantly screw up, and the people who'll down vote anyone for saying it must be boxy stans or have their head in the sand. It's everything from little things, like charging people $5 for the add on shippping, to big things like false advertising and the complete cluster of the pop up sales. Yeah, they do fix the little things, but they'd spend a lot less time scrambling and upsetting people if they even tried to be semi professional. That said, I do feel like they've stepped up a bit with the products.

Ipsy plus was awesome, until they started ultimate and I wasn't enthused when they started putting in base products in the plus, like nail polish and sheet masks. I do think the algorithm worked great for me and they did send me products that were relevant. I'm hoping plus comes back strong this year and I can come back to it."

Based on what you guys are saying though, it doesn't sound great. I don't want ""influencer"" brands. I absolutely do not want KVD. I don't want lifestyle items in Premium either. If I did, I'd get FFF or luxe. The hair straightener is already borderline for me and I'm only getting Feb. because two other spoiled items make the box for me. 

I really like what premium has been since Dec. I've gotten good products that I actually would have purchased, and enough of them that even the items I don't like I can happily pass along to others and not feel like it wasn't ""worth it"". I'm hoping that this would be just testing items and that they wouldn't put a box together with multiples of the same item, or reduce the item number to 5.

And yeah, I don't follow boxy on Insta, but I will look at their posts when someone links them or the spoilers come out. Suva? IDK, it's a bunch of imported stuff. Is it high end? No. Will it be better than a $5 straightener? I'm sure it'll be fine. I have the mini one they sent out a year ago, and it works well enough and is decent quality.

BeautyBoxes,feegmyc,t1_feeekdy,1579033357.0,"Agree to disagree with the spoiler thing. If Boxy releases spoilers and specifically says, ""you will receive *this* OR *that*"" then we should get one or the other, not some random third product. If they say, you ""may receive one of these items"", then yeah, having a few other products in the choice for that item is fair. Verbiage matters in advertising, if it's not accurate it's false advertising and I have a problem with that. They've also said in the past that certain items will be something everyone gets for the month, then surprise, it's actually a variation as well. It just teaches me to not trust anything that boxy says.

BeautyBoxes,fee9zou,t1_fee8d48,1579029460.0,"I agree with that. I feel badly for those that are still waiting. They said the order thing on Insta. 

I'm just mostly intrigued because of the way it went for me personally. I signed up when it was announced, not immediately when it opened but probably within an hour or so. I took myself off the waitlist because I didn't care for the Nov. spoilers. I put myself back *on* the waitlist mid Nov. That obviously didn't put me at the bottom of the waitlist because I got premium Dec. 1 and other people have been on the waitlist, not taking themselves off since day 1. So that had me wondering about those who already have premium if they go to the bottom of the waitlist when they cancel. I mean that would make sense, but nothing boxy does makes sense."
BeautyBoxes,fee73r1,t1_fee5l53,1579027761.0,"yep that's what I did. I noticed when I cancelled base on Nov. 29 that it didn't remove me from the waitlist. I just shrugged and let it ride. Dec. 1 they moved me to premium. How convenient, lol, but yeah a lot of people were rightfully confused by that based on how boxy worded it initially. I was low key hoping to get it so didn't mind. What irks me is they ""say"" they go by order of signups, but we're all not stupid, and that's so clearly not true. I don't think they'll ever tell us the how or why of it, but they annoy their customers with the shenanigans. Doesn't make sense to me, but whatever. 

What I'm wondering is if you already have premium, if you cancel it, and then decide to get it again, if you aren't waitlisted because you already had a ""place"". It seems like it works that way for luxe. Agree that it's probably not worth experimenting if you really do want to keep premium at this point, but I'm really curious."
