PublicFreakout,ffqyl9s,t3_euo422,1580146555.0,Is it irrational to think that the rate of return from ride pics would be higher for theme parks if they lowered the price from the outrageous $30-$40 to like...$10? I know there are some people that ARE willing to pay that much but there's no way that price is based on any reasonable supply&demand model.
marvelmemes,fffo2ap,t1_fff0o3p,1579888101.0,"I think Strange is definitely the most powerful in the MCU thus far; maybe Scarlet Witch is the exception, but her powers are still pretty limited to what she's able to physically manipulate in her environment. Whereas Strange is tapping into other worlds and dimensions. I don't think they're nerfing his powers so much as his philosophy. His philosophy in the films is to be the **ABSOLUTE** last resort and only intervene when it is totally necessary.

The only times it has looked like he's needed to put in a decent amount of effort is with other sorcerers or other-dimensional beings. Even when Loki was threatening him in Ragnarok, he didn't appear phased at all. His 1v1 with Thanos was likely just a stall until Tony got back to the fight. He was doing pretty well for himself given the fact that he went up against a multi-infinity-stone-wielding titan. There's also that shot of him taking out like 20 baddies at once in Endgame like it was child's play.

Maybe we'll get a glimpse of his *full* potential in MoM"

psychology,fee3407,t3_eojuqp,1579025399.0,"I'm not really sure what they're actually challenging about the statement - **Self-control equals sacrificing pleasure**. Maybe in the short-term, sure. But if there's no incentive of sacrificing short-term pleasure for long-term pleasure then self-control wouldn't even be necessary in the first place.

>But, as the authors of *Exerting Self-Control \[does not equal\] Sacrificing Pleasure* argue, for a choice to constitute a self-controle failure, it must be accompanied by anticipated regret and violate a long-term goal held by the consumer...

This is pretty much the only statement in the article that I would agree with. It's pretty standard; and I would further argue that this anticipation could be either conscious OR subconscious. 

>""If the same person ate only a small piece of cake, however, they may not experience a self-control failure because they haven't eaten enough to violate their goal of losing weight and trigger regret.""

Well, no shit...When you're already tempted to do something, it doesn't take much rationalization to convince you. It seems this study focused primarily on food consumption and healthy dieting decisions but the general idea that's being implied is quite dangerous: *""*It's not THAT unhealthy if just have a *smaller* slice. Therefore if I eat the smaller slice vs. the healthier carrot, I won't feel bad about myself later."" How people feel about the validity of their decision is hard to measure objectively. People pre/post-rationalize their behavior all the time in order to avoid cognitive dissonance.

If a cigarette smoker rationalized that just having one cigarette in the evening instead of two was ""healthier"" then there's clearly a lack of self-control within the smoker and as a result he/she will still feel satisfaction after a few puffs. Now, obviously sugary foods like chocolate cake aren't *physiologically* addictive like tobacco, but it's the same principle.  In other words, yes - the smoker is satisfied due to a lack of self-control like the study would challenge...but that's exactly what makes self-control so important."

Not to mention, both those terms sound like they could mean two different things. If they're measuring it by the participants' self-reports, then that just means that psychadelic drugs result in people *perceiving* an increase in connectivity with nature.

The MCU had to convince us. Disney saw the potential of Feige's plan for Marvel and took advantage of it. By 2012, the MCU was only kind of a big deal. They were releasing like one film on average per year...kinda testing the waters. The first Avengers movie was the big litmus test to see if people were even interested in interconnected storylines. If it bombed like Justice League they probably would've stopped there. 

With such a successful and beloved franchise like Star Wars, the new trilogy didn't need to be groundbreaking like the MCU. It just needed to be ""good enough"" and it would make an easy few billion dollars for them in ticket sales, merchandise, and spin-offs. I would find it hard to believe that the films were made because someone was *passionate* about the story they cooked up."
