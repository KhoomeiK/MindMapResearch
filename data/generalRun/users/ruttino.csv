NonZeroDay,ffnsw3e,t3_euboq7,1580070352.0,"Great. The tree idea, is a beautiful one and it is correllated to growth.

My only suggestion is that since you won't offer (I guess) periodical benefits (new things) the subscription model doesn't fit well. I don't know if new articles could justify paying a monthly fee (to me it doesn't, but market could prove me wrong).

If you'd like to go forward with this type of pricing, try to take a look at ""Mindshine"" app, I think they nailed it when it comes to the subscription model."

It is enough for you to catch the moment when you're mean to yourself, and then to switch the bad statement into a good one. Instead of saying ""I wasted all my life on videogames"" say ""I have a lot of experience in gaming, so I could do that to make money"".

This self praising should not be used to justify the bad behaviour, but instead should be used to cultivate the good behavior.

That means that you should act on the good statement that you just said. So, instead of returning to the PC/Console, you could search for ways to monetize your experience (e.g. Streaming/YT videos/walkthroughts/tutorials/teaching kids to become good at games).

That doesn't mean that you should stop playing, but you should be careful that what you do takes you closer to your goals. 

And I think you're not that old to have wasted ALL your life on videogames, the best is ahead. 

Stay hard my friend."

festivals,fdndd38,t3_emax7f,1578583387.0,"It depends on the festival, the bigger it is, the more expensive artists they can book. I'd say approx 1/3 of the production costs.

So for example, a festival with production costs of €1.5 mil will have approx. €500k from that in artists related costs (booking fees, agency fees, hotel, meals, flights, chafffeur, ecc).

But it really depends on the festival. Take that as a rule of thumb."
AskBalkans,fdkrxgy,t1_fdkok9c,1578509893.0,"Please send me a document, map or book written prior to 1800 which confirms that the name ""Romanian Country"" existed during Vlad's rule and I will admit my ignorance on the subject.

For what concerns the ""Russification"", please note that our people wrote in cyrillic all along until Romanian occupation in 1918 and during soviet era 

Take a look at Stefan's sword, the inscriptions are in cyrillic.

Russians are de facto controlling a piece of our small land, and that's something that bothers me more than anyone else, but we cannot do anything about it yet. 

Regarding discrimination, I saw it directly multiple times from those from Romanians who want union, that's why I mention it. Jokes are jokes :)

And trust me, Russians are more discriminatory at us than anyone else. 

Moldova should be an independent ethno-state, friendly with Russia, Romania and anyone else, but independent from them."
AskBalkans,fdkb26h,t1_fdjxvcu,1578500095.0,"Stefan was Moldovan, and in a few occasions he fought Wallachians and other West carpathian populations. 

Maybe he is not happy about the current situation, as neither I am, but surely he wasn't happy about the romanian occupation too.

He was for a free Moldova and gave his life for it.

Russia has nothing to do with this. I'm not ""russian"" because I don't agree to a unity with another country where Moldovans would be discriminated (as romanian Moldovans already are). Mine is only patriotism as I love my country as everyone should. 

It's a shame that politicians are fucking up this bad since 1991. 

But this should not be an excuse to give up our independence.

I was able to make changes in my life only after I understood this. 

Too often blogs, gurus and authors don't mention this because they're only focused on selling you the ""latest hypertransformational motivescion"" bullshit, and they just say to people to ""wake up at 0500, go to gym, go for a run, meditate, work on your startup, then go to your 9-5"" like it should be the most natural thing in the world, but it isn't. 

Natural is something that maintains the status quo, and you need to ***consistently break*** ***it*** in order to achieve your goals.

You must sacrifice your comfort and win your demons. And that's not a ""natural"" task. 

But you keep beating up and treating yourself as a ""piece of malfunctioning equipment"" because you ""did not lose 10kgs in 2 weeks"" and you did not ""invent the new iPhone"". Instead of doing things from a positive POV (e.g. I want to go for a run because this will help me have a nice body, good health and confidence), you're doing them from a negative one (e.g. I must go for a run because otherwise I'm a fat lazy pig).

This puts an enormous pressure and anxiety, because you don't see the small victories, but instead criticize yourself to the point that you stop doing what you do just to avoid this stress.

Hey, even if you lost 1kg, that's still progress. And even if you did not invent the new iPhone, but only made a draft in paint, that's still progress.

You must accept yourself, and by that I mean that you have to love yourself, have a positive self-dialogue and incourage yourself no matter your situation.

***Don't be your tyrant, be your mentor.***

Don't rush, don't understimate the effort and time required, and give yourself the permission to fail.

Start with small steps, and you will see things will start come together as you wish."
