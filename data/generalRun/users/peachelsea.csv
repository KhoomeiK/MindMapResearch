As automation and artificial intelligence softwares become more prevalent, the need for a greater, specialized in-depth understanding of specific aspects of a platform or service dies out. This isn’t just true for marketing, but so many other industries, too. 

If you don’t believe me, you should read these articles from a couple reputable marketing blogs:

https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/en-us/blog/the-impact-of-automation-on-digital-marketing-jobs

https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/jobs-artificial-intelligence-will-replace

I particularly like this line: “The best way to fend off the robots is to determine the skills and traits that are irreplaceable, hone in on them, and improve upon them whenever you can.”

This one is kind of a fun one in that it shows the limitations of AI, but still the importance of understanding what it means for certain jobs: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/14/can-a-machine-learn-to-write-for-the-new-yorker

There are more articles out there, of course, but the point is that certain aspects of jobs are being replaced. Meaning, marketers need to expand the skills they do know, and make sure they’re “future-proof.” In the case of a Google SEM Specialist, the skills that would give them that specialist title are the skills artificial intelligence or automation could take care of.

And, if you still don’t believe it, that’s fine. Your complacency and adamant resistance to change will leave more jobs open for those that want to grow and thrive."
marketing,fedhxyk,t1_fecdxx7,1579011982.0,"Concerning your confusion on specialization, (as one example) things like Google SEM Specialist positions are dying out. With that being said, positions such as UX Designers are in higher demand. But, clearly the OP isn’t a designer, so that didn’t apply here.

The trend in marketing is to broaden your skill base. Not to know everything, but know as much as possible within your sector of marketing."
marketing,fe9uc0q,t3_eo6lsp,1578941508.0,"Companies that aren’t an agency or don’t have a designated marketing team will try to consolidate 10 jobs into 1. This sounds like one of those instances.

Yes, specialization is dying, but (in my opinion) you should not be expected to be a designer, copywriter, content creator, media buyer, PR coordinator, social media manager, and more all under the title “Marketing Director.” It’s unrealistic and ineffective. And, while I realize not every company can afford a full team, it’s okay to enlist offsite help from time-to-time.

Edit: You should understand these skills for the sake of team communication and the ability to construct a well-planned strategy. But, you should not have to become these roles completely.

I will agree that it’s always good to have more skills, but my caution is to not spread yourself too thin.

Best of luck to those on the job hunt!"

digital_marketing,fdnv70v,t1_fdno37n,1578593504.0,"I don’t know if I’d include it in the resume, but I think as a separate thing it could maybe work then! This could be something good to bring up during an interview as well. When they ask “What do you bring to the table?” (or something of that sort) talk about what you bring to THEIR company, not just the skills that could benefit anyone. Make it specific.

Just make sure to phrase things positively and don’t completely tear down what they’re already doing. For instance, instead of saying “Your social media targeting needs some work” say something like “With deeper evaluation of your company, goals, and target market, I can help you develop a strong, intentional marketing plan that targets higher quality audiences for your brand online.” Just spin it so that it’s a positive for both of you.

Also, I appreciate you taking everyone’s criticism about your original idea so well. I think that kind of attitude will really help you in such a competitive industry like marketing."
digital_marketing,fdnkogp,t3_emam85,1578587811.0,"No, definitely don’t. It looks desperate, honestly.

Also, everyone should be reading books about their craft. It’s really not anything to boast about. And, if anything, it just gives the interviewer more things to poke at if you thought a book was worthwhile and they didn’t. 

However, certifications, diplomas, experience, and evidence supporting that you know what you’re doing (ROI metrics, performance reports, Etc.) are very much worth sharing. You could read all the books in the world and easily be a copycat marketer without any innovation or creativity. Display your own work, not someone else’s (like their book). That’s the most effective!

Good luck!"
