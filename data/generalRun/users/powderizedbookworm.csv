Engineering gets thrown in there too these days. Basically everything where the terminal degree is a Doctorate of Philosophy. That’s a pretty big area to keep your kids from.

And I guess I don’t see why you’d keep your kids from English literature or music or something. My sister has a degree in sociology (she claims she mostly focused on alpine skiing in college though, but her sociology degree was from all the random classes she found interesting), and she made about triple at thirty what I do now at thirty with my PhD in Chemistry. I suspect she’ll maintain something like that margin for the rest of our lives, because she’s about as competent as I am, and *much* more fun and interesting. It’s not what you know, it’s who you know; more than that it’s knowing who to know, and who to ask for help, and how to work hard when necessary and back off when it isn’t. Much easier to learn that last one when the whole thing isn’t just one unmitigated force-march of “because I have to.”

In my experience, the people who learned the courage and vulnerability associated with chasing a passion are perfectly capable when they are out in situations were success depends on doing what you are supposed. On the other hand, the people who got used to always doing what they were supposed to can’t usually answer the bell when they have an opportunity that requires courage, passion, and vulnerability."
AskReddit,ffk540o,t1_ffixplg,1580016154.0,"In this case, Remember that your moods cannot be controlled by Today You, but this is because they reflect Forever You. This is not the same thing as constantly waiting for Godot…I mean the sun. Today You is a brushstroke, Forever You is the painting.

Forever You might have all kinda of issues, fears, and unresolved hurts that Today You can’t do a damn thing about. In this sense, Forever You might seem like a real asshole, but Forever You understands at some level that while *one* beautiful sunny day is a glorious joy, 365 of them in a row is a drought. Finally, the way you react to the weather is the life you make, not the weather itself.

For once I’m out of sappy metaphors, so let me just speak plainly; negative emotions are important for a rich life, but this only happens if you *engage* with them. You can’t be always waiting for a sunny day, because while the rainy ones can be shitty, they have purpose. They are *not* just to be endured, and if you treat them as such you will get what you want; life as an endurance test against your own deep emotions. I don’t know anybody who wants this.

If you find yourself gloomy all the time, you might just be a melancholy person. This is *not* the same thing as being depressed, and it’s not the same as being depressing (I, for one, fucking *hate* this cult of cheerfulness).

The person you are today might have some issues with the person you *are*, but that’s just life and growth. If you keep fighting this reaction, you will train yourself to hate yourself in a circular fashion."
AskReddit,ffk45w7,t1_ffk2414,1580015273.0,"I definitely read your comment, and I didn’t really take any offense with it, I just think we have had different experiences with science. I really don’t think that there’s any such thing as irrefutable progress in science; insofar as there is, at the five year scale of a PhD, making any progress at all is as much a matter of luck as scientific acumen. I was lucky. I was also *good* (still am, for the most part), but it was probably more important that I was lucky. In this sense, the bullshittery quotient for a science PhD is at least as high on average as it is for people with a PhD in Late-Shogun Era Japanese Warrior Poetry, or what-have-you.

I also think you might be using “aesthetics” to mean a certain amount of showy flashiness. Let me be clear that I am using the term to denote the simple beauty of effective design, which I maintain is more fundamental and important to good technical work than technical brilliance is.

Semi-related, I’m generally down on Rationalism. The kindest thing I’ll say is that it’s the worst way of gleaning truth from the universe except for all the others."
AskReddit,ffk3e6v,t1_ffjup8y,1580014578.0,"The PhD thing just straight up isn’t for everyone. I wouldn’t say that it requires a mental disorder, but that’s just because I’ve learned to stop thinking of things like ADHD and mild bipolar as disorders. My PhD cost me a great deal personally, but I think it was worth it. If it fucked up my life irrevocably (and it well may have), it did so so thoroughly that I can’t even imagine an alternative.

I will say that I think the secondhand perspective of your wife’s situation is in many ways dead on, and in other ways very skewed. Your observations about the ludicrous competitiveness as a be-all-end-all and constant dick measuring are on, but they are all a bit biased by perspective.

You are correct in one sense about the “dismal rewards”: the people you are watching are not being rewarded in the way you would like to. University professors doing research aren’t paid great and have a very demanding job. What they *do* have is nearly unlimited power over their students, which is intoxicating to a certain subset of people. In my experience, a slight majority of PIs are absolute bastards with a god complex, a decent number are pleasant people who just love unfettered science and don’t care about money, and another decent number like science and love helping young people become scientists.

The reality is that PIs hold the power they do over their students *because* the field is fairly lucrative. Industry is going to be seen as a “lesser” option by the academics because it isn’t professional dick measuring, but it’s generally lower stress and good pay. I went to a good, but not particularly prestigious institution. Becoming a tenure-track professor wasn’t guaranteed, but it *could* be done for people from certain labs, probably including mine (“probably” is a very long story in this case). Of my dozenish labmates, who were almost all tremendously capable people, none of us had the faintest interest in academia. This made our PI somewhat sad, but it’s also fairly normal.

Your friend doing the post-doc might well go into industry later. It’s not uncommon at all for companies to hire people who’ve done a post-doc straight into what would be equivalent to a VP level position at a bank. It’s less common to hire a PhD without a post-doc into something like that, but hardly unheard of.

For me personally: I’m 30 and *completely* out of piss-and-vinegar for my life. I’m perpetually single, at least in part due to the prickly intensity that the PhD years instilled me with. I’m very much hurt by the loneliness, but it’s still better than being in a shitty relationship. I only make about $50k/yr at my main job, but I’ve got fairly lucrative side gigs that are easier to pull off with the degree. Additionally, unlike a postdoc, my current job is an absolute peach, with a nice amount of challenge and almost no stress, in a *great* location, with fantastic colleagues.

I won some and I lost some with the PhD; I’ll put it that way."
AskReddit,ffk1k4w,t1_ffjup2m,1580012986.0,"I do disagree with much of this.

For one thing, a science PhD is a Liberal Arts degree; the Ph stands for “philosophy after all. In the more colloquial use of the word, let me just say that I’m very grateful that my science colleagues had some writing classes, and I’m glad that the people in management and marketing I’ve had to communicate with have had some science.

In my experience with professors in science, the godlike power they get to hold over their graduate students is a big part of the appeal, and so politics was a *huge* part of getting a PhD for everyone I was close with. I’d say that the quality of the scientists who finished their PhD was higher than those that didn’t; but I can think of a number of people who didn’t graduate who were better scientists, but worse at politics, than those who did.

In the humanities, my instinct (I don’t know all that many of these people) is that the professors don’t really care that much about what their students get up to, which puts the students on a bit of an island. A too-demanding professor in the humanities doesn’t have the power to deny their students access to a lucrative career, unlike in science. I wouldn’t hire one as a Research Scientist, but I still have a lot of respect for the people who help frame our conversation about Art, Culture, and Aesthetics.

The other thing is that aesthetics is just as important as good experimental design. It is *possible* to outsource figure-making to someone who is bad at science. In practice though, the person designing the research is best equipped to make the explanatory figures, and if they have bad compositional or aesthetic sense, they will fail to some degree at communicating their work to anyone else; which means they fail at science. In most situations, it’s better to be OK at the science and good at graphic design rather than excellent at science and good at graphic design."
