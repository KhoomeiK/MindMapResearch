If every part of that whole simply tried a little bit, that would be a huge impact. And that's the point.

Small changes like the ones I listed may not seem like much for one person but they accumulate immensely if the whole population does them. Feeling like you have to do the things you listed only causes inaction. Start of small. That's the best thing you can do. And then spread the ways you've reduced spending to others. Corporations will want to make money at the end of the day. If they're not molding their business around your life, than they're not making money.

Imagine if all those millions of people found out that together they are extremely powerful and influential on companies. You dont have to reach out to any one of those millions of people to be strong together, just do it yourself and trust that if you will do something to better our position, so will millions of others. Our problem as a society is that we lack the common will to do some things. Small changes on a personal scale make for great changes on a global scale. If you really care and aren't involved in the conversation simply because you feel attacked, than doing something small for the betterment of the world today. Than do it again every day.

worldnews,fessilc,t1_fesceqg,1579368573.0,"You're naive if you cant accept partial responsibility. As one person, YOURE not to blame. But if everyone decided to stop consuming as much and demanded change to happen there would be change on a global scale. But that's not reasonable. You cant wait for everyone to change for you to follow suit. So unless you're not already doing something about it personally and regardless of others influence on you knowing this, yes you are partially to blame. A very very very small part, but a part of a whole nonetheless. It's like not voting. Yes, your particular input out of the whole doesnt matter. But if everyone felt the way you did, it would make a huge impact. When you decide not to do anything about it, so have a million other people. Dont be part of the millions that decide not to do anything about it. Climate change is more realistically a ""will I or won't I"" war within ourselves than it is politics or what have you. As a population we have direct influence on what companies do. You are a part of that population. You do hold responsibility. It may be small, but you cant underestimate how harmful your opinion on not being responsible is."

You either have to assume the guy on the left was either an absolute idiot, or a person slightly above average intelligence with decent acting chops. I think betting on somebody as well spoken as him being a bit more intelligent than average would've been a safe bet.

 He obviously bluffed, in fact he over played his hand by holding the box. He did a great job acting, poor job at an actual bluff. A great bluff leaves an air of mystery, this one was blatant. The guy in the right is the actual moron, it turns out. Because it would take an actual moron to assume the guy on the left is a moron. 

You can tell because he says if this is a bluff, you're a genius. A single bluff isnt genius, a double or triple if he could pull it off might warrant that reaction. In fact the harder question would be whether the guy on the left is bluffing or double bluffing. If the guy on the left wasn't so superflously acting, I would suspect he might be double bluffing, but he made his intentions clear at some point with his overacting. He was just single bluffing.
