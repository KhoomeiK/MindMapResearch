A long lonely walk to the bus as well. So obviously I didn’t try it. It’s a real shame because it must put so many people off going, especially women and those, like me, who can’t drive. So I have managed myself, with support from here. Ups and downs all the way. An ups day today ! IWNDWYT"

I still kind of believe that rag dolls, ie the Mennym family could be out there living in their house in a London suburb ! The books are funny, sad and the detail of their lives is incredible. They were classified as YA in the library but a good reader or child could enjoy them from age 8 or so onwards I think."

The kitchen is the landing on top of the cellar stairs. Room for a cooker and my fridge is a shelf in front of a window. Extra shelves under the stairs. In winter I put milk and butter in a bag and hang them outside. Working space is a let down shelf over the stairs. 
My living room is 10ft by 7 . This is normal and large families were brought up in this cottage. But..it’s easy to clean and snug ! This photo is so nice. Very chic !"
