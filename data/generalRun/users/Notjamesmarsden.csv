Ours didn’t look easy to break into, the hatch was missing brackets under it so you could lift it up. So you couldn’t tell from the outside, you had to know."
CozyPlaces,fe4splq,t1_fe4hjdf,1578862399.0,"No problem. Our boat was shockingly easy to break into lol

Long Beach is so much more lax about it that their houseboats actually look like houses too lol. We almost moved down there actually but the deal fell through cause the guy was shady af then attacked my friend. This is almost a decade ago. 

Bonus note: our marina and pool actually ended up in GTA v even tho they tore it down right before the game came out. They owned apartments and slips, the big ass pool was no exaggeration.

CozyPlaces,fe3mln4,t1_fe3jhxs,1578850667.0,"Marina Del Rey. When we bought the boat we told the owners of the marina we wanted to stay there and they let us. We just put down our own deposit for the slip. 
We took a job growing weed so we let our friend who had fallen on hard times stay on the boat. He decided to spend the rent money on meth though and by the time we found out from the marina it was too late, they had already sent the claim to collections and were in possession of the boat.

We snuck on board one night to take a light fixture I had installed out, when we opened up the boat there was a homeless guy sleeping in it. He said “I’ll just grab my things and go” but we all saw he had a peg leg (I swear to God) and told him “it’s not ours anymore... and you need a place” we told him it was gonna be towed in a few days but I’m sure those few days of shelter meant everything to him. 

It’s because reasons like that LA requires a live aboard permit which costs three times as much in rent (still not much) however they stopped giving those out for our marina and the marina owners absolutely don’t enforce it since they let you sleep on the boat ~~technically~~ 5 nights a week regardless of live aboard permit or not."

I helped Christian Bale when his youngest son was just born. Right before he was filming vice I ran into them outside my favorite breakfast place, which happened to be his too. It was called Early World in Brentwood. We chit chat outside and then walk in at the same time. 

As we were all walking in, we walk right past Josh Duhamel... who I also actually helped when his baby was born. 

Josh didn’t remember me (which probably made the “I feel swag af” reaction on my face awkward) and they just didn’t even recognize each other. 

And then the host sat my group right in between them and I got play the avoid awkward eye contact game the whole time.
