bujo,feftts8,t1_fe3p9zw,1579065002.0,I do something super similar. Instead of calling it favorite and least favorite I call it what enthused me and what drained my energy. Great minds think alike
bujo,feftra1,t1_fe23pdn,1579064941.0,Really digging the skin care idea
bujo,feftoua,t1_fe31bgt,1579064883.0,“Things my mom loves” is cool. If i did that spread there would be like two things tho lol
bujo,feftiph,t3_enlvrp,1579064738.0,"Omg so many. Too many. 

Habits (sleep, workouts, meditation), mood, period/ pain symptoms (for endo), books I want to eventually read, quoted/ideas I like, food/water consumption, spending, daily gratitudes and reflection, to-dos and notes (rapid logging)

I’m also a yoga teacher, so I have a few specifics for that. I write out my classes, the duration, and any notes from after about things I want to change. I also have a separate section where I’m tracking to see if/how factors like class time, duration and social media are influencing class attendance"

Endo,fd1exzn,t1_fcy6yur,1578130622.0,"I second this comment. 

So I went to pelvic PT after getting diagnosed *preliminarily* with a condition called pudendal neuralgia and learned that many of my pelvic muscles were wayyyy too tight after years of running, cycling, and vinyasa yoga practices. 

I’m starting PT again after I recover from my laparoscopy because endo and PN need to be treated in tandem to see lasting results (i.e my pelvic PT helped a bit, but the initial treatment I was given did not get me to where I wanted to be with my symptoms). Definitely make sure there’s a fair amount of cross-talk among your treatment team if you take this route. 

Side note: I also had a pelvic PT recommend co-co-treating with accupuncture, but have not yet pursued this. Definitely another option to explore if you take a holistic approach."
