Choices,fcza2q0,t1_fcyacar,1578096729.0,"Well, It's hard to answer questions like that because everyone has different tastes. The books that I obsessively loved on Choices, I loved for reasons that might be the very cause of another person's hatred of the same books.

That said, I'll tell you what has given my joy of interactive reading new life. Chapters. Yes, I've tried Moment's too but I couldn't suggest a book from there because I haven't been able to finish any of them. I'd lose interest way too quickly. In the first chapter, you're thrown into a sex scene but that sells the whole cow in my opinion. I prefer stories that slowly dole out milk and keep me coming back for more. 
Those of you that understand what I'm saying, great. Those of you that don't, what I am saying is that I like a slow burn. 
I've read two whole books on Chapters so far and I've just begun a new one. So far, there has only been one  that I started and gave up on. The two books I read, I couldn't put down. I couldn't buy diamonds fast enough! Those books were called ""69 million things I hate about you"" and ""Private Practice."" 
The first book I loved so much that I almost read it all over again but since I got all the diamond choices, I was happy with the story. Satisfied. It was a genuinely fun read and I found myself laughing a lot. 
The second book, some may find the MC a bit naive and I get that but I loved the book anyway. It's the kind of story that I'd Role play with someone when I'm in mood to write rather than read. 
The third book I haven't finished yet but it's called ""Blurred Lines."" So far, I love it. I had to stop myself from reading it though because I was spending too much. So I'm giving it a break till pay day. 

Anyway, I'm sorry for this being so long but I'm thorough when I'm honest. If you're bored with Choices, I suggest Chapters. Not to sound like a spokesperson for them or anything but I was surprised by what I found on that app. There are ways to earn diamonds other than reading other books. Logging in each day gives you rewards. I think every 3 days gets you like 10 diamonds or so. You can watch ads, you can read other books, you can also buy into their monthly program which gives you more rewards and diamonds for logging in, reading, and watching ads. You also earn little maple leaf looking coins that can be cashed in for diamonds. The exchange rate is higher if you're a monthly member or whatever but if you're not, it's still a good way to get them if you don't want to spend too much money. 
I've also noticed that the books I've read, there are two options when you have a diamond choice. 
Example: 
For 17 üíé you can Kiss LI  
For 12üíé you can hug LI
No diamond you can shake LI's hand. 


I thought it was cool since sometimes you don't wanna spend too many precious gems all at once. Granted, the higher the Diamond, the better the option, but still at least we can decide. 
(Actually, now that I think about it....I think Choices does this too)
Oh! and you can earn day passes for books! It lets you read an entire book (or as much as you can) in 24 hours without needing to buy tickets (just like the keys for choices)

So, there you have it. My suggestions.  I really hope this helps you and, again. I'm sorry for making this so long."
