Take care."

stopdrinking,ffxj1sa,t3_evrfar,1580326133.0,"Every decision you make in a day takes a certain amount of energy, doesn't matter how big. Deciding whether you'll buy that new car takes the same amount of energy as whether to drink or not.
That's why moderation doesn't work as soon as you have a problem with drinking. You just run out of energy.

Have you read This Naked Mind?"
stopdrinking,ffxis8s,t3_evrk10,1580325982.0,"For me it helped to think ahead, what would happen after that so called nice glass of beer: craving for more, hangover, feeling guilt, craving for even more, disappointment as it wasn't that good.

I also tried moderation but I find it easier to just not drink instead of having to decide all the time how much to drink.
Apparently making a decision is stressful for your brain, doesn't matter how big or small."

* VLC stutters while playing certain MKV's.
* PlayerXTreme and others require a monthly subscription to either use it altogether, or for features like subtitles.
* OPlayer seemed to did the trick, but after \~50 minutes in an MKV it crashed.

I'm just looking for a media player that plays all MKV's and has subtitle support.

Happy to pay a couple of dollars if that's what it takes, but definitely not willing to pay a monthly subscription for a media player."
