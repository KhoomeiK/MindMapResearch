YangForPresidentHQ,ff3gm66,t1_fezthv4,1579540622.0,"Tbh im not against background checks. I just wish it was expanded upon more. Despite the propaganda a lot of gun show sellers already run them. If we are going to make it mandatory it should be a simple app or something that quickly does the search. Preferably outsourced from the government as their track record for good web technology is kinda bad.

As for ""modifications"" I'm not sure what you mean. If you mean things like silencers then I'm all for removing the restrictions. It's a perfect example of a dumb gun law passed by people who have no idea about firearm data. 

If u mean bump stocks....Honestly i don't really care. I don't have one, They aren't that useful for ALMOST anything, and finally they aren't that hard to make illegally anyway. Ban them or don't I don't care honestly.

I'm not fond of his idea to require licencing for gun ownership with a 5 year renewal period. It's a right. The 2nd amendment isn't for hunting. It never was. 

Ammo capacity regulation I don't support

The gun storage across state lines only annoys law abiding citizens. It's akin to to having a no firearm sign on a building.

The voluntary buy back program he pushes is the first step to an involuntary one IMHO.

His mental health agendas are pretty good.

Just going down the list.

TLDR: Im fine with REALLY easy background checks. I'm not fine with restricting guns in general. The 2nd amendment was never about hunting. I'd rather see security guards at movie theaters than a restriction of my rights."

To answer you though if he got the Democrat nomination I think he could win. He is lefty enough to get democrats on board to beat trump and he is capitalist enough to get centrists and some economic conservatives to vote for him. 

I wish he would drop his views on gun control by a few degrees. If he did though I suspect he would win by a large margin. Democrats CONSTANTLY underestimate how many voters will never even consider them with their stupid gun policies. However, I suspect if he won it would be like Obama who talked a lot but never actually pushed for much more gun control. 

He's a liberal capitalist. That has appeal to a lot of people. And whats more I would never expect him up simply demonize 30% of the population or more just for not agreeing with him. It's unreal that so many progressive liberals can't wrap their heads around the fact that most conservatives/centrists/independents are not fascists, and it actually really pisses them off to be called that.

Would he win as an independent? Hell fucking no. But honestly i think he could win as a Democrat......as long as he educates himself on foreign policy..."

As far as whose a better choice I have no idea. Personally I think Yang is a legit good candidate and even though he's way too left on some issues for me he seems to be literally the only person looking towards to future.

 He is a cali left wing guy, but he's also a capitalist by trade. He recognizes that healthcare and education are issues but unlike the other dems he looks at the source of those problems and how to fix them rather than say big Gov should just finance it off rich peoples wallets. 

But most importantly of all he is not divisive. He doesn't call anyone not a leftist deplorable. And his base unlike the Sander base wants to help everyone unlike about every other candidate. Im so sick of the hate throwing Im actually supporting a Democrat.

Obviously there are certainly other people I would like a LOT more like Amish, but they aren't running.

But there is no chance in hell he gets the nomination.....so I'll probably not vote. One thing is certain though. I will not now or ever vote for Trump. Even if it benefited me I wouldn't.
