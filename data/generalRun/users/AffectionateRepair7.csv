bipolar,ffhiyvp,t1_ffhisp3,1579937382.0,"Gotcha, Im honestly happy with how I’m feeling but terrified of bad side effects coming. I don’t want to lose my hair again but Im also really sensitive to meds and don’t want to start pill hopping."

AskReddit,febwb4a,t3_eodk74,1578963474.0,Had a few but I mainly remember a guy who got high on acid and stabbed someone in the neck with a box cutter.

AskReddit,fdpqce6,t3_emmtib,1578636511.0,Was riding my boyfriends dick and started begging him to slap my ass. He went in for the wind up and missed hitting his balls instead.
AmItheAsshole,fdpou2x,t3_emmkc6,1578634995.0,"NTA, I remembering crying in college 4 times in public. Each one was while in the library, shit is stressful!"
AskReddit,fdpnw4b,t1_fdpmx5q,1578634102.0,Okay but compliments from girls always feel better than ones from boys personally. Mainly because they usually don’t have any alternative motives so you know they’re being honest.

bipolar,fdg8b2e,t3_ejaf6r,1578384269.0,"So I’m almost done with the lyrics but I think it’s missing another verse at the end. Thoughts?

Yeah I’m doing well
I’m just fine
The words slip out my mouth
They taste like lies

That bitter bile
From every fake smile 
Wondering how long it’ll take before I crack 
And make a mistake because 

I’m not okay but I’m still fine 
They say these feelings pass with time 
White drawers, white walls, white cotton sheets
Deep breaths and restless sleeps

I miss her I really do 
I cry and sob to you 
About a girl I loved
A girl I used to be 

Counting objects in the room,
Before the thoughts consume
And I wonder how long it’ll take 

Side effects and belly aches
From 1 to 10 you ask how I am and I say,

I’m not okay but I’m still fine 
They say these feelings pass with time 
White drawers, white walls, white cotton sheets
Deep breaths and restless sleeps

*violin solo*

Fall, winter, spring
Orange bottles bring
Clarity familiarity 
Of who I am
Who I’m supposed to be"

harrypotter,fdbxxrr,t3_ekk0dt,1578263572.0,"Interesting concept, if I’m being honest I like to think Harry would have been sorted into Gryffindor even if he never explicitly asked to not be placed in Slytherin. His character arc is more fitting, to me, in Gryffindor. I think the aspects of him that made him an excellent candidate for the Slytherin house were largely due to the horcrux hidden inside of him. That’s just my opinion though!"
AmItheAsshole,fd7lfzw,t1_fd64431,1578206299.0,"Literally exactly what I’m saying. I was downvoted to hell for it but I genuinely believe if OP was a guy who payed child support but refused to be involved in any other way, they’d be called an asshole and a deadbeat."
AmItheAsshole,fd7kz7y,t1_fd75b95,1578206113.0,"How is she potentially exposing herself to abuse? I didn’t read anything indicating that but I may be wrong! 

Tbh what gets me about this post is that quite frankly this situation isn’t about OP or even her ex, it’s about this little girl. Idc what anyone says but once you have a kid your wants no longer come first. If you choose to have unprotected sex, choose to have the baby, and don’t choose to have a closed adoption then you have to provide some level of emotional parental support in my opinion, it’s the decent thing to do."

I literally was playing my violin in exchange for stuff at Walmart and Taco Bell, streaking and doing naked laps in the pool, and the worst part was I was convincing other people to do it too. They knew something was fishy once I started saying I had superpowers though. That and the whole seeing and hearing bits lol."
