It's usually guys, though."

AskReddit,ff680b1,t3_ervupq,1579621305.0,"Not okay, actually.
I'm having one of my depressive episodes after a while and i want to be away from everyone just for some days to sorts things out.

I'm also having a dilemma where I don't know if i should confess to my crush. I'm 100% convinced it's one sided and even knowing that, part of me tells me i should confess asap so i can get over it quickly. The other part of me, though, is scared of losing a great friend and a deep connection i have with him. Idk.
Feels nice not to lie to this question for once, at least."

IncelTears,fenu1st,t3_eq2r19,1579290704.0,"From the description you shared, I don't think you are. Its unfortunate that you can't last a relationship and people view you as creepy though. If you do want a relationship to work out and you can't, then you could try to have a therapist or someone to help you understand your mind better, before trying more relationships. Sometimes it just doesn't work for something internal, a thing that you have to take in mind first. 
Again, you don't really get into the incel territory just because people view you as creepy or had short relationships. You're not blaming all females or a system or whatever incels go on to not see how their own beliefs and themselves are rotten.
You just look like you haven't had good luck, so i wish you some!"
