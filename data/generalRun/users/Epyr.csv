AmItheAsshole,ffx7a3i,t1_ffwund2,1580319233.0,"Well, depending on where he lives it may not actually be an enforceable clause."
AskReddit,ffvpsod,t1_ffvoady,1580269923.0,"It's the argument people make against assault rifles (depends a bit on what definition of assault rifle you use as it changes pretty commonly and encompasses a fairly wide range of small arms). Assault rifles do pose greater threats than other small arms, there is a reason why it's the main armament of every military in the world. You can make arguments about why having an assault rifle can be less dangerous and many of those arguments do have merit and are the reason I'm not personally against the owning of assault rifles. That being said, in the end someone who is good with guns can kill a lot more with an assault rifle than other types of small arms (though realistically semi-automatic are actually generally more dangerous as they burn ammo at a slower rate but they are often not banned when full-automatic weapons are banned). You can disagree with what I'm saying but it's the argument the side you disagree with uses and understanding their concerns can help you better understand the issue at large."
AskReddit,ffvnupf,t1_ffuiq99,1580268544.0,"Lol, I understand guns. I personally couldn't care less if assault rifles are legal or not.That's the argument people tend to use against assault rifles though. Few liberals are actually trying to take away all your guns."
AskReddit,ffu49z2,t1_ffu1es3,1580234178.0,"For assault rifles it's usually an attempt to minimize the damage a single mass shooter can cause. An assault rifle can kill more people faster than a handgun.

EDIT: So apparently just stating the argument that I hear most commonly around assault rifle bans makes me an ignorant liberal? You guys do know that very few liberals actually argue for the banning of all guns right?"
AskReddit,ffrmzk2,t1_ffpb8dp,1580161402.0,"The doctor was probably actually happy about that message. Premature babies statistically have issues (the longer ago this was the more issues you would likely have) and a good doctor should inform patients of what to expect, even if it's negative. It doesn't mean that they hope you end up like that, just that part of their job is to prepare people for potentially negative expected outcomes."

todayilearned,feby4uu,t1_febxc8n,1578964158.0,"It's Northern Ontario, and is part of the Boreal forest. We are talking about Canadian forest coverage so pointing out that not many people live in a large area of the Boreal forest is relevant. I also don't live in Toronto or ever have so get off of your high horse with that 'you people' nonsense."
todayilearned,febusrk,t1_febp4br,1578962983.0,There are massive areas of the Boreal forest that people don't live in. The further North and further away from the coast you go the less and less people you find. There ain't many people living in Kenora District outside of the biggest cities there.
todayilearned,febu5zs,t1_febh53z,1578962696.0,"Well, it's basically just trees on top of rock. Not much soil so you can't really grow anything there except trees. Turns out, not being able to grow food tends to make people avoid areas."
canada,febsuj7,t1_fe9oqp9,1578962256.0,Ontario has half of all Canadian manufacturing and is ahead of all other provinces by [a wide margin](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3610048801&pickMembers%5B0%5D=2.46). If it's made in Canada their is a decent chance it was made in Ontario (the St. Lawrence Corridor in Quebec is also a manufacturing powerhouse). Many other Canadians don't really acknowledge that though.
MapPorn,fdn6gfh,t1_fdmn2m7,1578578591.0,"Look at Newfoundland vs similar latitudes in Europe and you'll see that the Gulf stream does in deed play a massive role.

The West coast has some really interesting weather dynamics due to the mountains, the rotation of the Earth and other ocean currents that cause it to be warmer."
MapPorn,fdluj7o,t1_fdldb94,1578532816.0,The biggest reason isn't about coasts in the way you are thinking. Europe is warmer due to the Gulf Stream and Regina has cold winters as they tend to get cold air systems from the arctic that move South and kinda just sit over them all winter. Lake effect does make a difference but isn't the biggest reason for the drastic differences between UK and Saskatchewan weather
canada,fdlrps7,t1_fdlqoyg,1578530910.0,"No, it really is an extremely rare thing to think about for me. Maybe a couple times a year at most, it really plays an extremely small part of my life."
canada,fdlk8mc,t1_fdlimu3,1578525900.0,"To be fair, I'm a dual citizen and wouldn't think to bring that up either. I see myself as Canadian and while I have citizenship of another country I really rarely think about that fact. That being said, I never plan on running for government."
todayilearned,fdlh6wh,t1_fdl0qcw,1578523940.0,Many governments have introduced taxes specifically aimed at targeting that issue. That logic has been applied in many places and is a big reason that tobacco is as expensive as it is in many places worldwide (and has actually led to decreased usage in many places).
worldnews,fdlg2wb,t1_fdl7z3v,1578523260.0,"There isn't much of a spin there, that's a pretty accurate telling of what happened. Iraqi civilians protested (violently) outside of a US embassy in response to the US bombing an Iranian-backed militia group. The only people who died were the Iranian-backed militiamen.

worldnews,fdk2d95,t1_fdjfzzp,1578494358.0,The introduction of new facts should change opinions on an issue. The US should release the evidence they have. Without those facts (as the US has refused to provide them) the US is being a warmonger with the evidence they have currently provided.
worldnews,fdk1v6m,t1_fdjo398,1578493989.0,"As a Canadian, starting a war means people will die. As the country pushing for war you should realize that means the potential for people to die in America because of that. I would not be on America's side here unless they publically release the evidence they had on the Iranian general. Without that it was a clear act of war in my opinion and the consequences shouldn't be Canada's problem (though it likely will anyways)"
pics,fd43nm5,t1_fd2w1za,1578164103.0,"Well, it's more so to attempt to stop the massacre of unarmed civilians which has been the way of war for thousands of years. In a war people are going to die, it's not a war otherwise. In the past 100 years we have tried to civilize war, which in many ways we have succeeded as civilian casualty rates in Western-led wars have plummeted. Having studied history mass executions of unarmed civilians/POWs was the norm, having those be rare (and not publicly applauded) is a very, very recent development in human history."
science,fd2owj2,t1_fd15jzu,1578150274.0,"People are underestimating how much money these factories cost. It's not like the average Joe can just start up a battery factory, they can cost a ton of money that very few people have access to. As well, the ones who do have the money and are already in the space likely already have the money invested in the old tech which they don't want to lose out on."

todayilearned,fckxv3s,t1_fckwcnb,1577735527.0,"Shooting while ""you’re delirious and sleepy"" is why I'm against guns for home defense. You are more likely to shoot a loved one than an intruder. There are more accidental gun deaths than deaths from self defense with a gun."
