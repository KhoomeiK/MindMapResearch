There's still days where everything is shit and I don't want to go on but there's now more days where I turn things around. But no it's not easy and it takes time.

It all needs to be done in conjunction with releasing past memories and emotions as well."
depression,ff57xfb,t1_ff49wvq,1579582860.0,"Yeh I was a lot like this, couple of good days and then I'd collapse and have to push through the rest of the week. I decided to quit my full time job and took a bar job instead where I work 3-4 evenings a week and they change every week, not always in order - find it much more manageable than 5 full days in a row."
