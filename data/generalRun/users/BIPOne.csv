Regarding the downs, and the sex, you have to live with up and downs from the pwBPD, thats just in the disorder and nothing you can change, that is up to the person who has it, via therapy and maybe meds to change the mood, as you stated.

&#x200B;

When someone with BPD is down, then you are either dragged down too, and that makes the pwBPD even more confused in their reactions, and they can go from clingy, to ""what the FUCK are YOU sad for???"" and give an attitude.

&#x200B;

I have literally seen someone change from a shiny rainbow mood, to a dark cloud above their head, in mere seconds. From clinging and happy, to depressed, reserved and ""leave me the fuck alone"" statements. The issue is that the explicit words I used in the sentence, are often used, as well, because the mood CAN swing violently and into an extreme.

&#x200B;

The best would be avoiding triggers. If you notice a mood change, then try to subtly change your behaviour too. From clingy, or cuddly, to silent, or the opposite, depending on the situation.

Augmented bodies, I am not sure, and it is a long time since I studied the ""actual"" available regulations, but it would make sense that both augmentation, as well as aggressive genetical augmentation are ""illegal"" or frowned upon.

People like Bashir exist, who are ""enhanced"", but those enhancements are superficial at best. And all the people we see, who are superhumans, are so because of some sort of ""cosmic or planetary radiation"", ""spores"" or entities like ""the Companion"".

I assume they COULD, but just like modern humans, who have ""slept past significant improvements"", they have slept past such things, IF they aren't outright FORBIDDEN. I HAVE to mention the change from fossil fuels to others, we have IRL slept past researching these things extensively, and NOW have to do so.

Humans in ST have seemingly no need to do so, for most likely, plot device and god modding reasons by the writers, otherwise they WOULD most surely have researched much more into that direction.

The Borg, I agree, but the issue is, that while they are a plague and scourge, they see OTHER underdeveloped civilisations as ""threats to themselves and others"", and ""want to improve quality of life, for ALL species"".
