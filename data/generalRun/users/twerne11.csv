unpopularopinion,fgxjz8b,t3_f0o20j,1581173589.0,I agree wholeheartedly. I always tell people no thanks I don’t need more friends.
unpopularopinion,fgxjbtg,t1_fgwig93,1581173410.0,"I’ve played softball starting at age 5 on (27 now) like collegiate level and I once had a boyfriend mansplain a double RBI to while in line waiting for a flight. He wouldn’t listen when I said he was wrong and that even the acronym he just gave me was wrong. I don’t remember what he called it but it wasn’t Runs Batted In. When I finally said do you know this is the definition of mansplaining the girl behind us just started cackling. He then said no, this isn’t mansplaining. Mansplaining is blah blah blah. And that’s when I knew the relationship was doomed lmao"
sex,fgv3rj0,t1_fgrofqy,1581136294.0,Listen let me on top and I am good to goooo. But I realize this is rare. Sometimes I just think it’s women not being vocal enough about what works for them.
