WTF,ffu0n0l,t3_ev8b2b,1580231927.0,"I checked mine i got in September and it says the same thing, it also has like 30-40 more things listed so i think it’s just covering a lot"
AmItheAsshole,fft9jq3,t3_ev4r6c,1580213420.0,NTA - giving in will just encourage Samantha’s behavior and condition her go act like this again in the future
TooAfraidToAsk,ff3whh0,t3_erim9o,1579550364.0,"Whenever they come to inspect my apartment i clean it but don’t go overboard. They check for mold, make sure the air filters work, check the smoke detectors, etc. They’re normally in and out within 10 minutes. The people that manage my apartment go with them so if I had an extra pet they would know, but I’ve heard of companies that don’t have the landlords or managers go with them so I’m sure it wouldn’t make a difference in that case"

nextfuckinglevel,fezumwx,t3_er0mq3,1579461872.0,I actually read that a lot of captive cheetahs are anxious so they give them “service pups” like this to grow up with. It’s so sweet they grow up together and become best friends. When they’re adults the pup helps the cheetah with its anxiety. I highly recommend googling pictures they’re amazing
AmItheAsshole,fezua3l,t1_feztgok,1579461737.0,"Wouldn’t it be the opposite though? Shouldn’t the fact that she’s actively trying to get out of an abusive relationship and make an independent life for herself (eventually, right now she’s asking for help which is a great thing) be setting a good example for your children? Showing them that no situation is permanent if you don’t want it to be, they’re stronger than they think, asking for help is never a bad thing, etc. lot of good messages there for them"
DetroitBecomeHuman,few2chr,t3_eqr3wv,1579404507.0,Hahahaha my brother felt the same way. But i loved having her around lol. Unfortunately (for you) there’s really no place you can “leave” her but you can kill her off in a couple places. I believe when you’re crossing the highway is one? I never tried though so I’m not positive
The100,fen1wmf,t3_eq1m3h,1579275135.0,"Lexa was my favoriteeeee character. I liked her for a variety of reasons. She was a strong female character who, she pretty much led the last of the human race (that they knew of at the time), her character growth was great in the sense that when she was introduced she was very cold and brutal but as she grew she became more loving and soft (yet still remained firm and a good leader). Idk there’s a lot i can go into about her but she was my favorite along with Lincoln and Octavia."
AmItheAsshole,fen1dih,t3_eq1n5w,1579274792.0,"I’m really hoping this is a shit post and you’re a troll or something but for some reason I feel like you’re not. Yes, YTA."
explainlikeimfive,fed9xwz,t3_eokl55,1579005139.0,"I always wondered this! If identical twins have 100% same DNA and they marry identical twins, it only makes sense their kids would have the same DNA right?? So technically they’d be cousins but biologically they’d be siblings"
insaneparents,fdtcrlo,t1_fdtcc0u,1578714914.0,Fake - there’s no way a two year old would have a curfew let alone be allowed to be out by himself? This is clearly fake
insanepeoplefacebook,fdsyswp,t1_fdrg5dt,1578709709.0,"Exactly what it was, (tmi) his bladder was getting blocked to the point his urine was being pushed back into his kidneys so they removed his penis and both widened/shortened his urethra to the size of a females. If i take him to a different vet if they do a quick glance they’ll think he’s a female unless i tell them otherwise"
insanepeoplefacebook,fdqrs7s,t3_emt61s,1578673490.0,"My cat had to have a “sex change” because of major bladder issues, but even then i wouldn’t consider him a transgender animal...?"
offmychest,fdkf4xq,t1_fdjbvi0,1578502550.0,Yeah I had gotten my bachelors in South Carolina but after two years of not using my degree and failing to find a job in the field I made the decision to further my education and move somewhere with better opportunities. Got a job in the field out in Oregon almost a month before I even moved there
offmychest,fdjbc58,t1_fdix21u,1578464100.0,"I moved from SC to OR, honestly the friends I’ve made have come from my masters program because we all pretty much have the same goals"
AmItheAsshole,fdiw870,t1_fdiw2rg,1578452445.0,"It’s basic conditioning. Cat does something bad, they get sprayed, they learn not to do that thing. I’m not saying that I would ever use a spray bottle on my cats (in fact mine are beyond spoiled and get away with absolutely everything) but I’ve known people who have used them and they do work"
offmychest,fdiw27j,t3_elmgc6,1578452335.0,Do it! I’m 23 and moved from the east coast to west coast in September. Left all my friends and my jobs but i still keep in contact with them and am willing to visit. It was so worth it though. I got the fresh start i desperately needed and i finally feel like my life is headed somewhere
AmItheAsshole,fdivuo1,t3_elmgfw,1578452199.0,"NAH - If your father was doing it to be malicious then i would say otherwise, but the way you worded it makes it sound like he’s doing it to try and discipline. But i can completely understand where you’re coming from, as his methods are a bit extreme and not helpful. Have you suggested trying an alternative like a spray bottle or something?"
offmychest,fdczhe5,t3_ekphh3,1578288998.0,You actually can get help for this. Many people are in therapy for reasons very similar to this and find it helpful
nextfuckinglevel,fdchq5f,t1_fdchj4y,1578275183.0,"It may not help the adults, and it may not help the kids physically, but it definitely helps them feel a little better emotionally. Even if just for a few moments."
TooAfraidToAsk,fcuf7hk,t3_eizmiz,1577979504.0,honestly it’s just another part of your name. My middle name is Lynn but there’s absolutely no one in my family named that nor is there any reason my parents chose that other than they liked it. It’s just part of a name
AmItheAsshole,fcnvnbo,t1_fcnvd8j,1577819341.0,"No, because they sit every time they go to the bathroom. You don’t."
AmItheAsshole,fck5p9v,t3_ehmk76,1577717330.0,NTA - it’s a desk. That you’re using to write a paper on. Clearly you won’t be there all day she seems kind of immature not to just let you use it until you’re done writing your essay
