bestof,fg8cqjb,t1_fg2f33o,1580615691.0,"First, you have to know what a ouija board is. A “mystic” game two people (kids) play whereby you each place a hand on the game’s planchette—a pointer. Then, through pure mysticism (or someone pushing the planchette along the board) letters, numbers, and/or yes and no answers may be provided to the players. 

Second, you have to understand that the /r/askouija sub is “played” by users each submitting a letter to the previous commenter’s submission to create a word “ouija” style. Once a suitable ending has been reached, someone comments “Goodybe”, as this is one of the words on an actual ouija board indicating the mystical force is done communicating. 

Third, Reddit’s comment voting allows the best responses of both letter replies and complete word replies to float to the top of the submissions. 

Knowing these things, you can deduce that the user who commented the “e” changed the path of the ouija string from potentially “LOVEHIM” to “LOVEHER”, which is why the “e” commenter has received all the accolades and karma."
