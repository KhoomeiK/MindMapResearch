relationship_advice,fecdzoq,t1_fe9rc33,1578971657.0,Always take the higher road my friend.  Yeah she’s being completely immature and she should communicate more but don’t let that bring you down to her level.  Be a man and step up and break up with her face to face. That’ll show her how clingy you are.

Being parents is a joint ownership. Unless otherwise discussed he should be there to help out. I’m not saying he shouldn’t go to the gym, but compromise. Instead of 2 hours for four days see if he’ll go for an hour everyday or see if he’ll be able wake up slightly earlier and go before work. 
You should be able to take a breather too."

relationship_advice,fcg5alv,t1_fcfw87d,1577636611.0,"I agree with this post.  Youâ€™ve been through something traumatic, having to take care of your parents at such a young age promotes emotional instability.  Youâ€™re scared he might become like your parents and youâ€™d be trapped caring for him just like you did for them. Youâ€™re boyfriend has attempted to appease you in some ways but ultimately wants to be a normal 21 year old and dip his toes into what a lot of 21 year olds do.  Experiment with drugs, drink etc etc.  Therapy seems like a good option, so does communicating more with your boyfriend. 
Also, when he does drink a horrendous amount of alcohol you donâ€™t always have to be there to take care of him.  Have high sleep it off on the couch or something.  Donâ€™t feel obligated to take care of him just because he got himself drunk."
