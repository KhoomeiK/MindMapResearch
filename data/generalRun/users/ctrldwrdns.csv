Seriously, I understand that having a child with a disability comes with its challenges, but you signed up for that when you decided to have a child."

AmItheAsshole,fdpa0uk,t1_fdocolu,1578623488.0,Teenagers are either children or basically adults depending on what is convenient for their parents at the time. They get treated like children but expected to act like adults and take on adult responsibilities.
HomeschoolRecovery,fdiurob,t3_ell5li,1578451496.0,"First of all, there is no way public school would ever cost any more money than homeschool. You may already know this but just in case you have been sheltered and don't know, public school is free except for extra stuff like athletics and music depending on the school. You'd probably be spending less money on school supplies in public school. Your parents are lying about public school being expensive and using it as an excuse to keep you at home. This actually is not uncommon of homeschool parents.

You say you volunteer at a park, which is great. I suggest looking into more volunteer opportunities in your area - at an animal shelter, habitat for humanity etc. Also look into if your local library has any book clubs or crafting groups. If there aren't any, you can ask to start one.

Good luck!"
HomeschoolRecovery,fdi1zfs,t3_ele01n,1578434304.0,"I only went to church and dance class a couple times a week (and dance was only until I was 13). That's only maybe 4-6 hours of socialization with people my age a week, compared to the 8 hours a day my peers were getting. I never really made strong friendships with anyone there despite the fact that my parents basically hand-picked my friends for me. My mom tried to force me to be friends with the people in my youth group in my early teen years, but she came to every youth group meeting as a ""leader"" and made everything awkward. Plus she refused to recognize my horrible social anxiety at the time. Even without social anxiety I wasn't interested in being friends with any of them as they were the type of evangelical I detest. From ages 14-18 I had no contact with anyone my age except my online friends. There really weren't things I was interested in our area, as I was no good at music, sports, or art and we didn't live in an area with a lot of activities for homeschoolers, not even a park I could walk to, something even my therapist refused to acknowledge was a reality for me. I'm getting upset again just writing this and thinking of how my childhood was robbed from me."
AmItheAsshole,fd6jl42,t1_fd61udn,1578192028.0,If his parents act like this then there are definitely some issues going on at home. I hate this trend of publicly humiliating children as punishment and it has only gotten worse on social media. Also will never understand parents destroying expensive items (that they likely bought) to prove a point. Just store it in the closet until he brings up his grades and actually help him with the subjects he’s struggling with. With parents like this it is no surprise the kid is doing poorly in school.
college,fcvyazb,t1_fcvxot8,1578012870.0,"I don't know about other schools but I know that Aramark basically controls everything at mine. Look them up, they have absolutely horrible policies. They also have a clause in the contract that requires school events only to use them as catering. Plus they pay their employees like shit and use prison labor (not at the schools but at the prisons they contract with). Their representatives that have talked to students at my school have been nothing but dismissive and condescending. Many students have complained that the food makes them sick but they cannot get out of the meal plan. Like you, a lot of us are wasting money."
college,fcvt2jy,t3_ej3dps,1578009471.0,"Yeah, they require a meal plan unless you're a commuter and they only let you be a commuter under certain circumstances. Our dining services are run by Aramark and their health and safety practices are absolutely horrible. If you're a first year you're required to buy a 21 meal a week plan with about $50 in dining credit per semester which you can use on snacks and stuff. Our dining services has changed management about 4 times in the last 2 years. It's also not great for those with dietary restrictions. If you have a severe allergy you can get exempt from the meal plan but they make you go through all sorts of expensive tests to prove you have the allergy. It's a mess."

AmItheAsshole,fcoft5j,t1_fcnfi3s,1577831195.0,"Yeah I had friends like this. I put up with it for a while, telling myself that they weren't doing it on purpose.

HomeschoolRecovery,fci1st5,t1_fchwt3a,1577656718.0,"In some ways, the teenager is socially constructed, as it wasn't really a separate category of Western culture until like the 1950s, post-war era, so I get it from that perspective, but yeah, teenage brains are different from those of adults.

HomeschoolRecovery,fc3qwmj,t3_eg0oii,1577396365.0,"I also don't tell people I was homeschooled. I don't lie and say I went to public school, I just don't bring up my homeschooling because I don't want people to treat me like a freak. The people I have told usually don't really care. I've had a couple people be like ""omg I wish I was homeschooled"" and think that I did no work at all when in reality I had to work in the summer. Basically if they weren't homeschooled too they'll never understand it, but most of the reactions, if annoying, were not bad at all, it was just my anxiety thinking they wouldn't want to be friends with the weird homeschooled kid."
