Middle names aren’t really important, and in 99% of cases you can just use an initial. It’s a reasonable compromise; your wife gets to honour her grandfather and your son doesn’t have a nightmare dealing with a bad name. The fact that you don’t even want to consider compromising and using it as a middle name when it obviously means a lot to your wife makes you the asshole. Using it as a middle name comes with none of the downsides making it his first name does. Most people don’t even tell others their middle name.

ProRevenge,fcidh4h,t1_fcgj2oh,1577660917.0,"Number two does make some sense, and while the name calling was stupid, their response was proportionate—tell OP off and not to do so again, but let them keep their job. They didn’t get mad that OP came up with a solution, they got mad that somebody unauthorised had downloaded a copy of the systems source code and submitted a fix without authorisation or verification.

In OP’s case they were just trying to help, but that doesn’t change the fact they were still doing something they weren’t authorised to do. You’d get in just as much trouble for taking a copy of the companies financial statements from the CFO’s desk to check for holes in the budget; well meaning but something you shouldn’t have access to.

OP’s fix turned out fine, but bugs, especially system level ones, follow an *assessment, review, assignment, execution, review* process for a reason. It prevents code from breaking other things or security holes being added. All those things still need to be done with OP’s code, but know it’s being done on code the team isn’t familiar with (they didn’t write), and on code written by somebody not familiar with the teams coding standards; that makes issues even harder to find.

AmItheAsshole,fc6ted9,t1_fc6e8r3,1577489014.0,"Of course you’re going to call him daddy in front of your son, and naturally your daughter is going to pick up on that. Both of those make perfect sense and are fine. What makes this a bit YTA is this part:

>I said that our daughter has all the right to call my husband daddy if it makes her happy. He then asked me how I'd feel if he made our daughter call his wife ""mommy"". I told him that if my daughter hasn't called her "" Mommy "" after 6 years of knowing her, it is because she never wanted to. I said that it isn't my fault if our daughter feels closer to her stepfather and actually loves our family together. After saying that, I hanged up.

You’re daughter didn’t just one day decide she loved your husband enough to call him daddy, she started after she heard you calling him that in front of your son. You say they’ve always had a good relationship, her feelings for your husband almost certainly haven’t change. She just noticed he’s going by a different name.

Letting her call him daddy is overall probably a good thing. It probably won’t do any damage if handled right. Creating a distinction between your son and daughters terms for him could also lead to major issues with sibling resentment and feeling that the brother is loved more because that is his ‘real’ dad.

That said, you should also be mindful of her biological father. Shitty husband aside, he is her father and as others have pointed out it if things aren’t handled careful it can lead it parental alienation. It’s also gotta hurt see his daughter call somebody else daddy—you probably, rightfully, aren’t as concerned about that—which is something to keep in mind to keep a civil relationship for your daughters sake.

To sum it up, nobody is wrong for letting her call him daddy, or not forcing her to call step-mother mummy, but YTA for the comments you made to your ex about it, and you should tread carefully for the sake of everybody."

Tax increase also don’t necessarily work for smoking. Most tax funded services work on the theory that everybody pays in a small amount, but only some people require a large amount of services in return. That isn’t true for smokers, where they will all pay in a small amount but will almost all require costly care at some point where from serious lung conditions or more minor ones (e.g. more regular chest infections).
