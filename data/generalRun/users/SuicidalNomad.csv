I had a pretty stable group. Couple frequent flyer drug addicts, couple depressed people. No one that you'd see in something like Cuckoo's Nest, but that's just the luck of the draw what you get.

There is no denying biological fact, in this fictional universe where this not-real person exists (but people like her do irl). I, being bisexual, don't give an iota of a microscopic anal wart on a rat's shithole. I am attracted to both diks and bobs and vagine.
