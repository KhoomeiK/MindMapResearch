answers,ffn7i35,t1_ffmy2wk,1580062812.0,I miss aspects of not owning a car but it is also liberating having your own transportation as well. Having kids definitely tipped the scales towards a car being more appealing than not.
TwoXChromosomes,ffmh88d,t3_etzp1z,1580054669.0,"I know this news will come with baggage for you. Its a horrible thing to know.

But I have a daughter who's father raped me and beat me during my pregnancy with her. It is hard to see her dad in her sometimes, it is hard that she has special needs and is a handful. 

It is not her fault tho. I would not trade her for the world. It never matters how hard things get, I fight for her, I advocate for her, I love her with all my heart. 

My daughter is not her father. DNA is only half the story, I have nurtured her much differently than her father was groomed by his parents. She is her own person and I don't hold any resentment for her father against her.


All this to say, you have a wonderful mother who wanted to shield you from harm. She didnt want you to feel ashamed or hurt or conflicted, and though you do know now and have that burden of knowledge, you mean no less to anyone who loves you. You are still cherished and loved. 


I am sorry that you had to learn the way you did but I really think your parents will always love you and care for YOU and not give much attention to the circumstances that brought you into the world.

I wish you all the best and hope you can come to understand that a parents love for their children, adopted or not, transcends all other things."

People are traded between teams all the time which seems dumb to me, especially all the hype around draft picks and what not.

There isnt much endurance or skill for me compared to other sports.

Dudes with a penis they find abnormal, most women care less than you think. I certainly dont care what size penis you have. I am a lot more worried about how you treat me and how we vibe than the size of a penis. 

Truthfully, I'd prefer a smaller dick over a too huge dick. Blowjobs are easier, my guts arent going to get jabbed, and dudes with big dongs can end up feeling like since the dick is big they dont have to put any other effort into sex or pleasing their partner.
