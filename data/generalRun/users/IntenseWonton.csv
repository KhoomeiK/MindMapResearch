The Forest is another survival/crafting game where you have to defend yourself from cannibals while looking for your son.

PS4,fdexlxm,t3_el0stc,1578348750.0," This is an awesome idea and great way of keeping the kids in school. I have a few kid friendly team building games

Overcooked 1 and 2 - a team based puzzle game that really stresses on communication. 

Keep talking and nobody explodes - a game where 1 player looks at the tv and tries to explain a bomb while the other kids have a 20 page manual to give instructions based on the description of the defuser.

Lovers in a dangerous spacetime - 4 players control how the ships move while defending the ship. 

All 3 games I recommend are great team building games that can help with working on communicating. They'll run into some frustrating stages, but if they can properly communicate without stepping on each other's toes, they'll have a ton of fun. If they start fighting each other, this would be a great teaching moment to learn how to communicate without offending."

I recently deleted all my social media apps besides Reddit. I got tired of all the negatives I see locally and around the world. I was also getting hit with some major depression and my social media was not helping.

A big part of why everyone is saying Tony is the guy to really challenge Khabib is the fact that his ground game is dangerous and he loves to throw elbows from his back.  Khabib has not faced the guy in the UFC who is dangerous off his back. That is why even Khabib states that Tony is the most dangerous opponent that he is up against and is taking this fight much more serious.
