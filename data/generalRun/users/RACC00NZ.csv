funny,feoyk11,t1_feo4vvo,1579308181.0,"Ah the guy who we take our motorcycles to has a similar (or the same) sign. Luckily we've never been charged the ""you worked on it first"" price despite having definitely worked on it first. The sign always makes me chuckle which is nice after being told how expensive the repairs will be!"
