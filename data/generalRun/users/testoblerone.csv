blackmagicfuckery,ffb38xm,t3_esmoj1,1579750663.0,"This looks very retro futuristic. Like a sci-fi thing conceived by someone who never foresaw the predominance of screens in our time, and also didn't thought of holograms. Like from one of those futuristic magazines from the fifities, ""In the future, forget about boring old flat photographs and welcome the Spherographs! The spherical photograph of the future with an entire landscape in your hands!""."
BadMensAnatomy,ffafgu5,t3_es6c27,1579734504.0,"It sounds like a YA novel series, The Telegony Saga or something like that. A young man lives in a post apocalyptic world where all women have developed a Hive Mind due to a corruption of their Pair Bonding Ability caused by having too much sex with too many men.  
Now the Hive Mind, called The FEMALE (Female Mistress Abundant of Estrogen), is only reproducing more women and the occasional CHAD (Cultivated Hyper Andromorph, class D).  
Our protagonist was born from one of the only few good women out there, and has now been captured by The FEMALE in order to go through a series of public trials, a new form of entertainment where The FEMALE rejoices seeing nice guys suffer romantic humiliation after romantic humiliation at the hands of non-hive mind girls raised just for this purpose. However, our hero uses his knowledge of pre apocalyptic pop culture to navigate the trials, and his higher logic to explain one of those girls out of the Cult of The FEMALE (the religious doctrine through which non-hive mind women are being controlled). At the end our protagonist and the girl fall in love, and she even isn't all that pretty, she has like a mole on her waist but our hero assures her he doesn't mind that much.  
By book three the new couple have successfully Pair-Bonded, a most terrible crime in this civilization, but something that The FEMALE secretly wants to achieve more than anything else.  
By book six The FEMALE has incarnated itself in a single human body with the express purpose of seducing the protagonist and maybe finally be able to Pair Bond.  
By book nine, the protagonist gives the incarnated FEMALE (who is crazy hot, of course), one night of insanely great sex. She has, like, seventy orgasms, but he doesn't climax, so as to deny her his DNA. The FEMALE goes insane because of not having gotten the protagonist's DNA and therefore not even having a chance to Pair Bond, and kills herself, thus destroying the Hive Mind.  
By book twelve, and the start of the New Telegony Saga, the protagonist is the middle aged Patriarch of a new civilization, where the proper order has been restored, and he has fifty of the most desirable women Pair Bonded with him. But there is an evil rebellion brewing among fringe remnants of the Cult of The FEMALE, who are trying to bring The FEMALE back through witchcraft (oh yeah, there's magic now). Not to worry though, by book fifteen our protagonist has managed to destroy all attempts at rebellion by integrating all the would be rebel witches into his harem, turns out all they really wanted was to Pair Bond with the most desirable of men, the protagonist."

BadMensAnatomy,ff3rydt,t3_erauyw,1579547558.0,"Of course, this limbs are temporary. The human male will only possess such limbs until he manages to attach himself to a human female in mating. After this, the limbs usually fall off or are reabsorbed by the body of the male during the process in which his whole body itself becomes absorbed within the female's body. Eventually all that's left are testis inside the female body, which she can use to fertilize her eggs at any time she considers pertinent. Often a vestigial male head can be found sticking out of the female body. This vestigial head is unresponsive and often lacks a jaw, very rarely the head will respond with eye movement to certain stimuli.  
Of course, when the female body finally dies and undergoes the transformation into primordial mycelium-like tissue, in preparation for it's rebirth, the male tissue that has been preserved can sometimes develop into a sessile form, attached to the ground by a spine-like structure. Proximity to this sessile male structures has been observed to trigger puberty in prepubescent males."

Had one of this for many years in a pot, it got crowded with buds so I spread them all over the garden, next spring, flowers everywhere overnight. And we genuinely didn't know what they where, flowers begin as small, black wart-like growths, then they stretch into this tentacle looking things, and then flowers. I came very close to cutting them off in the ugly wart stage, one of the few times being lazy worked for the best."

At least where I live, the only trash you see left over in supermarket carts, if any, is plastic bags, just the odd empty plastic bag from the store which got left over while moving groceries from cart to car, and those flyers they give you at the same supermarket with the promotions they have.  
Then again I haver never in my life seen someone buying groceries while drinking from a cup of anything. You don't eat or drink at the supermarket unless you're in the food court area, or you're a kid and your parents spoil you.   
It always surprises me what customers get away with in the US."

GlobalTalk,fcmahat,t3_ehux70,1577768704.0,"I'll give you my ultimate cozy time, if you want culture specific stuff, because my ultimate cozy place would be pretty much culture neutral.  
So my ultimate cozy time. December 31st, we would get up really early in the morning to go to the tortilleria (the place here in Mexico where you buy freshly made corn tortillas), to buy corn flour, then on the way back stop by the corner store and buy corn husks.  
Back home, me and my mom would wash the corn husks, throw away the pieces that were too small and leave the rest soaking.  
By noon or so, my grandpa would prepare the corn dough, with water and pork fat, this process usually took a little over an hour, it was like 6 kilos of dough. Once done, the dough was left to rest. At the same time my grandma would cook beef and prepare the chile colorado (I don't really know if the right translation is chilly, it's a sauce), once the beef was cooked she would shred it and mix it with the chile.  
And here comes the cozy part. By around three it was tamal making time. We all gathered around the table, you have the dough there, the beef, the corn husks, and you just smear the dough on the husk, add some beef, fold the husk into a neat little package and begin placing the tamales into a large steam cooking pot. This took a couple of hours and it was so much fun, some of my best memories. Talking, joking, laughing.  
When you're done with that, the pot goes on the stove and a couple of hours later the house is filled with the amazing smell of tamales. In the meantime my grandma would make buñuelos (think a wheat tortilla, only really thin and fried, and with sugar sprinkled on it), and that smelled even better.  
Then it was night and time for new years dinner.  
Next day I would get up early to see the Rose Parade on TV (they used to broadcast it in Mexican TV stations back then, and I loved it) while eating tamales, which I guess marks this as a particularly northern mexican experience, mad ancient traditional with the tamales, transcultured stuff with the eminently american TV programming.  
That place in time, those days, are home."

Oddly enough, people who have actually killed others to eat them have very rarely been identified as cattophores. I mean, sure, there's Jonathan Q.

It was the parasite that lives inside the kitten's skull that came out the feline's ear and then went into the baby's cerebellum through the back of his skull. But that's okay, the parasite is only trying to resuscitate the baby by taking over the functions of the halted cerebellum. I mean sure, if the procedure is successful the baby will grow up to always having to carry the cat on his back, maybe in a Hello Kitty back pack for appearances sake, but that's a small price to pay if you ask me."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fciycc6,t3_ehelis,1577672763.0,"From wikipedia:  

*Granny Weatherwax's reputation even extends beyond species barriers – the Trolls of the Ramtops call her ""Aaoograha hoa"" (""She Who Must Be Avoided""; mentioned in Maskerade), the Dwarf call her ""K'ez'rek d'b'duz"" (""Go Around the Other Side of the Mountain""; also mentioned in Maskerade), and the Nac Mac Feegle call her ""The Hag O' Hags"" (""The High Witch"").*
  
One of the best things about the character of Granny Weatherwax, was that she was somewhat destined to be an evil witch, but because of reasons which would spoil *Witches Abroad*, she, who was extremely self aware, could not allow herself to be evil, and was just a little bit resentful about that."

ColorizedHistory,f9lt6ii,t1_f9l8h34,1575431362.0,"Not political, now, but he's as huge a hero as Zapata, and in the north, bigger. I guess Villa is a more comfortable symbol for the status quo which sees the Revolution as a foundational myth and as completely fulfilled in its aims.  
Every year there's an event called the Cabalgatas Villistas, where a contingent of men ride horseback from other states to the northern state of Chihuahua, in remembrance of Villa, but it's an event completely devoid of any political stance or motivation, deep down it's just a bunch of guy's who like to ride horses and identify with ""the Northern Centaur"", a nickname if Villa."
