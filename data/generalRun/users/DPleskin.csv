todayilearned,fgi10cj,t1_fghu79m,1580800697.0,I'm buying my kids(I never know how to phrase this so here's my disclaimer that they're my ex girlfriends kids 1 from guy before me who I raised from 3 months and never met her dad and is 13 now and pretty much my daughter and 2 from the guy after me who decided drugs were better than kids and never sees them) a nintendo switch. When I order it I'm gonna tell them a switch is coming in the mail and have a random dip switch delivered followed by the Nintendo the next day. I just moved cities for work so I can't do it in person.
gifs,fghnxji,t1_fggxuue,1580789219.0,"Thats a black bear(I know, brown coat, but some black bears are brown) I think. Unless someone corrects. However it it's NOT a ""brown"" bear/grizzlie. Black bears are small but thick. That's probably a 200lb bear that's only a couple years old. It might get a bit bigger but probably not. Wolf is probably a bit over a hundred unless it's a meckenzie, then maybe 120 unless its a *really* big wolf around 140 but thats pretty upper range. And that bear would absolutely destroy that wolf if they were serious. 

Both animals highest parts are probably a bit over average waist height of a person. Bear a little higher on the back, wolf a little higher with the head."
chinchilla,fghn54o,t1_fghj71w,1580788665.0,That's a ridiculous sale.

AskReddit,fgf1ohk,t1_fgea4eb,1580719603.0,I get the forearm thing. It's like when a guy thinks a girl's stomach or legs are sexy. Non erotic parts that show off their fitness. I think the forearms make more sense for the girls as those are working muscles more than biceps are. Look at dudes who work in trades or with their hands alot in physically demanding roles and they'll all have jacked forearms. It shows a dude is fit and can use his hands which makes women feel like they can them safe and provide well both in the world and in the bedroom. Also make a fist and just roll your hand around and watch all the muscles move on the back(top? Same side of your forearm as the back of your hand) of your arm. That's the girl equivalent of a guy watching a girl run without a bra.
AskReddit,fgf1ce4,t1_fge51w0,1580719114.0,"I'm a recovering addict. I never got totally sleezy and manipulative but I definitely was not the person I used to be. Lost a lot of friends especially the type to post FB statuses about checking on your friends with mental illness and helping people recover and blah blah. Most people I know who used to be good friends basically abandoned me. The friends I have left are my *family*. I moved to a new city a week ago and the month before I was staying in a shelter. My best friend helped me move all my stuff to his house and is storing it there, let me stay there the last week before moving and drove me 4 hours to my new city. I love that dude more than I could ever love anyone. Like if it came down to a life or death situation like a trolley problem between him and my wife... It would be a *really* tough choice that, honestly, he would probably win. I'm also 32 years old and still tell me dad I love him every phone call a couple times a week. The Romans had different words for different types of love, brotherly love, friend love, dog love, war buddy love, etc and I *love* that concept. It's different than just being friends with someone when you know you truely love them. Like I feel a little empty without my best friend. Like he's got a little piece of me in his pocket and I can't feel whole unless he's there.

worldnews,fg8rjih,t1_fg8ns8v,1580628546.0,"Again there are personal rights and morals and ethics and they don't always intersect. A society could and as we know, have, enacted racist laws. Obviously I don't believe this is okay, but we are a society and essentially as a society we are a sort of hive mind. Our beliefs as the hive will ebb and flow but if you are a moral and ethical person you find the most ethical ways to exist in those conditions and preferably also influence them positively. Just because the law says owning slaves is okay doesn't mean I have too and if the law says I can establish a white only establishment I can choose to serve whoever I want. But how far can you take this? If you can't force me to do something can you also force me not to? If you're not helping an injured person that you could have helped and had the knowledge too(aside from your example let's say a white ER doctor refuses to work on a black patient) and they suffer from your choosing not to help, that is not inaction. Choosing not to help is in and of itself an action, the act of choosing not to help. So your actions now have harmed someone. By your argument it is your right to harm someone if you choose, so how far can you take that? You could stretch it to say it is my right to murder someone because saying I can't is forcing me to choose not to kill him, the same as forcing you to help the injures guy. As well if I do kill someone whatever punishment is enacted is, certainly going to infringe on my rights. What about war? We say you can't murder to suit yourself individually even if it will benefit you, but the same society will go to war over resources or beliefs so they're saying it's okay to kill to benefit society but not the individual. We all know humanity and societies are flawed. But again we can try to persuade the morals and ethics of those around us, while acting ethically ourselves. Obviously crisis profiteering is not this."
worldnews,fg8msu3,t1_fg8mc4k,1580624728.0,"Well then you need to have a big discussion about what constitutes a right. What if their hoarding and the practices we're talking about from both the sellers raising prices or rich buyers hoarding infringes on my right to healthcare? Some countries consider internet a right. What it comes down to is what we as a society accept as a right as well as what is right and wrong and accepted/viewed as ethical or moral or not. It is simply my personal belief that this is a situation where I find price hiking immoral. Just like when pharma bro hiked prices of his drugs 6000% and people were outraged. I think they should be equally outraged at crisis profiteering. We, as a society, should have a moral imperative to ensure all people get the best aid possible in any crisis situation instead of profiting by limiting it. Basically when you have two options and option A you are still profiting while hurting nobody but incidentally helping by selling a healthcare product and option B you profit more while directly harming people, whether entitled to that action or not, it is unethical. We as a society implement many laws to stop unethical actions. Why should this be any different. There are already laws to stop monopolies, insider trading, etc. Why should crisis profiteering be any different than those? Or fraud for that matter. If I can trick you into giving me money isn't that okay? Ponzi schemes, etc. None of those things technically violate a right but they're all illegal. 

Edit: hit post before done. Everything after ""action or not, it is unethical"" is added."
worldnews,fg8m7ra,t1_fg8k0xc,1580624096.0,I never said they don't. I said it's unethical and immoral. Anybody can do as they please we can still think they're shitty or hold them accountable of it affects society. Laws exist for a reason
worldnews,fg8jon9,t1_fg8j5nk,1580621619.0,"Because it's profiteering off an emergency and stopping access from anyone but the rich. Keeping them at a reasonable rate ensures they will be more evenly distributed amongst varying income levels.  Even if you have a ""that's the way the cookie crumbles"" mentality this is bad for everyone for two reasons. 1) If only those well off can get the masks poor people are left at a higher vulnerability rate when they're already disproportionately more vulnerable than their wealthy counterparts. This will lead to a higher overall infection rate. 2) wealthy people will buy and horde, poor people will buy and use. If you can only buy enough for your family you're going to use those masks if you can afford to stockpile and wait it out you'll probably come out of the other side of this with a surplus of unused masks that could have helped prevent infection spread. 

Overall this prioritizes the health of the few wealthy while endangering the many poor for the sake of profit. It's ethically and morally the same as war profiteering. The best thing would be locking the price at pre emergency rate and placing a cap on the amount allowed per person or household. Rationing. This is what happens with food dueing war time shortages so why not medical supplies during epidemics?"

worldnews,fg84nti,t1_fg84al0,1580609433.0,I understand how supply and demand works. In the LONG TERM they can raise supplies to meet demand but in the SHORT TERM/EMERGENCY price jacking is unethical and supplies run out. People can't just magically create more instant supply just because demand went up and production will increase but not as much as needed when suppliers know demand will drop after the emergency. It is actually in their best interest to keep supply low so they can demand more money. If there was enough supply to meet market demand they couldnt hike their prices. Why make 10 of something and charge a dollars when you could make 3 of it and charge 10 dollars? But I'm sure you already knew that as its basic fundamental economics.
worldnews,fg84cv0,t1_fg7wojq,1580609202.0,Wouldn't this just freeze existing prices? You could still build new and charge whatever for it because it doesn't have a preestablished price right? Or do they have legislation dictating how much can be charged per sq foot in whatever areas or something?
worldnews,fg83k6k,t1_fg80f8b,1580608591.0,That's for long term markets. Price jacking in an emergency when there isn't enough time and/or resources to supply the demand is extremely unethical.

Highlight the warostone, finish detailing and shading the wheels and remaining metal pieces, add more rust around the bolts, shade and detail the red and gold,
I'm also going to get some really gross effects for the base of all my clan pestilens and disease units and splatter it all over all the units. Basically it's going to look like they're rolling/walking through sewage. I'm also going to build some kind of side container for the Skaven on top to be shovelling from for filling the catapult"

ageofsigmar,fdylv8t,t1_fdyiop5,1578781228.0,"Yeah. They're such wonderful kids. I was with their mom when the oldest was a few months old until she was 3 and she turns 13 this year. We broke up amicably. Just better friends than a couple. I helped raise the kid who never met her dad so shes basically my daughter. She had her next daughter and this guy with the dude after me and he ended up being an addict and hasn't been in their lives for about 4 years now and they're wonderful kids too. I love them so much I just don't understand how someone could walk away from them. I am an ex addict myself and they're my main motivation to stay clean. The deleted comments in this thread was someone saying basically ""that's great but don't get cucked"" and it made my blood boil. I hate the idea that people think they need some kind of sexual motivation just to do the right thing for a wonderful family. There's nothing I'll ever do with my life that will be better/more important or make me happier than what I do for these kids. On the down side his sister wanted my bringer of the word to have a brown cloak when the rest of the plague monks were already wearing green robes so I guess all the special units in that group are gonna be brown now haha. Damn kids.

Woops went on a bit of a tangent there the deleted comment just made me really mad"

history,fdx8mt4,t3_en9ys8,1578766373.0,"My grandfather was an English farmer in Saskatchewan when WW2 started. Before Canada joined he went and flew bombers for the British navy. He was shot down very early and spent most of the war in POW camps.(his pow tags are in the low hundreds). During a period of particularly bad rations he wrote home to his uncle and described the meals. A few pieces of bread and water per day. The letter was published and circulated as evidence of poor treatment of POWs. He was unaware of this until guards took him to a private room and ordered him to write a second letter home retracting his other statements. He refused. They brought in some special guards, stripped him naked, threatened him, etc. Eventually his clothes were brought back and one of the higher ranking guards at the camp brought him back to his barracks. Turns out that guard was a German farmer in Saskatchewan who went back to enlist for Germany around the same time my grandpa went. Two humble farmers a couple hundred miles from each other end up together on opposite sides of a war on the other side of the planet. My grandpa figures that man saved his life that day. They became somewhat friends and had dinner together sometimes. 

I know this is r/history and I'm not sure what the rules are or how to cite properly, but the whole story is told in the book One Man's War by Stuart Seward and tells my grandfathers experiences during the war. Probably the most exciting story you could make from a POWs experiences. 
Bonus: Attenborough played an amalgamation character based on him and another man in the Great Escape."
ageofsigmar,fdtjnpt,t3_en2uls,1578717722.0,I just started my first age of Sigmar army. I did 40k as a kid and I'm 32 now and haven't painted minis since I was a teenager. I got the intro magazine that came with this figure but I'm painting a Skaven army. Arlo is my best friend/ex girlfriend's kid and youngest of 3 and they don't have a dad so I do all that stuff with them. It was his sister's bday today and we had a little painting session after presents and cake. I walked his older sister through painting one of my skavens but I let him go ham on this guy.
explainlikeimfive,fds2h1l,t1_fdqxnm1,1578693306.0,"It is about doing something stupid. You would only load 6 rounds and half cock on the way to a gunfight. A standard carry gun had 5 rounds loaded instead of 6 and the hammer rested on an empty chamber. So running off or ""going off half cocked"" means someone is running off hot headed into a bad situation or looking for trouble"
explainlikeimfive,fds22g1,t1_fdqao42,1578693145.0,You got incorrect responses to this. It's because a real gun safety for old revolvers was loading 5 rounds instead of 6. If you were literally on your way to a firefight you would load 6 and half cock. So running off half cocked means you're looking for trouble or running off hot headed.
explainlikeimfive,fdrents,t1_fdqbfqy,1578683490.0,"""going off"" refers to the person. You would load 5 rounds of instead of 6 for a standard safety. You only loaded 6 of you were on your way to a firefight in which case you load 6 and half cock. So ""going off half cocked"" means the person is running somewhere all hot headed or looking for trouble.

explainlikeimfive,fdregux,t1_fdqausn,1578683383.0,"It's not about the danger of the gun. See my other comment. Safety was loading 5 round instead of 6. You loaded 6 and half cocked if you were on the way to a firefight. So ""running off half cocked"" means you're going looking for trouble and are unprepared for the situation. 

Edit: i love downvotes without rebuttal and source: my dad is a competition cowboy shooter and I practice with him shooting pre 1900 revolvers rifles and shotguns regularly"
explainlikeimfive,fdre9eh,t3_emq5ak,1578683258.0,"I see a few comments that mostly get it. The standard safety in an old Six shooter wasn't half cocking it was loading 5 rounds instead of 6. Standard loading procedure is load one round, skip a chamber, load 4 more rounds. When you close the gun the hammer will rest on an empty chamber. You would only load 6 if you were literally on your way to a firefight. In this case you would load 6 and half cock as on a single action revolver half cocking will keep it the hammer off the primer but stop you from firing of the trigger is depressed while unholstering.
