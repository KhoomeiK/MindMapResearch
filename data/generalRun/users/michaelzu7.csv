I got frustrated so many times in the past when people told me to do something i was already starting to do that it killed my vibe, i felt like i was following their command, and now if i fuckup they will come and annoy me with additional commands or even worse.... critique (not the constructive type)."

pcgaming,ffa4z4f,t1_ffa3jmz,1579727985.0,"But Cyberpunk is launching on 16 April is it not? 
But Assassin's Creed Unity was supposed to be launched on PC on the same day as the consoles right?

You know companies can just.... change their mind right? And launching them at the same time does not necessarily mean that the PC version is a downgrade. They (as in CD Projekt Red and other companies that develop games) have to fit their games within the console's requirements (meaning certain GB or RAM, certain clockspeeds etc) while on PC you only need to fulfill the optimization on similar specs or at least *any* hardware that is contemporary (meaning you can go and buy right now). They are not necessarily fitting the games to work at 4k 120fps on a 5year old PC, because that would require a HUGE amount of work for probably not very much gain (people with old or cheap PCs are not guaranteed to all buy the game at full price). 

So they just... make it work good on the hardware that they can, without sinking too much money on this process. Instead of aiming for 8th gen CPU and spend $200K for $40k of profit, they just make the game run as best as possible on 9th gen CPUs.

This is just an example and I'm not familiar with intel CPUs but I hope you get my drift."

Might sound stupid but this is the same logic applied to the ""rested"" feature in WoW.
