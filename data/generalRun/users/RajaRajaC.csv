Mind you in letters to the sultan he accused him of going soft on shirk and the Hindus in general. 

Is this why in various campaigns he explicitly spared Muslim civilians but put Christians and Hindus to death? Like in Georgia he pretty much destroyed every church he found and yet the few mosques on his way he spared?

In Sivas as it put up a month of resistance, he had all Xtians (soldiers and civilians) buried alive while all Muslims (soldiers included) were spared?

The false comparison here is just revisionist nonsense.  In every case where he did slaughter Muslims, it was after the city resisted and fought a siege out and then fell. 

In the case of Delhi (or Armenia or Georgia), captives and even cities which opened it's Gates were sacked.

> Moving further on, the reason the Church played such an outsize role in European polities is because the Roman Catholic church with the Pope as the head was an institution of the Roman Empire. It even has the word ""Roman"" in it. Constantine (or one of the Christian Emperors) split the temporal and religious functions of the Roman state, thus forming, ironically, the first Secular state, and this after the so-called conversion to Christianity which you blame for all the persecution and lack of secular-ness (Arguable point though, and I wont dwell on it). He made the Pope and his representative (a Cardinal) responsible for all religious duties alongside the temporal administrators, the Emperor and his Governor. The provinces were called Dioceses. Where have you head that word before? Oh yes, in association with the Roman Catholic Church. Yes, that's right. The basic units and subdivisions of the Roman Catholic church was the same as the Roman Province. The Roman Catholic church was deeply enmeshed with the local administration and that is why they had a share of the revenue and sometimes, even performed administrative duties like collecting census information about the people in their area of control. That is why births and deaths are tallied at the Church by the Priest. 
Errr, what exactly is your point? That the Church usurped administrative and Judicial powers after Rome became a Christian state? No disagreements here. In fact I explicitly state it as well,

>> and when Constantine officially announced Xtianity as the defacto religion of the Roman state, it became deeply enmeshed within the administration.

Given your pedantry and some deep seated urge to attack me, I must add a disclaimer that this process took a few centuries, lest you say this did not happen overnight hurr durr you are wrong.

> So to say that the Church usurped power by crowning Charlemagne Emperor in 800AD and issuing a Corpus Canonica is ignorant at best and dangerously misinformed at worst.

You seriously cannot read can you? I said,

>> On Dec 25th, 800 AD the balance of power shifted entirely the way of the Church when Pope LEO III crowned Charlamegene (spelling?) the emperor, thus for the first time in Europe, the temporal (physical realm) was now subservient to the metaphysica religious realm. In essence the Pope was from whom all authority flowed, and even the most mighty of emperors was subservient to this ‘servant of God’. In other words, this was when the Church took full charge and was the ultimate arbiter of destinies.

I did not say that the church woke up on Dec 25th deciding to usurp all power, but I SPECIFICALLY phrased it the way I did. There was a balance of power and it shifted the way of the church which is not in dispute at all. It is telling that just 4 years prior to this coronation, the soon to be crowned emperor explicitly placed himself in the services of the church.

> With the help of divine clemency, it is my duty to outwardly defend the Holy Church of Christ by arms from the various attacks of the pagans and the devastation of the infidels and inwardly to fortify her by spreading knowledge of the catholic faith

It is also to be related closely to the forged “Donation of Constantine” which the Church first released around 10 years prior which gave it supreme rights to rule Rome and Italy.

The coronation was a pure power play by the Church and historians including James Bryce are of a very clear and unanimous opinion on this. And it shows, post the coronation and emboldened, Leo’s successor Hardian even lay claim to many duchies in Italy as his personal fief. The Papacy then sequentially now, orders the first crusades where the Church used the armies of the Secular ruler to take land for itself (from heretics). The coronation also was another element the church used to completely escape the authority of Byzantium where the emperor still controlled the church. 

In return for all this support, the Papacy blessed the council of Frankfurt (as a direct counterpart to the second Nicean council in which Charlagmene was insulted by not being invited) and further blessing the outcomes of the council in the form of Libri Carolini (Spelling?), and thus both the Papacy and the Western Empire announced their joint attempt to throw off Eastern supremacy.  That this was planned as such is clear from their meeting a year before in Paderborn where this complex strategic dance was most probably planned however, the contemporary source, Einhard (a friend of the Emperor) explicitly states that then Emperor did not want to be coronated by the Pope, and when the Pope raised this in Paderborn, the Emperor said no because he did not want power to flow from the Papacy to the Emperor and instead wanted it the other way round. 

Einhard says that when the Emperor entered the church on Xmas day, he was not aware of the plot to have the Pope crown him and that had he known, he would have not even gone to church. This was the extent of the power struggle between the temporal and corporeal. 

That there was a power struggle between the Eastern and Western Churches and Empires and within the Western polity a struggle existed between the Church and the State which was resolved (to a certain extent) with the epoch defining moment when Leo crowned Charlemagne (spelling?) To argue against it is stupidity.

As to the rest of your petty attacks, I will leave them aside in the spirit of conversation, but am really intrigued by the same polemical attacks you all use on my persona! I am not a historian, never claimed to be, so attack away, I care as much as Irene did about the Council of Frankfurt which is not at all."

The Second Roman Judean War was actually very similar to how the Rebellion of Vercingetorix started in Gaul – a chain of cities rising up and massacring their Roman garrisons, inviting an invasion by a larger Roman force, which then forced these cities to unite under common banners. 

The third and final war, the Bar Kokhba had a whole laundry list of causes but primarily around incomes and economics merged with the rise of Judean nationalism seen during the Galilee riots. It was only after this third major war in almost 60-70 years that Rome actually cracked down on the Jewish faith, but even this was primarily to end Jewish nationalism (which was at the root of the conflicts) which itself derived its strength from the Jewish faith. 

[Here, read a contemporary and near contemporary to most of these events, a Roman Jew himself]( http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2848) on whose basis I have based most of my claims here on, talk about the freedom of worship the Jews enjoyed in Rome.

This is just a very high level overview of the status of the Jews in Rome and as the 10’s of thousands of Jews who lived in the Jewish quarter in Rome for centuries would testify, their freedom to worship Yavweh (spelling?) was never once impeded, at least not till Christianity became predominant. 




> Constantine the Great was the first Christian Emperor but his immediate predecessor, Diocletian, lead the last, and most brutal, persecution of Christians in the Empire just before Constantine ascended the throne. The Jews and Christians were not persecuted on the basis of their ethnicity. The Roman empire was made up of people from many, many ethnic groups, some of whom even became Emperors (See Septimus Severus, Roman Emperor from 193-211 AD). So no, Religion was the basis of persecution, not ethnicity. The Roman Empire was by no means, ""Secular"" and if you have claimed it was, then the rest of your post is completely incorrect.

Now I do not have the inclination to go on another 5k post on the treatment of Christianity, but the very fact that it took 3 centuries as another ‘cult’ to gain notoriety to reach the level of persecution should tell you a lot. Yes, here a lot of the conflict was in the steadfast refusal of Christians to ALSO worship the Emperor (or Sol or Mitras or whoever) but the issue here is NOT about a denial of rights, as I have elaborately explained in the earlier paras, Roman (and pretty much most religions in the Roman world) were very fluid (like in Dharmic India) and thus adding another ‘cult’ to the worship list was something that was the norm, it was this break from tradition that set up the conflict.

It is also interesting that you chose to overlook the 100’s if not 1,000’s of various faiths (or cults as the Romans would call it) that existed freely, practicing their right to worship freely without fear from the state, propagating freely from at least 500 bce (even the various deities of Latium were alien to Rome) to at least 100 AD when the first recorded persecutions of Christians began.  This is my argument and if you weren’t so hell bent on proving some point, you would recognise it for what it was.

As to Rome being secular, you clearly suffer form very poor reading comprehension as I explicitly state that Rome had an official religion, that it state funded the construction of temples for these gods even. Context being something you are alien to, the secularism comes from the fact that state policy was not driven by the faith, there was no dogma or canon that drove their jurisprudence. Just because a Caesar was the Pontifex Maximus does not mean that he persecuted the Gallic faiths. 

> Coming to the Greeks, ha;ve you forgotten that one of the charges against Socrates was of impiety and introducing false Gods?
And? Again you seem to want to ignore pretty much any context to his trial including his bff relationship with Aclibades (spelling?) whose actions resulted in the deaths of upwards of 50k Athenians and his close relationship with the Spartan controlled Oligarchy that ruled Athens briefly, of whom, Socrates personally mentored? Or is this not relevant at all? And “false Gods”? Please cite this claim as he was accused of impiety yes, which is similar to the blasphemy laws India has. 

Besides, how exactly does this affect the right to worship any god which was the point I was making? India is a secular state, but if you go about idk peeing on the picture of any of the divinity, be it Rama or Jesus, you will see a long stint in jail for impiety, but does it mean India is less secular or not secular?"
IndiaSpeaks,ff8o0ki,t1_ff8f2cj,1579688220.0,"

> Completely wrong. The Roman empire had a state cult with the Roman Emperor being the Head priest and a god himself. He was worshiped as a god and was part of the pantheon of Roman Gods. Any community that would refuse to recognise this was heavily persecuted. 

For someone who makes such absolute statements, taking a 200 odd period in history, completely ignoring the entire Republican period when worship of any living (or dead) man or woman was unheard of and taboo even is definitely odd. Even their gods were essentially humans who were accorded divine or semi divine status. Aside from this, everything of any authority flew from the Senate (nominally, lest you go on a tirade accusing me of ignoring say the likes of the first triumvirate where the senate was mostly a puppet – now that we get into this rabbit hole of pedantry, then we need to talk about the Tribunes of the Plebs and their authority but you get the gist I suppose), and the senate had no official religion (none declared, again lest you go on a pedantic tirade) per se. Rome even at the height of the empire era was known for tolerance and in fact assimilation of what they called ‘cults’, which was nothing but different faiths. Like in Dharmic India, ancient (pre Xtian Rome) has a recorded history of worshiping both the pantheon as well as any local deity of the region, and many a time these ‘cults’ and worship of foreign deities was brought back to Rome either by migrants or Legionairies and thrived just the same. Even the later Gods who would eventually morph into Xtianity and Xtian practices such as the worship of Sol Invictus and Mitras were foreign religions introduced into Rome by assimilation. Mithras for instance which saw a wide following in the later Empire periods was a Zoarastrian (thus enemy of Rome) God! Sol Invictus was possibly a Syrian God aka cult imported into Rome again.
Many of the cults you refer to, founded by various late Imperial era emperors were infact foreign deities that were absorbed into the Roman pantheon. Even the cults of the Emperors were rooted in a polythestic tradition, heck even a normal pater familias (basically every free male at the head of a household) could and did start cults in their own names, so this was an extension of this same tradition. The Princep Senatus’ cult was in general considered the cult of Rome as a mark of respect, but this was only in name and all other cults were given equal space.

Republican Rome even slowly grew (not just geographically) and absorbed Latin cults (Gods) and made it again a part of the Roman Pantheon, it then adapted Greek cults, Syrian, Egyptian all cults found favour with Rome and Romans. I am not sure about Celtic and Gallic cults though, but while they might have not been absorbed (of which am not sure), they definitely were not persecuted. 

The history of cults is far more complex than your simplistic summary, but however you summarise it, freedom for worship for the 100’s of pagan religions and the major Aramic faiths was absolute and never tampered with, and as I have explained briefly, many of these cults were absorbed and became very popular in Rome and Latin Italy as well.
Even these cults were but one of the three elements of Roman (and Greek and Egyptian paganism) Paganism (but you chose to fixate on this because I guess…reasons?). 

* Theologia Naturalis – The Cosmic and natural origins and dimensions of the Gods
* Theologia Civilia – The political side of religion aka personal cults
* Theologia Fabularis – They mythos surrounding religion

> The Jews and the Christians, of course, did not recognise the Emperor as a god and paid the price for it. The Roman state did not run independent of Religion and most certainly did not give everyone complete freedom of choice to worship any religion of their choice. 

What an absurd and ridiculous summary, esp of the Jews. There are established decrees by various consuls during the Republic – Sulla, Caesar, Anthony and later Augustus also specifically created decrees and laws that exempted Jews from things like military service, and respecting the Sabbath 

Caligula who organised the first organised pogrom of the Jews on record executed his own governor Flaccus after Flaccus tried to curry favour with Caligula by placing the statues of Caligula in Synagogues in Egypt, causing a wave of discontent amongst the Jews. The same Caligula 2 years later though did the same thing and when Jews protested, were slaughtered, but then is Caligula guilty of both respecting the Jews right to worship their gods and disrespecting their practices or are the reasons more complex? The same Caligula though never placed statues of himself in synagogues outside Alexandria, why was this so? If the intent was to force Jews to worship him?

Look at the major wars and uprisings between Rome and Judea, note that the first Rome – Judea war was circa 60 AD. Jews had been a part of the Roman Republic for centuries at this point and even lived in Rome in large numbers while Roman Judea was annexed around the time of the Mithirdatic wars, a century prior to the first war. 

* Pompey’s sacking of Jerusalem – Origins were a dispute for the throne between two brothers, which thanks to complicated moves and counter moves resulted in the siege and then sack of Jerusalem – nothing to do with freedom of religion.
* The Galilee uprising – Was a power play by two Jewish brothers, which was triggered when Judea had been declared an official Roman province, they wanted independence from Rome entirely. Nothing to do with religion or freedom of worship.
* The First Roman- Judea war had its roots in the same triggers of the Galilee uprising which was Rome absorbing Judea entirely and depriving it even of the nominal independence it had under Herod. Even after absorbing the province, Rome never interfered with the rights and customs of the Jews. The war in itself burst into the open after a Roman governor stole from the Temple in Jerusalem iirc. Roman governors stole from all temples and cults, and this was not religiously motivated. Even prior to this robbery, the governor took bribes from the Greeks and started ruling against Jews in almost all suits he heard – bribery of Roman governors was again a very ‘secular’ thing, and they usually sold themselves to the highest bidder."

As someone who started AGoT in....1997 as a 17 yo lad and now have a kid who is 8, shit like this used to give me hope till about a decade ago. Now I go ""lol"" and get on with it. At this point I am convinced he has no idea on what to do with his own plot and will just procrastinate till he passes. Look at the gap between his works in this series

GoT to CoK - less than 3 years

CoK to SoS - 18 odd months

SoS to Feast - 5 years

Feast to Dance - 6 years

Dance to TWoW - 8.5 years and counting. 

Unless he has been working on both TWoW and DoS and like CoK to SoS gets them out back to back, there is not a chance either of them get out. 

My only hope as a fan is that like the Wheel of Time, his estate gives his notes and whatever he has written on these along with the plot outline to a capable writer who will end this series for him.

At this point I believe all these ""I got a better ending"" is a pathetic attempt to keep the hype going and milk it for what he can. Mind you I still re-read all his works on occasion and he is a brilliant writer (not a world builder though imho) and I love what he has created but based on what we have seen, he seems to have run out of plot wind."

>So what was this compact the Mahamad Shah Bahamani made? Although Rama sharma doesn't go into the details here, there was a treaty previously between Harihara and the king at Gulbarga that, look at p41


And that's relevant to holding a feast on slaughtering Kaffirs? In what what is this ""compact"" relevant to the feasts held on the slaughter of 20k + Kaffirs?

>>The boundaries of the two kingdoms would go back to where they used to be, each party would refrain from molesting the subjects of the other and that an annual tribute would be paid by Vijayanagar.

How does that negate slaughter? I really don't understand your twisted mind. 

You first pass of battles as examples of slaughter, you then pass of striping of houses of wood as examples of slaughter and now this?

Forget history, you need to read a basic English textbook first. 

>, the army burnt an entire city down for wood and that is not called pillaging or plunder.

Wait, so an army starving for wood (fuel) burns all that wood down?

That's fucking flat out hilarious. This is like idk the Germans starving for fuel in 1945 burning fuel dumps. 

>This is the essential difference between being a historian and an obnoxius gas giant such as yourself.

You must be referring to yourself in this case. 

You are the one desperate to equate Hindu Emperors and Muslim Emperors in barbarity. 

You are the one who thinks (and who despite my pointed questioning, ignores this particular question) that a Muslim barbarian destroying temples and burying the broken idols in toilets and pavements is the same as a Hindu Emperor not destroying a temple but merely shifting one deity and worshipping it for centuries hence. 

You are the one who thinks some treaty being violated justifies a Muslim barbarian from holding a feast every time 20k Kaffirs were slaughtered. 

You are the one who thinks killing of Soldiers = butchering civilians

You are the one who thinks a few exceptional acts of barbarity = the norm (exactly the same logic Nazi apologists use) 

You are the one who thinks stripping a city of firewood as fuel (called foraging and something every army from the dawn of time has done) = burning an entire city down

You are the sick twisted soul whose brain has been so severely whitewashed that you think the allies = Nazis = Japanese. You can deny it all you want but your mental gymnastics prove this unequivocally."

>>So following the Sultan, he overtook him and inflicted a crushing 
defeat. According to Ferista, treachery in the Bahamani camp 
was mainly responsible for this reverse. The result was that 
Deva Raya made a general massacre of the MussalmSns and 
created a platform with their heads on the battlefield. His army 
even followed the Sultan into his own country with fire and 
sword, capturing many places, breaking down mosques and holy 
places and slaughtering the people without mercy.

The first is of soldiers in battle, and then yes, general slaughter.

Then the ""Mussalaman slaughter chronicles"" continue,

>>Being thus disengaged, Ahmed Shah 
set himself first to overrun the open country. In the execution 
of this policy, he broke the temples and destroyed the villages. 
He laid aside all humanity, and wherever be went, he massacred 
men, women and children without mercy contrary to the compact 
made previously by Mahamad Shah Bahamani. Whenever the 
number of the slain amounted to 20,000 he halted for three days 
and made a festival in celebration of his bloody work.

Let me repeat, one of the Bahamani emperors had a feast everytime the number of dead exceeded 20k! But sure, not barbaric at all.

Then we get to the second case of Vijayanagara slaughter,

>>Getting angry 
at this he ordered his vassal at Honawar to kill all those Moors as 
far as possible and drive the rest away. His orders were executed 
and in the terrible massacre that followed, 10,000 Moors lost 
their lives.

Clearly, if you base your argument only on this source, the Muslims had a general practice of butchering civilians, held feasts to celebrate it while Vijayanagara in its entire existence saw 2 general massacres, one of which was of Moors who were trading with the enemy from Vijayanagar territory which in that era definitely meant death.

>I have shown that KDR basically uprooted Bijapur (burnt it to the ground) albeit through his troops. If you read the book further you will realise that ramaraya also entered Bijapur and burnt it down.
