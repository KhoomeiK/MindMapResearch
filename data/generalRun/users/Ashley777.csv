She looked up ""12 year old Asian boys"" and worried for a few weeks about being on a watch list. (I don't think she actually found porn, I wasn't with her, but she said she was uncomfortable afterwards. She was probably just being dramatic.)"
bridezillas,ffj1g9a,t3_etwjpe,1579987991.0,"You said you wanted her to be involved- that can mean so many things. You could ask her to be an usher or just have a day where she goes to help you pick out flowers or something small. You could ask that the maid of honor have her help plan the bachelorette party, or have her help with your hair or nails or whatever. I personally wouldn't have asked someone like that to be involved, but like the others have said, you already did so you just have to figure out how to move on."

breakingmom,fffyjjv,t1_fffcqqo,1579894604.0,"Oh yeah, I absolutely get it. I just meant like that isn't a reason to leave, that's something to be annoyed about, drink wine and bitch to your friends about. It's disrespectful for sure. I used to get irritated because my ex would never close a fucking kitchen cabinet. I didn't at all mean that your feelings about it didn't matter. I would just sling it all off- as if you were getting ready to bang on it but then don't obviously.

Parenting,fekag3u,t3_epj8we,1579195963.0,"I wake my 5 year old up with snuggles. I set my alarm 15 minutes earlier than we need to be up and go get in bed with her. I move around a lot like tossing and turning, quietly asking her if I can lay with her, did she have any dreams, if she slept well, etc. This way she is slowly waking up and then when my other alarm goes off it's time to get up and ready. She is usually fully awake at this point and talking to me about her dreams or whatever. We had trouble with whining too- I'm a yeller so for a while all that you could hear in my house was whining and yelling. So we started the 3 strikes rule. I warn her to stop, tell her to stop, and then I get to yell if she whines a third time. (The 3 starts over if she stops but then starts again later- like more than 10-15 minutes later.) We also got a calendar and each day that she didn't get to the 3rd strike she got to put a sticker on the chart. After 5 stickers I got her a little key chain toy thing. After 10 I took her out for dinner- this was just to encourage us to break our bad habits. After that we kind of forgot about the calendar. The whining and yelling hardly happens now. We also put a black line on days where she did get to the 3rd strike and if she got 3 lines in one day then she was grounded the next day and had to go to bed early. If she got 5 (only happened once) she was grounded and had to go to bed early the whole week."

bipolar,fdsxzlx,t3_emzeja,1578709407.0,"My ex and I have been hanging out and talking about getting back together at some point. We were together for 5 years and have a kid. We talked last weekend and I told him I've been having some episodes and he said he knew. He said he knows how I am during different parts of the year. I never knew he paid attention. He doesn't believe in therapy or medication- says he just doesn't get it, but he loves me exactly the way I am and respects whatever I decide to do to take care of myself and always listens when I need him to. I think that we can make love work but it takes a lot of honesty. We have to be able to hear that we need help or that we have to do something to fix things we might be messing up. It's not fair for us to just say, well, I'm bipolar, I can't help \*thing\*. We have to be better than that. In my experience, as long as a person is trying to do better- any person- then those they love will stick with them. It's when you refuse to take responsibility or try that they start to give up."
