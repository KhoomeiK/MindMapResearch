AskAnthropology,ffgq8j0,t1_fffwf2l,1579912288.0,"I mean I’ve been to Hawaii and I found it borderline unbearable in the middle of the day. We went in March. Early morning and the evening were grand, but I’d much prefer overcast and cool or straight up snow any day. I grew up on the Northeast US and now live in Western Canada."
muacirclejerk,ffgpmrq,t1_fffqo8x,1579911863.0,Wow! Red looks amazing on you. I also like how it pairs with the more subdued eye. 10/10
WTF,ffekmmu,t1_ffdn41d,1579851998.0,"Except for the fact that coronaviruses and influenza viruses are completely different and mutate in different ways. The chances of this strain becoming something akin to the Spanish Flu pandemic are negligible. The closest we’ve gotten to that was the 2009 Swine Flu Pandemic, which just so happens to have been the same type of influenza virus as in 1918 (H1N1). No corona virus that I know of has ever caused cytokine storms. They mostly just act on the upper respiratory tract."
AskAnthropology,ffdmtdz,t1_ffdjtzk,1579824227.0,"It should also be noted that, even thought some of the ancestry of early Native Americans came from western Eurasia, the people living in those areas at the end of the upper Paleolithic looked vastly different from what we consider to be a “typical” Eastern European or Western Asian person."
wholesomememes,ffcp2i0,t1_ffbx6lj,1579804175.0,"Hi yes. Mentally disabled person here. PLEASE, for the love of god, don’t use person first language. It sounds weird, is really obvious, and kinda infantilizing. My physically disabled sister sitting next to me agrees."
Anthropology,ffcnwpm,t1_ffckfnx,1579803468.0,"Aww thanks! I’m just a baby anthropologist (third year of my undergrad), but Paleolithic archaeology is one of my areas of interest."
worldnews,ffciqye,t1_ffbv2zt,1579800335.0,"IMHO, the media is kinda sensationalizing this, as they did with MERS-CoV. Yeah, it’s gonna take a bit of time to really learn about the virus (incubation period, transmissibility, etc.) but it’s not going to be a major global health crisis a la Swine Flu. Corona viruses are one of the viruses that cause the common cold, to put it into perspective. This is just a couple steps more aggressive. And the people who are getting the most sick/dying are people who would be at risk with any major upper respiratory infection like the flu (ie. old people). Of course, I could be totally wrong and it could wipe out the human race."
Anthropology,ffba3db,t1_ffb7st5,1579756927.0,"We divide the time before the beginning of metallurgy but during the existence of of hominin species that used tools into three ages. The Paleolithic spans from about 3.3 mya, with the advent of stone tool use, to the end of the Pleistocene about 12kya. The Paleolithic is further subdivided into lower, middle, and upper Paleolithic. The next age, the Epipaleolithic or Mesolithic, depending on who you ask, is a transitory period from about 15kya (last glacial maximum) to about 10kya (neolithic revolution and development of larger sedentary habitation sites). Finally, there is the Neolithic, which largely corresponds with the introduction of agriculture and the domestication of livestock. Because of this, the Neolithic could begin in an area as early as 12.5kya or as late as 5kya. After this, with the beginning of copper and bronze smelting, we move into the chalcolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. After the Iron Age, we move into recorded history."

wholesomememes,fejj2dw,t1_fejibtt,1579176392.0,"Hand on my heart, I can say my pup (who is a rescue) has rescued me a hundred times over and has saved my life solely because I couldn’t bear to leave her alone in this world. And sometimes being able to see her joy as she play at the dog park or learns a new trick, or seeing her a curled up on my bed is all that I need to put things back in perspective.
