KidsAreFuckingStupid,femboej,t1_felzykm,1579247491.0,"Prior to reddit, a certain porpoise (me) used to frequent an image board called 4 chan. 

On said board was /b, the random section. Started out as edge lords sharing HD porn, shit memes, and roasting each other for being edge lords. 

Back when that was where I got up to my nonsense, this was the kind of stuff you'd see. Grab some crappy memes, see some boobies, be mildly entertained. It started to get real dark pretty quickly so I bailed. Hence the twinge of guilt. Had I known what it was gonna turn into, I'd have stayed well away. 

Think r/gamersriseup. Started innocently enough, is now an actual shit show. 

I legit have no idea if it's still a thing, never looked back. That was over a decade ago, and apparently I'm old."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,felv7vq,t3_eptf81,1579231764.0,The next generation of /b is ready for the torch. Brings me more than a twinge of guilt. WE DIDN'T KNOW! I just wanted to see boobies :(
blackmagicfuckery,feluj2i,t1_felr3ky,1579231275.0,"Also makes you sound like James Earl Jones. Neat stuff.

Oh, and one hell of a green house gas.

Quick edit: Don't mess with it if you don't know what it is. Maybe you can get your physical science or chemistry teacher to show it off if you're interested. (You being the reader, not op) Didn't initially feel the need for the disclaimer, but remembered my ass is on the internet right now."
todayilearned,felhao7,t1_fel7us6,1579222153.0,"Last time I went, you had to check it. At my local dmv anyway, they're pretty adamant about it. Ask you on the paper, then on the little signature tablet thing.  It's irritating. That was almost 4 years ago though, so yay I get to go again at some point! 

If I'm ever in the position where the question matters, I shall not give a single damn. Take em, if you can find a usable bit in this hunk of crap."

It's one of those modern solution things. "" Can't have school shootings if there's no schools!"""
politics,fekq95d,t1_fekppka,1579205365.0,The correlation between education and... everything is pretty nuts. Just an observation.

mildlyinteresting,fekorvs,t1_fekcl8t,1579204484.0,"Cancer is also  not the only thing that gets smokers. Strokes, heart attacks, aneurysms, pneumonia and such tend to be a bit faster than lung cancer. It'll kill you regardless though. It'll give you cancer, but you gotta hit the 65+ average age that becomes the bigger risk in first. Not that it can't get you earlier. 

Full disclosure: Am a smoker. I do make sure to get in various intense exercise daily and eat decently, to maintain above average heart and lung function, but am fully aware that's just a shitty stop gap. 

Was that rather healthy little kid who drew the short straw. Got crazy lucky (spontaneous remission 10+ years ago. Don't count on this, my specific breed had  high occurrence at about 10%. And I'm sure I'll see it again), but ended up a little indifferent toward my personal cancer risk. 

My grandfather (80+) just had an icd put in, has been hospitalized numerous times for pneumonia (which he's somehow managed to survive every time, mostly luck with a bit of that ""fuck you"" attitude)  has been on oxygen for the last 10 years for copd, and albuterol for twice that that. If you ask him, he's needed it from birth, and 65+ years of smoking has nothing to do with it since it's not cancer. It's insane. Love the guy but that's next level denial, and not unusual in older smokers.

My point being, a lot of people, especially smokers, focus way too hard on the lung cancer part of smoking. It's almost total body destruction.  Lung cancer is pretty much the indicator you made it as far as you can as a smoker. There's a lot more stuff in between that can get you a whole lot faster. 
If you're going to make a questionable decision, make sure you are intimately familiar with the results before hand. 

Sorry for the straight up novel. Not directed at you in particular, just the conversation in general. 

Tl;dr: Smoking bad, not just because lung cancer but whole body owies. Shocker,it says it on the box. Those little statements are not just a scare tactic, they're facts, not a conspiracy or blown out of proportion. Read em every time. If you don't like what it says, quit. You've got it, and there's no shame in getting some help.
