gardening,fgmdg05,t1_fgm9tav,1580922428.0,"If your cats like to eat plants, its really not a good idea to grow one that can kill them.

It was so scary and i immediately threw the plant away. Its really not worth the risk. Foxglove *will* kill them"

Rabbits,fgjg6h8,t3_eyv1q6,1580843364.0,"both rabbits need to be fixed before any bonding happens, so youll have to wait until the female is fixed before you can introduce them. they wont truly be bonded until then because of her hormones, and females can get really territorial and sometimes wicked aggressive with other rabbits when theyre not spayed, so id really recommend keeping them apart so neither get accidentally seriously hurt."

Rabbits,fgiahv2,t1_fgi8ft0,1580814102.0,"well just because you didnt see them breeding doesnt mean they werent. rabbits can breed within seconds, its like...what their known for lol. id really recommend taking her to the vet if shes barely eating, because if she is pregnant you need to make sure everything is ok and theyre healthy, but if she isnt pregnant there might be something else wrong. keep them away from each other until both are fixed."
Rabbits,fgi9zy1,t1_fgi8txl,1580813396.0,"lol yeah buns can be picky! and its really good that youre taking her to the vet, i hope she feels better :3

do you mean the floor of the room or of the cage? for the cage i use kaytee carefresh bedding, and for the floor ive seen people use carpet scraps, baby play mats, rubber floor mats (from lowes or something), [coroplast](https://imgur.com/a/nSUO7t6) (im not really sure what this is but ive seen people use it), or [indoor/outdoor rugs](https://tinyurl.com/ux2ckew). if youre using a carpet you just have to keep an eye on them and make sure they dont nibble too much!"
Rabbits,fgi78fa,t1_fgi733w,1580809214.0,"oh ok! well thats good then, i was worried they might have babies on accident lol. but i will like to say that both buns cant be together until luna is fixed too because females can be *super* territorial and she might seriously hurt otis. so spaying her and waiting about a month and then reintroducing them will help her attitude!

spaying them also prevents reproductive organ cancer which can be common and lethal in rabbits. it should help with her litter habits too!"
Rabbits,fgi719l,t3_eynj9l,1580808903.0,is your other bun not fixed? and you put them together?
Rabbits,fgi4ibk,t1_fgi422l,1580805142.0,"even as a treat that food is really bad for them. i also wouldnt recommend any bread, rabbits digestive systems are very sensitive. they arent like rodents like rats that can eat anything. they should have plain timothy pellets, unlimited timothy hay, and fresh veggies every day. fruit only as an occasional treat

a lot of seeds and corn are *not* digestible to rabbits at all and can cause impaction and they can die from it

feed your rabbit only hay, plain pellets made from hay, veggies and sometimes fruit. anything else like crackers, cookies, yogurt drops, seeds, grains, etc, can cause fatty liver disease, cecal dysbiosis, obesity, impaction, gi stasis, and other serious health problems. 

feeding her salad is great though! my bunny really loves dark leafy greens and cilantro!"
Rabbits,fgi37zk,t3_eymhar,1580803422.0,"What a cutie! But i just want to let you know that food is really bad for rabbits. They need to eat plain pellets with no colorful pieces, no corn, no seeds and no grains. Alfalfa-free timothy hay pellets are best"

witcher,fgftj4k,t1_fgft4ft,1580747277.0,Well usually when you validate the files it should replace the missing or changed ones to make the game the original files. Did it not do that?
aww,fgftaku,t3_ey8jrz,1580747130.0,How have they never eaten out of a bowl before? Thats normally how you feed dogs lol
aww,fgft69p,t1_fgfobrk,1580747053.0,"I agree, especially a rabbit. They can get easily stressed out. Im also sick of people bringing their dogs in because they think its cute, but then their dog takes a dump in the produce section or pees on a shelf and its freaking disgusting and rude. And they could distract service animals or scare/hurt people who dont like dogs or are allergic

Horses,fgev248,t3_ey2o04,1580711093.0,"well all animals are different, just because one horse doesnt like you doesnt mean all of them wont like you too! when i was little i got attacked by a huge dog and he bit my face hardcore, but i know it wasnt his fault and i dont blame him, and dogs are still one of my favorite animals. im not able to have a dog yet, but im so excited for the day i finally can adopt. you just have to keep going on until youre in a position to responsibly adopt an animal.
