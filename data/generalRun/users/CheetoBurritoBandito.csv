stopdrinking,fek6zmf,t1_feiqrzg,1579193914.0,"What flavors do you like? I tried an orange one and didnâ€™t like it. Iâ€™m up for different flavors though. 

Itâ€™s funny, people seem to prefer La Croix or Spindrift, but I donâ€™t know anyone who drinks both."

Also, today I learned you guys pronounce and spell aluminum differently."
stopdrinking,feipukg,t3_epcsln,1579144234.0,"I donâ€™t know how to make a badge, but Iâ€™m 10 days sober. 
Today was the worst day yet. I had a series of things happen this evening that would normally have me pouring the vodka. But Iâ€™m downing a La Croix and cruising this subreddit instead. I didnâ€™t drink today!"
stopdrinking,feip3bf,t1_fee97bw,1579143723.0,"No one is a heavy drinker. I think itâ€™s just moms who donâ€™t normally drink who enjoy a drink or two to let their hair down. My biggest drinking temptation is actually at home, so I think Iâ€™ll be ok with my club soda and lime as long as I can have plenty of refills!!"
stopdrinking,feiot9j,t1_fee7knn,1579143534.0,"Thanks for putting into words what I couldnâ€™t describe. I want to fit in and be liked. I used alcohol to deal with my social anxiety, and now Iâ€™m undertaking this whole â€œmaking new friends as an adultâ€ thing without my crutch!"
stopdrinking,feiok0d,t1_feeggy0,1579143361.0,Good point. Thanks!
stopdrinking,feioita,t1_feeaf6p,1579143340.0,"I love the coffee shop idea! Thanks! 
When itâ€™s a group, I donâ€™t think itâ€™ll stand out if I donâ€™t drink. But a couple of women have mentioned it for like a one on one thing, and that would be obvious. But coffee works great. Thanks!"
stopdrinking,fedzxgq,t1_feathku,1579023420.0,Oh I like that. Thank you!

TwoXChromosomes,fcwg5cr,t3_ej56er,1578024761.0,"Just want to say that Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re not blaming each other. 

I had a serious college boyfriend who cheated on me by hooking up with someone who knew people in our friend group. According to these mutual friends, she had a history of looking for personal validation by hooking up with guys that had girlfriends. But honestly, I never had a problem with her. She swore she didnâ€™t know about me, but that part never really mattered. I didnâ€™t know her, and she didnâ€™t know me. Who cares if she even knew OF me? Sheâ€™s not the one whoâ€™d committed to me. She didnâ€™t promise to be faithful. She didnâ€™t ask me to be her girlfriend and talk about marriage. HE DID. HE wronged me. We ended up becoming friends. She was a blast to hang out with!!! 

Weâ€™re all in our mid-30â€™s now; all married to other people, and her and I each have kids. And I look back on it with gratitude that we were able to place the blame where it should be. Heck, she got me out of a bad relationship which freed me up to start dating my husband! 11 years of marriage and two kids later, I can safely say I owe her a lot!!"

AskLosAngeles,fc999p6,t3_egrymi,1577549092.0,Yes. We have medi-cal and my husband and I both did sleep studies recently.
TrueChristian,f9dy6k6,t1_f9cvhsz,1575237929.0,"My husbandâ€™s family is from Syria, and theyâ€™re orthodox Christian. He told me that, to the best of his knowledge, itâ€™s a phrase that only Muslims use."
