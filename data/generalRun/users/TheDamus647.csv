WatchPeopleDieInside,fgni922,t1_fgn568h,1580945441.0,IMO Hamilton lost in China when his team didn't pit him until the canvas of his tire was showing. Them Hamilton didn't/wasn't able to slow down on pit entry. First and only time I recall a tire being so worn the canvas showed.

Hamilton,fgagsq1,t3_ex9xbq,1580651017.0,"I work in HVAC and am my company's primary service technician. In the rare event I misdiagnose something that is on me and my company. The fact that they are trying to charge you again for a fucked up repair is bullshit. They are a big company as well. Tell them to reinstall the old part for free and fix it properly or you should be entitled to a full refund. 

You already paid to have it fixed. They fucked up. If they refuse and you paid with a credit card dispute the charge with your credit card company and tell the HVAC company to settle it in small claims court. They won't bother. Also, take it up with the better business bureau. 

They are a massive company as well. That blows my mind."

Sous vide won't cause proper malliard process to occur during cooking. So no, it won't taste good. It was taste ok, *look* good and be needlessly chewy."

Hamilton,fellm7q,t1_fek4k5w,1579225110.0,Part of why they pay into the union is to have an income during a strike. I can't say in this specific case as they are one day affairs but in longer strikes most unions pay a partial wage at least during strike times.

movies,fe9ktpd,t1_fe9kpsp,1578938763.0,I don't think it is malicious. I think they aren't capable appreciating a diverse crowd.
movies,fe9jlna,t1_fe9i8hb,1578938257.0,"I believe that a bunch of old white men (even after diversification a couple years ago) perhaps aren't the best to choose these things. The Golden Globes was the same shit. Gervais made a joke about how white it was and the camera pans out to an almost completely white crowd. 

I don't understand why they don't have a rotating selection of members who vote. Expand the pool to include criteria that if you have over 20yrs in the industry with over 20 credits to your name (these numbers are a very rough example picked out if the air) you can apply to be a member. No one member should be allowed more than two or three years nominating. That can only be a good thing for diversity. 

J lo or Aquafina (really both) deserved a nomination for example."

Amd,fdgrh18,t1_fde3kcn,1578406419.0,"As amazing as this sounds it would be a logistical nightmare. The optics of selling a cpu that is supposed to come with a cooler but doesn't have to except they are back ordered is bad. How as a company when you are having these parts manufactured with months of lead time would you predict how many to need? If you assume 50% of users will take the stock cooler and 70% do in the end you are screwed. Likewise, if you assume 50% want it and only 30% do you are now sitting on hundreds of thousands minimum worth of coolers."
