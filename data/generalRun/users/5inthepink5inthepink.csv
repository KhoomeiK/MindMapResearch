In a case of hypothetical total socioeconomic collapse these nuts are preparing for, there isn't ""always"" someone with extra food, or at least someone with extra food with whom you can communicate and physically reach. 

It may be that you lack understanding of the extent of collapse that's possible if an entire nation or even region loses its food and utility distribution mechanisms (e.g., in the event of nuclear strikes, EMP, or other mass infrastructure-destroying events). In such a case, which is primarily what the TEOTWAWKI crowd are preparing for, there would be no means to reliably find and travel to suppliers of necessities who would be willing to take gold. 

If not, I'm open to an example that proves otherwise."
news,fdj6dh2,t3_elmcbv,1578459711.0,"I've never understood why people think gold will be worth fuck-all in the event of societal and economic collapse.

In the event of a societal collapse, which is why these people are buying up gold and silver after all, a barter system may develop, but it's going to be bartering for things people need to survive, not rare metals."

Unless/until we adopt a more representative system, a vote not placed for one of the two-party candidates is as good as a vote for the other. This isn't how it should be, but it's how it is, and people need to educate themselves enough to understand that - and advocate for a better system.
