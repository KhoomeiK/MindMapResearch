We have guns for personal protection, but we don't go down to voting sites to defend the rights of marginalized communities to vote? Why? Because we've been lead to believe that those marginalized communities are the reason we need guns to defend ourselves.

As long as they can keep use pointing the guns at each other they are cool with making bank off of us and using our associations to push regressive and repressive agendas under the guise of defending our rights to bare arms."

If we all stopped going to work and straight marched into the capital building in DC and dragged everybody in the building out into the streets and murdered them all, we'd be giving the Cia and all the other letter agencies a real object lesson.

Thenbwe don't return to work until we've voted in replacements who would then replace every head of every agency and install a civilian oversight council.

I mean some of us would get fired, or arrested or die, but for the most part we'd get what we want and send a warning to the government. Rinse and repeate every 20 years or so per the founding fathers."

Then that notice would trigger a review, which would unfold no less than 3 meetings between the school district and state department of Ed. Then there would be further action needed to send the escalated request to the vendor. Then the blurred video would have to be reviewed and rereviewed before receiving approval for a draft to be sent to the state board of ed, and their legal department, and the municipality's board of Ed and their legal department. Enter a few back and forths between all those parties and then a other request for further blurring to the vendor. Then another round of reviews and then finally a release to the local school district for maybe one more review before being released to the parent.
