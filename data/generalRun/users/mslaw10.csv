dogpictures,fbzbb0r,t1_fbz7p9k,1577241000.0,Donâ€™t know for sure. Iâ€™m leaning more towards lab. Iâ€™ve had a lab before and she has a lot of lab tendencies.
dogpictures,fbzb91b,t1_fbz3q4u,1577240948.0,Thank you!!
dogpictures,fbynaic,t1_fbym18s,1577221273.0,"Agreed! I donâ€™t have any negative people in my life (well I do because theyâ€™re family, but I donâ€™t talk to them). 
Iâ€™ve had two miscarriages in the last 4 months and my boyfriends best friend committed suicide. :( 
Itâ€™s been a sucky few months. 
Ginger is to help heal our hearts and move forward ðŸ’—"
dogpictures,fbyfc56,t1_fbyetj7,1577215480.0,Thanks! :)
dogpictures,fbydy5a,t1_fby7dw9,1577214481.0,"100% agree! This is my first dog of my own, but I grew up with a family dog. He passed away from old age in February. :( 

Iâ€™m excited to give Ginger the life she deserves! ðŸ’—"
dogpictures,fbxhajq,t1_fbxbh43,1577187426.0,Sheâ€™s so gorgeous!!! Thank you!
dogpictures,fbxh9tt,t1_fbx09xq,1577187396.0,I donâ€™t know this reference. I better look it up lol
dogpictures,fbxh8yt,t1_fbx14uk,1577187363.0,Sheâ€™s my light at the end of a dark tunnel. The last 6 months have been quite rough. Iâ€™m excited to have a cuddle buddy.
dogpictures,fbxh6v4,t1_fbwzkv3,1577187276.0,I will definitely do that!
dogpictures,fbxh5vr,t1_fbx8bdx,1577187238.0,"Her papers said sheâ€™s a Blue heeler mix. My guess would be lab, as well!"
Miscarriage,fbkgmki,t1_fbkfw5e,1576950020.0,"Thank youðŸ’— Iâ€™m sorry that youâ€™ve had to go through this as well. Thereâ€™s really nothing that anyone can say to make the hurt feel better. 
Iâ€™m hoping my doctor will give me some advice on Monday. Itâ€™s hard knowing Iâ€™m still technically pregnant and my body isnâ€™t catching on to whatâ€™s happening."
