AskReddit,ff3e1c9,t3_er9gj0,1579539200.0,We could fit the entire world's population in the state of Texas with the same amount of people per square metre as Manhattan. Overpopulation isn't an issue because so much of the world is not populated. Not sure about a declining population being the issue either. I think the issue is how badly proportioned the world's wealth is.

insaneparents,fdgwocc,t1_fdgbl1n,1578410178.0,"Conversion therapy is essentially forcing people to be straight. They use a variety of things that they believe work, such as looking at straight porn, learning how to be more masculine, even being forced to have sex with the opposite gender. They also can use physical methods, such as beating, even electroshock therapy. It is illegal in most states due to the physiological and psychological trauma it causes to the victims. 

Also, it doesn't work."

aww,fdeqkx0,t1_fdek2gg,1578344544.0,I believe people like that should also be put down. Putting animals' lives in jeopardy(and killing them) should be brought with a similar punishment to repeated murder.
aww,fdeq7rx,t1_fdenwsv,1578344327.0,"NO. The strain of chlamydia is a completely different strain to human chlamydia. You could even use your genitals to pick up the koala, as suggested by another redditor, and you would have absolutely no chance of catching it."
TransSpace,fdemgsx,t3_eko91r,1578342130.0,"I have been in the same situation as you. I'm a trans guy, and I'm a junior in high school. For me, when people approach me with hate in person, I just ignore them and try to take to heart that I am brave and strong and not what they are calling me. Sometimes I will ask them why they say that, and it helps me to realize that their comments show their character more than mine.

If it is online, I approach the person with as little rudeness as I can and try to find out the reason they are saying that. Oftentimes, they don't see the flaws in their argument and all they need is a bit of a deep-dive into why they are saying such ridiculous things. I've been able to get through to some people, but oftentimes its better to leave the issue alone rather than spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to convince someone you're valid. 

So basically, try not to take their insults to heart. Their comments say more about them than you, and the people who will stand up to their comments or at least support you through it will come out the woodworks. If you feel they'd be able to change, you can try. If you do, try to avoid insults, but you also don't owe people an education about yourself. I hope this has helped. I feel for you, as I was in the same boat. Try to remember your situation is always temporary and WILL change, good or bad."
