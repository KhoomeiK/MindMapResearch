This is like a used sex shop in that it always gives me bad vibes. Case in point:

> running an Adventurers League game

> dude arrives wanting to join

> ask him if he has a character in mind

> he tells me yes

> i ask to see his character sheet

> he hands me it

> from first inspection it seemed alright

> guy wanted to play a Teifling sorcerer with a noble background

> name was Sir. Bastian Michaelis

> but then it all started to go awry when i saw his stats

> Nat 20 in all stats (character was level 3)

> movement speed of 100m (What!?)

> no weapons, instead used bare hands which did 3d20s and had a +12 to hit

> it was at this point where I was just reading to see how fucking ridiculous it can get.

> hp was 800

> had proficiency in every skill

> had 500m of true sight

> knew every language

> was a shapeshifter

> resistance to everything

> it was like i was holding a sheet of a DMPC

> i then noticed he had a picture taped on the back of the sheet

> curiosity made me flip that shit over to see what it was

> and there, taped on the back of the sheet was a lewd picture of Sebastian from ""black butler"".

> it was at this point where i started to break down laughing

> once i got my shit together, i told the guy that he would need to rework ALL his stats in order to play.

> he got butt hurt, told me that im a shitty DM, told me to go fuck myself, and then left.

> im still laughing at the obsurdity of it.
