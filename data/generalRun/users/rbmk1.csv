Truth is, by that time it was going to be over for Germany, successful D-day or not. The Soviets were rolling. The allies still had a foothold on the continent. It may have prolonged the European war but Germany, by 1944, outside of some miracle, was never going to win. Besides, sooner or later we would've dropped an A-bomb on them, game over man.
