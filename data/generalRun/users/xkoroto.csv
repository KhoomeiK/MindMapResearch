That would be true if all beings were able to debate about that but the only thing I see are humans judging what's bad and what's good and especially judging as good the things they can feel less empathy about.

>The relevant difference here is that plants are not sentient.

They are sentient, when you touch certain plants, they react in a protective way. You say sentience and reaction is not the same but it is actually the same unless you can become a plant then get back and tell us how it feels. Again, a problem of empathy.

>Killing and eating humans would lead to plants prevailing way more.

Incorrect, agriculture, driven by humans ensure plant survival and proliferation in the most intensive way ever. We could even terraform Mars and make it green. It's the same for animals: the more humans there are, the more animals are born to feed us.

>Nature and evolution have no will.

They have, they pick what's more prone to survive. Evolution wanted humans to exist by making primates eat meat rather than vegetables, that are hard to digest. Antropomorphing Evolution is just a literary non scientific way to explain it. 

>you can do vegan keto.

Humans have not evolved to be vegan. Cows have evolved to be vegan, well, not even, besides grass they sometimes eat insects and small mammals. I cannot think of a 100% pure vegan or carnivore organism on this Earth. Veganism is a radical attitude from minds trying to fight biology. 

>Firstly, this is just incorrect, animals industrially farmed face extreme pain and distress throughout their lives and killing almost always involved extreme terror and suffering. 

That has to change and will change, especially if we stop mass producing corn, rice, wheat and we recover the wild grass lands where cows, pigs and chicken used to enjoy freedom. 

>If you're concerned with animal suffering you should be vegan.

I can do both, be omnivore and improve animal life quality. There's no need to be that radical.

>it wouldn't matter whether they are killed without suffering the act of killing is itself wrong.

If you're starving in the forest and the only food source available is a deer, would you kill it with horrible suffering because ""it wouldn't matter""? Camon... Killing for food is right and a right. Predation existed since billions of years ago and allowed more complex organism to exist. Of course I can put myself in the skin of a cow, but I'm not a cow, I'm at the top of the food chain, I am king. The best I can do is to be grateful and treat them well until we find a way to grow muscles in a lab.

>Plants can't feel pain

Not animal pain, but maybe plant pain, you don't know that. Again, your empathy bias makes you treat plants like shit."

>Humans harm other living creatures even more and have moral agency so wouldn't it make even more sense to eat them?

Incorrect, humans kill animals to eat in the most unconscious way possible. That make us better than a lion brutally killing, torturing and eating a cow or a chiken eating an insect or a rat alive. We promote their existence and then we kill them with no suffering (except some cases). What we must do is to reduce carbs production so there's more wild grass fed animals living more happy lives.

I don't, I trust Evolution and accept I have to kill other creatures to eat and live. That's how primates evolved into us. Am I proud of that?

It's true the illusion of control correlates with happy people but sooner or later you realize it's an illusion and that the environment sets your goals and desires.

Or you can do what you judged ""good"" and get ""bad"" consequences like so many utopists did in the past...

That would be true if all beings were able to debate about that but the only thing I see are humans judging what's bad and what's good and especially judging as good the things they can feel less empathy about.

>The relevant difference here is that plants are not sentient.

They are sentient, when you touch certain plants, they react in a protective way. You say sentience and reaction is not the same but it is actually the same unless you can become a plant then get back and tell us how it feels. Again, a problem of empathy.

>Killing and eating humans would lead to plants prevailing way more.

Incorrect, agriculture, driven by humans ensure plant survival and proliferation in the most intensive way ever. We could even terraform Mars and make it green. It's the same for animals: the more humans there are, the more animals are born to feed us.

>Nature and evolution have no will.

They have, they pick what's more prone to survive. Evolution wanted humans to exist by making primates eat meat rather than vegetables, that are hard to digest. Antropomorphing Evolution is just a literary non scientific way to explain it. 

>you can do vegan keto.

Humans have not evolved to be vegan. Cows have evolved to be vegan, well, not even, besides grass they sometimes eat insects and small mammals. I cannot think of a 100% pure vegan or carnivore organism on this Earth. Veganism is a radical attitude from minds trying to fight biology. 

>Firstly, this is just incorrect, animals industrially farmed face extreme pain and distress throughout their lives and killing almost always involved extreme terror and suffering. 

That has to change and will change, especially if we stop mass producing corn, rice, wheat and we recover the wild grass lands where cows, pigs and chicken used to enjoy freedom. 

>If you're concerned with animal suffering you should be vegan.

I can do both, be omnivore and improve animal life quality. There's no need to be that radical.

>it wouldn't matter whether they are killed without suffering the act of killing is itself wrong.

If you're starving in the forest and the only food source available is a deer, would you kill it with horrible suffering because ""it wouldn't matter""? Camon... Killing for food is right and a right. Predation existed since billions of years ago and allowed more complex organism to exist. Of course I can put myself in the skin of a cow, but I'm not a cow, I'm at the top of the food chain, I am king. The best I can do is to be grateful and treat them well until we find a way to grow muscles in a lab.

Incorrect, humans kill animals to eat in the most unconscious way possible. That make us better than a lion brutally killing, torturing and eating a cow or a chiken eating an insect or a rat alive.

Well, that's not True from my perspective. Our cognition and behavior are linked to a huge set of hormones, genes, external factors etc. Besides that, the slave becomes the master because without slave there's no master. It's true the illusion of control correlates with happy people but sooner or later you realize it's an illusion and that the environment sets your goals and desires.

>you may intentionally shape your life and those of others for better or worse.

Or you can do what you judged ""good"" and get ""bad"" consequences like so many utopists did in the past... At the end you can see nobody knows what's better until it's done so what survives, wins and/or reproduces must be the ""good"", at least in the present moment.

Si se resisten, pues a hostias, si ayudan y hacen bien su funciÃ³n, pues aliados.

Cuando alguien es mejor que tÃº en algo, intentas ser su amigo y que se te pegue lo bueno que tiene (si quieres)."
thelema,fd1o6y6,t1_fczbcco,1578134158.0,"Yeah, mind in words cannot apprehend it, you cannot say ""cold"" and ""hot"" and the same time neither be ""up"" and ""down"" at the same place so maybe that's why Einstein associated the mind with time, as if it was a cognitive illusion (after taking psychedelics, it seems so). The Will is to me a ""verbal representation"" of Universal Causality that you cannot put in your mind as a whole because the temporal limitations I was talking about, but you can feel it and try to approach it, especially by meditation, by flowing in a Wu Wei form.

Besides all these hardly empirically things to graps, I simply find very comforting the idea that, when something goes ""wrong"" (actually, it's when ""my mind judges things as ""bad"" rather than a pure objective universal definition of bad) to think it's The Will of the Universe in action so why bother, why fight. I feel better if I do that and things become easier. That, again, makes sense in a temporal perspective, because Evolution ends ups deciding what's the surviving paradigm and the Mind cannot travel into the future to know if an action is the choosen one to push it to the next step.

Added to that, it's obvious to me that my mind works far better while on meditation and or when I flow (you can meditate playing tenis you know). For example: your steak will not be properly cooked if you're worried about X thing and out of the present moment and action.

Soooooo yeah. Hard to grasp in words all this thing is..."
ketoscience,fd1mw46,t1_fd00gz6,1578133553.0,"Add to that the sleep problems carbs induce like frequent napping and not being able to wake up in the morning: that's the main reason why people is addicted to caffeine, alcohol, weed and sleep pills. Since I do keto, I wake up in the morning no matter what and I sleep like Zeus, I don't nap and my cravings on caffeine, alcohol, weed, even psilocybe cubensis (that is not addictive but I no longer feel the urge to do them once a month) have gone.

So, enemies of keto: carbs industry, caffeine industry, big pharma, probably weed industry, alcohol industry... I mean, there are billions of profit in danger if population gets healthier for some people."

My guess is that there's something going on with blood sugar that messes sleep and that's why you napp after eating and them you can't sleep because you're starving etc. Who know. What I surely know is that since I started keto two months ago, I sleep at night like most humans, that's a miracle after years doing the opposite."
