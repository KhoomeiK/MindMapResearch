books,ffowaus,t3_eubud2,1580082537.0,During the summer my son and I went probably 10 times(not much but the library is far away). In the last ten years I’ve done none of those other things.
AttachmentParenting,ffn7ltf,t1_ffjsz8u,1580062849.0,"I like this, I like it a lot. I’ve used it no running zones where my son naturally wants to run. We go back and walk, over and over again."

BabyBumps,fff8hwv,t1_fff7nt1,1579878349.0,"You are going to be a great mom. I think how you feel about these messages is valid. It’s also normal to feel hormonal about things but I 100% don’t feel comfortable when a spouse is talking about their s/o, which he probably isn’t doing but unfortunately he isn’t talking about it. Idk other than calmly explaining how you feel- which comments made you uncomfortable and why, and that you’re not uncomfortable with their friendship, just uncomfortable with the secretive nature of it."
PregnancyAfterLoss,fff61xv,t1_ffeyjzz,1579876625.0,"There are two or three babies that I see at parent pick up, when I pick up my four year old. Those babies are exactly as old as my baby should be. I was at panera and some parents were complaining about their babies- babies that were as exactly as my baby should be and I just wanted to cry. I kept telling myself I wouldn’t be pregnant right now if we hadn’t of lost this baby but it doesn’t help. I don’t know I’d cope if I were you. I’m sorry."
BabyBumps,fff5c9c,t3_et9ebn,1579876099.0,"I wouldn’t mind my husband texting a friend who happens to be pregnant but the “are you scared??” comments are undermining then the “nothing I’d talk to you about” comment from your husband is uncalled for and nasty. 

She’s a friend not a wife. I’d be uncomfortable with this and ask to see the conversation or an explanation about the comments. My husband has had females message him and I went through the messages and though he didn’t see the problems when I pointed certain comments, he understood."
BabyBumps,fff4e6d,t3_et3c2o,1579875399.0,Everyday my husband comes homes and takes his socks off on the couch and they disappear into the void. It’s a heavy couch so it’s an adventure to get them out. I think this is great.
moderatelygranolamoms,fff30m2,t1_ffezuww,1579874333.0,I have no idea! It was so fascinating for mine until he realized people poop in there. We bought some really annoying strap to keep him out.
homeowners,ffetkac,t1_ffehjuz,1579864876.0,"We failed to file our tax exemption for the first year, we filed the second year. Our mortgage had gone up pretty significantly. This year we got the new exemption, and the mortgage company refunded us $900. Is this why? I’ve been concerned it was a mistake and we will have to pay it next year."

PregnancyAfterLoss,ffdgb1c,t3_et0cof,1579820265.0,I had massive anxiety with my first. I didn’t buy ANYTHING. I was ordering stuff from the hospital bed (had baby early). It did get easier in the pregnancy. I just ordered my first pair of maternity pants but I’ve been my sisters and they’re way too tight. It’s hard to look at baby stuff this early but I think it will get easier.
PregnancyAfterLoss,ffdflfi,t3_esz622,1579819845.0,"My symptoms amplified at 8 weeks. I really didn’t have any that early. I had a MMC you don’t stop having pregnancy symptoms suddenly, so probably due to moving. Also call the numbers the other poster provided for Tricare."
homeowners,ffct3h7,t1_ffcrtzk,1579806702.0,They’ve got an unfixed male and female! Yep! My husband told me they were calling the male “crazy”. It’s so infuriating.
beyondthebump,ffcqpwv,t1_ffcq5gb,1579805263.0,"He felt bad about it, I literally don’t remember the conversation but he went and got a lactation consultant to help and told her I was overwhelmed and felt like everyone knew more than me (she was coming off like a B) and that I needed someone to make feel like an expert."
beyondthebump,ffcpwt4,t1_ffc4wxp,1579804726.0,"Apparently while I was on a magnesium drip after just delivering, several nurses tried to teach me how to make baby latch. I have zero recollection of this... I did tell my husband that line you used when he tried to help. Two days later the pediatrician told me that you’re body doesn’t always make milk when your baby is born early and taught us how to use formula."

homeowners,ffcn14f,t1_ffclwxf,1579802923.0,"We have a wooden privacy fence and the neighbors are looking at replacing it with a sturdier fence. The problem is the dogs are bored and can dig underneath. The fence that is there was a privacy fence but you could still see through it, we added more panels to prevent that. 

Most pit bulls aren’t like this- but when you have bored unfixed dogs that are young, it can be difficult. Plus they put bark collars on them, so they can’t bark, they go straight to growling. So we have two growling pit bulls on the other side of the fence and we are the other side. It makes me nervous, we have a fantastic backyard and we can’t have friends over."
beyondthebump,ffcln17,t3_estz7y,1579802081.0,I totally feel you. It seems like you don’t have a super happy story or a MIL to bitch about you’re not welcome.
homeowners,ffcdfob,t1_ffccay0,1579797065.0,"Honestly, I hope they understand that I can’t allow an aggressive pit bull near my children. My husband went over and had a calm conversation with them. We had a camera recording the incident, so it wasn’t a he/said she/said situation."
homeowners,ffcaee9,t3_esubjj,1579795166.0,I wished we would have walked the fence lines. It may not have made a difference but they have an aggressive pit bull and we have a young child and an elderly german shepherd. Their dogs constantly attack our fence line when we are outside. They bite our dog through a whole they dug under the fence.
BabyBumps,ffc9zu3,t1_ffc9iui,1579794913.0,"Yes, they are! The only thing I had was jello. It’s been 4.5 years and I’m still annoyed by it."
BabyBumps,ffc7pf9,t3_esqzth,1579793452.0,My baby was born 5 weeks early and did not cry. We had to set alarms to feed him. It was difficult. My recommendation is to figure out who delivers food to your hospital. They didn’t let me eat from the check in date and I gave birth an hour after dinner and no one cared that I hadn’t eaten for 3 days and they expected me to feed a baby immediately.
BabyBumps,ffc7fs0,t1_ffboth7,1579793279.0,My mom was over that first night. I woke her up and made her hold him for two hours.

PregnancyAfterLoss,ff92683,t3_esbgsm,1579702997.0,"Talk to your doctor, is it a peer reviewed article? I tried to follow some diet with my first pregnancy and ended up with pre-e. Doctors aren’t pushing it, so I honestly wouldn’t worry about it."

toddlers,ff6q1y2,t3_erud8z,1579632499.0,"My son decided last year he wasn’t going to poop anymore. We had some medical issues that we resolved but he was dead set on pooping period. My son & I created a sticker chart and each time he poops he gets a sticker, after 5 he gets ice cream. It’s been three weeks and his attitude is now “everyone poops”."
toddlers,ff0m1lw,t3_eqwgmg,1579470177.0,"At the beginning it looks kind of like that, they’re basically getting comfortable with you and your son and setting up a routine. This was lead into services when he’s three through the school district. My son’s three year old teacher taught him sign language. It was extremely helpful and pretty easy to catch the hang of, it helps communicate immensely. We also did private speech therapy and thankfully medicaid paid for it."
BabyBumps,ff0gwoc,t3_equz75,1579468777.0,"This is my third pregnancy- we had a miscarriage in the second trimester in March of 2019. I feel like I spent most of 2019 pregnant and in the first trimester and both experiences were progressively worse than the previous. The second pregnancy the OB put me on progesterone and I felt like that amplified the first trimester 1000x. I don’t know if just gets worse with every pregnancy or what but I don’t think I could handle it again. It was horrible. There were days when all I could do was sleep. 

That being said the second trimester is magical for me. I had an anterior placenta with my first and he just wasn’t as active as this baby who lets me know she’s ok every few minutes."

PregnancyAfterLoss,fetfe69,t3_eqjv7e,1579374901.0,My first pregnancy was with a CNM and pretty much went how you described except they were incredibly negligent in my car. I’m using a very patient ob-gyn who is male and he’s the most patient doctor I’ve had. I think you should find someone who you trust.
