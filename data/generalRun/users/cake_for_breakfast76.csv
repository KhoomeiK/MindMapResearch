vaporents,ffh9pf3,t1_ffh6aee,1579927197.0,"It may depend on a few different things, like how much you 'used up' your bud while vaping. These pills are pretty large as far as pills go, and I find 2 is a pretty nice high, and 3 is pretty strong."

vaporents,ffgvvsj,t1_ffgkvlk,1579916391.0,These pills have always worked pretty well for me but maybe I'll start making a point of eating something fatty along with them.
vaporents,ffgvrbq,t1_ffgtinq,1579916302.0,"One of the reasons I like these pills is that I can control the dose. 1 pill I can feel but function, 2 pills is fairly strong, 3 pills and I'm useless for a while."
vaporents,ffgvejf,t1_ffgoax6,1579916041.0,I find that 2 pills is pretty strong. 3 pills and I'm nearly comatose.

nba,ff7yp1k,t1_ff7j9rd,1579661526.0,"I would love to see that even if he can't do anything crazy. I don't buy the idea that it would tarnish his reputation. If anything the fact that he could still compete and throw down, say, a solid reverse alley oop, at 40 is a testament to his greatness and would add to his legacy."

science,few8klq,t1_feui0lw,1579406916.0,Canadian here. I've got 2 kids and we took them both home for the low low price of $0. It baffles me that Americans will still argue with me that their medical system is better for the average person than what we've got going on up here.

dataisbeautiful,fcr0czk,t1_fcqw6tn,1577894913.0,I recall hearing that the 'normal' range varies from a poop every 3 days to 3 poops a day. People differ pretty wildly. I too very rarely go a day without pooping.
Showerthoughts,fcqp992,t1_fcqbq3w,1577889954.0,Imagine it's the 90's and some old fart is trying to tell you that you can't call it the 90's because that term is reserved for the 1890's.
