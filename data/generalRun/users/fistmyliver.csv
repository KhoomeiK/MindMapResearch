cranes,ffrkhm8,t3_eutb04,1580159888.0,Im a apprentice mobile crane op..my advice is when you get started as a apprentice dont expect seat time.  If it happens take it and listen to what the journeyman is trying to tell you.  Even if you already know it just shut up and listen.  I have gotten a lot of seat time as a first year in some fairly big cranes and its because im willing to learn and take criticism.  I have seen other new apprentices quit because they show up expecting to sit in a warm dry crane all day and get pissy when they are tasked with bitch work.

Yes, the husband is a scumbag but her ending up with almost all of the properties seems pretty wild.  I know people that divorced because there wife cheated and its still the woman that ends up getting the better deal.  Shit i remember one of my friends divorced his wife because she refused to work.  He told her he wanted out of the marrage and she beat the shit out of him.  He left the house and called the police, when the cops showed up they found her waiting with a fucking crow bar.
