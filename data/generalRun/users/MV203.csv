Wellthatsucks,fgnay90,t1_fgn7npi,1580941069.0,"Hm, sorry for the misinformation. Thanks for the info! I think I may have read a lot of the defendants walked though.. Something about ""wanting to put the past behind"".. a great many nazis did not get charged."
Wellthatsucks,fgn1khf,t1_fgmylq8,1580935928.0,Interestingly most of the nuremburg defendants got off Scott free with that defense.

SandersForPresident,fgm4xxc,t3_ez6uyo,1580918068.0,Yes!! We need Bernie telling America what is really happening! Not what the GOP *says* is happening. I'm hoping that the GOP destroys what little credibility they have left by the end of this election.
SandersForPresident,fgluhea,t1_fglpr7k,1580911230.0,You're a hundred percent right. This language would never have been used before Bernie. This movement is waking up a sleeping giant; the American middle-class.
SandersForPresident,fglsy6b,t3_ez37x0,1580910170.0,"Damn Bernie knows just what we're feeling. He is so connected to his base it is unreal. I have never felt more ""on the same level"" with a politician in my life. Let's go Bernie! We're gonna fix this country, and give it back to the people! Not the corporations!"

BlackPeopleTwitter,fg6etsf,t1_fg5tugb,1580565895.0,"This is not even the worst of the comments. There were ""doctors"" defending the current state of our medical industry by saying; ""sorry that sometimes your surgery can go later than expected..."" like dude are you really a doctor because you seem pretty dim-witted to me. Guy ignores the fact that our services and meds are price gouged +125 percent. God it makes me sick to even have to defend Bernie anymore. Conservatives have reached epic levels of stupidity in the last few months. And I remember GWBush."

I realize it's not every employer but you have to hop around a bit to finally find one that isn't trying to suck every last dime from their employees.

This is a campaign only relying on people. Working people. Not corporations, or conglomerates who suck up the earth's natural resources and then pay 0 in taxes. This is funded by the people that pay 20-30 percent of their measly paychecks every year to fix roads and build schools. This is for the guy who pees in a bottle during his 60 hour workweek in an Amazon wharehouse, who was told he could not unionize. This campaign is by and for the people!!

Intelligence,feyka5u,t1_few53i4,1579446644.0,"Russia is using small low powered, but advantageously placed devices that will block out GPS from the device to the horizon.. Troops on the Ukrainian Front have been reporting their GPS shows them as in Moscow. This has been reported numerous times. I dont think people understand the ramifications of this kind of disruption.


Edit: [This is just one small example](https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/report-russian-gps-spoofing-threatens-safety-of-navigation) of what is going on all over Europe. They even use it as part of Putins entourage now so GPS is spoofed in the vicinity of Putin.

Edit: I feel like I need to say gps signals are extremely low powered and easily spoofed by a device connected to a motorcycle battery."
