ems,ffoar1o,t1_ffo01xu,1580075798.0,"Hey man, so long as you didn’t stop giving a fuck about medicine, I don’t blame you. I just hate the guys that get their P card so they can drag hoses. That’s not how EMS should be run, and IMO EMS should be 3rd service and fire should be BLS. This would keep people that don’t care about medicine out of EMS. 

I don’t care any more though, I’m gonna try for PA or gtfo of Medicine."

Had some frumpy husband point his finger at me, because he thought I was a student or some shit when the ems line wasn’t drawing back for my lab collection. “I don’t want you practicing on my wife”, meanwhile I’m like one of the go to people for hard sticks lmao. 

It was before I had my customer service face on, and I said, “what are you talking about?” Needless to say, they were gone like 2 hours later. The white knight’s wife had gas or some bullshit, and people wonder why we don’t baby them. Sorry your mothers raised you to be soft I guess"

powerlifting,ffd9i1r,t1_ffd8a1g,1579816062.0,"Yeah I’m really trying to stay positive. The odds are extremely in my favor, far better than any bet I’ve ever made, yet I’m still stressed as fuck about it. 

And yeah, I guess I don’t “feel” small, so I feel like I should be stronger, but I don’t think I’m exactly weak either. I think at 220 I’d be much better off! 

I did hit 405 in wraps, so I’ve at least got that, but again, I never felt like I could get any stronger at my current weight. I guess my fear was that I’d gain weight but not much strength to go with it"
powerlifting,ffd7lbf,t1_ffb8oi2,1579814972.0,"I’m 5’10” 200 lbs, I can pause 225 for 7, so decent? My work’s been stressful as fuck. I’ve had anxiety all day, because I got pricked (albeit, barely) by a needle from a pt that was hep c+, and have to undergo bloodwork the rest of the year to ensure the cunt didn’t pass it along to me. 


Aside from that though, yeah I’ve noticed even though I’m not super tall, I feel strongest when I’m ~205 as that’s the heaviest I’ve been"

powerlifting,ffb0ocu,t3_esd7t6,1579748895.0,"So, I watched Alan Thrall’s video on “bulking”, and I think it highlights where I’ve been going wrong. I got sick, lost a little weight, haven’t been eating as much, but I can still pause bench my body weight x at least 10, bench 225x9 etc. my squat’s ok, but not as good as it once was when I was a tad heavier. 

I guess my question is, how the fuck are the 198’ers benching 500+ like John Haack? Why do I have to be 200+ just to hit 225x10+ consistently?

How much stronger have you guys gotten by putting on 10-20lbs? How long do you recommend spanning this weight gain out? The Kinesiology degree helped with some of the nutritional side of things, but I’m still struggling with applying it to my life, as I go for my second bacc, and work 12 hour shifts. I’m all ears for your personal success stories"

science,ff6fxc4,t1_fevy7ty,1579626335.0,"I mean, as someone who works in health care, I’d bet my left testicle that if someone’s calling 911 for a stubbed toe, they’ve got Medicaid. When we get cold symptoms in the ER, Medicaid. When the ankle pain “patient”, calling at 2am has section 8 housing nicer than anything I can afford, 4 kids from 4 different men, and no job, Medicaid. Yeah, that tends to put a real sour taste in your mouth. 

And I’m not even trying to judge these people, because I’m there to help, but you notice these things. When you see it over and over, and over, yeah, it sounds like the working class are getting fucking scammed. And we are. Medicaid for ALL, or Medicaid for only the most sick and crippled. All these fat people with htn and type II diabetes on Medicaid that decide the only, “job” they needed was welfare sponge, are exactly what the other dude called them. Free loaders."

Sorry the hospital sat on their fucking ass. I’d have gone to my charge on behalf of EMS if I heard an EMT/Medic got stuck."
ems,ff58ixi,t1_ff50d6w,1579583400.0,"Exactly! Being an ER tech’s made me pretty good at em too, since I start like 20 a day if I’m in triage. The worrier in me is scared, but rationally, it’s like a 1% chance and that’s IF she’s even nasty with the Hep.
