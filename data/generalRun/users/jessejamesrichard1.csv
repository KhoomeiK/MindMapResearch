Economics,ffoj8zg,t1_ffofv2x,1580078249.0,It’d be hard to imagine many drug co.s willing to walk away from the world largest market.
Economics,ff9g8jz,t1_ff9fpxx,1579712356.0,And you.
Economics,ff9f9e8,t1_ff9cuq4,1579711757.0,"Absolutely nothing. In a normal, healthy economy nothing is a better motivator. That's not what you posited initially. You posited that there as no better motivator for someone to do something for you. I said death, which is true 9 times in 10. In a normal, healthy economy profit is the key motivation, not death. A profit motivation cannot be achieved without regulation, by extension regulating profit, which was almost my verbatim my response. All roads lead to Rome on this entire thread.

Regulation is good. Profit is good. Neither can exist normally and healthily without the other. Regulated profit.

Here are some of the core principles espoused by Adam Smith regarding this:

I'm guessing you think I'm saying the government should come in and say ""you can only make this much money"" as broadly applicable laws. Though there are laws that act this way, I'm saying that profit is already regulated. We have agreed as a society that's the way it needs to be."
Economics,ff9bmpz,t1_ff975g9,1579709265.0,"Define normal. I think you mean healthy. ""In a healthy, functional society, what works better than profit to motivate others."" Normal to the French is not normal to Americans. So you mean healthy, right?"
Economics,ff96hs7,t1_ff94fn2,1579705989.0,"Death. For instance: I could give you a billion dollars but you’ll die at the end of the day. Would you take it? Inversely, patriotism. I will pay you poorly and you might die, but is it worth your country to do so? Punishment. Reciprocal altruism. Ego. Natural law. etc.  

You’ll note I’m listing a lot of complex interactions of motivations within an individual that exist in various magnitudes. 

Every person has many, many motivations to do many, many things. I have not discounted financial prosperity entirely. Go back to my OP and you’ll see that. I’ve accounted for the broader scope of motivations. If profit motivation was sole we wouldn’t need any economic theory. We’d all be automatons. So it’s short-sighted to say profit motivation when regulated is disastrous always, as you’ve suggested. In many cases it’s not. If you’re hinging your theory of disaster economy on dollars only, you’re off base. IMHO."
Economics,ff937n6,t1_ff90adv,1579703739.0,"The point does not stand. You’ve contradicted yourself in two responses. 

The point that does stand is that financial profit is not the “sole” motivator in many, many instances. That’s the flaw in logic. A perfectly free market exists nearly nowhere outside a black market. Free markets are always adjusted in an economy of a highly developed nation to account for externalities. The market demands it. In the case of healthcare, social services like police, healthcare, fire, etc. you’re accounting for elasticity of the demand. In other areas, say the military, the survival of the market itself. You can have matching markets in “free economy” that has zero financial profit motive. Or a gift economy for that matter. Within a non-developed nation you might have zero financial motive. The idea that a market collapses with price adjustment within an economy can be disproven thousands of times over by the mere existence of any social program within a nation. Monopolies and monopsonies are other examples of things that require adjustments. Existence of places like DPRK are examples. Bailouts are. Consumer safety is. Laws. Natural Law itself. The list goes on in perpetuity. Adam Smith himself acknowledged this. 

Free markets are merely more or less free, not perfectly free. So my point stands: remove financial profit motivation entirely and you’re left with mortal motivation *ahem healthcare*. Take away a single dollar and a consumer might still be motivated to exist within a nation. We’ve all agreed on that. The thing we may or may not agree on is how much a market is adjusted. A regulated free economy exists wherever you’re reading this. We’ve all agreed to it. We hammer down on what constitutes proper regulations of the overall health of a society *ahem healthcare again*"

Economics,fe45g5x,t1_fe3wcka,1578855986.0,"Absolutely; that's the point of society. Exactly what I am saying. We owe society something and in turn society owes us something. There's absolutely no disputing that fact. So since we can agree on that, the question isn't if society owes us something or if we feel entitled to it, but to what degree that debt is to be paid in regard to the overall health of a society/economy. Whereas you might think to pay out welfare for the disenfranchised is giving to the takers (unacceptable), you might also think giving welfare to the farmers is giving to the givers (acceptable), wherein practice they're both the same thing. They are a transfer of wealth from one body to another, each party of which seems to feel they're entitled to it. Living wage, healthcare, education, bailouts, foreign and domestic defence/safety, etc. etc. All examples of things we individually might feel entitled to. Entitlement is universal among people. You and me alike. You and I might just disagree on what constitutes a ""good one."""

Economics,fdwnz27,t1_fdwip00,1578760686.0,"I would agree there are wide socioeconomic factors in play. Simply boiling it down to “socialism” does no on - NO ONE - any justice. IMHO a huge misstep by Democrats (in America, of course) to use this term in their messaging. Socialism is a snake bit word with vapid meaning in America. A rallying cry for the left and a scare word for the right.  In the rest of the developed world, these rather unambiguous concepts, like minimum wage and socialized programs (healthcare) seem like settled issues.  And they’re successful. 

From an economics standpoint the thing I look at as a Millennial is wage inequality, consumer debt, and living wage in comparison to inflation. These are widely (de)stabilizing indicators. So you can measure outcomes economically by things like upward social mobility and lbs-for-lbs intellectual property output, and socially by happiness index and life expectancy. The winners in these categories tend to exist in Scandinavia, not America as regularly assumed. Something like GDP PP is good (kinda). Stock market, job growth, and unemployment are incomplete numbers at best. They’d go to America. In the end, the health of a society goes beyond a bank account balance. I think that’s what the left in America is decrying. 

I’m not American, but I’ve been a resident a number of times. The lack of insight of things like market inelasticity (healthcare) and wage inequality (living wages) is cringeworthy to me. Especially since the data seems to be in in other markets. I’d be curious if the economic policies of say Denmark were applied to America what the GDP PP would look like. America is soOo much different than the rest of the developed world, it’s hard to say.

Both the left and right seem willfully ignorant and cherry pick “their” stats. IMHO."
Economics,fdwhcmg,t1_fdvvz4r,1578758701.0,"I’m confused about this “socialism” quip. It sounds - not saying it is - a partisan obfuscation of the actual economic policies that leftists are advocating for, which is far closer to social democracy than communism. Are you suggesting people who are pushing for a living wage are suddenly going to regret that in 10 years? Or are you suggesting people who want a living wage want vast distribution of wealth beyond what you see in other developed nations? Because neither sound a correct characterization."
