mildlyinteresting,fglwizf,t1_fgk20e8,1580912650.0,"It looks like there is one that is a NRHP and several that are not. Also, there are mounds all over the place around here. Probably going to take this off my list of things to do.
I have a small assortment of Civil War items, stuff that is readily available online (buyer beware of course). There are a few museums around town that display ""witness"" objects. Anyway, thanks for sharing your insights and experience."
mildlyinteresting,fgk0hxv,t1_fgjpzoc,1580854994.0,"So, for example, the general area around a former Civil War camp would be off-limits? The particular place I'm thinking of: The marker is in the wrong place and the former site is abandoned to the woods and includes a stretch of river. 

I'm fine with turning stuff over"

worldnews,fghcpy8,t1_fgh8g8m,1580781912.0,"Individuals (Republicans) conspired with the President not to testify. The House Republicans felt it necessary to out the whistleblower and question others who were not fact witnesses or involved directly in the Presidents illicit activity in order to advance a conspiracy theory. You can call Micky Mouse if you want to, but don't cry foul when he doesn't show up with Goofy and whoever else to talk about how the moon is made out of green cheese. 
It's surprising that some people are still bamboozled by this nonsense."

Most of the playlist is a mixture of hits from both charts. They periodically do a rundown of British top 35 from a particular week in history. I listen at work usually to pass the time. Once in a while I listen to BBC World news whenever I happen to be working really late at night (GMT)"

worldnews,fg6et4x,t1_fg6cyao,1580565878.0,"This is a perfect set up for Trump. It's not just the healthcare industry that will blanch at the notion of universal healthcare. I think it's a great idea and I'm all for 100%, but many people out there aren't ready to get on board with that.

Meanwhile, people steadfastly loyal to Bernie will become disaffected and not vote if he doesn't receive the nomination. I mean, even at this point if the DNC were to \*steal the nomination away from Bernie, do we really need another 4 years of the orange orangutang and his flying monkies?"

My dad was playing some stupid thing on the piano and Randy Rhodes actually came over and thoughtfully interacted with my dad over his stupid music.
