todayilearned,fek4hu0,t1_fejwscb,1579192427.0,"$690,000 changes the context, but not by a whole lot. Charleston has 100,000 people and an international airport that’s not really a village but ok.

I think in your world, the words “average” and “city” and have lost their meaning. If it’s not a $1,000,000 (usd or aus) home in a place with over a million people you’re saying it’s below average and small. Considering you own either over $1,000,000 in real estate assets (or over $2,000,000 if you have both houses, in separate parts of the world) your detachment from what is average doesn’t surprise me."
todayilearned,fejrjs6,t1_fej06c3,1579184066.0,"I feel like for conversation sake we’re getting caught up in semantics and dictionaries. Call it whatever you want, it’s a big city known as a big city. It’s also, being a city on the west coast of the USA, known for a geographic area for a higher cost of living. I’m not an expert on city demographics and housing prices across the globe. I can tell you that every time I see people claim you need $1,000,000 for an “average house” I think those people need to readjust both their definition of average and also how it relates to where is a live able area.

To me, that’s a massive, very nice home. Not quite a mansion but a step or two below it.

So I guess my point, again, is that these houses are way above average homes (except arguably the one in Tampa is maybe only just better than average) and are relatively close to significant cities. They’re not cherry picked in the boonies. So it becomes a correlation line of “how close to a city” “what city” and the definition of average.

You can buy a nice house outside of a nice place (city) to live for well under (like half or even less than half of) a million dollars. Or you can buy closer to *in* the city, and spend more or get something smaller. Or you can choose to live near a specifically expensive place to live (Sydney, West Coast USA, NYC) and pay more. 

But you don’t have to spend $1,000,000 to get an “average home.” That’s the exception rather than the norm."
todayilearned,feiz4di,t1_feiyde5,1579151324.0,"I guess my point was more along the lines that in most places you’re not going to have to spend $1m on an “average” house. Globally recognized mega cities? Yeah sure. But there are many many nice places, still cities, still tourist destinations, etc, where $1m can get you a big house on water in a very nice neighborhood."

pcgaming,fe9ooqh,t1_fe6rugt,1578940064.0,Eh. I think it depends on what kind of gameplay leaps are available. I feel like a city such as Miami has more... ridiculousness to it. Especially with the beach etc. and the last rumors I read was that GTA6 was in Miami because you were starting a drug smuggling business into South America. Sounds unreal and if that’s true would be really amazing. I personally hope they continue the pseudo realism from RDR2 as well. It’s almost a role playing aspect.
CompetitiveForHonor,fe9jjbk,t3_enfewy,1578938218.0,You’ll see me on there. I have played in a few tournaments now but after all of them I’ve always been so disappointed in my performance. I stomp the shit out of people in MM but playing competitively is entirely different for a lot of reasons. It’s not just a matter of being mechanically good at video games you have to play a role and you have to have this overall team strategy and fit your role into that team which is great I just suck at it right now. In fact I think I’m probably on par mechanically or better with anyone on my team but hold them back on a strat level and it’s frustrating. That and probably I don’t even know what role I really want to play or what would mesh with me the best.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fe6lwrp,t1_fdukpk7,1578895336.0,"Those just aren’t mainstream games. Hellblade, kinda. For Honor, ehhhhhh yes mainstream but it’s a tough argument to class it as a vikings game. It’s a medieval fighting game that has Vikings in it. Really the only recent AAA game that’s clearly vikings and Norse mythology based is God of War.

pcgaming,fdlmm53,t1_fdll01p,1578527453.0,Oh ok I somehow missed that. DDR4 only is definitely not a great reason for the majority of people to build a new gaming rig. I was at work. I was reading it as an arguments of standards and I would say yeah DDR4 is definitely the standard now.

pcgaming,fdk371j,t1_fdjztsx,1578494947.0,"They really do be like that. I know what you mean, but at the same time it’s the semantics of the phrasing. “High end.” I would consider the xx70 series high end. They’re capable of ultra settings at higher resolutions and frame rates. It’s just important to note that “high end” is a SPECTRUM and not a defining line. Cards like this are the entry barrier to that spectrum and if you don’t at least have that it’s definitely not high end (in general terms, for gaming).

I would argue that once you get above these levels and the next step or so you’re in the “top of the line/flagship/enthusiast” world. It’s like saying a corvette is a super car. Well, no. It’s a sports car. It’s really nice and can do a lot, but it is not a P1."
pcgaming,fdk2kay,t1_fdjj007,1578494498.0,"Eh. DDR4 is around 7 years old. If you’re in the market for a new build you’re going to wind up with DDR4. DDR3 is still perfectly capable, but that’s also because next gen consoles have not dropped yet. Hardware demands will jump forward a bit with that. This year and next year will be outstanding times to build a lasting machine IMO."
pcgaming,fdk2eja,t1_fdjodf4,1578494384.0,Define sick build and cheap and nice frames? It’s all variables. You’re not doing ultra 4k 60fps for $900 but you can build a nice machine for 1080p at that cost. See what I mean?

Forex,fditrwq,t1_fdhyxuf,1578450861.0,"It depends on the instrument. I recommend getting the app “Stinu.”

I will use EURUSD as an example.

$1,000 account balance, 2% risk, 20 pip stop loss, you could use 0.1 lots. If your stop loss is 30 pips, you could use .067 lots (round to .07 or .06).

If the pair was AUDNZD you could use .152 lots, or round to .15 lots."
pcgaming,fdhxq44,t1_fdhljch,1578432064.0,I’m pretty sure RDR2 worked out of the box but I didn’t play on launch so I could be wrong.
Forex,fdhxnfi,t1_fdhup4j,1578432026.0,"Yes, but not necessarily. It all depends on your entry vs stop loss and target.

So say your long (buy) entry is 1.0000. Say your stop loss is 0.9980 and your target is 1.0020. This means you are risking 1 to 1. If your target is 1.0040 you are now risking 1 to make 2. Mathematically, you can now lose more often than you win and remain profitable. For a $1,000 account at 2% risk, you would have to calculate (each instrument is different) how many lots you could buy so that 20 pips is $20 (2%). So you’d either make $40 or lose $20.

Keep in mind that these target prices and stop prices and entry prices are all based on technical and fundamental levels."

Forex,fdhvkmc,t1_fdgtu52,1578430932.0,"Sort of. Technical analysis is extremely useful and good for timing, but if you were buying and holding for long periods you’re saying that you’re predicting the future interest rates, wars, recessions, booms, for potential weeks months years.

The issue with this style of trading is that will eventually go against you very quickly and very hard, and that will wipe out all of the quick flips you made attempting to hold until you’re in profit. Not to mention it’s slow."
Forex,fdht4ng,t3_el7l3j,1578429676.0,"I’ve read some of your comments and see you are a total beginner. My recommendation, and I’m serious, is to take a dollar amount that is *slightly* more than you’d be ok setting on fire, and going live with it AFTER you learn some basics.

Demo trading does not prepare you for losing money. Demo trading does not prepare you for gaining money. Demo trading does not affect you psychologically. Unless you are devoid of feelings completely (you’re not) you will have emotion in trading until you’ve done it ten thousand times.

Learn basics at babypips. Concentrate on risk management. My personal trading system I risk 2% max (overall account size) and don’t take a trade unless the minimum expected outcome is 4%. Take note of the phrasing there (hint: the emphasis is not on the word minimum or max).

When you trade you should have: a risk to reward (target and stop loss) and should know, based on your system, what percent risk you should be inputting into that trade setup. So an entry price, a stop loss price, and an exit price. If you don’t have those you are gambling (generally speaking) IMO."
