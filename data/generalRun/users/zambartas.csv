Now if the head of the CIA, Facebook or Amazon were complaining, then you might have a valid point."

IAmA,ff580qq,t3_erek2q,1579582942.0,"I'm curious if anyone else has had a similar experience as mine:

My son had a pretty strong reaction to peanut butter when he was months old.  Face swelled up, no EpiPen was given but we did take him to the hospital to be safe.  They gave him something along the Benadryl line, he fell asleep and soon recovered and we went home.

Not too long after we had him skin tested which resulted in a variety of items like eggs and various nuts testing positive.  They wanted to do food challenges, however our insurance wouldn't cover it so we never had him tested.  

Afterwards he had a mild reaction to mustard powder in a home cooked meal, some swelling and hives.  

The mustard allergy completely went away months after it's first appearance.  Mustard is one of those things that isn't labeled in America so it was hard to track down, and ultimately when it came down to it - we didn't want to completely sterilize his environment, so he more likely than not was exposed to mustard powder accidentally but not intentionally.

At some point we figured that he must have gotten over the allergy because there was no way all of the foods he was eating were mustard free (although we couldn't be 10p percent sure).  Sure enough he dipped a French fry in the honey mustard at the restaurant table before we even noticed it was there, and no reaction at all.

My question: is this normal to have an allergy appear and disappear in a matter of months and does this have any bearing on the other allergies?  Other things like eggs and almonds that had been positive on the skin tests never showed any true reactions from ingestion, so the only allergies I can verify are peanuts and mustard and mustard has been kicked."

And then when you sell it to someone else, it's taxed again.  This country needs some serious tax reform and not the kind the current president is in favor of."
