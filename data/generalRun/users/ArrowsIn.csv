leagueoflegends,ff2icv3,t1_ff2hmzp,1579507432.0,"Or maybe what you said was just stupid, and that's why it got downvoted. Food for thought."
facepalm,fdc3qch,t1_fda63pr,1578266513.0,That's not how that works. You're not too bright.
leagueoflegends,fd9vbaq,t1_fd9ur3o,1578238445.0,"nope. it just was an expected stomp because of the matchups, which is unlike what happened today. nobody is saying licorice is better than kiin. are people trying to argue that viktor and gp aren't lane bullies?"
leagueoflegends,fd9r813,t1_fd99u83,1578237025.0,not rly. kiin vs licorice was given viktor twice and gp vs ornn. all matches he's supposed to win hard.
facepalm,fd9a4uu,t1_fd803os,1578230630.0,That's the dumbest thing I've read in a while.
facepalm,fd5euaq,t1_fd4rx9o,1578176913.0,There are poor people in first world countries.
leagueoflegends,fd5co74,t1_fd2nq28,1578176310.0,what does that have to do with MSI? try to follow along
leagueoflegends,fd202s3,t1_fd1p62g,1578139538.0,no it wouldn't. in fact it would make it even harder. weird comment
leagueoflegends,fd1podc,t1_fd1i5fi,1578134853.0,"realise that if TL MSI finals was a fluke, then G2 winning MSI was also a fluke. u guys don't deal with logic very well"
RocketLeagueEsports,fcz6qnq,t1_fcx8roy,1578094794.0,"We could definitely talk about LoL and show you why you're wrong there, but I figured you wanted to stay consistent.

> Why are you comparing two completely different games with completely different circumstances?"
RocketLeagueEsports,fcx3aqn,t1_fcx2yfx,1578049354.0,"> History is literally redundant, because top EU players leaving has never happened before, so you can't remotely look at history to claim you know what is going to happen.

Sure it has. Turbo is our example. EU did fine after he left. What's your evidence for EU doing poorly if EU players leave? It hasn't happened."
RocketLeagueEsports,fcx2lpv,t1_fcx2e3m,1578048461.0,"History has shown for that not to be the case, and that includes other games as well. Just look at league of legends where EU loses top talent every year to NA and still competes at top level. There's plenty of talent to replace people like Scrub and Turbo."
RocketLeagueEsports,fcwyh14,t1_fcvwj2o,1578043068.0,One region hasn't dominated at all. The finals was literally game 7 overtime. You can't get any closer.
leagueoflegends,fcwx803,t1_fcwv1kb,1578041488.0,"Then why did they almost 2-0 SSG if they weren't good vs world class teams?

Reddit ignorance is bliss

Just stop, you are giving the whole reddit a bad reputation because of that ignorance."
leagueoflegends,fctw96y,t1_fctrjhk,1577962756.0,Nah TSM were better than H2K S6.
RocketLeagueEsports,fcrvfiu,t1_fcrv1st,1577907146.0,Using that logic would mean NRG>RV>DIG. Meaning NRG would win.
RocketLeagueEsports,fcruwgx,t1_fcr53bm,1577906939.0,Lol no
europe,fcp60bg,t1_fcp39ho,1577851603.0,Fighting ignorance with ignorance isn't really the best solution. What the guy you replied to said was dumb... but so was what you said.
POLITIC,fbysy45,t1_fbufqkm,1577225486.0,what's with your obsession with america? what does it stem from?
