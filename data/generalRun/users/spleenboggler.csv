In the United States, however, cities are quite often economic units, created because of a need for some product that the city can fulfill. People are drawn to the city for these economic reasons, and when that need is exhausted, the people's grandchildren move on. 

The best examples of this are the towns that popped up around a natural resource, like gold, silver or oil, that subsequently disappear when that resource is played out. Many so-called Rust Belt cities were centers of heavy manufacturing for a number of years, and when economic conditions made overseas manufacturing less expensive, the jobs left and people dispersed. 

Other factors include greater transportation mobility, and how that interacted with racial attitudes and other factors to produce regions with both thriving suburbs and desperate ghettos. 

Thriving cities are those that have successfully responded to these challenges."
