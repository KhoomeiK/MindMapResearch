Female 2: I hate you all."
aww,ffq9tng,t1_ffq9phy,1580127468.0,"Well he was the most maternal dog I ever saw. He also tried to steal kittens and once a lizard at the vets. The only time he ever got upset at the vets was when he thought they were hurting a puppy (they were taking out a canula and she yelped, he bumped the vet nurse out of the way and ‘rescued’ the puppy)."
aww,ffq9ext,t1_ffq5k47,1580126990.0,"We had a giant breed male who was OBSESSED with puppies. He would leave them dripping. He was always trying to get them out of whatever crate or box they came in (rescue) to play with him, or just so he could stare at them, while my other female dogs would be either chasing them back into the box or sitting out of reach on the back of an armchair studiously ignoring them, respectively."
AmItheAsshole,ffotefo,t1_ffos72h,1580081537.0,"I have 2 dogs, 1 brain. The older female dog is like an assistance dog for the younger male. He won’t even eat something new until he sees her eat it first. He won’t pee somewhere until she has. He melts down if she goes out without him. His adoption ad said ‘needs a strong bitch for guidance’ and they did not lie."

The dogs don’t ‘go everywhere’ with him, they hardly go anywhere. He only gets photographed walking them around the massive grounds of the Áras (his house). They host a lot of events there. Bród and Síoda are thrilled all these people keep coming to visit them, I assume.

His dong on the other hand? I assume that goes with him."

At a low moment in my life, an abuser love bombed me and made me feel better. Then gradually dismantled my self worth until I felt I deserved the treatment I got. I don’t feel comments like this tell the majority of abuse victims’s stories. She isn’t broken beyond repair, such just needs to break an unhealthy cycle."

relationship_advice,ffmgn19,t1_fflwrfp,1580054386.0,"She’s an addict basically. I’ve been there. You are so hooked on your abuser’s approval, it genuinely is like a drug. You have given so much of your mental energy to them for so long, it’s hard to know how not to focus on their needs. 

She needs to agree to cut him out completely or your relationship will not work."

AmItheAsshole,ffflqol,t1_ffflcl4,1579886689.0,And when it was nearly here it got stuck in a Spanish port for a storm? It was hilarious.
AmItheAsshole,fffeo5h,t1_fffed8f,1579882312.0,"Yeah, I did it from the U.K., without my mother being on top of shit we never would have managed. At one point right before our meeting with the civil registrar, the DVLA lost my husband’s drivers licence and passport and I was planning how to sneak him over the border in Armagh somewhere so we wouldn’t have to cancel the whole thing!"
bridezillas,fffbfv1,t1_fffb6k0,1579880268.0,"I don’t think that’s the case in Ireland, but yeah we briefly looked at getting married in France, near where my husband is from. Even as a French citizen, he had to be in the department for 30 days prior to the wedding, and I would have to do 90!"
bridezillas,fff9siq,t1_ffey947,1579879211.0,"Also, as I commented on the post, there’s actually a lot involved in getting legally married in Ireland. The venue has to be licensed, the celebrant has to be licensed and you need a marriage license. If it’s not going to be the legal wedding, just get married in the states and do a photo shoot in Ireland on your honeymoon there."
AmItheAsshole,fff9jp4,t1_fff67ih,1579879049.0,Lots of places stay closed til the 2nd of Jan!
AmItheAsshole,fff99dn,t1_ffebchq,1579878863.0,If you see good December wedding pictures from Ireland they were probably take on an Atlantic cliff so the Arctic winds could clear away some of the cloud cover. Otherwise grey all the way!
AmItheAsshole,fff8plu,t1_ffevezk,1579878497.0,"Seriously, I am Irish, I have been to 2 lovely Christmas weddings (as in Irish people- we could all go home after!), my sister may yet tell me she is getting married this Christmas and I will think it’s great, but this is a TERRIBLE idea! 

The flights will be insane, the accommodation will be insane, and as a trip it will suck, unless you have money to 5star everything (which you don’t). 

Everything will be closed, you wouldn’t get to see any tourist attractions. Lots of places will close Christmas Eve to Jan 2nd.

It’ll be dark about 18 hours a day (we’re quite far north), the sun may never get through the clouds, and likely wet. I have had one white Christmas in my 30+ years. 

Travel within the country will be a nightmare. That white Christmas? We ran out of road salt. We all sat at home watching daily news updates on where the ship with the salt was. But even without that, buses and trains will have reduced service, taxis will be at premium rates, car rental prices will be jacked up (and you will have to drive in the wet, dark, wrong side of the road for you). 

Also, I question how much research your sister has put into this -it’s not that easy to get married in Ireland. This isn’t Vegas. 

She’s not getting married in a church on Christmas Eve. Now she needs a non-religious celebrant. Getting ordained on the internet is not a thing here. You have to be on a government list. They book up well over a year out (I really struggled to find a humanist with a year’s notice and that wasn’t for CHRISTMAS EVE!). Your sister will need to come over around 3 months in advance to meet the civil registrar to get a marriage license. Then the venue has to be licensed for weddings- some hotels are and some aren’t. It’s unlikely she’d get another licensed venue for Christmas Eve (then she’d have to arrange the staff, the catering, the bar and bar tenders herself.)
