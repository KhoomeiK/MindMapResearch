amiugly,ff4kolz,t3_eri4t1,1579565941.0,"Dude....yeah they're big, but honestly, you're pretty damn cute. Maybe add some of the old razzle dazzle (piercings) that way you can look at them and find something you like about them if piercings are your thing."
AmItheAsshole,ff4487n,t3_erfvwt,1579555181.0,"This annoys me on your behalf. NTA. You forgot it was even a thing, and I just feel it's kind of crappy that when you were at the hotel she was trying to gain something (the dress) during a time where she was supposed to be there for you. I wouldn't wear my sisters wedding dress (in this situation). I'd be scared that it'd bring up painful memories for her. She'll live."

I'm sorry this has been hard for you but proud of you for trying to provide self care and talking to someone about it. If you'd like, feel free to message anytime."
