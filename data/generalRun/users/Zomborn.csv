facepalm,ffc6cw1,t1_ffc69wb,1579792576.0,Yeah it's my theory as to why it's like that. It's great early game whereas SA is great midgame. Depends what plague you're doing too.
facepalm,ffc6404,t1_ffc5dw6,1579792410.0,"Yeah, I don't like India so much because there's a higher chance to be discovered. Just like in China. Not sure if it's because of population density. I've found myself being better starting in SA because of the generally harder plague discovery."

nextfuckinglevel,ffc5kg4,t1_ffbdivf,1579792043.0,"I'd disagree. First there's no such thing as a god given talent. Someone can be better at some things because of their genetics. We know that the brain of creative people are chemically different from the rest. This means that these people are better at artistic jobs. That doesn't mean you can't chemically change your brain and with enough hard work you can get to the same level. It may be much harder, especially at first, but there's nothing stopping you. The problem is people give up or don't try hard enough."
facepalm,ffc2uvq,t1_ffc0z1y,1579790165.0,"Nah that's a terrible place to start. And a death sentence on mega brutal. Start in Saudi Arabia and upgrade plane and boat transmission, cold and medicine resistance help too."

PewdiepieSubmissions,ffbi5mi,t1_ffay1ho,1579766399.0,"China and India are not good for mega brutal. Saudi Arabia is superior for its insane ammount of airplane routes. Also in MB you need to start increasing severity and lethality before you've infected everyone, otherwise I don't think it's even doable."
PewdiepieSubmissions,ffbi21c,t1_ffb8hp6,1579766264.0,Upgrade plague cold resistance to level 2.its worked for me.
PewdiepieSubmissions,ffbhzhu,t1_ffaugoh,1579766170.0,"China for fast early game or Saudi Arabia for insane midgame. Saudi Arabia has the most plane routes so if you max plane transmission and get infectivity high you're golden. Make sure you don't increase lethality or severity until you've got a good spread going on. Ideally 80% of the countries and over half the population. By now your plague has likely been detected unless you're in easy difficulty. If it has been detected there's a few things you can do.

First evolve symptoms like insomnia which makes it harder to cure. If you've got about 75% of the population and the cure is closer to finishing than not, upgrade symptoms like coma or paralysis which increase lethality and severity but make it harder to cure.

Second thing to know is that severity makes the plague much harder to cure, but also increases the funding for it. Basically if you increase severity early on, you're likely to lose, as not only will it be detected faster, the research will begin earlier and it will be much faster. On the other hand if you have managed to significantly impact the global population with either death or plague, increase the lethality as the funding won't be able to keep up.

Third tip would be to upgrade as much infectivity as you can early on, not in symptoms but in transmission. Get birds, mosquitoes, and rats if you're targeting cities or livestock for rural areas.

Finally, make sure you use your plague's abilities. Plague's like the prion have really nice and important features that make winning a game is harder if you don't use them."
PewdiepieSubmissions,ffbhgbh,t3_esjx9r,1579765470.0,Nah just evolve transmission early on and you're good. Morocco on the other hand...

Unexpected,fe649bz,t1_fe0e5br,1578881446.0,"Don't. They're playing. Look for the play signs like bowing their heads and not biting each other hard. If you separate them while playing that will not only strain their relationship but send mixed messages to their little heads. It's better to intervene only when they start fighting for real. You can tell by the obvious signs such as intense and angry barking, snarling and showing their teeth, and biting each other hard. If one of them whimpers while they're playing, it's generally a sign that one got a bit too rough, they understand the whimper as a plea to stop so as an owner just let them solve it themselves, they will almost certainly just step away and when both have calmed down they start again.
