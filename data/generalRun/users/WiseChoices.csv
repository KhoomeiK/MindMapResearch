Christianity,ffckydo,t3_esvfrz,1579801667.0,"You do know that there's a war going on, right?  There's less and less neutral ground.  Ephesians 6 is in the Bible for a reason. 

And all human beings have a wonderful connection to God, a longing for who they can be.  When rebellion crosses that it can become so difficult.

Sometimes the tractor beam of faith is incredibly painful at times.

They see God as the problem and are struggling against their only hope.  It isn't a happy state of mind."

I look forward to meeting them in Heaven.  I hope that they hold seminars and we get to hear their stories from them.

Speech came with creation, and is a basic part of being created in the image of God.  

Part of why the Enemy LOVES the whole evolution lie is that it reduces humanity to the level of animals.  He doesn't want human beings to know that we are supernatural eternal beings. 

Adam and Eve are the building blocks of God's family.  And he is still creating new family members."

Time will be no more."

Search for your lifemate and find a treasure."
Christianity,ffcirjo,t1_ffch9wa,1579800345.0,"No, sorry, that isn't true.  The Bible doesn't teach anything like that. 

God knows people, and better than they know themselves.  God is a wonderful friend, but a terrible enemy.

God chooses those who choose him.

God's love continues over into sorrow at the loss of those who reject him, but he allows free will."

To me, I would treat it like a paramedic rescue.  They rush in and save your life, even if they have to cut off your clothes and hurt you. 

You are headed for an early disability if not a premature death. 

I would rework the kitchen, trash the junk and set it up for healthy eating or no eating. 

It might be worth it to go r/Zerocarb and r/Intermittentfasting 

I do both, and have been at my weight and on maintenance for a while.

I believe in it because I am a parent.  I knew immediately that if my parents knew that the Tribulation was coming, they would evacuate me.

In war, the parents always try to get their children out first. 

I think God will remove his family before Satan is unleashed in the Earth.  The presence of Believers prevents evil's control. 

We have to be gone."

Believers are the best thing that ever happens to God!

Jesus died as us for a completely selfish reason, the JOY we will all share in as his family.

Everything about obeying God is self-serving because it all comes out in our favor.
