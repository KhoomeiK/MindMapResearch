Flat_Earth_Is_Real,fepcuoh,t3_epbf9z,1579317391.0,It’s called satellite communication. It’s strange how all of the satellites in orbit only show the round earth. Guess millions of people are good at keeping secrets.

notaglobe,fepc5mg,t1_fcga46y,1579316923.0,Imagine believing a 2000 year old book with no evidence rather than thousands of years of scientific advancements. And what is with the “Jewish World Order”? All these claims are baseless and are not supported by science since you deny that too.

fatlogic,fdly1lz,t1_fdlexfc,1578535219.0,"Yeah, I agree with you. I always struggled getting to the weight I wanted. I ate healthy, and exercised frequently. My grandpa, uncle, and great-uncle all died of diabetes / obesity related issues although they attempted to lead healthy lifestyles. This scared me and was a good motivation to lose weight. I have a very slow metabolism so I have to work twice as hard to lose any weight. I wasn’t extremely overweight but I was bullied in high school for being “fat”. I was 4’10 for most of my high school career and only started exercising when I went through puberty. It’s a constant struggle and I hate how people discount my efforts because “I’m lazy”. Even though my bmi was 24, it was never enough."
