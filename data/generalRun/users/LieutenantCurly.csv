csMajors,ff79uvq,t1_fezo6oc,1579644128.0,"1. Just focus on your classes :) the tech tools you need for your internship will vary based on what project you are given so it's hard to tell you what specifically how to prep. However, you will most likely be using AWS, so it'd be good to look into that.

csMajors,feusark,t1_feu8r0v,1579389441.0,"A few reasons. Your return offer is for the same team and same location, I'm from the NY area but I worked in Seattle. I was really homesick during my internship (I had lots of fun, but at the end of the day I missed my family and friends) and so I was set on working in NYC (hence, Goldman Sachs). Amazon actually changed my offer to the Amazon NYC office and bumped up the pay which was really generous of them, but I also wanted to go to Goldman because I wanted to see CS and finance. I view internships as an opportunity for me to explore and get new perspectives on computer science, and so I didn't want to do all my internships at Amazon."

csMajors,fehu687,t1_feggomn,1579123935.0,"Yes, it's perfectly fine. When I was a freshman I put computer science and cognitive science as my majors on my resume even though I didn't officially declare them yet and I was never questioned about whether or not it was official."
csMajors,feg09yy,t1_fefmjbc,1579071480.0,"It is a really nice resume! But there are a few things (just minor suggestions as the resume itself is fairly good)...

* Removing ""Candidate"" when stating your degree. This can give a negative connotation and lead recruiters to think ""oh he/she is not official a CS Major"". Just state what degree you will be getting and if asked (which you most likely will not) you can say you haven't officially declared it yet
* Stating more courses in relevant courses. OP has only listed computer science courses (which is great!) but it's also good to list non-computer science courses that can be relevant as well such as math courses (e.g. calculus- most jobs will not require calculus but listing it can show you had the logical capability to complete calculus)
* Most of the bullet points in the experience section are nicely phrased! But for the Small Start Up bullet points, I feel they can be cut down to be shorter (especially the first one, it's a rather long bullet point)
* Bolding important words in descriptions you want recruiters to see (I do this at least, it's not a common practice but it works for me)

If OP is applying to many companies that are US based/applying to their US offices, this could be why it is difficult for them to get an internship. I've had Canadian friends have trouble getting US internships or even internships in Canada for US companies (as they have smaller offices thus less openings) despite them having very stacked resumes"
csMajors,fefzfyz,t1_fefyy17,1579070536.0,"Definitely still interview with them. Just also don't forget to look into local companies and apply for them too, as they tend to be less competitive than larger companies such as Amazon which has thousands of people applying from all over the country. I'd also look into any programs your school can provide which sets you up with internships!"
csMajors,fefyqax,t1_fefmtpb,1579069763.0,"It's not hopeless! Apply for internships (don't forget to look into local companies) but also reach out to professors to do research with them in case you cannot get an internship (doing research really helped me leverage myself to recruiters). If you got a good grade in a class relevant to your major, talk to the professor if they're doing research to see if you can help out. Good luck!!!"
csMajors,fefxwtj,t1_fefvvmo,1579068898.0,"It really depends on how you portray yourself. In many interviews I’ve talked about a really ugly Pokémon school website I made in 5th grade using just HTML. I think because I’m really enthusiastic about computer science most of my interviewers think it’s endearing but also I use it to show how I implement CS into my own life and how long I’ve been interested in it. 

I think if you just blatantly state you made something for Club Penguin, your interviewer may not take you seriously or view it as important. But if you enthusiastically share about what you made, the interviewer will feel it is important to you and hopefully view it as important themselves.

e.g. If the interviewer says ""Tell me about your projects""
Begin by talking about your most recent projects you made in college, but then you can add on at the end by saying ""Back in middle school I really enjoyed playing Club Penguin and so I created this thing [insert all the stuff you did]""
versus
""I [insert all the stuff you did] for this Club Penguin hack""

It's best to start off talking about Club Penguin and then ending with all the technical stuff you did (so that the interviewer remembers the technical stuff better because it was more recently stated)

When I phrase the 5th grade website I made in the first way, I have had interviewers say ""wow it's great you were interested in computer science so early!""

Good luck with your internship search! It can be really difficult, feel free to reach out if you have any questions."
college,feepdod,t3_eopuan,1579038421.0,"25k was enough for me to get through a year of college, however it depends on where you go for college. 

If you want to save money, I suggest living at home so you only have to pay tuition and not room and board. Also, I try to cut the costs of college by not buying any textbooks (so far it has worked out, though finding the PDF of a textbook was difficult at times). 

I pay for college by myself so I try to earn the money I need to pay for it. Though I end up earning enough to pay for the school year, I take out about $3000/yr in student loans just so I can have a little money saved up in my bank account in case I need it (hopefully I'll be able to pay it back a year after graduating)"
college,feen1wp,t3_eoqndl,1579037076.0,"It's definitely fine not to work while in college. Being a full time student is tough. I work about 10-20 hours a week while being a full time student and doing some other ECs and it's was definitely a juggle at first (was able to balance everything out though) and I can get why most people wouldn't want to do that.  

I think your motivation to do a summer internship is good, because that shows you do want to work it's just that being a full time student makes that difficult but you're open to doing it when you have time in your schedule."
college,feeltmt,t3_eomjwv,1579036362.0,"I keep myself fairly busy in college so I have no choice but to study on a regular basis (I work part-time, TA, research, play sports, and tutor). I split up my study time based on what the empty spots in my schedule are. I think for me being organized is what really helps (I like having planned out schedules). My studying is usually spaced out but during finals I don't do any ECs for the week so I can focus on studying and feeling prepared for my finals.

Edit: I study by making a lot of quizlets! I usually study these quizlets when I can to help with memorization (I like phrasing my quizlets flashcards so one side has a question and the other side is the answer- sometimes I see these questions on exams too)."
