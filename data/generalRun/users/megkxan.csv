AskReddit,fdiryfe,t1_fdhmx5c,1578449702.0,Why
AskReddit,fdir0ft,t3_eled64,1578449100.0,"That fact that people always loved getting awards on Reddit, until recently.  There were a lot of similar postings in a span of a few months that were basically  "" what are typical Reddit comments?""

In the past several days I have seen several people receive awards, and reacting to their award in this fashion: 
         
  ""Someone gave me an award for this? I don't want it.    

     Edit: quit spending your money one Reddit!

     Edit 2: wow, someone just gave me gold.. Fuck you.""

 I don't necessarily hate their reaction, though it seems unjustifiably harsh. Everyone has their right to their own opinion, it just seems (to me, at least) that the trendy thing to say is what gets upvotes and comments, while real opinions or facts gets shut down."

TILI,fc7169e,t1_fc46vyp,1577494779.0,You hate it because you're a thief?
holdmyfeedingtube,fc3xn69,t1_fc3xcjw,1577401266.0,That's a very good thought that made me laugh. Thank you
