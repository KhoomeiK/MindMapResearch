When the child is youngest, if the mother has more hours available or works during school hours, and generally am the mother is the primary caregiver. If more men where the primary caregiver it wouldn’t be skewed. And more women would also complain about how child support and the court system poorly affected their lives when they aren’t thinking about the children. 

Children need structure, especially during their primary school ages, and it’s been shown that weekdays with one parent, usually the mother but not always, and the other on weekends and more during breaks, is beneficial to the children. And when they are older, it becomes 50/50. That is for the child, you want sympathy for yourself?! For only recently winning custody? The sympathy should be for the children not that you are hurt and don’t understand how people have worked hard to figure out what is best for the children. 

Child support is not men’s rights or equality. Because the court tries to be impartial here and the parent just doesn’t want to pay money, to the child and often feels like it’s wasted on the other parent. 

A true argument for equality would be the obvious access to abortion for the young mother to prevent this tragedy, and knowledge about adoption, and keeping it is still her choice. 

Or sex education since Indiana is abstinence education is the standard. 

Im not implying, I’m flat out calling you out for thinking the solution to prevent this tragedy is feeling like child support is fair, when it is close to fair in the interest of the children and the parents just don’t want to pay a reasonable amount for the child. 

Comparing banning alcohol will prevent the tragedy and a court system in favor men and not the children will also prevent this tragedy is sad when there the family system is fairly decent and there are other issues that contributed to putting both of these young adults in this situation.
