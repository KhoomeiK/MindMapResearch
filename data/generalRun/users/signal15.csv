Don't get me wrong, I like yellow mustard as well.  But good dijon makes a solid/better replacement sometimes."

I read an article about this a few years ago, and someone from the US apparently ate some of this stuff, and ended up with long team health problems from it.  It's bad stuff.

Food safety is one of the most important things a government should and can enforce.  If your country isn't enforcing these things, you live in a 3rd world country.  China is shipping gutter oil out of the country, to North and South Korea, and other Asian nations.  They ship fentanyl and carfentanyl to the US and other countries.  Now, the US has authorized imports of Chinese chicken products into the US.  They have ships full of chickens that they butcher and package on the trek to the US, but no one really knows what they feed them or what kind of antibiotics they are pumping them full of.  I think Chinese beef was just approved as well.  I love Chinese food, but I don't trust anything that is actually from China.

On a side note, to illustrate how bad the problem is, India had basically no strong food laws until relatively recently.  One of the things that put in into motion was an ice cream company.  In most of the world, ice cream is sold by weight, not volume (like in the US).  In the US, manufacturers cheat consumers by whipping the ice cream with air so it fills more space.  In India, this ice cream company needed to figure out how to make it weigh more.  So, they added Lead Oxide to the ice cream and poisoned thousands of people."

But, everyone else here is correct, you need to tear this thing down and rebuild it.  It's dangerous as hell.  If it fell on someone, it would probably kill them."
DIY,ff72v2a,t3_er6ks0,1579640019.0,"Also note that you probably need a permit to build a deck, which is going to require blueprints that include elevations and such.  I'd probably risk it because I'm back in the woods and no one will know, but if the city catches you, they will most likely make you completely remove the deck.  That's what they do here, any unpermitted building is required to be destroyed."

AdviceAnimals,ff70lxv,t3_eruh1v,1579638733.0,"When I sign up for things, I use tags in my email address so I can figure out who sold my address, and then block them based on the tags.  Most email servers support this, including gmail.

Say your email address is ""me@gmail.com"".  When you sign up for something, add a tag like this:  ""me+sierratradingpost@gmail.com"".  The email will still go to ""me@gmail.com"", but when you start getting spam you'll know exactly who sold your address, and then you can also create rules that throw it in the trash.

I think it's actually part of the SMTP RFC, I've been using it since the mid 1990's, and I've only had a couple of email servers not support it.  And I picked on Sierra Trading Post because if you give them your email address, you get no less than 180 emails a month from them, they are insane."

worldnews,ff456wp,t3_erfcm7,1579555790.0,"Obviously this won't work for every job, but learn to script and leverage tools like robotframework and NodeRed.  As Scrooge McDuck once said, ""work smarter not harder.""  Also, NEVER tell anyone if you automate any of your job, or at least be very careful.  If you replace yourself with code you'll either be out of a job, or get more work piled on you.  And, with your newfound automation skills, you can go get a much higher paying job implementing automation (which is like one of the hottest and highest paying things in IT right now).

Also, hugely important...  learn to say ""no.""  I get about 500 emails a day, and any requests that I won't get fired for not doing, I just don't do them.  I either ignore or say no.  Do the things that matter, and don't bother with the things that don't.  Those people will figure out how to get whatever they wanted some other way (like doing it themselves if it's that important to them).  Everyone in an executive position got there partially because they realized what they had to do, and what they didn't.  If you ever have executive coaching, they will teach you this.  I used to make a list of all the shit that I had to do and split it up into 3 categories:

1. Stuff that I have to do because no one else can and I'll get fired for not doing it.
2. Stuff that needs to be done, but feel comfortable delegating it to one of my employees
3. Useless stuff that I'm not doing or bothering with assigning it to someone.

Item number 1 was the shortest section, and item 3 was always the longest.  Once you get this stuff off your plate, everything is more manageable and you'll do a better job because you can put more effort and time into the things that matter instead of half-assing things so you don't fall behind.  And now that you are doing higher quality work, you're more likely to be promoted."

I can't play the piano. And the concept of having my left hand do something different than my right hand has proven to be pretty difficult on an organ or piano.

But, I still want to learn how to play this piece from beginning to end and have zero interest in learning to play anything else."
