AnimalCrossing,fg7pmhr,t1_ffs0ddd,1580598304.0,"I have him too, and love him, but more in a ""he's a guardian figure to me."" type of way. I visit his house a lot cause he's close to mine. Sometimes he'll say stuff like ""you humans all look the same"" but only cause he knows I'll laugh it off."
AnimalCrossing,fg7pawa,t3_euvcp7,1580598078.0,"Lucky, Pinky, Cyrano, and Flurry. 

Pinky was the first to give me her picture in wild world. She was kind of mean, though, would always say my designs were ugly when she wore them, the furniture I got her was ugly, and yelled at me a lot. But she was a reality check for tiny me. I could see past her cruel exterior into her lovely pink soul. Once, she was in boxes, and I convinced her to stay... I was so, so glad.

Lucky was also in wild world with me, and I believe I eventually got his picture. I was constantly giving him fossils, bones for my favorite dog. He was lazy, which clicked well with me. We had many conversations about food, and he never grew angry or tired of me. Always down to chill or muck around in a fun competition or fetch quest.

Cyrano, Cyrano, Cyrano. One would think he seems out of place as the only Japanese-type villager in town, but he gets along reasonably well with others. In acnl they made grumpies more of a ""gruff but caring old man"" type which really resonated with me. He has a weird but funny sense of humor. I planted exotic fruits around his house.

Flurry is from acnl. She's such a sweet and cute normal villager, and her house is just darling. She's never spoken a cruel word to me, but that could be because they nerfed villager personalities in nl.  I love her bookish and soft demeanor and how smol she is, her whole aesthetic. In pocket camp, she looks just stunning in mint glasses and a snow shirt, by the way.

There's many others but these are my top four: two from my childhood and two from more recent times. In the end I have to go with Lucky as my favorite, though. Lazy is my favorite personality type."

TooAfraidToAsk,fg3q5mk,t1_fg3npi7,1580487275.0,"Dude, there's a short boy at my high school who's one of the ""popular"" crowd. People generally like him and he's in a lot of clubs and stuff. 

Honestly I think a lot of the ""women hate short people"" is an overblown meme, combined with the fact that rude conversations on Tinder ect are the ones more likely to get screenshot and posted online. People post and like the negative interactions, but few post a normal, happy dating convo. It's not dramatic or juicy.

Another thing, you can't demand a service or favor from someone while also demeaning them. Calling all women superficial while whining about wanting to date one is like calling the fast food worker stupid while ordering your chicken nuggets at midnight."

As for Cirrus, I thought of them mostly neutral but maybe a lil teensy bit fem cause the plural of Cirrus is Cirri and Siri and Siri is depicted as a girl... but yeah, mostly nb vibes from them."
