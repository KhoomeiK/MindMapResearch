Because what they're doing is as infringing as it is stupid. I would not cry for a single lost job at the TSA.

People use the argument of ""protecting jobs"" like jobs were an endangered species, but we really ought to be protecting people's general welfare so we don't have to worry about their livelihoods as we reimagine the workforce for an automated era. ***A LOT*** of whole categories of work are on the chopping block. That's not what scares me. What scares me is ensuring that we can appropriately mete out the unprecedented wealth of American society (and more generally, tech-industrialized societies) to work for the whole society and not just the elite capital holders, as we become less reliant on human labor for our goods and services.

And it's not like the TSA taught these 50,000 ""unskilled workers"" any externally applicable skills. So let's not credit them as a workforce-bolstering government program.

I think it's all gawdy, and I hate seeing McDonald's and Starbucks while I'm travelling abroad. But I don't think the people watching our movies and eating our hamburgers think our culture is all a joke. Not like our politics certainly are. But the politics of a place is not its culture.
