Honestly though it'd be no different than a woman and a man having consensual sex and then the woman tells him by the way my boobs are fake, I wear a wig, and I have a prosthetic leg (or even vice versa). That's just my logic on it."

Consensual sex is consensual regardless if someone used to have different parts. So tell the dude that said that he's an idiot if you haven't already."

When I started Wing Chun Do I realized really quick how much body mechanics made things more practical and effective. I still use bits and pieces of the Tae Kwon Do  and other various systems I've picked up. Primarily though I feel that Kung Fu in general is much more efficient and energy conscious. Not sure if this is exactly what you were looking for, but hopefully it helps."

Also, I have an old lab pit mix.  Two years ago she rag dolled one of the kittens I'd rescued.  My vet and every farmer I talked to said you can't blame the dog, especially if it hasn't had exposure to smaller animals.  Same way I was told to not blame the same dog for smoking 4 of my hens (we were both new to farm life). The dog didn't know any better it either just played too rough or thought it was a squeaky toy.  Best of luck getting your puppy back."

Explain yourself as you've done, admit the wrong and be willing to pay a fine even if it's higher than normal to avoid points on your license.  Forget the stuff about grades etc, as the guy above said it doesn't matter.  I saw a kid same age about 10 years ago in MI.  He was doing 80 in a 45 and got off no points paying $150.  If you get lucky this can happen, if not, take the lumps and lesson learned."
