So we’ve been scraping barrel on every government benefit since I found out I was pregnant. 

We agreed that I’d stay home, and when my daughters around 2yrs old I’ll get a job. Unfortunately my daughter got diagnosed with T1 diabetes at a yr old. So any thought of working went out the window, when her blood is so hard to maintain with a toddler, and since she only gets a medical assistant for free in school. I now have to wait until I am 26 before I can get a entry level job. 

Although on the good side, this is my partners last year in his apprenticeship. So we won’t have to rely on any benefits except my daughters medical needs after this year.

There’s 2 bosses, and the one that wasn’t a brother was screaming at this spoilt shit for a full 2 weeks before he was stripped of his new position. And told he can get the job back after studying. And the icing on the cake, my partner told the bosses he was taking over for him and asked for the job. They instead told him to stay in his lane, and not to ask about the job again.

breakingmom,ff1wf1i,t1_ff0zlag,1579487712.0,"The more you let him get away with now, the worse it’s going to be when the kids older. He’ll make sure you know it’s always up to you to do everything, and he’s nothing but a sack of meat that moans when asked to do things, which annoys you into doing it instead. 

He should be up until 11pm with baby and you switch, that way he gets to sleep, and so do you. This is what my partner and I did, and he left for work at a 5:45am.

Edit: also you need to sleep more then an hr straight. Otherwise you put yourself and your baby in danger. Everyone thinks eh no one sleeps as a new mum, not 3months into a baby. You need sleep, or don’t ever drive, or go near roads."

My mate pinned me To the wall from coming out of the toilet, and jammed her tongue down my throat, while groping me. I am a tiny person, so I basically just stood there and took it until she let me go. I was so angry but she was so drunk she just walked off, before I could say anything. 

Next day I told her not to touch me ever again. And she just kept touching me and saying that it’s ok we’re friends, I’m not really into you. But it’s funny because we’re girls /s."
