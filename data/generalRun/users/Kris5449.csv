The lady behind the counter wasn’t the warmest, and wasn’t professional towards the young staff at all. I’m guessing that’s the owner you speak of. I don’t care if they are employees, or her children, or foster children, or even if they are in some sort of community reform program, correct, coach and discipline your staff in a professional manner ESPECIALLY if customers can see and hear you!"

ADHD,ffe3n0j,t3_emgqwy,1579835836.0,"I’m on adderall, so not sure if it’s the same, but I take mine an hour before I need to wake up (first dose 6am) then I take my second around 2 pm. If it’s a difficult day, I allow myself to take my second at one. If it’s a day I need to extend my functionality, I’ll extend to 4 or 5.  My doc lets me make these little adjustments because she knows I’m very meticulous already (ASD), and she know I won’t allow myself to venture too far from my path.

My S.O. prefers to take his daily dose in three smaller doses roughly at 7-11-3 and adjusts accordingly depending on his schedule, but keeps them basically spread out as “wake up” “get to work” “2/3 through shift”

Hope that helps"

News flash. No one wants to go to your wedding! They are simply willing to go, out of respect.  That’s why you feed them. 

If you charge them admission, they won’t go partially because they don’t want to, partially because they don’t want to pay, and mostly because they no longer respect you. 

I wonder how the cost of admission effected the gift pile. “$200 Cuisinart returned... here’s your $50 and your congratulations card.”"
loveland,fepqyfo,t1_feppn7f,1579328315.0,"Actually yes. We got a rat for a foster snake we had, and they became fast friends. I didn’t have the housing or desire to have a rat but wanted him to have a chance at life, so a took a box (long 12 pack soda can box), filled it with news papers, put him in the box, and set the box outside under a tree (It was summer) so he could find a new home, but had a safe place to hide until he felt safe enough to wander off. Three days later, I walked out back to pick up the box, and guess who was living happily inside, and wandered out to meet me... mr rat.  At that point, I dubbed him a miracle rat, named him, and got on Craigslist to find him a forever home. A sweet gal in Longmont met me at work to pick him up, and they lived happily ever after.

BeardedDragons,fepattv,t3_eq7l1l,1579316031.0,"I disagree with the other poster. 
We love our mercury vapor bulbs (zoo-med brand). Our vet recommended it and our boys are doing great with them. They’re more expensive than the fluorescent tube, but they last twice as long as the tube we were using.  I have nothing against online shopping, and I bet chewy is fine, but skip amazon for this. You wanna know where you’re getting your bulb, and that it’s as advertised, and hasn’t been sitting in a where house somewhere, or was purchased in a liquidation sale or something.  It’s your little buddy’s life support, so skimp elsewhere. We saved quite a bit by going to petsmart or petco during their after thanksgiving sale, and all lights were buy one get one free. Sometimes I see them 25-30% off too. Just keep your eyes peeled a month or two before it’s time to replace it.

I’m sure yours is fine, and I’m sure the fluorescent ones the other poster recommended are fine too. It’s all personal preference as long as you’re not buying them at Home Depot or some unknown retailer that doesn’t specialize in reptiles/pets."
