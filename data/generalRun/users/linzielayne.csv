Panic Disorder is often managed in the beginning with medication, but it's important for you to get a true diagnosis. I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder before it became apparent that I had panic disorder, and it's possible you're suffering with something similar.

A doctor is your first step if you can afford it and have access- try to write down everything you want to discuss with them and ask them. Everyone here understands you, though our posts tend to be markedly panicked and sometimes disorganized and lonely, which is pretty characteristic of the illness.

Someone recommended DARE and I agree it can be very helpful if you're able to use the system. Other ways to manage the attacks themselves as opposed to lifestyle difficulties are box breathing, meditation, and exposure therapy (which is rough). I have personally found that ""what is the worst thing that can happen"" is helpful, but I'm in late states of a fairly well-managed condition and this doesn't usually work for those still caught in the early grips, especially if hypochondria or heart symptoms are involved.

You absolutely can get better but it will no doubt take time and effort. Glad you found us and good luck!"

personalfinance,fclh2st,t3_ehr97n,1577747629.0,"I would suggest delaying thinking about college and focus on graduating from high school. Waiting a year or two isn't a bad idea for anyone, and since your situation can change for the better in that time don't let the idea that you won't be able to go get you down. Was there an inciting incident that made this happen? I'm not in any way blaming you, but if there's a way for you to alter your lifestyle in a way that will allow your guardians to allow you to keep living with them until you graduate I would suggest doing anything you can. Can your brother speak with them on your behalf?

Since it seems like it's just them arbitrarily removing you from the home, I'm so sorry. What a terrible thing to have happen to you at such a young age. Do you have any family that isn't nearby? Maybe if you arranged for a place to go immediately upon graduating your family would allow you to stay until then. It seems unimaginably cruel for them to kick you out into the streets. If you have family who will take you now, go to them and discuss credits at a school near them. It's better to have somewhere to live- without it, graduating will be very difficult.

Talk to your school- they should be able to get you in touch with social services who *should* (and I'm stressing should because it isn't a definite) be able to help you find a place to stay or at least pressure your guardians into allowing it. In the time you have before you graduate, focus on finding a part time job that might be able to move you to full time once you're done with school."
