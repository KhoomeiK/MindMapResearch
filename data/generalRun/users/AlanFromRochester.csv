Khal, king, literally meaning horse lord makes sense given their horse-centric culture. (khalasar = horde, for example)

The dictionary ([https://docs.dothraki.org/Dothraki.pdf](https://docs.dothraki.org/Dothraki.pdf)) also lists koalak = healer and koalakeesi = female healer, which tells me -eesi is simply a female modifier, like actress vs. actor in English. khalakki = princess and khalakka = prince also seem neutral. chiorikem = wife is related to words starting with kem for marriage. 'chiori' is 'woman', 'wife' literally being 'woman spouse', like mahrazh = man and mahrazhkem = husband. some other kem- words have to do with alliances. so at worst the etymology seems to refer to arranged marriages. 

The Dothraki dictionary also lists vik = chin and vikeesi = annoying woman, not PC but not as misogynist as what you think is the case."
