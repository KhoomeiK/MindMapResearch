interestingasfuck,ffuda16,t1_ffsqgd0,1580239539.0,Cats were rimming long before the hipsters started doing it
unpopularopinion,ffu0xig,t3_ev7pa6,1580232112.0,"Good point. The and/or really highlights what many miss. You don't have to be jacked and rich and funny and smart and (i hope) well hung. Just play to your strengths. And dont buy tight clothes, if ... uh ... necessary."
BrandNewSentence,ffu079u,t3_ev73o6,1580231624.0,Is tf shortform for wtf?
unpopularopinion,fftzbhq,t1_fftt1eh,1580231007.0,What makes you say that? What if you're a girl who isn't interested in the same stuff as most your girlfriends or vice versa? If you're accusing someone of having issues it seems like you gotta have evidencem
unpopularopinion,fft3khe,t3_ev2zua,1580205222.0,"What genres do you enjoy? I guarantee this community could disprove your theory. It's certainly true that the market is more saturated than ever, but the best artists will stand the test of time.


Though I really like your optimism that our standards will be going up sometime."
DnD,ffrul6e,t3_euvign,1580166170.0,"They look awesome, well done."
quityourbullshit,ffru9sy,t1_ffrr2is,1580165966.0,"I suppose it's bullshit in the broader sense (shitty behaviour, not just lies), but if we count that then this sub would have no meaning, no point. Imagine!"
unpopularopinion,ffrts90,t1_ffrsz14,1580165656.0,"Yeah glad someone else noticed this. The opinion is reasonable, the argument could be better."
unpopularopinion,ffrsz8i,t1_ffrcmpu,1580165147.0,"Everybody thinks differently. You can't paint everyone with the same brush, and you certainly can't assume that everyone cares about or pays attention to their kids. There are so many factors. I know it feels nice to have simple answers, but the truth is usually complicated."
MovieDetails,ffrcn6u,t1_ffrbhm5,1580155304.0,"Seriously, there isn't even ambiguity here. OP thanks for a cool little detail. Glad someone has eyes to see what's in front of them."
nextfuckinglevel,ffrc00l,t1_ffr88ey,1580154908.0,Anything's possible if you're trying something else
quityourbullshit,ffrbjrh,t3_eushvl,1580154635.0,They're either being ironic or trolling. You may want to learn to read subtle cues.
unpopularopinion,ffraqfc,t1_ffr1tj7,1580154137.0,"If you sit by and watch someone commit a crime you are an accessory. Surely if you create the circumstances that led to a crime, due to negligence, a similar logic can be applied?"
unpopularopinion,ffralak,t1_ffr2ymk,1580154051.0,"You need to remember that people are biased in favour of their children ""he's not a recluse, he's just a bit shy or introverted"". It's that simple, so they aren't going to see red flags right in front if them. I agree with your overall opinion tbh, but this argument incorrectly assumes that parents view their children objectively."
movies,ffr7g2m,t3_euqyzg,1580152101.0,"You can't truly understand a man's personality without knowing the major things he did. If your friend idolizes Hitler, who did such awful things, then he's just an asshole looking for an excuse to hate. Plus you cant say that his ignorance isn't his fault if he's choosing not to read and educate himself. It's willing ignorance and idealizing hatred however you look at it."
unpopularopinion,ffr6hv0,t1_ffr3tyn,1580151507.0,"Surely the cyclist is at greater risk on the road around vehicles, whereas the pedestrian is the one more at risk on the pavement/sidewalk?"
unpopularopinion,ffqgn93,t3_eundel,1580134036.0,"Honestly I think 99% is conservative. If a picture tells a 1000 words why must we always add 5 more anyway? Plus it always used to be you share a joke and it's shared as it is. With memes people feel they have to put a twist on it so they aren't stealing/reposting, so going overboard is innevitable.


Everyone has a camera nowadays, so I'd rather see the challenge of taking pictures that are already funny."
MurderedByWords,ffqfh93,t1_ffqe0t5,1580133040.0,"""I think they can't be trusted"" probably."
