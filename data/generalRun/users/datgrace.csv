Vaping,ffa13oq,t3_es557g,1579725763.0,"can anyone recommend me a good pen style ecig? i've got the endura t18e currently, done me well for the last few months but i've already had one in the past and the battery gets fucked after a while, and it leaks a lot. it only cost about £15-20 so i'm looking for one in a higher price range that'll last me a lot longer.

good battery life is a plus"
depression,ff97n25,t3_es7cc3,1579706735.0,"The thing is it’s pretty common for friends to tease each other, obviously they shouldn’t about things that you’ve specifically mentioned make you feel insecure but when they’re in the moment they might not consider as much how it hurts your feelings

So there’s the side of your friends, they can definitely change their behaviour and if they don’t they’re dicks. But then there’s also your side of things, why are you insecure about these things? They may appear minor to your friends so they wonder why they bother you. Insecurity is understandable, I used to and still do to some extent suffer from insecurity but over time I’ve learned to accept my insecurities and now I don’t get angry and cry when something is mentioned about my insecurities like I used to. I can accept teasing etc. and learned to give back what they say to me.

It would be hard for your friends to avoid triggering all of your insecurities so they might be walking on eggshells - that’s expected and shows they’re trying to not hurt you. If that makes you feel bad then you need to take this time to accept your insecurities."

leagueoflegends,femth1b,t1_femri7n,1579269137.0,well if there were loads of the same powerful race/people then the idea of them being 'champions' doesn't work so well. why jax instead of jimmy the other purple dude

i preferred him being a straight up werewolf rather than some chemical gimp monkey, i like his new abilities and voiceover he just looks a bit cartoony now in my opinion rather than a scary werewolf"

ketamine,fe5hv5x,t3_engcvh,1578869622.0,big shards = reduced surface area = less efficient ketamine and more down the back of your throat
ketamine,fe3nhd4,t1_fe2l6v0,1578850999.0,If you don’t expect it sure but I do a lot of ket for the sole purpose of holing so a lot of weird shit goes on
ketamine,fe3nfb5,t1_fe2kt9l,1578850969.0,No it’s more similar to mushrooms but it’s powdered
ketamine,fdzvbkh,t1_fdzsveh,1578796657.0,rocky ket is probably my favourite type i think it's much easier to hole with it compared to shards

ketamine,fdzmqwa,t3_enfvaj,1578791807.0,"that much once a month is unlikely to cause much harm, although it is quite a lot to have in one or two sessions

i tend to have max 1g, i'd definitely do more if i had it in my possession so that's just the amount i restrict myself to"
ketamine,fdzmi7q,t3_enfsjn,1578791720.0,"i don't really do any other drugs, i really love ket. wouldn't say it's necessarily addicting but i do crave it a lot as it's a good escape i tend to restrict myself to once every month and i get it all out my system with a large amount over a couple days"
ketamine,fdzma9i,t1_fdzkghc,1578791635.0,"source lmfao? generally after having a huge k hole it takes a while to get back in a normal mindset, kinda hard to sleep when you feel like you're on a rollercoaster mate"
ketamine,fdz42eb,t1_fdz3y1n,1578786428.0,"fair enough i've always found shards better for raves cos i can't hole as easily, if i'm chilling on my own i much prefer rock to send me insane"
ketamine,fdz3fq3,t1_fdv1p8p,1578786298.0,"hard disagree, you can't really make assumptions just cos it's rocky or shardy. depends on how they cook it up to get the form of rock or shards... and the potency also depends on if it's s isomer or r isomer with s being way more potent"
ketamine,fdz2y1n,t1_fdz2d5e,1578786135.0,"bigphil has been amazing for years, had a dodge EC result a few months ago but it's all gucci now. back to cottageindustry if he's on vacation then"
ketamine,fdz23vr,t3_en2rn8,1578785860.0,ketamine comes as rocks or shards
ketamine,fdz1c83,t1_fdxmdn6,1578785700.0,lol... there's literally no reason to believe it's fake other than what OP says in my experience most ket is variable quality but real
ketamine,fdyzcvg,t1_fdyy5ak,1578785118.0,"lol... many people struggle to sleep after ketamine specifically. ketamine comes in rocks or shards. because it's rock doesn't mean it's another drug. it's produced differently to shard ket and comes as large rocks, it doesn't come out the chemical lab all grinded up m8

tests from september dnstars:

cottageindustry rock ket: 81% ketamine"
ketamine,fdyy8p6,t1_fdxr9es,1578784742.0,"mate you don't know what you're talking about tbh, there are some amazing vendors you're literally buying from shit tier vendors. for a start if the vendor describes it as rhino ket don't buy it from them lmao, marketing bullshit. try bigphil101 never been disappointed always sends me out my mind"
ketamine,fdyxrqm,t3_en80g0,1578784654.0,"it's pretty common to get rock ketamine... i purchase from bigphil101 or cottageindustry who both have amazing rock. idk how you can just tarnish them all as being 2FDCK, have you even tested it? how can you try like 5 vendors and just say it's all a completely different drug? maybe you just have wrong expectations of what ketamine is like, compared to what i get on the streets darknet ketamine is light years ahead.

DC rock ket was tested a few months ago as 71% ketamine and no cuts... not the best quality but pure ket at least. the same tests showed cottageindustry 81% which is some of the highest purity i've seen. LW shards 77%.

the fact i haven't seen bigphil101 or cottageindustry (all consistently tested as high quality ket +honourable mention for LetsWork) in this thread... you're ordering from peasant vendors and i've never really ordered from them as they never seemed like great quality, always hit and miss"
ketamine,fdyxjkx,t3_en4cda,1578784582.0,"if i go for a k-hole dose, then yeah it gets impossible to sleep. if i have a small amount i'm usually fine though"
ketamine,fdyx9p2,t1_fdyuj8q,1578784493.0,yeah i think it's definitely more potent i've had some insane holes on rock but less so on shard. shard seems to get me super fucked up but never in a full hole... probably better if you went to a festival and wanted k
ketamine,fdyx5dn,t1_fdytryi,1578784447.0,"yeah for sure, i think it's much harder to break up compared to lil shards"
ketamine,fdyshq0,t1_fdy1v33,1578783122.0,"yeah that's a good way to describe it, you feel like the fabric of reality has broken down completely! not only because of the way it changes your thought process in a different way to psychedelics, but also the way it disconnects you from your senses and causes weird geometrical hallucinations like your room shrinking"
ketamine,fdysa2u,t3_enclno,1578783049.0,"have a huge line of ket, pretty easy and more forgiving than psychedelics as in hard to have a bad trip. you can definitely experience some kind of ego death but it's different to psychedelic ego death as ket is a disso. 80mg of 4-aco-dmt insufflated took me straight there"

ketamine,fdqmsp6,t3_emr1mw,1578670374.0,"i mean, it is pretty rare to have proper bladder problems with ket. it might be unrelated. you could always go to the GP and just say you're having pain in your bladder and say you're really worried. you can't really stop the damage other than drinking a lot of water

but i don't think a bit of pain and needing to piss more is a clear symptom"
worldnews,fdpox3o,t1_fdntt40,1578635076.0,"a defector in the past has had to retract their story. i read a more realistic blog from someone who escaped DPRK, he actually got let out of the reeducation camp (he killed his uncle) and his parents would visit to give him food. obviously the conditions were horrible but it seems different to the idea you get from the media of it being a literal nazi concentration camp"
worldnews,fdporp3,t1_fdn5a34,1578634930.0,i'm glad people can at least see some north korean stuff is completely false. terrible dictatorship but there's no need to believe fake stories in the news.
worldnews,fdnuuq8,t1_fdnnk08,1578593305.0,"I feel like China has much more kind of ‘executive power’ being pretty much a communist state though and without having to worry about opposing political parties and votes, makes it far easier for them to implement these kind of policies"
worldnews,fdnunpn,t1_fdneg4i,1578593189.0,I would say China is violating human rights on an even more massive scale compared to North Korea considering the population levels and the fact we don’t know the true figures or even what goes on nowadays inside DPRK political ‘re-education’ camps asides from what defectors have said. Then consider the fact China also has wider goals internationally and outside of their own country unlike North Korea and they’re a much greater threat to everyone!
worldnews,fdnud3d,t1_fdnaova,1578593013.0,"Tbf I feel like Australia has a much more sensitive environment compared to other areas of the world, so it’s gonna be way more difficult maintaining prestige conditions there for protected species in niche habitats"

leagueoflegends,fdfbihy,t1_fdf8oej,1578357793.0,"I play both too but I feel like it's favoured towards Morde, that's probably because I have like 400k morde mastery and I don't play vs great Darius though.
