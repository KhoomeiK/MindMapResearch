Disneyland,ffj5o35,t3_etib9t,1579991029.0,Is haunted Mansion down?!
mildlyinteresting,ffc4rhw,t1_ffc4bqx,1579791504.0,Well sir... I disagree but I'll upvote you for having an opinion and sticking to it.
mildlyinteresting,ffc0d68,t1_ffbfg71,1579788289.0,"You're going to look at that bottom feeding cockroach and think ""I bet that's yummy"" ?... On top of being salty as fuck their meat is shit meat.. literally they eat rotten shit . Do you look at a buzzard and think ""I bet it's white meat is tender as fuck!"""
politics,ffbbdqj,t3_esb61e,1579758427.0,She's trying to tank his campaign the way she blames him for tanking hers... Except the only person she has to blame is herself for decades of bad faith leadership and shameless power grabs.
mildlyinteresting,ffb9ahi,t3_esn516,1579755895.0,Fuck seafood is gross.
StreetFights,ffatkjl,t1_ffaj5gd,1579744170.0,I genuinely think it's a racial think .. white girls are all about the stahhp bullshit. Mexican/black girls tend to step in after shit is clearly done and stand over their dudes to protect them.
Fallout,ff97lax,t1_ff8mqpb,1579706703.0,I wish I could upvote this more. This is exactly my feeling. Same when people want to move it to Hawaii or Europe .. that's not fallout.
Fallout,ff89w8f,t3_es0liq,1579670346.0,Nope.
LeopardsAteMyFace,ff4tmqy,t1_ff4nr2a,1579572159.0,"I disagree, the royal family is a centuries old institution with rules that all royals hate but follow. The public support for the royals is oddly high in England, and stepping in -as essentially a foreigner- trying to change that is a huge gaff and slap in the face. It's not surprising at all that the media would jump on that to sell papers. Didn't they shit all over Kate for wearing her short sun dresses ... It's manufactured outrage, not racism."
aww,ff41ho7,t3_erdfrg,1579553492.0,Pussy just seems to love this guy
LeopardsAteMyFace,ff3w86j,t1_ff26rdc,1579550206.0,Isn't the issue though how much she tried to change and modernize established norms? Like adding yoga studios to palaces that are hundreds of years old...
tight_shorts,ff0l9cm,t1_ff0jkt8,1579469904.0,Yea they're gorgeous but that throws me off

AskReddit,fenb882,t1_fekxese,1579280964.0,"Okay, so what's the best way to not get caught in that whole ""murdered my neighbor for justified reasons"" situation?
 
Edit: I instantly regret not making it clear this is a joke"
DIY,fenak5q,t1_fen9nyl,1579280544.0,I was mainly cracking a joke. The treehouse guru sells these floating anchors that are less intrusive on the tree and also allows the tree to flex and move without being stressed and damaging limbs.
politics,fen9co2,t1_felasoq,1579279802.0,This is one of my favorite episode of parks and rec.
politics,fen933g,t1_femcrai,1579279642.0,"Stormie makes considerably more then just 2k a scene. Event before all this she was probably up to the 5or 6k per scene and to my knowledge she's never done gang bangs. Your average porn star makes about 1k a scene/day depending on negotiations and star power. 
 
But your points not lost that he definitely didn't need to spend 200k to bang a whore."

politics,fen0pzc,t1_felv60a,1579274368.0,"Truthfully taking a knee to is about the most respectful display of protest you could make. Now.. if Colin wanted to be a dick ... He would have turned around and showed his back to the flag (that would be infuriating) but no, dude just took a knee to start the conversation."

history,fdzx7yg,t1_fdzwsd5,1578798001.0,"Oh wow very cool, still my suggestion to not just go digging around a ww1or2 battle site is valid. I was referring to civil war and before, you're much less likely to blow yourself up."
history,fdxifa8,t1_fdxh8ja,1578768994.0,You wouldn't want to do that in ww1 or 2 trenches but yes. People find random old artifact all the time. You might get lucky and find buttons or a lost bayonet but chances of finding anything - historic/valuable/in good condition- is extremely rare. More of a cool show and tell piece.

history,fdtptue,t1_fdtkhbt,1578720340.0,"True true, question... Where did England get the raw materials for it's factories? Or the fuel for it's second strongest navy on earth? Or it's aluminum for it's RAF? Or it's food to feed it's citizens? I wasn't trying to cut anyone out, merely pointing out that the contribution of the united states is oft over looked and undervalued."
Blonde,fds9qsi,t1_fdp3xlg,1578697611.0,"Apparently in Europe it's a thing... Or was a thing. It's called ""sharking"" but like most of these kinds of vids it's mainly fake or staged. But you can find some real ones if you're into it."
history,fdrpb5d,t1_fdr3sxo,1578687688.0,"If you remove the United States entirely from the equation then the nazis had a very real shot at winning. The Soviets had the men, the will and the area in which to fight, but not the raw materials or food to survive the war. The unites States provides everything from raw material to finished products ranging from bullets, guns, artillery, machine parts, spare parts, flour, wheat, medical equipment and supplies. So the Soviets may have been inevitable winners but only with the backing of the US, otherwise the Germans could have very likely have held out enough territory to slowly grind down the Soviets."
