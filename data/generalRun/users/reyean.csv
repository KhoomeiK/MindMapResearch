news,ffotc42,t1_ffoodnq,1580081508.0,"No, no we dont. It is a terrible tragedy and I wish her and her family the best during this trying time. 

I'm just saying that I have more empathy for the no name person who suddenly lost their sole breadwinner and now has no means of income to support themselves. Possible they were already on hard times and this loss might make them homeless. This happens daily and no one gives a shit. Commentor said it doesn't matter, I'm saying it does. Not saying the loss sucks any less just saying it's nice to have one (a major one at that) less thing to worry about.

I know reddit has mourning wood for the inspirational human we just lost but idk, I'm always weirded out how we fetishize celebrity deaths when on a scale way worse shit happens daily. I actually find lack of empathy for the less notable deaths to be a part of a larger, global problem. 

I understand this sentiment is quite downvotable but it's ok, it seems we are all hurting today."
LivestreamFail,ffoq8g7,t1_ffo004p,1580080444.0,"Depends on your qualifier. I dont know who this person is so it's the same to me as any of the other tons of deaths that occur daily. Kobe is a bigger name that may have affected more people, but as far as the greater population is concerned, just another death. 

Yes, inspirational people have been lost. People who meant things to society or a group or culture. Mourning is a valid and correct response. Do I feel inspired to carry on certain traits like striving to be my best or to be a good person? Yes. But is today any different than any other day? I personally say no, it's just another day.

So the day being good or bad or not, is entirely up to you."

> As most circuits the finish line is in a different place to the start line, towards the back of the grid. At Monaco, however, it’s where the start line is. Wirdheim didn’t realise this fact, so when he came on to the pit straight for the final time he slowed down to celebrate with his team, thinking he’d already won. He hadn’t. 
He realised his mistake and floored it, but it was too late - future Minardi driver Nicolas Kiesa has already gone past to snatch the victory."

The status of Biden’s work in Ukraine is public record. The opinions of the democratic and republican colleagues alike are on record of supporting his work in Ukraine.

Not in these circumstances so its a moot point. 

None of those things serve to uncover why a sitting president would withold aid money in an attempt to dig dirt on a political opponent.
