cars,fffccly,t1_fffc9q5,1579880842.0,Good to know. I never tried to enable it on my F80 for whatever reason.
cars,fff8bcl,t1_ffemrgg,1579878222.0,Correct. There is no button by default but the lights are there and functional. Easy to install a button. Source: Did so in my old e9x
realdubstep,ffeei9k,t1_ffeefvi,1579845014.0,Bad bot
realdubstep,ffeeew9,t1_ff9ynp3,1579844920.0,So true. I just wish he released on vinyl. Thankfully the cassette includes digital but I'm not trying to hook up a tape deck to my system :D
YouShouldKnow,ffcxwyk,t1_ff4wjyi,1579809556.0,I don’t run plates normally so YMMV
smarthome,ffchhz2,t1_ffa4u4s,1579799571.0,Middle class consumers aren't going to drop $10-$15k on a security drone. Maybe if the tech takes off with the rich a cheaper version will emerge with time as many technologies do.

concealedcarry,ff4iluh,t3_ergamk,1579564495.0,"Been wearing a Crossbreed for the better part of 15 years now. Hands down my go-to holster. I've carried everything from an XD9, G19, to Shield in one and love how they feel. 

Warranty is top notch too. Had an incident where I cracked mine and they replaced it fast with no questions asked."
YouShouldKnow,ff45baj,t1_ff3yjkk,1579555865.0,I prefer Trident Layers.
YouShouldKnow,ff3cht5,t1_ff36f95,1579538422.0,Pocketknife usually fits nicely through the speaker grille.
Citrix,fezyrlu,t1_feowqj7,1579463371.0,"I feel this way often. Like watching a child grow up. Built the system from the ground up. We're at 15k\~ concurrent across 3 datacenters, everything running well and fine tuned. Very easy to maintain anymore. Our management just decided they don't want to renew Citrix anymore because $$$ and ""uSeR eXpeRieNcE"". They are now giving us basically 4-6 months to switch all users over to VMware Horizon/WS1. I wish I could personally afford to have walked out of the building on the day they announced it. This is going to be a shitshow 100%."
ProtonMail,fezi3kh,t3_eqw2e4,1579457604.0,"The tilde character is acceptable for the local-part of an email address, at least according to the RFC. Not sure if Proton allows all various symbols to be used in the creation of emails. 

I can say that sending to ~@mydomain.tld does work for me - but I have a pro account with catch-all."
audiophile,fewk78x,t1_fetbwaw,1579412415.0,"When I was a teen, I was friends with the son of the founder of Krell. I’ll never forget the first time listening to their personal system. Even as a dumb kid, I knew it was something special. To this day, some 20 years later I remember it vividly."

Ubiquiti,fekgx0y,t1_fekgqkh,1579199807.0,Good find! Damn that 18U is cheap! Thanks
CCW,fekct6j,t1_fejscsq,1579197358.0,"Your building may be much less secure than you think. Badge access alone does not make a building ‘secure’. It’s just a layer that in many cases is easily defeated (low tech and high tech methods). 

I can get in many ‘secure’ office buildings with a can of Dust Off or a hook tool. 

Obviously your circumstances may vary and your building may take more steps for security. Just don’t want you to have a false sense of safety because of badge access."
Ubiquiti,fekayy0,t1_fejxmnu,1579196270.0,"Just an FYI, they (NavePoint) have a 22U for $335 on Amazon now (with Prime). Been eyeing these lately myself. Can get a 42U APC secondhand for $200 or so in my area though. Can't justify the $600+ half-cabinets."
SimpleBanking,fec6yi2,t1_fec6fyc,1578967708.0,Do you have a Simple shared account? I could likely have instant transferred to Shared account and then to Schwab. Your mortgage folks/underwriting will likely want to source the funds but that’s a pain in itself.
SimpleBanking,fec5vh9,t1_fec5iaa,1578967138.0,Yes of course
realdubstep,fe6gz77,t1_fe6guup,1578890601.0,Unfortunately no. Pretty sure it is unreleased / dubplate. Definitely a tune though!

ProtonMail,fe4obbf,t3_enspd8,1578861316.0,They are well funded and I've yet to have any issues in the last year or so. I recommend using your own domain in case something does go wrong in the future. Just switch some DNS records and you don't lose any new emails.
AppleCard,fcrvud0,t3_ei7ai1,1577907313.0,Usually put it towards the balance before paying it off completely. Bought my AirPod Pros when they came out with cash back. Will probably do something similar with my December cash. Almost $300 but I had a good bit of large purchases last month.
sysadmin,fcr1lb9,t1_fcqf26r,1577895437.0,Any deadlines we missed we just pushed to later this week. I think we won’t get paid for some Medicare stuff until then but oh well.
COGuns,fcmj5hd,t1_fcmitqb,1577777397.0,"You able to do something similar for someone with an expired permit? Denver county screwed me on my renewal. 

Hoping now that I’m in Arapahoe I can re-apply."
garageporn,fcgdjp8,t1_fcg0jjs,1577638889.0,I’m in the same boat. But he’s in Florida. I want to see how it does in cold climates with dirty snow melting off the cars onto the floor. Is it more or less of a pain to clean all that dirt than epoxy?
motorcycles,fc1uwgs,t1_fc1b0o5,1577330474.0,My favorite is riding up Mt Evans in Colorado at 2AM. Certain death on one side of the road if anything goes wrong. No cell service and nothing around for miles.
AppleCard,fc12a4b,t1_fc124cs,1577306207.0,"Sounds like something they’d do. Guess I’d have to switch to a functional card, file a claim with the bureaus, and wait for the first chance to close."
AppleCard,fc11y5t,t1_fc11u0f,1577305937.0,True. Some purchases were nearly 90% of the fairly low CL. Have to pay several times per month to keep it low/under limit. Just got a CLI but still about half of my monthly spend unfortunately.
homesecurity,fc119jf,t1_fbzmscx,1577305377.0,"You can keep the key nearby, just out of reach."
