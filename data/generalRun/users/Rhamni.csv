CryptoCurrency,ffkay1y,t1_ffkagyt,1580019813.0,>Rumours are circulating that the team is working on a revamp of the website. Time to fill up.
memes,ffk3xip,t1_ffk32a2,1580015061.0,"It's probably only relevant for old games up to the SNES era or so. Basically, the low resolutions back then meant that pixels were big enough that it made sense for some games to track your position more precisely than the screen could represent. So you might be 25% or 50% or 75% through a pixel, and it would *look* the same to the player, but the game is still tracking the difference. And then you want to do something silly like clip your way through a solid wall. And it does work, because these old games often have flaws you can exploit, but sometimes it only works if you are standing in the right subpixel when you perform your trick. So unless you have a trick to manipulate your subpixel, it's effectively random. But it's not *actually* random, because if you do have a trick you can force it to succeed every time.

The runs at events are more fun to me than most normal runs, because you have the couch commentators who also know the game so you get good back and forth on what's happening, and if (when) something goes horribly wrong the runner has to adjust on the fly and use fallback strategies, because there are no resets no matter how cruel RNG or subpixels are being."
memes,ffjz2hs,t1_ffjstfu,1580010904.0,"What's the point of this comment? I watch a lot of speedrunning while bored at work and waiting for something to respond to. The incredible amount of work that goes into getting that rare insane run is neither hidden nor looked down on. The skill to play consistently well and sheer discipline required to train up to that level is incredibly impressive. The best speedrunners also make a good living, because tons of people watch their runs on youtube and twitch.

There are also different categories, some glitchless, some with minor glitches like getting through walls and some 'true any%' where they hunt known glitches to get to the end credits by any means possible. It's all very neat and organised, so people can compete or watch whatever category they like. None is better or worse, it's all about personal preference. So...

I don't think that will gain traction. The medical differences are undeniable - a trans woman simply cannot get pregnant, for example.

I would never want to date a trans person. I don't have anything against them, but I would only ever be comfortable with a cis woman (Cis just means Not Trans). The people I talk to, who are mostly close to me politically, think that's perfectly fine and not controversial. You can't control who you are attracted to. There are those who exclusively date people of a specific race, and that's fine too. You can't control who you're attracted to.

Being polite and calling a trans woman a woman costs you nothing, so I think that should be the default, but obviously if you scratch the surface they are not *quite* the same as a cis woman in some respects. In sports this is getting controversial, but a lot of people on the left - and even the creators of South Park (Very liberal on social issues) think it's obvious you can't just pretend trans women are physically identical to cis women. However, outside of practical, real world issues like that, when you're just interacting with a stranger or casual acquaintance, it costs you nothing to be polite. So as to ""not recognizing trans women as women,"" I, and I think most people, think it's rude and unnecessary to refuse to call them women, although almost everyone is onboard with caveats like *well obviously medically and in athletic competitions excepted*.

I don't think that will gain traction. The medical differences are undeniable - a trans woman simply cannot get pregnant, for example.

I would never want to date a trans person. I don't have anything against them, but I would only ever be comfortable with a cis woman (Cis just means Not Trans). The people I talk to, who are mostly close to me politically, think that's perfectly fine and not controversial. You can't control who you are attracted to. There are those who exclusively date people of a specific race, and that's fine too. You can't control who you're attracted to.

Being polite and calling a trans woman a woman costs you nothing, so I think that should be the default, but obviously if you scratch the surface they are not *quite* the same as a cis woman in some respects. In sports this is getting controversial, but a lot of people on the left - and even the creators of South Park (Very liberal on social issues) think it's obvious you can't just pretend trans women are physically identical to cis women. However, outside of practical, real world issues like that, when you're just interacting with a stranger or casual acquaintance, it costs you nothing to be polite. So as to ""not recognizing trans women as women,"" I, and I think most people, think it's rude and unnecessary to refuse to call them women, although almost everyone is onboard with caveats like *well obviously medically and in athletic competitions excepted*.

So, hating the KKK is not the same as hating children. I'm guessing by 'group of people', they mean groups you have no say in whether you belong to or not. To take it to the extreme, I think everyone is onboard with hating serial killer rapist pedophiles. I doubt even -SENDHELP- above would say ""Oh well, at least they only hurt those damnable children."""

There are many millions of undocumented immigrants in the US, and that's with walls, fences and active deportation efforts. But if there were literally no efforts to enforce the border at all and everyone was accepted, you would see hundreds of millions of immigrants, from South America, Africa and Asia. That *would* strain institutions beyond the breaking point. I'm European, and the free movement agreement we have in the EU comes with some nasty downsides. We can't kick out the people who refuse to work or learn the local language but still demand all the rights, protections and safety nets of citizens. Countries have to enforce borders and protect their own citizens first, doesn't mean other people don't matter, but the distinction in important."

It's a happy, peaceful era for all, with NO infighting from Batman, and NO Superman sliding inevitably toward evil.

He does have to kill a few former superheroes though, but only because they were in his way and saying he has gone too far, which is obviously not acceptable."
