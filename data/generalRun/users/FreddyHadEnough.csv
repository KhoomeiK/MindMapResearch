depression,fffpa3e,t3_etbbf4,1579888844.0,"Try to stay strong.  I know it can be tough.  Read the book ""No time to say good bye"".  It lays out what happens to those we've left behind.  

You are not miserable, fake or worthless.  Those are distortions in the way you're thinking.  That comes with depression.  It really f\*cks with the way we see the world.  Just hang in there and remember you're feeling the way you do because of depression.  Get pissed off with the disease..... don't let it win."
biology,fe624pg,t3_ensf41,1578880078.0,You may have better luck with this question if you ask a bio-anthropologist.    In under grad I took an bio/anthro course where we talked about this type relationship.
depression,fe3sfxn,t3_enpkif,1578852443.0,"I've been there.  It's terrible when it happens and you have so little control.  My house has a bunch of dints in the wall where I've punched it.  I've spent hours just crying as well.  It gets so confusing.  For me, things are now better.  I changed my situation and spent a fair bit of time with therapists and I've got a mix of drugs that seem to work for me.  Hang in there it can get better."
ADHD,fe36plh,t3_ennkrt,1578846514.0,"I'm on Concerta too and it is wonderful, I totally agree.  It's made quite a difference in my life.  Depression and anxiety are my big issues and I have to take meds for those.  Unfortunately the ADHD meds did nothing for those issues.  It great to hear that things are working for you."
biology,fe34bp8,t3_enopgk,1578845822.0,Biologists use slime mold in a lot of work.  I spoke with one at the University of Toronto and his focus was trying to understand how differentiation occurs when they send up fruiting bodies.  Seemed quite  interesting.  I went on to get a Ph.D. in Limnology (the study of inland waters) which really grabbed my interest.  Good luck with your quest.
ADHD,fe2yhjx,t3_enns7x,1578844245.0,Congratulations!!  That's a great achievement.
ADHD,fdzkrk6,t1_fdzdvta,1578791157.0,Absolutely!!
depression,fdzgh7s,t3_enfyh1,1578789980.0,"I have depression and anxiety too.  They colour absolutely everything.  And ""Mindful""l is right.  It's distorted thinking that gets us and it's hard.  I've been through all sorts of treatment (drugs and therapy) with some work it is possible to get out of the depression and get the anxiety under control.  Just hang in there."
ADHD,fdzc4p0,t3_enfjxp,1578788693.0,That's great.  It feels great when things work out.  Like you I was diagnosed when in my 40's.  Got medicated and finished my Ph.D. in my 50s.  Good for you.
ect,fda9iri,t3_ekbejj,1578243289.0,Nothing. But I'm in Canada.
ect,fda1ue6,t3_eke2hc,1578240755.0,"I had a round of 12 while completing my Ph.D. (which was successful ect and the Ph.D.).  Now I do ""maintenance"" ect.  It has worked and I'm now down to once every 6 weeks.  It is my hope to get it down to once every couple of months.  The memory issue you'r facing is real, so what about holding off further ect until you've finished the program you're in at school?"
osx,fcuhcfg,t3_eizvck,1577980976.0,"Interesting.  I've ""upgraded"" without a problem.  The systems run fine (2 2014 mac book pro's and 1 mac mini (2014)).  But then I'm just running ""standard"" apps and a couple of photo editing packages."
depressionregimens,f9rbtuf,t1_f9qzc5r,1575574125.0,"I've actually been thinking about trying TMS also.  I really don't like ECT, but for now, I guess I'll continue."
