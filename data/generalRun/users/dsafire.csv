CanadianCannabisLPs,fdakmyh,t3_ek9qy2,1578247105.0,"Well, DUH, they only just legalised it. Social change of attitudes like this take DECADES to happen. Look at The Civil Rights movement, we're still fighting that fight. The US still hasnt ratified The Equal Rights Amendment.   


People, change doesnt happen like a lightswitch, you have to CONVINCE people to change."
canada,fdajvx5,t1_fdagr0c,1578246886.0,"Torture, rape and genocide? Canadian values right there. 

Ask the Haudenosaunee about that. Or any other native group."
canada,fdajhoy,t3_ekeitd,1578246770.0,I worry about this fueling the already out of control Canadian racism and heterosexualisim. It could whip up violence towards Canadian citizens and refugees who have Asian features.
raisedbynarcissists,fdai8se,t1_fda2haq,1578246414.0,"Im glad.  You may think you're causing more harm, but in reality you are protecting vulnerable relations (who may still trust that person) from your abuser. Keep that in mind."
CanadaPolitics,fd4nocq,t1_fd3krte,1578169217.0,So youre saying Canadians are too stupid to come up with a happy medium.
CanadaPolitics,fd4nggf,t1_fd4hxpg,1578169136.0,"Yep, because full on black and white are the only choices here.   


Are you saying Canadians are too stupid to find a happy medium?"
CanadaPolitics,fd4mfsp,t1_fd3qgk1,1578168879.0,">The combined population of the Niagara/Hamilton/London/Waterloo/Halton regions definitely overshadows that of the Ottawa region and within a decade or so will easily rival the population of Montreal.

Which is why it's so DUMB that there isnt a ferry system on the bloody damned LAKE. Whole goddamn huge lake here that nobody will use for commuter traffic."
CanadaPolitics,fd4lnnw,t1_fd3bymg,1578168710.0,People commuting from Hamilton to Toronto are already experiencing this.
canada,fd4kmcu,t1_fd3aiyq,1578168421.0,"I think in Hamilton ON they let the Bus Lane experiment run for five months.   


It worked great if you wanted it to make the buses faster than the cars. Whihc is the point. However, the fact that a single driver in a 6 passinger SUV was regularly being passed by the bus completely made these people batshit insane with Privilege, and they demanded it be stopped.   


Poor people on the bus do not get to be faster than my hummer, EVER. seems to have been the consensus of Morons. Very #Hamont"
canada,fd4jmug,t3_ejwp0d,1578168116.0,They will in Hamilton.  No choice now.

See ya on the train LOL"
CanadaPolitics,fckwy3s,t1_fcklq4t,1577734968.0,"Its happening in Hamilton, due to the Ford rug pull on transit, and the Toronto housing market has got to be being effected. Hell, they're what drove this housing market insane in the first place. 

And with the current collapse of municipal government here?  Even longtime Boosters are talking about hitting the road, nevermind the TO Transplant club. The housing market here is likely to plunge like a twentysomething bungee jumping in front of the cheerleaders once they decide on a new target to gentrify. Maybe Burlington, they've wanted to be TO for decades apparently."
offmychest,fckvc7q,t1_fc7nviq,1577733987.0,"Theyt wont let me have real therapy here in Canada. They tell me i can have Online CBT training, but thats it. Not enough doctors and im not a priority, despite multiple police calls for suicidal gestures. 

Back home in NYC I once called 9 different shrinks offices and was refused by all because HMOs suck at paying. 

Ive pretty much given up on help ever arriving and have gone full shut-in. I havent left my apartment (except for 1 MD visit and a hospital stay) in about three years. 

Nobody cares."

He'll either get the point and stop being a dick or he'll be pissed off and fuck the hell off."
worldnews,fc6o4ny,t1_fc6hbdo,1577485232.0,"At the end of the day, most Yanks just want to be left to watch sportsball in peace, so they dont start shooting.  The day the NFL or AB InBev collapses, look out.  Its the same beer and circuses game.

Some days I think fear of  change is the only thing preventing a civil war in most English speaking nations. I cant speak for the others, as I only read in english.  


Edit: I dont know how long they'd put up with the volunteer firefighting up in Montana or in Texas though. That could be enough, if people start to feel the pinch."

Im triggering myself."

I have CPTSD. My abuser is always just out of the room. Always. When she's \*dead\* she'll be just on the other side of that door, coming back any second, and going to \*get me\*.   


Some shit just cant be undone. 

This is why I smoke weed all day. By prescription."
Hamilton,fc6i7vm,t1_fc6fbh0,1577481183.0,"Because HPD holds Hamiltonians in utter contempt?   


Thats what Im seeing. And considering the content, i can almost sympathize. Calling 911 because your tv is broken? Really? What an ass."
Hamilton,fbvfgn6,t1_fbv8riu,1577130041.0,id bet any amount that the roach problem is caused by the farmers market and Nations is just having trouble keeping them out.
