Cringetopia,ffjph20,t3_ett654,1580003676.0,I hate you guys between These stupid posts and my insomnia I went into the black hole trying to figure out what he did
unpopularopinion,ffjpdzq,t3_etwabm,1580003616.0,I agreed with you until the raw onion part. I need to sautée it a little bit. Not too much. Just to take the bitter taste out and make it sweet. But onions are bomb
relationships,ffjb0e2,t3_ettd0r,1579994525.0,"You sound a lot like how i used to be. so if you start dating a guy and he’s not initiating anything. Avoiding anything like what you describe. Stop dating him. Seriously idc how much you like him. He’s not the one for you and move on. It sucks but it’s the only way you’ll find a good guy for you

It’s cringey to look back and see how desperate I was. I finally met/married a guy who actually puts in the effort. You know how I found him? Not doing a god damn thing. I know it sounds counter productive for people like us. But that’s the only way you’ll find what you’re looking for. I should note def still put in effort once he puts in the initial effort. It should always be even! Good luck!"

AskWomen,ffiiwc6,t3_etn8am,1579974946.0,"I’ve been told by a lot of people they thought I was a B when they first met me, didn’t like me etc. when I’ve asked why. They said I seem uninterested not giving them the time of day. 

This was mainly work scenarios. But when I’m focused, and confident about my work I don’t mess around. It’s super annoying that people don’t actually want to talk to me until I approach them. They are shocked on how upbeat and talkative I am. That’s why I make it a point when I meet a female with this similar personality I go out of my way to talk to them. We end up having a lot in common and they’re the sweetest people"
AskWomen,ffhmh8h,t3_etmoz8,1579942354.0,"The biggest thing. Don’t act on it

I’m married but my husband and I were physically separated for 7 months (we were both military). Well I noticed I started to develop a crush on my friend. 
  We talked a lot more as it was easier. The biggest thing i realized is my  friend and my husband are extremely similar. And I was probably trying to get the affection I so desperately craved. I think my friend knew I had a crush on him too but we both respected my marriage and I didn’t nor will I ever cheat on my husband. 

I didnt tell my husband though. I think it would’ve made things worse as we were distant. But I’m glad I didn’t because the second we were together again. Crush went away completely."
Tucson,ffhg6ne,t1_ff9uobj,1579933862.0,No! It’s madness!
DoesAnybodyElse,ffhepxd,t1_ffhegtk,1579932182.0,"I know the feeling all too well. A helpful suggestion would be remember what gets you out of that place. It could be a person, music, a tv show, nap; a variety of things. And any time you feel that way rinse and repeat. Over time you will notice you get to the place less often. Hope it helps."
unpopularopinion,ffh5ovk,t3_ef5ggg,1579923817.0,I agree with the intermission because I need a pee break. Especially if I just came from dinner after a couple glasses of wine. My bladder is screaming after an hour

unpopularopinion,fffrtuf,t3_etaz6z,1579890421.0,"My last platoon in the army was a tight knit group of enlisted and officers. Age range 19-38. And every other week for PT (physical training) we’d play tag, red rover, red light/Greenlight etc. it was one of my fonder moments in the military. And hell it was great excercise."
unpopularopinion,fffmrro,t1_fffjq7i,1579887317.0,Yes because that makes sense. How dare I use a specific word to refer to my gender.
offmychest,fffgi32,t3_et5tt3,1579883452.0,"I think if I had a friend that did this, my only concern would be her safety. But if it’s a decent enough place and you feel safe than do you"
unpopularopinion,fff9fc4,t3_et9m99,1579878972.0,"As a female I completely agree for men as well. I don’t really care if he has a six pack or if he’s 6ft. What I care about is, does he have a kissable face? Bodies come and go with age/hormones fitness. Faces are pretty much concrete other than a wrinkle here and there"
tricare,ffev3lu,t3_eaan7b,1579866834.0,I was just about to post something like this. I have about a year and half wirth of back pain. I also want to know if I can. And where to go. Following.
ChoosingBeggars,ffeuz62,t3_esxyp7,1579866687.0,"Ok I don’t know the scenario BUT in a lot of universities tutors work for the professors for free school/credits and they offer free tutors to more of the beginners. I had a German exchange student help me with my german. It was one of her many jobs.

This guys seems like an ass but maybe there was a miscommunication?"
DoesAnybodyElse,ffeuurb,t3_et4re5,1579866538.0,"I used to a lot. When my depression was at its highest. I’ve def been improving. I found that when I have people and things to look fwd to, I’ve realized I do not want to die and I’m actually scared of death. 5 years ago I would have told you the opposite"
niceguys,ffeucjv,t1_ffeu3qm,1579865906.0,Oh god I don’t miss that at all. They did the same thing to me once. Ended up chopping all my hair to a pixie until I got out to not deal with the BS anymore
niceguys,ffetxtm,t1_ffetq3t,1579865375.0,Ah ok. I was in the army for a few years. (F) If our nails went slightly above our fingers they would freak the f out. I’m jelly
relationship_advice,ffebco9,t3_esxyqc,1579842028.0,I say tell her bluntly. If she doesn’t change after you were honest with her. Hit the road

CatsInSinks,ffcdwl3,t1_ffc58pa,1579797362.0,I second this comment. My cat loved sinks. Finally got him a fountain. Barkey makes me turn on the Sinn anymore.
LifeProTips,ffbm0vy,t3_esnlpg,1579771980.0,Is this to the same degree of: if you’re not going to buy it NOW then you font need it? Because I sometimes don’t necessarily need thing thing at the moment. But it’s it’s a awesome deal I just stock up. Otherwise I totally agree
ChoosingBeggars,ffblwh8,t3_esmtmg,1579771791.0,This is why I will never live on base if I can help it. I’m a vet but current spouse. And holy crap the stories I’d hear. Now we live 30min outside of base. Couldn’t be happier!

Outlander,ffar5y7,t1_ffak52g,1579742566.0,This exactly how I feel as well!
Outlander,ffaqswy,t1_ffakdfc,1579742321.0,"I guess I can’t understand people liking a repetitive scene. I don’t care about sex, it’s more of the fact that it’s boring. Plus I’m just agreeing with OP"
Outlander,ffaifr1,t3_esh9rg,1579736488.0,"I didn’t mind them in the beginning of the show. Ie season 1. But it’s starting to get cringey. Like I get it you’re in love. Not just Claire and Jamie’s. But every other character as well. Why can the just fade out at this point, we know what’s going to happen. To me it’s numbed me and it’s no longer enjoyable."
TownshipGame,ffahryn,t3_eshshr,1579736041.0,The snowboarding game I really liked. Pretty much any game that you can play after a certain time instead having to use resources. I do however like the transport magnate or what lever it’s called. Easy way to make cash for what i do already
AskReddit,ff68lck,t3_ero8mj,1579621689.0,Oh wow I did turn out attractive!
Outlander,ff6893y,t1_ff67gt5,1579621464.0,True I didn’t think about that. But that’s how I watched GOT. Thanks:)
unpopularopinion,ff66qre,t3_errnfk,1579620463.0,My SO and I never had a wedding.  Never saw the point. We wanted a house instead. But we did say we should have big party on our 10yr or something.  Always seemed more meaningful than weddings. Back in the day weddings made sense.  (Family trading etc.) Now they seem kinda silly to me
TownshipGame,ff4o51k,t3_erl5gu,1579568359.0,It’s so annoying. These mini games are becoming super annoying to collect for too. At least the snowboard game would refill after a certain time
offmychest,ff4ezke,t3_erhisj,1579562024.0,"I’ve never understood it myself. Be single and hook up with anyone you want , don’t drag another person in your messes. I’ve been married for 2 years and we’ve already discussed if we were ever to come to that point we should just get a divorce. Although I don’t foresee this happening"

unpopularopinion,ff0whv7,t3_eqvjgp,1579472939.0,I like it. To me it’s the same concept of soda without the sugar. I used to hate it. Then I lived in Germany. Was forced to drink it at times learned to love it. Now anytime I have a soda craving i drink it. Soda craving gone
