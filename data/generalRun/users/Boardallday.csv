gifs,ffif8hv,t3_ets8tr,1579972449.0,"I'm pretty sure I've seen cats use their power over mice as their swag before. I feed a stray mama cat and her husband in NYC. I've seen the male cat catch a mouse and bring it to the female like it was a trophy before giving the half dead mouse to the female for her to finish off and eat. Also seen the female catch a mouse and bring it to the male cat in the same way. I was surprised to see them cooperate this way, but I do feed them twice a day so they're not that hungry and I guess it makes sense."
DiWHY,ffie08v,t1_ffid0x2,1579971616.0,"Digital media is TRASH compared to crisp analog VHS tapes when the tracking is adjusted correctly and the heads and tapes are cleaned and brand new. Literally no experience in this world compares to watching an original VHS release of a great family VHS movie. HD resolutions just counts pixels, they can't account for the 1440p resolution of wholesome family entertainment."

>Often considered an important medium of film history, the influence of VHS on art and cinema was highlighted in a retrospective staged at the Museum of Arts and Design in 2013.[64][65][66][67] In 2015, the Yale University Library collected nearly 3,000 horror and exploitation movies on VHS tapes, distributed from 1978 to 1985, calling them ""the cultural id of an era.""[68][69][70][71]"

I had an abscess on my arm in 2016 and came in at 4am high as a kite. They gave me morphine and lanced and drained it and put me on IV vancomycin for a few days. They gave me slushies and those buffalo chicken rollers, and then I just went home."
DiWHY,ffi73t8,t1_ffi6jmn,1579966826.0,Yeah I'm gonna have to trust a film and VHS expert like Gregg on this one.
DiWHY,ffi6o56,t1_ffi6fc4,1579966506.0,"Well you may be correct that the individual tapes aren't very valuable, but the Victorville Film Archives were a world renowned movie collection of respected film buff and movie critic Gregg Turkington. It was a collection housed in two storage units in Victorville, California, and was thought to be the largest collection of movies on VHS tape format in the world before they were burnt to the ground."
DiWHY,ffi6bqv,t1_ffhi0gv,1579966253.0,VHS tapes are exceedingly rare these days and extremely valuable. This shelf would have been a welcome addition to the Victorville Film Archives.
