NintendoSwitch,ffk23v6,t1_ffk18f3,1580013453.0,"I've been using the Insignia dock in my office on lunch a couple of times per week for twoish years and haven't had a problem.

I also have the Skull and Co dock. I have used often while traveling without issues and love how small the ""core"" part is. It stays in my Switch case.

Personally, I'd pay the extra money for the Skull and Co one but I can't speak for it's long term reliability like I can the Insignia one.

Edit: Skull and Co not Skull Candy!"
wholesomememes,feyfisq,t1_feyaptg,1579444816.0,"No, we just repair any damage from storage and build the new one. It takes us 2-3 nights of building for the regular size ones and 3-4 nights for the larger ones. We have talked about disassembling one of the old ones to rebuild along with the new one but haven't done it yet."
wholesomememes,fewvpir,t1_fewnwp7,1579420226.0,My wife and I buy one of those Lego Creator Expert buildings every year and use them as a Christmas Village. No shame buying a Lego set for yourself every once in awhile!

shrimptank,fe44372,t1_fe3cm7x,1578855628.0,"I peeled it before blanching, left it in over night, then removed it in the morning. It's only a 12 gallon tank so maybe overnight was too long."
shrimptank,fdzzvux,t1_fdzz4kn,1578799731.0,Thank you for the info! I just put some almond leaves in mine. I had a bunch of shrimp die off after blanched organic zucchini a few weeks so I've been terrified of veggies ha! I'm not sure if it was coincidence or not but I'll probably test veggies again at some point.
shrimptank,fdzx5bz,t3_engxos,1578797948.0,Congrats!  I have a berried shrimp that will hopefully produce some little guys in a week or so.  Are you doing anything special food wise?

Stadia,fcw479h,t3_ehj8fq,1578016758.0,"I tried this out a few days ago on a Pixel 3. Using a wired connection, the controller seemed to work properly except for the right thumbstick. It was painfully slow even with sensitivity turned all the way up. 

Did you hook your Pro Controller up via Bluetooth or wired to your PC?"
Stadia,fcltmr2,t3_ehvnao,1577756173.0,I got the code and just got signed up. Thank you so much for your generosity!
