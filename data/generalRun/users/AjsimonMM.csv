Fixing it like you said makes it enjoyable till the last noodle!  I tried it with regular chicken flavor last night, going to get some roasted chicken like you recommended tonight.  Thank you for this!!!

Edit: Sorry for any errors in the text, I'm typing fast because I'm at work."

""You know the problem with the internet is, if you fuck a sheep and are feeling regretful about it, go online and you will find a whole sheep fucking community"""
mash,fdc0z0m,t1_fdb3vnr,1578264993.0,This is the perfect answer.  I've always thought the show changed after the third season.  I remember hearing that Trapper left the show because the writers were getting too far away from the plot of the book and/or movie.  Thank you very much for the great explanation!

lostredditors,fda4sb9,t3_ekc94u,1578241665.0,I too have three low hanging onions testicles in the summer.  Maybe that's why women always cry when performing fellatio on me.
mash,fd7depk,t1_fd76xkq,1578202734.0,"It's true.  I guess it just reflects that there's no way of manipulating or changing what happens in war.  Kids are going to die.  Just like Blake said, ""There are certain rules about a war. And rule number one is young men die. And rule number two is, doctors can't change rule number one."""
mash,fd7cty7,t1_fd6xvqo,1578202492.0,"That's true.  In the early seasons, they tried to keep the show light-hearted and funny.  I doubt the writers would've made a show back then that was deep or emotional like nurse's eulogy episode.  They really moved away from the theme of the original movie after BJ replaced Trapper."

I noticed that the number was there shortly after posting it, but I rarely visit that store, and it's not really near my house.  So I decided it's not that big of a deal.  Happy New Year to you."
