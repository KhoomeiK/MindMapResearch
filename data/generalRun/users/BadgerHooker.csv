Most places require a 30 day eviction notice, and THEN if they stay longer, you get to start the court process to get them out. OP would have better luck offering to move her out to her own apartment and pay for 3 months rent in advance, directly to the office.

Part of me wants to be petty and just overly agree with every single thing he says exaggeratedly. ""OH YES! Cousin has the most beautiful babies. I simply cannot compete with that type of perfection. I will sadly forfeit this one competition and hang my head in shame. Woe is me!"" 

And cousin ""Oh, I know my cousin is going to be making so much more money because she is so smart and has such a great work ethic! I will still try my best in my own work, but will forever be proud of my successful cousin!"".

AmItheAsshole,fdxkiyq,t1_fdxil6z,1578769757.0,"I was raised similarly. My father would usually set overly harsh punishments and never said sorry to anyone because he couldnít be perceived as being fallible. I would have had so much more respect for him if he had shown an ounce of compassion or mercy even once. I absolutely agree that boundaries should be adhered to, and punishments are lessons in themselves. I donít think it would be right for the parents to tell her to apologize because that would be forced. Punishment isnít always so black and white, and sometimes being shown mercy can also be a lesson. Talking about it as a family is vital, so they are all on the same page."

AmItheAsshole,fdxgu2g,t1_fdx9n01,1578768562.0,"She is already on restriction now, so if she starts therapy and makes some actual progress and feels genuine regret and tries to make amends, it wouldnít necessarily negate the restrictions she had imposed. It would essentially be like getting time off for good behavior. The idea is also contingent upon her not knowing that would be the reward. Her parents seem to be torn because they know she needs a suitable punishment, but are aware that she will only ever have one senior prom. Think of it like an act of mercy but only if she makes real genuine progress and apologizes. If she made a huge effort for the right reason and showed personal growth, I donít think she would automatically forget what she learned. I dunno, maybe Iíve watched too many ìflawed hero makes a sacrifice in the endî type movies."

Itís not uncommon to have to switch medications because of negative side effects. Take care of yourself, man. New moms are always told to practice self-care so they donít burnout, it would be wise for you to take a little time for yourself when you can. In 10 years, you wonít be looking back at remembering how nice and tidy your house was. There will always be endless chores that can be done, so donít get into the habit of expecting perfection. Families with new babies are practically supposed to be a little messy and tired. The best you can hope for is to list your priorities and do what you can."

AmItheAsshole,fdwg3gy,t1_fdwdn38,1578758302.0,True. I have gotten sucked down the rabbit hole reading about head injuries and the effects they can have on personality and behavior.

This is not a one-off though, as OP stated itís been 2 years of this kind of behavior. If this pattern of behavior continues into adulthood, which is less than 2 years away as she is a senior, then yeah, she very likely COULD be ON HER WAY to being a sociopath. 

Not really sure what you are insinuating I am compensating for.. I am pretty damn aware of my flaws and my lady-penis is HUGE, so..

You have my permission to pity her, because I can guarantee you that she is miserable every single day of her life. You, on the other hand, have amazing instincts!
