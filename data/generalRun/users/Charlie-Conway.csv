television,ffekiko,t1_ffczcsm,1579851852.0,"Yeah, given it's setting and time period... Midwest kids in the 70s.. College wasn't quite the expectation it's become these days. So it makes sense most of the cast would've probably stuck around point place working blue collar jobs. Hell, even Kelso becoming a cop wasn't that much of a stretch to believe. But Donna should've gone to college. Her character was always heading in that direction right up until it became inconvenient for the shows longevity.

It's just silly that four years after graduating high school they're all still hanging around the Foreman's house even after Eric moved away entirely."
hiphopheads,ffej838,t1_ffdiz1d,1579850240.0,"Yep. Most kids shows don't hold up when you revisit them as an adult. The only kids show from my era of Nickelodeon in the 90s that I've found actually holds up for more than pure nostalgia is The Adventures of Pete & Pete.

The writing was surprisingly good but in truth most of the appeal of watching it now that I'm old enough to be a parent myself was spotting the insane cameos they peppered in throughout the shows run.

For example, as a kid I didn't know who Iggy Pop was... So I definitely wasn't able to appreciate the irony of casting one of the godfathers of punk to play an incredibly over protective suburban father."

television,ffc2jir,t3_esrzc8,1579789932.0,"The show was a victim of it's own success. As far as the show's story is concerned there was no reason to keep going after they graduated from high school at the end of season 5. But it was still massively popular so they had to come up with an increasingly convoluted series of nonsense to keep all the characters hanging out in Red & Kitty's basement rather than actually moving on with their lives and becoming adults.

The show had plenty of funny episodes in the final 3 seasons of it's run but I'd point to the finale of season 5 and the premiere of season 6 as the line in the sand between the shows peak and it's steady decline until we reached the mess that was season 8."

Precedent isn't really a justification for length though. I'm going to flip the numbers here because the criticism isn't actually about an arbitrary number it's about the content within. 

You can release a 65 minute album that doesn't give up a single moment for you to notice the clock but you can also release a 35 minute album that feels excruciatingly long.

Yeah, spot on. I think there's a great deal of value in being able to understand and explain to others why you like or don't like media. But I get that not everybody wants to spend all that much time picking apart a piece of music especially when they didn't even like it in the first place.

But at the same time nobody wants to have a conversation with someone who defaults to ""it's just my opinion"" when they're asked a follow up to a super generic criticism. *Obviously* it's your opinion, nobody's challenging you on that, we just want to know what makes you feel ""X track/album"" was trash.

The real answer is that show ended almost 12 years ago and while it was airing it always skewed to an older demographic anyway. Just not as much of an overlap with redditors. I feel old as dirt saying this but it was probably a tv show a lot of redditors only know vaguely because their parents watched it.

Directions:

1. In a glass bowl, whisk together egg yolk and dry ingredients. Combine lemon juice and vinegar in a separate bowl then thoroughly whisk half into the yolk mixture. Start whisking briskly, then start adding the oil a few drops at a time until the liquid seems to thicken and lighten a bit, (which means you've got an emulsion on your hands). Once you reach that point you can relax your arm a little (but just a little) and increase the oil flow to a constant (albeit thin) stream. Once half of the oil is in add the rest of the lemon juice mixture.
