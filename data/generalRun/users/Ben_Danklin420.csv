SuicideWatch,ffhb0iy,t3_etkrq8,1579928403.0,"I really feel you, over the last couple years I’ve been feeling more and more scared and anxious, less and less social. To the point where I’m so disgusted with myself and unhappy because I sit around feeling awful and reap the benefits of my bad choices. So many nasty feelings rolled into one cocktail, it truly is a devastating combination for so many people, and I think this situation is a lot more common than people realize. The important thing is it’s not too late. Daydreaming is the only thing that allows us that slight slight sliver of hope, but we have to do something however small because until then we are just losing what could be the happiest days of our lives. I’m not saying it’s easy or even simple, but just starting small and reaching out can work unimaginable wonders. Your life is worth it, and that’s not just something to say to everyone who is having suicidal thoughts. Even just judging from your post, you’re a smart articulate person and everyone’s potential can be so so high if they just keep trying. Do it for you. Never stop searching for the truth is also important"
SuicideWatch,ff7o1kh,t1_ff7nln6,1579654165.0,"You have no idea how much I want to do that, but all jokes aside it’s not worth it. I also don’t mean to appear like I know everything, I really don’t, but I think that this is the right course of action. Especially since this is so important. I don’t want it to seem like all I’m saying is “stay strong”, because I know how aggravating that is to hear. I just think your life is to important no to fix. Hope you find the truth"
SuicideWatch,ff7nez3,t1_ff7lc2h,1579653724.0,"Not yet, but I’m still trying. I really wasn’t trying at all for a while, but I’m not giving up even though I want to."
SuicideWatch,ff7fhwi,t3_es1xdo,1579648351.0,"It’s definitely not easy that’s for sure. “Grow some balls” or “get over it” is terrible advice. It can be near impossible to visualize, but you can’t plan your life by using your current situation. Things change more than you could ever realize. I know you probably don’t want to hear this, nobody does, but getting better is a undeniably better solution than Suicide and it is possible. If you need someone to talk to I’m here"

SuicideWatch,fe6disd,t3_entayx,1578887740.0,"Hey sorry you probably haven’t gotten as many responses as you would’ve wanted, but do you want to talk? Please don’t do something drastic in the moment. I’m going to bed now but if you want message me in the morning"
SuicideWatch,fckmhwy,t3_ehmoac,1577728541.0,"I don’t know what you want to hear right now. I don’t have a magical solution to fix all your problems, but No one’s life is ever too far gone, or worthless. There is a change you can make, however small, today and everyday. Those changes add up. Please try to make a small positive change, make a post on the financial help subreddit, what have you got to lose? You don’t know what’s gonna happen if you kill yourself, ( not trying to get religious) but seriously no one knows for sure have you taken that into consideration? On a slightly darker but equally important note, I don’t know what stuff you bought, but do you know the actual chances you will die or just horribly painfully injure yourself. The lethality rates are a lot lower than you think. Please just consider other options for your future and the people you can affect in your future. You still have a lot of life left to live. If you need someone to talk to I’m here"
SuicideWatch,fcg4rnx,t3_eh59rn,1577636452.0,"I know it sucks, but these are Our lives we can’t just rely on other people to fix them. Stuff like that can lead to co dependency issues. I’m not saying to not rely on others, but at the end of the day everybody has their own lives they have to take care of. They can help you with yours, but that shouldn’t be expected. If you need someone to talk to further I’m always here"
