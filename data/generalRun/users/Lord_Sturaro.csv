Juve,fddsqc1,t1_fddrgqi,1578323012.0,"I dont know wtf Sarri did to Pjanic, he was really good player. Now he looks like he doesn't care anymore and doesnt want to touch the ball. It hurts me seeing him like this. Matuidi, hes an average player I saw this coming. It's fine, but Pjanic? He used to be a really important player, I feel like he wants leave or something. Maybe I'm just overreacting."
relationships,fda9ms7,t1_fda7z5h,1578243336.0,"She talks in a different angry sort of tone only towards me, and I've noticed that. I've always been that kind of a person who asks how everyone's doing. I listen to everyone's problems but she doesn't seem to like me. So that makes it unreasonable to have a talk with her."
relationships,fda5iqw,t1_fda3b5w,1578241966.0,"Wow you made my day slightly better. Since you know a lot, I kinda have a bit of a problem with girl in my class. Shes always mean to me ever since I was 10, and I've been literally scared to talk to her. Since I'm a weak person and very timid she takes advantage of it and says mean things to me. But now she friends with friend and I cant take it. Shes around me more now and I dont like it. I usually ignore people say mean things but today I was more assertive. She had a problem with me laughing out loud for a silly reason and I asked her what's her problem? I hate that I talked to her like even though she mocked me. 
What do you think? My friends tell me she has a bad past and I felt very bad for her. I still do, but shes horrible things to a lot of people. Now it feels like I'm her target. When 11 or 12, she used to come to my table and take my breakfast away without even asking me lol. Thank God that's over, but I thought she behaves like this because of a bad household.  Shes always been like this tho, from grade 5 to grade 10. Shes still the same, she hasn't changed one bit. Except she smokes now, and feels depressed. She also had her boyfriend cheat on her and that does make me feel bad for her. Shes bothering me a lot, what do I do? Sorry for the long message, thought you could be the right person I could ask help for."

relationships,fda04e7,t1_fd9zvs6,1578240151.0,"That makes sense. Thanks for your help, maybe I just need to trust my cousin on his decision."
relationships,fd9zk6k,t1_fd9ymn2,1578239939.0,"I know lol, it's so weird. I dont usually get angry, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to, anyways you seem like someone who knows about people better than me. You're probably right and I wont talk to him about it. I'm sure he knows what hes doing and I'm not doubting my cousin. :)"
relationships,fd9z2ms,t1_fd9yf6p,1578239759.0,"I told you I'd delete it. At the end of the day it's always his decision. I've no intention of even talking to him about it ffs. Good day, I enjoyed the argument. Never got so heated up before, I'm getting more assertive. Which is a good thing ig. You're clearly right and I'm sorry for even posting this :)"
relationships,fd9yf3v,t1_fd9wq28,1578239570.0,Oh yeah posting this totally means I want him to suffer and hes gonna totally see this. Hes such a moron for doing that to a nice girl. Wtf is wrong with you?
relationships,fd9xz7p,t1_fd9x9z8,1578239392.0,"Relax, I'll delete it. It's not like posting this helped anyway, because people is getting triggered at me when i didnt do anything to him. I haven't even talked to him for 2 years now wtf"
relationships,fd9x2n5,t1_fd9whhl,1578239020.0,Wdym if you're referring to me when you're saying I'm interfering his life I haven't even talked to him about it. Everyone let go off that whole marriage issue. He's on his own now.

relationships,fd9vtmg,t1_fd9uoyx,1578238689.0,"100% sure he's not gay. He likes girls. It's not too soon, he's 28. She's not someone who he has been friends with, she's someone who's looking to marry as well. She likes him a lot and I'm pretty sure he likes her too. I guess he just need to be happy with himself but this problem is bothering me a lot idk why :("

relationships,fd9ufgu,t1_fd9s95j,1578238188.0,"Of course not. I dont even think he'll take me seriously, I'm just a kid. What do I know? I really felt bad for him and for the girl. I asked my mom all about it, and I offered to help because it's very important problem and no one really supports him. I know I'm not an adult nor do I know much about this cousin of mine, but he clearly said he wanted to marry. I dont get why he changed his mind, I guess it has to do something with his low self worth."
relationships,fd9q17c,t1_fd9nona,1578236605.0,"Maybe you got a point. I really dont know how he feels, if only there was a way I could know ifs he happy or not. If he is, I think he's better off this way."
relationships,fd9pnk4,t1_fd9oxlw,1578236447.0,"Dude, all I'm doing is looking out for him. I dont care if I'm in a relationship or not, all I asked was for help. I thought you guys would've a better idea about this kind of problems than I do. But if only you guys would help me  instead of telling me to stop supporting and doing all that I can for my cousin."
relationships,fd9k6la,t1_fd9jrbr,1578234545.0,True. My family has been pushing him a lot. Maybe he needs to figure this out on his own. But I dont know how long he's gonna keep rejecting having a partner. Any idea how to approach him about giving therapy a try?
relationships,fd9jniv,t1_fd9iugz,1578234257.0,Maybe you're right but he definitely need someone to encourage and look after him if he goes to therapy. His mom is extremely sick and he lives far away from his family. Idk if he'll listen to me if I ask him to go to therapy.
Juve,fd3zh7a,t1_fcznj3x,1578162958.0,"I wholeheartedly agree. Not saying he's a bad player but rather we dont need him. Anyways, I wouldn't take him for 10m salary wtf."
