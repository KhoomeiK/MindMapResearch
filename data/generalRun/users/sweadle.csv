Good people are attracted to good people, love attracts love, happiness attracts happiness. 

But it also attracts people who hope that you will help them find what's lacking in their lives. In some relationships, one person is the flower and the other person is the watering can. If you're usually the watering can, practice just being a flower. And find someone else who is already living the life they want, and are happy for company along the way, not people who are unhappy and lost, and see that you have what they can't find for themselves.

I was recently talking to a friend (married, six kids, but married early 30's and her husband was in his 40's). When we were young (and religious) we were taught that adulthood is a mountain climb, and you have to choose the right partner who will help you along the way. 

So we wait at the bottom of the mountain with our packs and wait and wait and wait for someone who wants to climb the way we do. No good matches come by, and so some people just keep waiting (set up a nice camp, keep meeting people as they come by). 

The other option is to start climbing, and see who you encounter on the trail who already is climbing at your pace. It'll be a better match to just move ahead with the climb, figure out how to climb on your own, find people (groups and friends and solo climbers) to climb with for a bit, and eventually you'll find someone who's a good match. Not because you vetted them and you've both decided you want the same things, but because you're both already living the lives you want, and those lives are headed in the same direction. 

I was raised super religious (most of my friends got married between 18-22 and had a few kids by 30) and the idea of being single at 33 would have been AWFUL. The truth is, I see my friends struggling in marriages and with kids that they chose before they had any idea what kind of life they'd want, or what kind of things can go wrong. I am glad I know who I am, I know I am okay alone, I know how to fill my life with love without needing anyone to reciprocate. I am single right now (maybe? Just met someone a few weeks ago...) but I know I am living the life that will attract the kind of people I respect and want to share my life with. They're not all potential romantic partners, but at this point in my life I'm happy with good friends, mentors, children to love. 

I still get moments of panic every once in a while (What if I'm single forever? What if I enjoy being single too much and it means I'm never willing to compromise for a relationship?) but it usually passes if I share it with someone. 

Good luck! It's hard to be a recovering fundamentalist Christian whose entire world view is shaped by that one thing, and then rejoining life as an adult trying to reshape all those ideas."

I'd start with worrying about who you love, not finding someone to love you. Shelter dogs, friend's kids, the lonely on Christmas or Valentine's day. Fill your life with love, flowing outward. Use your therapist to make sure you're loving others with healthy boundaries, and loving yourself in the same way. 

Also look for a community that's not religious. The best way I've found a community was volunteering regularly with a group I really believed in. I was around people who had similar values and priorities as me, who believed into putting their values to work."

Child support: He needs to pay, always. It's not for you, it's for your child. He needs to pay even if he never sees his child, even if he gets married and has other children, even if you get married and have other children.

Custody: Whether he has paid child support or not, he has a right to see his child. Since he basically abandoned his child, he's not going to win full custody, but it takes a lot for a judge to rule that a parent can't see their kid at all. If he wants to see his kid, you need to let him. Go to court and get a custody agreement set. He'll get one weekend a month or every other weekend, and you'll get a break.

As others suggested, CPS can help. You need to get a referral for a complete psychiatric examination. You can literally just take your son to the ER and say he is threatening others. 

Prison didn't help him, a psychiatric facility did, and that is where the end game needs to be. If he goes to prison, he will get NO resources or support and be in a traumatic environment. He will probably end up doing something that will mean he will live the rest of his life in prison. 

This is such an impossible, awful situation for any parent to be in. However, you are in a good position in that he isn't in prison yet, and he's done clear enough things that it's clear he needs help. Since he is a minor, you have a lot of power still.

It can be frustrating for anyone to read above your reading level. The way to improve your reading level is to read right at the level you are at. If you are too far ahead, it tends to just discourage people and they don't have enough context to figure things out. If you read at a 9th grade level, and I hand you a book written at 11th grade level, you won't learn to read at the 11th grade level, you'll just stall out and get frustrated. The solution is to read books written at a 9th grade level until they seem too easy, and then you move up to 10 grade level.

So it may be that you're reading books a bit too advanced for you now. I'd see if you enjoy some Young Adult books, especially the classics which tend to be pretty timeless stories but written at maybe a 9th or 10th grade level, not 12th. 

Most newspapers are written at 10th or 11th grade level, because beyond that people tune out. Just because you finished high school doesn't mean you read beyond a 12th grade level, in fact most people don't. 

You can google what books are written at what level. I'd suggest starting with a book that's 9th grade level. Does it seem too basic, or does it allow you to really lose yourself in the story because you're not working to figure out something every sentence? You're looking for that sweet spot of not being bored by something over simple, but it not being so hard that it pulls you out of the story. This will also help you become a faster reader because you'll be able to read at a good pace. 

There is NOTHING wrong with being at a lower level of reading. In fact, I wish more people paid attention to if they are reading things beyond their reading level, because I think it frustrates people and discourages them from reading. It would be like if you were learning to play the guitar, but you were only allowed to play songs with chords you hadn't learned yet. It would be needlessly difficult and frustrating. It doesn't make you a better musician, what you need is to go back and learn some more basics and work up to that level. 

I love, love, love reading and I feel the same way you do when I read a book I am not understanding. It's not a good feeling. But clearly you WANT to be a reader, you're just struggling how to get books that are the right fit."

Listen, anytime someone has died their presence is SO felt at a wedding, be it a parent, a sibling, but especially a former spouse. I have heard a lot of people say they don't want to ruin the happiness of a day with acknowledgement of that person, but for hte people who experienced the loss they are carrying that loss with them the WHOLE day. Getting to acknowledge it publicly is a huge comfort. 

If you wanted the day to be about you and your fiance, you need to marry someone without this baggage. This day IS about closing the door on that family and opening a door to a new family. She will be there with you. The sentiment is really beautiful. Your step daughter is acknowledging the beauty of what she lost and wishing it for you. 

Unless you can immediately see how this is a huge issue, and see it as a beautiful welcome into her family, not a jab (I can't even see how you get there) then you have NO business marrying a widower and being a step mother to his child. 

This won't be the last time a happy moment causes them to bring her. Unless you can allow room for their feelings in those moments, you need to end the relationship."
