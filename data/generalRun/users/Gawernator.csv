Instagramreality,ff5vp87,t3_ermt6b,1579611853.0,Lol and her TikTok and instagram also claim she has no surgeries done and it’s all genetics. How can people fall for this stuff!

Road racing is very physical as well, full body workout just about. Heart rates peaking in the 180’s.  Imagine throwing around 400 lbs nonstop for 30 minutes. G forces are crazy. It’s not anything like street riding where you just chill in a straight line."

Hinge seems to work great still and a few others, Tinder isn't even worth using IMO anymore.  Tons of matches and plenty of replies back for me or even girls messaging first about 20% of the time.

fatlogic,ff21k4u,t1_ff0at5u,1579491317.0,Men burn more calories because of higher mass but also are much more likely to have outdoor/active jobs too.
fatlogic,ff21gqb,t1_ff09vda,1579491246.0,Lol that was me in the military. Some people burn a ton of calories just from day to day life and not realize it. I eat like a pig when I visit Colombia but don’t gain weight because I walk everywhere.
fatlogic,ff201rc,t3_eqvvrb,1579490218.0,"Sounds about right. If you strictly track your diet and TDEE for a few days you’ll really see how easy it is to take in tons of excess calories, especially on American diets"
sarmsourcetalk,ff1ztq2,t3_er57i7,1579490056.0,"If you’re a healthy male you’re wasting time and money taking a PCT. I just finished 8 weeks at 10mg and within 1.5 weeks already feel mostly rebounded.  There’s a lot of FUD from people acting like a SARM has the same effect as anabolic steroids when they don’t. If you’re going to run PCT’s you might as well use actual steroids. Lol

sarmssourcetalk,feihecl,t1_feigzb1,1579138586.0,"I’ve done 2 or 3 LGD cycles and one RAD-140 cycle. Obviously there is suppression but I was back to normal within a week of finishing the cycle generally. You should not need a PCT UNLESS you are still having suppression symptoms after 4ish weeks of finishing the cycle. Otherwise you’re wasting your money and delaying your recovery time. It’s not an anabolic steroid, not sure why some people are crazy about taking a PCT as if they were using steroids. The drugs work in a different way

Edit: also LGD is a pretty mild compound overall. My side effects were mainly slightly increased sex drive and slightly increased acne. It helped improve my lifts but the main benefit I noticed was endurance for exercise. It’s not going to make you crazy big like some anabolic steroids. But it does work. Just don’t take some crazy dose, I would see how you react at 5mg and if you’re fine just go to 10mg and stay there

And most my cycles were 8 weeks.

bayarea,fehnlka,t1_fehnbj5,1579120182.0,"That’s terrible. The sad truth is that motorcycling is dangerous in the US, especially California. The biggest problem is the huge sea of really bad drivers.
