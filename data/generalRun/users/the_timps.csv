I'll paint/draw/paste/whatever something entirely different on a layer if I plan to use lighten or screen or multiply and so on to add or remove shadows, make fabric look dry, wet etc."
photoshop,ff5gqt0,t1_ff5fvc1,1579592145.0,">Why Googling when you can just try what those do?

Because you have zero control.

Randomly trying blend modes on a layer tells you how you can make THIS layer look.  
But most professional Photoshop work is chasing a specific result.  
You need to know what the blend mode does to paint the right thing onto to the one you're blending."

No, they don't.

He's working for them in some capacity. He's in their building.  
He could have overheard meetings, seen diagrams on a whiteboard, seen printouts, been accidentally or deliberately forwarded an email.

They don't need to prove anything huge at all. There's more than enough circumstantial evidence to make this a huge problem for them. They need to speak with a lawyer or two immediately and start damage control."

He started the show literally too terrified to speak to women and ended it hitting on a celebrity and asking for a date. He didn't need to end up married like everyone else, they were all on their own journeys.
