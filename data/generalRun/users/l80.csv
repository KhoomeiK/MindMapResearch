/u/Teagoblet, the fact that you have so many people who support you and care about you and have acclimated to this means that you have a wonderful support network. Please do not be embarrassed for processing trauma in the way that you did and have. Being able to deal with that kind of assault and have such a clear understanding of your coping process, and knowing what is right and best for you is incredible. You should be *proud* of doing so much work to process that kind of trauma and come through on the other side. No one asks for this shit or deserves it, but being strong enough and brave enough to work through it is on another level altogether."

All due respect, but boofuckityhoo. You're his *wife* and the mother of his soon-to-be-born child. This isn't even a contest. Your well being and happiness comes first.

He sounds like an asshole.

> When I went through my burn out last year my husband really defended me, stood up for me, without me even having to ask. 

That's an incredibly low bar, hon. Of course you shouldn't have to ask your *husband* to stand up for you to his asshole family.

> And I understand that because it took me years to stand up to my parents and it’s just something my husband struggles with. And if he respects my issues, I have to respect his.

That's not how it works. You don't have to put up with asshole behavior because your husband looks vaguely constipated when it happens. You get to opt right the fuck out of dealing with assholes who can't be respectful of you, your boundaries, or your wishes for your unborn child. 

Your husband is welcome to deal with your FIL on his own time. But you don't have to put up with it. You don't have to turn it into some kind of dramatic ultimatum, either. Just... don't host them. Don't go out to events with them. Do not visit them. Your husband is still welcome to see them as he sees fit provided it is not detracting from designated time you spend together, or his responsibilities as a partner / father.

> We will defend that little soul in every way possible.

You know the most effective way to defend a child from an abusive asshole? You don't expose your baby to abusive assholes. 

> I’ll try to have a little chat with my MIL (the ex of FIL) to see if she can give me some pointers to deal with FIL’s attitude.

This isn't your responsibility to fix. You're about to consult your MIL for how to get around the [missing stair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_stair), but none of you are calling this out for what it is."

This is a really difficult situation to be in, and the likelihood of the CEO actually resolving this is slim to none (but gosh, I would be amped if he did! Sometimes there are people who see bullshit for what it is and put a stop to it).

Check out the EEOC website - you can file a claim online. It's a great way to get a good idea of what represents an issue and what you should report. I don't know that there's anything to do *right now*, but you seem like a ducks in a row kinda person, and this is one thing to get in a row today. I'd also recommend printing out your email correspondence and keeping a record juuuust in case anything should happen when you go out on leave."

That's really the only question that matters. You know what you're in for - you're going to be uncomfortable and tired, the majority of guests are going to be drunk (possibly including your husband), and it's 2 hours in the car round trip. You can ask your husband not to drink, you can hang out and watch people toss hatchets around - if you *want* to do that, go for it.

Ultimately, it doesn't matter what anyone else here thinks. You have full permission to decide what works or doesn't work for you."

> I just don’t understand where she’s coming from!

I think you already nailed it - baby rabies and jealousy of your family's proximity, so she's throwing a fit to make sure she gets ""first dibs"" never mind how that might sour her relationship with you.

Which is incredibly shitty and childish behavior. Since your relationship is generally pretty good, I'd give her a chance to calm down and act like a reasonable adult again. If she's doubling down on this behavior, just shut it down. If she's crying/tantruming:

""I can hear you're upset. Let's chat later once you've calmed down.""

If she's yelling / screaming at you:

""The way you are speaking to me is unacceptable. We can talk about this again later when you can speak to me civilly.""

Basically, you're giving her a chance to get it together, but not putting up with or caving to her unreasonable demands / behavior. It's crappy she's dumping all of this on you, and it's totally unfair. I hope your husband is stepping up to handle most of her nonsense."

Exactly. Because the flip side of this is that all attention is inherently unwelcome, because their father is the arbiter of their sexuality. So presumably as they get older and actually *want* to have sex with someone, this fucko is going to be menacing any prospective partners with his gun because only he gets to decide who gets to fuck his daughters and when. They have no agency."
