I don't look in a mirror unless I'm trying something new and want to make sure my form is correct while I'm getting used to it"
rant,fg0e8b6,t1_fg0ct2g,1580405951.0,"So that's also why I get extremely pissed off when people go to the local state park that has ""ALL DOGS MUST BE ON 6' LEASH"" signs and then just let their dogs off leash. There are hiking trails that go very deep into the woods. I've been a mile into the woods when a golden retriever would come bouncing out of nowhere and scare the shit out of my leashed dog. Leashed dog + unleashed dog is a BAD idea bc a leashed dog will immediately get defensive and feel trapped. People are so fucking stupid it's a wonder they don't get hurt by their own dogs more. And yes, I love all dogs, but I have no problem defending myself against a loose dog that can easily hurt mine"
rant,fg0dsmv,t1_fg0ct2g,1580405688.0,"Oh yeah there is a house about a mile up my (very rural) dirt road that used to have a loose GSD that would stalk and chase people. Their shithead kids would sit in their front yard and egg the dog on. A bunch of my neighbors had maced the dog before and I always carried mace when I walked my dog. 


The ONE DAY I forgot pepper spray we walked past that house and that fucking dog came running out of nowhere and latched onto my dog's throat. I literally kicked the fucking daylights out of that dog (it was easily 120 lbs, my dog is 80lbs, and I am only 140lbs) while screaming ""COME GET YOUR FUCKING DOG"" 


after a minute the GSD let go and I chased it pretty much roaring GET THE FUCK AWAY and I was fully prepared to break its neck. Well the owners weren't even fucking home!!!! It's too bad I didn't know the dog warden exists at the time because they can legally take away any unleashed and unattended dog because that thing was a hazard. 



My dog went from a super friendly rescue who LOVED to play, to a dog that is fear aggressive and CANNOT be around large dogs with upright ears. He is so scared he will tuck his tail and pee and then straight up attack any dog that looks like a German Shepherd. 


Thankfully a few months later those garbage people moved and took their dog with them. But I wish I could throttle all of them because they literallt ruined my dog's ability to interact with large dogs. He is only safe around dogs under 30lbs now. They destroyed a big part of our life that was going to the dog park because my dog had a blast with every dog that was in there. Wish I'd called the dog warden or had been able to stop the dog. But yano hindsight is 20/20"
