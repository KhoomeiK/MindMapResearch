cats,fdlm819,t1_fdlly3v,1578527194.0,Nice!!! I wanted to name my cat Mirri but we ended up getting a boy. I lobbied for “Ajani” but lost the battle to parental units haha
cats,fdl1xgb,t1_fdl1odx,1578515639.0,"Oh right on. 
Thought I heard an N sound on the end but had to ask.  
Mirri was the name of the first Cat-humanoid-esque main character in the story line.  Since the 90’s they’ve added way more creatures into the game that are cats. It’s awesome. 

Look into Magic Arena (MTGA). It’s free to play on windows, coming soon to Mac"
