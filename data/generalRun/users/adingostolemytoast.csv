australia,ffdynyf,t1_ffdrrtd,1579832208.0,Fun fact: there is no official language in Australia. The predominance of English is just a convention.

funny,ff4s7zw,t1_ff4neog,1579571186.0,"A *lot* of people would have to die for Andrew to take the throne.

Well, eight people. Three of whom are small children.

It's not likely to happen."

You are what you eat, and so are your babies."

creepy,femb1ss,t1_felw5nf,1579246692.0,"Hot water actually. As hot as you can stand without scalding yourself.

The heat neutralizes the sting. This works for quite a few insect stings as well."
LifeProTips,fej87y5,t1_feivvvu,1579161086.0,"Just a reminder that koalas aren't the only toasty critters in the Australian bush.

Consider donating to some of the more broad wildlife rescue orgs like WIRES https://www.wires.org.au/donate/emergency-fund or wildlife Victoria https://www.wildlifevictoria.org.au/donate/donate-to-wildlife-victoria"
UpliftingNews,feg1s0q,t1_fefymac,1579073214.0,"The expectation in joining the RFS is historically that it will take up a weekend a month in training and maybe a few days to a couple of weeks a year in the field when there is a fire. Easy enough to fit around a full time job or small business and still have enough paid leave to take a decent amount of holidays (most Australians get 4 weeks a year)

A lot of the RFS volunteers have used up their paid leave. They've been unable to do shifts for months. Their businesses have been left unattended.  It's not supposed to be this big of a sacrifice."
tallfashionadvice,fed7x69,t3_eoj584,1579002980.0,"Longtallsally.com, though as an American you'll probably find their prices expensive as it is UK based.

Make sure you read each item's reviews as their different lines have wildly varying quality and sometimes some whacky sizes but it's more reliable than the tall ranges on cheaper sites like Asos."
TwoXChromosomes,fec3ebz,t1_feb1qqh,1578966067.0,Knitting needles or wire coat hangers are the traditional instruments of choice.
AusLegal,fe4dvt5,t1_fe2ivui,1578858262.0,"Morally, ethically and legally a different point.  Not returning a library book deprives the library of that book. They can't lens out to anyone else and must pay you replace it.
 
Stripping DRM off a file you've already paid for a license to use deprives no one of anything.

Now I'm not saying it's morally, ethically or legally ok to do it (as others have noted, in addition to being a breach of the license it's a criminal act), I'm just saying that the two actions are not directly comparable."
aww,fdpvvzg,t1_fdpp48b,1578642666.0,"Sometimes the best strategy with a fire, particularly a fast moving one, is to run towards it rather than away and hope your speed going one way and its speed going the opposite direction means you won't be in the flames long enough to catch alight. Once you're through, you can relax in the first not actively smouldering patch of ground you can find. It's a much shorter distance to safety that way, if your top speed is fast enough.

Quite a few Australian animals adopt this strategy in extreme conditions."
aww,fdpvne3,t1_fdpsavd,1578642375.0,"Yup, plus chances are the mum has an even smaller bean sized Joey in her pouch - much lighter in an emergency"

todayilearned,fdp87aa,t1_fdoutjh,1578622277.0,"Even without plastic shopping bags you get plenty of bags in your groceries. Use your bread bags for the sort of waste that might make a sticky mess and just don't use any bag at all for the rest.
Besides, you need far less bags for garbage than you would get doing your shopping. Replacing plastic shopping bags with purpose bought bin liners is still a huge net reduction."
AusLegal,fdp4bsh,t1_fdopu9b,1578619683.0,Absolutely. It's always good to look around and be aware of your bargaining power on these situations.
