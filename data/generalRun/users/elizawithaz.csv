On the other hand, it lead me on a journey of ups and downs that really forced me to grow up. Also, I probably wouldn’t have not met my now fiancé if not for that accident. Life is weird, y’all."

13ReasonsWhy,ffeb939,t1_ffe9sie,1579841940.0,"That being said, I’m conflicted about the removal of the scene. I’m someone who suffers from suicidal ideations. I don’t actually want to die, but that doesn’t stop the intrusive thoughts. 

Hannah’s death scene scared the living daylights out of me. I’m glad that the producers didn’t try to romanticize her death. It was brutal and terrifying to watch. At the same time, it’s true that depicting the method can be dangerous. 

I prepared myself a head of time by reading up on how everything would play out. I paused the episode to give myself time to prepare to watch it.  I knew what to expect and still got triggered by watching Hannah’s death. 

I’m a grown ass adult who is lucky to have access to excellent mental health services. Watching that scene sent me to some bad places mental health wise. 

So, I mostly agree with the decision to remove the full scene."

In contrast, when depictions are done responsibly, the media can help to encourage help seeking, dispel myths, and reinforce hope – and ultimately save lives.”
