If so, one night when I was slightly drunk and up to nothing, my (24m) fraternity brother (28m) invited me up to his room to hang with him and his girlfriend (22f). What was offered as an invitation to come up and suck her titties (which were freshly healed from breast implants and ready to play) had actually turned into a chance to Eiffel Tower my friend’s girlfriend. My friend and I aren’t gay, but we’re definitely comfortable enough around each other. I’m cool with his girlfriend, and although she is pretty she didn’t really do it for me. In other words, I didn’t get it up. 

To make soft matters worse, my friend pulled his out and got blown while I was sucking augmented boobage. Now, I’ve never had another man’s penis *that* close to my face before. Even if he’s my friend, I glanced up and saw balls, cock, and ass. That pretty much ruined any chance of a three way trip to Paris. 

To answer this thread’s question: I regret not getting a head’s up about the situation, so that I could get my situation a heads up.
