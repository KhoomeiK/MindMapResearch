ExNoContact,fdmj4x9,t3_em4431,1578551791.0,"You go in as straight face as you can. You're there to do a job now and nothing else. You have to have the mentality that this is just an acquaintance now, no longer a friend, no longer a partner. It's another person that you have to achieve a goal with.

Not saying it's going to be easy, but that's how you think. Good morning, what needs to be done, are the only questions you ask. Anything outside that is not up for discussion. If you get asked questions, you need to state that you're busy and need to focus on work. Be respectful, but straight.

If anyone else brings it up, you can say that things didn't work out and you've decided it's best to go your separate ways. After that, you say that you gotta get back to work. No gossip, no bad mouthing, just work.

Finally, one lesson to take away from this - don't date people you work with."
