Didn't matter in the long run because I ended up buying a house, but for people trying to rent, and that's a lot of people, it really contributes to the housing crisis when you deny them for something that they did in the past.

So try pumping all the fluid out of the clutch fluid reservoir, you use something like a turkey baster or equivalent, and pump the clutch until the reservoir is completely empty. Then pour the DOT 5.1 fluid in and see how it works for you.

It's hard to make friends, male of female. Males all want to bang her and females see her as competition. 

It's hard to trust people because they always have ulterior motives. They are either intimidated or trying to take advantage of her.

I've seen her hide after the pizza delivery guy or some type of service worker come to our apartment. Safety is constantly an issue because she's had people linger around afterwords trying to talk to her/get her number. 

Everything she accomplishes on her own, a nice job, a raise, buying a new car isn't attributed to her intelligence or work ethic, people assume that she only got those things because she is pretty. 

People always try to break her down and find some fault with her. Whether is her relationship status or financial situation, people want to see her fail. 

She gets asked out all the time and what most people would feel is unwanted attention after a while. This not only gets tiring, but sometimes scary, because some guys don't know how to take no for an answer. 

It becomes the only thing that she's known for even though she's an extremely hard working, intelligent and caring person. She's just known for being beautiful.

So yeah, many people think it's a ""privilege"" but it can also be a major drawback as well. It can really take a toll on you, because of the many reactions that people have to your beauty that are not always positive."

unpopularopinion,fedt0r7,t3_eoeo80,1579019264.0,"Especially with ""independent"".

Every woman I've known that goes around loudly proclaiming how ""independent"" she is has actually been the exact opposite. They are almost constantly in a relationship, have several children they can't afford to raise that are from different men, collect child support, welfare, alimony, food stamps, Section 8 housing, have trouble holding down jobs and are just a general burden on society.

Probably the most DEPENDENT type of people around."
IdiotsInCars,fedan4r,t1_feda4pm,1579005838.0,"Exactly. My car is almost 14 years old now and even the traction control on it from that time reduces engine speed and applies the brakes to each individual wheel.

I'd have to purposely turn it off, have a bright traction control off light on my dashboard, and purposely go out of my way to over steer the car to lose control of it like that."

In today's world, all of your arrest records and conviction are just a Google search away so even if your crime was one that society deems as ""forgivable"" it will still possibly haunt you during a job search."
news,feaxe34,t1_feawpiw,1578953190.0,"I think the use of the word ""expunge"" is incorrect. Even if used correctly, from a legal stand point, and her record is cleared, which is unlikely, there's no escaping the internet. 

What she did will impact her for the rest of her life no matter how much she tries to hide or erase it."
news,feali69,t1_fe9kvmb,1578950096.0,"Yeah she's a terrible person, there's no denying that, but what are we really accomplishing by trying to keep someone unemployed for the rest of her life? She will need to make a living somehow and I think we just create more problems for society by intentionally keeping her from getting a job.

Her short sentence was ridiculous, but if that was the sentence that was given and she served it, then we should leave her be.

Sure many potential employers will pass her up because of what she did, just to avoid negative press to their business which is understandable, but if someone does take a chance on her and she's a good employee who doesn't get into any further trouble, both personal and at work, then we should leave her the fuck alone."
worldnews,fea4xrw,t1_fe9d4le,1578944410.0,"Another theory I thought of is that many men who fall into that ""machismo"" lifestyle are men who have been raised by single mothers and did not have a strong father figure in their lives, or if they did, the father figures were bad influences. They become too emotional and impulsive. I mean who gets mad because someone is in their territory or looked at them the wrong way?

In essence, they were never taught how to be real men."

Some of the puzzles looked ridiculously difficult or obscure to figure out, especially for the olders versions on NES.

I think people mostly look back on these games with nostalgia, but I bet at the time when they were playing them many people found the games frustrating and repetitive. 

I did however play The Phantom Hourglass on DS and a Link Between Worlds on 3DS and found them to be entertaining and well made."
