tifu,fficyhv,t3_etk8ts,1579970912.0,"Lol shortly after they were married my mom tried to wake my dad up from a nightmare.  He was flailing around and whimpering so she shook him and said ""honey, wake up!""
He sat up, opened his eyes, looked right at her and screamed at the top of his lungs. He actually woke up shortly after but has yet to live this down. It's my second-favorite story of things my dad has done in his sleep."

AmItheAsshole,ff5965h,t1_ff58hb3,1579583991.0,"You still ask the former bride to be if it's okay before you start telling everybody else. That way you adhere to common decency AND still have time to cancel if the majority can't make it.
Besides, they're sisters, most of the family people were already going. Plus, from what it says, she wasn't asking people if they'd be able to make it, she was telling them [this is our wedding now](https://imgur.com/WzKQNoi)"

AmItheAsshole,ff1r0ca,t3_eqzf0e,1579484270.0,"I think NAH is the best verdict, although to me the mother is borderline for jumping *right* to that conclusion about her own son *and* refusing to hear other possibilities. However, it's the shock and the hurt and I feel if she has some time she might listen if it's explained what her son is feeling and going through. 
He feels rejected by the cultural community due to his ambiguous appearance. That doesn't mean he's racist or even that he's not interested in his culture. It's just that he feels like an outsider within it, like he's intruding on something, and so he's more comfortable stepping back from that."

occult,fenfjh2,t3_eq2sx0,1579283598.0,It's an astronomical ring. Basically an armillary sphere that can be used as a portable sundial and astrolabe. These showed up sometime in the 1500s and are pretty cool.
