Sometimes I imagine how much calmer life would be with fewer calendar events to juggle and knowing my husband will be home almost every night of the week. I think about us taking a break to focus on other things and take a breather from processing and scheduling and negotiating and talking about feelings.... it can get tiring. But I’m also a person who doesn’t ID as poly; I’m a person in non-monogamous relationships. It’s something I do, not am. Which is a diff perspective from most folks here."

loseit,fe6otj9,t3_enyqbf,1578898576.0,"Your friend is a tit. 

I was always overweight and at one point obese. So I get the crazy mixture of emotions that comes with that, and with seeing someone she probably feels is “in the trenches” of experiencing life as an obese person who is actually achieving weight loss goals. I can assure you it’s all from a place if insecurity and frustration. Guaranteed she wishes she could drop the weight but is convinced that, for whatever reason, it’s not possible, and the answer to being happy in that cases lies in “fat acceptance.” Seeing you change your diet and your weight flies in the face of that belief system. 

I wouldn’t expect to have any long in-depth talks with her. Find ways to be polite but direct and shut the convo down. “I’m enjoying changing up my diet and the new  workouts I’m trying.” “I feel like my mood and mobility have been improving so I think this is what works for me.” Make it a statement on the changes (diet, exercise) themselves being a positive thing for you and don’t talk about losing weight. She can’t argue with you being happy with a new lifestyle."

If we can accept that asexual/aromantic people exist, who need 0 romantic and sexual partners, why not accept some folks need just one at a time?

It’s a huge deal-breaker for a lot of people. You know it, they know it. Which means not clarifying it early on will feel weird at best. What if you went out with a woman and it was five dates in that she mentioned, “oh btw I have a six year old and I’m a single mom. Hope that’s ok.”  Leaving out mention of huge potential incompatibilities is poor form to me, especially when someone is off the beaten social path. 

Back when I was way less experienced with dating and relationships, I was looking for something vaguely monogamish, but lacked the skills to set those expectations. Dude dropped the “I’m non-hierarchical poly and negotiating relationship agreements is off the table” six weeks into dating. You bet it felt like a scam."

AskWomenOver30,fcgs1az,t3_eh189p,1577643509.0,"My parents are in their early 60s. 

They moved from Europe with us kids at 30, and for about 18 years they worked at the same place, carpooled together, ate lunch together, drove home, ate dinner together, and then watched a movie and ate ice cream in the evening. Then off to bed to do it all again. They celebrated 40 years together this year and still love each other very much. Their companionship is very strong, they love traveling in the same way so they have shared experiences to keep them close, they have a core group of friends, and they laugh a lot together. I model my marriage in them; hubby and I met almost 7 years ago. We have occasional bumps and stresses, and a couple unresolvable disagreements, but we can’t imagine not doing this crazy ride together. 

Alternative viewpoint: a marriage doesn’t have to be a failure if it ends. One of you dying first shouldn’t be the bar.  People change and grow apart. As long as it was a rich, loving experience that left you both better in the end, it must have been worth it."

exredpill,fcgmdg3,t3_eh6vez,1577641713.0,"You have mountains of work to do on yourself before you try for a relationship. This chip on the shoulder resentful attitude towards women, as if you’re owed sex and romance, and if you’re not getting it it’s bc women hate you for some reason, and you just wanna be with someone “hot”.... guarantee we women can sense it and run the other way. That attitude ranks on the level of raging BO in terms of attractiveness. 

There are many men and women with your level of sexual and romantic experience out there. By 27 I’d had 1 relationship and 3 sexual partners, and had a 3 year dry spell between 1 and 2. I also wanted something to change, so I decided to work on my social anxiety, improve my social skills, talk to people, show up to clubs, bars, and social events even if it was briefly and difficult at the start, I went on dozens of awkward dates and had a dozen awkward hookups. But I learned a lot. Five years of this suddenly landed me in a loving, secure relationship and much better sex. But that doesn’t just HAPPEN magically as you seem to think. It takes effort, it takes work. It’s only easy for a tiny fraction of humans. You are not unique and this process works the same for you as lots and lots of others (even with your mental health issues.)"

Sometimes foods: meat, fish, cheese, white rice, dark chocolate

Rare indulgences: everything else

Drink water, green or herbal tea, seltzer. Coffee when going out. No alcohol continues!

Eating 16:8 if I can manage, or at least 14:10. No internet at waking, get out of bed at 7:30! Continuing working out 3-5x week and all the walking/hiking I can schedule in! :D
