Despite this, we know that the amount of inertia against that will make it close to impossible at any established company/project. C/C++ will almost certainly be the de facto standard at many companies with established projects, Rust just hasn't had the time to gain popularity in the industry yet."

You have a great work portfolio! It'd shine better if each heading had 3 (maybe 4 tops) bullets describing 1. What you did, 2. A small description of technologies used, and 3. Tangible results."
offmychest,fgebbkc,t3_exwlk3,1580695662.0,"I grew up one of the only brown kids in the middle of nowhere California, and i feel this so much. It's at a point where I don't like to admit I'm Indian anymore. Indian coworkers will try to get me to participate in discussions and I pretend I don't know what they're talking about because in my head, the less Indian I am, the better.

It's even worse when I talk to my close friend group (who are mostly Chinese) and they will straight out say that Chinese people tend to not like Indian people, and they're glad I'm ""not like most Indians"". Kinda just justifies me denying which culture I was born into."

books,fdc5pty,t1_fd39uf5,1578267624.0,"For me it's because they both scratch the same itch: I love good plots. Maybe 10-20 years ago, games weren't as utilized as storytelling mediums as they are now, so the only choice for someone who wanted good stories were books. Modern gaming has improved dramatically the quality of storytelling, and gives you an immersive experience to boot."
