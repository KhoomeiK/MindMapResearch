massage,ff8vwsv,t3_es6fpt,1579697867.0,"It depends on the person and how they manage their bodies and hands and how they exercise proper body mechanics; I was told that in massage therapy, the hands are usually the first to go(more specifically the thumbs). While it is true that we usually have an average of 10 years, I've heard of some who've lasted nearly 20 years before retiring. I'm hoping I can last in the industry before I reach age 40/50. A girl can dream lol

As for plans for after massage therapy, I don't know about others, but for me, I've thought about either going back to doing hair; just simple haircuts if my hands will allow me, or crazy enough, a tattoo artist. I've been doing paintings and art since I could remember and have even sold a few of my pieces before; many people had encouraged me to go into tattooing saying my art would look amazing. Though my parents didn't outright say no, they did discourage me from it because ""I might accidentally mess something up and tattoos are permanent""...

But thankfully, I'm a grown-ass adult and can make my own choices. Though I also know it will take me some time to get to a level where I considered a professional, so maybe while I'm interning at a tattoo parlor, I can work out of a small salon/barber shop. Or if I'm still able to handle it, I can stick with just doing house calls while also teaching massage at my old school. Who knows lol"

Yes, you will likely be massaging each other everyday, though I don't know how other massage school do their practicals, and after a certain time and if your school has the accommodations, you'll likely be made to work in the school's clinic where you'll massage actual clients under an instructors supervision.

Your age and personal lifestyle shouldn't matter, just like how gender and sexual orientation shouldn't matter;  one of my classmates was in her mid-late 40s. As long as you're able to give a good massage, you should be fine.

Second, while I can see where this lady would be going with using trigger point therapy and stretching in her massage(I use this in my massages sometimes), the fact she never once communicated to you or asked you anything like, ""Is the pressure okay?"" ""Do I need to lighten up or go deeper?"" ""Feel any discomfort?"" etc etc also bothers me. This is how people get hurt, god forbid she accidentally pulls a muscle or causes bruising on a client, or causes some sort of contraindication to occur in the session.

Then, you have to take the MBLEx or the Massage and Bodyworks Licensing Exam to get your license.

For me, I have the freedom to set my own hours and control my schedule; how many clients I work on in a day and how many hours I wanna work, I can even control which clients I take. The only downside I can think of for this job would be the fact that massage is still stigmatized as being a place where the therapists are the stereotypical masseuse who are either supermodel and Barbie-like or are WWE and Hulk-like, and there's even some people who believe a spa/massage clinic is where you always get a Happy Ending.

And speaking of, while not all places are that are like that, in my state there are definitely Happy Ending-type places around that somehow manage to get away with it, and we unfortunately get mistaken for those types of places or people. Even when they(mostly men) see that you're a professional, they'll still try to get funny with us. Luckily, we have the right and authority to end the session and ban that person from ever setting food on our spa grounds. We're even taught all the different laws and terms in relation to what is and isn't acceptable for both the client and therapist.

autismacceptance,fe38fri,t1_fe2zvgr,1578846915.0,"I went through something similar in the way of speech delay; though my case was a bit different as far as how I was able to overcome it. According to my mom and my records, I was hitting my developmental milestones just fine for the first year and a half of my life, and suddenly, as in overnight, I just...stopped. I didn't talk, respond to sounds or my name being called, etc. It was as if I had hit a massive roadblock as far as my development; it was because of how drastic and sudden the change was that my parents went and had me looked at. That's essentially how my family found out I was autistic, and I can only imagine how terrifying that must've been for them.

As for how I overcame it and began talking again...well, that was also pretty sudden and out of nowhere; it was like I had suddenly hit the on switch in my brain one night and suddenly started talking again, in like, complete sentences lol. I must've been around 5 or 6. According to doctors, my brain was basically acting as a sponge that absorbed all the information it was receiving during my mute period, and when the time came, it finally released.

I know it seems like it couldn't be true, and to be honest, it really does sound pretty unreal, but that's pretty much how it happened. I was given speech therapy as well as therapy to help with my social skills, helping me to read body language and so on. It's hard, I know for a fact. But please don't give up. I was going through the struggles of living with autism during a time when it wasn't even a common thing, where today it's so common and relevant that we have tons of resources available for both parents and children to use to help them.

Second, all atheism is is a lack of a belief in any god or religion. Agnostics, however, while they're more or less similar to atheists, also are aware that they don't know if there truly is a god or not; they're also usually open to the possibility of god existing as long as there is proof to back up that claim, and no, Bible verses don't count as proof. 

And finally, while I don't believe in or agree with Christianity, I'm not gonna make someone change or not be around them just because they're religious; it's when they try to force me to change that shit goes down, but in a civil manner lol.
