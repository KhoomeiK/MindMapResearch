I'm not a calligal too. 

Your version reminds an arcade game draft.

Have fun with journalling!"

minimalism,fe2953k,t3_enn0nk,1578835850.0,"Maybe, just maybe she thinks you're deprived of fun because of your minimalist lifestyle. That you've resigned from being happy and she feels uncomfortable with this. Not an advice maybe but a hint how you may start understanding the situation. If this is true, you might try asking her for fun things like a cinema subscription (no idea if you have it in your country), beauty salon voucher etc. And then talk a lot how much fun you have had - she needs feedback on how she provided you with fun and happiness.
Just a thought from a mother's view. Good luck with your relations."

bujo,fe16ut6,t1_fe10v7n,1578823169.0,"It was seen by hand and mostly improvised. I cut off the cover from this old agenda, cut out the fabric wit a big surplus on all four sides and folded it at longer sides first. I used paper clips (the ones BuJo people use for keeping the journal open) to keep it in place. 
Then I folded the shorter ends inside (1cm maybe) to stop the fabric from fraying and tacked them. Next I folded the side in to create side pockets for sliding the notebook in (with a little surplus because when closed the cover needs a bit more space). Paper clips again and I sewed the sides with overhand stitch. 
After removing the tacking I was ready to slide my notebooks in. I suppose this could be done with a sewing machine, but I don't really like using it and also I wanted to get a really good tension of fabric, definitely not loose.

NotHowGirlsWork,fe0qo4b,t1_fdjefxn,1578817526.0,The first photo shows hybrid nails that are very durable and everything. And I think this guy remembers times where a normal nail polish would be destroyed if the person wearing it started some hard cleaning (the room in the pic needs only some clothes folding though). So I see where his way of thinking comes from - but he's still wrong and misogynistic AF.

tumblr,fdge82d,t3_el7p93,1578392615.0,My son is nine. Last year one of the kids in his class lost his gym bag and trainers. The teacher decided to dedicate all day for every possible action to find the lost possession. They wrote together an announcement to hang it in the hall and prepared some leaflets to distribute during breaks. Search teams were sent to different places and offices at school. At the end they wrote a report on their actions and the principal came to praise them for teamwork and being helpful. That's why I love this school so much.
