unpopularopinion,fgv1zta,t3_f0i95f,1581134895.0,You take that BACK!
TrueOffMyChest,fgv13xt,t1_fgv0x2a,1581134213.0,Anytime! Feel free to ask if you need any more information.
TrueOffMyChest,fgv0olf,t1_fguznq2,1581133889.0,"Going for your doctorate is always the way to go, IMO. You'll very likely never be out of work. However, a masters degree will afford you SUBSTANTIALLY more than your BA. Then you can actually do clinical therapy, school counseling, and several other things. It's a big commitment to completing a PhD, but it has been so worth it for me. I would also recommend a practical second major, I got my Masters is Biomedical Engineering, as my secondary major. Which conversely, helps me a lot in my current profession as well."
TrueOffMyChest,fgumuyb,t1_fgul9lf,1581124703.0,"Not at all, clinical is actually a better foundation for private practice. Me doing private practice is kind of a lateral move in the field, both skillsets are important of course, but I didn't know nearly as much about clinical therapy since that wasn't my emphasis. I think I have a pretty distinct advantage with this though since I specialize in human behavior, which makes me a bit better at initially identifying issues with my clients."
funny,fgulafj,t3_f0flx8,1581123639.0,TOTALLY my grandma. She's 83 and still fucking awesome !
TrueOffMyChest,fgukyyt,t1_fgtq3ex,1581123411.0,"Neuropsychology was my original path actually. My sophomore year though, I fell in love with forensics, and human behavior analysis, and I was really good at it, so that redirected my path. 

I do consulting with federal agencies, which is about 60% of my work. I opened the private practice because even though one on bbn one therapy was the last thing I wanted to do, it's where the real money is. So I am super fortunate to get the best of both."
TrueOffMyChest,fgukjx0,t1_fgu1dy7,1581123113.0,"Absolutely, the degree is way underutilized. There are so many things that should be open to these guys. 
Education, research, social work, marketing, just to name a handful."
AMA,fgsgnvn,t1_fgsfkm7,1581083815.0,"I went for exactly 6 months, when I lived where there wasn't a private school. It was ok, but overrated IMO, I always preferred private education."
AMA,fgsgjji,t1_fgsfij3,1581083722.0,For sure. Always fun.
AMA,fgsfgmv,t1_fgsfbxj,1581082878.0,I thought perhaps your answer would be so. Who's your favorite philosopher? Dead or alive.
AMA,fgsfb5s,t1_fgseo63,1581082757.0,"Haha, my grandpa ""aquired"" many weapons during his 30 year airforce career. Of course I'm not really supposed to have many of them, especially the ones from overseas. I inherited them all when he died. I have a really cool set of legit Lugers from his time in German too. I also have a pen gun, from his time in civil service, it shoots a .45, a snake shot round, and tear gas. If you've got the means for a barret, do it, absolutely worth the money."
AMA,fgsdnsz,t3_f09zeg,1581081407.0,"One of them knows, surely. Perhaps they just haven't confronted you about it?"
AMA,fgsdibc,t1_fgscjrs,1581081276.0,"Good choices, I've been shooting my whole life as well. At the range every weekend from about 4 years old. In my car, I carry a walther .40 in a dash holster under my steering wheel, and a keltec 556 under my front seat (a little overkill, but I have reason for this) my conceal weapon for on my person is generally a sub Kimber .45 ultra crimson. 

At home I have a Semi automatic 12 gauge in 3 locations,  as well as various other handguns around the home. My favorite however, is my Winchester. 44 magnum rifle that was my grandma's, and my 30/30, also my grandma's. She Carrie's a snub nosed .357 in her purse to this day. And at 82 can still shoot a soda can at around 25 yards, she's impressive. I don't hunt, so I'm not familiar with what's appropriate for that. I do have many rifles and assault style weapons though (many were my grandpas) probably the coolest though is a set of twin .50's off an old airforce Jeep. I have the mount and everything. Last year I got a Barret .50 as well, been wanting one forever."
AMA,fgsbd6t,t1_fgsb7fa,1581079354.0,"Oh ok, I've been in both, I preferred the local schools though. Have you ever been to public school? 
It's good to have the opportunity for better education, it certainly gave me an advantage."
AMA,fgsb0e3,t3_f09dg2,1581079014.0,"Best weapons for individual purpose? Home protection, hunting, zombie apocalypse? Every day carry? Armed robbery? GO!"
AMA,fgsat14,t3_f09k03,1581078816.0,"Boarding school, or local ?"
AMA,fgsaqhx,t3_f09noj,1581078748.0,Are you really though? Are any of us?
