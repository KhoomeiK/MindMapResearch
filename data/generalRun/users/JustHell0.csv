iamatotalpieceofshit,fdd30v8,t1_fdd2f0v,1578292732.0,"I said I was done, I aint reading your pointless trash of an argument anymore.

Sad you dont have anything better to do than this.
You have my pity"

iamatotalpieceofshit,fdd1r63,t1_fdd11r6,1578291347.0,"Cause of the title and the sub it's on, not an out there 'assumption' to make.

Fucking hell you lot are both stupid and annoying.

Edit: Keep proving me right reddit, the other guy replying said the exact same thing I did.

He has +8, i have -6 .... For the exact same point.

Think for yourselves, watching you lot 'Baaaarrrr' along mindlessly is scary as fuck"
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdd1n0g,t1_fdd11b6,1578291217.0,"Yeah, maybe it was a unicorn or the magic school bus, lets just assume all sorts of shit to keep this garbage going.

And ALL FOUR of them fell/willingly jumped in?

Fuck this stupid pointless shit, I genuinely have better shit to do and I sure as fuck hope you do too."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdd0ppi,t1_fdd0hlx,1578290223.0,"So we're assuming a mumma cat now too? 

Maybe it was Ron Weasly with his flying car or Mary Poppins?

I mean, if we're just going to assume shit with no basis, for the sole purpose of having a pointless fucking arguement, we may as well go all out with it.

Edit: yup, I was right, OP made a comment saying the skip has terrible paint fumes.

What mother cat would leave their babies in a closed in, open top, paint fume reaking skip bin that has no where for them to run and hide during the hottest summer on record?

Maybe yall dont know as much about cats as you think you do."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdd0hzg,t1_fdd01du,1578289984.0,"How so? That multiple kittens, barely bigger than a ciggie pack, probably couldnt nor would have reason to scale the sides of a skip bin during the hottest summer on record? (4-5feet high minimum)

You're just assuming the type of skip it is too.
I'm at least drawing conclusions from evidence given, instead of assuming shit and correcting others with info that may not even be applicable to this scenario.

These kittens were clearly dumped in there"

Why must everyone make asinine and always wrong assumptions of others instead of just staying on fucking topic?"
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdcmbyk,t1_fdcjvul,1578278469.0,I think you're assuming your little net of experience is applicable to the norm
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdcioul,t3_eh9d7m,1578275871.0,"Wow, what a waste of food.

You should have just taken the side and eaten them togeather. The difference would have been so minor that you wouldnt think of it an hour later anyway"
IAmA,fdcegok,t1_fdbi7cm,1578272903.0,Yeah but so do politicians
