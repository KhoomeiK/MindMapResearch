The one who is needy, Abi, could have everything but she just wants to be by her humans. If a door is shut, she’ll sit there and wait for it to open. Sometimes she goes off by herself when we are sleeping cause we will find her in the living room but for the most part, she like to have attention and sit on laps and be petted and talked to."
