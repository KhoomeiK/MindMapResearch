Drugs,fdjnmga,t1_fdhkers,1578479675.0,"This is me. I've smoked on and off for about 12 years First few years I was a social smoker, then 4-5 years solid with breaks when I went on holiday. Then nothing for about 2 years, then solid for another year or so and haven't smoked now in about 6 months. During the breaks I didn't miss it, didn't really think about it and had no negative side effects. Everyone is different though so everyone will experience it differently. I also think the strains that you smoke will have an effect, I've never liked the super strong genetically altered strains, preferring the more natural softer types."
relationship_advice,fdhzgiu,t3_elhjew,1578432987.0,"This is a bit worrying. You've only known him such a short time, you don't really *know* him. There's definitely red flags there. Coming from a woman who spent 3 years in an abusive relationship, I say you need to talk to your close friends and family about this so people close to you know what's happening should things get worse. My ex started with nit picking comments like that, pushed my friends and family away, hacked my phone and my social media. He slowly got more and more mentally abusive which turned into physical abuse. The relationship also moved very quickly and within a couple of months had moved in. I ended up calling the police on numerous occasions to get him removed from my house, then from outside my house when I'd managed to get him out and in the end had to take out a restraining order.

I'm not saying your relationship will end up like this, but please please let the people close to you know what's going on as that was my mistake, I hid it until it was unbearable and I was on the verge of suicide. I wouldn't want anyone else to go through what I went through. Be careful, look after yourself and do not let this controlling behaviour continue. This is not the basis of a healthy, loving relationship."

childfree,fdhojr4,t1_fdhha5m,1578427011.0,"I really enjoy it when they tell you once you spend time with children or hold a baby your view will change. Love, I've spent half of my life surrounded by the fuckers all that's done is cement in my mind the fact I DO NOT WANT ONE!"
childfree,fdhobr9,t1_fdhaekk,1578426880.0,"Exactly, people who don't want children will not marry someone who does. If they do it's selfish, on both parts. I broke up with an ex because of this exact reason, he wanted children and I didn't. It wasn't fair on either of us."
AskReddit,fdg9uqj,t3_el2az5,1578386317.0,"Oh shit, I've just finished the last episode of 'You'. Nice knowing you guys."
childfree,fdg9omz,t1_fdg9ff0,1578386083.0,"Exactly, it's as if because we are women and we are able to create a life we are automatically expected to and that there is something 'wrong' when we don't want to. My partner also does not want children, however as a male is not questioned about it or told that he will 'change his mind'. It is just accepted. It is my body, my life and I will do as I wish with it. I don't feel that I am missing anything by not bearing a child. In fact, after watching how life is with children, that would bring us both nothing but unhappiness."

unpopularopinion,fbokptc,t3_edxq2g,1577011640.0,So long as both sexes are courteous then there's no issue. i.e the men don't pee on the seat or leave it up and the women don't put sanitary items down the toilet (as there's normally no little bin in the mens)
