But, one thing he is great at is listening when were outside. Honeslty, since he was a pupper I've never really had to worry about putting him on a leash. He stays near me if I'm outside doing something, if I tell him to go pee somewhere he'll go do it, and if I ever let him venture off a bit he always comes back at the first call.

personalfinance,ffbvthm,t1_ffbuo1q,1579784448.0,"In no way is this a fraud train, let me lay it out for you more coherently:

1. I made a $2,000 purchase in December on a Capital One CC that I hardly use. Balance on my CC after the purchase was $2,000. 

2. While I admit, in hindsight, that I shouldn't have manually scheduled a payment, I think it's pretty fair to think that if I manually pay the entirety of my $2,000 balance, then the auto-deduct would recognize that I *do not owe any money*, therefore not deduct. 

3. An ACH dispute form with my bank was required due to the second ""payment"" overdrafting that account. Therefore, I incurred one $50 fee, with the potential of another $50 within a set amount of days if the account is not replenished. So, in reality, the ACH dispute was for those fees (I was told by my bank to do this, and I explained to them that I also am getting a refund check in the mail from Cap One) 

4. I fully anticipate the bank to recognize that they didn't need to refund the $2,000 once they investigate my account further. Of course, I wouldn't go and spend that money because for one, it's unethical and two, because I know at some point they're going to come looking for it. 

5. My question is more in regards to what my obligations are. To this point, I've followed every step my bank has advised me to take. From the research I've done, my bank will likely issue a temporary credit to my account - but once I receive and deposit the physical check from Cap One, they'll end up removing the temporary credit."
personalfinance,ffbv906,t1_ffbv4s3,1579783916.0,"No my cc limit is much higher than 2k. My cc balance is actually posted as (-$2000) currently - which means I have an extra $2,000 credit in my account."
