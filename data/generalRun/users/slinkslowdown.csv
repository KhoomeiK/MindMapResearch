nanaimo,ffh1raw,t1_ffg19lk,1579920784.0,"For now, I'm looking for just CPR, so the first option is much better.  When I Googled for CPR courses in town, only the ~$200 courses came up.

I'm able to put aside $10-$15/month so that will be much easier/faster to save up for.

Thank you very much for the detailed info!  Will definitely work towards getting CPR-C.

Your username seems very fitting for you knowing all of that :)"

Is it just me who read that as *burrito*?"
nanaimo,ff9psid,t1_ff9opml,1579718242.0,"I've seen videos and read articles before, but if at all possible, I want the physical experience/practice of doing it.

It's probably going to be traumatic on *my* end, let alone a potential victim's end, if I ever have to do it IRL.  I know you have to go *hard* and probably break bones, and I want to be physically prepared for exactly that if I can help it.

Maybe I'll have to save up for a year to be able to afford it--regardless, I'm still interested in recommendations for any local programs over others."

I already have Narcan and training in that.

I've had to deal with a lot of medical emergencies in my 30 years of life--dealt with hundreds of seizures my father had, found my mother having a brain aneurysm, found a roommate dead a year ago, had to assist in a medical emergency at Wendy's a week ago...  I'd rather have the skill and never need to use it."

Tears dripped down Hitler's face as Pikachu told him that. Or at least he thought it was his tears, it could have easily been Pikachu's cum that was flowing down his face.

Hitler couldn't get himself to stop since he loved Pikachu so much that he was willing to do anything for him, even fuck him to death. And so he did.

As Hitler was about to cum again, he started mumbling. Then he told Pikachu, ""Do you what they used to call me on the streets? They called me weebo. They bullied me because of the love I have for you. But they do not undersatnd us. They're just jealous of us. Don't worry Pikachu. I will kill all of the Jews for you""

Pikachu smiled as Hitler said those last words. And then they both came. Pikachu's body couldn't handle this arousal and it collapsed. Hitler had fucked Pikachu to his death.

He was crying. He bent on his knees and kissed Pikachu one last time and whispered in his ears, ""Weebos are the master race. I will kill all of the Jews for you, my love"""
