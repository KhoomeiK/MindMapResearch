YangForPresidentHQ,fgrz3it,t1_fgrugzk,1581063454.0,"To me it's quite logical. Welfare programs are there to help ppl who can't get by themselves.
If you now have an extra income of 1000 a month, then there's a good chance you don't need welfare anymore.

But then I've always seen one of the main appeals of UBI, to be cutting out bureaucracy of welfare programs.

And then the other effects, like that it doesn't keep you down or demotivated. I hate the principal of many welfare programs, where if you take it, you want to keep it, so you feel a need to not increase your income."

TheExpanse,fgr5523,t3_ezy6yb,1581038394.0,"BSG is my favorite space Scifi show, I also really like Expanse and Firefly and there's probably been others that I don't think of right now. Stargate and Star Trek hasn't really caught my interest very much, the little I've seen didn't capture me.

Babylon 5 I have only ever heard mentioned by name. Never seen a single scene, picture, actor name, plot or anything. Should I watch it?"

Diablo,fgdu0yi,t1_fg9qi74,1580686864.0,Well they changed war3 classic. That would happen regardless of pre-orders
warcraft3,fgdpdpa,t3_exwezj,1580685026.0,"I can confidently say that very few people would be happy or impressed by that. It would look the same, but actually pretty much the same. It's too modest of an upgrade to pay any money for."

The thing about WC3 art style though, it's so nondescript, that your mind fills in the gaps with your own preference."

TheSilphRoad,fg946z3,t3_exbmpm,1580634045.0,"I did not read all that, but I suspect you are comparing the game with much worse offenders and reach the conclusion 'this is okay'. However you shouldn't compare with bad practices, but with good practices, then pogo suddenly won't look as good."

WC3,fg4xxe8,t1_fg4vwl6,1580513590.0,And Grubby has absolutely done that. He's just not throwing any tantrums because he still wants the stream to be enjoyable.
WC3,fg4nf01,t1_fg4mnl8,1580506936.0,"Alright, well to sum it up. 

He doesn't want to join the bandwagon of negativity, he believes his criticism is best given privately directly to the developers, which he has already done ages ago, and will continue to do.

He loves the game and it means everything to him, but also wishes things were better and he does acknowledge that people are right to be disappointed. His main goal is for WC3 to be the best and he can best help making that happen by focusing on the positives and having fun.

Basically

It sounds very reasonable and level headed. He agrees with the haters, but in a very nice and mature way. He doesn't want to take advantage of the situation by making videos that fuel the fire, when he has already given his feedback."
WC3,fg4lj9n,t1_fg4ggac,1580505779.0,But what language do you speak then?
warcraft3,fg4jre8,t1_fg3sj53,1580504693.0,"Well Settlers 2, 3 and 4 are amazingly fun and have just been on a huge sale. Not sure if the new one coming is worthy of the title, we'll see."
worldnews,fg309j0,t1_fg3033t,1580464183.0,"They didn't say that is what impeachment is, they said they think this needs to follow impeachment, because impeachment vy itself is not enough."
worldnews,fg2zog4,t1_fg2z9cx,1580463341.0,No they just clarified what they think needs to happen. Not defining impeachment.
warcraft3,ffyk4gm,t1_ffxjhjd,1580348337.0,"sure, but they looked worse than the original, not just modest improvements, but actually worse."

worldnews,ffsthsi,t1_ffr51zf,1580191876.0,"I like Bernie and most of what he stands for. However after learning about Yang I don't see the point in Bernie anymore. Yangs ideas and problem solver approach is much more appealing to me, and he is just a genuine dude on top of that.

Never in my life have I seen a politician with a platform like his, it's always a mixed bag, but with Andrew Yang I have trouble finding holes or disagreements. His platform isn't just policies that serve a set of interest groups, it's actually a complete vision for how things should be and I like where he wants to take us. And then he is not alienating anyone, he wants us to come together, and it's not just the usual democratic pretender bs. He doesn't talk anyone down, he talks them up.

Bernie is angry, and rightfully so, but It feeds the already very toxic us VS them mentality. I believe that is the wrong approach after I have seen another option that unites ppl instead."
worldnews,ffq10ur,t1_ffpdirh,1580114518.0,"Or you know, a unifier like Yang"
