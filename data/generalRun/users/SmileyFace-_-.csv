How many time are people going to repeat this non-argument. You think people don't know how taxes work? You think you're sharing some hidden secret information about how public projects are funded? When people say ""free"" they mean ""free at the point of access"". Everyone knows that public services are funded by the government and various taxes.

Are you kidding me? It's far easier to do business in Europe than America. You have over 120,000 regulations on your federal register and counting.

The costs of starting up a business in America are also extortionately higher than in most European countries.

Yeh, you clearly don't know what you're talking about. In Europe, we actually deal with problems through government regulation rather than self-regulation. There are numerous laws in Europe surrounding and curtailing lobbying efforts by massive entities. For example, in the UK, all MPs must disclose any donations over £5000 and gifts are (more or less) illegal. Secondly, European countries don't allow abuses of gerrymandering. Thirdly, Europe actually likes representative democracy, and changes its electoral systems to reflect that, until America which has been sucking FPTP's dick since its foundation. Fourthly, consistency's are deliberately kept small and candidates are given funding to run to prevent them from relying on private donors, unlike ""the land of the free"" where it's costs, on average, $2m to run for the House and $12m to run for the Senate. This all overlaps with why your democracy is ass."

facepalm,fgftr9p,t1_fgfr88x,1580747420.0,Of course not. But if Europe happens to do something that is objectively better then it does make America behind the times. The 24 hour clock is an example.

CapitalismVSocialism,fdmm3zh,t1_fdln5op,1578555168.0,">Democratic socialist is a previously rare term that essentially meant ""not quite anarchist but close"". It has come to mean a social democrat that is willing to court other leftists to achieve at least social democracy. A social democrat says social democracy is the most we can do. A democratic socialist says it is the least we can do.

What are you talking about? 

1. It's not a rare term. It was a term that was at the fore front of most dominant leftist movements in the 1920s-1950s, especially in the Britian and Germany. 

2. It never meant not quite Anarchist but close wtf lmao. Democratic Socialists want a huge state by pure admission. 

3. It has never meant a Social Democrat who is more ""passionate"" if you will. It's an entirely different line of philosophy, with entirely different key players, and came BEFORE Social Democracy did. Democratic Socialists believe a lot of things, but the reason they deserve a separate name and distinction is because 

i) They were the first to reject and critique Marx's revolutionary Socialism from the Left 

ii) They were the first to adopt the idea of Evolutionary Socialism 

ii) They encompassed dominant political players from the Fabian Society like Beatrice Webb and her husband. 

The list goes on.

>This is clear by Bernie's rhetoric. He himself won't go the extra steps, but he invites people further to the left to build on what he will create. He sees social democracy as a way to encourage the left, rather than satiate it.

Bernie isn't a Democratic Socialist by definition regardless of how much he likes to use to word. He's a Social Democrat. The reason he urges people toward Social Democratic policies is because *he is a Social Democrat*. Why is he a Social Democrat and NOT a Democratic Socialist you ask? Because the latter doesn't would be upset if Capitalism disappeared, and wants the outcome of their ideology to be the eradication of Capitalism. In comparison, a Social Democrat is still a supporter of Capitalism, who believes it needs to be tamed. Bernie is a supporter of Capitalism, and would not like to see it abolished. He is, therefore, not - CANNOT - be a Democratic Socialist."

I strongly disagree. Based on evidence, lobbying is not a major force in Social Democracies. This is based on so many factors that I could probably write a book about it if I cared enough, but in summary, the electoral system, regulations and economic factors which make lobbying relevent are not actually that pertinent in a Social Democracy. Take one example. In the United States, it costs, on average, $2m to run for the HOR and $12m to run for Senate. How is one expected to muster enough money to make that a reality? Lobbying. In comparision, Social Democracies often have very small constituency sizes. It costs next to nothing to run and very little to gain votes. One does not need to be at the whim of a lobbying group to win and make laws. This is why there are very few examples of lobbying making any real difference in Social Democracies and even Liberal Democracies like the UK. 

Therefore, to say reforms only go as far as the ruling class allow it, is just wrong in my opinion. In Social Democracies reforms will go as far as the public allow it. You could argue that the public will not go far enough due to false consciousness due to the Capitalistic system they live in, however, if you believe that then you are a revolutionary Socialist by implications anyways. 

>Next there is the issue of how capitalism as a system works. Under social democracy, the exploitation of workers for their surplus labor doesn't go away. The only thing that changes is the financial pain is eased slightly.

You make it seem like people who are living in the US go home and cry every night because of ""wage slavery"" and that people in Sweden cry at least once a week due to their ""awful"" predicament. 

What you fail to account for is that Social Democracies rank the highest consistently on any index you can find, be it the Happy Planet Index, HDI, SEDA, GII, EFI etc. These people are fine. They're better than fine, they're great, on an almost unprecedented level.

These countries are flourishing. Not only that, they've proven that Social Democracies is the best system we have ever come up with. Now, if there is evidence that people in Socialist countries are living better lives or have lived better lives in the past due to Socialist policies, then you may change my mind, but there isn't. You're merely arguing your point from a belief - it is no better than believing in God and claiming that belief is inherent fact - it's not. In comparison, Social Democracies have got nothing left to prove. 

Why should we chase after a system which has failed in the past, against on that has consistent showings of unprecedented success."
