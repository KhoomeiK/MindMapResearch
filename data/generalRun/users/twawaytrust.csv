Multiple races working together in absolute harmony, a la Star Trek TOS. Leia subverts the Damsel trope, and the SW universe hasn't had an issue with that as a matter of tradition (Mara Jade, Mirax Horn, Ysanne Isard, Admrl. Daala, Winter, Mothma, etc.,) and the issue of differences between them are irrelevant to the good guys compared to what unites them and divides them (ideology and self-interest vs. collective interest a la Lando on Cloud City), consistently presenting liberalism as being the ""good way"" of doing things. Even the creator for the CIS defends them for relying on the Sith by using an economically liberal system argument, and complaints of urbanist preferences with self-interest ultimately don't mean much and fail to discuss the Republic's failures from the lens of, say, intersectionalist ideology.

>“We’re fighting the largest empire in the world, and we’re just a bunch of hay seeds in coonskin hats that don’t know nothing,” he [Lucas] says, referencing the American Revolution against the British Empire, and how he based the heroes of Star Wars on real-life rebellions against powerful empires.

What movie did you watch? The quotes I attached were from ANH.

Opening crawl describes the state of the rebellion and empire. The opening shot reveals the disparate resources they have. The first discussion between Leia and Vader and the choked out rebel captain also shows that this is a Diplomatic vessel being attacked, that there is a Monarchy (Alderaan), and that its Princess was running stolen plans, implying that the rebellion has agents working either within the empire or is staging raids. We also learn how the rebels are considered (""part of the rebel alliance and a traitor."") The Senate is mentioned.

Next we see Darth Vader, he joins Grand Moff Tarkin and the other officers, discussing the Imperial Senate's abolition, and how the Empire had grown incredibly militaristic, with the Moffs ""assuming direct control over their territories,"" in the words of Moff Tarkin, and ""Fear would keep the systems in line.""

We also hear from Luke that Tattooine is remote, relies heavily on used equipment, and is far from the gleaming resource-rich Empire's core- ""if there's a centre of the universe, you're about as far from it-"" we also know that the Empire was recently in a war (""Years ago you helped my father during the Clone Wars"" from the recording).

We also know that Leia was on her way to a Rebel Base, and that the Empire seeks to smash this resistance. 

We learn a LOT about the state of the galaxy with the dialogue, which, while not always delivered in the smoothest way, at least sets up the world/universe they're living in and paints broad strokes for the EU to fill in later.

>Now, visually speaking (And visuals are paramount in film, seeing as it is a visual medium), who does the Empire resemble?

Redcoats for the Empire's foot soldiers? They tend to wear an inconvenient color and move in large numbers. Really though they're just wearing a uniform, like almost any other country on Earth. Maybe German Empire WWI Stalhelm and diver mask for Darth Vader, but ""German"" isn't necessarily ""Nazi.""

Note the lack of any nazi iconography- this is from World War One- there weren't any Nazis yet. Black was also a more commonly used foot soldier color for Germany and Sweden in WWI. Not WWII, but WWI.

https://larsgyllenhaal.blogspot.com/2010/08/missing-link-in-helmet-history.html

Here's an interesting article from 2010 on the history of helmets, titled ""From Dürer To Darth"", written by ""Author, film researcher and member of the Swedish Military History Commission."" He makes the claim the design is inspired by Sweden's helmets.

You cannot tell me that the empire aren’t supposed to be space nazis.

Okay, hold up. You *ARE* aware that he basically cribbed a lot of the *Rebel Alliance* off of Nazis, right? There's elements of Nazis in Star Wars- german Stalhelm design from WWI on the back of Vader's mask for example, but check this out:

[Look Familiar?](https://i.stack.imgur.com/glH1p.jpg) That's from Triumph of the Wills.

He cribbed the living shit out of several conflicts and political movements at once- not the least of which was Vietnam. What was really impressive to me is in how it came together cohesively. The dogfighting was, for example, sourced heavily from WWII- the Falcon being ball turret gunners a la B17 and Battle of Britain Nazi bombers in their attempts at repelling fighters.

This is why the Falcon isn't seen maneuvering much in space battles when fighting TIE fighters in ANH. Much like Nazi/Allied bombers, they were not supposed to ever break their formations, even to try to limit the profile of the strafing enemy fighters, for fear of reducing their bombing efficacy. Even though it makes no sense in-script, they keep moving 'forward' and do not maneuver. We see them shake that up in ESB, but in ANH it's definitely derivative off of that.

Then the Japanese Torpedo runs/Junker JU88 diver bombers when doing the Death Star Trench Run. One might also make a case for the sinking of the *Bismarck* or *Yamato*, though the latter was from a high altitude that the bombers were in very little danger, whereas JU88s suffered incredible casualties, which is why their distinct Jericho horns are most prominently featured in early war footage, but entirely absent toward the end of the war. They were only initially devastating- once enemies realised how predictable and unmaneverable they were when diving, they became easy pickings for enemy fighters to swoop in from behind and pick them off. (Gee, where did we see that in ANH?)

We also *definitely* see more of the Allies presented as derivative of the Viet Cong in Return of the Jedi in the forest vs. the Imperial shield base and garrison. History.com even talks about this. There's also parallels to Nixon that the same article goes into- and like I pointed out, even to Afghanistan, albeit obviously unintentionally given the dates. The only one George himself has talked about as a parallel were WWII fighter film techniques and Vietnam for the politics.

> 
As for TLJ, who would’ve thought that the movie with a central theme about failure and learning from it has most characters be failures most of the movie? The fact that most of the characters are male is because most SW characters are male.

Why am I not surprised you're also a TLJ fan. Look, I've liked Rian Johnson's work, been following him since Brick. The action in Brick made sense- and I understood why people fought here as well, but unlike in Brick the fight sequences lacked major consequences beyond creating a contrivance.

When the core of the movie is ""failure"" and the failure is because ""everyone in this film has rocks for brains,"" then it's not a very inspiring or even a very compelling movie. I'm not a tactical genius, for example, but one thing occurred to me: if the Falcon is a YT-1300 Freighter, which is reiterated in their own EU, why doesn't anyone ask them to go freight in some goddamn space fuel? That thing makes like 5 trips through the course of the film back and forth to and from the action. It's one thing to not want to get blasted, but man are you telling me someone's gonna say ""nah, no gas for you.""

Almost all the women in the film get at least one thing done.

If the ""resistance"" was that unpopular, then maybe it's a good thing they got their asses handed to them.

Compare the following as ""political."" 

""The Moffs will assume direct control, The Emperor has dissolved the Imperial Senate."" And the Peaceful People of Alderaan, Luke's description of the remoteness of Tattooine and life as a ""moisture"" farmer (rice patty farmer, tbh), the killing of his aunt and uncle equivalent of US troops coming through and mowing down the villagers suspected of being VC fuelling into Luke's emergence into what was the corollary of the Knights Templar, a religious order that got shafted back in the late medieval period if you're keen to learn some interesting history and politics. Really neat stuff, how he wove those together into a single universe. It's like he took all the interesting factions throughout history and stuck them into the same period, giving them different resources, appearances (farmer getup with long rifle vs. monk robe with swrd, vs. plastic uniform with rifle reflecting the uniformed US Troops, vs. smuggler/pirate getup, vs. immaculate 'princess"" white dress (a spacefaring societal planet that has a monarchy), etc., all reflecting different backgrounds. Neat way of weaving it all together. It's a lot more complex than ""hurr nazis = empire, liberals = good guys."" 

Knights Templar, just for starters, were so illiberal it would make your head spin, lmao. The Empire is basically an unholy admixture of church and state- the Emperor and Vader as sorcerers, for example, doesn't hold much to Nazi imagery, economic theory, social theory, or to its political theatre, but does hold to the Vatican's betrayal of the Knights Templar. The EU does try to run with the Empire = Nazis bit, but that's EU, and up to the individual writers, and I'm judging films as being the preeminent contribution to lore, and the further/narrower the audience/less accessible it is to the general public (e.g., tabletop games, pinball machines, etc., played by a narrow sliver comparably to those who saw the movie), then the less ""Canon' it is. As a result, the Main Canon in which they've tried to ""do their own thing,"" leads, then other media that isn't numbered (e.g., Solo) as playing second fiddle where they don't give it full focus, then streaming services like Mandalorian (where they just gave full control away and didn't bother), and then books- where they DID emphasise their Story Group (bunch of useless people) and proceeded to produce garbage and an incoherent universe and promote incompetence. Did you know Wendig wrote it in a weekend and introduced the same character three times and killed that same character off twice? Remarkable lack of effort.

Politics went from this long-winded, expository thing to trying to basically say ""men bad,"" as if that's a political statement rather than an opinion."
PrequelMemes,ffeipii,t1_ffeh424,1579849621.0,"It's fine to be political- but here's an alternative position:

Instead of space Nazis (which the EU tried to push, but it falls flat), we have a young farm boy in the middle of the desert who is radicalized into an ancient religion by a village elder who lives in the more mountainous regions. We see him and childhood friends from the neighbouring area launch a desperate attack on a US Carrier and manage to exploit an unknown design flaw, killing many by striking it with what is basically an unguided RPG into an exhaust port, causing the reactor aboard to go critical and irradiate/explode, killing all aboard and turning the US Supercarrier into a wreck, throwing a monkey wrench into the plans of an Imperialist America to project its power into the region, and giving a bit of relief to a beleaguered Alliance that makes good its escape, hiding out while America sets about its vengeance for the bloody nose it was just given (in much the same way as we stuck it sideways to Afghanistan post-9/11).

I think that's a better fit than ""space nazis,"" considering the religious overtones, desert environment, watercraft of enormous force projection that is the centre of a fleet arm, etc., considering that the Nazis had nothing of the sort of any of those beyond, perhaps, their adoption of various Pagan ideologies.

Especially considering that the film wasn't even meant to be about Afghanistan, it was meant to be more about Vietnam.

We can contextualise this all day, but we have George on record talking about what the film was about. 

It wasn't about Nazis. 

It wasn't about Afghanistan.

It was about Vietnam.

But there's a difference between that and- ""we can't let the men be right about anything, they exist in the plot to either be evil, incompetent, dysfunctional, or corrected by a woman at every turn."" Name a male protagonist who is none of those things in, say, Last Jedi. Luke? Total Failure. Chewie? Glorified uber driver who gets lectured on veganism. Poe? Slapped around even though he's right. Finn? Turned into comic relief and his big mouth blows the resistance's (admittedly retarded) plan up. Del Toro/budget Brad Pitt? A snake. Hux? Humiliated. Snoke? A blind moron. Ben Solo? A lost little boy with severe issues.

Note that heck, of the characters I mentioned, not all of them are white, not all of them are even *human*. So you can take your little glib sentence at the end, roll it up sideways- and note that that isn't ""political,"" it's just straight-up bashing."
PrequelMemes,ffehi5y,t1_ffeg3iv,1579848217.0,"""no argument. Why you argue?""

Your own sentence is a contradiction. ""This statement is false.""

""Your next mission: Refuse this mission.""

and so on.

Here, almost every time they've branched out on their own, it has gone *disastrously*. 

[Chuck Wendig's ""Wibble Wobble"" TIE fighters.](http://i.imgur.com/2lgZue3.png) That was their idea of someone capable of replacing Timothy Zahn. That failed, spectacularly. He got fired, eventually, despite virtue signalling so hard that he could have pooped out a Crystal Star.

But that's okay, we'll hedge our bets! We'll try building a new EU to fill the intercene years of our heroes! ...with [comic book art so shitty it looks worse than a high schooler's attempts](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2RLr9az75fKuWmg32-P8hyYJdI0=/0x0:874x309/1200x800/filters:focal(404x93:542x231)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/58414339/jedda.0.png)

Compare that abomination to [what used to be.](https://spiralcomics.com/images/comics/JAN20/JAN201017.jpg) It's not even *close* in terms of artwork- or storytelling.

So, ultimately, their own nu-EU failed them so badly in attracting new fans that they just gave up on original ideas.

Then they went to grave-digging into the EU that they just killed, complaining about how hard it was to come up with original ideas. They passed the wedding ring and gold tooth caps to rob the grave of the worst parts of it- namely, the Dark Empire saga. They went about using ~~The Eclipse (which had a SuperLaser)~~ new types of Star Destroyers, and cloning Emperor Palpatine. 

Disney has proven completely incompetent. If they do anything right, it's seemingly by accident, or by studios that are divorced from them or away from their ever-watchful eye, stuff that flies under the radar, or by people who are not under Kathleen Kennedy's watchful eye (Mandalorian directors).

PrequelMemes,ffeeuqe,t1_ffe3kw4,1579845360.0,"We're not completely sure what those reshoots were or how it altered the story, aside from differences from the trailer that weren't present in the final film. We *do* know that the hyperspace jump from within a gravity well *severely* changed how hyperspace worked to escape the Death Star firing its main laser in the test, which sets us up for Poe's hyperspace-skipping seen in TRoS- which was possibly added later.

Having actually read the Centerpoint series, I remember when the Alliance had to enter Corellia with heavily modified hyperdrives and suffered *major* electrical burnouts for even attempting it.

What we saw from the trailers which likely predated a lot of the reshoots (""I intend to rebel"" plus staring down a TIE fighter), we were possibly robbed of a story that had better pacing. 

The set design was *fantastic* throughout the movie, as was the score, and we already know how the movie was intended to end- meaning we would have gotten the amazing Vader scene (and battle over Scariff) regardless of which director was in the chair, as well.

What's remarkable is that the Originals had a pretty transparent development process- there's a huge number of documentaries on everything from special effects, deleted scenes released decades later, how stunts were performed (jumping out of the exploding cockpits in the Death Star trench run), changes between theatrical to VHS to VHS Special Edition to the DVD version, to Blue Ray, (and so on) all being tracked by fansites and even official interviews with cast, crew, and more. Former directors, creators, and so on all talking about what they saw on-set.

Rogue One, on the other hand, has had none of that. Disney has managed to kept everyone's lips *completely* sealed on how these films developed over time. Maybe part of that's the way CGI has reduced the number of people exposed to a script or ""how it looks,"" but I think it's Disney- or maybe just no one cares enough to even ask, compared to the originals."

You agree with higher taxes on the rich? Would you roll it back to before the Johnson administration's tax cuts (inflation-adjusted)?

Yes. 

In the 1960s-90s companies were forced to make a choice: Either flee to countries that have no environmental regulations, or stay and try to tough it out with the EPA. The ones that stayed got *buried* or bought out by those who left. This means the only remaining corporations are ones who had no compunctions about leaving the worker behind to suffer in poverty, to offshore production, trade secrets, supply lines, and more. They have not a patriotic bone in their body, they care nothing for America, and feel no compunction about hiding taxes from it if it saves them a penny on balance. The ones who might've thought different once upon a time, if there ever were any, were all driven into the ground.

But I wouldn't spend this money on social programs for the non-worker. LibLeft/AuthLeft has seized taxation and used it as a mechanism for redistributive means to take from the worker and laborer and give to those who are able bodied but have contributed nothing. I am against this. If you pay in, you get something back beyond feeling good about yourself and 'whatever's left over we stuff into the potholes so you can get to work without breaking an axle, maybe.'

I'd use it for public expenditure- parks, roads, bike lanes, green infrastructure projects, education, and more.

(School would look very different to the systems we are pursuing now- special remedial schools for the miscreants, and good schools for those who behave, rather than shuffling the same poor students around, with no attempt at mainstreaming the miscreants onto the good students- idgaf about their race. If 50% of the problems are black kids, then those kids are getting their asses tossed out of the good school, even if it leaves that school with no black kids. Diversity initiatives where you can't punish a black kid until you also punish a white kid- even if the white kid did nothing wrong, can go suck my nuts).

>how else can we compete with China and India as they catch up to our per capita productivity?).

International Embargo on human rights abuses, environmental issues, or The planet *cannot ecologically sustain* China and India developing on the backs of fossil fuels. Really, ""Pick a reason,"" the realpolitik is it would fuck up that productivity, and fuck the bloodsucking corporations sideways, tanking every western and eastern country's GDP as they rebuild their economies and production- and this time, inside countries that have meaningful regulatory agencies that can manage emissions laws and will be well-funded thanks to the higher tax rate.

This also has a positive effect in reducing CO2 emissions as we see supply chains shorten, bunker-fuel-burning shipping container vessels be used less.

I'd also cease all foreign aid to Sub-Saharan Africa to slow its population growth, and I would Irish Potato Famine the entire continent.

>I'm baffled why you'd want to shrink the labor pool. Even without the free market providing adequate employment it should be trivial to make a gov program to put idle hands to work on, e.g., stopping environmental collapse (with funds coming from current wealth surpluses of the ultrarich).

A shrunken labor pool lends itself to higher wages for the working class that aren't artificially high or ""high in number of dollars paid, low in value."" This gives the power to the worker, rather than the government, to determine their own career paths, and almost regardless of choice it would be financially rewarding enough to earn a pension and retire on, assuming the labor pool was shrunken enough down.

> I'd like to have an effectively global workforce with low barriers of entry for getting a basic living wage job almost anywhere and globally widespread liberal values.

I'm starting to think you don't understand workers very well. Have you worked in a warehouse, or a trade, or a blue collar job? I've done both non-union and union jobs, and worked my way to the professional class. The barrier to entry is low for skilled professions in part because the cultural differences are fairly negligible. There's this ""internationalist"" mindset where it's almost a hivemind of ""immigration is great, I get better tacos!"" because that's the full limit of how it affects their lives. Let me tell you now: The very vast majority of workers are not so lucky, nor so keen to either immigrate or suffer immigration's negative effects so that the internationalist class gets tacos."

Ah. Out here McDonald's is generally minimum wage, around $7-$8 an hour, depending on state. Worse, almost everything is- storeroom stocker, warehouse worker, delivery driver (assuming it isn't gig-economied out), gardener, clerk, data entry, and even entry-level skilled labor jobs and even skilled labor jobs (HTML/Front End, phonebanking, and entry-level coding jobs) pay about that much in the USA if you're not in Silicon Valley or at the top-end of the profession.

No, they're already doing jobs like ""wiring homes"" which by law *must* be performed by licensed electricians. If we hire and train all 27 million illegal immigrants to be electricians, electricians will soon earn $7 an hour, and Americans will no longer train to become Electricians. We enact stiff penalties to employers for shortcutting on this, which is why Electricians still can earn a *decent* wage, but it's getting hard for them to find steady work.

We made them legal in the '80s. Lots of jobs that they were already working (there was no check on if they were actually in agriculture) had the wages enter a period of absolute freefall, and caused the stampede of ""first generation college student"" and demand for federally backed loans- and the student debt crisis we see today.

Let’s try this again. 

“If you train them-“ 

If we train 25 million new “qualified welders”, what happens to the value/wage a welder (a “skilled trade”) can demand? There’s an estimated 25 million illegal immigrants in America, by MIT/Harvard’s count, and that number is likely up to 27 million by now if WaPo’s “1million net arrivals per year” estimate is accurate.

This isn’t a bug, This is the basis of Greenspanian economic theory- that ‘working skilled labor’ is overpaid by paying a living wage, and that paying a decent wage prevents corporations from investing that money to growth. The ideal is to be directing spending away from wages and toward investment/making it so they can hire two engineers for the cost of one, or put it toward profits, or toward a merger.

The problem though is that soon the wage is what a McDonald’s employee is making, and no one wants to be a welder. Then we say ‘it’s just a job Americans don’t want to do,’ and levy congress for third world people to take the job, even though it used to be done by Americans, because it once paid a living wage before we undercut it.

We certainly used to tend the farms, work construction, do landscaping, and so on. It used to pay a living wage.

>> If you want I can make a whole writeup for why IQ tests are extremely unreliable.

If you stick someone who is an extreme outlier with an IQ of 150 into a village of people with an average IQ of 65, you're not going to build as great or developed of a society as if you take someone with an IQ of 130 where the average villager IQ is 95. 

Generally this argument of ""IQ isn't a perfect metric of individual intellectual aptitude-"" but it rather is. The counterargument typically arrives at a point where someone says: ""okay but can mister IQ 150 survive in an arid desert if we dropped him into it right now?"" which is to say that the IQ is ""not practical knowledge/'street smart'.""

For all the ""Magical Negro"" and ""Noble Savage"" stereotypes that get applied to the various subsaharan African people by white liberals, the truth is that African levels of technological development is pitiable, their grasp of politics, labor, and so on is quite poor, even when given exposure to higher levels of political theater.
