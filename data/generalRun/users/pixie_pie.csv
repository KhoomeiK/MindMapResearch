This sums it up. Very well put!"
mildlyinfuriating,ff6aj0u,t1_ff5vn58,1579622941.0,This goes in the same category as the tea bag thingy sinking to the bottom of the cup. And it's a green tea.

I've seen a girl on a flight in the seat before me, trying to do small talk on the first leg of a 14h flight. Thankfully she didn't sit next to me."

I'm thinking of switching back to my old ones. The times I'm actually in a good mood and be happy answer their questions, people get annoyed that I don't immediately respond as I don't hear them and that it takes about 0.5sec to turn off my headphones."
todayilearned,ff66poq,t1_ff5thsn,1579620445.0,"That's so nice to hear this acknowledged. Please tell it to your patients like this. So many Drs leave it at that and the patient alone with it, so it feels like it's the patient's ""fault""."
prettyuglylittleliars,ff5xvt7,t1_ff5ncrq,1579613828.0,This is so annoying. I'd really like to know what's going on.

prettyuglylittleliars,femla6z,t3_eov4ch,1579261150.0,I find the lack of acknowledgement whenver the site came back up kind of interesting. There was never a post about it mentioning the reasons or users asking about it. It's like nothing happened. That's why I thought for a while it was me.

ABraThatFits,fdq37by,t1_fdq2y57,1578652643.0,"I'd love to know, too. The chance is high they aren't a dad. On good days it's not annoying, but funny? Eh... No. 

The common misspellings bot is equally annoying. Fortunately I haven't seen that one in a while."
muji,fdq0v0z,t3_emnt6l,1578649300.0,"I love the essential oils, scented candles and stationary products! The erasable pens have changed my life. That's the only thing I use for highlighting in books. For the essential oils, I've tried many other brands and I still like most of Muji best. Especially the orange oil.

What I personally wouldn't get are the diffusors. They're definitely overpriced. You can find almost copies on eBay and Amazon. I had one that was probably the model Muji sold (it was around $35) that only had the white light but I broke after less than a year. I have only found the ones the colored leds since then. Maybe Muji had them purged."

That is one thing, but the gym is not a public space. The reasoning behind it might not match your own point of view but that's the way it is in most gyms. As I said it's not a public space and one should be able to expect that they're not filmed. Safety is one of those reasons. While it's not the most common reason, it's a valid one."
