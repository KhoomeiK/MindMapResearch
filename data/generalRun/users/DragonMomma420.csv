I don't like the fact that you have not made better plans, waited until you didn't have to lie, or you know  ACTUALLY RESPECT the questions that you will be asked because it is the parents right to question you up and down about your motives with their daughter.

There is no such thing as a nonsense question when YOU WANT TO TAKE THEIR DAUGHTER OUT OF THE COUNTRY!

Just because the girl trusts you doesn't  mean her parents have to. You really don't understand how a parent/child relationship works.

I lied to my gram (who raised me) once. I went to a friends house with the plans to go to a party in the woods. My gram trusted my friend, and we never did anything to make my gram not trust us, until that night. I was at the party and some girls got drugged, the cops were called and it took forever to earn my grandmother's trust again.

I never said I would stop him, doesn't mean I can't ask all the questions I want. As parents, we have that right.

I don't have a girl, glad I didn't  because if she met a guy like you, I would keep her from leaving on a trip with you, regardless of her age.

I raised him and if he is still living with me, I have every right to ask and put in my two sense. That is my right as a parent, until the day I die.



And parents (of girls) get worried because sex leads to babies, and most boys of 18 are not parental material, so some tough conversations have to happen with the girl and her parents.
