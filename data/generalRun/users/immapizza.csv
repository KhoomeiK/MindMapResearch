insaneparents,feqop8w,t1_fekdfxi,1579344310.0,"I’m 19 and I still run it by my parents when I plan to stay at my boyfriends house, mostly because my mom has health problems and can end up in the hospital at any moment so I prefer to at least let them know where I’ll be if anything happens. I ask her if she’s okay with me going to hopefully let her know it’s okay to say she wants me to stay home in case she’s not feeling well. She occasionally is bed bound and needs help doing things like cooking and such, and I prefer being home to help her. It also helps for my dad to know where I am in case he needs me to come home if something happens with her or he needs my help.

On the other hand, I just tell my parents where I’ll be in case something happens to me. I want them to know where I intend to be in case I don’t make it there or make it back."

I lost my oldest brother a few years ago and after his death it seems my mom has lost the desire to exist as well. Just.. She's here because she has to be, not because she wants to be. I have been scared of the grief killing her, given her already bad health.

I'm suicidal myself and every time I've gotten to the point of considering an attempt, one of the few things that pulls me back from the edge is the idea of causing my mother more pain. Her losing her oldest and then her youngest damn well might kill her and if it doesnt, she would want it to. I can't do that to her."

pics,fegon1o,t1_fegoi56,1579098851.0,You’re literally refusing to accept that this isn’t nearly as bad as you make it out to seem. He has every right to take pictures with his dying wife. He has every right to share them if that’s how he finds his peace. You can’t assume she’d be against it. You’re just refusing to be a respectful person and it’s sad. You’re sad. You don’t have to like it but at least be a decent human and have respect.

pics,fegnvfo,t1_fegnsqo,1579098295.0,The karma people are accusing him of seeking is reddit karma. Internet points. Don’t act like they’re trying at all to insinuate he’s seeking good karma when you know that’s not what it means.

pics,feghqb1,t1_feghdcz,1579093131.0,"You don’t have to feel anything- nor does making you cringe mean that he’s wrong for posting this. If posting it automatically makes it attention seeking, then there’s a damn large amount of people seeking attention out there for how they choose to grieve.

Regardless of how you feel, be respectful. Don’t accuse him of seeking karma."
pics,feggjxe,t1_feggfkf,1579092038.0,"He is not on his phone- he’s holding it. Do you realize how much communication is done with family and friends in a time like this? Not surprising he has his phone in hand. And yes, I would take photos. I would be using my phone. I’d be updating loved ones throughout the day and have my phone handy for when I might need it. I’d want photos to document our life together- from beginning to end. Yes, I’d likely pose as well. Not every photo must be a candid shot. Posing is okay. Timers are okay. He isn’t doing anything wrong and you are by no means required to like his choice or think it’s okay, but assuming it’s for karma is fucked up. Have more respect, that’s all."
pics,fegfxrg,t1_fegfrw6,1579091439.0,"The way they are responding is the issue- they have every right to not like that he posted this, but to accuse him of seeking karma is just a fucked up statement. Of course he’ll receive that spectrum- but we have every right to call people out for it as well. They could, at the very least, have more respect. Sucks that they don’t."
pics,fegfnrm,t1_fegfjcl,1579091169.0,"Ah yes, continue to assume it’s for karma. Lovely argument you all have. What do you expect it to be? Him sobbing, clutching his wife? It’s not all emotional. It’s not going to be what you expect. It doesn’t even look like he’s posing- he’s just sitting there. It looks as candid as the rest of his photos. He’s sitting, holding his phone and looking off in the distance. People pose with dying family members all the time, anyway. How is posing bad?

To go off of the “he’s posing so it’s for karma” theme: have you seen photos of parents with their passed children? Whether stillborn or not, they pose in their last photos. Cradle them close, or just sit by their bedside. That’s what he’s doing- sitting beside her. What exactly about that makes this seem like it’s for karma?"
pics,fegf7cv,t1_fegf0kn,1579090710.0,"Exactly. Drug abuse and alcoholism are some of the darkest places I’ve seen people dive to during grief. Some never come back, some cause grief for others when they end up passing from their addictions as well. Grief can be handled differently- both good and bad. This way might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but it’s real and raw and a way better choice than others make in the face of loss. I’ve seen people grieve for a day and then take their life because it was too much. Get addicted to heroin. Drink themselves to death. By all means, posting photos of your wife to show the internet what this is like is not the worst way to handle loss. He’s finding his peace and he’s reaching out for support and spreading awareness. It’s his way to grieve, and people should accept that whether they like it or not he isn’t harming anyone."
pics,fegexpk,t1_fegeux1,1579090429.0,"How are you all so sure that it’s for attention? How do you know it’s for karma? The question goes both ways, bud. Many people post about these things for support."
pics,fegew7y,t1_fegesjr,1579090386.0,"It truly astounds me how many people are putting him down for his choice in grieving. No, you don’t have to like it, but he doesn’t need to keep it private either. Let him find his peace however he can."
pics,fegeo88,t1_fege2wf,1579090152.0,"Everyone is different. Many will document the last moments of their loved ones. There’s a whole sub for it. Everyone copes and grieves in their own way and a choice to document and share these photos is purely up to the feelings of the person grieving. Not everyone will be strong enough to or feel comfortable doing so, others are."
pics,fegekam,t1_fegec3i,1579090032.0,"It’s not for karma, it’s for support. You assume it’s for karma- why? Because he posted it? Where in this post do you see him beg for karma? Ask for upvotes? Not a soul is obligated to upvote this post just like he’s not obligated to not post it. It’s his way of accepting his situation and to show others what it’s like. Please by all means disagree in silence. Don’t assume this is for karma. Thanks."
pics,fegeh76,t1_fege8mw,1579089936.0,"If you didn’t ask for it, keep scrolling. By no means are you one to dictate what is and is not okay for someone else to post regarding their life and the grief they are going through. This is his way of showing people the pain he’s dealing with and to find support for it. You and the others agreeing don’t like it- that’s fine. But to call it tasteless or say it’s a karma grab is wrong. Sure, it’s morbid. Sure, it’s not something most want to see. But it’s such a common and accepted way of coping that there’s a whole subreddit for it. For last moments. For sharing those photos of the last moments your loved one spent here on earth. It’s not your cup of tea- but it’s his, and it’s someone else’s, and you don’t have to bring negativity into it by saying it’s wrong that he does it. By all means, disagree with his decisions, but you go on about how bad he is for it and for what? Why do you get from it? Gratification when people agree? He needs support, if you can’t provide then simply keep going on with your life- but you don’t need to tell him he’s wrong for his decision to post these things."
pics,fege5ur,t1_fegdabp,1579089584.0,"This is far from tasteless. This is sharing the last moments with the love of his life, documenting it for the world to see. It’s raw. It’s painful and yes it’s morbid, but it’s his life and it’s hers. The last of the life they’ll share in this earthly realm. He wants people to see that when you truly love someone, you’ll be there til the end. Its a keepsake of their last moment. It’s not something he’s obligated to keep private. It’s not tasteless just because it’s not your cup of tea."
pics,fege02g,t1_fegdoua,1579089402.0,"Asking for karma or just wishing to share what it’s like living the last days you’ll ever have with the love of your life? It’s not uncommon to document the end of life of people you care for, nor to share them. A man got a lot of attention for his photo set of his wife’s battle with cancer from beginning to end, ending with a photo of her empty bed after she passed. You saw her deteriorate, you saw her unable to leave her bed, you saw her last day. It was real and it was raw and it showed the emotion and love they shared. It showcased the love she had for her family and the love they had for her in return. It showed the life of loving someone with terminal cancer. It was not a grab for attention or karma, simply a way to document that period of their life together, the last period they’d have."
