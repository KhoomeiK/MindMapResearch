seduction,ffj6oa8,t1_ffecmkt,1579991747.0,well then they have low standards and it’s a relationship that won’t last more than a couple months. You have to be offering some kind of value as a man. Plus I just wouldn’t feel good about myself thinking I’m good enough to date a women if I have a mediocre job. Your occupation is a moderate part of what defines you as a person.
selfimprovement,ffha54a,t1_ffc0i75,1579927596.0,Straight up.
selfimprovement,ffh0lg3,t1_ffbnsp3,1579919902.0,Yes..? What does it look like to you?
selfimprovement,ffdpczw,t1_ffdhhxx,1579825788.0,It doesn’t mean I should rant on reddit though
selfimprovement,ffd3288,t1_ffd16r2,1579812446.0,Thank you
selfimprovement,ffd0t08,t1_ffcrau3,1579811176.0,jackass
selfimprovement,ffcz92a,t1_ffcxoru,1579810316.0,I’m just bitter and I’m trying to change that
selfimprovement,ffcw9ql,t1_ffcvoyt,1579808587.0,Thanks captain obvious I can see that
selfimprovement,ffcuv0q,t1_ffcuopl,1579807730.0,Get help. Asap
selfimprovement,ffcuk35,t1_ffctr7f,1579807553.0,"Don’t do that, at least. I’m not saying to kill yourself and I will never advocate for that"
selfimprovement,ffcr0zn,t1_ffbz6wq,1579805467.0,Because that’s when confidence needs to come in to play and I struggle with that as well. And I’m certain having goals would not make any difference
selfimprovement,ffcphw1,t1_ffcl7jp,1579804451.0,"It was like 3 am. I’m gonna shower and then going to the gym. BACK TO WORK, SAILOR"

selfimprovement,ffcp42b,t1_ffcaazn,1579804203.0,I’ve heard this drivel for a decade and I’m still single so I’m gonna have to call bs
selfimprovement,ffcp2a6,t1_ffc9szu,1579804172.0,Yeah. At this point it’s not looking like it’s gonna happen tbh
selfimprovement,ffcp056,t1_ffc3me9,1579804135.0,I would hardly say society is not doing ANYTHING. There very much is a suppressed view that being single is somehow worse than being in a relationship

seduction,ffazm54,t1_ff6mk8p,1579748177.0,You’re quite young. Trying being in that exact same situation but in your late twenties lol. I’m working on myself but in terms of women I’ve borderline given up. You have to offer them some kind of value. Period.
seduction,ffawqh6,t1_ff8byvd,1579746268.0,"I really hate to say it, but I would say no. I just have standards for myself. Like “wattaya doin’ bringing home a girl you ain’t even got yo licence yet lmao.“"

seduction,ff5vrgb,t1_ff5uq9l,1579611910.0,"I just can’t make up my mind. One minute I’m confident, remembering all the compliments I’ve gotten from females, and the next I’m feeling completely hopeless"
seduction,ff5ucd6,t1_ff5rk14,1579610537.0,Who am I kidding. I’m a lost cause and I should just give up
selfimprovement,ff5rdp4,t1_ff28kqc,1579607257.0,Close. Xenoblade Chronicles for Wii. Although Riki did make an appearance in later smash games as an assist trophy.  As well as Shulk’s final smash
