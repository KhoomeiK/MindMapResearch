Finally broke down during an argument just sitting there crying, begging him to talk to me, to say anything, then giving up completely because everything he said was designed to hurt me and shut me up, and then he'd go back to ignoring me.

AmItheAsshole,ff45dr8,t3_erfvwt,1579555909.0,"NTA. What it sounds like to me is that your sister never actually *asked* to use the dress, and you never actually *agreed.* She TOLD you she would be using it, and assumed that would be okay. Now that you've done something necessary for your emotional healing, she has the audacity to be angry because it's *inconvenient* to her. 

She doesn't have the right to use the dress just because you didn't,  it's incredibly selfish of her to assume she could use it in the first place, and ESPECIALLY selfish of her to say that you were wrong for taking care of yourself. Doesn't sound like she gave any thought at all to what the dress means to *you,* the owner. 

Additionally, if she can't afford an expensive dress, that's not your problem. You don't need an expensive dress to get married, and if she's shallow enough to care more about the price tag than the actual dress, I'm surprised she wants your secondhand one anyways."

AskWomen,ff1telk,t3_eqxs0f,1579485766.0,"My mother came from a weord and unsupportive family. She raised me to be open-minded, and made sure I could come to her with anything. Obviously if I did something wrong, I don't want to tell her, and I'm terrified of disappointing her. But that's because I want her to be proud and know that she did a good job raising me, because I love her and care what she thinks; *not* because I was raised to be afraid of her reaction"

tumblr,fex2smb,t1_fevg6y1,1579423370.0,"When I was 9, my grandmother had a thing for sno-balls. It's a little cake thing surrounded by marshmallow and covered in some sort of sprinkles. She ate them warm. So she asks me to heat one up for her, and I asked her how long to put it in for. She said ""twenty.""

Sidenote: we were in a motel, and I was unfamiliar with this microwave, which had a dial to set the time instead of buttons.

So I turned the dial to twenty. She didn't specify *seconds*, so I didn't think to check and make sure it was 20 seconds. A few minutes later, we realize it's still going, because I actually set it for 20 *minutes* by mistake, and completely melted all the marshmallow parts and the styrofoam plate it was on"

She cheated on you, you have no romantic obligation. 

Let's ignore that, and go for the angle that because you're more fortunate, you should help the less fortunate. She has lied to you, gone behind your back, and attempted to manipulate you. Why would you trust her to ""borrow"" anything, much less a significant sum of money?"

Next thing I know she's acting like it's all my idea and yelling at me about how stressed out she is over it and it's all my fault. 

Then I found out she was lying about me behind my back, using me as a scapegoat to weasel out of judgement and uncomfortable situations.
