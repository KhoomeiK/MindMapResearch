What helped me was an exercise that is basically me wishing myself good things and saying good things about myself. If it seems hard, start with maybes.

Example: ""Maybe I deserve to be happier."" ""I might deserve rest when I needed."" ""Needs of others are probably not more important than my needs."" Basically whatever you need to put there.

Unless you are dying, no one really cares what's going on with you. Once I was traveling alone and I started having huge stomach pains. Like, ""can't stand straight"" painful. I had a lot of trouble getting out of the train and I threw up into the nearest trash can. Then I sort of ""shimmied"" holding a wall with both hands, half crouching, just so I would manage to get on my next train and be on the way home.

blackmirror,fea8eqp,t1_fea2h4e,1578945579.0,"I'm glad you don't think that way, honestly. Sorry if I was too harsh, it just seemed really... concerning... to read that someone agreed with or felt with a guy pointing a gun at someone completely innocent and even expected others to feel the same.

Lack of intent to kill doesn't negate potentially killing him.

Though, I don't think that Chris actually believed what he was saying. I mean, if he truly honestly believed he was at fault, why was he pointing a gun at someone? Maybe he had a death wish (most likely) that that kind of behavior shows obvious lack of consideration of possible outcome (which is very obviously his issue). But that's something you do cognitively not intuitively. Which means that he genuinely didn't care.

Honestly, no, I don't feel bad when a fictional messed up person dies. I don't even feel bad when a fictional character I don't care for dies. If that should show desensitisation, it's doomed to fail because it's fictional. No one got hurt in the making of that episode (hopefully).

But should people really feel bad when someone holding someone else at a gunpoint for no reason dies? My opinion is no. If you do feel bad over that, you are very empathetic but being less empathetic doesn't make you wrong. You don't have to feel with every single human out there, that's exhausting and paints a really bleak future for you.

But that's not social media desensitising us, that's information putting things into perspective. Death is a part of life, it can be unfortunate and sad but it's not inherently wrong. Thinking that every single death is terrifying would just destroy you when someone you know dies. And they will die.

Sure, Chris' life was sad but he messed up several people to what... make a point? If it was real, I wouldn't feel bad for his death. I would be glad he didn't hurt anyone else.

The film Er ist wieder da (Look Who's Back) made this point way better. It's about Hitler travelling into future and basically taking the social media by a storm by being... well... himself. If you like this theme, I absolutely recommend that film but it's extremely unsettling in how real it feels. In how the people going against him are ignored or dismissed to make more money and how his ideology grows on people even those directly affected by it. It's the most terrifying comedy I've ever seen.

If you do watch it, send me a message, I'm curious what you think of it."
joker,fea29pr,t1_fea1lke,1578943635.0,Are you reacting to the correct comment? Because it seems unrelated to it.
blackmirror,fe9y0ij,t3_eo4o0i,1578942459.0,"It seems odd that you group all viewers into social media addicts and somehow make them relate to Chris?

If you feel like Smithereens is about you, you have a huge problem. Not just an addiction problem but accepting responsibility for your actions problem. It's easy to blame others or the world for your mistakes and your lack of control.

Out of all Black Mirror episodes, this one made me feel with the ""main character"" the least. Or rather, I felt MUCH more with Billy and Jaden than I could with Chris. Chris is a mad man who blames everyone but himself for his mistakes. He's so willing to reject any responsibility for his own actions that he would point a gun at an innocent person and threaten to kill him just so he can talk with someone. Seriously, if you don't consider this extremely messed up, you need to really deeply rethink it.

And why I feel with Billy? He was a man with a vision, a man with a goal who worked for his goal and achieved it. And now, people are blaming him for their mistakes. For their addictions. Even though this isn't what he made, this wasn't his goal. A mad man threatening to kill his employee, someone whose life rests on Billy's shoulders, is blaming him for everything wrong in his life. And then there are people who agree with that. Who also blame him while using the very platform he created. This is what he sees every day, people blaming him for terrible and painful things that they did or caused. No wonder the dude needs a no-network break, that would drive me mad in a month.

But I cannot feel with Chris. He's a monster who portrays himself as a victim of society. He thinks he's the Joker but he's more of Penguin. A man responsible for his own downfall, who drags others down with him. I would feel with Chris if he wasn't holding a gun at a guy's face. Addiction/mistake costing the life of your family is a terrible situation that messed up a person. It's something so easily avoidable and yet it wasn't. However, the moment he pointed a gun at someone just to tell someone else that he blames him? He maybe gave PTSD to at least 2 people involved in the situation. I don't know about you, but if I were Billy, I'd shit my pants every time my phone rang unexpectedly. What if it's another madman holding another of my employees at a gun point? What if I say something wrong and he shoots him? What does he even want me to say?   

No, social media aren't responsible for your lack of control or for you risking life of you and your family if you text/call while driving. Corporations aren't to blame for the time you waste on it.

The only emotion I felt for Chris while watching was disgust and terror at the idea that there are people who actually think this way and think they're right.

You are jumping to conclusions again and I didn't write he wasn't eating, he just wasn't eating treats, he was eating hay and pellets normally.

I'm not going to respond to you anymore, I just hope you treat your pets better than you treat people."
chinchilla,fduwawj,t3_emvrwk,1578739925.0,"I deleted this post because most people instead of helping attack me. To get some facts straight:

1. Yes, I had to travel with my chinchillas, I'm glad if you have someone to watch them every day over the holidays but I don't. The travel was by a heated car, they had food and water available and it was timed during they sleep time to cut down on the stress as much as possible. They slept through the entire travel, both ways.

2. I'm not going to rush to the vet over every single minor issue. Chinchillas are sensitive and it's cold outside. I can't park inside the doctor's office and even if I cover the carrier I doubt the cold won't get in and I also doubt that getting repeatedly touched over his entire body for 15-30 minutes is relaxing for a chinchilla. If the cause is stress, more stress is not going to help. Not to mention this was recommend by the person I got them from, no rushing to the vet unless the issue is major: weight drops more than 50g, they stop eating/drinking/dropping, get hurt or the issue lasts more than 3 days. None of those was true in this case.

3. I'm not dismissing any issue. They are weighted every day so I can track the changes and react accordingly. The issue with smaller droppings was for 2 days. I've been watching how much they eat, how much they drink, I'm not leaving anything to a chance.

4. The issue didn't seem to get better last night and since the only helpful post in this thread raised some valid concerns, I went to the vet with him today and he's healthy. I got vitamins and was told to watch that he's eating and if there are any issues to call. He already gained weight and his droppings grew. I'm still glad I went as I was concerned he could have teeth trouble as well but that's also non-issue.

5. This is the most judgemental and hostile community I've seen in Reddit yet. People immediately start attacking, being unhelpful, judgemental, jump to conclusions and react to things that a. weren't even written in the past b. aren't true. If you really believe that someone who doesn't care for their pets will go asking for advice right away when they see an issue? If you di, you need a serious reality check. Overall, I'm very disappointed in the amount of hate I got for asking for advice. You can be sure that this is the first and last time I'm ever posting here and I honestly hope you treat your pets better than you treat people because if not, they're screwed."
chinchilla,fdutr7o,t1_fdthvxv,1578738695.0,"I wanted to know if it could be something more serious. There was no change in his behavior and he ate and drank (though less than usually).

The person I got them from, when I got them specifically said not to rush to vet right away unless there is a big weight loss (50g), they stop eating or dropping.

None of those was true, so I didn't want to put him through more stress than necessary. I didn't realise his digestive system could get into stasis (which is why I was asking in the first place) and since it didn't get better in 2 days, I went to the vet, just in case.

He's healthy, I received some vitamins that seems to taste him and he already gained weight and his droppings are a bit bigger. The doctor said I don't have to be concerned and that the weight loss was due to travel.

She gave him a complete check up, including teeth, and he's alright.

I will watch him today and watch his weight daily this week."
chinchilla,fdusl4f,t1_fduqima,1578738159.0,"How did I fail? He's alright. You seem to be dead set that he's dying or something. At the vet they weighted him and he already gained. Total loss was 30g, over the course of last few days he lost 2g per day. I was told by numerous people that it's not concerning when there were changes.

Yes, I deleted it because instead of helping people jump to attacking and judging without knowing the situation. I don't need this in my life. It was the first and last advice I posted here and it saddens me that people are unwilling to help and instead jump to conclusions and attack those who want the best for their pets.

I'm glad you have people who can help you but there was no one to look after them. Leaving them alone was out of the question. What was I supposed to do? Stay entire Christmas with Chinchillas because heaven forbid they lose 1g?

Yes, if having 2 healthy Chinchillas and ensuring they are doing well is failure then I failed."

He seems to be healthy. They told me his weight loss is likely due to the stress and it's not major. He already gained some weight and his droppings are bigger. I received some vitamins and was told to watch him and to call them if there is an issue.

I don't see why he would have respiratory issues, other than small droppings and weight loss (I honestly don't understand why you think I'm writing it off, I've weighting them every day since I returned) he's normal.

Trust Bob when he says he feels miserable for going no contact and also that going no contact was probably what he needed. He most likely didn't mean to ghost you or to hurt you or to be a drama queen.

The only thing that helps me is forced socialising. Ironically enough, when I want to go out the least, it's when I do socially best and it usually feels really good afterwards.

But people like this shouldn't be shunned from the only places that can help them."
Atypical,fcjzgch,t1_fcjwbq0,1577711628.0,"What are you taking about? People go to concerts with their friends and it was pretty clear Doug wasn't in love with that chick. Just look how fast be backtracked from that concert. He was even surprised how jealous Elsa acted but seemed happy or content that she cared for him and obviously wants to work on the issues.

Elsa doesn't get monopoly on Doug's free time just because they're married. Sure, the chick was totally into Doug and was trying to seduce him but I never felt it was returned in any aspect. He liked her as a friend and colleague."
aspergers,fcjyotq,t3_ehjsck,1577710774.0,"This is my two cents as someone who's officially NT. I'm not diagnosed and I don't pretend to be. I barely post here but when I do it's for issues that I relate to or I have experienced.

I could either have ASD or HSP + GAD + SAD + some form of light depression + personality quirks or Schizotypal/Schizoid PDs or anything with similar symptoms. Still, my ""issues"" are very similar to ASD and it helps immensely to have support and not feel alone, especially since so few people can get it. I was told I was likely on the spectrum by 3 people independently of each other and out of those one was diagnosed, one has a friend on the spectrum and one works with people with special needs.

Just learning about ASD has helped me a lot already because I've been pushing myself insanely towards burnt out, I was stressed out every day and couldn't sleep well and, now, I finally started respecting my own issues with bright lights, loud sounds/noise, physical contact, repetitive movements and certain rigidity with rules and my own quirks. I started focusing less on being normal and started doing the things that make me happy/less uncomfortable. All of my friends already know me as the weirdo who is inappropriate at times but doesn't mean it badly so being a little bit weirder does no harm but makes me much calmer and content.

Still, I wouldn't claim I was on the spectrum as I wasn't officially diagnosed and so there's no certainty of that. However, I also acknowledge that I will most likely never be diagnosed as it requires a family member but none of mine would go because they think only lunatics go to psychiatrists.

I'm sorry if anyone feels like I shouldn't be here or that I'm stealing your places or something along the lines. I feel off here as well because I don't want to intrude and I have no relevant diagnosis but I also need support and to know I'm not pathetic and selfish or intentionally not understanding or unable to get over slight discomforts like everyone else."

There's misguided and there's ripping a hole in reality which you were warned about and no one wants you to do because a friend dumped you after you tried to kill her multiple times.

People usually have a grater justification for atrocities than ""it's fun"". Almost no one considers themselves the villain of the story. People do what they do because they believe it's right, or at least it's not wrong.

Your definition of evil would apply to about 1% of crimes.

Anxiety,fc9jan0,t1_fc9bfb9,1577553494.0,"Personally, it helped me to describe it as it is but simplifying it. For example in your case I would say ""I can go but recently I've been having headaches often and I need to have quiet and dark sometimes.""

I mean, having issues with overstimulation shouldn't stop you from having fun. My mom also doesn't understand me but the more I've been pressuring and making steps to meet her halfway the more accepting she is. It didn't happen right away but over time, she got from ""If there are people here you have to be present at all times!"" to ""You look stressed out, you should say you have a headache and stay in your room until they leave.""

My advice is keep explaining and simplifying. They mean no harm, they legitimately don't understand.

I'm not sure if it helps but in any case, good luck!"
Anxiety,fc84yfq,t3_egkgv0,1577526979.0,"Did you tell them? Not many people understand this so it's possible they mean no harm but want to know what's going on.

Try to tell them beforehand, at the start of the gathering that you suffer from migraines and it's possible that if it hits, you will end some quiet time in dark and that speaking makes the migraine worse.

Most people understand what a migraine feels like and are very likely to give you space if you need it."
