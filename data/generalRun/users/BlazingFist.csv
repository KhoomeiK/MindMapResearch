Then SciTE will be able to go to the next line within the F12 code chunk and I can debug from there.  Having only used VBA before and the built in IDE for that in Excel I didn't really think to try that lol.  Thought it would just go line by line as needed.

Also I was thinking that, since I was already running the code that I was currently debugging, that if I pressed F12 it would automatically actually perform the code, bypassing the IDE.

I suppose that's alright since I'm not really a car guy and it would have taken me a lot longer to try to figure out how to change them than someone in the shop who works with cars every day.  When working on cars is your job, you have to put a lot of time and effort into learning how to do things like basic car maintenance and changing windshield wipers.  I never really had much interest in auto-mechanics though, so it really shouldn't surprise anybody that I had someone else change my windshield wipers for me.

todayilearned,fe6g3as,t1_fe6erk7,1578889838.0,"Thank you for examples, but your articles don't appear to contradict what I said from how I'm reading it/interpreting it.

The first article has as a headline, ""US strike targeting Taliban commander causes civilian casualties"".  Later in the article, it mentions both wounded and killed.  However, without a specific number to compare to the headline, the point is moot.  To me, that headline reads as ""US strike targeting Taliban commander causes civilian deaths"".  I highly doubt that headline would have included the word ""casualties"" in it if there were only injuries, and not deaths.

The second headline, ""Two rockets explode near US Embassy in Baghdad with no casualties"".  I'm not sure what you're getting at here.  There were no deaths (or even injuries that I can see in the article) from the rockets.  The headline is fine to me?

If you said a plane crashed and everyone on board was a casualty, would your first thought be that everybody died, or just that everybody on board received a minor injury?  Or maybe that 1 person died and everybody else had a minor injury?  Journalists and news outlets, from my reading, have used the word fatality less and less, and casualty has taken its place to mean the same thing.  That's why it ticks me off when people disagree that language changes.  When a word becomes commonly used to describe something different than its original meaning then its meaning has changed."

I had to create a monstrosity using notepad at my previous job for the same reason that I used for parsing invoices and collecting all the relevant information to then automatically put into our invoicing system.  Debugging was not fun, and basically involved putting in msgboxes at various points in my code to read what values my variables had."
AutoHotkey,ff282ot,t1_ff25n8k,1579496525.0,"Hey, thanks for the response.  After playing with it some more I figured it out.  It's as simple as actually pressing F12 once I get there.  Then SciTE will be able to go to the next line within the F12 code chunk and I can debug from there.  Having only used VBA before and the built in IDE for that in Excel I didn't really think to try that lol.  Thought it would just go line by line as needed.

Also I was thinking that, since I was already running the code that I was currently debugging, that if I pressed F12 it would automatically actually perform the code, bypassing the IDE.  Looks like SciTE stops it from running though, letting you debug it line by line without actually activating the hotkey."

I suppose that's alright since I'm not really a car guy and it would have taken me a lot longer to try to figure out how to change them than someone in the shop who works with cars every day.  When working on cars is your job, you have to put a lot of time and effort into learning how to do things like basic car maintenance and changing windshield wipers.  I never really had much interest in auto-mechanics though, so it really shouldn't surprise anybody that I had someone else change my windshield wipers for me.  I wouldn't want to screw something up after all.).

todayilearned,fe6g3as,t1_fe6erk7,1578889838.0,"Thank you for examples, but your articles don't appear to contradict what I said from how I'm reading it/interpreting it.

The first article has as a headline, ""US strike targeting Taliban commander causes civilian casualties"".  Later in the article, it mentions both wounded and killed.  However, without a specific number to compare to the headline, the point is moot.  To me, that headline reads as ""US strike targeting Taliban commander causes civilian deaths"".  I highly doubt that headline would have included the word ""casualties"" in it if there were only injuries, and not deaths.

The second headline, ""Two rockets explode near US Embassy in Baghdad with no casualties"".  I'm not sure what you're getting at here.  There were no deaths (or even injuries that I can see in the article) from the rockets.  The headline is fine to me?

If you said a plane crashed and everyone on board was a casualty, would your first thought be that everybody died, or just that everybody on board received a minor injury?  Or maybe that 1 person died and everybody else had a minor injury?  Journalists and news outlets, from my reading, have used the word fatality less and less, and casualty has taken its place to mean the same thing.  That's why it ticks me off when people disagree that language changes.  When a word becomes commonly used to describe something different than its original meaning then its meaning has changed."

I've played more and found out that the progress screen tells you what certain perks and spells do and such after you've bought them and used them once, and also that you can hold down to drink any liquid (the game tells you nowhere you can do this).
