Coffee,ffbfh9z,t1_feek3z8,1579762997.0,"I believe I’ve had Bella Donovan and it was pretty good, but still kind of acidic. I don’t remember. I’ll give it another shot."
Coffee,ffbff6b,t1_fefbygp,1579762928.0,Thanks! Yeah SF seems to be full of the fruity stuff. I’ve tried Stumptown and had the same experience with most of the things I’ve tried. I’ll keep looking.
Coffee,ffbfd0x,t1_fef2s9i,1579762859.0,"Nice, I’ll check out! Thanks!"
Coffee,ffbfbwp,t1_fef0477,1579762823.0,Haha yes! I am weird in plenty of other ways. Thanks for clarifying the realities of it all :)
Coffee,ffbf9is,t1_feeyyky,1579762745.0,"Thank you! It’s readily available at a bunch of stores near me. I’m going to try it! I like that it’s organic too. All the coffee I drink over time, might be good to get something organic. It’s a great price too at just under $12. 

How do you brew your 46?

I’m finishing a bag of Cafe Domingo from Peet’s. It’s actually quite good, but slightly flat in taste when it’s just black."
Coffee,ffbf3c6,t1_feex1h4,1579762540.0,Ok so what you’re saying is the chemex probably isn’t the problem either way. I think I’ll just stick with that for now.
Coffee,ffbf08t,t1_feefu6y,1579762437.0,I’m trying that this week! I like that it’s also organic and cheaper than the usual beans I get.
Coffee,ffbezhl,t1_fefaoru,1579762413.0,I actually have Cafe Domingo right now. It’s pretty good!
Coffee,ffbeybc,t1_fedymvl,1579762375.0,"Sorry, I thought it may shed some light on something I was doing wrong potentially.

I found some beans near me from Guatemala, but the descriptions all call out fruity and acidic flavors specifically. I guess the roaster makes the difference, rather than just the bean origin."
Coffee,ffbeuxt,t1_fef08x1,1579762264.0,How do you make it? I’m going to try a bag! Found out it’s at all the stores near me!
Coffee,ffbetqj,t1_feea4rf,1579762226.0,"I just realized all the stores near me carry Counter Culture 46, at a really good price $12! The beans are organic too, that’s a plus. I’m picking up a bag tomorrow! Thanks for the suggestion. 

How do you make your coffee?"
castiron,ff2g7dq,t1_fezpcj3,1579504773.0,Thank you for the tips! Tomorrow morning I’ll try this.
RunningWithDogs,ff1qmiq,t1_fezo6on,1579484020.0,Nope. Chihuahua mix and Labrador retriever. Why are you so interested in that?
castiron,fezhc2f,t1_fezduxj,1579457360.0,"I use it about once a day, but might skip a day or two, which is why I bring to smoking point, but not sure if it’s necessary. But as long as it’s not harmful I’ll keep it up. 

Thank you!!"
castiron,fezcmmn,t1_fez8k6d,1579455977.0,"I just use a soft unsoaped brush to get rid of bits and hot water after every cook. Then dry immediately and heat to evap remaining water, and then spread thin layer of olive oil and bring to smoking point then let cool. 

Is that right?

Thank you, I’ll keep cooking and hoping it helps."
RunningWithDogs,feyxuik,t1_fey8ok7,1579451774.0,You guys are talking about the trail runner one right?
RunningWithDogs,feysfaj,t1_feylx1q,1579450039.0,"They were good dogs, but the breed of human was definitely jackass. He also had his daughter in tow, and he set a pretty lame example."
RunningWithDogs,feysafd,t1_fexumxn,1579449987.0,A spare slip lead sounds like a great idea. Thank you!
RunningWithDogs,fex3y4k,t1_fex3oyx,1579423904.0,Thank you! I’ll check that out.
puppy101,fep94f5,t3_eq1ut9,1579314909.0,That is the worst dog ever. Give him to me immediately. =)
dogs,fep8yh5,t1_feoobtz,1579314802.0,"Pretty sure he means for a service dog. I mean I don't let my dog do it, service dog or not, but it's not a peeve. It's probably a peeve to see a service dog do that, as it's a signal that the dog just isn't cut out for the job."
dogs,fep8v8j,t1_feov2c0,1579314744.0,"Doesn't matter that it's a teenage labrador or not, it's just pulling like that, which isn't a service dog behavior. Yes, i've had a teenage labrador, I was flown like a kite all the time, but I didn't pretend he could've been a service dog."
puppy101,fehc8kb,t3_ep4i3f,1579113578.0,"We visited our breeder and met up with my pup’s brother there too. They saw their mom and dad, plus some half siblings. They mostly acted like stranger dogs and not something like long lost kids. I’m sure they recognized each other, but it wasn’t fanatical like how your pup reacts when you come home after taking the trash out for a minute. 

It’s not bad. Nor is it especially good."
AskReddit,fehbmmz,t3_eoyn3a,1579113219.0,Back scratches from someone with just the perfect nails. I can’t believe this isn’t the top one.
Coffee,feeq87u,t1_feehaxb,1579038908.0,"oh really!? Ok so all my friends love the fruity notes, which is why they kept pushing the chemex on me. So a french press or v60 would be better?"
dogs,fdo7rz8,t1_fdn7kjp,1578600372.0,"Thanks. I’ve only seen them there the one time. I don’t think I’d be able to talk to the owner about it, he seemed determined that his dog is friendly. I think his dog is probably friendly, but needs to work on learning cues. 

My pup is learning ways to communicate she’s uncomfortable, and my biggest worry is when she tries everything but realizes nothing works short of fighting back. I always want to step in before that so she knows it’s not all on her. 

The good thing is she’s on the larger side and strong, so she doesn’t get trampled as easily as a smaller dog would. I could see a yorkie just getting decimated right away by purely the first impact. 

On the flip side I feel for the guy. My dog is sometimes overly rough with dogs she knows who are extremely energetic. Weirdly she’ll try to calm them down by pinning, specifically doodles. The energy just irks her for some reason. We always quickly call her off or I’m there to pull her off. With one of her pup friends, we usually let it ride out and she doesn’t escalate and let’s up when the pinned dog stops going nuts. Not sure if that’s a good thing? The dog isn’t scared or anything. Just sooooo excited to see her and wiggling like crazy. So maybe that’s what he thinks, but his pup isn’t under control and does it to stranger dogs."
reactivedogs,fdhzo1u,t3_elhdai,1578433094.0,"Our vet prescribed it (fluoxetine, genetic) for our 6 month puppy. Since then she’s become so much more manageable and is learning fast. Not sure if it’s due to the fluoxetine, but things are progressing so well I’m not going to risk taking her off of it just yet. 

All pups are different. Best to work with a vet and behaviorist to figure out what’s going to work, or even better to work with a veterinary behaviorist."
funny,fc6du5v,t1_fc63udr,1577478226.0,This is incredible. The dogs just make this 100x better to watch.
