todayilearned,fczkjgx,t3_ejhvub,1578103240.0,"Oh so now you’re talking about the ‘Trail of Tears’ when 1,000-5,000+ native Americans died thanks to Democrats. That wasn’t genocide. The intent was to relocate not to annihilate. Most relocated on their own to Oklahoma and others decided to stay and assimilate. The last group didn’t want to do either. They were forced to move to Oklahoma as per the agreement. It sucked for them but also for the settlers who were repeatedly attacked by hostile Indians."
todayilearned,fcycb1h,t1_fcy8yec,1578077943.0,"I know exactly what I’m talking about and know the difference between Noam Chomsky anti-American revisionist history and what actually happened. If anyone is wondering why it seems that charges of  ‘patriarchy’ and ‘white supremacy’ as is anti-America, anti-capitalism, pro-Marxist, pro-Socialism, ‘everyone is a victim and white man bad’  is all the rage they don’t have to look any further than the 1960’s radicals who’s goal is not progress but to destroy the only truly free country and land of opportunity -
The United States - and replace it with the typical repressive, totalitarian socialist Marxist police state where the thugs and criminals become the rulers and everyone else become the slaves. History keeps repeating itself because the basic premise of socialism is wrong. It is unnatural and unethical."
todayilearned,fcy13z7,t1_fcxymne,1578073274.0,"That didn’t happen. Millions of Native Americans were not killed by genocide. That is fake history. 90% of Native Americans died due to old world diseases originating from Africa that arrived with early explorers and traders - not settlers or colonists. The diseases were transmitted inadvertently not intentionally. 
They did not steal any land. The land was obtained in various contracts and treaties. Rogue Indian tribes frequently broke these treaties and would raid, kill and pillage settlers and colonists kidnapping the women and children they didn’t kill. Most Indians quickly fully integrated with the settlers and colonists and intermarried and became Westernized."
