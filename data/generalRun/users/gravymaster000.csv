Indiemakeupandmore,ff57wtq,t1_feyiqaq,1579582846.0,I’m interested in buying Moon Milk and Mama. I’ll send you a message!
Horses,fenhm46,t1_fenhjoj,1579284868.0,It is!!! Wow what a small world!
curlyhair,fe3w5zd,t1_fe1dfdx,1578853429.0,Yes of course!
muacirclejerk,fe3w4g2,t1_fe2a04a,1578853417.0,Srs yes!! It’s so great for ramen and pad thai. Any Asian food really. Highly recommend if you’re looking for low carb noodle options! It’s definitely different than wheat but it hits the spot.
curlyhair,fe08efo,t1_fe08bdw,1578805866.0,Messaging you directly! It’s Helm salon but I’ll send you my hair stylists profile.
muacirclejerk,fdzw550,t1_fdzvlxw,1578797228.0,"/srs it’s a jerk. I’m doing a low carb diet right now so these are actually plant based and 97% water, but I made a huge pot of ramen in my instapot so these noodles went with broth, chicken, an egg, and a bunch of vegetables."
curlyhair,fdzroqx,t1_fdzquom,1578794217.0,Thank you!!
curlyhair,fdzr77n,t3_engzgl,1578793922.0,"Routine: co-wash with Luvmilk conditioner (I love this conditioner so much and you can choose from multiple scents). Scrub with scalp scrubber and fingers for about 3 minutes while conditioner is in my hair (this is the only way I can co-wash without getting build up). Squish to condish then add leave in (I use toadstool from etsy), devacurl wave maker, and about a palm full of gel (using briogeo and I love it). I do all of this with my head upside down using the bowl method. Use microfiber to get excess water out then plop with microfiber towel for 5 minutes. From there I either air dry or diffuse. Once in a while I do a protein mask (Manuka honey and yogurt from Shea moisture). I also do a deep conditioning mask if my hair really needs it. Working with my texture has been a wild ride. You can see my progress in post history. Thanks to everyone in the community! I learned so much from all of you."
