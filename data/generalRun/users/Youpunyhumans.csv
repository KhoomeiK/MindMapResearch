Get a parasaur as a first tame. Easy and quick to tame, its decently quick and can carry a decent amount too. Its not the best for damage, but can defend itself from smaller predators with some levels in it. Also good for early berry gatherer and can detect predators nearby so you can attempt to avoid them.

Once you can get raptor saddles, get 3 of them for the pack boost,  and try to find opposite genders for at least one of them so you get the mate boost too, and have them follow you on the parasaur. Can save you from most dangers. Raptors are one the easier tames and are very versatile.

Bolas are your friend. Carry at least 5 on you while exploring incase you run into a raptor. They can save you in a pinch, just hit them in the legs and you have 30 seconds to escape. Be careful though, they usually come in packs and will follow you off cliffs.
