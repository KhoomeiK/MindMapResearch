Antipsychiatry,ffg9bco,t1_fffp7iv,1579901244.0,"Beautifully put — you verbalized a lot of what bothered me about the video but I hadn't quite put my finger on. There is a sense that ""the diagnosis"" has a life of its own and is pulling her even further in that direction instead of helping her overcome some of it. 

The tone of celebrating and accepting the diagnosis — which obviously comes from a place of love — is also problematic. There seems to be a fine line between accepting/celebrating it and deciding nothing needs to be improved. If she is so perfect the way she is, why try to get out more and overcome any social awkwardness? Why not stay in her room watching the anime for hours while her friends learn to drive and get careers?"
