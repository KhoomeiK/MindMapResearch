PickAnAndroidForMe,ffppys6,t1_ffntxsr,1580101671.0,"I dorked around on Amazon and found one. Its going to take like 2 weeks to get to me. I'm going to borrow a friends old phone so i have a phone of some kind in mean time.. 

i've never heard of a cell chipped tablet making calls. That is galaxy note territory. ""Phablets"" if that is still a buzz word. 
But You might be able to make calls from your tablet if you can get the thing to deploy the phone app. This might be APK Side loadable, or it might ship installed. No idea. 


My opinion on your 1a question  is that its a choice between ""More hassle"" vs. higher up front cost. 

Having two devices is a pain already. The choice seems to be having two discreet devices. You just pop one or the other out as needed. VS. having 2 devices that need each other linked, burning battery to maintain a tether, when a flip/feat. phone is simply not designed to kick all that juice out all the time. I'm assuming tablets with the Chips for cell access cost more still. So is that added cost a big proiblem? I'm thinking it probably isn't a big enough price diff. I'd recommend getting a samsung or apple tablet with the cell chip. But that's me. Do the price shopping and make your decision. 


2a/b - I do the bad thing and i DONT update my phones. I don't like Android 10. If you want the latest android then you probably need a newer phone. If that is the case, and you're not hung up on connection jacks and no-notching it, i otherwise liked the Razer and ROG phones. They aren't THAT stupid expensive for what they are, have great, GREAT screens, and good battery life. I skipped them because i didn't like Razer's port options and i didn't love the curved screen edgest on the ROG. 

2c - You may want to look at a phone with a SD card slot. I considered buying an ROG phone. I didn't love the curved screen. Price isn't my problem. Lack of Aux, presence of notch and locking down of an OS or bloatifictation/non-stock OS are my big concerns. 

If the pixel 3a had been available with 128gb storage, i'd have bought one. If the pixel 4a has 128 gb, i'm probably buying one of those and i'll relegate the pixel as my backup."
PickAnAndroidForMe,ffmgjlv,t1_ffko25q,1580054328.0,"i found another brand new pixel 1 xl and bought that. 

If i'd have bought a tablet and feature phone it probably would have bee either a ipad mini or latest galaxy tab, and the flip phone would have been some random thing from either LG or Motorola.

Let it be. Its fine to let people hoard and people suppose a problem exits that doesn't. 

Want people to use those items? Then design the game to make them useful. Hurt people so they heal. Is the game otherwise fun? Great. Then its fine. 

If you really must make people use items because you're that neurotic, then hurt them so they need to, or go with a system like D&D.

Dungeons and Dragons deals with this pretty well. You have healing spells and hit die for rest healing, so the only way to heal is to do some thing proactive with really rare exceptions. So, when resting you roll your hit die to heal and then rest, and you only have so many hit die that slooooowly recover over a long time and oyu need to be economical in their use. So, limited but recurring. So those 4 potions you just got? you might pop one to supplement your resting.

In CoD you can just run in to a room and one-man a lot of shit. CS can go that way for exceptional players, but those people learn things like where crouching is going to put some ones head, down a known hallway. So they aim there. They have the cross hairs timing down.

news,fei6bs2,t1_feh2k25,1579131251.0,"i don't have an answer to that. I'm simply telling you how the contract is worded. There are provisions that protect against housing discrimination based on ""family status""  - Eg. Land lords can't discriminate if one of the tenants has a kid and think on refusing to rent. 

On the other hand, those laws are to protect people from land lords. I'm guessing there are permits or housing statuses designed to create special category of housing for either rent, which likely allow for things like retirement homes or for assisted living homes. 

This is an owned home situation and very ,VERY likely would fall out side the scope of landlord protection laws, or anti discrimination housing laws.
