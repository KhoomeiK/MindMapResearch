This doctor I personally know, who's a family friend for decades, her daily routine is seeing 80 to 120 patients a day. She only drinks water during lunchtime (one hour standard in China) and after work because she doesn't have time to use the restroom. She's not an outlier and it's only on a normal day. Patients don't need appointment to see doctors. It's more like DMV  you walk in take a number then wait for your turn, except doctors don't waste any time when they work. There's no family doctor or anything you are used to in America. It's only hospitals and everybody with anything wrong just go to hospitals. Check how many doctors China has per 100,000 people.

China_Flu,fffajh1,t3_etay4e,1579879693.0,"Highly doubt the authenticity of the video. Here's my two cents:

1. Crowded hospital is the norms. In China many people go to the best hospital to see the best doctor if they have lightest cold symptoms. And yes, you can just walk into a hospital with no appointment, take a number, pay expert price, and bang you see the best doctor. Even on a normal winter day you have crowded hospitals, especially the good hospitals in big cities, now when everybody is freaking out it only makes sense you see such chaos.

2. Three dead bodies laying there for over half a day is extremely unlikely if not impossible at all. It doesn't even happen in field hospitals during a major war, even less so during an outbreak. And if you've ever been to a hospital in China in winter you know how hot they turn the heaters on. I don't see how people can act normal if there are 3 dead bodies in such small and confined space for over half a day.

3. Nurses and doctors are in full hazmat suits right now in Wuhan, at least the ones dealing with fever. I don't know how a nurse in that situation is on cellphone videotaping without being interrupted by patients and their families.

There are other things don't add up but I'm gonna just skip them. Knowing China it's more than likely the person took the video didn't get whatever she wanted so she's throwing a fit. *So she made things up thinking it's her revenge.* There have been multiple cases of patients ripping off facemasks/hazmat suits from doctors/nurses then spit on them because patients' demands were not met.

You have to be close to the unluckiest person on the planet to be rightfully worried. You have to have someone from Wuhan AND have the virus on your flight, which is already a super small chance to begin with. Now if this theoretical person exists, he/she had to be infected 0-4 days before the flight or a healthy carrier, which cuts down the chance significantly. Now again, since it's been 10 days since the theoretical contact and you don't have fever, it again cuts down the odds. AND, since you didn't go to Wuhan the chance of you infecting another person (that's if you somehow were infected which is near impossible at this point) is even much lower. I'm too lazy to do the math but that's pretty close to having particles next to you form a smoking hot girl who has a huge crush on you chance."

Last this one was discovered on December 13, made public on December 31 (not late if you know what you are talking about), unlike SARS was hidden for months.

Not saying China's response is great because it's not even close, but to say it's worse than SARS is disingenuous.

**EDIT**: SARS didn't come out of nowhere. It took a long time to evolve/mutate before outbreak. The first known case was likely in November, 2002 in Foshan, Guangdong, while first outbreak was in January, 2003 in Guangzhou. This time the first known case was on December 13, 2019, now we have an outbreak, which is almost the same timeframe. The differences are significant however. First the virus is still likely mutating, meaning it's still on very early stage (we have more time to react). Second, the virus is not remotely as bad as SARS even compare them on early stages. Third, again, China's reaction wasn't anywhere near great but it's lightyears better than during SARS. And fourth, this time we have experience from SARS and MERS, both in terms of prevention and treatment. All in all, we are facing a much less severe disease with much better equipment while in much better position.

history,ff1trat,t3_eqyd6e,1579485994.0,"Late to the party. Only one answer remotely touched the core issue, the rest, especially top comments, are bad, wrong, and lazy even by high school standards. The question is huge, it's a question way out of my ability to condense the answer to one Reddit comment unless I make it unearthly long. I'll do my best to give some leads.

First of all, the name Cultural Revolution is confusing or even misleading. It's neither a cultural movement nor a revolution, but a (series of, depending on how you view it) political movement(s) which Mao started to re-establish his leadership, purge opposition within the Party, and a failed attempt to appoint his successor as well as persevere his political legacy. Other Party leaders were Mao's victims, co-conspirators, accessories, and victims, in most cases all of the above. The cultural impact of the movement was never the goal. For example the denouncement of Confucius was a tool to denounce Lin Biao and furthermore Zhou Enlai.

Second, the destruction of Chinese culture began long before Cultural Revolution. Taiping Rebellion was the first attempt in modern history, while the first systematic and methodical attempt was the May Fourth Movement (some scholars even called to abolish Chinese characters for example). The Communist Party began its experiment in the late 1920s. Even the KMT had its run of reforming the Chinese culture.

Third, following the previous point, the desire to change, reform, or even destroy the Chinese culture, for the most part, was to find a solution to China's weakening compared to outside threat. Many leaders and scholars believe the Chinese culture was the root cause.

Fourth, to directly answer the question,  you don't ""destroy"" the Chinese culture by starting revolutions/wars, killing scholars, or burning books, these things had happened numerous times in history on much larger scale, but the Chinese culture triumphed. The Chinese culture was destroyed because there was (is) no place/value for the traditional culture to exist. Now that's a rather complex topic which took the Party decades to accomplish. There's a reason why the first two law China had from 1949 to 1979 was the New Marriage Law (the Constitution was technically the second law passed in China but since it has no practical purposes and doesn't apply to any actual cases, it's very different from a law).

Anyway, as bad as the Cultural Revolution was, it doesn't deserve the blame for destroying the culture. Instead of the deciding event, it was rather the final note of a symphony (probably not really the final note but that's another topic). There definitely were other events caused more damage. The Chinese culture was already dead when Cultural Revolution began. The movement was more like burning of the dead body instead of the actual killing."

You need to understand, paraphrase George Patton, you don't win a war by dying for your country. By WWII the human race had long passed the time an army could win the war alone. Russia lost its food source (Ukraine), destroyed its own oil fields, had to relocate and rebuild its industries in the middle of nowhere after losing most of its industrial zones when it had no means to do either on its own. How could Russia beat Germany alone? By letting Germans shoot Gulag prisoners till they run out of ammunition?

Speaking of which, Russia hasn't been an effective fighting machine since the early 1800s.
