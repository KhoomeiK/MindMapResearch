bipolar,ff76tb5,t1_ff75xow,1579642258.0,"I sleep a LOT and take tons of naps, about 6-10 hours most days. It's not that I see it in my food, it's that I'm absolutely 100% positive it is there. I cant eat bananas or yogurt anymore recently because I can just sense the bugs crawling around. I had a stomach ache and could feel cockroaches squirming around in me. The blinds in my apartment looked like they were dripping for a couple seconds. 

So I don't think it's a psychotic state? I think I'm just paranoid, which typically I always am. That everyone close to me is secretly conniving against me."
bipolar,ff05iu2,t1_ff04sf3,1579465393.0,Your explanation was incredible! It really helped clear a lot of things up for me! It definitely is something I've been experiencing but just chalked it up to my Bipolar disorder.

bipolar,feywo7p,t1_feytorp,1579451465.0,"I mean the symptoms and definitions I've seen online make sense, it's just hard to fathom? Like the symptoms with the exception of delusions seem so generic and overall blanketing. It's hard to know if I've experienced it (which I'm pretty sure I have?), or not. Maybe I'm just overthinking it. But thank you!"

bipolar,fda39jg,t1_fd7p09r,1578241132.0,That was very well said! I've started to accept my boss and my coworkers knew what was going on way before I even had an inkling myself. I just never put 2 and 2 together and realized my mental health professionals worked like that too! Thank you!
bipolar,fda2kcj,t1_fd7b9pf,1578240953.0,"I've hit every single one of those symtoms, with the exception of things looking weird. I get really long dissociative episodes, that have lasted for up to three months. 

When I asked my first psychiatrist about why I was dianosed Bipolar when the woman doing my therapy intake expressed that was most definitely Borderline, she seemed a little upset with me (could be my brain making mistakes, but she most definitely was not gentle), and insisted I was Bipolar mixed as opposed to Borderline and wouldnt explain anymore.

I'm still very confused about both disorders, though I mainly feel like I'm not allowed to claim the diagnosis of Bipolar because it's not as extreme as it would be for others. 

I have a new psychiatrist though so I will definitely pick her brain a little bit! Thank you!"
bipolar,fda1ggu,t1_fd79gt6,1578240614.0,"I was very recently diagnosed and entered treatment for with Bipolar from my paychiatrist. My original psychiatrist diagnosed me as bipolar, my new one just continued treatment. I had a therapist diagnose me as Borderline, and when I told my first psychiatrist, she got a lil upset and told me, ""Well it's Bipolar mixed"" and then told me she couldnt diagnose me as borderline yet because she was getting bipolar off me (if that makes any sense). 

I'll have to check with my insurance about who else I can go to to get a second opinion! That was very helpful!"
BPD,fd71w3u,t3_ek6h8h,1578198421.0,"You only need 5 out of the 9 things to be diagnosed with BPD (as well as a proven pattern of behaviors). This disorder presents itself in many, many different ways."

BPD,f9lvmrq,t3_e5q9s6,1575433238.0,"You can! And it does :( I was very fortunate to have a boss and team that understands, even before I did. It's essential to have a job, but the atmosphere is almost especially important to us, I believe :/"
