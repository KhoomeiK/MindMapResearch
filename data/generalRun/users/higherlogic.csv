LifeProTips,fffrxwl,t3_etd9nu,1579890490.0,Also works for things like Grubhub. You get an email like “Still Hungry?” Or something to finish your order and they throw in free delivery. It doesn’t work all the time but occasionally it happens.

FoodPorn,ffdgt1k,t1_ffd0h7z,1579820555.0,"Yes, but finishing it at a low temp is what caused the bigger than usual ring. I hear you about the smoke alarm, I don’t think there’s a way around that unfortunately unless you can grill outside. You might want to look at a reverse sear then. Cook the steak at a low temperature in the oven and quickly sear it on the range. But that might bring too much smoke as well. Do you use oil, and if so what kind? Alton Brown’s method works really well for not having to deal with smoke. Heat a cast iron for maybe 30-60 minutes at 500 F and take it out, out on burner on high, cook maybe 2 minutes per side and then right in to the oven for 4-5 minutes per side. Rest for 5-10."
webdev,ffczs6y,t1_ffcdu5z,1579810612.0,"That sounds more like a Developer. You have no DBA experience anything else (CI/CD, setting up a bare metal server or working with AWS services, Bash scripting or basic DevOps and SysAdmin). It’s maybe, maybe half of the equation but missing most of the vital parts."
webdev,ffczihw,t3_esu1hp,1579810462.0,"It’s going to vary from person to person, but to me it’s someone who can do frontend work (HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Vue or React, Webpack); backend work (a framework like Symfony or Laravel, API integration, etc.); CLI to deal with DevOps or SysAdmin type work, Bash scripting, LAMP/LEMP; working with SQL, automation, CI/CD, Docker, AWS, etc. Basically someone who can cover all the bases, but not necessarily be a master of everything. It’s more of a position that you earn after working professionally for 10+ years, definitely not something you’d pick up in a year or two or even 5 years."
