I'm the oldest of six, and the oldest of like 18 cousins, and also the only one not in apartment life.  Many older relatives have given me their China, I have my parent's wedding China for instance, two sets from my grandparents, one plain white set I purchased myself, One Thanksgiving seemed set I received as a gift for putting on Thanksgiving for the family, And a whole bunch of other inherited Chinas. 

I really really love my grandparent's formal set, I think the set I bought myself was very practical, and other than that, I've just started getting rid of them. People living paycheck to paycheck in apartments just do not care about having a formal dining room.

No, Greek gods were not all powerful. They were never written to be omnipotent, omniscient, or otherwise. They were shown to be more powerful than mortals, but not all powerful. They intervened in human lives one, because that made great stories, and two, because they were curious, horny, and bored. Being powerful alone is not a motivation.

Greek culture and religious beliefs were intertwined, it was not a secular culture with an optional religion. That's why public rejection of the theology was not accepted in society.

That being said, Greek religion was seen as part of the culture and daily life. To the ancient Greeks, you could not lead a Greek life and not worship at least some of the Gods. It wasn't like our secular cultures today, where one society can have many religions coexisting, it mingled in many facets of society. When you chose to reject the gods, you chose to reject Greek life, which is why many prolific rational thinkers who rejected the gods in public were punished. 

I think you should try to redefine your thinking of human culture. We are not that far separated from the cultures of 2,000 years ago.
