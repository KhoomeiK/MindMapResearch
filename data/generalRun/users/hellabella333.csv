And it does leave a pervading sense of awe and wonder, but these entities or experiences are just a glimpse of what is beyond the veil, and they are very briefly materializing in this 3D form: humans may lie but they also forget and get back to baseline quickly. I'd look into an ouija board, summoning via western witchcraft, DMT, and transcendental meditation if you truly want to have your own experience."
