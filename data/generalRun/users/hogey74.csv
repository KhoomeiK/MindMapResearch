PoliticalDiscussion,ff2lh44,t3_er1d6e,1579511744.0,"This is the question.  Thanks for asking it.  My answer is a big picture one.  Thanks in advance if you read through.

I realized a strange thing a few years ago.  Many if not most of the laws enacted or desired by right wingers are essentially correct and most efficient, provided every person has agency, power and knows their worth.  When everyone knows their value and responsibilities, we need many fewer laws and government can get out of the way, right?  But among many of those political activists there is a perception of governance that is based on getting power, enacting the laws and waiting for everything to work out.  Yeah, nah.  Ironically, it's the opposite side, so to speak, who are most likely to get us closer to the world in which those laws will be obvious and uncontroversial.  This blew my mind.  And made me wonder how we can cut the crap and make it happen.  

This requires something much more important than a slew of laws designed to ""give people a hand up rather than a hand out.""  And it's like the challenge of our generation(s).  

We've proliferated massively and successfully to the point of having world-wide societies, mobile phones and jet skis.  We have done awesomely well.  But we are also in the middle of screwing this right up, like every previous ""civilization"".  Due to one of the best things about us, we make things easier and better for each generation, which them grows up taking more and more for granted.  Eventually, we will become unable to cope with even minor shocks.  Hullo, trigger warnings lol.  

In the end I believe the one solution is also (with plenty of variation) the only lasting solution.  We have to take stock as a group of who, what, where and when we are.  What we've achieved, what we've screwed up and what our possibilities are.  Then, we have to create a curriculum for life that every child goes through, much more than just schooling, so that we all go through a microcosm of human development.  I think of this a bit like a second stage of foetal development:  in the womb we develop from a few cells to a tadpole to an ape, undergoing a version of evolution, until out we come as a baby human.  If we're going to make it in the long run, we then need a version of that to continue into and through adulthood.  

The truth is that we're all very lucky. Very. We're here at a time when things are massively better than at any previous time.  But most of us are beset by minor crap because we don't have the real perspective on that.  Witness the silly polarisation and other nonsense that besets us.  And the suicide rate.  The outcome we need is for everyone to grow into their bodies knowing that they're lucky, that they have endless possibility to do awesome things with their time and that they matter, no matter how many other people there are.  The answer is to give every child a real, if rushed, experience of how we got here.  Education of course, but the full gamut.  Living in tribes.  Having to sleep outside.  Going without stuff.  Learning to make things.  Experiencing discrimination and it's answers.  Fighting some of the fights our ancestors did.  Inventing some of the same things they did.  Living a curated but challenging, confronting micro-version of human history. Surrounded by difference and challenge and excitement.  At home and then out in the world, seeing how everyone else is doing it.

No one has been where we are.  And as we get more crowded and easily overheated, we approach a crisis of being.  Despite our success.  Because of it.  Social safety nets etc are important but we need to make them redundant and I believe we have to start from first principles and all get some perspective, before instilling it in every child."

TwoXChromosomes,fedikb3,t1_fedgaya,1579012438.0,"Because pairing sexual attractiveness with other messages is known to modify the way those messages are received.  You are free to dress as you please in western cultures and i don't care either way. I can't help positively judging people who dress nicely, as do you i imagine,  but not those who dress revealing in work and academic environments.  Those are  places where sexual attractiveness is not an appropriate or advantageous element to promote.  We're in the middle of a positive transition away from male domination of many sectors but some  people will get it wrong as we work out new norms.  That is how we learn.
