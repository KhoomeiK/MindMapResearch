IdiotsInCars,fefklvw,t3_eoqv8k,1579058317.0,"When I was around 4 years old, we had a range rover (one of the old ones). If you've ever been in a range rover you'd know that things just sort of break. For example, on our car, only the driver's door handle worked and we needed the key to open the boot. Another one of the things that had broken was the handbrake. One time we were parked and mum forgot to leave the car in gear (but still put the handbrake on). After coming back from my swimming lesson we found that the car had rolled across the entire Tuggeranong pool carpark and had lined itself up almost perfectly with another spot.

If you gain a position in a runoff area, you have to give it back, and if you didn't gain a position the stewards will decide what to do, usually a 5 sec time penalty if they think you got an advantage.

PublicFreakout,fcue6t8,t1_fcuayk4,1577978848.0,"Scott Morrison is a cunt. He got elected due to the fact that the other major party had a terrible campaign and Rupert Murdoch and Clive Palmer put lots of effort (and money) into getting Labor to lost (*Not* to get the coalition elected, it was all attack ads). 

The current fires are the biggest Australia has ever had. Shortly before they started, the NSW Liberal government cut funding to the fire service, an already controversial move at the time.

When the fires started, instead of doing literally anything else, Scott Morrison fucked off to Hawaii for a holiday, then said he was ""touched"" by people wanting him back in Australia. he's recently gone into damage control mode, visiting burned out areas to try and get photos with the locals. Problem for him is that the locals are not fans after the whole fiasco, and things like this happen.

EDIT: more awful things:

His government has imposed severe water restriction to the Australian populace, but has recently granted unlimited water to the Adani coal mine (which is another huge issue) and Coca-Cola.

He's also passed tax cuts to the rich (and only the rich), a bill that allows the government to spy on encrypted communications, and has fucked up the economy by a) selling off public assets and b) cutting spending so that the government goes into ""surplus"", instead of pumping in money while the interest rates are low, even though relative to other first-world countries, Australia has tiny government debt and enormous private debt, due to the fact that houses cost $1m+ because the government keeps introducing legislation that increases the financial benefit of holding investment properties."
