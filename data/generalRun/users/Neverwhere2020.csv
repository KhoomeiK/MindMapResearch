cats,ffzoq81,t1_ff6rxou,1580388272.0,"My adopted cat came without history either as she had been abandoned, but the cat shelter weighed her and put her on two meals a day - 30mg of dry food in the morning, 1 pouch wet food in the evening (she is 3.5kg - the pet food manufacturers usually provide feeding guides per pet weight).  When I took her home  the shelter advised me to stick to the same routine.  She would eat her food very quickly at first, but after a few weeks she became more settled and now eats more carefully.  

The dry food is good for their digestion and teeth/gums, but I think most cats prefer the wet food and will turn their nose up at the dry food if they are not hungry, often while crying for more wet food , so that's a good indicator if you are overfeeding. Good luck!"
cats,ffznl4c,t3_evzmru,1580387141.0,Scented candles are not good for kitty's sensitive little noses - possibly why yours is being fussy. That or they is just messin' with ya.
cats,femh5hb,t3_epi5jh,1579255280.0,What a sweetie.  Isn't it quite unusual to see a cat with a pink nose and black paw pads?
