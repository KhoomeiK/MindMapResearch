In fact at 5'2 you become obese at 160lbs!"

 Chances are you put too much stress on your body and the cortisol made you retain fluid (this is why many people will tell you to take breaks every now and then) so when you started eating more (but still less than your TDEE) you body wasn't as stressed  , lost any retained fluids and kept losing fat."
progresspics,fdwonkf,t1_fdw6g8j,1578760904.0,">  If your body thinks you’re starving it’s gonna hold on to any extra weight it can.

that actually doesn't happen, if you eat less calories your body has no other choice than to use fat reserves (since that's what they are for, fat is THE way for bodies to store energy), if it's not using fat then its getting energy from somewhere else."

its not because of our organs which, unless pregnant or ill with something like cysts, are pretty small but because of estrogen that we tend to get more fat in that area as well as in the butt+thighs. If you go down to something like 18% of body fat, which is still healthy though pretty hard, you can get a flat stomach"
