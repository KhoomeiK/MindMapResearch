SkincareAddiction,fgoxiie,t1_fgok4ps,1580990855.0,"It's not universally bad. I have super oily skin and live in a humid climate, so silicones in my primers and foundations make my makeup melt off. They are also kind of occlusive on my skin, which can cause breakouts."
drugstoreMUA,fgov7rf,t1_fgnubn2,1580988135.0,"My skin is super oily, and I highly recommend Catrice HD Liquid Coverage Foundation. It's matte and won't budge!"
aww,fgmit50,t1_fgka8b4,1580925428.0,"They can be. Many zoos take in neglected animals, and their breeding programs keep some endangered species alive."
NotMyJob,fgmhr0k,t1_fglvf4a,1580924808.0,I thought it was flooded.
aww,fgi5c7n,t1_fgi1vho,1580806309.0,Ethically irresponsible and plain wrong unless it's in a zoo or rescue habit.
therewasanattempt,fga53pw,t1_fg876km,1580646917.0,It probably was until my aunt saw it and shared it in a serious manner.
therewasanattempt,fg6azd2,t1_fg5iyr5,1580562019.0,"I'm an unassuming 5'2"" Caucasian lady with a last name so Italian it's stupid. The name is long, difficult to pronounce, and intimidating. Match it with an ethnic-sounding first name, and I get the full-body scanner every time. My husband with the 2 syllable German surname? Never."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fft2c3z,t1_ffsz0kz,1580203299.0,"Seconding the SLS free *with* fluoride. SLS is also part of what burns your mouth. I use The Natural Dentist Peppermint Sage Toothpaste, and it doesn't burn my mouth off, and I love it."
CatsNamedToothless,ffq41fp,t1_ffq09kw,1580119267.0,"""Cat Dancer"" cat charm toy on Chewy for $3.50. It's the best cat toy I've ever purchased!"
aww,ffq3y3f,t1_ffpywt3,1580119121.0,"Tell a rescue what you're looking for. They always have adult cats that need homes, but since a lot of people want kittens, the adults can wait years for adoption. But with an adult cat, you can know their personality. There are tons of super cuddly, playful cats!"
Instagramreality,ffks7x6,t1_ffjucnx,1580027957.0,"Absolutely. It's why I tried it, initially. It's affordable, easy to find, and cruelty-free! My hair is just dyed black, but the Unwined HASK line is super gentle on it. Even their base lines like the coconut oil are great, though.

I wait until it's 50% off at Ulta to stock up."
Instagramreality,ffjua37,t1_ffizzur,1580007122.0,Seconding the HASK. It's way better quality than Biolage at a fraction of the price. My hair loves it.
