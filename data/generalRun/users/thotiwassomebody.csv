happy,fejkgif,t1_fejjyom,1579177892.0,I'd say this comment is more about that than anything
happy,fejj0mv,t1_fej40q7,1579176339.0,You lack the perspective of having a child with a heart defect. It's a wild rollercoaster of fear and elation.....Sharing helps so let's be better than this.
happy,feixwgr,t3_epaxd5,1579150272.0,Such a precious site. Sadly I lost my heart warrior when he was 2 months old.
diytubes,feiom6a,t3_epaw7p,1579143401.0,Funny you post this. I hooked up my scope to a freq generator I just got from an old ham . It has a 1mhz clock output on the back and this is the waveform I got and it perplexed me. Now I know what it is!
LivestreamFail,fedkmoi,t3_eofcik,1579013882.0,Who does she think she is?!
BetterEveryLoop,fe61b3e,t3_enwfry,1578879564.0,That was amazing to watch
amateurradio,fe03f3u,t1_fe01u4a,1578802088.0,It's called a jst connector and they come in many flavors but at least you know what to search for now...
freebsd,fdmxheo,t1_fdmutid,1578570212.0,Whatever let's you sleep at night.....
freebsd,fdma2y4,t1_fdkn4cj,1578543610.0,Looking through your post history is just sad. It plays out just like this over and over again. You making condescending remarks or talking about how awesome you are while offering nothing to the conversation.
freebsd,fdknc20,t1_fdkn4cj,1578507146.0,"Please, share your experience. I'm not saying its not possible. Just that it's never fully worked out for me."
freebsd,fdkma9f,t3_elw5pb,1578506496.0,"Yeah, FreeBSD on a laptop has never gone well for me. Unless you want to do a lot of reading/compiling/crying it's best to use it on older better supported hardware and definitely not a laptop...."
amateurradio,fdkk42w,t1_fdk1sod,1578505297.0,I started with a baofeng 2 years ago. It only makes sense to start with something at this price point. I now have two yaesu radios because I was able to get into the hobby so cheaply at the begining and see that it was something I wanted to invest in. I have the 771 antenna and can hit the local repeater from my living room with it which is cool.
amateurradio,fdkj8h1,t1_fdkhv6d,1578504869.0,"Thank you for this lol, absolutely love the u/ btw"
amateurradio,fdk3via,t1_fdk1nuz,1578495419.0,Really added a lot to the conversation with this comment...... But hey at least we know how you feel.....
