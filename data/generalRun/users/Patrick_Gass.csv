If something else is physically active and more enjoyable and means you're consistent, more power to you.

It sounds like you haven't found something you really enjoy, doesn't mean there isn't something different you could be doing. I, for instance, could never work out on my own because I find it so demotivating but put me in a class setting with other people and I'm completely motivated."

Well, by that same logic again, the Great Lakes are bigger/wider than the Irish sea. We have a bigger expanse between the population centre of Canada from the United States than the Irish do from England.

>Not really, since most of the constituents of these countries do not live so close to one another.

The distance from Paris to Berlin (the two biggest cities in their respective countries) is \~1100km. The distance from Toronto to New York (again, major population centres) is \~800km.

My point though is that geographical distance matters less than political and social history, and cultural roots.

&#x200B;

Here are a few examples I would like to highlight:

a) Canada has spent 400 years entwined in a political union of two major language groups, French and English, and have made relatively greater attempts at giving political weight to our indigenous populations (see: [Nunavut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut)).

America's second primary language is Spanish. Languages are a big part of cultural roots, so there would be differences of course. Also, the country as a whole has had, I would argue, a more contentious relationship with their own indigenous populations (please forgive me these gross oversimplications).

b) America was much more deeply entrenched in the slave trade than Canada. Slavery in the areas we know as Canada came to an end roughly 1834 (when it was abolished in British Parliament). Note that Canada didn't officially become a nation until 1867. Our political institutions were not built up around the idea of inherent racial inequalities.

America came into being in 1776 and did not abolish slavery until 1863, after the civil war. America's government grew and developed in an environment where slavery was still prominent, and I would argue that has had a significant impact on American political history (see: [Jim Crow laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws))

c) Americans fought a war of independence against British rule, whereas Canada seceded through an act of Parliament in 1867. In fact, many British loyalists came to Canada from the United States.

&#x200B;

There are many more examples but hopefully you get a sense to what I'm referring.

Geography certainly plays a part, don't get me wrong. I would say most people in northern American states have more in common with Canadians than they would with Americans from southern states, and presumably climate plays a subtle and pervasive part in all of that. One could easily imagine rewritting the Canadian border a little further south while still maintaining roughly the same political demographics.

Interesting tidbit, most if not all(?) states that have abolished the death penalty, either border Canada or are a state that borders a state that borders Canada.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I imagine I'll continue to get downvoted for what I've been saying but I honestly believe and will continue to argue there are essential differences in political outlook and cultural output between most Americans and most Canadians.

&#x200B;

EDIT: A passing thought, a lot of trouble in discussing the issue comes in no small part to how big these two countries are... Nova Scotians have a great deal in common with New Englanders, the Acadians have a lot in common in with the Cajuns (given their shared history), and so forth, but what does it mean to compare ""America"" with ""Canada"" when there are vast internal divides within both countries?

If we're not going to address things region by region, then, if we're looking at the whole picture we should concentrate on shared institutions and that's where I see the most marked difference between Americans and Canadians. Canada is not a two party system, Canada has universal healthcare coverage, Canada pursues a more diplomatic and consensus based approach to international politics rather than leveraging their military, etc."

They are not, strictly speaking, measures of people’s strategic thinking or their overall abilities.

Some people play to try to execute builds to perfection, it’s true. Like golf, these players are mainly playing against themselves. In this sense I imagine that early cheese is a lot like  having a slice in your drive... no matter how much fun it might be to practice chipping out of a bunker, or to focus on your short game, you’re forced to keep hitting balls over and over and over at the driving range.

Even restricting ourselves to the logic in this caption, are there no fuck girls? Wouldn’t it stand to reason that women are capable of having the same personality traits as men? and you’re expecting one kind of behaviour from them instead of another.

Christmas would be *way* down on that list.

We do hate it, though, as we hate all days. We’re mostly just filled with indiscriminate rage.

P.S. I’m sorry I flew off the handle like that."
