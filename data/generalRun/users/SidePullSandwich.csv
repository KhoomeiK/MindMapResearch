vfx,fep4x4i,t1_fep2wqb,1579312208.0,That’s why I said the good ones move into senior positions and the rest are stuck in dead end jobs.
editors,fenewl6,t3_eq0nox,1579283209.0,I’m guessing abstract thought has never been an issue for you.
bouldering,fels5mw,t1_fekpdt1,1579229600.0,I’m going to second that. Touchstone gyms represent!
vfx,felqnpp,t3_eps04p,1579228581.0,"I’ll add too that in general, production is a dead end job. It doesn’t pay well, so the ones that are good either move into senior management if a limited spot opens or leave the industry all together. What you are left with is a bunch of fanboys that want to be associated with the entertainment industry, but have no real skill sets.

I don’t have experience with MPC specifically but this is the pattern for everywhere I’ve worked."

SandersForPresident,fe6fzso,t3_envt4l,1578889754.0,"This is a very disingenuous post and does nothing for ""the cause."" Reading through the comments, you were denied a cast because they were waiting a few days for the swelling to go down. I broke my left ankle about a year ago too and it was the same process. Not being able to get a follow up to due cost is a travesty in it's own right, but framing it in this manner will only give more fodder to those who shuck off universal healthcare as a libtard fantasy."
editors,fe6dzrq,t1_fe62eqe,1578888116.0,"Good to keep that in mind. I probably don't have the same experience you do, but I see this conversation coming up in my near future."
editors,fe6d4s8,t1_fe0ttx4,1578887431.0,"I'm with you on the implosion fears. AppleTV+, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, HBOMax, Disney+, Quibi, and everything else out there won't all last. There will be a massive consolidation at some point. For the time being though, make hay while the sun shines and leave the garbage heap that is Los Angeles when it all dries up."
aww,fdtq6an,t3_emp40w,1578720488.0,Zermatt is a magical fairytale land and everyone should go.
aww,fdowlwv,t1_fdotsh6,1578614540.0,It’s in r/turtle. The mods in this group have no sense of humor.
editors,fddxnnf,t1_fddsjdh,1578326477.0,"There's a lot of conversational tips that you can pick up, such as mirroring, from any cursory google search, but one key detail I feel is almost always left out is to remember that the VP or whoever else you are dealing with typically does not have the sole power to give you whatever raise you are seeking. He or she will have to go to his or her superior and make the case. So, you better give that person some good points to work with in that presentation. That usually means the clear leverage you have, like another job offer, but can also be metrics on your productivity, experience, etc. Bottom line, don't just throw the numbers around. Present a reason why the current number is not acceptable."
aww,fdclflg,t1_fdcl8nl,1578277823.0,"Thanks. Check this back in about 20 minutes, as the mods will certainly erase me mentioning them here and my previous comment."
aww,fdcl4ix,t1_fctqn8s,1578277605.0,"I appreciated the gold. Do know it is at r/turtle, as the mods in this group won't let me post it and keep editing me mentioning that out of my comments."

personalfinance,fd7rq21,t3_ek9a3d,1578209058.0,"There’s a lot of relevant talk about the IRS in this thread, but be sure to check with your state as well when making your decision. For example, in California, every business owes a minimum of $800 regardless of revenue or activity. That alone would make it not worth it to formally create a business around your level of expenses."
aww,fd2vxim,t1_fd1xgc0,1578152168.0,Need until Sunday. Turns outs my actual job required attention.
editors,fcyhx5e,t1_fcy0ik9,1578080468.0,I have an embiggened eye for this based on my work experience.
editors,fcv6ujc,t1_fcuo4n1,1577995860.0,The dude works at an agency. He knows this already.
aww,fctguwo,t1_fctg158,1577942848.0,"I need a day or two, but it will be posted."
aww,fctfnz0,t1_fctbhv6,1577941755.0,I was actually able to download the source file from imgur. I guess I've found a project file myself.
editors,fctfgg0,t1_fct6y87,1577941566.0,Thank you!!! It makes sense that it would be a restoration company. I'm sure they just had a bevy of online editors cropping the shit out of the episodes.
editors,fctf8ho,t1_fct9eu9,1577941362.0,Props to everyone that got more residuals due to this error.
editors,fctf7gl,t1_fct5wa5,1577941336.0,"If you watch it with the right mindset, you can see there was more thought put into it than just blowing it up. I think some jokes were lost because they just couldn't make it on screen, but someone had to go through shot by shot to choose new framing.

There's a few examples I could give, but the most salient one I noticed was that whenever there's a shot of a television full screen, it is pillar boxed in 4:3, as you would completely miss the TV mask if it was blown up. Another thing that keeps bumping my eye is the shakiness of some of the camera moves. It's because they are using the existing camera moves as opportunities to adjust the framing. But the original camera work in the earlier episodes was done manually with optical cameras, so it doesn't have the perfect interpolation of digital keyframes. I've worked in animation post production for quite some time now, so all these little things annoy me. Overall though, still great to have The Simpsons on demand."
aww,fct55g7,t3_eirarc,1577933139.0,Do you have the source file for this? It would be great to color correct it and crop to a cinema aspect ratio.
Conservative,fc09pvj,t3_efg8ty,1577284209.0,"This is actually a really good idea and I don’t understand why more conservatives don’t support this. Free markets should determine what housing goes where, not regulations."
