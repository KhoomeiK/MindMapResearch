I follow loads of design blogs and websites and see hundreds of examples of stuff that is better than the vast majority of posts on this subreddit. Sadly they wouldn't get anywhere because this sub classifies design porn as ""thing that looks like another thing.""

Obviously you need to be slow and careful with your tools but the actual shaping part is easy with the right butthole! Once you get it close, dry it with a little baking torch and use a blade to smooth and finish everything up to be perfectly round."

sydney,ffdmn3d,t1_ffdj7hp,1579824121.0,"No, I just don't think you should be surprised if other people do. If you do a private thing in a public place, that's weird and you shouldn't expect privacy. You want privacy? Do a private thing in a private place. Not a hard concept."
Wellthatsucks,ffdm61e,t1_ffdktf4,1579823828.0,"There's a lot of hypotheticals in your explanation — who says they can't breathe easily? Who said they were stuck like that for a while? Who says they care about being on the internet? Who says the phone was damaged?

And lastly, as somebody who has had tape on his hair before, this is the absolutely best way it could be applied — flat, straight on, on the outermost surface of hair. The tape's glue isn't on one uniform surface, it is acting upon millions of tiny surfaces. This means that it's incredibly easy and painless to pull off.

I dunno, maybe I find it hard to relate since, if this happened to me, I really wouldn't give a shit. I'd be laughing as hard as the girl. Life's too short to get hung up on harmless things like this."

Wellthatsucks,ffdglhe,t1_ffdgi0s,1579820431.0,I was so happy that person commented that because I just knew I had the perfect Facebook profile pic waiting in the sidelines.
Wellthatsucks,ffdgen1,t1_ffdfyr3,1579820322.0,"Yup, as long as the tape is applied straight on, flat, on the outermost layer of hair (i.e not twisting at turning underneath the layers (and in the video, it looks like this is the case)), this is as easy to remove as tape from a piece of paper.

In fact, it's even easier than that because the tape is attached to millions of small surfaces and not one continuous surface. Meaning its tack on every individual hair is absolutely minimal."

Wellthatsucks,ffdfk61,t3_eswvxj,1579819824.0,"I am honestly amazed at how many people are treating this like it's a war crime.

It's packaging tape. Have you people ever used packaging tape? It loses its tack the moment it comes into contact with anything other than cardboard. I know this for a fact because I have had packaging tape on my hair before, and not only was it incredibly easy to get off, the level of pain was equivalent to having a few hairs plucked.

Not only that, the girl is in fits of laughter. People calling the woman an asshole when all three people in the video are laughing their heads off? What's your logic here?

It's clear that they know each other, know their senses of humour, know how they react to different situations. Obviously if the teacher knew you psychopaths, she'd know better than to go anywhere near you without permission first. 

The amount of people here saying that they would punch the taper, holy fuck. That's not how normal people react."
Wellthatsucks,ffdetyu,t1_ffd4spn,1579819384.0,"No, because in real life people are generally a lot more forgiving than the legions of angrybois on reddit who can't take a joke."
Wellthatsucks,ffdeq41,t1_ffdb3le,1579819319.0,"Well good thing this person didn't do it to you then. I imagine your friends know this and wouldn't do this to you. Thankfully this girl seems fine with it. Seems a stretch to call a person 'awful' because she didn't do something bad to you.

Edit: can somebody explain these downvotes to me? I'm having trouble understanding why a person is awful for understanding context and the people she's around so she can pull off a harmless prank"
Wellthatsucks,ffdemgh,t1_ffd6nmr,1579819258.0,Definitely an over-reaction.
