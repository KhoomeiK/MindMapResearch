An ex of mine has a pretty specific type. We split amicably and weren't together real long. I think we both knew there just wasn't a spark there. 

Anyhow, we dated in high school. The next girl he dated we both went to college with. She & I actually had the same major so we had classes together. Like me, she was short, slightly heavyset, dark brown, long & curly hair. They got married & had a little girl. 

She cheated, they divorced & moved on several years ago. The next girl he started dating he and I went to high school with. 
She is a few inches taller than me and his ex-wife. All of the other comparison points are still the same. Heavy set, brown curly hair she keeps an inch or so shorter than mine. I forget now exactly what age & group she specifically works with, but I know she's teaching. They eventually married. 

Really the two of them are so very good for each other. They both came in with a kid that the other 100% loves and cares about. 
They're both really good people who went through some rough things before they ever started seeing each other. They are two of the most genuinely kind people I know.

The dog I grew up with, I had this game I'd play with him. We'd wrestle around some and while we played, I'd get him going with ""You get em, boy. GO GET EM! Do you hear that? GERR GET EM."" He would just growl and bark all fierce. Then I'd flip to coddling. ""Awww who's a brave boy? You're such a brave boy. You're a tough doggie, aren't ya"" 

That adorable, wonderful, amazing goober would immediately be whole butt wagging (because it was never just his tail), and he'd flop down on his back for belly rubs. While I leaned over him scratching his belly, he'd turn his head to whichever side I was on & whine really loud until I was using one hand to pet his head and the other for the belly. 

He was an amazing dog. When he passed I never thought I could ever love another dog so much. Well, the pup we got after he passed we just lost to cancer last October. She was the absolute best girl I could have ever asked for. 

I miss them both so much & I'm still reeling over her. One thing that is helping though is knowing that neither of them were ever without food, water, warmth, safety, a happy home & so much love. Animals are just the best

If one wanted to turn it around to say that Fox manipulates viewers in order to sway them to vote Republican but even then, that's not what I would call controversial. I mean, we knew that already.

My uncle lived in my Grandparents old place for a lot of years and had everything looking really amazing. Beautiful hardwood floors, oak cabinets and countertops. 

We had no idea until many years later when they put the house back up for sale & we decided to give it a look for old times sake that they had just completely dumped anything nice about the place. 

As if it wasn't bad enough that they covered the hardwood floors at all, it was made worse by the fact that they did it with shag carpeting. It was this really ugly sinus infection booger green. 

They had painted all of the oak cabinets purple. Yes, you read that correctly. 

They apparently decided they didn't like the island counter in the kitchen, which IIRC was also oak, so they had that beautiful counter ripped out. That now left a big gap in the middle of what had been hardwood floor in the kitchen. Their great idea for fixing it was to fill the space with tile floor, which of course still left gaps because those tiles weren't going to line up with the wood.  Then they BOUGHT A SMALL TABLE to put there instead (-think roundtop, single table that you might see at a cafe or bistro) it was used regularly for space while they made meals so they had room to cut veggies or whatever.  Let's go over that again; they had the Island removed, fucked up the beautiful kitchen floor with tile in the middle of the wood, put a small table over it that they used while making meals.

television,femafj8,t1_fem4nvw,1579245915.0,"First of all, the fact that there is even someone dense enough to believe in constantly debunked fake and false medical claims is a joke. I assume you've already ordered your scented ""vagina"" candle. Did she advise folks to put those into orifices before lighting them? I bet she did. 

Finally, since people like you that spread false information that could actually cause extreme health problems, have it your way. Hopefully this at least reminds the people with common sense that Paltrow is a wack job. 

1. Paltrow does not have any type of medical degree. She doesn't have any college degree for that matter. 

Paltrow studied anthropology for a very short time before she dropped out of college to pursue acting. 

Anthropology has nothing to do with health treatments or ailments. It doesn't have anything to do with rocks and eggs and special stones to shove up your cooter. 

That automatically makes her a phony. Her Gopp brand is entirely based on the idea that she has knowledge of healing ailments like an old shaman or something. She does not and THAT should be enough right there to keep any sane person away. You don't take treatments from non-medical professionals. That is just common sense. 

2. Don't put Jade eggs in your vagina. 
[Jade has no healing properties whatsoever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade?wprov=sfla1)

It is a stone. It comes in 2 varieties and you can read for yourself. One is made of nephrite, which is calcium & magnesium. The other is Jadeite, which is aluminum and 
Sodium. 

They are literally just colorful rocks that have been polished to look like eggs. 

Now, this is why they're dangerous to insert into your vagina: 

[A letter to Goop from Gynecologist, Dr. Jen Gunter](https://drjengunter.com/2017/01/17/dear-gwyneth-paltrow-im-a-gyn-and-your-vaginal-jade-eggs-are-a-bad-idea/)

A couple of key points from this letter: 

As for the recommendation that women sleep with a jade egg in their vaginas I would like to point out that jade is porous which could allow bacteria to get inside and so the egg could act like a [fomite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomite?wprov=sfla) . 
This is not good, in case you were wondering. It could be a risk factor for [bacterial vaginosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_vaginosis?wprov=sfla1) or even the potentially deadly [toxic shock syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_shock_syndrome?wprov=sfla1)

[A task force made up of prosecutors from 10 counties in California investigated Goop and found the company was misleading consumers by making statements not backed by scientific evidence.](https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/2018/9/6/17826924/goop-yoni-egg-gwyneth-paltrow-settlement)

[Doctor Jen Gunter also reviewed 161 Goop products & proved that at least 90% of the wellness products are absolutely pseudoscience](https://drjengunter.com/2018/10/13/i-reviewed-all-161-of-goops-wellness-products-for-pseudoscience-heres-what-i-found/)

Last point. Are you aware that despite her claim that several gynos recommend her products, it's actually only **one** woman who is a midwife, not a gyno?"
IAmA,fem6d3p,t1_fem64l5,1579241340.0,Exactly
IAmA,fem6c5o,t1_fekopuw,1579241313.0,"Well first, I think it's important to know that false rapes make up barely 2% on average or an absolute max of 8% of false reports. That's not in defense of people like that. That's a horrific thing to do to anyone and always needs to be responded to with jail time. 


It's awful that anyone could do something like that to another person and though it's no silver lining, knowing it happens so infrequently is both a good thing and a bad thing at the same time. 

You don't want to think about people being raped. It's obviously not something you wish on somebody so such a small percentage of people having that done to their life gives you a sort of glad feeling that there aren't more people ruining someone's life.

Then you get that lightbulb that reminds you that a small percentage of false reports means a huge percentage of legitimate rape cases. 

I understand what you're getting at as far as the Sherriff's comments but they still don't sit right with me. It really read that he was being dismissive because most victims as I talked about before, want nothing to do with having to talk about what they went through. 

On another note, it feels very unprofessional for him to have said, and I'm paraphrasing here, ""Well most other police departments don't even do their reports so at least we're filing ours,"" it was as if to say 'Yea we just write off a bunch or rape reports without looking at them but look what other police do! That has to count for something!'"

It's dangerous. It's stupid. There's a reason why during safe sex education, it is stressed that you not insert things into your body cavities that are not safety made sex toys. You can cause all sorts of problems. You can end up with infections."
IAmA,fekqn5i,t1_fek0lxv,1579205596.0,"Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong as I obviously don't know you. I'd like to hazard a guess that you've been very fortunate to have a life where you haven't ever experienced sexual assault, and that's great. 

The thing is, if you've not experienced such a traumatic violation of your own body or been the friend of someone that went through it, you cannot imagine the toll that it takes on a person. 

Tack on that when victims **do** come forward, particularly with female victims, they're put through such harsh questioning that includes a LOT of victim blaming. 

*Were you drunk?* 

*What were you wearing?*

*Were you out walking alone?*

*Are you SURE it was rape?* 

No victim of that crime should be treated like that and especially not from law enforcement officers who's literal job is to protect and serve. 

You can't force a victim to press charges when they know that even if it DID manage to go to trial, defense attorneys will put them through hell all over again. For some, it takes years of therapy to be able to cope with what they went through. 

It's not a matter of these victims not wanting to make sure it never happens to someone else. Of course no decent human wants that. But if you push a rape victim & try to force a decision on them by using that argument, you're essentially telling that victim that if the rapist that attacked them hurts someone else, it will be on the victim for not speaking up. 


You feel terrified, scared, guilty, self-loathing, 
ashamed & then to have the law victim-blame you. Plus, that doesn't even cover people who you know (co-workers, friends, family) if they were to find out. You will be anxious and scared about what they may have heard, whether they believe you, whether they think you're making it up. What if the rapist is someone all of your friends know? What if they think you just got drunk and regretted it in the morning? 

That is a LOT for one person to experience, let alone cope with physically, mentally and emotionally. 

Now, imagine having all of that already in your brain constantly but you're also famous, or the individual who raped you is. 
Now, all of your life gets dug into unless you're a minor or you've chosen to file with a lawyer with your name protected.  More than likely though, your name will be in every trashy magazine, all over social media pages. You may get harassed on your own social media accounts, bullies, name called. 

You wouldn't be completely alone. You would have people showering you with as much support and love as you could handle, but it would also feel like the entire world was against you. 

*THAT* is why so many victims don't come forward, but that doesn't mean we don't want to help."
IAmA,feki3my,t1_fejzs4a,1579200508.0,"Wow. I have no idea what to say to that.

[This](http://imgur.com/gallery/fQ9HKax) is resistbot

ResistBot is a program you use via text messages to keep up to date on the daily goings-on in our government. It lets you know about upcoming bills to be voted on, the newest bullshit from Trump & other issues that need attention & that we all should be frequently contacting our reps about. 

Not everyone is great at figuring out how to word messages in regards to these and ResistBot helps with that too. It will give you a premade email on the issue that you can send as is or add to it before sending. 

I've been using ResistBot since shortly before it came out which was pretty quickly after the 2016 elections IIRC

You don't have to download an app that is going to take space on your phone. You don't have to worry about getting bombarded with text messages from it either because it doesn't do that. It will being up prompts to ask if you want to contact your reps on whatever issue and if you don't reply, it won't message you again for response. 

You text 'resist' to 50409 and the chatbot will respond to get you started. 

I've found this so super helpful since most of us are on our phones fairly regularly. It makes for a quick notification to tell you when an issue will be voted on, etc. 

I highly recommend it for anyone that wants to be more involved but doesn't have the open time for canvassing or can't always get to protests. 

Holding every one of our representatives accountable to the majority of this country is a must. 5 minutes on our phone sending letters or calling reps is extremely important."
