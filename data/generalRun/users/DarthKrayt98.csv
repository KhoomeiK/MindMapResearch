You're right, the founding fathers weren't gods, but they *were* very intelligent and knew the cost of a sense of security: freedom. *You cannot trust the state*

And your last point is a straight lie. Cities like Chicago and Baltimore, with strong histories of gun murder, have some of the strictest gun laws. 

Let's put this whole thing into perspective. In 2018, according to the CDC, 39,773 people were killed by guns in the US. 21,159 of those are suicides; no gun law is going to stop that, and that leaves 18,614. In 2018, there were about 327.2 million people in the US, leaving your average chance of dying by gunshot wound at approximately .005688875305%, even including unintentional shootings. By comparison, about 40,000 people were killed in traffic in the US in 2018, so let's ban those cars, or at least the cellphones distracting them. An estimated 80,000 died due to alcohol-related causes, so let's ban that liquor you enjoy. About 300,000 died due to obesity-related complications, so no more McDonald's. An estimated 480,000 die from tobacco-related causes, some one whom are simply the victims of secondhand smoke, so let's ban all of that.

68,557 people died by drug overdose, so let's ban those drugs; oh, wait a minute...

The point here isn't that gun deaths don't matter, but you have ample historic evidence available to you about how regulation doesn't work as intended, and how heavy gun control is used by governments to disarm their citizens."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,ffrvjrm,t1_ffrsye1,1580166813.0,"I didn't say it was more or less likely. You're adding parts to the scenario that aren't there. 

The issue is that we've decided that, in most parts of the country, people aged 18-20 aren't real adults, and can't own a handgun, purchase tobacco, or drink alcohol. Many places like college campuses and schools don't allow guns unless you're a uniformed LEO. Where do these high-profile shootings occur? In gun-free zones; over 90% of them, in fact."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,ffq8cy6,t1_ffq3okz,1580125693.0,"How about a scenario for you? 

Let's take a young woman. She's 20, so has legally been an adult for two years; but like in many states, she can't own a handgun until she's 21, because fuck the age of adulthood, apparently. Or maybe she's on her college campus, which is a gun-free zone, because those darn criminals sure do follow those cool signs.

She's attacked by a large man who was not stopped by her little taser or maybe pepper spray and she's consequently raped. 

What do you say to that woman? That restricting her constitutional right was for the greater good? That she was safer without a gun? *That she doesn't have a real right to defend herself because people think guns are scary?*"

Even if I didn't believe that a bunch of civilians could effectively fight off their own government, that's still not enough to justify it. The simple fact that it's a constitutionally protected right for damn good reason is enough to resist any significant form of gun control.

Of course, you can't control everything that happens to you, so if an incident does occur, remove your car topper and anything on your person that you could remove. Don't mention to your insurance that you were on the clock when it happened. I've had guys beat the system that way.

If you abolish tipping, then companies like pizza chains will charge more for their food and for their delivery fee to offset their additional labor costs. No customer will save any money. Tipping provides an incentive for tipped employees to offer good service, and how quickly do you think that service will decline if tipping is abolished?

People clearly don't mind it now, because my store runs about 50% delivery and on any average day, over 90% of delivery customers leave at least some tip, and that's something you'll find across the country. If it really bothered people, industries like food delivery would be dying, but instead they're thriving under third parties in addition to classic food delivery, like pizza."

Third, that delivery driver is using their own vehicle and gas, accruing low-speed miles on their car. The tip is part of the money they make to repair their car and put gas in it. 

Finally, no one ""aspires"" to be a delivery driver. In many areas and under many employers, it's a great way to earn money, especially if you're looking for a second and/or part-time job.

Tipping is customary in the US. That's the way it is, at least for now, and if you receive good service from an employee that normally receives tips, and then don't tip that person, you're an asshole. It's that simple. You absolutely have a right to not tip, and maybe you're broke, but that *does* mean you shouldn't order in the first place. If you get poor service, don't tip; that's completely reasonable. 

Abolishing the tipping system will *not* save the average customer money. The additional labor cost to the company will be passed to the customer through the prices of the goods and/or services they offer. The only difference will be more money for the government as they take more of the driver's paycheck, as most don't claim all, or maybe any, of their cash tips, which will obviously result in less money for drivers. Eventually, no one will want to work as a delivery driver because it doesn't make them enough, and employers will be forced to pay them even more, passing on an even higher cost to their customers.

You don't really think about things, do you?

FreeSpeech,fdo22vd,t1_fdnzi5q,1578597470.0,That's exactly what you said. You want to censor all religious content so it can be forgotten. That's against free speech. What's hard to understand about this?
Anarcho_Capitalism,fdo1tod,t1_fdncgex,1578597334.0,"Most likely unskilled. Almost every business that employs unskilled workers in my area is desperate for staff, primarily fast food restaurants. Hell, even some skilled laborers like hair stylists and lifeguards (idk if they really count as 'skilled') are hard to find."

Plenty of fans like me will continue to enjoy the content they produce because Star Wars is Star Wars."

Minecraft,fdjdk2e,t3_elnfec,1578466380.0,I like it because it looks good *and* I still can tell what everything is. That's the main reason I don't use texture packs: it's difficult to adjust to

CastleTV,fdg5s8l,t3_el4wn5,1578381156.0,"I don't think there's a legal way to do it. You can take your chance with a torrent, but honestly you can buy the whole series on DVD on eBay for less than $60, which is a small price to pay to own it forever if you love the show"

Renewable energy is the future but is not currently in any state to support the world. It's expensive and inefficient; it needs to be improved to the point where it's viable as a primary source of energy, then can be implemented on a mass scale."

cats,fdf4eoe,t3_ekym3c,1578353053.0,"Consider a decoy. ""Mirroring,"" which provides something similar to what you're doing for your cat, is actually really healthy for them. They love you and want to be involved, and providing them a way to do that without interfering with what you're doing is a good idea. In the case of books, have a second book in your lap for your cat to lay on."
Libertarian,fdcpx4l,t3_ekekrr,1578281083.0,"Genuine question here from someone conflicted on this issue: what do you think will happen if the US doesn't intervene and prevent enemy superpowers from exploring their interests unchecked? Are you okay watching innocent people suffer?

I also want to drastically reduce defense spending and think scaling back our involvement is a major part of that, but there's concerns."
IsItBullshit,fdcpn27,t3_eki46x,1578280877.0,"There's no requirement that it be offered by employers. If it's important to you, then you choose an employer that offers it. I'm just a manager at a pizza chain, but as long as I maintain an average of 37 hours a week, I'm considered full-time and get two weeks of PTO and five paid holidays for a total of 19 days. I'm 21 and have only been full-time for a year."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,fcy8xrz,t1_fcxyfjh,1578076514.0,"You make the mistake of equating good service with a good tip. There's plenty of people out there who receive good service all the time and tip poorly, if at all. Now, we all know that and accept that's part of the job, but this guy takes it further by trying to *round down* his bill and then will cancel after the order leaves the store, which is fucked up. I personally wouldn't have done what OP did, but I do understand it. 

Sometimes it's genuinely not worth keeping the customer, and something tells me that no one is going to shed a tear if this guy never orders again."
