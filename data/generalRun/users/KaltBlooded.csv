MagicArena,fev33ym,t3_eqkqzh,1579392609.0,"This is really what I needed. The start of every new set feels kind of meh to me. I save up close to 40k gold, buy some packs, open them and get 50/50 good and bad rares. Sadly this leaves me with too few rares for any let's call it ""real"" deck, so I end up sticking with old decks. Don't want to waste rare WC on some rare that worked well in 2 of that one streamers game so.. it's a month of waiting before crafting and playing the new set..   
Except now I just play your deck! Thank you so much!"

learnpython,fdwofbi,t3_eklk3r,1578760836.0,"I am currently working on a little project of myself and ran into a problem while trying to import my own code.

I have the following structure:

src

\-- folderA

\---- a1.py

\---- a2.py (with ClassA2)

\-- folderB

\---- b1.py

I am looking to use a2 (more specific ClassA2) in my b1 file and a2 itself uses a1 (a Class in a1). When trying `import folderA` or `import folderA.a2` with `folderA.ClassA2`/`folderA.a2.ClassA2` (in b2), I get ""AttributeError: module folderA has no attribute ClassA2"" in the first case and ""ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'a1' "" in the second case.

I could really use some help please. Feel free to ask for more info if needed!

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** Adding an `__init__.py` file with `import a1` and `import a2` into folderA, then using `folderA.ClassA2` in b2 leads to ""ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'a1' "" aswell. With the error now from the `__init__.py` file."

magicTCG,fcf2uou,t3_ebtvc8,1577626112.0,Hey! I got into Magic with MtG Arena recently and really enjoy playing Brawl. Now I am at a point where I want to start playing in paper aswell and want to try some Commander. I just don't know where to start with a Commander deck at all. Like how to best decide on what Commander to play or what cards to get first when you're on a budget etc. I'd really appreciate some general help!

So play for a bit, enjoy the world and then come back and look at what there is to do with studded you found or items and stuff you haven't found. You'll have double the amount of 'Ohhhh' moments."

MagicArena,fc6asdf,t3_egfno9,1577476228.0,'Mtggoldfish' is a great site to look for decklists. Under the tournament - standard tab you find current well performing (standard) lists with possibilities to import the decklist into arena. Might find a decklist to build towards there. And welcome to arena!
