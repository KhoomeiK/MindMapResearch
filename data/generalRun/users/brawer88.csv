I'll keep in mind that one day I might feel smothered. I think that when I do, I'll understand why it's happening and I think I'll be ok with it. Who knows though. Only time will tell.

But we shared our childhoods and past relationships to a degree anyway and I recognized myself in what she was saying. I don't believe she claimed to be codependent too but she said she reached out to a counselor specializing in that, among other issues resulting from adverse childhood experiences. 

Those three love languages though are mine lmao. I tied those three when I took the test as my top ones. Love it. 

I hear you saying that about feeling smothered. But right now I can't imagine me ever feeling that way. But I will stay on guard if we end up moving forward and make it that far. 

As for hobbies staying - I'm in school and that will take up a good portion of my free time. And it's something I won't bend boundaries on. I *need* to finish. 4.0 so far and I plan on keeping it that way. 

I apologize for the confusion concerning the avoidant."
Codependency,feyh7pp,t1_feyfyio,1579445513.0,"You are absolutely right and totally spot in with the description of my relationship with her. It was bad. I went to therapy because of it actually. I'm not in the throes of it I don't think. Not anymore. The thing with the avoidant recently died again, but I won't go back to her. I hope I don't anyway. I have nothing but nice thoughts for her, but yes that's done and if she reaches out to me I'll be nice. But we are done. She made it very clear she can't give me what I need/want. And that all I do is another her lmao. Is what it is. I grieved it the first time and knew the second time it would happen again but had to try. She's been through a lot and that's what allowed me to forgive her what happened. It isn't her fault. It isn't mine either. We just can't work. 

There's someone new I'm talking to that made me ask this question. More specifically she might have an anxious attachment style too. And it makes me wonder. I know I have issues and I'm working on finding my ""validation"" from within. I've found a modicum of self love in recent times. I think that'll keep growing."
Codependency,feyclme,t1_fexuxo9,1579443790.0,"Oh there we go. That's the reason I believe I'm codependent. I ignore my needs for theirs and believe I'm doing it out of ""love"". Or to be the savior as it were. In fact, I'm an anxious attachment style too. The last person I was with was avoidant. She'd get close and then pull away. I don't know what it was about her but I'd do anything for her. It was insane and completely and utterly the most pain I've ever felt, but also didn't want to leave or be left. Fear of being abandoned is what drives my codependency I think. If only I can *prove* I am good enough then someone will *keep* me. It's completely insane. It does feel like survival. This is probably the most complete definition of my codependency. Thank you for your response.

I've always just wanted someone to want me too. Could a fellow anxious attachment style codependent lead us both to a secure attachment style? That's my hope. I've never even talked to someone who *might* be the same as me. I don't know yet but I think she might be. 

It's weird. The women I date have dictated the level of my codependency. Like some of them, I've kept my boundaries and left because it was clear it wouldn't work or they were absolutely untrustworthy. But then, with the avoidant - I was cheated on openly and I stayed with her after. I completely removed all my boundaries for her. I had none with her. But the pain you described is how it ended up ending twice (we tried again recently). I couldn't take it anymore and had to end it. I just wanted her to want me but she never did, until I left. Then she wanted/wants me. Haha. 

But maybe if she has the same codependency as me, I wonder. Would it turn into a secure attachment because we both are like ""ah someone wants me"" lmao. I don't know. We've only just started talking. I'm sure I'll update Reddit with it wherever it leads."
Codependency,feyangg,t1_fexffnz,1579443061.0,"Thank you for this detailed response:) 

I believe I'm codependent. The woman I'm talking to expresses similar kind of feelings, and we had similar childhoods (the root of my codependent tendencies). We both did an over-sharing bit way too soon too haha. 

I tend to smother some people and those same people are the ones that make me feel inadequate haha. That vicious cycle is why I think I'm codependent. But then, I tend to run away from the people that are healthy. So I don't know."

During that time though (when some seriously hard stuff happened) I learned that focusing on my breath was a remarkable way to alleviate the pain in my chest. And I learned a lot about mindfulness. I'm still depressed I believe, but in a much different way. I accept it I think. I'm mindful of my feelings and I use my breathing to ground me in the present. And that keeps me from the past or future, where my emotions arise from.

bisexual,fcxr32p,t1_fcxqusu,1578069329.0,I feel that. I wish I had a suggestion for you.
bisexual,fcxqfkq,t1_fcxp2oa,1578068999.0,That definitely stinks :(
AskMen,fcxnwpe,t1_fcxl1nw,1578067405.0,"Thank you. I was going to point out the difference too. Maybe the ""nice guys"" could be described as the insecure guys they are that employ those tactics to elicit the attention they need and then become cold ass wipes. A new term should be made to distinguish the two. Being nice is possible, while also being empathetic and confident and having strong character."

bisexual,fcxkect,t1_fcxa098,1578065080.0,What did your friends do to mess up?
askwomenadvice,fcxidjc,t3_ejg0t7,1578063683.0,"From personal experience, I can say what not to do. Don't over share on those first few dates. Quick way to not get a second date haha. 

But otherwise, just be you. Be relaxed with who you are and just be. It may go great and it may not. If it doesn't, oh well. You'll have more dates that will go well."
