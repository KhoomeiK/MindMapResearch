loseit,fctbxjo,t3_eigz8p,1577938494.0,"I’m doing this again.

I’m an obsessive near-bedtime snacker. In 2012 I went from 230 lbs to 170 lbs. I’m up to 215 now... time for a tune up.

I’m going to use My Fitness Pal as a calorie tracker and do an Intermittent Fasting schedule to keep me from snacking. I’m using a 16-8 schedule. This is going to be a good year!

My goal is to be able to look good in a swimsuit, as I did a few years back.  I have a Nike racer suit that I want to get back into."

travel,fc8vp3v,t3_egitpn,1577542769.0,"Depends on what they are looking for. Cancun/Playa Del Carmen has beaches and nearby Z Mayan ruins. 

If you are looking for history, Guadalajara is the place to go. It’s also close to Tequila, the birthplace of the booze.

They are not close to each other, so if they are looking for a beach/city combo Better to do Guadalajara/Manzanillo trip."
