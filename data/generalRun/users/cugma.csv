facepalm,fg1kg2r,t1_fg1j1rp,1580428699.0,"Question for you. Are you aware of how many animals in the food industry die before they even reach the slaughterhouse because of how atrocious conditions are and how disposable we view their lives as being? Are you as indignant about any of those millions upon millions as you are this one case?

Or is this just selective, self-righteous outrage at work?"
facepalm,fg1jzs4,t1_fg1j1rp,1580428478.0,"What are you even on about? Talking about egregious mistakes and accountability is one thing, this crusade that PETA is anti pets and steals and kills them is completely different. They were charged and punished per the law they broke. What more exactly do you want? Why is the court of law not good enough for you?"
facepalm,fg1igww,t1_fg1hnx5,1580427703.0,"Right, no well-meaning person or company has ever broken a law before that ended up hurting someone.

It would be amazing if people gave even a fraction as much of a fuck about the animals on their plates as they do this one-off tragedy."
facepalm,fg1i9w7,t1_fg1hkef,1580427597.0,"Sooo you admit they euthanized a pet intentionally “because they don’t believe in pet ownership” isn’t supported and the idea that they intentionally steal and kill pets is absolute bullshit?

Can you really not see that you aren’t approaching this topic with any kind of level headed-ness? PETA euthanizes animals because there are literally millions of unwanted pets and we don’t have the resources to care for them."

facepalm,fg1gea5,t1_fg151gi,1580426627.0,"Maya was left outside with no humans around with no collar or identification when it was understood PETA would be coming by to pick up unwanted strays in the area. Not wearing a collar is actually extremely relevant.

It was a heartbreaking accident but this idea that there’s some systematic plan to steal and kill pets is so ludicrous I’m worried about people’s critical thinking skills."

AmItheAsshole,fepfnk1,t3_eq24av,1579319311.0,"ESH - People tend to judge most harshly in others what they judge most harshly in themselves. The fact that she’s had so many procedures added to her judgement of the physical appearance of others indicates she has extreme self-image and insecurity struggles. 

I completely understand frustration over the seeming hypocrisy of her judgement, but it seems like her actions are much more a case of projection, and by calling out her procedures like that you dumped her greatest vulnerabilities on the table in the most painful way. As her family, it could’ve been handled with more empathy."

VeganForCircleJerkers,fdrhun6,t3_emqqv6,1578684664.0,"I grew up on a beef ranch owned by my father and participated some. Grew up riding horses, raised pigs for 4-H that were slaughtered at the end of the summer, dreamed of one day being a racehorse jockey, and sometimes went on family hunts (though I was never really much of a hunter, I only participated in one dove hunt). My father's house has an entire room dedicated to hunting trophies, and I've even been on actual trophy hunts, like those safari trophy hunts that everyone hates, and have actively celebrated and encouraged killing.

Hate is a strong word, but it's pretty safe to say veganism is the exact opposite of the world I grew up in. What little thought I gave to vegans was purely to view them as overly emotional sissies who were out to destroy our way of life, to the point where calling someone a vegan would be viewed as an insult.

Things change, apparently."

Apparently he was among those interested when the trend first started hitting the team, but Charity (wife of Derrick Morgan who made the plant based meals for the team) had to turn him away because she couldn’t handle feeding any more of them. Unfortunately I can’t find any place that lists all of the players who are part of the plant-based group, only the ones who started it, so it’s possible he started doing it himself instead of as part of Charity’s group."

worldnews,fd2nv5j,t1_fd2d0n8,1578149883.0,Or their real pledge is to donate their money after they die and they realize it’s easier to make money with money. And they realize that a lot of their efforts require money so they can’t give it all away in one swift move.
