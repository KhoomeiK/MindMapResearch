AskReddit,fdpd4ec,t1_fdpcz2x,1578625603.0,"Another user pointed out the biggest flaw... we have a revolving door of leadership, and they don’t. If they can just outlast, they win. So either Trump needs to hold strong, or if a Dem is elected, let’s hope they continue the fight instead of walking away and making it a partisan thing."
AskReddit,fdpclsy,t1_fdpcfe9,1578625247.0,"You have some great points here, I appreciate your perspective!"
AskReddit,fdpchge,t1_fdpc5qd,1578625164.0,"Economics isn’t necessarily political, I mean it is, but it’s the same regardless of what side chooses the policy. I think we need to focus on why we’re doing this rather than who (Trump) decides to start it... I’d support Chinese tariffs regardless of who enacted (Clinton, Obama) because I believe it needed to be done"
AskReddit,fdpc9gc,t1_fdpc031,1578625012.0,"Yup, you’re still right. We would pay more, at the cost of paying for what a product is actually worth (arguably, again assuming you agree with worth it to pay more for products to give living wages to employees)."
AskReddit,fdpc2ya,t1_fdpbyfi,1578624888.0,"The same reason America did after the steel era, gotta evolve from a manf economy once your population advances."
AskReddit,fdpbuqh,t1_fdpbim6,1578624731.0,"Nope, not saying that at all. Well, kind of. I’m saying it would make it possible, and I have little to no faith China will give any sort of rights like that to its workers. I would rather give a chance to a country that values humans as humans"
AskReddit,fdpbnxk,t1_fdpbg7n,1578624601.0,Exactly. I just can’t justify sitting on the sideline of a potential future Holocaust to justify cheaper iPhones or Nikes... just seems asinine to me
AskReddit,fdpbkt5,t1_fdpa4fe,1578624541.0,"No, no American consumers benefit here unless you factor the intangibles such as human rights or whatever is important to you. Very well said."
AskReddit,fdpbdta,t1_fdpba3p,1578624405.0,"Tariffs, and agreed, we should probably leave it at that lol"
AskReddit,fdpbath,t1_fdpb5o3,1578624349.0,"I don’t think you’ve read up too much on China’s earnings calls... things are looking grim for them. Again, tariffs are about who can outlast who, and I believe we can outlast them. For the greater good of the common man internationally"
AskReddit,fdpb62i,t1_fdpaqal,1578624258.0,"No, because if we transition to Mexico, we’d be paying higher labor costs, because Mexico isn’t nearly as bad as China. Those employees wouldn’t be exploited nearly as badly. Your second point is valid. I personally am willing to pay higher prices because I believe it will help society as a whole (internationally)."
AskReddit,fdpaznt,t1_fdpariq,1578624139.0,"No not quite. The things going on over there aren’t just because of tariffs... but if their entire economy starts crumbling because democratic nations don’t like the shit they’re doing, maybe if consumption drops enough they’ll reconsider and I think that’s the whole point."
AskReddit,fdpauvl,t1_fdpan7m,1578624050.0,"Uhhhh what haha. Tariffs raise their prices, and therefore decrease consumption cause of the golden rule of Economic: consumers are rational and will buy at best price. So I guess you’re kind of right, it flows freely, but (ideally) not illogically"
AskReddit,fdpaoz0,t1_fdpadr7,1578623939.0,"You nailed it. The tariffs are only effective if other countries aren’t selfish dicks that try to capitalize on what we’re trying to accomplish. If they don’t, they could potentially benefit eventually. Personally, I think it’s worth putting China in check finally and stepping up for the normal joe"
AskReddit,fdpaiff,t1_fdpaak1,1578623815.0,"Yeah see I guess we fundamentally disagree then, because I’d like to see China digress, not improve. But that’s just my opinion... I don’t see China doing human rights a huge favor in the future and the more control they have over the economy, the more control they have over our human rights. They’re already trying to censor American companies lol"
AskReddit,fdpacwd,t1_fdpa437,1578623713.0,"Are you familiar with the genocide going on over there? Honk Kong? Currency manipulation? Patent theft? Yes, I do thing the prices are worth bettering our worldwide society... the first rule of investing in stocks is to diversify, and we need to do that badly."
AskReddit,fdpa5ut,t1_fdpa2w0,1578623580.0,"So you wouldn’t complain about war, with a nuclear nation and an army the size comparable to ours? This seems... less drastic"
AskReddit,fdp9zse,t1_fdp9gl0,1578623467.0," Not yet, but if this tariff policy forces many countries to find new sources of labor, it will. It will force China to find new means, and it won’t be able to exploit its labor nearly as much.I don’t see a way you could do this without a trade war."
AskReddit,fdp9sma,t1_fdp9feg,1578623335.0,"To be honest, the American farmer hasn’t factored into my opinion whatsoever. We’re so heavily subsidized that any sort of competition we’re currently offering is artificial anyways."
AskReddit,fdp9pm8,t1_fdp9dv5,1578623280.0,"Depends how you look at it, I was speaking purely in terms of price of product (cost of labor). If we have to go to a better country, we may pay the price by well, paying more... the question is if stopping/reducing exploiting kids in manf plants, genocide, and whatever else is going in China, offsets a higher price on consumer products. I don’t know about you, but I’m willing to pay more to help out my fellow humans. I don’t need an IPhone or shoes that bad man"
AskReddit,fdp9g7j,t1_fdp9440,1578623110.0,"Thanks man, my downvotes are everywhere. You’re right, small businesses can’t withstand this nearly as well... I guess it comes down to weather or not weaning off China is worth that exchange."
AskReddit,fdp9aqm,t1_fdp90ec,1578623011.0,"I don’t know and no one does. Tariffs are supposed to equalize the negotiations. After that, we’ll know. Personally, unless China has major changes to human rights, I would much rather pay higher prices as a consumer than feel guilty about teens jumping off buildings in manf facilities. Maybe that’s just me though. Mexico is a great alternative, just saying."
AskReddit,fdp939e,t1_fdp8q2e,1578622875.0,"Also correct, these are all the things that must be considered when evaluating if this is worth it. Personally, I think decreasing support to a country that won’t support a democratic vision and is actively committing genocide may be worth it. I also acknowledge others may think these atrocities are worth it for cheap iPhones and shoes."
AskReddit,fdp8s1h,t1_fdp8i4r,1578622667.0,"Do you mind pointing out my incoherent comments? I’m simply trying to point out tariffs punish both sides, and given China ya know... committing genocide etc, it seems worth it to pay a little more on products to find a new supplier, amongst the other obvious reasons."
AskReddit,fdp8miy,t1_fdp62op,1578622565.0,"I would totally agree with almost all of that, except I don’t recall any recent presidents being willing to put any tariff on China, so this is gonna be interesting"
AskReddit,fdp8fcf,t1_fdp87ur,1578622430.0,"I totally agree, but you failed to mention how the tariffs are also paid by the supplier, seeing as decrease in demand for their product due to higher prices leads to less income and consumers..."
AskReddit,fdp8913,t1_fdp6gdf,1578622311.0,"You’re correct for sure. It absolutely hurts businesses and their margins. It may not even be American manufacturing that benefits, but if we transition from Chinese to say Mexican labor, American consumers will benefit from reduced cost from tariff imposed prices. May not be as good as it was from the start, but that’s the question that you ask when you’re deciding whether or not to implement them in the first place."
AskReddit,fdp80p9,t1_fdp79zz,1578622153.0,"You’re still missing the picture bud. The long term goal is that we’re then able to find a more reasonable price for the products we’re buying from a new supplier, or new rate from existing. Also, you just did a 100% spin on your initial stance that it only hurts USA lol"
AskReddit,fdp5yqf,t1_fdp5pmm,1578620779.0,"Nah man,  not The NY Times article lol. The part where you understand that tariffs certainly affect the supplier as well. Did the even mention which products? Consumer prices go up, and either we find new suppliers, or they have to adjust their rate to reach equilibrium again."
AskReddit,fdp52za,t1_fdp4vex,1578620186.0,You’re successfully grasping 50% of the picture. Keep reading bud
AskReddit,fdp4zsy,t1_fdp4ooy,1578620126.0,Thank you for being in this thread
AskReddit,fdp4xpy,t1_fdp47v8,1578620088.0,Jesus dude please research tariffs. They are absolutely detrimental to Americans IN THE SHORT TERM. At least that’s the goal.
AskReddit,fdp4sdk,t1_fdp2ikk,1578619990.0,Uhhhh it doesn’t only fall on the consumer. The supplier also just lost that respective consumer so.....
AskReddit,fdp4p4b,t1_fdp49gw,1578619930.0,"Check my other reply in the thread. It’s a long term plan, you can’t be so short sighted."
AskReddit,fdp4kqc,t1_fdp4as7,1578619850.0,"You’re 100% correct; We’re making a big bet that China’s financial outlook is going to continue to weaken, and we’ll finally have leverage at the negotiating table. Also, if we want to wean off China, you have to start somewhere. It’s going to be painful, but it’ll be beneficial in long term seeing the 2 countries clearly have very different LTPs. These same guys will complain about the way Hong Kong is treated, how China is exploiting labor/currency/patents, then circle around to simultaneously complain about the tariffs cause republicans implemented the policy. It’s hilarious"
AskReddit,fdp45ag,t1_fdp422k,1578619564.0,"Take Econ 101 my dude, they’ll probably cover this in the first 15 minutes after going supply and demand curves"
