Seattle,ffpsxir,t3_eubewx,1580104528.0,I loved this!  Thanks for finding!
bipolar,ffpopgk,t3_euh6yt,1580100546.0,"It’s worth it.  I’m on the other side.  Beautiful new friendships, discovering things I love, finding clothes that make me feel wonderful, enjoying trips so never would have imagined going on.

It’s worth it.  Stick it out."
bipolar,ffpo9kj,t3_euikxj,1580100174.0,"Well, most people have constant access to both energy and intentionality.  My mother once told a story about she was SOOOO distracted one day that she walks into a room and saw that she had *started* vacuuming but had walked away and not finished.  

And I was like “Wait....are you telling me you FINISH chores?  Like one at a time you start then finish??”

I think we have such great swings in energy that we get used to kinda juggling all the time.   

Maybe it’s more like we are trying to balance a bunch of plates while standing on a boat in a rough ocean.  Everyone else is standing on land.  And then they’re like “This really isn’t hard- see, watch!”  And no matter how hard we try we just can’t DO what looks so easy!  

But it’s because we are in this constant state of flux that requires careful maneuvering just to maintain basic minimums in food, and shelter, and relationships."
bipolar,ffk87os,t3_eu29du,1580018564.0,I feel this in my gut.
bipolar,ffk05gj,t1_ffiy98q,1580011783.0,I took mine to my doc and he scrolled through asking questions. I found it very helpful.
bipolar,ffjzplb,t3_etuudx,1580011414.0,Mine’s just extreme lethargy.  I wake up after sleeping 8 hours feeling like I never slept....then I go back to bed and stay there for a week or two.  Strangely I don’t get sad when I’m depressed.  Just feel like something is sucking the life force out of me.
bipolar,ffjyspd,t3_etx4g0,1580010691.0,"In the worst way.  It’s taken a lot of effort, and quite a few “healthy” days, but I’ve found the Getting Things Done method by David Allen to really work for me, as far as moving things from procrastination into action. 

There’s actually an article about Procrastination being an EMOTIONAL issue.   [Here. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/smarter-living/why-you-procrastinate-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-self-control.amp.html)  And we have MOOD disorders, so it makes sense that procrastination would be a part of that."
bipolar,ffjxtu6,t3_etz2xv,1580009922.0,Long hot shower.  Coloring or scribbling. Listening to loud music in headphones somehow uses energy for me even if I’m not moving. Being wrapped really tightly in a blanket helps calm my skin (or layers of heavy blankets.)
bipolar,ffjxk46,t3_etz5j3,1580009707.0,"I have a friend who has bipolar 2 and she never has euphoria like me.  Hers is more of a mixed state where she feels extremely intense anxiety, suicidal thoughts, desire to self-harm, and anger.  That’s her “up.”"
bipolar,ffjwolk,t1_ffgmjvd,1580009006.0,"Ok. Well Then, “from one bipolar woman with low libido to another bipolar woman with low libido.”  

What can  I say?  I actually have really poor sense of smell and don’t actually enjoy the taste of food as much as most people I think.  Maybe I have low “enjoyment”?   

That certainly has nothing to do with my partner.

When I’m hypomanic, I certainly laugh and giggle and play and dance and enjoy sex more, so maybe it truly is based in brain chemicals.  

Incidentally, when I’m pregnant with boys my libido is below zero.  The idea of sex almost makes me throw up.  And when I’m pregnant with girls I’m probably on par with most guys in that anywhere anytime would be a good time for sex.     So, there’s something hormonal going on there that also has nothing to do with my partner, who was the same person in both scenarios."
bipolar,ffh11sc,t3_etkv0x,1579920251.0,"Just ask for a full psychological work up.  Tell
Them you know something is wrong but haven’t been able to figure it out.  They’ll go from there."
bipolar,ffgsd2d,t3_etjh2n,1579913823.0,"Nope- I have it for iPhone.  Love it. 

I really wish we could see
More than 1 month at a time though

Edit: There is a way!! Yay!"
bipolar,ffggk16,t3_ethng2,1579905741.0,"I have a pretty low libido.  Here’s what has worked for us:

*“Turning the crockpot on”* (crockpots take all day to cook something). My hubby had to let me know in a non-pushy way that he’d really love some action tonight- hours ahead of time.

*Being aware of energy*- I am very low energy at night.  I can make it until 8:30 or 9, and then the bottom falls out and I can’t even keep my eyes open.  So, if we tuck the kids into bed at 8:30, then watch a tv show, there’s no chance for anything happening once the energy is gone ....and I have very poor ability to predict it.

   So, last night I knew I reallllly needed to make sex happen.  We tucked the kids in bed, snuggled up for a movie, and I tried to really stay aware of when I was blinking slower.  We immediately stopped the show and moved into action.


*Just get started*- Many  women don’t actually enjoy sex for the first 5-8 minutes.  Like, it’s nice to kiss, but why are you touching me?  Do I really need to take my clothes off, I’m comfortable...I’ll be cold! I’m just not feeling it.

But most women after lots of foreplay (and foreplay may be cleaning the kitchen together, having a talk about money issues, locking the front door and turning out lights, having the bedroom door locked and candles going.....she’s not trying to be difficult.  She just can’t relax and want to have sex if she feels vulnerable or has a million things on her mind.).  Anyway, after lots of foreplay, and then after actually starting penetrative sex, it still can take a few minutes for the fun to start for some women.


So, in our marriage I have to acknowledge that we might be having sex just for his benefit.  I enjoy that he’s enjoying it, but it’s still completely a chore for me.  But about 75% of the time it will start out a chore, and I’ll be having a fabulous time by the end.  And I’ll say “ok you’re right, that was a great idea!!”  

But both parties need to be OK with the woman not orgasming, and doing it out of love rather than pleasure, in order for her to be willing to expend the energy to have kinda meh sex...:that might eventually turn into fantastic sex.

My husband really had a hang up about this, because he felt like he had failed if I didn’t have a blast. But he didn’t do anything wrong.  My hormones or the stars didn’t align for me to be able to enjoy it fully, but even then I was glad we did it- for his pleasure and also as a way of reconnecting.  
So we had to normalize sex “for his benefit”. 

He’ll even say that out loud -“is this for your benefit or mine?” Because if I’m having a great time, then I want to do this all the way until I orgasm. But if I am never in a million years going to orgasm, then I would rather he hurry to the conclusion, because as I said I am already completely out of energy.

Does that make sense??"
