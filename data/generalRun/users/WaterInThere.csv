Senators were originally elected by State Legislatures. This gave state governments a direct voice in Federal Government. The Senate was supposed to be the house of the ""Educated Elite"" while the House was for the unwashed masses. 

The fact that it gave equal representation to states, and more specifically to state governments, was important to getting the early States to buy into the Constitution since it assured them they'd be able to stop the masses from just voting all power to a Federal government that promised to pay them. The disproportionate representation of the people wasn't considered a drawback because, again, the House would serve as their voice.

yeah, exactly, because that is what S42 was explicitly sold as. I'll definitely check it out when it releases considering I already payed for thing seven years ago (wow I had to look that up I had forgotten how long it had been. S42 original release date in 2014) so I'm very curious what they've been doing all this time. 

I've tried a couple of times to check out the progress they've made. I put a couple hours in the dogfighting mode when it was released. Occasionally I want to check it out but every time I open the game the launcher needs to download like 50 gigs of updates. Then reinstall itself. Or I need to uninstall the launcher and get a new one.  

When I have successfully loaded in nothing I've seen has really impressed me to be honest. I've only really check out my hangar and done a little flying, but the FPS movement felt super...weird. And I have a ton of hangar doodads from being an early backer but can't figure out how to place them because of the UI. I had to alt-tab out and google how to actually get my ships to load.

One of the things that excited me most was the real style flight physics we were promised, and those do seem to be working but they're also very complex, and Imma be real and say I'm just not willing to put in the work to git gud at them until there's a game for to play.
