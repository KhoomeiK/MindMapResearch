Patriots,ffrydfa,t1_ffrxbjm,1580168715.0,It’s a quote by Kobe showing he respected Tom Brady.  Seems alright for an individual post.
Patriots,ffry9kr,t1_ffrx5cb,1580168644.0,"So because of that Kobe can’t complement Tom
Brady?  I don’t get the point if your comment."

technews,ff511ig,t1_ff4xyxg,1579577347.0,"I said in my original comment that I used google still because of compatibility and better ease of use lmao.  I’ve pretty much given up being totally secure and the government is going to get my info no matter what.  

I think they’re both about equal when it comes to network security of their apps and data, which is what you’re talking about.  The only place I said Apple wins is when it comes to telling the government to fuck off.  For example the government still insists they can’t hack an iPhone publicly.


There’s not a single article i can see that confirmed Apples cloud got hacked.  Only ones that speculate.  You can’t just say a group of similar people got hacked therefore the entire system was hacked that’s not how it works.  Like I said more famous people just use Apple products therefore they get an article written when they accidentally leak their password somehow by social engineering or when people use duplicate passwords on systems that were hacked."
technews,ff4xoec,t1_ff4w4i7,1579574934.0,"All of those hacks are from mismanaging credentials before two factor authentication was a thing.  I would be willing to bet at least a few google users have mismanaged their credentials.  If you search google drive hacked you can see tons of posts and articles about the same situation from normal people.

I can’t find a single reputable article that says iCloud has had any major confirmed hacks outside of people not knowing how to keep accounts secure."
technews,ff4to0n,t1_ff4ke91,1579572183.0,"What has Apple done that google hasn’t?  Apple has a better record of standing up to the government from what I know, but I use google more often still just because Its what I’ve gotten used to.  I definitely agree with Facebook and tik tok though."

politics,fegxunx,t1_fegvivd,1579104947.0,I think he’s saying it’s positive if your goal is to remain in power.  It gives your party an advantage when choosing party over country.
AskReddit,fdp7z0b,t1_fdp6qn5,1578622121.0,"When talking about investments and growth both matter equally.  Especially compared to inflation.  You can’t logically separate them.

That’s why people care about gdp growth percentage so much."
AskReddit,fdp6hgi,t1_fdp59io,1578621130.0,"9,000 vs 18,000 lol.  And percentage growth matters the most for investors."
