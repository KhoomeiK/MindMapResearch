rpa,ffwwcpq,t1_ffw876e,1580312510.0,Also support contracts. That way when something goes south you're not waiting for your one dev to come into the office or answer his phone on vacation. You just call the support line and get an answer and help asap.
sffpc,ffwn355,t1_ffwc7sz,1580305997.0,"It's it at least a standard barrel or USB C connector? Lenovo has their stupid proprietary rectangle connectors for their M series Tiny desktops, even though the laptops switched to USB C three years ago."
ynab,ffwkhvq,t1_ffwiqc2,1580303898.0,"I pay in full, so it should zero out, shouldn't it?"
ynab,ffwkf0e,t1_ffwjvq1,1580303831.0,"I do imports primarily. I've been trying to get better about manually inputting transactions on my phone but I never remember. That's a good point, most of my bills are in the first week of the month so I end up paying them during the last week of the prior month. Shouldn't the categories carry over though?"
ynab,ffwjmng,t1_ffwiqj4,1580303150.0,"No returns and I don't do cash back rewards except in tiny amounts. My ""total earned"" (so actual cash back amount) on my Sapphire is like $22 total since last June and this is a monthly thing well into the $30-50/mo range."
ynab,ffwj5ol,t1_ffwiko6,1580302732.0,"I mostly do points instead of taking the cash back. Chase does have the occasional cash back from their vendor deals but it's usually like $2-5/mo, not the $30-50 that it ends up being ""under budgeted"" according to ynab."
ynab,ffwhoc7,t1_ffwgxx1,1580301358.0,"Been doing it for over a year and it's still fucking confusing. I put all my spend on CCs then pay them off monthly, and somehow ynab still finds a way to tell me I'm under budget  on my cc payments almost every time, even though all my actual budget categories are in the green or exactly zero? And this isn't a preexisting balance error, I've had ynab longer than I've had these CCs, so we started from zero."

sffpc,ffuts5b,t1_ffumli5,1580249192.0,Lol our MSP was ordering us low-spec M93s when the M910q's were already out. When we took IT in house we started getting M900's and M910q's with 16GB RAM and 500GB SSDs. Life is much faster now.
nespresso,ffspvrl,t3_ev0fik,1580188346.0,"For most pods, if you pull that second shot into a separate glass and compare the two, one looks like espresso, the other looks like watered down coffee. Not worth it IMO, just use the second pod if you want a double shot."

beatsaber,ffr7i56,t3_eupaug,1580152137.0,"You know, with the strong anime following in this game's community, I would not be surprised to hear someone has created a cat paw custom saber."
sffpc,ffqzpa1,t1_ffqwgdv,1580147260.0,Yeah I rarely use front panel audio but I do use front USB A kind of often. I should just 3d print a front panel with no USB C or headphone jack.
casualiama,ffqwlhd,t3_euo8fe,1580145290.0,"I got someone fired with a fart before. The guy never liked me, and was not ingratiating himself with anyone else in the office either. I let one out that I thought was going to be quiet and small, but ended up being really loud. I was of course mortified but the guy yelled ""go to the bathroom, asshole"". I did get a deserved talking-to about office manners, but he got his contact terminated like a week later."
sffpc,ffqbxg9,t3_eujqjt,1580129735.0,I made customs for my GPU and SATA connectors last night.  Just go slow and triple check all your pinouts and you'll be good.
sffpc,ffqb9n0,t1_ffpwzca,1580129052.0,"See my lower comment for the link to Global Entry. It's still a US thing, but it is expedited re-entry through customs and screening."
sffpc,ffpm232,t1_ffjb3vg,1580098409.0,"I saw a post somewhere that someone used a tophat between two cases to create a double Ghost. I'll see if I can find it, it was pretty funny.

sffpc,ffpitui,t1_ffpea3h,1580096076.0,"I too had an Ophion Evo before my Ncase, and while it looked pretty cool, I wasn't terribly enthused with the temps I was getting on either my GPU or CPU. I just wish the dang USB3 cable was maybe 6"" instead of the foot and a half that it is."
