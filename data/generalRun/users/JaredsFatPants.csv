SandersForPresident,ffjxeuj,t1_ffj8mcs,1580009589.0,It’s actually stolen from a conservative plan created by the heritage foundation. So maybe his name should be on that piece of crap.

My doc just cut it out during a regular office visit. I can’t remember exactly but I think I just paid for a normal office visit.

SandersForPresident,ffjtf3f,t1_ffix32t,1580006452.0,"Yep, they will find a way to charge you when they don’t have to tell you ahead of time what everything costs. I went to the ER when I had a kidney stone. They put me in an MRI machine which cost about $4k. Other than that I got some iv painkillers and the total was about $7k. A few years later I had another kidney stone and went to the ER again. I told them that I didn’t want an MRI because I had no insurance and couldn’t afford it. Well when I got the bill it was $8k! The MRI was not on the bill. I didn’t even get inside a room in the hospital. They just put me in a gurney in the hallway for about 45 minutes, gave me pain meds, and sent me on my way. $8k for that. Next time I’m going to the city and scoring some heroin. It’ll be much cheaper for the same level of care."
SandersForPresident,ffjspyl,t1_ffjpiwr,1580005918.0,"Good question. Bernie said that if democratic congress people and senators don’t back M4A he will campaign against their reelection. But after we see how Bernie caved when someone in his campaign suggested Biden was corrupt, and he apologized for it, I don’t have a lot of hope that Bernie has the backbone to fight the democratic establishment."

She stood up for what she believed (I’m referring to backing Sanders in 2016) knowing full well that it would have extremely negative consequences to her standing in the Democratic Party and her future electability. No banks are going to be giving her $400K to talk for an hour. She did that because she thought it was the right thing for the American people regardless of how it would negatively affect her.

She’s only a Democrat in name. I agree with AOC that the Democratic Party is not a left party. They should actually want single-payer health care. They should have been supporting the protesters at Standing Rock. They should be for ending forever wars. They should be supportive of Bernie. They should be talking about issues instead of blaming everyone else for their faults. They shouldn’t be casually smearing people they don’t like as Russians. They should be treating people with respect, even ones they don’t agree with. Tulsi is all these things that the Democratic Party is not. But what are you going to do when we have a two party system?

I asked if I could have a canned soda. They said no, which I get. So I just said ok well can I get a free drink next time I come in? They said no, only on thursday. I was seriously flabbergasted. Really? You can’t give me a free soda, that I’m entitled to, on a different day to make up for it? Then they said they don’t have anyway to do that. They could have just wrote “free soda” on a piece of paper and had the manager sign it. I was a little peeved at this point because it was so ridiculous. I said “so there’s no way I can get a free soda even though your huge sign right here says I get a free soda if I make a purchase on Thursday”? And their answer was “You can come back next Thursday and by something else.”  It’s a fountain soda. It probably cost them $.10.

Let’s also assume Liz was being truthful when she said that she and Bernie are good friends.     
    
Then, it’s likely that if Warren heard Bernie say he didn’t think a woman can win (maybe not in those exact words, but that’s how Warren took it) you would expect her to be shocked(!) that Bernie would say such a thing. So did she then just leave it at that and go off thinking Bernie is a dick? Or more likely, she would have immediately asked him for clarification...    
    
So then Bernie either verified that is indeed indeed think a woman can’t win (unlikely), or they discussed it until it she understood what he meant and was satisfied.

As much as I like Tulsi I would immediately stop supporting her if this ends up being a lie. She doesnâ€™t strike me as the kind of person to deceive Americans for her own personal gain. She stood up for what she believed (Iâ€™m referring to backing Sanders in 2016) knowing full well that it would have extremely negative consequences to her standing in the Democratic Party and her future electability. No banks are going to be giving her $400K to talk for an hour. She did that because she thought it was the right thing for the American people regardless of how it would negatively affect her. Sheâ€™s a better person than I am and a much much better person than Hillary."

Sheâ€™s only a Democrat in name. I agree with AOC that the Democratic Party is not a left party. They should actually want single-payer health care. They should have been supporting the protesters at Standing Rock. They should be for ending forever wars. They should be supportive of Bernie. They should be talking about issues instead of blaming everyone else for their faults. They shouldnâ€™t be casually smearing people they donâ€™t like as Russians. They should be treating people with respect, even ones they donâ€™t agree with. Tulsi is all these things that the Democratic Party is not.

I asked if I could have a canned soda. They said no, which I get. So I just said ok well can I get a free drink next time I come in? They said no, only on thursday. I was seriously flabbergasted. Really? You canâ€™t give me a free soda, that Iâ€™m entitled to, on a different day to make up for it? Then they said they donâ€™t have anyway to do that. They could have just wrote â€œfree sodaâ€ on a piece of paper and had the manager sign it. I was a little peeved at this point because it was so ridiculous. I said â€œso thereâ€™s no way I can get a free soda even though your huge sign right here says I get a free soda if I make a purchase on Thursdayâ€? And their answer was â€œYou can come back next Thursday and by something else.â€  Itâ€™s a fountain soda. It probably cost them $.10. So they want to piss off a customer over being so cheap they canâ€™t give me a free soda on a different day? I know itâ€™s stupid for me to get s bent out of shape about this, but the effort they went to to not please their customer was just amazing to me."

Letâ€™s also assume Liz was being truthful when she said that she and Bernie are good friends.     
    
Then, itâ€™s likely that if Warren heard Bernie say he didnâ€™t think a woman can win (maybe not in those exact words, but thatâ€™s how Warren took it) you would expect her to be shocked(!) that Bernie would say such a thing. So did she then just leave it at that and go off thinking Bernie is a dick? Or more likely, she would have immediately asked him for clarification...    
    
So then Bernie either verified that is indeed indeed think a woman canâ€™t win (unlikely), or they discussed it until it she understood what he meant and was satisfied.   
    
So either Bernie is lying now and was (and is) a dick, or Liz is lying and is purposefully misrepresenting Bernie and saved this private meeting in her back pocket to be used now for political gain.  Both of these seem preposterous to me."

tulsi,fecm8ca,t1_feckat5,1578977390.0,So once again the msm is spinning lies into clicks. Itâ€™s no wonder it lands when Trump calls it fake news.

WTF,febg2vi,t1_feamrsq,1578958457.0,Holy shit. Thatâ€™s where I live and I never knew. Maybe itâ€™s on another island because I havenâ€™t seen any here on Oahu.

If it looks correct (Iâ€™m not sure what the specs are, maybe it should be 5v, just a guess) then the motor is probably dead.

You donâ€™t want to get a shock accidentally."
WTF,feafh6v,t1_fe9za0i,1578948064.0,Cows are fully domesticated. If they left the farm they would become feral. We all know about feral cats. We have a lot of feral pigs where I live as well. I have never heard of a feral cow. I would what they would be like if that happened.

If it is then (while the platter is still removed) turn it on and check that the motor is spinning. If itâ€™s not then you are going to need some tech knowledge to diagnose why.
