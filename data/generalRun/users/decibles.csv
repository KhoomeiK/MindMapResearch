Same 24.2mp sensor as the 80D with a newer processor and a super compact frame. Just because it doesn’t have a magnesium frame and shoot at 1/8000 (which no one ever really freaking needs) doesn’t mean it’s a joke.

photography,fff171s,t1_fff0mb1,1579872860.0,"Photography is not a cheap hobby, but it’s also not 100% gear dependent if you’re just doing it for yourself and personal enjoyment. If a fast zoom is super far outside of your budget you can easily get a hold of something like the Canon 50mm f1.8 STM for under $100 used which will give your crop sensor camera an 85mm equivalent which is a decent focal length for local shows and DJ sets. You could also take a look at the Canon EF-S 24mm f2.8 which floats in the same price bracket but will give you a nice wide field of view in a super compact lens. 

With your Rebel you most likely got an 18-55 and\or a 55-250 which will be workable- you just may have to push your exposure and will end up with a little noise which you can embrace in your style or reduce with noise reduction in post processing. 

Take your time learning the limits of your gear, keep an eye out for used lenses with fast aperture and don’t let the pricing discourage you. My first body was a K-Mart clearance Nikon and it served me well for years with just the kit lens."

photography,ffd55ip,t1_ffcx0ay,1579813620.0,"Out of curiosity, why do you view the Optical Viewfinder as an advantage? The majority of upmarket mirrorless cameras (Read: Not the M-Series) have electronic viewfinders that give you accurate view of your exposure to speed shot acquisition and reduce chimping but maintain the stability of traditional camera ergonomics. 

As for the target audience of mirrorless...Mirrorless is the next evolution of interchangeable lens cameras, even Canon has stated that their roadmap is RF-Mount focused moving forward. 

You may be wondering who is the target audience of the M-Series camera and other EVF\OVF-less cameras, and that answer is people who want a powerful, compact imaging solution- often the top end of general consumers or as a second camera for more serious shooters."
photography,ffd3rzm,t1_ffd1sq4,1579812854.0,"I’d say the only thing you’d really miss is autofocus.

I suppose with the depth of field that is inherent with such a wide lens you could prop stop it down to F4.0 or F5.6 and still have a relatively sharp image focused to infinity. 

If you’re on Canon, my favorite street lenses have been the recent pancakes; the EF-S 24mm F2.8 & EF 40mm F2.8. Cheap as dirt, sharp as nails and you get autofocus. Can be had used for under $100.

There are a bunch of reputable websites that will rent you a body with lens and batteries for less than half of what you’re looking to spend and you could get yourself a seriously high end piece of kit to play with for the Vacation to REALLY treat yourself. 

I just recently took a trip to NYC and didn’t want to bring my EOS RP or 5DII so I rented a Fuji X-T3 w/ a 16-55 2.8, 23 f2 & 2 batteries for around $150 USD and had a BLAST. Even used the downtime to send all of my Canon kit in for cleaning and came back to a fresh kit.

photography,ff9qxi1,t1_ff9k0qv,1579719068.0,"With these kinds of things the reason you pay what you pay is for:

- color accuracy of the lighting\LEDs, most cheap LEDs will advertise 5600k but rarely is that consistent across the panel\multiple units. 

- Life of the board\unit; heat kills LEDS and these cheaper units often are only passively cooled creating a high failure rate over time

- Complete lack of features like Bluetooth or even proper brightness or color temperature control

To give you my anecdotal throwaway two cents- if you are working on a budget and are shooting what you’re shooting you would be better served saving a little more money and picking up something like the Godox AD200. Kits sell on Amazon with a plethora of attachments for as little as $225 USD and while yes, it is only one light... it will serve you faithfully for years, can slot into the larger Godox ecosystem in the event you continue to want to grow your kit, has serviceable parts in the event of failure and a BROAD community that can support you in the event you’re looking to achieve a particular effect.
