inthenews,ff7ke5j,t1_ff7j1lv,1579651627.0,Bro what you're saying isn't accurate bro. That's why impeachment exists.
inthenews,ff7i345,t1_ff7fpl3,1579650060.0,You're talking about the Republican witnesses who have refused to cooperate from the beginning. What you're saying is they should have been arrested for contempt.
inthenews,ff74cpi,t1_ff71blj,1579640868.0,"I personally find your argument to be very weak, and one I have not even heard proposed. Considering it does not seem to be a common assessment of what happened (and what happened **is** irrefutable, regardless of interpretation of legality) an impeachment trial to correctly present the facts is absolutely warranted. 

If only Republicans would even allow witnesses to be called."

Impeachment is *we don't let this shit slide when we have irrefutable proof it happened* whether or not the president's party will obstruct the trial."

changemyview,ff6q759,t1_ff6dyyn,1579632586.0,"I believe there's sort of a signal-feedback loop amongst individuals that everyone uses to determine if they're acting within ""safe"" boundaries of expression, as determined by peoples' reactions. This would explain why European men are more generally comfortable with their sexualities and American men have been pretty rigid, because there is fairly conservative and continuous cultural feedback that punishes straying from existing norms. There's some fluidity there, but there's also fear-based conservativism (not to put a judgment on it or anything.)

Objectively to determine whether a particular behavior fits within ""masculinity"" or ""femininity"" though? We can only reference what we learned from others in our lives. If no one else is present, that means remembering and feeling. Feelings probably come from two sources, learned responses and intuition. I think learned sense of gender is far stronger for most people, adjusted somewhat in each person by inherent/intuitional behavior, i.e. the conventional wisdom that babies are born already having a personality. But how we translate feelings into expression is a process mediated by our environment. A person that grew up like the kid in the jungle book would probably not act gendered in any recognizable way, whether male or female. But society has taken all *social* behavior and defined most of it on a gender binary.

I think that gets to what you're pointing at-- there's no actual masculine or feminine. Perhaps hormones and bodily circumstances laid out a very basic differentiation of behaviors, like more men were aggressive and women had restrictions on movement and greater caregiving tendencies due to pregnancy, and we built greater and greater notions of gender off of that as societies evolved. But besides that, it's true, gender barely exists except as learned behaviors and feedback loops. But for many people that's an uncomfortable Pandora's box, thus much of the ire towards Trans people. They'd rather it not be opened, because their beliefs of the world are fragile and very vulnerable to interrogation."

changemyview,ff4jvzc,t1_ff4buvv,1579565383.0,"Gender is a set of behaviors. That is what is meant by masculinity and femininity. Those 2 words refer to a massive set of behaviors that apply in one way or another to nearly every way a person expresses themself. When you look into that, you understand why there are not simply two ways a person can act.

Once you ask yourself why someone acts the way they do-- and why you act the way you do-- you understand it is because you act both how feels natural, how you have been taught, how society expects you to behave and the punishments and rewards for those behaviors. For many, their behavior (and reasons for acting those ways) simply don't fall neatly into ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" categories.

If they want to use new terms to make room for them, it's partially because the existing punishments for not falling into binary behavioral groups (""masculine"" or ""feminine"" gender expressions with limited cross-over, lest others feel uncomfortable) can be incredibly fucked up, including physical violence and total ostracization."
inthenews,ff4b58f,t1_ff4ax1n,1579559511.0,"Trump raised taxes on 95% of Americans and lowered it on corporations and the rich, creating an enormous deficit. Obama expanded and improved healthcare for most Americans. 

I consider these their respective most consequential acts."
inthenews,ff4ab7p,t1_ff49ybw,1579558983.0,"And every U.S. politician helps run the U.S. government, but some keep it running and some run it into the ground. Some use it mainly to help the most Americans possible, some use it mostly to help themselves and their family and friends. I don't see your point."
changemyview,ff49yy1,t1_ff47cmy,1579558767.0,"Because you would have to then look up the definitions of masculine and feminine, and then because those are just words referring to gender expression expected and associated with male- and female-sexed people and differ sometimes *in every way* and other times have similarities amongst each country and culture that has ever existed, you would then have to determine what is referred to broadly by the concepts of gender, gender expression, and gender identity in the first place. Just because people don't deeply reflect on the meanings of words every time they use them doesn't mean a multi-leveled construction of meaning isn't there. Gender can't be neatly summed up in a one sentence definition without further context. The context can be explained by any anthropologist. It involves seeing outside the narrow scope that you use to summarize reality to help you make it through your day. The narrow scope is a shortcut and can be useful but isn't an accurate depiction of reality."

addiction,ff1pnwo,t1_ff0r4pj,1579483394.0,I would put meth in that heroin category if I were you.
addiction,ff1p8s2,t1_ff0ysgs,1579483124.0,Lots of people don't feel much with heroin and morphine. Shooting up may be a different story. Know plenty of people who are addicted to pills but sniff heroin and don't like it/don't get high.
addiction,ff1otut,t1_feyzxcn,1579482868.0,The only reason we see less serious cocaine addiction today compared to other hard drugs is because it is incredibly expensive and usually heavily cut/diluted. You are not stupid for being addicted to it! In a way you are lucky it has become less accessible because back in the day cocaine addiction was pretty common. Also everyone is different and will be more susceptible to one addiction over another.
askseddit,fewx22h,t3_eqpgvf,1579420811.0,"All the comments already posted are interesting but I have to disagree with their premise that you should cope with this by doubling down on trying to get her.

No. Just no. You recognize something in her that you want. Those qualities do not only live in her. They also live in the girl that you will find who is attracted to you back. Those qualities are yours to hold onto and you are right to see that most other girls don't have them. Now you know what you want. Go find them."
