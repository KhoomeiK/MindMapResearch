In that case he'd have pretty much the entire Council on his side which would fundamentally change his chances. Even being able to call in just the Blackstaff would be a game-winning swing.

I think without the Council (or other allies such as a Fae using time dilation magic) or the ability to use black/gray magic I think he'd probably lose.
While magic can operate at the speed of thought, going against that level of superspeed and strength combined is near impossible to counter.

The only 2 possibilities that come to mind is if he could create a sympathetic link somehow (hair?) and then take him down that way or perhaps he could use his contacts to get his hands on a bunch of kryptonite  (perhaps Toot and co could be bribed with their own all you can eat pizza buffet in exchange for all the green rocks they can find) and then set himself up inside a couple of protective circles imbued with kryptonite and work out something from there."
KotakuInAction,fedezxd,t1_febzj5c,1579009705.0,The counter argument is that his idiotic regime founded on pushing the sjw narrative at every opportunity and use a female lead to do it only got into power by claiming (though there's a strong case it was only cherry picked and astroturfed evidence) that there was mass audience support for it so they must do it. Now that there is legitimate groundswell audience support against them suddenly their voice doesnt count and 'listening to the people' is wrong and they must stfu as their social and moral superiors preach to them from their pulpit.

dresdenfiles,feai7ul,t1_feaglnh,1578949074.0,"By tanky Denarians ill take that to be Ursiel and Magog. I think that would both be easily coutered by the Genoska and Naag because they dont seem to have the best magical resistances.

However (and Ill admit im biased towards the Loup) I think the Loup would give them both a hard time if it was a cage match (ie no escape) because its so hardcore offensive and it's unlikely either of them would have the right sort of familial ties (or friend network) to possess inherited silver. Though i think if it wasnt a cage match they are both cunning and cagey enough to flee and regroup and on the second attack would go for the vessel rather than the Loup directly.

The most fascinating possible interaction would be the Loup Garou vs a Denarian because a Denarian is the *literal embodiment* of inherited silver. Would be fascinating if they'd easily counter, or if they'd have to directly risk/use their coin or if they operated on such a different moral frequency that it wouldnt count."

It was stated that the Loup Garou bloodline was cursed 'until the end of days' so the obvious candidate is that she got a bun in her oven.

Would be some room to bring it into plotlines; since theyve gone heavily into Norse mythology it'd be interesting if it turned out that the Loup Garou and the curse was actually the Dresdenverse take on Fenrir and so kept being 'reborn' til he fulfilled his purpose at Ragnarok/BAT."
