But I've looked at the other cards you posted and you just have a super unique style. It's amazing"
cardmaking,ffls8yw,t3_eto7hk,1580043445.0,I love the way you put your cards together! The layering is on point and I like the little touch of vintage
kandi,ffc2tmb,t3_es2jao,1579790139.0,Its gorgeous

kandi,fdqyg6x,t3_emgi76,1578676757.0,"Not to be creepy but i really want to see how it looks when someone wears it.. I've seen a lot of cool stuff but only on mannequins. I want to make ""kandi clothing"" as well, but I can't imagine it to look good on me"

bulletjournal,fcyybx7,t1_fcyxcnz,1578089782.0,"The paper is from a local store called Action, a lot of my washi is from a lot of different local craft stores, sample swaps, or ali express (I'm kinda ashamed that I buy there tho. It's not environmentally nor creator friendly and I should stop it)
Yea and that's about it, I've been collecting art supplies for a realllly long time now so there is quite a lot laying around here.. 
Try to keep it simple, upcycle old magazines, use old paints/washis/stickers up if they still look good to you...
 I did this when I haven't had so much stuff and I think it was easier back then, now I've lost the overview"
bulletjournal,fcwvhol,t1_fcvpqne,1578039331.0,"That's the reason I started the ""normal"" bullet journal from the front and the back. In the back I had all my weird lists and ideas and in the front just my monthlies and weeklies.. and maybe a tracker but I've never used them xD

This planner is definitely way more practical when you want everything to be in order. And also if one page is super ugly you can throw it out ;)"
bulletjournal,fcvi3p3,t1_fcvgy7j,1578002557.0,"Thank you so much for your kind words!

I find it so hard to actually do something useful and I feel like I will never change. Someone told me it could take years to change ... so I'm just practicing kindness and patience to maybe get out of the endless spiral of depression. 

Sadly everyone sometimes feels like this and I want them all to know about mindfulness and kindness for themselves so life gets a bit easier. 
Aaaah is this too much? I'm sorry xD"
bulletjournal,fcv8u8i,t3_ej359t,1577997049.0,I love it!
bulletjournal,fcv1vyh,t1_fcv1l89,1577992920.0,"Ugh I feel that xD 

But that's the good thing about bullet journaling, you can just skip some weeks or just keep it simple if you don't have enough time"
bulletjournal,fcupwsk,t1_fcupglg,1577986127.0,"Then you really shouldn't worry bout your skill level... actually... never worry about that! 

When I look at the art journals I did in 2015 its amazing to see how much better I got over the years. 

Its gonna be the same with your art if you want to keep it up :D"
bulletjournal,fcuohy3,t1_fcuo87v,1577985334.0,"With a bit of practice I'm sure you can do neat collages as well, I'm making stuff like this for a few years now"
bulletjournal,fcumw74,t3_eiok7c,1577984420.0,Ohh I'd love to see more of your stuff!
