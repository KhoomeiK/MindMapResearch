selfimprovement,ffvx9ry,t1_ffvufmu,1580276098.0,"Also, sorry about your therapist. I know how it feels to lose one, especially at that point where you really start to get comfortable."
selfimprovement,ffvw24h,t1_ffvufmu,1580274991.0," It's the fact that I put so much weight on them really. I know that they happened, and I should be able to just move on and look towards the future, but even if I know that it's hard for me to not go back to the mindstate of ""x to me and so I act like this now because of x"" when in stressful situations. 

I also know the specific situations that caused my PTSD have had lasting effects in more specific senses, i.e my mother telling me she loves me and taking care of me sometimes, but other times being on drugs or depressed and neglecting me has caused bad trust issues. The abuse I experienced from my sister causing my anger and violence.  My dad being in prison then dying a year after he got out causing my emotional detachment from people. I don't really get sad when I think of these things, just dissociated or angry. This is what I mean when I say my experiences are holding me back. Yes I can meditate and journal and exercise to make myself feel pretty good and alleviate any depression, but I still dissociate, am easy to anger, have trust issues and anxiety, etc. Although I do think doing the things I talked about will help to sort of ""fix"" some of these, like the meditating helping with my anger, certain things like the dissociation or trust issues I doubt will fully go away until the original trauma is dealt with. 

What I mean by ""assessing and reevaluating"" is that, like you said, you grew up in a narcissistic home. Did you go through a process sort of like identifying a root cause to something (i.e anxiety being caused by certain events in childhood), then understanding why it happened, how it happened, and why you place weight into it, etc.? In order to fully ""reevaluate"" your viewpoint of what happened into a more hopeful one rather than one of regret/depression."
selfimprovement,ffsm4me,t1_ffqbx5r,1580185169.0," That's understandable. The thing is, that's the point of the future - you don't know what it holds. You're not supposed to be 'able' to see something positive or negative in the future, and you're not supposed to know how your life will turn out. You're simply supposed to deal with the absurdity in a way that provides the best possible outcome to yourself and your happiness, and eventually you will be happy through this.

 For example, look 10 years down the line. You could be a successful businessman, an engineer, or a millionaire. You could also be a heroin addict, homeless, or in prison. Or, you could be something in between; someone with a regular 9-5, maybe a family, etc. You don't know which of these you're going to be, but I can tell you one thing for a fact - If you act in a way that pushes you more towards success, even accounting for luck, you're much more likely to be successful. On the contrary, if you act in a way that pushes you more towards depression and self-loathing, you're much more likely to be so.

 Yes, it's possible for something insane to happen, making all of the work for naught. You could die, get robbed, framed for a murder, all sorts of things. Despite this, there's absolutely no reason to worry about it. It simply forces you to worry about the future and takes away from being grounded in the moment. What if those things do happen? They might. But what if instead, they don't? Then all of your worrying was worthless and a waste of time.
 
 So first, ground yourself in the moment. Try your best to stop worrying about what the future holds - what matters right now is the present. Then, throughout the day, try to be mindful of how you're feeling. Notice when you're depressed, and what you're doing when you're depressed. Also notice when you're happy (or just less depressed) and what you're doing when this occurs. Then, when you have the energy, start doing the things that alleviate the depression more. You won't always be able to, but the point is that eventually you will be able to, and the more you're able to the easier it gets - and the easier it gets, the less depressed you are generally.
 Again, I know that probably sounds like it won't work, or that you'll always be depressed, or that it's impossible to be mindful of these emotions. Like I said, it took me years to finally be able to recognize and redirect my feelings like this. I believe you can do it though."

selfimprovement,ffo3y0r,t1_ffnw61t,1580073871.0," What *is* the point? This is why I recommended reading into philosophy. Aristotelian philosophy deals with the true meaning of happiness a lot, existentialism deals with the ""meaning"" of self and the purpose in life, and Stoicism with the control of your own mind, actions, and perception.

 Of course reading, and even just getting out of bed can be very difficult with depression and so that's up to you. There are always reasons to not try, and there are always reasons to try. First off, learn to understand that there genuinely, truly are better days ahead. Whether or not you choose to reach out and grab them is up to you. It is cliche to say, and something I struggled with for a long time - and many times it will sound like complete bullshit. Even after I started genuinely working on myself, I still believed it was a lie that normal people just told people like you and me to stroke their ego and feel like they're helping when in reality it's just virtue signaling. Honestly, in their case it usually is, but coming from someone who's been through similar things, it's genuine. I've encountered these failures you talk about. I've relapsed, I've been kicked out of school, rejected, lost friends, etc. But, eventually, there was a day where all of that sort of stopped mattering to me. It took a long time, but I realized that I have no power to change those things, and the only thing I can do is improve my future and try to make it better - and it has gotten better, finally.

 What you should start doing is tracking your days. In fact you don't even have to track them, just notice how you're feeling throughout the day. Notice what actions makes you depressed and anxious, and try to avoid it. Notice also what actions make you happy or excited or confident, and try to move towards it. Sometimes you'll fail, other times you'll succeed. But the more you succeed in working towards it, the better you'll get at it. Eventually one day you'll find that you do these things that make you happy with ease and hardly exert any energy in doing them.

 I'm going to give you a list of things that I like to do (and don't like to do but do anyway because they're better in the long run). Maybe you'll enjoy some of them, maybe you won't. I'm only giving you my own list because I know it can be hard to identify anything that makes you happy when depressed, although I'm sure you do have some things of your own you like to do even if you don't realize it. Here it is: Reading, meditating, journaling, exercising, playing instruments, talking to family/friends, talking cold showers, developing new interests (i.e if you're really into something, dive into the rabbit hole and try to find out more about it), playing video games, listening to music, cleaning my room, playing with cards, yo-yo'ing, and playing with rubiks cubes.
 
Tell me what you think of all this and be honest. If you think something sounds like bullshit, or if you're interested in something I said let me know. I'll try to explain it more or give an alternative."
selfimprovement,ffnuhi5,t1_ffntex1,1580070995.0," I have C-PTSD, which - in my case - encompasses severe depression, sever social and general anxiety, impulse control disorder, and DP/DR. I understand a lot more than you think. You're simply contriving a warped world view to cater to your already set-in-stone beliefs."
selfimprovement,ffnrnwi,t1_ffnp73r,1580069852.0," It's obvious you're just trying to get sympathy for your set in stone, blatantly false world view. I wouldn't be surprised if even you yourself don't really believe what you're saying."
selfimprovement,ffno3cr,t3_eu2489,1580068403.0," Luck doesn't have anything to do with your success, the sooner you realize this the better. And even if it did, what does it matter? The lazy, hedonistic, lucky person will accomplish much less and not be nearly as happy as the determined, moderate, unlucky person. 

 You're seeing things from a pre-determinism, nihilistic perspective. I also wouldn't doubt that these ""failures"" you're always experiencing are exaggerated greatly by your depression. You should try to change your mind state to one of persistence, in which these failures are merely set backs, and are taken in stride. I would look into philosophy too, specifically the Existentialism, Aristotelian, and Stoicism schools of thought."
selfimprovement,ffnkqsd,t3_eu2qd5,1580067298.0," Regarding your questions in management and leading a team, read the book ""How to Win Friends and Influence People."" This situation is talked about in just the first few chapters of the book extensively. You don't want to be an asshole when leading a group, you want to ignite in them a yearning to work harder and do better which is what the first 3 chapters talk about. I could just tell you the principles he lays out, but you won't understand them fully unless you actually read the book. 

 Regarding the second problem, talent has nothing to do with your acceptance in society. I don't want to seem like I'm bragging, but I'm a naturally talented person and can play multiple instruments, do magic, play a few sports very well, and generally pick things up very quick. Despite this, I was never ""accepted"" into society until I learned how to communicate with people. All the cheap tricks in the world won't help you gain friends, admiration, or good workers. Once you realize and accept that people only care about themselves and what they want, and learn how to cater to that, you will be much more successful (another point talked about in the book mentioned). I also recommend vipasanna meditation to help with managing and understanding your emotions, i.e being upset.

 Could you elaborate more on your ""ethical dilemmas""? I think I have a bit of an idea of how to help remedy them but I would need to know a little more detail."
selfimprovement,ffng4pq,t3_eu4s1l,1580065472.0," I would really consider 2 cans a day detrimental, I used to drink up to a 2 liter of Pepsi a day (still do sometimes). When I was boxing though I had to stop, soda and fast food would make me throw up when I exercised. Maybe try getting into something like that, i.e an intensive sport/running or anything really physically intensive that you enjoy. It will give you more drive to quit. Also try replacing it with something else that's a little more healthy, like hot tea, black coffee, or water."

As if your brain is sort of being squeezed? If so I get the same thing when focusing too hard. I'm not sure if it'll help, but I'd recommend mindfulness meditation to train your focus along with taking breaks when you start to feel it happening; studying without taking breaks isn't optimal either way."

I have C-PTSD (never formally diagnosed since it's not in the DSM-5, but has been corroborated by 2 therapists and a psychiatrist) and I'm finally ready to actually fix it. I've been meditating, reading, journaling, exercising etc. but I still feel like my traumatic experiences are holding me back a lot. I want to start EMDR therapy (recommended by my old therapist) and got a good deal on it so it would only be $150 a session, but that's still a lot of money and I don't even know if I could go for more than 3-4 sessions. How exactly did you go about assessing and reevaluating all of this?"
wowthanksimcured,ffk8erw,t1_ff75tkj,1580018654.0," Coming from someone who grew up very poor in a family full of alcoholism, abuse, mental illness and drug addiction, surrounded by friends of many ethnicities who also grew up in similar conditions, there are almost no barriers at all to the attainment of success; and the ones that do exist aren't strong enough to keep you poor.

coldshowers,fffssyg,t3_esdh8b,1579891024.0," Just last month or so I quit smoking, started taking cold showers every morning, meditating, journaling, exercising, reading and 14 days ago I started doing nofap/noporn (was very addicted for years, finally broke it).

 Some tips, I really recommend keeping a journal. I usually write 2-4 pages a night, but even 1 page is good. Record what you did throughout the day, if you stuck to your schedule (if you didn't, explain why, and if you don't have a good enough explanation or can tell you're bullshitting and making excuses, note it and do it tomorrow), what you felt and did all day, why you reacted in certain ways to certain things, how you can improve, etc.

 Regarding the meditation, I would recommend starting out with 10 or 15 minutes a day, then each week upping it by 5 minutes. My schedule right now is 25 minutes a day, Saturdays I do untimed meditation, and Sunday I up the time by 5 minutes for the week. I also saw you talking in another comment about guided meditations and breathing exercises. Guided meditations are fine starting out, but I recommend trying to do it by yourself, and instead of doing breathing exercises, try to just focus on your natural breaths without changing it, look into vipassana meditation. If you choose to stick with even one thing out of this entire list and end up dropping everything else, I would honestly recommend the meditation ; It genuinely has changed my entire outlook on things.

 Nofap is good, but only if you're also not looking at porn. Porn is what really screws with your brain/confidence."
coldshowers,fffprax,t1_ffeh8s6,1579889142.0," Thanks, this actually helped a lot. I tried it out this morning, took a cold shower like usual, switched to warm/lukewarm to wash out the conditioner, then went back to cold for 30 seconds to just make sure I don't get too used to the warm water."
coldshowers,fffpnxj,t1_fferz32,1579889082.0," I don't know if I can do that, like another comment mentioned, I have bad anxiety and a sort of dysmorphic perception of my cleanliness, I don't think I'd be able to get through the day normally if I didn't wash my entire body with soap"
coldshowers,fffaspl,t1_ffez0ut,1579879854.0," My friend told me that he does the same thing, apparently you're not supposed to really ""squeegy"" out the hair, just wash it until the conditioner stops running out and dry it. Also, you hit the nail on the head with the perceived cleanliness thing; I wish I could wash my hair only once or twice a week, considering it's healthier and easier, but I still feel dirty afterwards if I don't. It's the same reason as to why I hate skipping body parts like my back while showering."
coldshowers,fffadhh,t1_ffezg90,1579879588.0," I'm in Pennsylvania, around this time it's generally 40~ degrees or so Fahrenheit. Also just tried this earlier, I took a cold shower to shampoo and wash the body, then I turned it to lukewarm so I could wash the conditioner out, then finally back to cold for about 40 seconds just to make sure I'm woken up. I definitely was a bit colder after I first got out, but wasn't shivering the whole time afterwards like usual."
coldshowers,ffeh508,t1_ffegyj3,1579847802.0," I used to be the same way, I recommend getting a loofah if you don't already use one. It cut my shower times down from about 25-30 minutes to only 15-20. Do you also get shivers/generally get really cold after getting out of the cold shower while in for so long?"
coldshowers,ffeh2e3,t1_ffegos3,1579847721.0," It's not the cold water that gets to me, it's mainly the fact that the cold water seems to make it harder/take longer to wash the conditioner out of my hair and so I'm in for a lot longer than people seem to recommend.

Meditation,ffb9z8z,t1_ffb3bkx,1579756767.0," Well, what seems unexciting/boring/negative about DXM to you is what appealed to me. I loved not being able to walk or stand, it was like free entertainment to me - I would just try to walk, and I couldn't. Feeling dissociated to me was like a safe haven, I have PTSD from childhood traumas and being able to just escape and be completely out of this world and just happy was amazing to me. Another big part was that it made me feel extremely empathetic, empathy being something I struggle with a lot. I've never had a bad trip on DXM. Even throwing up was enjoyable to me, because I was throwing up but I couldn't really 'comprehend' what was going on while it was happening.  

On the third plateau it felt like I could ""see"" my whole life, past present and future, and was just completely content with all the choices I had made and would make. On the fourth plateau, I felt like a genius who's head was split in half and all the knowledge of the universe was pouring in, like I was on the verge of some huge discovery that would change the way we understand everything. I loved the feeling of being dissociated, but I don't think my DXM trips were very much like a lot of other people's either. I never got any hallucinations of any kind, not even tracers no matter how hard I tried. I also never felt any anxiety, even on the come up I rarely felt any."
Meditation,ff9onn6,t3_eseb73,1579717417.0,"Dissociation is a bitch, I recommend trying to do body scans if they help with it (they do for me, do 25 minute meditations or untimed meditations and always start with a body scan). Also look into self fulfilling prophecies (if you think you're dissociated or think you will dissociate, then you're going to) and, if you have the money, look into EDMR therapy. Finally, you'll probably need to quit doing all drugs if you really want your dissociation to get better. Mine was horrible for months, and it only ended up starting improving once I stopped smoking. It was originally triggered by DXM abuse but it had always sort of been there, just not as noticeable. The only thing I still do that doesn't seem to affect it much is drinking.

Meditation,fdrw9nx,t1_fdptnpi,1578690719.0," What is a body scan, like focusing on each separate part of the body at a time? I've been getting a lot better at meditating and I like doing it, I just don't really know what it feels like to be ""mindful"" and so it's sort of hard for me to be able to tell if I'm actually being focused in meditation or just dissociating.

Meditation,fdpqvdh,t1_fdpq85v,1578637062.0," That's a good idea, thanks. I've been mainly focusing solely on my breathing so far, but if I were to just take a little bit to actually focus on something like the temperature it would help ground me.

It doesn't ""reset"" my cravings at all to smoke them and I don't really crave them instead (as long as I don't inhale I assume), but it does give me the satisfaction of being able to `smoke` something. Is that a bad way to deal with it, or is it okay to sort of keep that as a fallback for strong cravings until I'm confident I won't have any more problems with cigs?
 Looking into some of those links, although I don't like trying to diagnose myself with anything, I do resonate a lot with the complex PTSD. I was abused physically/mentally and neglected a lot as a child, my mom was bipolar and my dad was in prison and died soon after he got out. My older sister was slow and we would have knife and fist fights constantly.
