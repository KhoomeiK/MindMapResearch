I can't spin this in a way where it's responsible to be having a partner of a month meet your kids who've recently been traumatized from a divorce. This is sad. This makes me feel bad for your kids.

It's impossible to judge this in a vacuum. What kind of hours do you work, what kind of hours does she work, what is she doing with the kids, what are you doing with the kids, what are you doing in your free time out of the house, how much of that time are you getting. 

From what you've written it doesn't sound like you are or care to do much with the kids."

I'm a resident doctor and work terrible hours and have less time with my kids than I want. We went to a practice run for our derby car and my son was in last place. It was obvious everyone else had their car made by their dads. Handy dads and I'm not that handy. It was an eye opening experience. It was a lesson on being a good loser, being a good sport. But it's also just shitty, there's no way a seven year old can compete with grown ass men, it doesn't feel fair, and being a good loser in a rigged game feels like a shitty lesson to teach. 

Anyway, he (I) were average last night, but won for his age group. He got to design his car how he wanted, it very much looked and was a car made by a kid, but I taped weights to the top and bent/polished the axles and made it a rail rider. Felt like a fair compromise. It was still by far the only one that looked like a kid was involved."

Under the auspices of being best friends OP is okay with his friend being very physical and affectionate with him. Later it turns out he's been in love with him. OP never got to make the choice about accepting hugs and back rubs from someone who was in love with him, feelings he doesn't reciprocate. I wouldn't be comfortable, male or female, OP may feel the same way. 

It's also creepy when guys have women as ""really good friends"" and as the friend without any romantic anything leverage that moniker to be super affectionate and physical. It's not weird, we're just friends. And then later say the whole time they've been in love. And get mad when everyone calls them creepy. The way we interact with people is predicated on the basis of our relationships whether family, friends, etc. Whatever physical interactions we're okay with, we consent to, are mediated on what kind of relationship we think that is."
