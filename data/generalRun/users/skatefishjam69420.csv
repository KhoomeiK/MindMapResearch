AskReddit,fguycng,t1_fguw0qr,1581132229.0,"It's not worth arguing with this guy.  The proof of what you are talking about is right here the post.  White guy comments that the most racist thing that's ever happened to him was someone said that red velvet cake is a black person food.  Meanwhile another comment mentions a bunch of people using racial slurs in a bar and suggesting that somebody be lynched.

So yes, the guy whose comment says that he's gotten ""well you are white, so...""(and that's the most racist thing that's ever happened to him) clearly is white, so he hasn't really experienced the same racism others have experienced.

And likely, he didn't read any other comments on the post, just came to explain how terribly he was victimized, instead of learning about the perspective of others (which has been a significantly worse experience than his).

Not to downplay being judged based on your race, which may vaguely be what he was talking about.  Being white, I understand some of the frustrations that go along with the narrative that racism can't be directed at white people.  I think that some are unwilling to see it from the others perspective, and literally only having your own life experience it's sort of hard to see it from another perspective.  Combine that with how common and acceptable racism has been in the relatively recent past, it's only more complicated.

Edit: actually, the more I look at your properties, the more things I see that are wrong.  not only should all 3 G(shear modulus) values not be the same number, but for your 90 degree properties you have incorrectly transformed your 0 degree properties.

For example, your E3 value is absolutely wrong in the 90 degree ply, and I'd wager that your poissons ratios might be incorrect as well.

tip: use the same properties for both the 0 and 90 degree plies, BUT assign them different material orientations.

When I get to my desk later I will tell you how to calculate G23 for the 0 degree ply

edit2: for G23 use (E2/2)/(1+v23) big note: idk if this will work on your transformed properties, and it's way too much of a headache for me to try to tell you how to properly transform from a 0 degree ply to a 90 degree ply.  use the same material properties and assign different material orientations in ABAQUS!"

On a side note: rent textbooks from amazon, buy the international edition or an old edition if possible, or try to find a PDF of the book online.  I'm in grad school now, and this semester I found both of my books for free as PDFs.  Also, for many classes during undergrad I got away with never buying the book.

Also, if you're able to find your books as PDFs, as the another comment mentioned about e-textbooks, if you use CTRL+F you can quickly search the book for any word.  Much faster than looking in the index and flipping pages.

Fishing,fg4i4yh,t3_ewu8p9,1580503718.0,"First, you should learn to tie a uni knot.  Get some line and watch them tie it on youtube.  Learn to tie it yourself.  Then tie it like 20-30 times or something, so that when you're fishing later if you have to tie it you'll know how without having to look it up.  Maybe also learn the palomar knot, as it's a pretty easy one.

Then, go practice your casting with a topwater lure.  Topwater lures reduce the risk of getting snagged, so you can really just practice your casting until you have it down.  You might even catch a fish, but really just use it as an exercise to practice casting accuracy.

Once you can tie a knot and cast well, you're pretty much good to go, from there, research the techniques for catching various fish online(or ask other fishermen or staff at local tackle shops), and then go out and do it.

Know that it's common to lose gear, it's common to get your line tangled.  As you learn, the frequency of these two things happening will decrease, and you'll learn to untangle stuff more quickly.

I recommend getting a $15-20 rod at walmart (7', medium-medium heavy), a topwater lure, and some small hooks and bobbers.  Just use worms for bait at first.

Fishing,ffmx4vn,t3_eu4w9z,1580059801.0,"What he probably meant is that the rod you were looking at is designed for bass fishing.

I have a baitcaster that's designed for bass fishing, and I've used it for carp many times.  You can technically do what you want, as long as you don't overload your rod, and you set your tension/mag right so that you don't backlash.  That being said, if you're using it for something it's not intended for, don't be surprised if some of the internals of the reel wear out faster than you'd expect.

I think maybe he was trying to help you find something really suited for your needs, for example if you're going to be bottom fishing with a sinker you might want a different combo than you would use for bass fishing with lures.

Also, if you want to learn to use a baitcaster, I suggest you get one made for casting lures, and use it to cast lures.  More casts, more learning, and the big ones for casting sinkers (I have one I throw 10oz with) are not too easy, there's a ton more line to make problems for you if something goes wrong.  Hence it might be better to learn on one where you're constantly casting and retrieving lures."
Fishing,ffmv0g2,t3_eu9gi5,1580059259.0,"I would call that at least 15lb, which is probably low, at most 27lb, which might be high.

Not that exact one, but you get the idea.  You can probably get one at walmart for like $5 or less.  I have a few of these, and depending on what type of fishing I'm doing that day, I grab one or two of 'em and throw em in a backpack and I'm good to go.

I also have a surf bag, which is fully waterproof and has drain holes, and you just hang plugs in there.  It is pretty sweet for wading, but probably not cheap or necessary for most fishing."

Fishing,ffijcb6,t3_etnns3,1579975245.0,"Just make sure that you can get the palomar knot really tight, it can be harder to get properly tied with higher pound mono.

I use a uni knot for higher pound mono/fluoro that I can't get the palomar nice on.

For example, for tarpon fishing from shore I use 80lb fluoro leader tied to a clip with a uni.  So far I've hooked two monsters, one broke my mainline, cause it took the lure really close to the end of the jetty I was on and ran against the rocks.  The second my leader itself broke from rubbing up on the gill plate of the fish.  Neither time was the uni knot the issue.  Other guys I've done this fishing with use basically the same exact setup, I haven't seen the uni knot fail.

But that being said, I like to use the palomar when I can, it just doesn't tie right for some higher pound line.  Good luck!  Those umbrella rigs are pretty killer"

Mario odyssey was really good.  Untitled goose game was good, but short.  I put a fair amount of time into stardew valley.  I'm working on wargroove right now.  Doom was fun, and a new one will come out this year.

Fishing,ffh7yjo,t3_etlakq,1579925682.0,"I mostly fish saltwater and bluefish and spanish mackerel are real toothy bastards.  Last year I started using 50lb mono, and make the leader a bit long.  I inspect it every few fish and if it's getting nicked or anything I'll cut it and retie where it's strong.  I stopped losing lures once I started doing this.

So I tried for musky in a lake near my parents that stocks them, and I bought some 40lb fluoro.  Not a musky expert or anything, I forget if I did research, but it seemed sufficient, and this is what I'll be rigging my bluefish/spanish setup with this year.  When I'm not targeting the toothy ones I use 20lb fluoro, just cause ya never know, in saltwater what'll bite, and the 20lb seems to hold up to one toothy fish pretty well enough of the time.

Or if it works you could potentially fish it as is.  I have a bait caster that the tip broke off to the second guide and I caught my pb smallmouth (4-6lbs) with it like that.  Not ideal, but if it works it works, I just leave that one up at my folks place in case I was in a hurry and didn't pack any fishing gear and I want to fish when I visit."

Fishing,ffe5sk5,t3_esq1m3,1579837452.0,"It'll be OK for a little while, but it's not gonna hold up too long in a saltwater environment.  Lost several fish last year because I was using cheap gear and the drag just wasn't smooth enough.  I also caught plenty of fish too, so absolutely, this could be an OK setup for cheap, however, I would get something just a bit heavier, which could comfortably throw 1-2oz.

I'd say 90% of the time on the pier I like to throw anywhere from 1/4-1oz lures.  Or you want something that can throw 2-4oz for bottom fishing.

Of course there are other rods you can use on a pier for other methods of fishing.  However, just in general, I would say that this combo you're looking at is just a bit light.  It'll probably handle up to 1oz, so if you want to bottom fish with it, you should get something a bit heavier."
