edit: with today's rise in market capitalization, i think tesla could buy a controlling interest in ford. ford has a 36B market cap. 10% ownership is often enough for control; you don't need 51%. I haven't studied ford's specific situation, but 20% at least should do it, probably less.
that would let tesla raid ford for the stuff they want, without being stuck with all the liabilities of full ownership. gm is only about 2ce that size. 48B.

they could start buying shares, the news would tend to drive the price up, they could then sell some of the shares at the higher price, while making lowball offers for the companies based on their real estate holdings as sites for future GFs. even pretending to do this as a feint would generate lots of media buzz."
