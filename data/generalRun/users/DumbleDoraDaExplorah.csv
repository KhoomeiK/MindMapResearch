AskAnAmerican,fdkbljt,t1_fdk1u9a,1578500425.0,"> a higher percentage of Republicans voted for civil right than Democrats

This needs some historical context, because you're being misleading. [When we look](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/27/1377639659080/partycivilrights.jpeg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8a8bd8fd2950db2747f1843f40602ab5)  at the party vote in both houses of Congress, it fits what you said, Republicans are more in favor of the bill.

80%  of Republicans in the House and Senate voted for the bill. Less than 70% of Democrats did. Indeed, Minority Leader Republican Everett Dirksen  led the fight to end the filibuster. Meanwhile, Democrats such as  Richard Russell of Georgia and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina tried as  hard as they could to sustain a filibuster.

Of  course, it was also Democrats who helped usher the bill through  the  House, Senate, and ultimately a Democratic president who signed it  into  law. The bill wouldn't have passed without the support of Majority   Leader Mike Mansfield of Montana, a Democrat. Majority Whip Hubert  Humphrey,  who basically split the Democratic party in two with his 1948   Democratic National Convention speech calling for equal rights for  all,  kept tabs on individual members to ensure the bill had the numbers  to  overcome the filibuster.

Put  another way, party affiliation seems to be somewhat predictive,  but  something seems to be missing. So, what factor did best predicting  voting?

You don't need to know too  much history to understand that the South  from the civil war to the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 tended to be opposed  to minority rights. This  factor was separate from party identification or ideology. We can easily  control for this variable by breaking up the  voting by those states  that were part of the confederacy and those that  were not.   [You can see that geography](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/27/1377639785816/regioncivlrights.jpeg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9db6c0ac6a1da87028890d943feee9b6)   was far more predictive of voting coalitions on the Civil Rights than   party affiliation. In fact, 90% of members of Congress from  states (or  territories) that were part of the Union voted in favor of  the act,  while less than 10% of members of Congress from the old  Confederate  states voted for it. This 80pt difference between regions is  far  greater than the 15pt difference between parties.

But what happens when we control for both [party affilitation and region?](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/27/1377639850437/bothcivilrights.jpeg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2affbf28c3669eb7560ded4b42f262f2)   In this case, it becomes clear that Democrats in the north and the  south  were more likely to vote for the bill than Republicans in the  north and  south respectively. This difference in both houses is  statistically significant  with over 95% confidence. It just so happened  southerners made up a  larger percentage of the Democratic than  Republican caucus, which  created the initial impression than  Republicans were more in favor of  the act.

Nearly  100% of Union state Democrats supported the 1964 Civil Rights Act   compared to 85% of Republicans. None of the southern Republicans voted   for the bill, while a small percentage of southern Democrats did.

>  Republicans passed the 13th through the 15th amendment over Democrat opposition. 

Basically a reiteration of what I said about the Civil Rights Act. Also, Democrats were the conservative party at the time of these two amendments passing. There have been several party switches over time and Republicans are now the conservative party. So to answer your question, ""What do you have to lose by voting Republican?"" well, all they have to do is turn to history."
