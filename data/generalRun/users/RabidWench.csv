bulletjournal,fexo2nc,t3_eqlrxt,1579433836.0,"So I tried finding the jetpens article I'm sure I saw once upon a time, but I can't right now. Iirc the basic gist is that ballpoint pens are more waterproof because they're oil based inks, and thus less likely to smear under water based highlighters. 

[This article](https://allaboutplanners.com.au/pens-highlighters-smear-testing-which-ones-dont-smear/) has a pretty comprehensive list of good highlighters vs. pens, and seems to recommend ballpoint and Pilot Frixion as well as a few others. I can absolutely recommend the pilot frixion for color range and writability, but haven't done much highlighting over them."

I don't need this drama, but it sounds fun from a distance. 😂"
nursing,fe4ta69,t1_fe3n4e4,1578862595.0,"Here's the thing, when you're in school, it feels like you spend so much time in clinicals but you don't really. It's a few shifts a week, sometimes even just half shifts, for less than 2 years. And all of those shifts are spent under the supervision of a licensed RN. So you never get to learn who you are as a nurse, and you probably never get to experience the 'oh shit' moments, especially not alone. 

So while you do learn important things in school, it's not stuff that impacts how you function as a care giver."

But reading the rest of these, I feel lucky."
nursing,fe10ma2,t3_enjfew,1578821163.0,"I know I'm going to sound like a broken record here, but don't try to do this. Take the time to establish yourself in your practice. Learn how you prioritize care, manage time, manage charting. Learn yourself as a practicing nurse before jumping into the metaphorical deep end. Develop the confidence to speak to doctors and ancillary personnel professionally and confidently. 

All this is aside from the fact that no agency will even touch a new grad. It's a huge liability for them if their travel nurse can't perform. So consider what you're getting into if an agency is willing to take you; if they're that irresponsible, will they support you adequately when push comes to shove? Not likely. Every contract requires testing (especially if you have the slightest change of unit description,  like ICU/CVICU/stepdown/IMC, you will take a whole new test every time). Many of these tests have questions unlike the NCLEX, requiring real world experience to answer. 

Take the time (FWIW I advise 3-4 years but some will take you with 2), get your professional life together. Make sure you're up to date on all your shots and titers (my school only asked once, and my first job never asked me for booster records or anything). Make sure you get all your certs for free from your full time job before you leave, and all your medical check ups. Then fly free."

It only means that I saw them sign the paper, hence ""witness"".

Just for the sake of my own conscience, I do make sure they are alert and oriented enough to be able to understand what signing means, and I always ask if the doctor has explained the procedure to their satisfaction (and if they still have any questions about the procedure).

JUSTNOMIL,fc6qgje,t1_fc661le,1577486888.0,This is so weird. I stumbled upon the Obama video at the White House Correspondent's dinner last night and this comment today. Are you my FBI agent? 😂
bulletjournal,fc6pz2t,t1_fc65534,1577486546.0,"Hahaha, yes. So tedious but necessary. All handwriting is a matter of muscle memory."
bulletjournal,fc6pvih,t1_fc5wh4i,1577486475.0,"You're very welcome. I quite like her channel for learning, and I'm still a work in progress myself. 😁"
nursing,fc5ucad,t1_fc515oh,1577466073.0,"If you shift your thinking to consider it a job instead of a vocation for martyrs, it's pretty easy to ignore that. It's not like truck drivers or waiters question themselves when one of their coworkers is an idiot."
bulletjournal,fc5tq8a,t3_egalfw,1577465674.0,"I've mentioned this channel before, and I probably will again: Happily Ever Crafter on youtube. She has full tutorials and tips on how to learn and improve your calligraphy. She would tell you that you're writing in cursive, not calligraphy, which is what brush pens are for. So (paraphrasing her), you need to slow down, learn the strokes (because they make it so much easier when the letters are broken into steps), and practice a lot."
JUSTNOMIL,fc5spgl,t1_fc4k5q0,1577465010.0,"Unless she had quadruplets, I feel like a single kid is a pretty good test run for how you're going to do discipline. Having 4 with no real parenting in sight is a little horrifying. And I say this as a parent with a few surprise babies under my belt, including twins. My kids are on their best damn behavior when we visit other people's homes, or we leave. Period. 

Parenting requires compassion toward your kids, but also (equally importantly) toward the people around you."
