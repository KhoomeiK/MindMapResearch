Medium monsters: Alien, Predator, The Thing, A Quiet Place, The Fly, Pitch Black, Pans Labyrinth, the Descent

Smol Monsters: Gremlins

Special mention of District 9.  The Aliens are kind of victims and we are the monsters (like Avatar) but it has Aliens and war, based on Earth. Awesome movie."

I think if you just introduce the idea of entropy or a cascading event at the same time people get the idea that they can't go backwards."

ScientificArt,ffvey0v,t1_ffv67a6,1580262534.0,"I said I would update if Bertrand Russell said anything interesting so I will make a new post instead of an edit for OP to get a notification.  In 1923 the year this was written the 88th element hafnium was discovered.

Firstly Mendellson (1946) attributed the solar system like image of atoms to both Rutherford and Bohr but Russell says:

*Rutherford to whom, more than any other single man, is due the conception of the atom as a solar system of electrons revolving round a nucleus...*

He only brings Bohr in to the story later in relation to his theory concerning the rings of electrons. 

Secondly he says:

*An atom... consists, like the solar system, of a number of planets moving round a central body, the planets being called ""electrons"" and the central body ""nucleus."" But the planets are not attached as firmly to the central body as they are in the solar system. Sometimes, under outside influences, a planet flies off, and either becomes attached to some other system, or wanders about for a while as a free electron.*

He continues using the solar system model for a whole chapter, including different sets of orbits and velocities and in which ways they are similar and differ from planets.


Really lovely adorable text.  I think reading old science books may be my new hobby."
