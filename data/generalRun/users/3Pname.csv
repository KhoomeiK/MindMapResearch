pens,feiasi3,t3_ep8mdc,1579134150.0,"Big Idea Designs machines solid pens that have a mechanism to twist down onto the tip of the ink cartridge for absolutely no play. It can fit whatever refill your heart desires.

To ensure zero tip wiggle try capped pens. Pens with moving mechanisms like clicks and twists sometimes cause more tip wiggle. 

A tiny piece of tape right on the tip of the ink cartridge that touches the barrel opening will make it tight enough to not cause any wiggle."
