- https://www.urbanaxes.com/
- https://batlgrounds.com/"
AxeThrowing,fdqyz1j,t1_fdqw9pn,1578677074.0,"just hit the bullseye each time :D

actual advice:

- most important advice I can give starting out is to find a position for your feet that works for you and then make sure to put your feet in the EXACT same place every time. That way you have a consistent foundation (for instance, I throw with my left foot one inch behind the throw line). And from there once you get the hang of it you can use your foot position to adjust how you're landing. Like if you're under-rotating (the blade is landing flat or handle down) then move back a couple inches so your axe has time to rotate into the point. Or, conversely, if you're over-rotating (the axe is hitting on the top of the head, or handle backwards) then move a couple inches forward so the blade is hitting on the point before rotating into the head. 

- find an axe you like and stick to that axe until you've got it down (but figure out if you're gonna throw in a league, because you don't want to get used to an axe that isn't legal for your league... like that metal handle is a no-go for IATF, for example). Honestly I've thrown a bunch of axes and the [Cold Steel Axe Gang](https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Steel-Axe-Gang-Hatchet/dp/B004WDVNGG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2Z92QLNRR2540&dchild=1&keywords=cold+steel+axe+gang+hatchet&qid=1578676603&sprefix=Cold+Steel+Axe+Gang%2Caps%2C200&sr=8-1) (or cold steel competition thrower, they're basically the same thing) is your best bet - they're inexpensive which is good because starting out you're gonna be rough on your axe and beat it up pretty bad, and most importantly they have a VERY narrow blade profile which is a major advantage (a narrow blade sticks easier in layman terms). They come longer than legal, so you'll have to cut it down - the cool thing about being new is that you can cut it to basically any legal length and just learn that. I bought mine the day after my first time throwing and just randomly picked the length at 14.5"", and now that's what I throw. I've gotten to where I can throw any length, but starting out it's important that you learn YOUR axe.

- Don't get discouraged, getting good is about putting those reps in. There will be times where you'll go practice and be fucking on it, landing every throw, doing great... then the next day nothing sticks, and you're like ""what the fuck? I'm doing the exact same thing as yesterday!"", it's just a matter of reps and muscle memory. Get those reps in and your throw will figure itself out. 

- find a league! They're super fun, and it's a great way to get better - you can see what works for other people, see what you shoudl try, have other people spot you, etc"

deadbydaylight,fdi56n0,t3_eliw9j,1578435926.0,"I've really been dreading this one - first off, I'm not a big Stranger Things fan. I thought the first season was fantastic, it just didn't need a bunch of sequels of decreasing quality - but i digress - the *real* problem is [look at Demo's list of add ons](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/The_Demogorgon)... there's really not much for me to work with here. I try hard not to pull elements from the source material that AREN'T in DBD itself, but this time around I had to. Oh well. I think it came out alright. There's some nitpicky detail stuff I'm going to go back and clean up or fix but as of now, i just want this one done. 

I have updated my [redbubble store](https://www.redbubble.com/people/gopencyprep) with a lot of new stuff - there isn't a lot of DBD stuff on there right now (navigating the vagaries of copyright violations on redbubble is a bit hit or miss) but there are head stickers for [Hag](https://i.imgur.com/5DIzVYB.png), [Huntress](https://i.imgur.com/tUfIH1i.png), and [Wraith](https://i.imgur.com/mZQUgsC.png) on there. **BUT HANG ON!** Let me be honest here, if you're looking to get stickers just know that the print quality on regular stickers from RB is *PRETTY BAD* (they have glossy and transparent stickers too, I dunno if the quality is better on those) - weirdly, the print quality on like everything else is pretty good though, just the stickers are bad in my experience. And, yes, I'm still planning on doing an etsy shop with good quality stickers.

**Next up**: Probably the Oni, but I think I'm going to take a couple weeks off of this DBD series, I'm getting a little burnt out, and I have an idea for a poster for Us as a companion to my Midsommar and Hereditary ones I want to do. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To answer some common questions:

> ""Are you / when are you going to do X killer?""

Yes, I'm planning to do all of them, including The Oni and whoever else gets revealed. I don't have them planned out in terms of when I'm doing which killer - just kinda of letting it happen. I know everyone is chomping at the bit for Legion, and I have some solid ideas for them, but they'll probably be who I do last because I'm an asshole.

> ""Are you going to do the survivors?""

No. I did Dwight because he's my boy (and I wanted to do a pizzagram), but generally speaking the survivors aren't as visually interesting and they don't have the sort of strong iconography that makes doing the killers engaging from a design perspective. Oh, and also I'm shit at doing faces (as you can see with my Dwight).

> ""Can I use this design for a tattoo?""

My stance on tattoo design is to contact me via DM and we can hash out the details but, generally, yeah, I'm cool with that.

> What equipment/apps do you use?

Most of the work is done in Procreate on an ipad / apple pencil combo with some occasional photoshop involved.


> Are you making stickers / prints?

Yes. The plan is to open an etsy shop when I finish all of the killers - probably sometime q1 next year.

There was a bit of a holiday lull there for me - other projects have been taking priority and then, of course, just general christmas busyness - but, back to that fog grind.

Man - Freddie was one I've been dreading from the get go. He has so much gravitas behind him, he's a real horror icon, you know? A lot of weight came along with this one. I really struggled with things I WANTED to do from the movies... but this is a series about the Dead by Daylight video game killers... not the licensed killer's source material. Which meant I couldn't do his long creepy arms from the school in the first movie, or him turning into a killer motorcycle from Dream Warriors, or any of the goofy stuff he's known for. That being said I think the blood warden gate came out out great and I'm pretty happy with this one, overall.

Also, I have updated my [redbubble store](https://www.redbubble.com/people/gopencyprep) with a lot of new stuff - there isn't a lot of DBD stuff on there right now (navigating the vagaries of copyright violations on redbubble is a bit hit or miss) but there are head stickers for [Hag](https://i.imgur.com/5DIzVYB.png), [Huntress](https://i.imgur.com/tUfIH1i.png), and [Wraith](https://i.imgur.com/mZQUgsC.png) on there. **BUT HANG ON!** Let me be honest here, if you're looking to get stickers just know that the print quality on regular stickers from RB is *PRETTY BAD* (they have glossy and transparent stickers too, I dunno if the quality is better on those) - weirdly, the print quality on like everything else is pretty good though, just the stickers are bad in my experience. And, yes, I'm still planning on doing an etsy shop with good quality stickers.

Oh, also check out this redesign I did of my [Midsommar](https://i.imgur.com/W4ns8Dk.jpg) poster... which has nothing to do with DBD, I'm just super stoked on it.

I promise my posts won't be *this* grossly self-promoting after this one.

To answer some common questions:

> ""Are you / when are you going to do X killer?""

Yes, I'm planning to do all of them, including The Oni and whoever else gets revealed. I don't have them planned out in terms of when I'm doing which killer - just kinda of letting it happen. I know everyone is chomping at the bit for Legion, and I have some solid ideas for them, but they'll probably be who I do last because I'm an asshole.

> ""Are you going to do the survivors?""

No. I did Dwight because he's my boy (and I wanted to do a pizzagram), but generally speaking the survivors aren't as visually interesting and they don't have the sort of strong iconography that makes doing the killers engaging from a design perspective. Oh, and also I'm shit at doing faces (as you can see with my Dwight).

> ""Can I use this design for a tattoo?""

My stance on tattoo design is to contact me via DM and we can hash out the details but, generally, yeah, I'm cool with that.

> What equipment/apps do you use?

Most of the work is done in Procreate on an ipad / apple pencil combo with some occasional photoshop involved.


> Are you making stickers / prints?

Yes. The plan is to open an etsy shop when I finish all of the killers - probably sometime q1 next year.

> What else do you work on?

Lately, I've been super busy with photography - and since I promise my posts won't be so vulgarly self-promoting after this one, forgive me for showing off a bit (I'm pretty excited about the progress I made in photography in 2019):
