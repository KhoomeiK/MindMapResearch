dontputyourdickinthat,feklxd2,t1_fekjto2,1579202789.0,"I threw in cocaine to cancel out the effects of chloroform and acid for spooky hallucinations which should then cancel out the Viagra. Now wait til he takes a sip again.

Edit: He didn't take a sip, that dude came back for his beer. He dead now."

dontputyourdickinthat,fekd5rt,t1_fek8nfd,1579197565.0,"You put chloroform in his drink, I threw a pill of Viagra in it. Is there a chemistry nerd available to tell what's gonna happen."
aww,fekbgem,t1_fejw1bi,1579196555.0,"Fangs, I couldn't stand it either"
aww,fdwlmhw,t1_fdwgmaq,1578759927.0,"The things you listed. Pain, heartbreak, depression. For you it isn't only asking, it's listening too (reading the Bible). You probably don't want to hear it from me, but God does love you and want to take it away. Just thank him every day for what he has given you. All your fortune and the fact that he sacrificed his son for you and all the things you listed will be taken away. Acts 16 verse 16 to 26 you read about Paul getting beaten again, he reacts with prayer and praise and gets saved."
aww,fdw2mur,t1_fdvtzsg,1578754405.0,"Yes, I personally experience him in my life. For the people that don't believe in miracles, I graduated. Truly a miracle. I'm kinda ashamed."
aww,fdw26o6,t1_fdvug49,1578754226.0,"You shouldn't believe everything on the internet. Also Google isn't a living thing, so it doesn't count as a real friend, sorry. 

There is no conclusive evidence that God isn't real. You say this as if you have evidence. Maybe use that."
aww,fdw0rx7,t1_fdvv824,1578753825.0,"A non hands-on God, cus it's powerful enough to create everything, it just can't intervene, weird. A sadistic God, you must see the irony in that. 

Humans aren't perfect. If you were to aim a gun at someone and you pull the trigger, will it fire. Of course it does. You can do things of your own choosing. Of course if either one of you believes in God AND you ask, then he cloud make it that the gun would Jam. 

Torture and rape are things that happen, even in the Bible. Bad things can happen to you. This is isn't something God created. He doesn't do this and he isn't your unwanted savior. When you die and stand in front of him, he decides whether you go to heaven or hell. You will probably ask him why he let it all happen, he would probably say: I wasn't asked."
aww,fdvx91v,t1_fdvvcqv,1578752751.0,I'm not offended because I'm crazy enough to believe in God. I'm offended because I was offended. If you think it is ok to make fun of someone's believes then you are part of the ~80%.
aww,fdvoef4,t1_fdvk1oa,1578749650.0,"What exactly is it that makes humanity shitty, when people believe in God while there is access to Internet. Cus right now it seems to be the people that respond to them."
aww,fdvnrcg,t1_fdvm9t6,1578749470.0,Atheism is honestly the weirdest believe there is.
aww,fdvmral,t1_fduwdfe,1578749152.0,"This is very offensive towards everybody that believes in God. This includes all the Christians, Jews and Muslims. Thas must be most of the human earthlings."

instantkarma,fca03nu,t3_egursm,1577560801.0,"Litter is honestly the weirdest thing assholes do. I honestly don't get the aversion for holding on to your junk until you find a trash can. It's not like you need to keep it in your hand while driving. Or when you walk it's not that bad to keep it in your hand for a while, cus there are literally trash cans everywhere."
