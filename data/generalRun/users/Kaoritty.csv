JUSTNOFAMILY,fgpzeg7,t3_ezlpmh,1581014935.0,I'm sorry you are dealing with so much. I hope you get a break from all the stress soon. Aging parents can be super tough to deal with.
politics,fgmoaba,t1_fgm5y4b,1580928667.0,Yep it’s racism that falls along the lines of “it’s not racist! It’s just the truth!” And “I’m not a racist because my friend is black!”

worldnews,fglpqcy,t3_ez2bfq,1580907530.0,"When republicans try to play both sides by stating that they think the president did something wrong, but they can't vote for impeachment/witnesses/etc because the process wasn't trustworthy, then they are just contributing to the partisanship, and what are they even basing this judgement of his actions on? They are basing it on the evidence collected via the ""partisan"" House investigation.

I've never like pads, and while I still use them on heavy days as a backup tampons, they are just prone to accidents and embarrassment. Your story reminded me of when I started to us tampons and the feeling of freedom from pad problems. It was definitely a great feeling. I used to have to use safety pins to keep pads in place because they were the bulky crap ones and I'm not sure when wings came out but my pads never had them. Changing my pad was an arduous process and tampons freed me of that. I'm glad you have been able to move on from the control of your parents in this manner."

democrats,ffqdp1q,t1_ffpsawc,1580131450.0,By fear mongering I meant  that for some there is a fear that Bernie winning the nomination would mean an insta-win for trump because he’s not appealing to those outside of his rabid base. I don’t really agree but some older people in my fam feel this way because they felt mistreated by Bernie supporters because they were HRC supporters all the way through 2016 and they can’t seem to get over that. I appreciate your response anecdote and all. :)

democrats,ffpkdcr,t1_ffpjcko,1580097155.0,Where is the evidence of this being the case? I ask because I’ve seen this point made a lot on Reddit and it’s even popped up on FB by a family member. I can’t help but think it’s fear mongering to derail Bernie while he’s doing so well. I don’t remember this ever being the approach in 2016 as a supporter of Bernie Sanders. I did vote for HC in the end.
atheism,ffpc3y1,t3_eue7d6,1580091340.0,I guess you can argue that believing in God is obviously not a prerequisite for living and that by not believing in God you are proving that God doesn’t exist or he doesn’t know how to close a blaring loophole of his own making.

askscience,ffn7gr1,t3_eu6tfh,1580062801.0,"I feel like it is becoming more common. There just isn’t the social and familial support system for families like there was 20+ years ago. Having a family is expensive and often requires stable housing, employment, and healthcare. That’s hard to come by for a lot of young people. Even if you try to muscle through the obstacles then you are also confronted with the hardships of trying conceive at an older age plus the fun that comes with getting older (medical issues popping up seemingly randomly)."

I think my favorite time for pvp was also wotlk because of Wintergrasp. Something I’ve noticed is that with these recent expacs, if you miss the world events then they have nothing to bring you in to the story later on. BFA was really disjointed for me because I didn’t get pulled into Teldrassil burning or night warrior stories. It was just like oh look, now you’re over here now!
