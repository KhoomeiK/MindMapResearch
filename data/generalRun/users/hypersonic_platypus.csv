""We knew that coronavirus represented a threat to humanity ... The concern now is that perhaps this is the coronavirus we've been fearing ... One that is more easily transmissible than SARS or MERS ... that could potentially cause tens or hundreds of thousands of deaths or even millions of deaths...""

Watch the video for the whole quote at 4m50s. He begins by saying the two recent ebols outbreaks were not a coincidence and ends by saying that epidemic disease is a systemic threat to the society we've built.

Seriously read LOTR as a teenager a couple of times then found out about The Silmarillion in my late teens and read that off and on until the movies started coming out. 

I'd say an adult could start with Lord of the Rings then try the Silmarillion.
