MurderedByWords,ffc9j6d,t1_ffc5xw0,1579794619.0,"> You have a source on heating rocks being more efficient than an in-home water heater?

Yeah dumbass. It's called a closed system. Your water heater is heating up GALLONS of running water thru your piping system. Steam rooms heat up less than a single gallon of water and vaporize it.

Average US shower uses 2.1 gallons a minute. So for 45 minutes you're using about 90-100 gallons of water (360 liters). A hot shower is 110 F (43 C).

To heat up 360 L of water from ground temp 52 F (11 C) to 110 F (43 C) would take 13.47 KwH to do 100% efficiently. 

Saunas range from 3 to 8 KwH and they produce a room temp reaching 140 F. 

If you think an open system heating water and dumping it down a drain is more efficient than a closed system then you need to rethink your logic."
