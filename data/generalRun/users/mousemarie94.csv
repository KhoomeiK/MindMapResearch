That's the exact reason that when I started managing--I made sure to ""be the change"" I wanted to see in the managing world...a.k.a at the time I started, I was a teenager who saw the way my boss was treating people and said ""NOPE. Not doing THAT."" Haha.

Shitty managers really ruin reputations and productivity. One bad apple can truly spoil the bunch."

I didnt read your response because I already know it has nothing to offer to the conversation & it isnt because I think my academic background or years of real world experience triumphs yours but because...I KNOW theres no way you truly understand anything beyond an elementary level based on previous comments.

Have a good day though."

You cant even get through the narrative without contradicting yourself. 

You're not willing to accept your very pivotal role and influence in the decision. Take accountability and discuss her feelings about the medical procedure she had which has obviously created some issues for her..."

MaliciousCompliance,fdmaz2r,t3_em1oju,1578544302.0,"Good on ya. Also, best practice. As a manager, I ALWAYS tell staff- if you are telling me about something regarding leaving early, arriving late, or not coming in (in advance)...email it to me so it is in writing because the amount of things I do in a day-- remembering or even remembering where I wrote something down while I was in the middle of a report/project doesnt have a high likelihood. We have attendance through an online system and I still tell people to send emails as backup so it is super clear to me, to you, and the powers that be...that it was communicated."
