It's a funny ASMR video where you can relax and have a good laugh all at the same time. My favorite are the ones where I take a situation that's stressful and try to make it relaxing.

Did they wear the costumes? “Hey guys, quit fucking around people are trying to orgy.” Then I realized that I don’t know orgy rules, so I tried to stop thinking about it.
