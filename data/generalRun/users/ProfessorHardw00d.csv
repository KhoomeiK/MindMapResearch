wholesomememes,ffedq9q,t1_ffebvzt,1579844247.0,"Yeah, I guess that’s really the only way for crypto to become stable. By people actually wanting to use it instead of another currency. 

I think with how our world is constantly getting smaller through social media and other technologies the global economy is becoming more important to everyone. When the global economy is doing good then everyone is doing good. If we lived in a world where everyone used the same currency everything would be so much more simple and easier for us to function as a planet instead of individual countries. 

Crypto definitely has some cool potential but it is trying to shake up what is potentially the most important thing in our world today, money. That’s no small task. It may take some time but it could be amazing when it gets there."

wholesomememes,ffe8rwq,t1_ffe6rh3,1579839814.0,"That’s awesome man. I don’t know a ton about crypto currency but I like the idea of it. The ability of it to be completely unregulated by any specific entity is amazing and exactly what a free market economy should use in the future. I also think it’s really cool that in the future it’s possible that we never have to use our credit/debit cards and cash again because we just pay with crypto. The example I heard was that we could be going to buy gas for our car and when it’s time to pay the gas pump accesses our car’s money account and pays for itself. So everything could just have it’s own ability to connect to where we store our crypto and pay seamlessly. 

With the price changing pretty frequently and drastically how is a way that a currency like BitCoin could become used commonly today?"
aww,ffe6whh,t3_et0aa6,1579838304.0,"We had our own tripod who lost his after getting caught in some kind of trap. He came back to the house limping and you could see the teeth marks from the trap on his leg. Got him amputated the next day and pretty soon he was up and running around just as he was before. He was still fast as anything despite missing that leg but got tired a little quicker than he used to. 

One weird thing was that after he got it amputated he would try to pee on things by lifting his back leg despite only having one back there. It was hilarious to watch."

It takes a lot of time to kill and eat an animal so they’d have to carry it away. I’m pretty sure doing that while getting chased isn’t a great option for them in their mind. 

It’s better than trying nothing. You would normally think that in a situation of 3 wolves vs a dog would definitely result in the dog dying so if that’s probably going to happen then doing something to attempt to help can’t really make it worse. Of course the dog gets away in this situation but unless this just happens all the time the person filming didn’t know that would happen."

ThatsInsane,ffask36,t1_ffasb34,1579743502.0,"I feel like dying is more of an important thing for the dog to avoid than the importance of killing the dog is to the wolves. Most predatory animals have a pretty low rate of successfully killing something so they do it a lot. The dog has never died and really wants to keep it that way. So, I’d say it’s a lot less likely for the dog to be the one that’s distracted in that situation, but I guess it’s possible lol"
