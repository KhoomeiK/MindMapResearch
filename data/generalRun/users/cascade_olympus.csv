It would be absurd if bricking *any* device was illegal, as virtually everybody in the world would be found guilty of having bricked a device at some point in their lifetime.

I at least understand why people would think that jailbreaking/rooting a phone would be illegal. Especially in the case of iPhones. Apple works pretty damned hard to try and make it sound like you're legally obligated to not touch anything on the phone without their express permission, and only if you pay them a ton of money."
pics,fffounh,t1_ffewvod,1579888578.0,"I think you mean jail breaking/rooting phones is illegal (though obviously the joke wouldn't work that way). The MTTF of a device would have to be pretty much infinite in order to make bricking it illegal, and even then you'd probably have to prove intent. Plus, at least in the US, rooting phones was made legal back in 2012."
Futurology,fff9tcw,t1_fff0r73,1579879225.0,"That is certainly an interesting take, though I hope it works in something about how we're bombarded by scientific  papers and news articles describing the inevitable and imminent end of our species as a result of our inaction and greed. Information showing that our planet is currently in the 2nd fastest mass extinction in Earth's history (outweighed only by a cataclysmic meteor impact). All the while our politicians argue to deregulate large companies, allowing them to police themselves (Which works great... just look at the shipping industry who got around air pollution regulations by pumping their emissions directly into the ocean instead of the air).

The amazing flow of information as a result of the internet should definitely not be overlooked. The average person has so much more access to the goings on of the world than when our only sources were news papers and/or a handful of radio/tv stations.

GetMotivated,ff3n50o,t1_ff3kq63,1579544610.0,"Suppose I should give more context on the show. The main characters know that the system is broken. That a person shouldn't be judged on their global impact from things they either cannot avoid or don't even know. They also accept that doing wrong knowingly is and should be punishable, but that infinite punishment is not an appropriate response to finite actions. That a person can become better, that given enough time the good can outweigh the bad.

The show revolves around a number of individuals who are flawed but make honest attempts at becoming better (Specifically, more kind and considerate of others). Those individuals are still sentenced for eternity, and the argument is being made that while they weren't good people, they can grow to become good. That an eternity of punishment makes no sense when applied to creatures which are capable of changing for the better."
GetMotivated,ff3eh3i,t3_er5erx,1579539423.0,"Seeing a whole lot of people looking at this like, ""I did monstrous things yesterday, I did slightly less monstrous things today! That makes me better, so that's what's important! This mindset is dumb"". That's not what it's saying. It's saying that the good you do now, the good you'll do tomorrow... it's not weighed down by the bad you did before. It is never a worthless goal to be a better person going forward. Just because you've done a lot of bad in your life doesn't mean you should just say, ""Fuck it! Done too much bad, no point now in trying to do good!"". No, being a bad person does not devalue a good act. A bad person should not resign themselves to staying that way.

This is what is meant by it not mattering if you're good or bad, that what is important is being better every day. You can't change the past, and you may never do enough good to outweigh the bad you've done, but it is absolutely more important what you do going forward. Important because you can still change the world for the better. Your past actions hold far less weight on the future than your current ones."
GetMotivated,ff3blvl,t1_ff2xwjj,1579537972.0,"This has nothing to do with punishing or not punishing. This is speaking to the value of an individual and their actions. A person might be on death row for horrible crimes, but it does not make them trying to be better meaningless. Nobody is so far gone that trying to be better loses its value. Yes, nothing might make up for the things a person has done in their past, and it's not like a prison sentence should be reversed because they decided to try and be better... but it shouldn't be a case where you just throw up your hands and say, ""Oop, done too much bad in my life, no point in trying to do any good now!"". There is *always* value in doing more good.

Edit: Mind you, in the show's case we're talking about an eternal afterlife. In the case of an infinite time span for doing good/bad, eventually you could definitely do enough good to outweigh your bad, regardless of what bad you'd done. So in their specific scenario you'd indeed be able to eventually work your way out of the eternal punishment."
GetMotivated,ff3ahq9,t1_ff2wutv,1579537407.0,"For context, the show implies that it is basically impossible to be a good person. That we're so heavily connected in our society, you cannot avoid inadvertently supporting corruption, unethical behaviors, hatred/violence, etc. The second bit speaks to it being more important that you strive to be better, even as the cloud of unintentional bad hovers over you."
GetMotivated,ff397gt,t1_ff2l13x,1579536656.0,Could argue the opposite too though... that it is more difficult for someone who started as a real jerk to try and be better. The person who started out pretty good would naturally find it easier to try to be a little better every day.
GetMotivated,ff38u9k,t1_ff2iqo0,1579536417.0,"The show touches on the concept that it is impossible to be good in today's society. Donate to charity, find out that money from the charity was being used to line corrupt individual's pockets. Buy a box of cereal, find out that the company producing it employs children in unsafe working conditions for pennies a day. 

The idea is that you cannot escape being a bad person, but it is more important that you strive to be a better person every day."
GetMotivated,ff36vky,t1_ff2olb2,1579535104.0,Thankfully it doesn't matter what others hold on to regarding your past. All that matters is that *you* know you're striving to be better!

Futurology,fejwg4a,t3_epj53x,1579187420.0,"We need to spread awareness of magnetic charging cables. Pretty much all of them come with all 3 common port heads. Instead of using an entirely different cord, you just plug the correct charging heads into each of your devices and can use the same cord across the board. Not only that, but you can also plug in any of your chargeables with a single hand and zero effort. As a further additional plus, if anything hits or yanks on your cable, the cable releases rather than messing up your charging port or cable.

They're also cheaper than normal cords more often than not... [here's one of the sets I've gotten](https://www.amazon.com/NetDot-Magnetic-Compatible-Smartphones-i-Product/dp/B07JZ3NB7G/), for anybody interested."
AskReddit,fej13lt,t1_fegfn5q,1579153124.0,"I can't speak to 2, 3, or 4... but friends? Easiest way to make those in adult life is to pick up a hobby that is frequently a group activity. Hiking, join a rock wall gym, pick up a craft and get group classes, if you like gaming then join a gaming community, etc. 

You have to try way harder as an adult to get friends than you ever did as a kid, but putting yourself in the position to meet people is key. Heck, might solve your other problems by accident. Might find an SO who shares the hobby you choose. Might meet someone higher up in a job field that you're interested in - after all, they say it's not *what* you know, but *who* you know.

I mean, yeah, I get that I'm a bald basement dwelling neckbeard who might (probably) look scary to kids. Doesn't seem to phase all of my other nieces and nephews. I really hope it's just that, and nothing more. I myself am a bit terrified that I could become the target of ""creepy uncle"" talks. Pretty much lock myself away and refuse any requests to babysit when they are around, as to avoid accusations, and to avoid making her needlessly uncomfortable.

Warframe,fcwg26a,t1_fcuthwu,1578024697.0,"What's nice about Baruuk is that he's got (I believe?) the highest dmg resistance of any frame in the game while also hitting for 4-10mil dmg with his heavy attacks. Also has the option to use normal attacks to clear rooms of lesser enemies. Very well rounded tank/dps with some alright group support through his sleep which he's using to keep up the restraint meter and the dmg resistance daggers he's constantly sharing with nearby allies.

Ash is a bit more *finicky* to play imo, but true that we can't argue with the numbers he puts out when built and played correctly."

Most folks I've had try either just end up feeling lost and directionless.

As much as I think WoW is a dying game, the reason it became so huge was a result of how approachable it is. Would be my suggestion for starting MMOs... though would warn anybody starting that it is a game on the decline.

Otherwise, Archeage Unchained if the individual wants a less ""on rails"" experience while still retaining the comforts of newer MMO approachability."

I don't remember ever being asked to help, but seeing her get as stressed as she was prompted me to want to help out. I now do the bulk of the cooking every holiday season (as well as the associated cleanup and shopping). This year was one of our most packed with us + 7 adults and 6 children all staying with us since the 20th until whenever they decide they want to go home. Every meal is a bit of a marathon, but I know if I didn't do it, my mom would have had a complete mental breakdown.

Mind you, I'm a guy, but I absolutely see what you're saying. Every year, the only people who ask if they can help with anything are the women in our family. The men just sit around playing on their phones or watching TV while talking about sports and weather. It's really weird always being surrounded by all of the women during the holidays while we play host to the rest, but honestly I'd feel even more awkward sitting on a couch with the guys while people hustled around me to make everything perfect for me.

No idea what's going through the minds of the majority of my fellow men. If you happen to be a guy reading this from your couch right now while someone else is doing all the work, consider getting up and asking if there is anything you can do to help!"
