PublicFreakout,fg8mw54,t1_fg8mldq,1580624826.0,Possibly. Personally I disagree but that video was far too short and the actual offense wasn't shown so I don't think either of us can form a proper opinion. Context is everything and it's been stated several times that she most likely won't serve more than a few days.
PublicFreakout,fg8maa2,t1_fg8lo0c,1580624172.0,It's [contempt of court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court) which is a [process crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_crime). What she did was punishable under the law.

PublicFreakout,fg7xbkn,t1_fg7wz18,1580603860.0,"Given the context it's an absolutely appropriate punishment, fuck her. Scare some human decency into her and make an example of upholding proper respect in a court room. Plus as others have said it's a bit of a scare tactic so she'll most likely not serve the entire time."

PublicFreakout,fg7nbuc,t1_fg7ml7u,1580596690.0,That's still no excuse. Learn to manage your social behavior because clearly this isn't a common occurrence in a court room if that judge was so upset by it. She was rightfully punished.
pics,ffpv9pq,t1_ffputv9,1580107036.0,I'm not speaking for other people and I'm not trying to answer a question. You've read what I said so you know my stance already so your question is unfair. My entire point has been that humans are complicated and because of that everything makes less sense the more your dig deeper. You clearly have a personal stake in this topic so no matter what I say it'll just upset you more anyways. Sorry man :( But we're done here.

You have your reasons to hate and it's not my place to try and help you find peace but I think you read what I said unintentionally wrong. I'm not really a good enough writer to explain what I really meant in simple terms. We're just cut from a different cloth I guess.
mildlyinteresting,ffpsqkw,t1_ffpsd52,1580104330.0,Yeah well your dad was a block head and your mother was a real piece. I'm not surprised you connect well with them.
pics,ffprl7y,t1_ffpqmut,1580103199.0,"I'm just trying to think of it all in a realistic light. You think all 900,000 were in on it twirling their mustaches as they bellied a maniacal laugh? We're not a hiveminded animal, we're social and even the smallest of groups can differ greatly from its parent branch. Here's an example that might shed some light on this: America has a bad reputation for police brutality no? Therefore the actions of those determine the morality of the entire system, right? The phrase ""One bad apple spoils the bunch"" is thrown around a lot regarding that issue and I agree that compliance even without direct involvement is worthy of punishment in most circumstances. We also know plenty of police jurisdictions that have a precinct full of saints who would fight to the death for your rights and ignore unfair laws when it's appropriate. Things are complicated and the further you look into it the less it makes sense. You had villainous American WWII soldiers just as much as you had heroic German ones. Once you understand that other people have a lifetime of knowledge and memories and experiences just like you then you'll start to see war in a different light. War is not like a game of Risk, those pieces had a life of their own and to dismiss it all for any reason is doing history a disservice."

pics,ffpoqkm,t1_ffpnuqn,1580100573.0,"The Waffen-SS was roughly 900,000+ strong. That's a lot of people. Do you believe all of them were on the same page? They all lived a life before hand and held a unique view on the world and fought for different reasons regardless of how similar some may seem. I think you might be taking what I said wrong so let me confirm that I do NOT agree with what they did and regardless of their reasoning a bad deed is a bad deed. But to ignore the human element and to toss a blanket judgement call on a group of people is counter productive. We need to understand why people followed in the first place and what caused them to join the fight so we can study that behavior and try to prevent it from happening again."
pics,ffpnsf4,t1_ffpmw28,1580099779.0,"That's something I can't answer because if the solution was simple we would have solved this problem long ago. People are a complicated creature living in a complicated machine that has no rhyme or reason, so the best anyone can do it spread happiness and joy wherever they go. Be good to yourself and those around you is a good place to start. Other than that I don't think anyone can answer your question with confidence."
pics,ffpj3t5,t1_ffpgnuz,1580096251.0,"Exactly. Good and evil is not so cut and dried as we wish it was. Everything is far more complicated than all of that and I find it important to dig deeper on these issues. See everyone as human and understand that people can often be unpredictable. Each individual Nazi had an different reason for fighting much like any of the Americans or other Allied nations such as a draft, the money, patriotism, orders, pride, anger or even the excitement of battle. Over time history becomes more black and white and now that we have the knowledge and technology to keep proper track I think It's about time we stop brushing off our past mistakes as an impossible recurrence."
pics,ffpgda6,t1_ffpfinq,1580094379.0,Placing a group or a person up on a pedestal can often be counter productive. We start to view them as some sort of mythical tale as time goes on and people often exclude applying basic human virtues on them. We begin to forget they were just like us; Human. If a fantastical element is applied to something then people start to view there deeds as unachievable accomplishments and forget how they got there in the first place. Seeing the enemy through anger will only bring you sorrow and hate.
pics,ffpdhko,t1_ffpcc00,1580092316.0,"Yeah, people often forget that they were not literal demons from hell. They were people who followed orders and protocols as best they can. It was not an unorganized mass of pure evil, humanizing the Nazi's or any other enemy helps prevent losing the knowledge of why it all happened in the first place. It helps cement the value of learning from our mistakes. The Nazi's were all people too and life is far more complicated then ""they fought for the wrong side so they are pure evil"".  We need to focus on attacking the ideology more than those that followed it willingly or otherwise. Kill the hate at it's source because chasing after the ambers usually doesn't help in the long run."

movies,ffp15kz,t1_fflcfly,1580084181.0,I reflected on your comment and I agree. I'm not sure why I said all that because I'm a major fan of animated films so I too see the quality of it through adult eyes. You're absolutely right on the popularity in other genres... If we went that route every MCU movie would dominate Best Picture. I guess I'm just not educated enough to form a solid opinion but what I do know is that the awards are still broken. How it can be fixed is beyond me though.
movies,ffksoh5,t1_ffjowb0,1580028186.0,"I'm unsure if this is an unpopular opinion or not but to me that sorta makes sense in a way... Some artsy fartsy animated film might be of better quality but there is merit in a film being a hit with its intended demographic. If an animated film wins the award but it bores children to death then it creates a whole new problem. Parents will look up that movie and see it has rave reviews and won all these awards but it was all judged through the eyes of adults. If the animated section had more variety (Best voice acting would be a great start but you could also add in best original/adapted screenplay for an animated film, best animated cinematography and so on and so forth) it'll level the playing field a little."

news,fexir78,t1_fexf8w5,1579431653.0,That was just my somewhat uneducated opinion based on what I've experienced and witnessed. I do agree with you in general but it's all based on context. For example: places have been charged for giving away their leftover food to the homeless at the end of the day because they didn't have a permit. That's bullshit to me and I'm well aware of the possible health code violations. But with some circumstances I do believe in not encouraging begging because it can do more harm than good. In some circumstances it would be far more wise to donate to your local shelters which are usually underfunded to hell.

news,fex8b9l,t1_fex5fza,1579426735.0,"Some places take that too far but I can understand the reasoning behind some of those laws. Panhandling can get really bad in some places and it can create a danger. People walking onto the road up to cars during a red light is one example, or the general harassment in high traffic areas. Some cities have some great programs to help the homeless as well but if people keep supporting them when they beg they're less likely to seek professional help/support and it encourages them to continue begging. Of course this isn't the case everywhere but it is one reason why you shouldn't give money away to the homeless in some places."
