Also give a listen to the bands Sons of Kemet and Shabaka and the Ancestors, since Shabaka Hutchings plays sax in all three."
wholesomememes,fddox5z,t1_fddi82y,1578319953.0,Not quite. See above

I had spilled a small amount while filling up a test tube, and somehow the ether either seeped through my nitrile gloves or I managed to inhale some. It kind of reminded me of being on nitrous oxide when I got my wisdom teeth removed, except I was really sleepy, and there was the lingering fear that I might not wake up. But thankfully I was ok."

Gin,fcxho9x,t1_fcx8bxv,1578063179.0,"That’s a great idea! I had only really done quick research to compare prices/see how common it was, but now that I actually have it I should reach out to them."

memes,fcwjo0e,t3_ej7lar,1578027444.0,It isn’t but it reminds me of Lindsay Lohan in the first Machete
Gin,fcvx6na,t1_fcvwf14,1578012131.0,"No idea. There’s nothing on the back, and I haven’t seen any similar signs on the internet"
