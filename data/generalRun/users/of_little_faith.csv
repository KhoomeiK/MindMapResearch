They cost me weeks away from my family, sleeping in hotels, visiting places I’ve never been and won’t get to see because I move from airport, to rental car, to meeting rooms, and back, and don’t always have time for more than a meal out.

Yes, I earn points/miles in the process and have enjoyed some “free” travel perks, but I don’t want them. I want to sleep in my own bed and wake up next to my wife. 

Hell if I would give those “free” miles to somebody else. I paid for them and so has my family."
