ApplyingToCollege,ffwpy6c,t3_eucgek,1580308149.0,"I do alumni interviews, and the admissions team told us that interviews are the deciding factor in about 20% of decisions. So 80% of decisions (accepted or rejected) are made without ever considering the interview report. For candidates on the edge, that's where interviews matter."

PennStateUniversity,ff5lvqj,t1_ff5hzb1,1579599311.0,Been inhaling a little too much Fox News?   You just saw a headline about the environment and  immediately started spewing media attacks.  The article is not political nor does it especially use emotion in its writing.
learnprogramming,ff244em,t3_er7l7o,1579493280.0,"A stack is last-in, first-out.  It can be implemented quite well with a singly linked list.  The next thing to pop off the stack is always the first thing on the list, making it O(1).  And adding something to the stack is just inserting a new element to the front of the list.  Since it's just twiddling pointers on the list and the new item to insert, it's also O(1).  

Although a linked list does work well for a stack, an array can be even simpler.  As a result, stacks are more often implemented on arrays than on linked lists."

Maybe I missed part of the conversation, but then what makes you ask about Chromecasts?  If it's a smart TV, maybe one of its apps was previously registered to someone else and a factory reset of the TV would work."

Royalty free means you do not need to pay to use it on an ongoing basis (i.e. per listen).  But, it may be licensed in such a way that you need to ask permission, include an attribution, or even include some type of link.  Also, there may be a one-time license fee when you start.

That being said, it's not uncommon for royalty free music to also be free of other charges and be licensed for any use by anyone.  But you should definitely double-check, not assume."

Sports games ruined, mature content when kids were watching, channels that people don't watch (and find offensive), news channels covering hate content, and just general dislike for the unwanted noise.

learnprogramming,fdmysm0,t3_em7xvd,1578571701.0,"REST is more common. 

Personally, I've not been troubled by the ""chatty client"" problem that GrapgQL solves. Maybe my query cases have been simpler than others or I haven't been strictly RESTful, but I don't especially think so. I do usually prefer stronger typing, which is a benefit of GraphQL over REST, but the simplicity of REST and its testing and monitoring tools are compelling for me."
learnprogramming,fdmxh3v,t3_em8b64,1578570202.0,"Web front end is much simpler. You're essentially creating pages for a single user at a time without much concern for availability, scalability, durability, or security. Typically all of these issues are handled on the server, and the web frontend is regarded as an ephemeral, untrusted client. The web is simpler and (by design) has much lower standards.

Front end app development is harder. Security is more of a concern since apps are often trusted code, and you need to consider issues like offline behavior, storage limits, and battery usage. I feel server side code is still more complicated, but app development is definitely more interesting than web pages."
