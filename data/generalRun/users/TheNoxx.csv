This might just prolong the problems involved and make an eventual crash worse, or it might be that the best way to fix a crashing stock market is to pull the big players aside and remind them it's all imaginary and just make them proceed in a non-destructive manner.

>One surprising smackdown occurred on Oct. 9 in federal bankruptcy court in the Southern District of New York. Ruling that a lender, PHH Mortgage, hadn’t proved its claim to a delinquent borrower’s home in White Plains, Judge Robert D. Drain wiped out a $461,263 mortgage debt on the property. That’s right: the mortgage debt disappeared, via a court order.

>So the ruling may put a new dynamic in play in the foreclosure mess: If the lender can’t come forward with proof of ownership, and judges don’t look kindly on that, then borrowers may have a stronger hand to play in court and, apparently, may even be able to stay in their homes mortgage-free.

>The reason that notes have gone missing is the huge mass of mortgage securitizations that occurred during the housing boom. Securitizations allowed for large pools of bank loans to be bundled and sold to legions of investors, but some of the nuts and bolts of the mortgage game — notes, for example — were never adequately tracked or recorded during the boom.

This is also done by intelligence agencies pushing their agenda; you can look at Standing Rivers and Jhanisse Daza as examples of puppets pushing CIA talking points through the mask of virtue signaling. After the military coup in Bolivia, Daza was tweeting things like she ""had tears of joy that Bolivia had a great and beautiful female president""... while that freakshow CIA backed fascist ""president"" was saying insanely racist shit about forcing the indigenous peoples out of the cities and that they were satanist animals.

If you see an organization funded by the National Endowment for Democracy, or NED, there's a good chance they're CIA puppets.

Ethnicity and the genetic history of peoples, archaeogenetics, is very much a field of study. That's why you can literally send off your blood to a lab and tell where your ancestors came from.

It really comes down simply to political capital and will. If the fourth estate was doing it's job as it had in the 30's, we could have laws like this passed and they'd be written well enough that most everyone would be caught if they tried to cheat.

For example, overtime pay should have similar loopholes: just have your employees work 40 hours for Company A and then clock in under Company B for anything more, right? And sure, some people try that and other tricks to scam employees out of wages.

But most of the people that try that graft get caught and get royally fucked by the Department of Labor."
