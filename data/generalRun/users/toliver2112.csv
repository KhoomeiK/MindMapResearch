rush,fffjc8h,t1_ffevvvp,1579885201.0,"Too bad about the keyboardist, that really would have made the song pop.  YYZ isn't easy and the pacing was really good.  I'm no music teacher but I think /u/cmanshazam was spot-on.  Your lead guitar player and bassist really seemed into the tune and while it wasn't perfect, having passion for the songs you are playing will drive you to be better.  The fact that you put this together quickly and did such a good job speaks volumes.  Don't worry about the issues you had with the drum set, your drumming was well done despite those challenges."
