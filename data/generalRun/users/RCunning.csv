DestinyTheGame,fcsyzeg,t1_fcslfxl,1577928638.0,"I have dbl. slap fights all the time. The one who can second slap first, wins. I'm not sure if increased melee speed would help though because there is usually some maneuvering between first hit and kill. Add in the net stuff and I just take it on the chin if I lose. If I cared to count, I'd say I win maybe 80ish percent of those encounters, so it's not the hill I'll die on.

In general, I'm cool with the class differences. I would be happy if there was a bit more power to the regular melee, though. No way I should hit someone unawares in the back of the head and they not take much damage, while Titans are sneezing on me and I'm out."
