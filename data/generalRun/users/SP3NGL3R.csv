I'm planning for $1M for each of my children (2 hopefully) to go to whatever school they like (on educational merit) and an early retirement for at least wife wife and me.

You can do it. Just stop caring what other people think and before you know it you'll be rolling by on freedom.


Ever notice that the truly fancy folk roll in driving a Toyota? Nah, cause you don't see that 401k at $1M+ or that comfortable townhome in a moderate area where they've already made $300k on it, or the $500k cash in ""we really should invest this"" money. Nah. All you see is a Toyota. When what you should be seeing is a Toyota with a fuck load of self confidence and awareness and planning on the trunk. Don't believe me? Drive through the $5M homes where you live. You'll see way more ""normal"" cars than fancy cars. Because. Those people be smart with their money. And.

nvidiashield,ff83dzf,t3_es5sm3,1579664922.0,"Personally. I got it for the native 4k to replace an HTPC NUC. Which don't get me wrong is amazing. But I wanted something designed for media. I haven't looked back. It's my streaming-everything box now. Local/etc. As it was designed to do.

Tip? Replace whatever random HDMI cables you've been using with latest tech versions. I went with 8k cables from MonoPrice (3 for $30) and I'm very happy with the results. 8k! Why? ... Because I'm annoyed with the guessing game of cable quality/capability. I'm running 4k with Atmos and want to be sure my cables aren't holding me back. So far. I'd say I'm 25% happier with everything because of the higher spec cables.

Tip2: don't forget it's an Android TV device, so there are plenty of apps out there to add. Just go get them.

Tip3: tell me if you figure out how to disable the dedicated Netflix button. I keep clicking it when I pick up the remote in the dark.

Tip4: commit to it for a week like I did. I now only switch to the HTPC if I want to freely browser the internet (think Amazon on the TV). Now I don't care if the audio on Win10 is locked to an app for quality, or worried about signal buffering/rendering."

It's my backend on media and almost all connected devices (WiFi/LAN) will play ""original"" format when using the Plex App (Shield/Roku/Xbox). Only problem is if I do a lot of rewinding bit by bit, like 10seconds 10 times quickly. It seems to mess up there server budget or something. Usually recovers in a minute though. I haven't tested the new Shield as a server yet, but I imagine if your client devices don't demand it to transcode it'll do just fine passing the raw content to modern clients. ...

BUT! 1 I can toggle to another input and have a full blown PC to do what I want. 2 it's (HTPC) got a bunch of other stuff running on it that uses the external HDDs that have my Plex content also. 3 it's the brains of my home operation, sonarr/radarr/etc.  I specifically bought the Shield to be an all-in-one kind of device that's also capable of talking to my Plex server and stream in the raw. I want dumb/powerful/dedicated devices supported by smart backend devices.

I just haven't tested it (yet) but having my library directly connected would be nifty. I wouldn't actually use it that way as it's currently connected to a server box where it needs to live.

nvidiashield,fdj7432,t1_fdfwyko,1578460319.0,"Can't say for certain. But it sure feels like it looks better. Ran some of the Dolby Atmos samplers to test (1k - 4k). Looked freaking spectacular and sounded even better. To be fair, my cross reference is a 20' HDMI (3D 4k version) connected to a Skull Canyon NUC PC and played through MPC-BE, versus now with a 3' 8k and Plex served to the Shield. My Soundbar switched to Atmos as expected, and it looked gorgeous. I'm not even seeing the old hotspots in my LED backlight (which I can't explain). With 1 hour in, I'd recommend.
