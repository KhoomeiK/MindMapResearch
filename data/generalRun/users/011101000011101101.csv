AskProgramming,ff4hmn5,t1_ff3p77w,1579563827.0,"Most people don't bother to learn too much of vim keybindings / commands. Learning how to use vscode natively should be much easier for you to pick up when compared to vim. I only use vim when I'm forced to. Like when I'm ssh'd into a remote server and vi/vim are the only text editors available. 

Other vim must-knows... There's different modes in vim - command, edit, append. You start up in command mode. If you start typing expecting text to go in, you'll be surprised that weird shit happens. Hit 'e' to go into edit mode. Hit escape when you're done to go back to command mode."
AskProgramming,ff4gzhq,t1_ff3p03s,1579563382.0,"Depends on the application and liklihood for reuse TBH. I write a lot of prototypes and POCs at work and there isn't always a next guy as more than half of the work gets thrown away. Other times I'll write something and it will be used and then not touched for months or years. Spending time doing a lot of little things like this slows you down.

However for software projects with an active team behind it, I agree with you. I think the use case you brought up of data management is the most clear cut case of when to put everything in constants.

Then I asked if that part was only in the jewish versions of the story because, as you said, it's not in the bible. Or at least I don't remember it being in there. Its been a few decades since i have read it.
