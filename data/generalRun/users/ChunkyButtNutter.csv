Geez, do you not realize how shitty this sounds? Stop trying to gatekeep other people's clothing."
actuallesbians,fem4rgn,t1_fem1p43,1579239729.0,"They literally have the word ""exclusion"" in their name though...their whole philosophy is excluding people that they don't consider to be LGBT from the community, which is wrong. And is that not what TERFs do, trying to exclude trans women because they don't consider them to be real women? 

Being LGBT is more than just what you identify as or who you're attracted to, it's a group of people who have been mistreated, bullied, or seen as ""different"" by society coming together and meeting other people that have gone through the same hardships, and realizing that we're really not that different at all. Asexuals are treated differently by society similar to how other LGBT people are, so why shouldn't they be allowed to be a part of the community? If straight allies are welcome, who's to say that aces aren't?

Bottom line: gatekeeping and exclusion is wrong, period. If that isn't enough to convince you to think otherwise about your position on exclusionists, then there's really not much else left to say."
actuallesbians,fem02fv,t1_felzaz5,1579235478.0,"I never said that it did, I just don't necessarily want to agree with a person (or, I guess people) who would try to gatekeep certain groups of people from a community. They may not be a discourse blog now, but when I was still on Tumblr they were most *definitely* a discourse blog."
actuallesbians,felzd17,t1_felx1wl,1579234886.0,"Ace exclusionists are like TERFs, but towards ace people. They try to bar aces from the community because they're not as oppressed as other groups. They treat us all as if we're cishets trying to invade the community, even if we identify as lesbian, bi, etc. They fail to understand that asexuality does not equal not having sex, similar to how TERFs fail to understand that trans women are not secretly men in disguise. Exclusionists will vehemently deny that the A in LGBTQIA stands for Ace, but go right around and say that it stands for Ally (which completely defeats the purpose of saying that you don't want straight people in the community).

A lot of them are extremely toxic towards the asexual community too, comparing us to people like Mike Pence and saying that they'd punch an ace person if they ever saw them at a pride parade (no joke, I've literally seen aphobes spout crap like this before). Hell, I've even seen some of them send death threats to a girl and almost got her to kill herself because she personally saw Artemis as ace instead of as a lesbian. 

They see nothing wrong with their actions and have no problem with putting the mental health of ace people at risk. So not only do I think that the ace exclusionist position is wrong, it's also extremely harmful."
