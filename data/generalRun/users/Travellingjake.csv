todayilearned,fd18wld,t3_ejr5x9,1578128732.0,"Also.........Chicken Tikka Masala was invented in Glasgow in the 60s.

(From the Book of General Ignorance):

Invented in Glasgow in the late 1960s, chicken tikka masala, or CTM, is Britain's most popular dish. There is no standard recipe. In a recent survey, the Real Curry Guide tested 48 different versions and found the only common ingredient was chicken.

Chicken tikka is a traditional Bangladeshi dish in with pieces of marinated chicken are cooked in a clay oven called a tandoor. This ancient style of cooking originated in the Middle East, the word deriving from the Babylonian *tinuru*, meaning 'fire'.

The first chicken tandoori on a British restaurant menu was at the Gaylord in Mortimer Street, London, in 1966 - the same restaurant where Not the Nine O'Clock News was invented in 1979. The recipe reached Glasgow shortly afterwards and when, as the legend goes, a customer asked for some gravy to go with it, the chef improvised with tomato soup, spices and cream.

*Masala* means a mixture of spices, and the usual CTM contains ginger and garlic, tomatoes, butter and cream, spiced with cardamom, cloves, cumin, nutmeg, mild red chilli powder and paprika, fenugreek and turmeric.

It is the turmeric that gives it the bright yellow colour, although the synthetic dye tartrazine is often substituted (it is tartrazine, among other unpleasant things, that makes curry stains impossible to remove from clothing). CTM doesn't have a standard style or colour: it can be yellow, brown, red or green and chilli hot; creamy and mild; or very smooth and sweet.

On in seven curries sold in the UK are CTMs - 23 million potions a year."
