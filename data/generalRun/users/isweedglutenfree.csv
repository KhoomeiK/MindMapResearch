I love 70s style. I‚Äôm going to add that to my descriptions in my comments, thank you for the reminder. Do you have any photo examples of the perm look you‚Äôre thinking?"
femalehairadvice,fdfroaw,t3_el57b0,1578368545.0,"Thank you so much!! I‚Äôve outlined my answers below:

1.	‚Å†How much time do you spend/are you willing to spend on your hair?
I‚Äôd like to be able to spend minimal time on my hair but willing to spend more for a good look. When growing up, my hair was closer to my should and I had to blow dry and flat iron it every day or else my hair went all over the place. After growing it out more, it appears I have wavy/curly hair (not really noticeable in this pic but I went way too long between cute) and it holds itself better long

2.	‚Å†Do you use or are you willing to use products or hot tools?
No but I am willing. This is me going to bed with damp hair and brushing it when I wake up
3.	‚Å†How long has it been since your last haircut? Is your hair damaged? Color treated?
6 months I think. No damage except for split ends bc it‚Äôs been so long since my last haircut. No color treatment either
4.	‚Å†Are there any parts of your face shape that you don‚Äôt want to accentuate? What about parts you do?
I have no idea what I would want to accentuate... I used to have side bangs that I felt helped frame my face to balance it better but I tried growing out my bangs a year ago to do something different. Now whenever I try to curl my hair or even not styling, the top looks flat and bleh. I didn‚Äôt get the long sweeping bangs I was hoping for; they just fell back. I feel it makes me look bleh. Side bangs aren‚Äôt really in anymore so that‚Äôs another reason I grew them. I gained weight over the last two years and I feel this makes my face look bigger/rounder/fatter and same for my forehead. Boring, bleh, and basic
5.	‚Å†How would you describe your style?
Perhaps classic with trendy influences
6.	‚Å†Do you have any limits on length?
I‚Äôd like to avoid a pixie cut but almost every dm I‚Äôve gotten about my hair has recommended it. I can get beautiful waves some days with the length that I have... I didn‚Äôt really notice how much curl it had until it got this long. It‚Äôs really the top half I have a problem with but if a styled look would frame my face better, that‚Äôs more what I‚Äôm looking for. Historically when I‚Äôve had shorter hair, it‚Äôs been frizzy/not quite polished

ETA: I love 70s style"
