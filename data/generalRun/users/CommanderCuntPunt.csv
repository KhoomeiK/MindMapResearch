The other is, like I said, why should they pay taxes on money they didn’t actually keep and was specifically given to an organization the governments recognizes as being a charity?

For example:

A grocery store has $200k in revenue for the year and $100k profit. They pay 30% tax on that $100k profit. 

Another grocery store has the exact same numbers. However $3k of its “profit” was those donations and they gave it all away. Because they ultimately gave that money to a tax exempt organization they don’t have to pay tax on it because from a tax perspective it isn’t profit. The grocery store than pays their standard tax rate on the $97k in profit."

When it comes to absolutely anything that effects them, their parent company, their major shareholders or their advertisers they are 100% focused on corporate interests. A lot of people call those views right wing, that isn’t fair, right wing politicians are just more shameless about promoting them. 

Coverage on healthcare for example is basically the same from both networks, they’ll just phrase things differently to get the reaction they want from their audience’s. CNN isn’t promoting Medicare for all, they call it too expensive and fail to acknowledge any of the real solutions the left proposes. Fox isn’t talking about improvements to free market insurance, they’re just making sure you think universal healthcare won’t work because of the left. Meanwhile the same god damn ads for medical companies making billions from the status quo fill the commercials. 

I think seeking out multiple sources is a great thing, but you are not seeing left wing views.

The US government isn’t making it cost more because they’re too involved, it’s the opposite.

The fact that we have to fund a massive bureaucracy that exists only to deny you coverage is another. But mainly it’s the fact that companies can treat us like a commodity.

If it hadn’t been Ferdinands assassination it would have been something else. Each side was convinced they would be done in a few months and would emerge as the new world power."
worldnews,fcygzcw,t1_fcyffk9,1578079956.0,"Why not? We did defeat the Iraqi army quickly, the problem is they just went home and became insurgents. 

Iran knows it can’t stand up against the US for long in a traditional war. It’s just too easy for us to bomb them with impunity. The leadership would go into hiding and military command would split into dozens of cells and they’d begin picking off troops. They’d hit us fast and escape into the crowd of civilians who would be recording. Give it a few months of videos of soldiers dying in agony on the news with no real progress and the public won’t stand for it. 

Iran isn’t Iraq, they’re prepared for an insurgency and unless we declare war on the civilians we cannot win in any way that’s meaningful in the long term."

We’d defeat the armies fairly quickly and then the insurgency would most likely drive us out in a couple years. During that time Russia, China and a few others would make a few more reasonable power grabs so in the end they’ll come out ahead while we suffer an embarrassing defeat."
