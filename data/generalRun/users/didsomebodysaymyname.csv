All stairs are safety hazards...people die or are seriously injured falling down stairs all the time.

>That's like saying ""Is it a code problem if the floor ends in a dropoff if there is other floor that doesn't?""

It's really not. Codes are not some ultimate protection for everyone in every situation. Here's a simple example: many railings are too low for tall people. It would be much easier to topple over them for someone over 6 ft. But the codes pick a height and that's the minimum for railings. If your center of gravity is above that? Too bad asshole.

It would not. That is a seperate hard to explain situation. The point is that in some, but not all, circumstances a non-professional can draw a reasonable conclusion based on available evidence.

>None of the 'evidence' you said was already avaliable is conclusive at all.

It absolutely was. That's why experts said I was right.

>bUt u WeRe rItE. Good for you. The person who though Iran shot it down because they're all brown also got the right answer. What a prestigious club to be in.

Haha, what? Where did I say this was about skin color?"

worldnews,fdku4my,t1_fdkqtsv,1578511202.0,">Trump broke the JCPOA because the millions of dollars of payoffs and capital investments under the terms of that deal were being funneled into terrorism across the Middle East. We were paying Iran to kill our own soldiers. 

That doesn't make any sense, the money was already transferred, breaking the deal, doesn't change how it's spent. The deal was about nuclear weapons. War would kill more Americans than the status quo.

>IMO no deal will be worth shit so long as the Iranian regime is still interested in sponsoring terrorism.

It's worth it if it prevents an all out war. There are other ways to address Iran's terrorism sponsorship."
worldnews,fdkpk6c,t1_fdkouz9,1578508484.0,">Except Iran basically said ""You back off, we'll come back to the table"".

Where have they said that? All I saw is them say that if the US doesn't retaliate, they won't, and that they're completely abandoning the JCPOA nuclear deal.

I didnt see anything about negotiating a new deal.

>So wait. You'll see.

If you're right and he gets a much better deal, great.

If it's basically the same deal, then why did we go to all this trouble?

If you're wrong, then things have gotten much worse. And he doesn't have a great record on making deals during his presidency."

worldnews,fdkoohf,t1_fdkngtz,1578507956.0,">they lost an important general we've had sights on for over a decade.

And every previous president agreed the cost of killing him was higher than the reward. Did Iran announce they're ending all their proxy wars?

>Our generals have called him a bigger threat that Bin Laden.

That doesn't mean it makes sense. Kim Jong Un is a huge threat, but killing him wouldn't make sense.

>And now we get a deal

We *had* a deal Trump broke it.

Also What deal? What's the win? What did Iran agree to *specifically*?

Nothing. This isn't a deal, it's an announcement.

There is no guarantee Iran will agree to a deal, especially after breaking a deal and assassinating the number two leader."
worldnews,fdknupw,t1_fdkncha,1578507458.0,"How long have we been sanctioning Iran?

They've never been overthrown, and they've never given in. Except I guess you could say the JCPOA nuclear deal, but in that case why did Trump break it?

Why should Iran trust Trump not to just break a new deal and sanction them again?"
