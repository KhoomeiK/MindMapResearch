AskAstrologers,ffexsqi,t3_et6d5m,1579869745.0,I struggle with this too. I’m assuming it’s the Martian ascendant and Pluto Square moon in your case :c
EntitledBitch,ffas6fa,t3_esds0w,1579743244.0,"Lmao, I love this subreddit"
BPD,ff9718s,t1_ff6my76,1579706343.0,"I think this has been my biggest struggle. And it makes me sad because I’ve been hospitalized over 7 times for suicide attempts and once for a drug overdose. I’m afraid my apparent competence will be the death of me, because people really don’t see how much I’m struggling"
BPD,ff65ut9,t1_ff652fz,1579619864.0,Got you!

BPD,ff5u328,t1_ff5tyh2,1579610273.0,I also mentioned that same goes with friends and family too.
BPD,ff5u1sv,t1_ff5tyh2,1579610238.0,"I’ve switched therapists and my current therapist is in extreme disagreement with what I’ve been diagnosed with in the past as well as what I know myself to struggle with. 

Can I ask what your purpose of all the questions are? I just want to know what your main point is here"
BPD,ff5rr2s,t1_ff56ia9,1579607702.0,"I relate to this 100%. I have an avoidant attachment style. So I keep things light and superficial with most people because the moment I start opening up too much, it turns into a spiral of dependency and chaos. My true symptoms only really come out in long term relationships and even friendships. My main problem is ghosting people as an attempt to self regulate... since I find it impossible to deal with my intense mood swings and would rather just avoid them"
BPD,ff5rngs,t1_ff5rfk5,1579607582.0,"But most importantly, I don’t believe in the idea that someone else knows you better than you can and should know yourself.. no matter how much schooling they have. This is actually a common practice in modern day psychotherapy. Diagnoses are dying as a result of therapists promoting self actualization through teaching clients to trust in theirselves and their hunches. I also work in the field."
BPD,ff5rfwz,t1_ff5rfk5,1579607331.0,Of course
