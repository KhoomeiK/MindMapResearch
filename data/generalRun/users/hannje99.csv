worldnews,ffakg9e,t1_ffa3xmk,1579737966.0,"if we stop investing in ""fossil"" fuel development, 1 billion  people will starve within 25 years.   That is a lot more certain than the nebulous effects  global warming predicts.   I would love to wake up tomorrow in a carbon neutral society.  I just don't think a 12 year old  should be making policy decisions  that could literally starve billions of people.  A twelve year old who probably has a bigger carbon footprint than 99% of the world. A twelve year old who ""demands""  immediate halt of fossil fuel investments.    A twelve year old who  hasn't taken any higher courses in economics, environmental sciences,  engineering, et al.  She is not qualified to make any decisions on anything other than what to wear to her 8th grade mixer.  The fact that global warmists trot her out as the face to their movement hurts their cause."
