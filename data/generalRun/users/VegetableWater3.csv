Unfortunately for the whole of Dubai it’s literally a last minute thought. Any house that was built 4 or more years ago weren’t thought out enough, the roofs all leak, windows all leak nothing stops the water. The roads have a small hole in the road every 500 m that get clogged through the year and when the annual rain comes, it COMES. And above that all the sand next to the roads? It’s mud and dirt all over the road when it finally goes down meaning more time. If there is rain here schools are let out, work comes to a halt, you literally get emergency notifications on your phone as well. Also, thank you for the reply!
