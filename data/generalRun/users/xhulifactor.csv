transformers,fg5rf7m,t3_ewwawf,1580536114.0,"I always assumed that they used energon as food  but could augment their bodies with technology which would then need to be powered either by linking into their energon system or through external power pack.  So bumblebee could use his energon to power his plasma cannon in a pinch but also had a power pack slot for heavy combat.  Likewise a railgun  arm/ shoulder mount would need power and ammo.  

Note this is pretty much head canon but honestly TF canon is like any other comic book canon: a rorschach blot of word/ fact vomit pinned in place by one or two general basics.  ""Depends  on the writer"" is the kindest way to describe it."
