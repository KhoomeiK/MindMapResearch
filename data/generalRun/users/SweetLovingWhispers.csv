Oh, and just in case you are in the mood for a great love story where they do not end up together, but the anime is just to good to skip I recommended Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun."
anime,fffo674,t3_etd438,1579888166.0,"There are a few I can think of, first would be a beautiful and pure anime called Kimi Ni Todoke. Another pure but more of a rom com is My Love Story!!. Oh, a classic pure love story Ai Yori Aoshi. If you want a more serious love story you can try My Little Monster. Or maybe you want more cliche then try Ao Haru Ride. A few more that are good love animes but may not seen like it at first: Say ""I Love You""., Maid Sama!, Kamisama Kiss, Kakuriyo: Bed & Breakfast for Spirits, and Wise Man's Grandchild. I am pretty sure all of them end up together, but I may be forgetting some of the details or getting some mixed up. Hard to remember each one in full detail. Either way good luck finding some great anime!"
