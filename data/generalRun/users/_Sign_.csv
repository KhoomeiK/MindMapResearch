DallasFuel,fdspia8,t1_fdrldjj,1578706268.0,"QoQ is a REALLY good off-tank (previously on runaway) who's currently FA. gamsu/note is worth betting on though. i think NotE can do great things if given some time on a functional team

for support, theres bdosin, whos still FA, but outside of bdosin, theres not many great *proven* off-supports available. dallas would need to take a chance on a player and hope they work out

if i had the choice, id definitely pick up a flex-support first, preferably bdosin, and assure a top 10 spot. id also look into someone like fielder from gc busan wave. he's looked good from a surface level but its hard to analyze with the terrible camera work. imo, Closer is a very good main support and doesnt need replacing and NotE deserves a second chance to prove himself"
