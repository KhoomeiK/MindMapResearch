I have a short, guttural, Eastern European last name.  My wife's first name is very long, and she was adamant that we weren't going to hang 4 syllables on a kid.  I wanted my kids to both have 2 syllable first names to soften up the last name, and I wanted names that couldn't be easily nicknamed shorter than 2 syllables.

We wanted names that were somewhat traditional, but also somewhat uncommon.

I also had a hard pass on any name ending with any variety of -son or -en.  Jackson, Grayson, Mason, Madison, Aiden, Kayden, Raiden, Jayden.  No. way.

We named our older kid Eli.  At the time, the name wasn't anywhere on the list, and I'd never met an Eli in my life.  Now, he has like 5 Elis in his class, and he's never played on a sports team without another Eli.  Apparently everyone was naming their boys Eli that year.

They're not especially fun to work on, the gas mileage isn't great, and they're not especially reliable in my experience.  That said, I like the current WRX.  I'm not in love with it, but it checked all of my boxes.  

The GTI was an afterthought.  I wasn't considering one, or even planning to test drive one.  My list was 1. WRX, 2. Civic Si, 3. Accord 2.0T 6MT.  My requirements was that the car had to be 4-door, manual, engaging to drive, over 200HP, and under $30K.  This was replacing a heavily modded Civic that I'd owned for 18 years and 320K miles, and had done a TON of work to.  I had planned to drive those three and buy my favorite.

So, couldn't find a WRX anywhere, and I was having trouble finding Si's and 2.0T Accords with the stick.  When I did find an Accord, I liked it, but it was at the very top of my price range (a little over, actually).

The ONLY reason I drove a GTI was because the Subaru dealer sold the WRX that I was coming to look at, and the VW dealer was right down the street.  They were closing in an hour, so I figured I'd pop in.  I wasn't expecting to like the GTI as much as I did.


The current Civic Si is an amazing car if you can get past the looks, but it still wasn't as good as the '19 GTI.  The Volkswagen is just better all around.  It's quicker, sounds better, has better ergonomics, looks better, and quite honestly, I think is better in the twisties...  Which is the main reason that I buy cars like this."

I'd head from St. Louis over the Rockies into the desert southwest, down through Arizona and New Mexico into Mexico, into the spring.  Then across the south, up the Appalachians to Maine into summer.  I believe there's a ferry somewhere up there that'll take you to Nova Scotia.  I'd explore the maritime provinces (I've always wanted to see Prince Edward Island), then across Canada into Alaska and up to Prudhoe Bay.  From there, down to Anchorage, take the ferry to Vancouver, into Washington State, and drive down the coast all the way to San Diego.  Wherever I felt like it, I'd stop.  If I wanted to stay 3-4 days somewhere and see sights, I'd do it.  I'd hit all of the art and history museums that I think are cool, but can't ever get anyone to go with.

AskReddit,ffce8lz,t1_ffc4cck,1579797568.0,"Fostering is fairly easy to get into in my state, but it's definitely not for everybody.


I know two couples who foster, and they just had to fill out a few forms, meet the requirements, and pass a background check.  It took about a month to process their application.  Two weeks after that, they had a 2am call to come pick up a toddler.  I was shocked at how quick it happened.  It seems almost like you just sign a paper and they start handing you kids.

Right now, both couples are fostering three kids each.  They're all good kids, but there are definitely some emotional and behavioral issues.  They can be a bit hard to deal with.  One of the kids, a second grader, seems obsessed with violence and death.  I mean, I have little boys, I know they're all slightly obsessed with violence and killing, but this kid draws pictures and says things that are downright scary.  He hasn't done anything that we know of, but we're afraid he's going down a dark road.

Another one of the kids, a third grade boy, is super nice and bright, but has gone through some terrible situations, and has been basically raised by his older siblings.  He has no concept of things like eating right, washing, homework, or bedtime, and lashes out at his foster parents for trying to make him do those things.  Fostering is doing wonders for him though; he's gone from a basically illiterate third grader to 80th percentile in like six months.


In 100% of the cases I know, these kids are in foster care because of either Meth or opiates on the parts of their parents.  All six of them.  Every one of these kids has grown up seeing adults being shitty.

These poor foster parents ask my wife and me for advice because we have kids their ages, but the problems that they're having are nowhere in our experience.  My wife and I joke that our kids are monsters, but they're relatively normal, and their behavior issues are not even on the same planet as these poor foster kids.  We give the best advice we can.

They punch in a description of your car (black Subaru, for mine).  It was January, and they even had infrared heaters overhead for the workers.

I swear, people were barely having to slow down to get their orders taken.  Bags were flying out the window into cars as fast as they could pull up.  It was absolutely in-fucking-sane.

I like to give new listeners the keystone albums, and then tell them to pick the one they like the best, and then listen to the albums before and after that one.  I think moving through them in this way is a good way to introduce new listeners to Rush without getting them overwhelmed.


So, Moving Pictures is a Keystone - albums before and after are Signals and Permanent Waves.  All are awesome, and all sort of fit together stylistically.  

Other Keystones, in my opinion:

Power Windows (Synth era - Grace Under Pressure and Hold Your Fire.  I personally think P/G is the best synth album, but it works nicely this way.)

Farewell to Kings (Prog era - 2112 and Hemispheres)

Vapor Trails (Modern Rock era - Counterparts and Snakes and Arrows)

Obviously some gaps - Test for Echo also fits in the Modern Rock era.  Roll the Bones and Presto are transitional albums that kinda bridge between the synth and Modern eras.  Caress of Steel is firmly in the Prog era.

After the tragic and unexpected deaths of his daughter and wife within a few months of each other, he completely dropped out of life for a couple of years, and just rode his motorcycle all over North America, from Ontario, to Prudhoe Bay, to Belize, trying to overcome his grief.  The book is about that, and it's good, but it's absolutely heart wrenching.

I'm also a fan of 'Far and Wide', and 'Traveling Music.'  Both are interesting and conversational, albeit not quite as good as 'Ghost Rider.'  Both lack the massive gutpunch that is 'Ghost Rider,' which is honestly a bit hard to read at points because of the sheer level of grief.  I forget which, but I think one of them talks about riding across Africa.


There's also a Rush song about it, if you're interested: ['Ghost Rider'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X8b8C6OpZg)"
GoldandBlack,fdzjr50,t1_fdweuhq,1578790867.0,"I'm a massive Rush fan, and I've read a few of his books.


I'm convinced that he never actually became any kind of a lefty; he just got tired of answering stupid questions and accusations of being a fascist.  He's an intensely private person, and never intended to be anything like a 'voice of a generation'.  He just wanted to write lyrics that were true to him.  When people who didn't understand libertarian philosophy tried to read things into them that weren't there (fascism, for example), he tempered his public declarations because he didn't want to be labeled as something he wasn't.  But he didn't really change his lyrics.  He never did.

He never stopped writing libertarian lyrics.  His books certainly don't seem like he was a leftist.  He just stopped being blatantly outspoken about being an Objectivist because of the backlash.  He certainly mellowed out his views a bit, but he never wavered on themes of personal freedom and personal responsibility.

Example:  'Freewill' was written after they started to publicly disavow Rand.  Freewill is an absolutely Objectivist document from start to finish.  Seriously, fucking listen to Freewill, and tell me that it's not 100% Randian, through and through.  Rush publicly disavowed Ayn Rand, and then Neil followed up by writing a song that was a tribute to Objectivism.  Neil, as I recall, merely said that his beliefs had matured.  That doesn't mean they're no longer valid.

More libertarian examples from Rush's post-Rand career: Tom Sawyer (his mind is not for rent to any god or government), Red Barchetta (anti-government authority), Losing It (aesthetics, 'The Fountainhead'), Red Sector A (anti-fascism), The Body Electric (individual autonomy), Marathon (individual perseverance), Middletown Dreams (fighting for your dreams), Force Ten (A=A, basic tenants of Objectivism), Mission (Man's achievement), Show Don't Tell (A=A), Nobody's Hero (idolize those who do truly great things) Bravado (SERIOUSLY LISTEN TO THIS ONE... doing your best ALWAYS despite KNOWING that you're going to fail, because your best is all you have.  THIS ONE is Ayn Rand all the way), One Little Victory (personal achievement), How It Is (persevering through personal difficulty), Armor and Sword (overcome personal fears and limitations to achieve your best), BU2B (the notion that the nature of the universe is knowable to us), The Garden (the measure of a man is respect).

Obviously I don't know this for sure, but that's my conclusion based on what I've observed in his art.  He maintained principals of personal liberty and autonomy to his death, despite claims to the contrary.  He's maybe a Howard Roark Objectivist more than a Dagny Taggart Objectivist....  Or maybe he's more of a Fransisco D'anconia Objectivist, who was faking through half of his career."

Like you, my gateway into synth-era Rush was Time Stand Still.  I was showing the video to my wife so she could see how cheesy it was.  Somewhere about 1/3 of the way through, I remember thinking 'hey, this song actually isn't half bad.'  By the end, I loved it.  'Time Stand Still' is lyrically perfect.  It's musically perfect.  It's an absolutely perfect song.


I didn't get into other synth-era Rush right away.  For those, the gateway was the 'Different Strings' live album.  In the live album, the synth songs all have a touch more bite to them, and I grew to love them.  Eventually, I went back to the studio albums.

For me, the origin of my problems is easy to pinpoint.  I was a happy, social, and popular third grade kid with barely a care in the world.  My family moved to a different country halfway through 4th grade.  I went to three different schools that year and had no friends.  I had no experience making friends because I'd never had to before.  I overcompensated, and was bullied.  Teachers cut me no slack for gaps in my knowledge caused by moving in the school year.  I had previously been one of the smartest kids in my grade, and so I had no idea of how to ask for academic help.  My grades got bad, and my parents cut me no slack because I didn't know how to tell them I didn't understand things.

4th grade was the first time that I remember wanting to die, and it only got worse from there.

I was teased mercilessly, and bullied constantly.  They would follow me home every day and beat on me the entire way.  I hated my life and wanted it to end.

Then, in 7th grade,  I got to do it all again!  We moved back to the states.  Between 6th grade and high school, I went to five different schools.  I began to seriously consider suicide.  In eighth grade, I fell in with a bad crowd because we had moved to a VERY small and insular town... my 8th grade had 30 kids in it, and they all already had friend groups.  The 'bad' kids were the only ones who accepted me, so that's who I hung with, and I got into trouble.  I started self harm in high school.  I was vandalizing stuff... Just a terrible kid, and I felt like it.  In college, I began to make actual plans to end my life, when my depression suddenly lifted due to factors that I still don't understand.

I could go on and on, but my suicidal ideation started in 4th grade, and I hear that from so many other people.  I'm not sure why it's such a common age.  My depression didn't end until my early 20s, and to this day, I'm not sure why my depression ended.  It was only then, outside depression, that I was able to take a hard look at my life and realize that so much of my self loathing had roots in circumstances outside of my control.  I had been hating myself for years, for reasons having nothing to do with me.

The thought of sad kids is so sad to me.  My older son is 9 now, and he's exactly the sort of kid that I was.  He's very popular, and social, and has lots of good friends and hobbies, but I can tell that he's the type to hold his cards close to his vest.  I can see that he wears a facade to keep people from knowing what he's truly thinking.  I can see already that if he's struggling, he's going to do it in silence, and it scares the hell out of me.  I love him to death, and I don't want him to go through what I did.

They get more free sunpower than they need, so who cares if it's efficient.  Interesting thought...

Conveniently, most DC Integra suspension parts bolt right into an EG with no modification, so 5-lug on an EG can be as easy as swapping in ITR knuckles and trailing arms... presuming you can find them for any kind of reasonable price.

EJ stuff was all totally different, and front suspension stuff isn't easily interchangeable with EG/DC, with the exception of some swaybar and brake components.  I believe you can 5-lug swap an EJ by pressing ITR bearings into EJ knuckles.  But, there's no great performance reason to do it other than to either flex or run ITR wheels (and flex).


Fun fact:  This is still one of the quickest and best ways (other than checking the VIN) to determine if an Integra is a true ITR or a clone.  If it's 4-lug, it's almost definitely a clone.  If it's 5-lug, it could still be a clone, but it's less likely.  It's pretty uncommon to go to the trouble and expense of a 5-lug conversion for no real performance benefit.

You run the risk of the house falling in on you, but if a tornado is strong enough that it razes the house and throws it into the basement, then survival is going to be a complete crapshoot no matter where you are.  Illinois is a bit odd in that we have a fair amount of tornadoes, but few really strong ones.  Ours are typically later in the season - Oklahoma's strongest tend to be in mid spring to early summer.  Illinois's tend to be mid summer into the fall, and even December tornadoes happen.  [We're occasionally prone to outbreaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_1957_tornado_outbreak_sequence).  Illinois is also home to the [deadliest tornado in U.S. history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-State_Tornado).


Frequency patterns all have to do with where cold dry air coming from the west or northwest mixes with warm moist air coming up from the Gulf of Mexico.  Tornado alley tends to move west to east from spring to winter, although they can really happen anywhere conditions are perfect.

As a former member, UFCW is a garbage union for grocery workers.  I got the privilege of giving them 10% of my pay in dues so I could bring home $400/month, and so my employer could advertise that they were a ""union shop"".  The employer got all of the benefits out of the union arrangement, while the employees got literally nothing, and had to pay for it.

Eventually, I got fed up and went down the street to a non-union gas station job for a buck more an hour and better benefits.  They occasionally made me do things that would have never happened in the union shop (I was once asked to work a 24-hour shift), but they paid good overtime, gave better raises, advancement opportunities and PTO, and generally treated me better.


The union did fight for me in one specific instance where the boss decreed that no one was allowed to leave the property during their shift, even if they were off the clock, and also that no one was allowed to smoke on company property.  This meant that we couldn't leave even when clocked out for lunch, and no one could smoke, since no one could smoke on property, and no one could leave.  All lunch had to be bought at the grocery store, and no one could take care of personal business, even if you were off the clock.  It was the one and only time I called the union, and they had a rep out by lunchtime who fixed that particular situation. 


But then again, no non-union job has ever tried anything so ridiculous on me in the first place.  The boss was PISSED at me for reporting him, and ultimately, the subtle retaliation over it played a part in my leaving.

explainlikeimfive,fcyj8mp,t1_fcxygsw,1578080995.0,"Man, I really wish I had this experience.


When my back pain flares up, 800/400 of Ibuprofen and Paracetamol doesn't even touch it.  I mean, NOTHING.  I might as well have not taken anything.  I just have to live with it.  Thankfully it comes and goes, and it hasn't been bothering me for a while.  Completely pain free today.  Last week I slept wrong, and was in about constant 5/10 pain all week.  Before that, no pain for 8 months or so.



The last time I full-on threw my back out (which is about a 9/10 on my personal pain scale), I took 800/400 every 4 hours and alternated hot/cold on a foam roller.  Nothing.  All I could do was lay flat on my back, so I went to bed with my legs elevated and a hot water bottle at my back.


The next morning, pain hadn't gone anywhere.  I had to play (music) that morning, so I took another 800/400, added 2 Vicodin leftover from my wisdom tooth removal, and then threw on a Flexerol muscle relaxer from previous back problems.  That enabled me to get out of bed and get to church, where I played Sunday service, sitting in a chair, high as a bloody kite.  The pain was so bad, even after the meds, that I could barely stand or walk at all, and had to be helped on/off stage.


So, I take Motrin/Tylenol because people tell me that it should work, but in my experience, it does absolutely nothing for me.  I REALLY wish I could come up with something, because it's agony for sometimes 4-5 days, followed by a dull ache for weeks after.  Vicodin doesn't seem to do anything.  If I get REALLY drunk it helps, but I can't live like that, and I won't take anything but Ibuprofen if I'm drinking.  Flexerol is the only thing that seems to help at all, but it turns me into quivering jelly, and I'm not at all functional when I'm on it."

worldnews,fcxve19,t1_fcxei0g,1578071030.0,"He's obviously unfit for the presidency, and the Democrats are dangerously underestimating his re-election chances.


Everything that makes him unfit makes him popular to the types of people who would vote for him.  Impeachment is playing right into his hands.  The prospect of a war with Iran is exactly what he wants for a re-election campaign.


I predicted in December 2014 that if the two candidates ended up being Trump and Clinton, that he would win, because that would show that the Democrats underestimated him by running literally the most unelectable woman in the country against him.  He won.


I've successfully predicted every presidential election since 2000.  Sadly, it's not very hard.  Think of your average Wal-Mart American.  Ask yourself which candidate that person would rather sit at the bar and have a beer with.  Your answer is who will win the election.  Every. Year.  We live in a country where the next president can RELIABLY be predicted by who sells more Halloween masks in the October preceding the election.  The US Presidential election isn't about platform, it's about name recognition to the politically ignorant.  So:  Who will sell more masks?  Reagan or Mondale?  Bush or Dukakis?  Clinton or Bush?  Obama or Dole?  Obama or Romney?  Trump?  Or Biden?


Biden ain't gonna beat him.  He doesn't have the charisma to draw the politically illiterate.  He doesn't even inspire enthusiasm in his own base... how can they expect him to draw in the politically illiterate independents that they'll need to win?


No, they need someone charismatic.  They need someone who can out-charisma Trump, with big ideas, and I don't know who that'll be... to my eyes, they don't have anybody.  Maybe Bernie, but he's really getting too old.  I've said it before; I honestly think AOC would be the perfect candidate if she had a bit more political experience.  She's young, pretty, has grand ideas, and pisses off the right in the exact same way that Trump pisses off the left.  If she can generate a sassy Marissa Tomei New York accent, she'd wipe the floor with him in a general election.  Alas, there's no chance in hell she'll get the nomination this time.


In any case, hunker down.  Unless the Dems figure something out, I'll almost guarantee four more years of Trump.  Their best hope as I see it is to try to stack the Senate for impeachment, which, if successful, results in... .... President Pence!  What a lovely world that'll be! /s

cars,fcxgdcl,t1_fcxfh0a,1578062231.0,"Illinois titled my '99 Impreza Outback Sport as a ""carryall"".


From what I can tell, Illinois uses ""carryall"" in the same context as ""catchall"".  It's like the automotive equivalent of a junk drawer, where they put stuff that doesn't have a place.  

I guess it means some sort of wagonish-type thing, maybe, but not very consistently.  So far, Illinois has classed my Outback, '94 Cherokee, '99 Honda CRV, and '14 Kia Soul as a ""carryall"".  


My '19 Golf GTI is classified as a ""passenger car"", despite being functionally identical to my Kia Soul in terms of doors, passengers, driven wheels, number of windows, and cargo capacity.  It's also slightly bigger than my '99 Outback was, and just as tall, with about the same cargo capacity, yet it's NOT a carryall.  My '02 Silverado is obviously a ""pickup"".  To further muddy the waters, my buddy's AWD b4 Audi Allroad wagon is a ""passenger car.""


So, SUV = carryall.  Small 5-door hatch with AWD = Carryall.  Tall hatchback without AWD = carryall.  Small 5-door hatchback without AWD = passenger car.  Audi Allroad = somehow, passenger car.  A wagon is a carryall, except when it's not.  A hatchback is a carryall, except when it's not.


At first, I thought that anything with a window behind the C-pillar was a carryall, but if that was the case, my Soul wouldn't be, but the Allroad would be.  So then, I thought it might be any 5-door with a window behind the C-pillar and AWD, but again, then the Allroad would be.  I cannot fathom how the Soul is a ""carryall"", and so is an Impreza Outback, but an Audi Allroad is not.


To make it even weirder, Illinois will let you put truck plates on a carryall and car plates on a pickup.  So, my Kia Soul and Outback could have truck plates, and my Silverado could have car plates, but the Allroad and GTI REQUIRE car plates, and can NOT have truck plates.
