Are you some kind of root-canal lobbyist or something?"
Futurology,ffsyv7a,t1_ffsg3py,1580198324.0,"Man in the high castle was great; you just have to omit the last 2-5 minutes of the series: Homeboy pulls the trigger, Juliana calls it in, and the remaining powers-that-be take their resulting actions/inaction. (Trying to be a little vague to obfuscate spoilers)

And that’s it. The series is over. No meaningless, overly-stylized bullshit happening here. Nope. That’s a wrap."
aww,ffsn4yq,t1_ffsfiy1,1580185983.0,Is Vermin Supreme running again this year? That guy’s wholesome af (not just saying it cuz I want a free pony)

*Balance is a really important thing in most if not all aspects of life/nature, and overfishing is a serious issue contributing to mass extinction*

And I just re-read your comment and realized I misread the bit about numbers and that I’m creating conflict out of nowhere ... I should go do some yoga or something and balance my attitude ...

(PS - nice name)"
PublicFreakout,ffrdoix,t1_ffra5e0,1580155951.0,"Is “balanced highs” a roller coaster design term, a game design term, a weed term, an insurance term, or something else?"
Tinder,ffnn634,t1_ffg5ivm,1580068092.0,"So a self-deprecating joke can be perceived as confident and owning a flaw, or it can be seen as self-conscious and trying to “use a move.” The prior can be attractive, but it’s subject to the woman perceiving it which way it comes off. 

Gotta say, as a dude, one of the most frustrating things about dating is the importance women (or more accurately, the parts of the media that make their money “influencing” dating trends) place on confidence. 

It’s almost impossible to exude/emulate if you’re feeling even a little bit of self-doubt, and - you learn this very clearly as a man spending any amount of time around other men - most confidence is unwarranted. More often than not, a guy who’s really confident is just too stupid or naive to be self-aware.

Then again, I suppose if the roles are switched, the upper echelon of guys (the ones who have their pick of mates) tend to go for pretty women who are kinda dumb. I guess it’s actually more or less the same thing."
entertainment,ffkvvcs,t1_ffiqn9b,1580029938.0,Is the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia still Twitter’s second latest shareholder? Is that common knowledge yet?
entertainment,ffku6vo,t1_ffjgz3a,1580028962.0,"No.

1. Reddit doesn’t have a unified voice

2. The media doesn’t talk about our unified voice (that we don’t have) like it’s news

3. “What’s wrong with being black; are you racist?” -We here at the WaPo asked Twitter what they thought of u/mathewkorbin’s above comment about pot/kettles/blackness, this was their response-"
OldSchoolCool,ffkr77e,t1_ffk3wgg,1580027454.0,"I also misread this as “furries” at first ... but like ... if your team was all furries ...

Regular teams’ mascots are basically just sexless furries, right?

So like would Team Furry’s mascot just be like a regular dude?"

mildlyinteresting,ffftq37,t1_fffozw8,1579891593.0,"I think it could be in another context. To a stranger on the Internet, it might still be funny if it happened once.

AskReddit,ffcqjo8,t1_ffcpbrb,1579805146.0,"It’s been a couple decades since I read the books, but IIRC, the supercomputer answers “what is the meaning of the life, universe, and everything?” with “42.”

Then everybody’s like “maybe we asked the question wrong?” and finding the right question is like an ongoing sub-plot in the second or third book. I think I recall Arthur saying something along the lines of “maybe it’s how many paths you have to go down in life?”"
