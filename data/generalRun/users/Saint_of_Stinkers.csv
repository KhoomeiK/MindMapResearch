I suffered for most of my life with terrible indigestion. I was addicted to Tums. Reently I had a medical intervention that was acid reflux based: excess stomach acid had damaged my esophagus, causing me to choke on food. I had swallowed a bit of beef that would not go down, and was just stuck thee. I felt fine, but could neither eat nor drink . If I had not one to a hospital I would have died of thirst. 

The doctors gave me some medical strength antacids, like Zantac, for two months. For the first time in I dont know how longI could eat food like a normal person without undue suffering. After the two month course of treatment was at an end I was able to both chew and swallow meat without forcing or suffering. That lasted for a few months.

The symtoms reasserted and I started takiing OTC acid reducers. And I was good! I stuffed myself with chicken wings,i pizza and beer without a thought for the future. Then I ran out, and went to the drug store to re-up. And thee was no Zantac to be had! There hadf been some sort of problem with the company that made it and it had been recalled. So I tried this other product,i Prilosec I thinik. You can only takie it for two weeks,  which is what I did. When the two weekis was over,i I suffered a rebound. It was the worst pain ever. There had to be another w2ay.

So I started having a salad every day. And I have never tfelt better! Turns out the problem, was my diet."

AskReddit,ffax9rl,t3_esdjti,1579746623.0,"Over the weekend I went tob see ""Little Women"", at the insistence of my girlfriend. I made it twenty minutes in before I had to bail. That was the only movie that I have ever seen that made me want to punch it in the nose. I mean I was fuming! First, my GF told me that I would love it, and it was just the right flic for me. How could she not get me so badly? Second,  I am pretty sure that I was the only human in the audience with a Y chromosone. That movie was for women and their impressionable daughters. There were a lot of females there that fit that description. And finally, that film was nothing but a historical fantasy about the Victorian era taht had little to do with reality, and was targetted to afluent white women.

How could my GF not understand that if a movie does not have a gun in it or something blowing up every fifteen minutes that it is not for me?"

canada,fel7994,t3_epn9wj,1579215572.0,"The government is just shooting itself in the foot by selling weak overpriced edibles. It is just so easy to make your own that there is little incentive to order theirs. Particularly if you, like me, need a minimum of 100mg to feel anything. Here are two very easy ways to make ediblesL:

1) You can simply grind up some raw bud and bake a cookie with a spoonful of cake mix. Nothing to it.

2) You can put some ground up weed into a small container witha bit of butter and some water, cover it with foil and simmer it over night on a coffee cup warmer. In the morning you drain it through some cheesecloth and put the liquid into a fridge to cool until the butter floats to the surface and solidifies. Then use the weed butter in any way you want.

Thats it. Do it this way and you will get edibles cheaper and more powerful than anything the government wants to sell you. Also, if you can stand the taste of the weed cookie the buzz is much better and lasts longer.

I hope someone in charge reads this and realizes that they need to step up their game. Or as someone else once said"" do you want to increase the black market for edibles by selling such unrealistic small doses? Because thats how you increase the black market. By selling weak overpriced edibles."

I was hiking in rural Qubec. I was out in the middle of where the hell am I?, trying to find a road back to civilization. I came out on a dirt road that looked like it saw a car infrequently. I looked right and left, and saw nothing but trees and bugs. Mentally flipping a coin,  I headed in one direction and prayed for luck. Not far down the road I came upon a gas station. Entering said establishment, and feeling the need for a little pick me up, I enquired in my limited French if there was food to be had. They had food.
