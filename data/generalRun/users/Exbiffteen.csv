JusticeServed,ffhqufo,t1_ffhqmse,1579949058.0,"Hard to say. Your odds of getting a deal depend on where you’re at in, at least from experience in the US. Rural courts are more likely to go to trial due to a lower case load where suburban/urban courts are more likely to plea.

But also depends on how well the report is written and if you can articulate what happened. My guess because all you had was him “throwing himself” on the car would be MDOP. And not even that of a police vehicle because this appears to be a UC ride and they clearly didn’t know it was a cop lol."

ExtremeCarCrashes,ffb1c7o,t1_ff9loo8,1579749344.0,Maybe. Might just have the pancake effect
ExtremeCarCrashes,ffb19lo,t1_ff9qyy8,1579749297.0,"Hard to say. I’ve seen a fatal accident where a kid going 65 in a 45 slammed into the side of a semi pulling out of a parking lot. Half a second before he hit the truck you saw his tail lights come on. Kid was on snap chat. Truck was initially at fault, but the math proved that had the kid been paying attention and even hit the breaks (I think) 4 seconds before the crash he would have survived. Keep in mind he hit the middle of the trailer, and when the semi began pulling out the kid was between 1/2-1/4 mile away. Plenty of time to see the truck and stop. 

Moral of the story, don’t fuck around on your phone. Or if you do for some reason, don’t look away for more than a few seconds."

So yes, climate change is happening, but itâ€™s going to happen regardless of what we do. Could we slow it down by a few thousand years, sure. But in the end itâ€™s still gonna happen, and weâ€™re talking 10â€™s of thousands of years. And honestly weâ€™ll be lucky if humanity hasnâ€™t obliterated itself by that point."

therewasanattempt,fd9tjrs,t1_fd7vjn2,1578237882.0,"Iâ€™m an officer and I call bullshit on that â€œexpert training/prior experienceâ€ shit.  

My department field tests anything that could possibly be an illicit drug, and yes they can show a false positive, I havenâ€™t found that to be common if done correctly. And there are only a handful of people allowed to conduct those tests, not every officer is allowed, which reduces the odds of a fuck up. 

Iâ€™ve had what looked like road salt, and completely thought it was and ended up being crack, experience is only good to a point. 

At the same time, they didnâ€™t necessarily do anything wrong by arresting him if the test showed a false positive, because it wasnâ€™t necessarily their fault. They are called presumptive tests for a reason. The problem in my opinion is his employer that shit canned him on the spot. Itâ€™s innocent until proven guilty, and mistakes do happen. Might be hard for some to understand but officers arenâ€™t perfect and only a small few have the justice stick so far up their ass they fudge the truth."
