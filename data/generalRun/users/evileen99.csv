AmItheAsshole,ff8zbud,t3_esbm63,1579700795.0,"NTA.  I had an 18 year old stepson that didn't want to be responsible for getting himself up for school.  My husband said waking him up every day would teach him to get up on time.  I said that would teach him that someone else is responsible for his punctuality.  I asked my husband if he was going to call him every day when he was in college to make sure he got to class, and then when he got a job, call him every day to make sure he got to work.  I said this is a life skill, not a punishment.

We proposed several ideas to make him get himself up, but he shot them all down with ridiculous reasons.  I ended the conversation by saying ""Okay, then you need to come up with a plan on your own because I am NOT getting you up for school.""

The next day he overslept, was late (and really pissed off) and got detention.  This went on for a week and he said out of frustration ""Do you WANT me to get detention?"" (like him being in detention somehow hurt me).  I said ""Yes I do.  So if YOU don't want to be in detention, you need to figure something out.""  He then figured something out."

fatlogic,ff8ugvy,t1_ff8hqu3,1579696494.0,"This.  Back in the early '90's, I used to work for a big, well-known teaching hospital that was always advertising for research subjects.  One day there was a flyer up that said a group was studying obesity and was paying $10 for a blood draw and weight.  Sign me up!  About a dozen of my coworkers and I went over and had it done.  

I kept getting called back for more studies, and none of my coworkers did.  After about the fourth one, I asked why I was getting so many offers and none of my friends were.  The answer? ""You're a normal weight but have the hormone profile of an obese person, and we're looking in to what might make you a normal size and others like you not.""  I answered ""I count calories and exercise.""

Didn't stop them from using me, as there were still other things they wanted to look at with obesity and not many people would do all day studies, overnight studies,or let them place 3 IVs."
