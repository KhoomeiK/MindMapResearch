entitledparents,ffj9opr,t3_etqjrf,1579993711.0,"Ok, so I’ve spent a fair stint working in audiology and what doesn’t ring true for me is that the hearing aids were implanted. Yes, this is possible (such as the Phonak Lyric), but they are surgically inserted into the canal, not visible (unless you’re looking deep into the ear) and certainly not able to be ripped out by a brat. They remain for 3 months and are then replaced. This makes them an expensive option and would not be recommended for a child, especially as a first time user.

The other “implant” option is the cochlear, which is large and cumbersome, and again, not going to be confused with AirPods.

Hearing aids these days are tiny, but they still look like hearing aids and wouldn’t cause bleeding if removed, even clumsily.

The only product I can possibly think of that is even remotely similar would be hearables such as Nuheara IQ buds. These aren’t a hearing aid per se, but an assistive device which is primarily controlled by the wearer rather than an audiologist.
