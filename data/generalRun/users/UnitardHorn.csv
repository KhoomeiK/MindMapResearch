london,fflperg,t1_ffkz2ie,1580042422.0,"No I totally get the difference. It’s just 10 years ago, if anyone described a recording as binaural they would have been carted off by the unnecessarily obscure word police. Now the words literally everywhere (or maybe that’s just confirmation bias)."
london,ffky8pr,t3_etx1cg,1580031184.0,When did we as a people start saying binaural instead of stereo?
lifehacks,ff3y07d,t1_ff3u4ll,1579551318.0,"This is like ordering the 12 slice large pizza, getting half of it and then watching them cut each of your six slices in half and saying “see, same diameter and same number of slices. Same size pizza..."
facepalm,ff3x2s3,t1_ff3tzpf,1579550740.0,"And I guess that’s what we’ve tended to do in the general school system which is why in most people’s minds it feels wrong. Like I said, I didn’t actually find this out until university, in my general state school education they were always treated as separate examples of imagery.    Also, our language is kind of effed up anyway.... Like how the word “literally” is now it’s own antonym. If you look up “Literally” in the OED one of its definitions is “figuratively” because so many people say stuff like “ohmagawwwwd I’m literally dying right now!”"
facepalm,ff3jnxi,t1_ff26hde,1579542475.0,"If I can use an analogy, the term ""cat"" refers both to felids in general and specifically to the domestic cat (Felis catus).  

The word metaphor has always been used to mean  figurative rhetoric in culture (this why people will say [a film is a metaphor](https://www.vulture.com/2017/09/darren-aronofsky-talks-the-metaphors-of-mother.html)  despite it being allegorical rather than metaphorical) 

I think the big point is that metaphor has the specific meaning most people are taught in secondary education/high school and the wider meaning when we speak about “use of” metaphor in language and culture in which case it generally just means figurative language."

facepalm,fezryd9,t1_fey29ya,1579460879.0,"In internet rooms and computer mainframes
There's loads of emails but your mother's blue veins.
Not the ones in her legs or the backs of her arms
But the ones in her member hidden in her gown.
She walks around proud, with a short dress on
Which sometimes exposes the tip of her dong.
Often it's dripping, sometimes it's dry
No matter when I see her there's a tear in my eye."
