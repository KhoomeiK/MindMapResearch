Again, WTF are you talking about? Your obviously referring to Joe's kid but completely excluding the main reason it was valid. His kid was involved incorruption and if you only have a handful of citizens/appointed citizens you need to get help from the local government. This is what happened and there is zero first hand proof showing otherwise. Exactly why this trial was a joke and waste of time. You can't convict someone on circumstancial evidence but that's all the house had and decided to move forward. Purely a joke and never would have made it to trial if in a standard court (not to mention a United democratic party hail merry to save their next election chances). Don't even try to tell me the 1-2 voting against it weren't given prior approval. It was planned based on reflection needs. 

>>I believe Article II of the Constitution gives the president the right to do whatever he wants.

Your not looking at this clearly. As I've said the president has the right and power to ask foreign governments to investigate corruption and that's all that happened. There is zero proof it was related to the election and purely made up by dems"

Conservative,fgdi1an,t1_fg7r0u0,1580682667.0,"Because Bernie is a death sentence to the democratic party. That's not even considering the fact he's going against Trump who makes it even more ridiculous. Sure you have a ton of social media support but how many are legal voters? On top of that how many have a 401k or roth? On top of that howany Democrats have investments and want to protect them? If Bernie gets the nomination his only, and I mean only, hope is hundreds to thousands of voters who have never voted before show up (and exclude those who aren't legally allowed to vote). It simply won't happen because even Democrats look at their investments/401k and if you have one of those you already know Bernie is going to take it away or means test. Anyone with a 401k is scared of his policies and will flip parties immediately, is it not clear why the democratic party refuses to let him win the nomination? He works on social media and his ideas work only in an online fantasy but simply don't work in the real world. For example there are rich Democrats and if you think they will vote for Bernie your lying to yourself. He appeals to young, fresh out of collage kids who haven't paid a 30-45% income tax on top of standard income tax. We'll see what happens but if the democratic party goes socialist as in Bernie or 1/2 other candidates just watch old traditional Democrats vote for Trump. You can hate it love him but anyone with a 401k or other investments will do anything and everything to keep someone like Bernie out. They may support their ideals and etc but they also worked to get their money and are not going to let someone like Bernie redistribute it while he sits exempt. And please tell me you already know Congress and senante are excluded from many of the laws a general citizen has to follow. For one, insider trading is completely legal for them. Ever wonder why they take a job paying less than they made at the former job or why they somehow leave a public service job and have 10* more than the legal salary? Meanwhile Bernie wants the shove some BS healthcare down our throats while he gets his own lifetime free healthcare from his elected position. I'm all for universal healthcare but the only way I can trust it's done correctly is if the elected officials who run/create it are on the same plan. My brain just about explodes when I hear people say it's ok for their elected official to vote on life and death healthcare decisions when they have their own plan and have zero consequences to the decisions made.
