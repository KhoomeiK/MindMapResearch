you seem to think professional fields of knowledge can just change the commonly used definition of a word like they're no more that a wikipedia page of bullshit. I am not commenting on the validity of your ideas, but the way which you convey them and how you define yourself to be right while blinding yourself from reality.

&#x200B;

As someone studying chemistry, I know the scientific definition of 'organic.' Poisons can be organic, pesticides can be organic, carcinogens, corrosives, and all around general terrible shit can be organic. Does that mean that people that refer to apples made without pesticides and manmade chemicals as organic are wrong? No, theres 2 definitions of the word.

&#x200B;

So if my friend says ""hey are those apples organic"" and giggle to myself and say ""yeah bro, totally organic"" I am right by the scientific definition, but I am actually wrong. I am actually being an ass. I could go on about how ""nah bro glyphosphate is totally an organic molecule, you just don't understand cause you don't know science,"" but that doesn't make me right.
