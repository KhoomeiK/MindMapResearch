Hell I'd even accept the Reapers. They come from outside the Galaxy. It would kind of hilarious if they did all of that, and the Reapers either followed them to Andromeda or they realize they've always been there. 

Actually, having some of the Reapers follow them would make for a good story. The new humans who have helped with Meridian, pushing the Kett threat back, colonising the cluster seem to be very panicked by recent attacks on outlying settlements. They seem familiar...

Basically Pathfinder crew is rushing around trying to confirm it's the Reapers while the Kett are making another push into the cluster. All the other races are curious why the humans seem to be militarizing and frantic. Finally Pathfinder crew shares it with everyone so they know the possible threat. Maybe even finish out the 2nd game with the Kett finding themselves at war with the Reapers and a group splinters off to join the humans and their allies. You end up with a Kett crew member. Maybe hint that there is actually something even worse than the Reapers in Andromeda? 

Just my brain running here but I feel like that could have some great narrative possibilities. For some dark-comedy, the ""oh fuck, come on! We left the milky way to get from them"", the drama and suspense as some of the native allied races blame the humans arrival for bringing ""Doom"", the thrill of hunting down pieces and bits of data from wiped out colonies just to confirm the suspicion that the Reapers are here, the political intrigue as you have to navigate your way through discourse in order to retain allies or lose them.

There'd be a lot of potential in that story, while still keeping it tied to the originals somewhat. The only thing they'd have to do is ensure they explain that those Reapers were already looking for a new Galaxy and won't return to the milky way or something. Otherwise they nullify Shepherd's sacrifice at the end of 3."

witcher,fcuiszf,t1_fcui5q2,1577981958.0,"I just watched E8 last night. My goodness was it stupid.

E4: ""The Beowulf Ripoff"" and E8 were just horrendous. The entire exchange with the speeder troopers was just so unnecessary and stupid. They just had to throw in a bit of that ""avengers"" flair. 

That being said I enjoyed the other episodes. I would like it to be a bit darker and more aggressive next season. For a show about a Mandalorian, a StarWars bounty hunter no less, it is very pedestrian."

If you want some other styles Sullivan King and Riot Ten make some straight banger ""metal-step""

Also Hot Action Cop - Going Down on It, great interval song.

Pretty much all of Bad Meets Evil: The Sequel

I've got a bunch of eclectic lifting playlists that range from rock to edm to rap to glitch. 

Your list is the first one with I see with some sounds that actually get me amped. A lot in this thread are... Pedestrian.

Their dipping sauce is like crack. It has a huge cultlike following. Much like Chick-fil-A and their sauce, Steak n Shake's thousand island (btw just get the cheap store brand and add ketchup. The amount of ketchup will vary but eventually you'll get the color and the exact flavor of Steak n Shakes, homemade pepperjack/Frisco melts in your future!), McDonald's Sweet n Sour, etc.

If you've never tried it, make a small batch, let it rest in the fridge so the black pepper really melds in (like an hour but preferably overnight), go buy some fried chicken (or make it) and dip it. You'll be hooked."

If you remove the hot sauce, it is the recipe for Cane's/Layne's Sauce (second name is familiar for the CStat crowd). The only difference is the addition of hot sauce."
LifeProTips,fc9s7cg,t3_egs81p,1577557423.0,"This may get buried but I wanted to add tithe Bluetooth OBD2 scanners are quite excellent and will allow you to monitor many things in real time as well.

I use Torque Pro, the app, and it allows custom polling rates for logging data. So you can add anything from throttle % to your Fuel trim values.

It'll then save it in a file that can be emailed, opened, and then you can fully go through and really dig deep into how your car is running.

It is really quite handy. I even used it with the cars speed sensor and my phone gps to pull up a second by second satellite map (an option from the xml file export) to show that the cop that stopped me and claimed I was speeding was incorrect. The timestamps didn't match up and I was actually going *under* the speedlimit (I was trying to find a place). Judge accepted the information and dismissed my ticket. (YMMV though).

Bottom line they're cheap, easy to use, and very, very helpful. I just leave mine plugged in and it connects to my phone and starts logging when it starts. Sometimes I'll pull up a custom ""dash"" just to see how my vacuum, coolant, oil temps are without looking at an analog dial in your gauge cluster."

Literally ends up on new planet, the population is in trouble, the AT-ST is somehow groaning and appearing as some sentient beast? (Literally the Grendel beast)

They even captured it in the EXACT SAME MANNER by luring it into a pool (granted in the movie it was oil and it escapes after being severely injured).

If that's the episode 4 then I concur, it was absolutely trash. I really liked all of the others."
