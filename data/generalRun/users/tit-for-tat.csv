>	In December 2015, Godwin commented on the Nazi and fascist comparisons being made by several articles about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, saying: “If you’re thoughtful about it and show some real awareness of history, go ahead and refer to Hitler when you talk about Trump, or any other politician.”[12] In August 2017, Godwin made similar remarks on social networking websites Facebook and Twitter with respect to the two previous days’ Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, **endorsing and encouraging efforts to compare its alt-right organizers to Nazis**.[13][14][15][16]"

**Ingredients**

-	Cabbage, cut/shredded and weighed. 
-	2–3% of the weight of the cabbage in non-iodized salt (e.g., kosher, sea salt)

**Procedure**

1.	In a clean and disinfected suitably sized container (e.g., bowl, bucket), massage the salt into the cabbage throughly. 
2.	Let rest for a while, at least 10 minutes. The water from the cabbage will be dawn out. This brine is what we’re looking for. 
3.	Pack the macerated cabbage into a suitably sized, preferably glass container. 
4.	Top off with the brine, making sure everything is submerged with at least half an inch head room. More if you can. If possible, weigh the cabbage down (e.g., with a fermentation weight, shot glass, whatever works. We want anaerobic conditions here and the fermentation gas will try to make thing float. 
5.	Cover with a tight lid. If you have an airlock, this is the time to use it. If not, make sure you burp this container at least once a day. 
6.	Store in a dark, cool place. 
7.	Let time pass. The longer you wait, the more sour it will be. I like mine at 10–14 days while some people like it at 3 days. 
8.	Enjoy your sauerkraut. Store refrigerated."
