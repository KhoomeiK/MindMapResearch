PLC,fdxm37i,t1_fdxkqi8,1578770499.0,"In stamping  you can use npn so that you only have 1 wire going to the physical location this means that where ever that location is at will have to share a ground or be bonded with the power supply that is processing the input.  Its beneficial in really harsh enviroments  where the number of wires is limited like tight Chanel way that tool and die makers will give you to get sensors out.  

The other reason is you can use the body of the machine to send a signal.  Without brining 24v+ to the location 

If you get the right solid state relay you can convert most digital  at a pretty high rate"

unpopularopinion,fdouel8,t3_emhwxb,1578613106.0,"You have to ask yourself though what is the better way to deal with it.  You don't always have the opportunity to break and have good healthy cry when ever you feel like.  Some times you need to just suck it up and deal with it later.  I think the point your drawing on is that at some time you do deal with it later.  Its an idealism that it never effected you enough that you would have to tend to it,  but I think we all know that if that was true you would just be a numb psychopath 

Men can bottle it up and store it but at a cost 

Women can let it out immediately but at a cost 

Find a middle ground 

This obviously doesn't include severe tragedies that men are more likely to encounter during times of war,  industrial workplace accidents defending thief families 

But at some point somebody has to dry thief eyes and fly the plane that person bares the burden."
