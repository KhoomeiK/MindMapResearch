gadgets,fe1o21r,t1_fe15skh,1578828893.0,"Google Drive isn't a backup service. It isn't meant to be used as a backup service, although it *technically* can be. 

It's important to note that there is a difference in replication and backup. Google Drive is a real-time collaboration and replication service. You download it to your computer and it syncs your files in real-time to their cloud service and any other devices you have connected to it. Which is great until a change gets made and that change is then replaced across your environment too. 

Think about a crypto virus. If it encrypts every file that is shared with Drive, the files everywhere else will also get encrypted. (granted gdrive has versioning and deleted items recovery, but those features aren't **guaranteed**) .

In a basic 3-2-1 bdr plan (backup and disaster recovery) you'll have 3 copies of your date, 2 copies will be hot/warm and 1 copy will be cold. 

The files on your computer and gdrive are one location (hot storage/ live data), external HDD is another (warm storage. Easily accessible backups) , and the files at your backup service are another.(cold storage/ long term/ off-site)

It's great to use replication in tandem with backups because that makes your data always available, but it also runs the same risk as just being stored on your computer because that data is always live.  

Aside from that, there are storage limits and network reliability issues that would impact people with a bunch of data. 



Personally, I have a G-suite and my data is also backed up using Backblaze and scheduled backups to my external drive."
