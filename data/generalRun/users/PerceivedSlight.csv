UpliftingNews,ffthepm,t1_fft2n3q,1580220609.0,"Trek84 is a dumbass. Look. Not every company is the same, but my company understands that new professionals are going to have 'gaps'. The fear with people just out of school is that you have very little practical experience to the point that it cripples functionality and you need hand holding. So what we look for are people who can provide examples of their work in practical applications, someone who can have an easy conversation about the subject, and someone who has a curiosity and willingness to learn more and learn more about how we do things.  
If you're a developer you can try part time freelancing online on sites like Upwork (not easy. Doesn't pay well. But will rub some of your shine off.) And in the meantime start projects independently so you keep gaining experience, except jobs for less than you'd like to make but keep looking for your dream job, and lie on your resume about your experience like everyone else."

todayilearned,ffmsa0i,t1_ffmq7ua,1580058340.0,"We use agile project management so people are assigned a big chunk of work for a set span. They are responsible for organizing their agenda so that everything is done before the end of the sprint. And by done I mean passed critical reviews. Everyone checks in daily and let's their team know what they got done recently, what's up next and if they have any blocks or problems. There's a project manager who touches base with people individually and in groups. We use slack as an IM so people can chit chat privately or in channels. 
The biggest handicap I've run into is that people need to be somewhat disciplined, self-sufficient and able to work with others and that's kind of difficult to come by. If you can't do your part because you need Frank to finish his bit first, fucking message Frank and make arrangements.  
  
Quick edit to add: some people have set hours but most people don't. Aside from making meetings, those people reply to messages and emails within a business day. But usually much sooner. There are people 8 or 12 hours apart in time zones. There are also people who prefer to have a free morning and work in the afternoon or evening. You'd be amazed what can be reasonably accommodated."
