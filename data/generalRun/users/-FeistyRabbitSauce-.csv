AskReddit,ffb8ev6,t1_ffaoxyd,1579754899.0,"Not all plastics can be recycled, many actually. You can toss a straw into that R bin but it'll just get sorted out and trashed. Even the stuff we can recycle is often sold and shipped to companies in Asia (creating a lot of emissions to do so), and a lot of the time it just sits there and or creates litter that gets speard all over those countries and oceans. 

The thing is, there is *so much plastic* we don't know what to do with it. Imagine you have different plastics labeled A B C D E F. They can't really be recycled together because they have different yields and are used for completely different things. What's more, only A and B actually turn a profit, so those other ones get collected or sent to the landfill or whatever. And there's so much A and B, a third of that doesn't even make it through the process either.

Recycling is the last solution. 

Reduce: buy as few plastic items as possible, really think about you're purchases.

Reuse: You were in a position where you needed to buy a bottle of water - keep it, fill it, use it as much as possible. That goes for all things.

Recycle: when something is finally at its end, then it can go.

Part of the problem is that almost everything comes in plastic. And corporations have toyed the narrative that it's on us to dispose of it properly, so just recycle, easy! That way you as a consumer don't feel bad about continually purchasing more and skipping the first two steps that would hurt their bottom line. And it's so easy an convenient to just recycle and not think anything more about it - taken care of, you did your part, good job! But that just isn't the case, I'm sorry.

Many games cost crazy amounts of money to develop, with long development cycles. The base cost of games haven't risen much over the years, so studios have experimented with different ways to generate revenue (loot boxes, special editions, DLC, in game currency, customizations, etc). Then you have these crazy crunches, which frankly will have to be, and probably will be, inevitably addressed and fixed beaause it's too taxing on the employees. When that happens it only makes sense that the dev time and cost will go up as well.

Ergo, I feel like there's going to be a bit of a tatonic shift in the industry, especially around AAA titles. Will the consumer accept a higher base price for games, say $100 per title? Probably, but they may not purchase as many per year, and certainly will expect to receive a full game without pay walls.

movies,ff7u19q,t1_ff7pa4r,1579658351.0,"Depends. How alive are they? Also, even if they say it does will humans agree?

Let's look at some examples. The first being Blade Runner, a film that seems to get a lot of strife these days for the implied sex scene. Many people say it hasn't aged well due to it being ""rape"". However, in this world the machines, or replicants, are not seen as being ""alive"" (they cannot be killed, they are ""retired""), thus, can they consent so such things as sex? Can they care? This world doesn't seem to think so. It's only through Deckard's journey that he begins to see things differently after his encounter with Roy Batty.

Another example would be the show Humans. Now it's been a while since I watched this, but there are similar feelings toward the machines as in Blade Runner. Many are used as sex toys in brothels, they are objects to be owned. The point of the show is that there are a number of the machines who feel they deserve the same rights as everyone else and that they are not ""less-than"" simply because we made them.

What we have to ask ourselves is what capacity do we have to feel for something that we know is not 100% organic? Do we believe them when they tell us they have emotions and dreams or are they simply programed to say so? Is their programing any different than ours just because it's compiled by a bunch of ones and zeros? Or are they no more than a glorified toaster?

It's an interesting philosophical question that could very well come to fruition some day.
