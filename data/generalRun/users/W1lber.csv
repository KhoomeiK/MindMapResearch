You sound like me when I was your age, and now I'm 36 so please don't stress to much about wasting your life. 

As for your friend, she really doesn't sound like your friend. Friends dont say that to other people that you don't talk and that you are shy. She should just expect that is you.. and that's what makes you special..

I promise in a few years this won't seem like a big deal. You don't need to go out to parties or have sex or drink.. that's just feelings of being like everyone else. But I promise, you will find your whole special friends, even if it's one or two people to make you really happy. I have two extra special friends who I can be stupid with and they don't judge me.. but I'm still very shy around new people.. but I've come to learn that's just me. 

And you will too. So don't worry about feeling like you are wasting your time cos I promise you with all of my heart, you really aren't :)"
britishproblems,ffnyizm,t3_eua1vt,1580072282.0,"No!! No no no!! I work for a big supermarket on a Sunday and this is my huge bugbare cos I wanna go home at half four! But the amount of people coming shopping at 4 and then saying ""oh sorry I forgot what time the shops shut on a Sunday!"" No Karen!! Not that bullshit excuse every week! 

Also.. another one is when customers expect to pay for their shopping before 10 and then get miffed why they cant. Cos it's the law.. ""oh when did that happen??"" 

Seriously. Kill me."
britishproblems,ffnxje6,t3_eu8x4d,1580072036.0,I once went into Poundland when it first opened with my mum. We looked around and she asked me how much something cost cos it didn't have a price sticker.. *facepalm*
chernobyl,ffnx5gt,t3_eu7u4j,1580071887.0,"I discovered on VR Google maps.. and you can actually go inside the new confinement and actually look at the building. It really feels like you are standing there Infront of it. 

Also.. I discovered yesterday in Google maps you can visit Pripyat and the theme park :)"
socialanxiety,ffnwqc7,t3_eu8648,1580071742.0,"Last week a girl at work said something about a party and said ""well you won't be going!"" And she laughed.. I felt guilty about cancelling parties in the past, but then I thought nope!! So I replied ""yeah, forget me and parties!!"" And made a joke out of it. 

I much prefer cake and coffee and being able to chat instead.. that way I'm more likely to go and not feel guilty!"
socialanxiety,ffnwbs3,t1_ffnvrvx,1580071574.0,"No I don't think they are being cruel.. or unkind.. but I'm just on guard lol. If they do say it, I normally smile and say something to raise a smile :)"
anxietymemes,ffnvp7c,t1_ffnv97m,1580071446.0,"Getting sick is a trigger for me too. Hopefully when you are feeling better all of your thoughts and anxieties will go with it too :) 

my counselor told me that when these thoughts come along tell them to go away. You have the power to do it cos it's only a thought and because it's YOUR thought you can send it away :)"
anxietymemes,ffnul08,t3_eucc3s,1580071035.0,"Ah.. I can relate. Everything comes down to ""is it cancer??"".. which makes me sound like a complete and utter paranoid freak. 

But I'm not that bad.. its just that sometimes my problems go on for a while or reoccurring so it's natural to think the worst. 

I too have been to therapy to understand why I automatically go to to worst possible thing.. and she told me that if I can think it's the worst possible thing, so when it isnt that, then I will be okay. It's not healthy and I am trying to not to go straight to the C word.. so deep breath. 

Hope you feel better soon"
