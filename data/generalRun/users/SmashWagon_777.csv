ZeldaMemes,fduc70j,t3_en2kms,1578731033.0,"I think Skyward Sword had the best story, with Twilight Princess and Majora’s mask closely following second. Windwaker also had a really good story as well as ALBW, LA, ALTTP, and OOT. Breath of the Wild has a lot of potential with the story, but since it’s told through memories, it doesn’t completely feel like it’s a necessary part of the game. Judging from Breath of the Wild 2’s sequel trailer, I can already tell that it’s going to have a really good story"
