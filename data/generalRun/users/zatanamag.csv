WoT,ffdongx,t3_eszzec,1579825342.0,"I don't think most characters like Nynaeve or Egwene are that busty. It's never mentioned them being that big especially as compared to other characters. Moiraine definitely wasn't. Min isn't either. Aviendha was mentioned as being fuller chested than other Maidens but I don't know how big that would necessarily make her.

I think Robert Jordan was very much a boob guy but I don't think he let it bleed into the characters much."
