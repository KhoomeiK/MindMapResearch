technology,feol1hz,t1_feoiee7,1579301607.0,"I have several objections with this line of thinking and it comes up on reddit a lot.

1) It assumes there is some spectrum parties fall on and you can place them neatly on an axis and it's easy to denote one is clearly to the ""left"" or ""right"", when politics is multi-dimensional. 

If you ask redditors what makes the US right wing they'll say ""Well not even all Democrats support single payer whereas even conservative parties in Canada/UK do!"". By that logic, even the furthest right wing party in the UK is to the left of all Dutch politicians, since the NHS actually is socialist health care whereas Dutch uses a system of multi-payer insurance companies. 

Additionally, different countries care about different issues. It just makes sense to talk about politics locally. In the UK, Brexit is a divisive issue. Is that left or right? How do you place US politicians based on Brexit when none of them have an opinion on it? What about Hong Kong's wish for autonomy against China? Left or right wing?

2) It assumes that Europe is the default against which to calibrate against. ""America is right wing compared to Germany!"". Even if so but it's left wing compared to Saudi Arabia. 

So if we're saying that America is myopic *about its political calibration* because it doesn't look outside its borders, then you should include the global spectrum. This is where people start to narrow it down certain countries and say ""we shouldn't try to emulate X, Y, Z countries anyway"", but then the whole exercise falls apart anyway. It just shows politics is relative and cross-country comparisons don't make a ton of sense.

3) The US is a two-party system, which ends up with parties that are big tents and encompass many different viewpoints. Is Bernie center-right? What about AOC? There are many factions within the parties, so to lump them all into one averaged bucket and say they're left or right compared to some smaller tent party in another country makes even less sense.

There's my rant, do what you will with it."
