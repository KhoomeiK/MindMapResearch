If your phone has it, try out the manufacturer version. Samsung's keyboard is pretty good.

If you're even a little bit savvy you could easily find an old Swype .apk file and use it, but that's more of a band-aid fix and you won't have the full functionality since the servers have been off for awhile now. Eventually, phone updates will kill it completely."
Android,fh8o3ub,t1_fh801cj,1581363848.0,"Yeah, the capitalizing random words that didn't need to be capitalized because I capitalized it once when quoting someone six months ago got super fucking annoying. 

The predictive text got really bad for me, too. It wouldn't correct words nearly as well as it used to, and would constantly throw up ridiculous replacements and not the word I wanted. Like while talking with my wife about our stepson's band I'd go to type ""tuba"" and it'd throw up ""tuna"" and the alternatives would be tunnel or turn or some stupid shit like that. Like, seriously, Swiftkey? I just said tuba three fucking times in the last six messages and you think I'm talking about fish or tunnels?"
Android,fh8mxoj,t3_f1pqre,1581363139.0,"I've been using Swiftkey since I got my first Android phone (HTC Inspire) after retiring the iPhone 3g. I've tested other keyboards and never really felt the need to change. Phone after phone, it was always damn near the perfect keyboard. I'd give the various manufacturer keyboards a shot when I got a new phone, or the Gboard when it came around, but the little quirks and differences kept me going back to SwiftKey. I did use Gboard for a little while on my Essential Ph-1 for a few days before giving up and going back to SwiftKey. Hell, I even bought themes back when it cost way too much money for a too small pack of them.

But over the last few months, I've been getting increasingly disappointed in the app. The predictive text has seemingly been getting worse and worse. Once upon a time, I could practically type one or two letters and then spam the center button and say what I needed to. Now it's throwing random words I might have typed once three years ago in. Or not correcting misspellings like it used to. 

I just upgraded to a Galaxy Note 9 last week and when I went to download a keyboard, I stopped for a second and thought. I ended up grabbing Gboard this time out. It's been a bit of a hassle getting used to some of the differences. Not being able to tap the caps key after typing a word to capitalize it has been a pain in the ass and I never realized how much I relied on that feature. But honestly, I can't say sticking with SwiftKey anymore is worth it. Especially with these types of updates that double as downgrades."

FallenOrder,fh8hom5,t1_fh7vm7k,1581359952.0,"I can't imagine there won't be a part two. The game was very much a surprise in how well it sold for EA. 

But there needs to be some fundamental changes to the system. Give us better unlockables than three ponchos with six palette swaps each and one outfit with three palette swaps. Don't make us constantly revisit areas to do the same platforming over and over again to get to a crate with one of those meh unlockables. Give us better incentives to go back, and give us interesting and fun things to do when we do go back. Even if it's just more combat. Combat is more fun and fluid than doing the same platform over and over again. Especially if the platforming keeps getting easier and easier as my character gets stronger and stronger."
FallenOrder,fh8guph,t1_fh87el2,1581359447.0,"I disagree. Most of the ponchos were utter shit. Pretty much all the leather styles were fugly. The fabric styles weren't *as* bad. But three identical outfits that are different colors was bad. 

Combine that with the heavy focus on platforming and limited or no combat in some locations, revisiting areas that were previously blocked off because you didn't have certain abilities gets repetitive really fast.

The game does a very good job at blending the Middle Earth and Dark Souls style gameplays, but it's not perfect at it. If you want me going back into the same areas over and over again, you've got to do something to make it fun. Combat works because the same fight against a mix of enemies can go differently each time, especially with new abilities popping up. Puzzles not so much since you either have to keep resolving the same puzzle over and over again. Platforming just gets easier as you get stronger.

NotAnotherDnDPodcast,fh7dvfn,t1_fh79ecp,1581326714.0,"I wholeheartedly disagree that it'd be anti-climactic. 

First off, Thala was already who she is now, just not juiced up an God hearts yet. Alanis explains as much when the Boobs meet her in the Fey wild. 

Second, not having both hearts isn't a huge deal. She can still absorb Asmodeus's and be plenty strong enough for a satisfying final battle.


Third, this route makes the Boobs make a very hard choice and major sacrifices for the greater good. They can save Bahumia, prevent all the carnage and damage, but at steep personal costs. I think that level of strong storytelling would more than makeup for fighting a ""weaker"" Thiala.

We know Moonshine would give up her soul for her people and her friends, but would she give up her friends to save the world and put it back together as they knew it?

Would Hardwon give up Bev and Moonshine? Give up saving his Mom? Give up even knowing where he came from? 

Does Bev give up his scoutmasters? Possibly sacrifice his friends and first love because the Boobs aren't there to save them from the Bullywugs? 

Collectively, do they give up all the good they did in general? 

I don't there is ***anything*** anti-climactic about that.

As for your prediction.... Honestly, that sounds like rehashing the plot from the Tales From the Crick chapter, with God powers instead of elemental ones. I don't see Murph reusing old plots ideas. Especially for the final, ultimate battle.

Further, Murph has made it abundantly clear, both in-game and on the Short Rest, Pelor is dead. Gods in Bahumia have a celestial heart and Thiala ripped his out to power herself up more.

And, last, the whole one-shot theory is just bad. Murph doesn't need to do that. He's a good DM. He knows how to balance a fight and how to adjust on the fly if need be. And even if he did, the Boobs will likely be a few levels higher by the time they go at Thiala meaning any ""testing"" now would be for nothing."

The last construction job I had was kind of odd. Some tools I needed high quality stuff that'd last. Likehammer drills, impact driver, drill, good sawzall, etc. But some stuff I barely used. I used my circular like twice, three times a week, and usually only to cut something like thin plywood or 2x4s for mounting to. 

I actually think that is why Black & Decker has gotten so bad these days. Brands like Makita, Kobalt, Husky, and even Milwaukee closed the gap on them. There's a strong market for tools that aren't super high-end professional quality, but still need to be better than consumer grade.

And why would someone buy a cheap B&D drill covered in crap plastic when for a few bucks more, he can get much highes quality? So, B&D's quality keeps getting worse and worse to keep prices as low as possible. I may not mind paying $100 for a decent impact/drill combo set instead of $90 But when it's $60 vs. $100?

They used Dewalt because the brand was recognizable because it had been used for making specialty tools for shops, like big saws and drill presses. It had name recognition and a favorable reputation among tradesmen."

That''s a really neat idea, but I really don't see it happening.

None of the Boobs are near powerful enough to cast it. Hardwon doesn''t do magic. Bev can't go past level 5 spells as a paladin and you know, his god is dead. Moonshine is a Druid, so she can get a level 9 slot, but she also took a level of barbarian and I''m not sure of how some of their home brew / custom stuff works, I have a feeling she gives up some spellcasting ability as a trade off for her fungal form.

I don't think Alanis would even be powerful enough even if Thiala didn't have her captured in her focusing gem thing.

My guess is the Boobs do something with a spell that is in their league. Namely, the Wish Spell.

I could see it going something like, the Boobs fight the Horsemen to gain the spell components that they need. They then wish to go back in time to fight the Legendary Heroes after they kill Asmodeus, but before Thiala can consume/absorb his heart. 

It leaves Murph with plenty of room to play around, makes the fight more than the Boobs vs. Uber-powerful Thiala. It can add some play with how Alanis and Ulfgar react. Is it Alanis after she's done her own wish spells? Can they convince Ulfgar to join the woman he loves even as she was unable to do so herself in her previous attempts? Bev can get his backing from Pelor back.


 It also really sets things up for an end of the Band of Boobs, without necessarily ending them. could play well for some live/Patreon one-offs down the line. How different would things have been? Without the Chosen affecting politics in Galaderon, does Bev still end up in Moonstone for the Jamborine? Does Hardwon still lose Gemma or does Wilhelm tolerate him with no real threats around? Without Crick Rot, does Moonshine still find an excuse to leave the Crick? Does Paw Paw get his whimple?!

Because, sadly, that's how people think.

The problems with Scott Peterson are very similar to the problems with Casey Anthony, down to the Grand Poombah cuntwaffle Nancy Grace running her mouth. In both the investigators did bad jobs, and the prosecutors relied too heavily on ""eh, the jury will hate them and convict"". The only difference being in one case the perpetrator walked. And arguably, there was better evidence pointing at Anthony than Peterson overall.

TrueCrime,fh03f1u,t1_fgzsxvd,1581200146.0,"Let me put it like this.

If there is exculpatory evidence that police ignored and the judge in the appeal finds it strong enough, he can order a new trial and release Scott until the state brings charges. Then the judge on the new trial could exclude previous evidence based on falsehoods and mistakes in reports and warrant requests that could get evidence thrown out and tank any case against him.

That's why it's so damn important for the evidence to be followed up on and police to do their jobs right.

And it's little things that add up. From  my link, one of the detectives brought up he felt like Scott was lying and being deceptive early on because he said he and Laci watched Martha Stewart and she talked about meringue in the episode. The cop said she actually didn't and it proved he was lying. But she did and the cop was wrong. 

How fucked up would it be it Scott Peterson killed his wife and gets off because some cop decided he was guilty because he didn't watch an episode of Martha fucking Stewart all the way through like he should have as part of the investigation? Because that's arguably possible if a judge decides that it tainted the warrant and made the search illegal and made any evidence collected from that warrant inadmissible."

All the evidence about the burglary, Laci sightings, the boat capsizing, etc were looked into and clearly in the case file.

You clearly don't know the difference between a trial case file and an investigation.

Personally, I think Scott did it, but the police failed to do a proper job investigating the case and he did not get a fair trial in the end. A lot of what I see in this case is the exact same things that we saw in the Casey Anthony case, with the exception being she was acquitted in the end.

Two, the pants she was wearing the night before were tan capris. The police did a clothing line up months later with a friend who saw her the night before and asked her to pick out ""the capris she was wearing"" from several pants. Only one pair of pants in the line up were capris.

A case doesn't magically lose the fact that it should be open and shut because the prosecution fuck it up. OJ, Casey Anthony, Hernandez, etc. all should have been pretty easy cases to win.

In the Hernandez case, the prosecutor decided to lean heavily on an eyewitness/accomplice. A good prosecutor would have known that his testimony wasn't matching what was being shown in the security footage. A good prosecutor would have never put that dude on the stand and focused on the evidence that did support his case. The vehicle, that it sat hidden for over a year in Hernandez's aunt's garage. That they could tie him to the scene, and that he and his accomplice were the only possible perpetrators.
