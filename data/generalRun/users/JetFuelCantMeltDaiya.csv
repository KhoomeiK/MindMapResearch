I can see the challenge in trying to balance the questions so that they continue to get as many safe donations as possible, but also cut out the higher risk factors and keep the number of questions reasonably long.

Some countries like Spain and Italy have decided to add question around monogamy and sex practices, so that restrictions are less based on sexual orientation, that said, those countries have ended up having significantly higher rates of HIV-positive blood donation tests.
