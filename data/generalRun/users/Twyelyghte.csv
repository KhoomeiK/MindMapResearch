GetMotivated,ff2o36t,t1_ff2merl,1579515784.0,Its a fear that especially strikes the hearts of language learners. Should I learn the language that I love versus the language I hear everyday in my daily life (that I don't really enjoy). Analysis paralysis up the wazoo.

I would be very surprised if Hebrew or Greek had any notes on the alphabet, since those courses are noticeably abandoned."
languagelearningjerk,ff2lghg,t1_feolkfq,1579511718.0,"Russian, yes it is a direct 1:1 most time, except for the ts or tsch letters.

Hebrew you're being a bit unfair about. The Hebrew course does not annotate vowel sounds, except for A, which has its own letter. Hebrew is an abjad, which means that vowels are pretty much optional, while all of the consonant sounds are transcribed."
GetMotivated,ff2l8vq,t3_eqftuf,1579511406.0,"Good message but tbh you can eat garbage food an lose weight. Its all about calories in versus calories out. Look at a nutrition chart of McDonalds/Subway/etc, compare it to what you're eating at home, then go for menu items that have even 200-400 calories less and consume that. You're body literally could not give a fuck that its processed food; you'll still lose weight."

>  
>I think I was using language learning to fill an 'angst', set myself  differently from other people, build an identity. Because learning a  language is so hard, those are not reasons enough to learn a language. 

I feel both the same way, wanting to set up an identity by distancing myself from the average person.

I wouldn't say that I was traumatized by Japanese; I just regret not having learned to speak at a basic level while I was living there."
makemychoice,fdy3p8l,t1_fdttfie,1578775753.0,">Also, why not both eventually?

Good question. I'd tried studying another language alongside Japanese before, but it was very taxing. I consider Japanese a language that you'd have to give 100% of your attention to, or else even the easier parts of the language start slipping away.

I think I will do both... eventually. My goal for each language is different; with German I want to take a more active role as a speaker/typing online, while with Japanese my main goal is to consume. I'll go for German first, try to become fluent, then I can have all the time I need to practice Japanese."
makemychoice,fdy2d2f,t1_fdt9rsq,1578775317.0,"Eh, I work retail. I'm planning on learning to program or web dev, which wouldn't necessitate a lot of travel, but it might open up opportunities abroad. Between Germany and Japan, I'd rather work in Germany because it would be so easy to vacation in neighboring European countries."
makemychoice,fdy1yi4,t3_en21r6,1578775181.0,"Thank you everyone for your input! The variance in answers here was probably not as helpful in making a *definite* decision as I would have expected, but reading the different answers gave me some new perspective.

I'm come up with a sort of **compromise**: I will study Japanese over the summer, each summer, as a sort of summer project. Japanese will probably take many years to reach any basic fluency, but to be honest I already have a lot of what I could ever want already translated into English. Since I have no plans on moving back to Japan or talking to Japanese people, so there's really not any urgency to study *right now*.

I will focus on learning German, which I have more hopes of achieving fluency. I already have a lot of reading material lined up that I can start reading in a few months of practice. Welp, time to get back to studying."

languagelearning,fcrdecm,t3_eikga7,1577900328.0,"By no means is the easiest, but I studied Spanish and Japanese back-to-back in middle school. It was doable for me, because one course advanced at a snail's pace due to the sheer difficulty of the language (Japanese) and the other I absorbed material much faster. Since the two languages are from completely different language families, I never experienced any interference. If you're okay with learning at different rates, maybe you could do something similar.

Personally I'd stick to learning a single language because you will make more progress devoting your time to a single goal."
books,fciftlw,t3_eh0drw,1577661888.0,"No specific book springs to mind, but my personal bedside library isn't *my* library without at least a few Stephen King novels on it. I used to go through moves, which most times ended in me donating almost all of my books, including my Stephen King books, so while no specific title has endured, I have an overarching love for the author himself. 

With Stephen King as the foundation, the rest of my shelf is dedicated either to horror, fantasy, or classics. Horror is my favorite genre of books and movies and I think I have Goosebumps and Stephen King to thank for that. I never really liked fantasy a kid, because it seemed like a dorky heroics fantasy, like LoTR or Star Wars. It wasn't until I got into The Gentlemen Bastard's series that I could find morally grey protagonists in a fantasy setting and enjoy it."
