It was slowing down and I started getting on my manager about letting me go and finally he did. Right after I left fucking Woody Harrelson came in and smoked a fatty with my co-worker. Hung out way past the bar closed with all the staff. I’m not one who cares much about celebrities, but woody is fuckin cool. Kicking myself to this day about that one."

I don’t think a good deed is nullified by posting online for fake internet points by any means, I just don’t understand the need to. I think it’s super lame if the good deed is done for the points though.

Then we found it on a stolen bike forum later. Couldn’t keep it with a clean conscience obviously. Dude was super happy to get it back and paid me back for what I spent.

I didn’t post it on social media for internet points though, I just did it cause it’s the right thing to do.

Nothing he said was *overtly douchy, just kinda rubbed me wrong. Then I read all these stories about people working with him and what an asshole he is, and it all clicked. He’s obviously a very intelligent guy, but he just gets off on making sure everyone knows it. It seems he has a passion for that just as much as science. Then I heard him on Joe Rohan, and it was unbearable. I honestly wish he didn’t narrated cosmos, cause I really love that stuff, and I can’t stand to hear his voice at this point."

Whatever though, that’s awesome what he does, and he has my respect.

Edit: disregard what I said about the speech, I was wrong. The world needs more selfless people like this. He more than has my respect. I wish the glaring difference between people like this and celebrities who always make sure everyone’s watching when they’re donating to disaster relief but own sweatshops was brought to light more often. This guy is quietly doing more for humanity than most.
