Basically what I meant to say is Apple has enough of a market share that they don't need to worry about making any of their exclusive features available to Android users. They are more than profitable enough on what they have and they have the better brand recognition (that's more so what I was thinking that they have over Android in the U.S.). Because of their brand, they actually benefit from a certain level of exclusivity and keeping some users out."
Android,ffh4xdg,t1_ffgfs93,1579923219.0,"Good names for products/services is key. You know it's successful when people use the product/services name as a verb (for example, no matter what taxi/ride share service you use, most people just say ""hey let's Uber there"").

In the U.S. at least (their biggest market), Apple's market share over Android is large enough where they 100% can get away with having it be exclusive to iPhone. It's a smart way for them to retain their user base as well. Useful, well executed, exclusive features makes the people they have less likely to leave the ecosystem as well as makes people who are on the fence or have a foot in both worlds (for example i prefer Android for mobile but Mac for my laptop) more likely to pick a side."
Android,ffh31iv,t1_ffgql2r,1579921756.0,"Sending files for free on Pushbullet is limited to 25mb and sending message replies in messaging apps is limited to just 100 a month in the free tier. So yeah you can just not pay a dime, but the benefits are quite limited. And unfortunately it's one of those services that is convenient, but not worth what they are charging to get past those limitations. So that's why i personally had switched to AirDroid, sending files and especially lots of messages is the main reasons i used the app and AirDroid has slightly higher file size sending limitation and unlimited messages in the free tier (and on top of that their paid tier is cheaper than Pushbullet's paid tier). It's definitely fair that a lot of people ditched Pushbullet when they introduced their payment model. Their way of divvying up what would be available for free versus what would be paid, especially for the stuff like messaging, wasn't really balanced properly."

The new phone very well may not be good, because yeah there's a past track record of not good product. But making that assumption and not checking for yourself stops you from seeing any change in the present or future because you've made up your mind about them based on the past. That's a bias and that's what is happening when people see ""Trump said..."" And assume it's a lie with fact checking for themselves. The assumption more often being right that it was in fact a lie doesn't stop the logic path we took to get to that decision from being a bias. Maybe I'm wording it wrong, but I'm not saying people are wrong to assume what Trump says is a lie, I'm saying the fact that people just assume and don't check for themselves is bad. It's pointing out a pattern of blond believing, which people who don't like Trump can be just as guilty of as people who blindly do believe the fake news he spews.

PS4,ffdrz10,t1_ffd8736,1579827460.0,"Nintendo fans i feel like are both the most brand loyal and most brand disloyal at the same time. Everyone who has a Nintendo console LOVES the consoles and LOVES the games/tried and true IP. Nintendo fans tend to be very hardcore about their Nintendo love. However, at the same time, very few people are Nintendo *only* gamers. Most people who would identify as ""gamers"" are never Nintendo exclusive console buyers. People's Nintendo love is almost always complimentary to Xbox/PlayStation/PC gaming love. Almost never is it the primary from what i've seen. I'd be willing to say/bet that the vast majority of them also all are major PlayStation and/or Xbox gamers. Where as both PlayStation and Xbox gamers are by far more likely to ""choose a side"" and have just one that they stick with from generation to generation.

They could also just have making of featurette's or have commentary tracks along with the other language audio tracks.

That's because attraction is subjective. Everyone's personal definition of who is in what league and who is too good or not good enough for who is entirely different from person to person. You might see a guy who you personally think is better than you, but he might not think you're beneath him. But by limiting yourself to what you think you are allowed to go for, you make the decision (a no) for him. Rather than taking the risk to find out if it might have been a yes. I'd rather take the risk getting a no for the possibility of it being a yes, compared to just not trying at all. Leagues are a self imposed limitation. Let the other guy be the one to say yes/no.

Especially when you're actually in real world places where you have no way to know who is or isn't straight/gay/bi/whatever. And especially with younger guys it's common for gay and bi guys to start out in the closet usually. 

So if a guy they like or are attracted to exhibits behaviour that they deem to be suspect, it will ping their gaydar and they will begin to have hope that there is something there. Maybe you're the first guy this guy is into, maybe he's bicurious, maybe he's gay and in the closet and is signaling to you. So on and so forth. 90% of the time, the guy is straight and the gay guy is just misinterpreting friendliness or seeing what he wishes to see. Every now and then, that guy is actually bi/bicurious/gay/closeted/whatever. If it's not 100% clear which case it is, it's generally in human nature to pursue the opportunity on the chance it plays out in your favor, even if the actual odds of that happening are low because if it does play out in their favor, the reward is greater than the risk. It's why people play the lottery. This stuff is *very far* from being clear cut and easy to decipher unless you're in a gay bar where it's basically guaranteed that everyone in the room is LGBT. Otherwise, those confusing behaviours are enough circumstantial evidence for a young inexperienced gay to think something may be there and so they come here seeking advice from unbiased readers. Advice is literally the point of the sub.

It's not about them lusting after a guy that's actually straight (except for the comparatively small amount of instances where it is one of those creeper gay guys who specifically chase straight men to ""turn"" them), it's them just desperately hoping he *isn't* actually straight and are looking for a third party to confirm or shoot down their hopes. Other than ""how do i bottom"" and ""did i catch HIV?"" Young gays trying to navigate who is and isn't straight is a pretty normal/typical/frequent part of the experience and it's why it's such a common post here. It's likely to not go anywhere any time soon. It's been a dominating topic on this sub literally for *years*."
LosAngeles,fdisp4h,t3_elh1sg,1578450179.0,"In addition to what others have already said. On the chance a quake is bad enough where you're in a shelter or have no access to power/outlets for days at a time. Get a very high capacity power pack/battery bank. It will be a smaller more portable thing to carry around to keep your devices like phones (and laptops if it's a high capacity/powerful enough battery bank) charged if you aren't near your gas or solar generator which is likely bigger and more cumbersome to carry around. 

Some battery banks are big enough to, when fully charged, charge your phone 5 or 6 times or more. Which could get you by for a week or so on that alone if you are frugal with your phone use. Some battery banks even have little solar panels on them, so you can lay it out in the sun for a couple hours and be able to charge your phone another 5 times."
oneplus,fdhev4p,t1_fdh8gs4,1578421167.0,"> that's why tesla caps their batteries and can enable a longer range for disasters and emergencies

You're not wrong, but you have two different things Tesla does a little mashed together. Tesla is able to do that because there was a time when they'd sell a car with say, a 100kwh battery pack that was software limited to 75kwh to make a different and cheaper SKU of the car for consumers without them having to actually physically produce a different SKU. As a courtesy/good gesture, they'd unlock the range of those software locked cars for people in disaster areas and then revert it back when the emergency was over. They couldn't do it for people who already were using the full 100kwh capacity cars. Them doing that wasn't a battery health thing. What they did do for battery health is the other part you mentioned where they basically build in the ""don't charge over 90%"" thing into the software. When you charge the car and it says 100% full the actual battery is only like 90% full, and when it goes to 0% there's still technically like 5% left, because it still has to retain some charge in order to take in more energy. That's the part that helps it maintain such great battery health over the long term (that plus software and other hardware optimization with good battery chemistry)."

But i personally have found ""cute"" to be the most harmless. Only guys who have insecurities about their masculinity have issues being called cute, in my own personal experience at least and that's generally not something i want to deal with anyway. Also, instead of cute/handsome/hot, which have all the connotational issues you mentioned, you could go with complimenting their style. Compliment an item of clothing they are wearing and make it about their choice to wear that item or specifically how they are wearing that item rather than the item itself. It makes the compliment about their style choice/decision making and not just ""that's a nice shirt"" which is more so a compliment to the designer of the shirt. You can put that twist on almost any compliment too. Like if the guy works out, instead of ""whoa, hot bod"", say you admire his dedication to the gym and the results of his efforts are apparent and his ability to stick with it says a lot about him. Though at a certain point, if you're *too* safe about it, the guy may not get the cue that you're trying to communicate that you're attracted to him. It's a balancing act of making your intentions known while not being too overly sexual (unless you're going for a hookup, then turn the sexual dial to 11)."

It'll be the same for every single one of these battery breakthroughs for a while to come still. It's getting there though, it's just going to happen slowly, because like another commenter said, batteries are pretty close to the peak of what they're capable of and bringing out those last couple percentage points of the what these new chemistries can do takes more time/effort.

Android,fcuxynx,t1_fcuudeu,1577990754.0,"No it's actually not. Depending on the corporate structure, and the type of businesses/products, it actually can be pretty separate.

In other cases though, the companies are more along the lines of entire limbs that are part of the same body. They're all getting messages from the same brain but they don't necessarily have to do everything together, at the same time, or even be doing the same thing if that makes sense. Or even like a sibling companies that share a parent but are their own people living their own lives, as a slightly more literal analogy. 

Either way too, even in your Chevy, Cadillac and Toyota example. GM is paying for everything, but on the actual functional level. It's still 3 separate teams coming together to do the collaboration. Toyota, Cadillac and Chevy all have their own CEOs, finance people, marketing people, their own teams of scientists for battery tech, and so on and those teams would have to work together in your scenario same as they would if there were multiple parent companies involved instead of just GM.

I don't think the two necessarily compare. Some way to describe your vibe and mannerisms is normal. Some people call themselves chill and laid back, some people say they have a skater vibe, some people used to call themselves rockers and this and that so that the person reading a dating profile can get a general sense of what they are like before they meet. With the exception of ""nice guy"" which is a whole separate can of worms. No one ever seems to have an issue with people describing their vibe/aura/mannerisms (whatever you want to call it, same thing) until the word masculine is used though. Then all of a sudden it's ""real masculine guys don't need to advertise it"" and all these other various negative reactions. I think that's interesting because it seems to only be an issue that exclusive to the LGBT+ community. No one in the straight world is bothered when some woman describes herself as a tomboy or a girly girl or a business man/woman or a guys' guy or whatever else, because straight people know what is meant and that it's just meant to help paint a picture. By your logic, no one should ever describe themselves in anyway (don't call yourself funny, or witty, or smart, or well read, or literally anything that normally is said on a dating profile) because if you are actually that thing then you shouldn't need to advertise it, right?"

Android,fctv8fy,t1_fcsysvm,1577961274.0,"> Which price oriented do you mean, like a full-on flagship price?

Yeah. OnePlus is not trying to be PocoPhone or Xiaomi phones that costs $300. People have to get that out of their heads, that's not OnePlus anymore. They are trying to be like 85-90% of a Galaxy/Pixel for a couple hundred dollars less than what they charge. They're doing near full on flagship phones for mid to upper midrange prices, rather than trying to compete in the 800-1100 range the Galaxy and Pixels and iPhones compete in. They want to pack as much into the phone as possible without tipping over into that 850+ line (Mclaren Edition excluded) where the Pixels and Galaxy phones start at. They'll keep letting the price creep up though long as the Pixel/Galaxy keeps creeping up to and giving OnePlus the head room to increase but still stay a little below what Google and Samsung charge. That's the balancing act they're trying to maintain. So i could see how maybe they looked at the financials and realized they can't have pop up selfie cams, high refresh rate screens, keep their software good (which has been a slight struggle for them recently with an increasing amount of phones to support and also isn't a big expense Xiaomi has since they just copy iOS), all the other expected specs and also stay below $800."
