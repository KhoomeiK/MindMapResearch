I have a damaged/torn labrum that will need surgery. Benchpress, push-ups, overhead press, and sometimes French press give that **exact** feeling you're speaking of. My ortho said it's because of my shoulder injury directly (my whole shoulder sags from the displacement with the injury) and indirectly (the displacement is causing strain on my tendons, triceps, etc.)"

Coyotes are not native to NC, they've migrated in the last 40 years from out west."

Family had an ostrich pen of 10+ ostriches. Never knew why. We ate the eggs, told the little ones they were dinosaur eggs (they look like oblong cantaloupes). Dared each other to either ride one of them, or run from one end of the pen to the other as fast as possible. But other than that, never knew why we had those assholes. They hated everything.

Coyotes killed/ate the last one in 2002. (Coyotes were introduced into the area a few years prior)"
television,fdf4o1j,t1_fdexqq5,1578353224.0,"It's a very, VERY expensive stunt to do. There's a lot of man hours of prep that goes into it, extra SPFX and emergency personnel on standby. A film set is always rushed within relatively safe parameters. When these types of stunts are on deck, there is NO rush. (Safe and good) Production staff **insist** on the stunt, SPFX and emergency personnel have all the time they need. This usually takes hours of on-set, shoot-day setup. Lot of standing around by folks not directly involved. Once everything is finally set up, been checked, re-checked, re-re-checked, and re-re-re-checked. Everyone on set is invited to ask questions, check the safety of anything they wish to. Once the all clear is given, and **everyone** on set has signaled they are OK with what's about to happen...

*Time seemingly stops.*

If only for a few seconds... Right before we call action, there's something inside of you that says *""This is so stupid. We're playing make-believe out here... and we're literally going to actually light someone on fire. This is so reckless.""*

And then they call action. It all goes without a hitch. Every second the stuntperson is on fire seems like an eternity. They call cut, emergency personnel immediately extinguish the flames and establish the condition of the performer. The performer signals the O.K. (and usually laughs, asking to go again, because stunt folks are crazy), and work continues.

Stunt people rightly receive ""stunt adjustments"" from production in addition to their daily/3-day/weekly salary. The adjustments are pre-negotiated and given at the end of the day. Due to the extremely dangerous nature of stunts like burning someone, usually it carries the highest adjustment rates possible ($7,500 - $10,000) and is given each instance the stunt is performed. Two or Three takes? Two or Three of that adjustment amount, then.

Just giving folks an idea of how this works. Source: Have filmed a burning performer scene."

My driving record is spotless, I would just have to figure out how to go about insurance with this... as well as figure out how much money I feasibly would make.

EDIT: Nevermind.. called both companies and checked online too.. they don't offer these programs in my area. Great idea, though"
