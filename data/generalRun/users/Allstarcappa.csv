Gen 6- Greninja

Gen 7- Decideye

Gen 8- Rillaboom

I like cinderaces design also but feel like its too basic for me. Raboot got me excited thinking he would end up becoming a ninja rabbit with deadly kicks of doom, but then surprise soccer mon."
WizardsUnite,ffs8u9r,t1_ffqr6jk,1580175974.0,"Niantic treats this games community like shit compared to pokemon go. Look at this horse ass garbage ""bonus assignment"" bundle they put out in the store. 20 dollars, 2100 coins even for 2,750 coins worth of value. Now that may seem like a good savings, but go look at pokemon gos adventure box that is a permanent feature of the game and always there.

1480 coins (which is like 15 dollars in value) for 15 super incubators (pogo keys), 3 star piece for bonus dust, 3 incense for more spawns and 3 normal incubators. The 15 super incubators that hatch eggs .5x faster alone cost 3000 coins, and if you spend 20 dollars you get 2,500 coins which leaves you with over 1000 coins left over to increase storage or do what you want.

And the super and regular incubators can be used 3x each where the keys can only be used once. So really thats like getting 45 super incubators and 15 normal ones meaning for 20 dollars you can hatch 20 eggs. Where as 20 dollars in wizards unite gets you 10 keys...Niantic needs to do better here there is no excuse"

I dont dislike any of his new albums, they just arent as good as eminem show. Curtain call was amazing also"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fffoak6,t1_ffflny5,1579888238.0,"Thats not true, there are many artists who make a successful comeback and put out a great album. Linkin parks last album id put on par with meteora with how many great songs were on it. There wasnt a single song i didnt like. Kiss also made a huge comeback in the 90's, metallica made a comeback in 2008 after flopping for nearly 20 years. Weird al yankovic made a huge come back as a parody artist recently. You could add new kids on the block who made a TOP 20 song after being an irrelevant boy band for two decades."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fffhfy6,t1_fffdokc,1579884035.0,"Hes the same now as he was, hes just older and has a different image from his horror rap days that made him famous. Although there is no denying that em peaked at the eminem show and everything else since then has been weak in comparison. His last album wasnt too bad, but it still wasnt as amazing as people made it out to be."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fffh7gl,t1_fff171l,1579883889.0,"Dude eminem was despised when he started coming up. Yeah hes loved NOW because he earned it. Eminem was a fucking juggalo who wanted to work with ICP by handing them a fake flyer, they told him to fuck off so he started a beef with them. Majority of the songs off his early albums were distracks at celebrities who made fun of him. 

He went from marshal mathers, slim shady, to eminem and he had to prove himself to reach where he is.

The song ""Marshall Mathers"" has the best ICP burn in it, and i recommend listening to the entire song if you havent heard it. And since not many people here are old enough to remember early eminem, this is an [ICP interview](https://youtu.be/5lfwhPfBUgg) where they talk about why eminem started beefing with them. I beilive it also, because when he was young and coming up he started beefing with everyone he possibly could. Not many people liked him until he established his talent.

PrequelMemes,fff2vva,t1_ffdhm1b,1579874231.0,"The main argument i make between the prequels and sequels is that the sequels were not actually sequels but a reboot of the OT. Everything in the ST was just the same story, same characters, same build up and even the same ending. Whats sad is that the sequels could have actually been really good but disney was too busy whoring itself out to get a clear idea of what they were doing. 

Disney realized after solo that they cant keep pumping out star wars content every year like they can marvel movies, but realized it too late."

CNNmemes,ffcah5v,t1_ffc6bea,1579795213.0,"...ok.

To answer your question you should get your news from multiple sources and not just a single source. Any story you read, you should read it again from another website or network. Every network/blog/website will leave out information for various reasons, not all of them are malicious or deliberately deceiving. 

Information that was available at the time of the incident could have changed, or the sources might have been wrong.

Another source had a different contact and has information another network might not have.

Information is intentionally left out to skew an article in a left or right direction, or is overly sensitized to make its readers feel towards a certain way they normally wouldnt. 

I find that by reading multiple sources i get the best picture out of an event and can feel more confident in what im reading, this has also helped me see through bs yellow journalism and propaganda that most readers miss. I remember an article about trump from one of the major news outlets, maybe huffpost. Anyways it was saying he was guilty of a crime, then at the very end of the article it said ""while what he did wasnt actually illegal, many people on twitter still feel like it is."" And i immediately dismissed the entire article as bullshit just because of that and downvoted it."

AndroidGaming,ff52oq6,t1_ff3fsyh,1579578589.0,"With the unfinished games comment, some mobile games from small developers can excuse having an unfinished game that expands over time, so long as it works as intended."
AndroidGaming,ff52ll4,t1_ff39p11,1579578522.0,"Its gotten worse over the years with a lot of shit box developers coming out for cash grab apps. The point of their apps arent to provide entertainment, they are meant to generate as much money as possible with a shit ton of forced ads, tons of microtransactions, and a repetitive boring game that you can easily sink an hour or 2 into before you delete it.

There was one game i bought a ""remove ad"" option for because it was only 99cents and every time you died you got an ad. I paid the 99cents and i still got just as many ads. Contacted the developer and they ignored me and i never got a refund from the google store. Last time i ever installed a game from them, but i see their ads all over instagram and Facebook book and each game has millions of downloads. I noticed they pump a new one out every week also. 

Best thing you can do is find good developers and support the shit out of them because theyre the ones that dont profit as much as these scummy developers do. One example i can think of is-

Zombies run: a game that turns running/jogging/walking into an RPG experience where you collect supplies, build a base and complete hundreds of story missions. They also have virtual 5k's every year that are a lot of fun. Games been out for years and is constantly adding in new content, more missions and more events."

thanosdidnothingwrong,fepdkqf,t1_fepculy,1579317881.0,"Thanos from 2012 died, so in that timeline everything thanos did from 2012-2019 never happened, and since he never invaded earth or got the stones stark never died/went back in time. No thanos means infinity war never happened, and also gamora was the main reason the guardians all met and formed in the first place."
thanosdidnothingwrong,fepcbdi,t1_fep4zdn,1579317027.0,"Yes. There is a completely seperate timeline where tony stark is alive, and also has infinity stones.
