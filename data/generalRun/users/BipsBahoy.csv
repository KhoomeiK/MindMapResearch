TheyDidSurgeryOnGrape,fepvvt5,t1_fepu3mm,1579333188.0,"I don’t think I’ve ever thought that way. Sure, you will die one day. It is inevitable so there’s nothing to be worried of. 

There’s no way I can explain my thought process without also plunging myself into an existential crisis so I’m gonna just say this, 

You are never truly forgotten. Some random person on the street may remember you for some reason. Your family may remember you dearly and your one wish could be to never be forgotten. Fading out forgotten and alone is something we don’t know. We don’t know what happens after you die. It could all just go away or there could be some kinda afterlife. But who knows?

Think about life now and what life is about now. Dying happens to everyone and there’s no reason to fear it for make it a negative experience"

TheyDidSurgeryOnGrape,feptn9m,t1_fepmzgj,1579330878.0,"Well, it’s the mentality of a half glass full person. When you think “at least they won’t die alone” it gives a sense of security. Not a well thought out sense of security, but one in the most positive of a grim situation. I’d like to think, at least they died as friends. See? Even though you know two beings are dying, you know they lasted as having something many people strive to achieve but can’t; friends"
