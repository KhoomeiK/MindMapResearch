Sino,feui8zr,t1_fetrh6a,1579386789.0,"The most important thing to understand is the Marxism is supposed to be scientific, not a dogma. That means it changes based on material conditions and experimentation. Marx was a German writing about the conditions of western Europe in the 19th century, and he himself recognized this - for example, he didn't believe a socialist revolution, as he envisioned it, could happen in Russia. And he was right - the Russian revolution did not happen in the same way that Marx envisioned revolutions would happen in western Europe. It was adapted to Russia's different material conditions.

This is why it's called ""Socialism with Chinese Characteristics."" It's not a universal prescriptive model, it's a model for socialism adapted specifically to China's material conditions. Although many of its elements could also work in most other ""developing"" countries, should other countries adopt the ""Chinese model"" they will also make their own changes and adjustments wherever their country's conditions differ from China."

> As a sophomore, Kaczynski participated in a study described by author Alston Chase as a ""purposely brutalizing psychological experiment"" led by Harvard psychologist [Henry Murray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Murray). Subjects were told they would be debating personal philosophy with a fellow student, and were asked to write essays detailing their personal beliefs and aspirations. The essays were turned over to an anonymous [attorney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_at_law), who in a later session would confront and belittle the subject – making ""vehement, sweeping, and personally abusive"" attacks – using the content of the essays as ammunition, while [electrodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode) monitored the subject's physiological reactions. These encounters were filmed, and subjects' expressions of anger and rage were later played back to them repeatedly. The experiment lasted three years, with someone verbally abusing and humiliating Kaczynski each week. Kaczynski spent 200 hours as part of the study.


> Kaczynski's lawyers later attributed his hostility towards [mind control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_control) techniques to his participation in Murray's study. Some sources have suggested that Murray's experiments were part of [Project MKUltra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra), the [Central Intelligence Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency)'s research into mind control. Chase and others have also suggested that this experience may have motivated Kaczynski's criminal activities.
