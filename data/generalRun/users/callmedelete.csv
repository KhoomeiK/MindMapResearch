“Well-meaning pro-pitbull advocates once circulated a myth that Staffordshire terriers were used as nanny dogs in 19th century England. While pitbull-type dogs have been enjoyed by families for generations in both English and United States history, there’s no evidence that they actually cared for children like nannies.

There’s no such thing as a nanny dog.

No dog should be unattended with small children, or expected to tolerate tail-pulling, ear-grabbing and other abuse from toddlers. 

Pitbulls are known to love their family members of all ages, but only with supervision and training (of both children and dogs).”

Genetic temperament isn’t something you can “train away”. You can train good manners and a decent animal, but there is always the possibility of aggression coming through IF they are predisposed to it.

The idea that you can just “train bad or undesirable dispositions away” is such a dangerous idea. It’s the same line of thinking that people have when they buy a high content wolf dog thinking it’ll be their fucking ESA dog cause “iTs hOw YoU rAiSE tHeM”."
