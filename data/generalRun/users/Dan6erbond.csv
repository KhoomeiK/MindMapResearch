It's basically a wrapper you get from Banhammer.py that contains an actual PRAW object instance (like `submission`, `comment` or `modmail`) as well as some helper member attributes and functions that you can make use of when handling reactions/new items. 

Unfortunately I haven't gotten around to documenting that, though the rest of Banhammer.py's documentation can be found [here](https://ravianand.me/mariavi/banhammer-py.html) and I recommend you give the code a look."
