glassheads,fggyhpx,t1_fggby9b,1580772427.0,"Lemme tell you a story about the good ole laser kid. 

Laser kid was a dude in my college, and he dropped out after freshman year so I only knew him for a short bit. Maybe you can extract a bit of information about him from his name. He liked lasers. A lot. So much, in fact, that he ordered batteries/lenses/other parts online for the purpose of building lasers which were thousands of times as powerful as legally allowed. Dude loved burning shit in his room with his lasers. He was also a prostitute. 

Well, one day I go to the woods on our campus to rip my bong, and I find laser kid there with a few mutual friends. We proceed to initiate a session together. He hands me his bong, and I rip it... Not even a second after I began inhaling, I knew something was *very* wrong. It felt like I was inhaling a chemical weapon. 

I pull away from the bong with an unsmoked snap and a horrified face, asking him wtf was up. Laser kid goes ""oh yeah, there's everclear in there sorry for not givin you the heads up""

Everclear. In a fucking bong. Picture your harshest whiff of isopropyl alcohol and multiply that by 20 and breathe it deeper. 

So... Yeah if you're gonna do alcohol in a bong, at least limit it to beer. But that would suck so do use water, lol"

going off of your analogy: green was already important before we started talking about it. yellow was always unimportant. you are absolutely correct when you say ""i can also talk about yellow. that doesn't mean green is less important"" but only because how much we speak of something doesn't affect its importance. it's the other way around - something's importance should determine how much we speak about it.

AskReddit,fg25xxr,t3_ewcpzl,1580439026.0,"my girlfriend and i had broken up pretty recently, and it wasn't a clean break either, we were still pretty involved with each other. my then-friend tried to fuck her, sexually harassed her, and lied to me about it. 

i found out the details from my ex, and when i was discussing it with my friend, i told him to tell me what he did honestly. he gave one little detail, so i asked ""what else"" and he gave one more little detail. i asked ""what else"" again and he gave another little detail... still not the full story at all. this went on for a few minutes of me slowly coaxing the story out of him.

eventually i had heard enough and understood that he wasn't going to be honest with me. the one thing he didn't admit to me (or maybe there's more, maybe i never got the full details fro my ex) was when he was speaking to a mutual friend, and he said ""i know that she's marther's ex, but pussy is pussy, right?"" basically what that means is that he is aware of a moral imperative he has, and that he is willing to abandon that imperative for a sexual opportunity. what a fucking asshole. so yeah, not friends with him anymore.

im also not friends with my ex's roommate anymore (we were all a friend group at the time). the roommate always spoke of #metoo, holding men accountable for their actions, was generally very feminist, etc. after my ex got harassed by this guy, she asked her roommate if this person be not allowed in the room anymore, since he makes her uncomfortable and it's her safe space. so the roommate took this as being too ""restricted"" and just moved out, during her friend's time of need and in spite of the beliefs she spoke of. i thought that was horrible and did not want any part of that, so i'm not friends with her either."

bodyweightfitness,ffute1r,t3_evcbv0,1580248986.0,"first of all, don't do shallow pushups. kinda defeats the purpose of doing it, you want to improve *all* of your muscle, not just a limited part of it. you'll do fewer reps but that's okay, it's magnitudes better to have good form than a high number of reps.

PublicFreakout,ffu0pxx,t1_fftaoco,1580231980.0,"I agree that we should use precise language. But it was clear that someone was speaking informally, and they were taking to be speaking exactly, which isn't really fair to the person. It was obvious that they meant women receive few consequences for false accusations, not that they receive exactly 0 consequences.

All I'm saying is that just because there is an exception to a statement, doesn't mean that statement is necessarily made any less strong by those exceptions. It's undeniable that this is a social issue, and the difference between 0 women put in jail for false accusations and a few women put in jail for false accusations is not significant. Highlighting this difference does not bring light to anything else whatsoever.

Also, what I said was not a formulated argument. I was picking apart the previous comments, and when talking so semantically and precise as we are, it's hard to prevent things from being a bit jumbled."
PublicFreakout,ffta646,t1_fft7v0u,1580214090.0,"i mean yeah if we are gonna be all deductive and needlessly precise with our language (which nobody intended to do except for you, since when someone says ""no consequences"" in an informal conversation they obviously mean ""very few consequences""), then yeah, there is a non-zero amount of women who falsely accuse men of rape and get jail time. there's also a non-zero amount of people with hitchhiker's thumbs, a non-zero amount of females in the world, a non-zero amount of people with the world's rarest diseases, a non-zero amount of people who are addicted to eating soap, and.... anything other quantity greater than 0. that fact alone is almost meaningless.

well all know the false accusation of men by women is an ongoing social issue. who cares if the ridiculous statement ""for all women who falsely accuse men, exactly 0 are punished"" is false? nobody says that or believes that, and if you hop on someone who is purposely using informal language because they were imprecise, you aren't being receptive."

bodyweightfitness,ff3ghie,t1_ff2jrva,1579540548.0,"having your forearms locked off with your hands in the pronated grip (pullup grip) puts a lot of strain on the tendons in your elbow. this is where ""climber's elbow"" comes from, since their hands spend so much time in that position with tons of tension in their arm. as long as you don't massively overdo your pullups, you should be fine. if you feel pain in your elbows, you should probably rest until it goes away.

pullups can definitely injure your shoulders if you do them wrong. when your hands are in the pronated grip, it causes your shoulders to rotate externally, which puts a lot of tension on your rotator cuff. you can reduce this by arching your back and trying to hit the bar with your chest (this gives you better muscle activation anyway). you can also mix it up with neutral grip pullups or chinups, since they don't cause your shoulders to rotate externally."

MathJokes,fegx6yf,t1_fegnkif,1579104538.0,"this is why i like to say that physics is the language of the universe, and math is the grammar of that language."
MathJokes,fegx483,t1_fegdp3a,1579104488.0,i think it's more accurate to say that our reality is shaped by concepts which we describe with math - not that reality is shaped by math.
Ocarina,fegwphw,t1_fefvzsx,1579104225.0,"well, you could transpose it to make it ""sound correct"" but that is to the standard of playing the exact same pitches.

if you wanted to, you could use the same fingerings and it will still sound ""good"" except in a different key."
mathpics,fefic6j,t3_eok2iq,1579056926.0,"Hey, this looks *very* similar to some research I was doing about some drawing machines. I'm not sure if you have heard of a pintograph, but when the arms of one are arranged in a certain way and placed infinitely far away, the output converges to an image *suspiciously* similar to a 2D projection of the donut shape shown. Adjusting the parameters of the machine affected the output in a very similar way to what happens when different points on the sphere are selected. Let me know if you want to know more."

Buddhism,fe86f0v,t1_fe7fy48,1578923055.0,"clearly, starbucks believes the two are mutually exclusive. or at least, that a mindfulness app would help employees to accept and be grateful for a wage too small to support them."
Buddhism,fe868jz,t1_fe6sirj,1578923003.0,"agreed. the company is essentially requesting that the employees be more mindful, which usually entails being more generally accepting and grateful. obviously, the company is doing absolutely nothing to be more accepting of hardships, or to be more grateful for what it has - if it was, then the employees would be getting paid more.

but no, the employees have to take care of the company's shit, while the company won't take care of the employees' shit."
TrueOffMyChest,fdy6l01,t1_fdwxpk3,1578776596.0,"all of these are irritating but they aren't especially *visually* displeasing, which is heavily implied by the word ugly. they are repulsive on a more of a conceptual level.

anyways, i should have been more clear: are there any fashion choices that you find ugly?"
TrueOffMyChest,fdwrv0m,t1_fdwjp9c,1578761764.0,is there anything a person could do that would make themselves look ugly to you? just curious.

TrueOffMyChest,fdwiwzr,t1_fdwc9ol,1578759118.0,how is it self important? i guess the only part that could be interpreted that way is that they believe people with long nails are not worth caring about... but i think that's a bit different than a belief about oneself
TrueOffMyChest,fdwinrn,t1_fdweckg,1578759032.0,"probably because they think it to themselves when they see long nails in person but have nobody to say it to without sounding like an asshole, so it gets bottled up and then they rant about it here.

source: i've ranted about tiny things here before because i don't want to be mean to anyone in real life by shitting on something they like, even if it's fucking stupid"
