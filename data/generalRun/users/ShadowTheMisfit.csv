Is the gun unbalanced? Yes and No.

As I mentioned in the previous comment, it is easily countered, and if you have the early advantage it wont do well, but if it has the turbocharger, then yes I would consider it pretty OP. It doesnt have much drop-off so it's pretty good for short-mid range engagements, but it's not consistent after around 25 meters.

It's pretty much like all guns, it really just depends on attachments, cause that's what makes it better than most weapons, is that it has some of the best attachments. Extended mags are great cause it's an LMG, Turbocharger is great for obvious reasons, barrel stabilizer is good for the longer fights. It really just depends. People have had negative experiences with it, and let that affect their whole perspective of the gun.

So is it unbalanced? As much as any other gun with the right attachments."
apexlegends,fdmgptd,t1_fdmfqoc,1578549315.0,"No. I find it in 1 out of 4-5 games anyways, so it's a joy to use as I dont use it ALL the time, it's just preferred recently. Everyone makes the same argument for the PK. They use their overpowered gun, I use mine. And without a turbocharger, it's horrible when you dont have the advantage at the beginning of the firefight. You cant get mad at something you have no control over. You telling me how ""broken"" the gun is wont make me think to myself ""wow I want to give my opponents an advantage over me"" I will use a gun I enjoy, and you do the same, friend. I wont judge.
