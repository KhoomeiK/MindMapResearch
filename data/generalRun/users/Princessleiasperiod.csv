unpopularopinion,ffppdwx,t3_eudkd4,1580101143.0,I am homeless. I live in a shelter. I have met some amazing people and met some who act like we are the scum of the planet. In some states its illegal to feed the homeless. We are just like you. Some of us have gotten here because of drugs or violence or simply because we are down on our luck. Sometimes people fall through the cracks. The worst part for me is sometimes its the people you call family who end up letting you down.

silenthill,ff2ve5o,t3_ercr7x,1579525642.0,I love your ideas. I think making the town completely explorable would be awesome. All interiors open including woods surrounding the town. We could even explore brahms which is oft mentioned in the series. There could be a new level of interactivity within the series. They could incorporate alternate realities and worlds as well.  You could have the ability to construct weapons and really incorporate the environment to aid you in your journey. Most importantly keeping the feeling of isolation present at all times. Maybe we could even go co op where friends can drop in and you can team up on different tasks that can only be completed with two people or more.

AskReddit,feweph1,t3_eqouu3,1579409351.0,I was concerned about the lack of feminine products on the death star. What if princess leia had gotten her period on a predominantly male populated vessel would she be accomodated? What if during her interrogation as to where the plans were she started getting cramps and mood swings? Could make for an awkward situation with the emperor and darth vader.

silenthill,fcuk8ju,t1_fcucqoq,1577982884.0,I cannot play sh with out getting legitamley scared and paranoid. I think psychological horror is so much more effective. Its the first game i cannot play in the dark with the volume up. It gets inside your head. The fact that you cant see anything beyond your flashlight is very unerving. The static from the radio permeates the silence and darkness but you cant see whats coming for you. Only that its there and its watching you. In sh2 when pyramid head is stalking you through the apartments is one of the creepiest experience in a game ive ever had.

You were nervous and lacked self confidence. You were in a brand new situation and you got stage fright. It happens to everyone. Talk to her dont shut down. Explain yourself own that shit and when u get a second chance go very slow. Let her take the lead and allow yourself to get comfortable. You cant just hop in a car and drive if you dont know how. Your starting from square one. Plus attraction and love is so much more than sex. Trust me. Get to know her and her body. Learn to please her first. Be a giving and kind lover. Itll be ok.
