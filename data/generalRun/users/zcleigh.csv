TrueAskReddit,fe36zc4,t3_ejhufw,1578846539.0,I think a more interesting question is: who would be the next Cain?
college,fe306vo,t3_eno0vm,1578844703.0,"Grew up in Atlanta and wound up attending classes at University of Alaska Fairbanks due to being moved by the Army.  

Fairbanks has a total population of like 35K

The school was like 2.5K.... maybe

Most people are either drawn to cities or small towns.  Some people do well in both.  I am a firm believer that the people who do well in both are the individuals that are at peace with the thought of being alone.  It's an important skill.  Right now might be a good time for you to look into that.  When you're alone what makes you happy? Take the time to explore options and find out what truly makes you happy.  You may wind up loving it.  You may also find out that you truly are a city girl and that's okay too. 

Either way I wish you the best of luck."

I may be biased though.  Since starting college I've been doing online classes about half of the time due to military training and deployments.  The combination of school and moving from place to place may just create so many events that it makes time feel slower."
college,fdym9kl,t1_fdldscb,1578781285.0,"I was the same way in high school.   Breezed through without trying.  Got to college and got smacked with the harsh reality that I'm not as smart as I thought I was.

My dad would always ask me what my grades were at the end of every semester.  He's not a very reasonable human being, so I lied to him every time... 8 semesters in a row.  My mom would ask too.  The issue there was I knew she would understand and continue to be supportive, but I lied to her anyway so she wouldn't tell my dad.  

I know what you're going through there... it sucks. If i could go back to that first semester I would change a lot of things (tbh though... would still probably lie about the grades even though it has caused an enormous amount of guilt).  

I am not the type to beat around the bush.  I will speak to you honestly with no sugar coating.  My recommendation to you is try harder.  We both know you're smart.  I don't know what you did with your free time, but if you're like the average 18 year old fresh out of mommy and daddy's house, you played video games, had crushes and ""heartbreaks,"" partied/hung out with friends.  We know this strategy didn't work.  Next semester put your face in the book.  Go to class early and stay late to get help.  Look up videos of the subject matter on YouTube.  When you find the level of effort you need to put in in order to get the desired grade, then your next task is to try to balance it with personal life.  This next semester though, grind with everything you have and get it done properly.  You'll look back years from now and be more proud of yourself than you will be when you look at the next semesters grade book and see straight A's.  You'll be proud not because of the great job that you did, but because it was the first step in becoming an adult.

Best of luck."
college,fdyj782,t3_enbuma,1578780362.0,"I'm not sure if you meant for your last sentence to come across as it did (at least to me), but community college is not a bad option.  It's cheaper than a 4 year university 99% of the time.  As long as its accredited, the course should transfer to state institutions with no issues.  You have the opportunity to improve the GPA that the 4 year college will evaluate for your transfer request.  Lastly, if I'm not mistaken, colleges generally don't look at or require SAT/ACT scores for transfer students.

No lies, it's going to be extremely hard if not impossible for you to get into an accredited 4 year university.  If you are absolutely set on starting at a 4 year, my recommendation would be find a state where the national guard is affiliated with a state university

I.E. Georgia National Guard = UNG, Alaska National Guard = UAA or UAF, etc.

You can join the national guard and serve your country,  get some work experience on your resume,  make a bit of money, guard will pay for your school, and depending on the state, you'll be guaranteed admission at select universities.  

Best of luck."
