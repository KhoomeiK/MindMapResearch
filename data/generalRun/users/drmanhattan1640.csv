I just want to state again that the women being emotion quote is **not** my view. 

I can't say this with certainty as i am not a woman and my understanding of what they feel isn't necessarily correct but my impression is they are in general more sociable than their male counterparts) but that doesn't mean that all of them like that you yourself and many more i am sure are an exception to that yet the percentage is in women's favor which results in more posts from men than women complaining.

Have a wonderful day/night."
offmychest,ffc0bbh,t3_eso5v1,1579788249.0,"Well of course, women have it just as hard. anybody who has a little bit of reason would agree on that.

What i think you might have overlooked in your argument is the medium.  Because women can say that they are emotionally upset or having a hard time without that affecting how society view them (or at least to a degree far lesss then men) because every body expect women to be emotional ( that's not my view, i don't believe that, i am just stating the popular and coincidentally wrong social viewpoint),  having salary gap,unfair work conditions and so on. And there's already a voiced and politically strong movement which fights against that for women. And my experience from my female friends ( they are more probable to open up, especially to their female friends) so they have outlets to voice these feelings.

But if a man said something similar he would be viewed ad less masculine, weak and beta individual ( whatever that means)  so alot of men find solace in the anonymity of reddit to voice their hurt feelings and deepest regrets. For example there are things I am willing to say on reddit that I can't say to a living soul.  Maybe my mother, but that's it, not my father, not my gf, not my 10-years friend. That's why you see those post  with more frequency from men. It's our only haven.


PS: I hope, everything works out for you and you find whatever that makes you happy."
confession,fel8m32,t3_epjdeh,1579216427.0,"I don't know if you're religious or not but let's imagine that your father is looking upon you from heaven. What doe you think he feels right now? Is he angry with you because you stole like $100 from him 10-20 years ago or just worry about you, how sad you are sometimes or how he wish he was there to help deal with the hardship of your lives. 

Don't dwell on such small things, live your life in a way, that you know your father will be proud of. He seems to have been a hard-working man. Be like that and (if you have a family/when you have a family), take care of them and love them as much as you can.

Not just for you or your family but for your father,  the man who loved his family and would love nothing more than you being happy."

ExperiencedDevs,fdlandd,t1_fdkbfav,1578519983.0,"That's a big assumption on your part, who told you that OP isn't happy with his/her life or that he/she doesn't travel. OP might be living with his/her mom simply because he enjoys her company and want her is his/her life.

I really hate it that we all have this template lifestyle that we want to stuff up the mouth of every bachelor on earth."
ExperiencedDevs,fdavx20,t3_ekenhi,1578250939.0,"Sounds like you need a move but no need to panic. Yes you maybe not familiar with TDD, good programming practices but you HAVE experience and you are self aware of your shortcomings that means with a bit of reading and six month of work in a more relative company. You would be just the same as anybody else in that company."

Just one thing, even if you tell someone that you have no intentions of anything serious, men hearts tend to cling if you were a nice person. I am not saying lyou have any commitments toward them or anything, just try be careful of hurting other people's feeling as a way of being a nice person."
