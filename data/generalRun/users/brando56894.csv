I've been going for about 4 months and IDK if it's really working. After like 3 months I finally told him that I feel like this isn't working and we never really focus on what I originally came to him for. He said ""well what do you suggest we do about this?"" And I shrugged my shoulder and told him IDK and that's why I came to him in the first place. This was only about 2 weeks ago, and I skipped my appointment last week to hang out with a friend I haven't seen in a while.

He doesn't really fall under any of the categories why I should fire him, except that he does tend to talk about his relating experiences a lot, and our session is only 45 minutes and our schedule isn't consistent; but then again I don't really fall into any of the categories of ""it's working"": I don't dread going there, it's not really that difficult for me to talk about, etc...

I guess I'll give him another month or two and see how it progresses from there."
