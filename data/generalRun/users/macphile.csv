I've watched Voyager 2.5 times to your ~0.5, for instance. Yet I couldn't bring myself to finish Enterprise. Lots of people hate Neelix, but you like him (I'm fine with him, and he improves as the series goes on). I agree that Chakotay needs to be excised from the series, like all of his scenes just surgically removed like what Topher (?) did with Jar-Jar...yet I've also seen people say they love him. Some people love what they did to the Klingons in Discovery. I don't. Some people adore Tilly. I don't. I'm reasonably optimistic about Picard, insofar as I temper my expectations--it's not going to be TNG, and it wouldn't be realistic to expect that. If it's well written and entertaining, I'm fine.

Unrelated but related...I have a fantastic coffee table-style book on cruises. Like from the earliest ""cruise"" ships to today, documenting the rise of ""pleasure"" cruises (as opposed to just transportation). The changes are such a wonder. As much as people have a go at Carnival, for instance, people 100 years ago would shit themselves at the sight of it. The first onboard pool was an oiled skin full of water, stretched across pegs--literally a bag of water that you basically sat in. No A/C, no heat. Your only entertainment was ballroom dancing or reading a book, basically. And of course, only the wealthy could afford it.

Anyway, the counterargument was that for centuries, travel and experiencing other cultures was a luxury solely for the rich (or sailors, I guess, who often died). Most people never left their hometowns. Heck, hundreds of years of my family lived within the same 10-mile radius, per our research. One of the greatest changes that happened was not only developing air travel but making it affordable for a lot of people. We can easily move to other places, visit other lands, experience new things, see the wonders of the world...all because flying is *cheap*.

So of course, we all complain about how much the ticket is, or how much the baggage fee is...or whatever. For a machine that gets you halfway across the US in a few hours with an eye-wateringly impressive safety record. The bastards.

Of course, this is more about planes than about airports, although there's an amazingly obvious relationship between the two.

So it's basically an airline-supplied pillow fort. It also comes with its own seatbelt set-up so you can comply with the need for a belt.

It costs a bit more than an economy plus-style seat. Having said which, as fun as it looks, I'd probably still end up booking a ""plus"" when I go.
