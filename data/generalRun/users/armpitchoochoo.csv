This is the key part of the issue and it is where you are wrong. This kind of thing has been studied on multiple occasions. Here's what the Canadian Paediatrics Society has to say on the matter at this kind of age group.

""Most children have a strong sense of their gender identity by the time they are 4 years old. Here is what you can typically expect at different ages:

2 to 3 years old:
At around 2 years old, children are aware of physical differences between boys and girls.
Most children can identify themselves as a “boy” or “girl”, although this may or may not match the sex they were assigned at birth.
Some children’s gender identity remains stable over their life, while others may alternate between identifying themselves as “boy” or “girl”, or even assume other gender identities at different times (sometimes even in the same day). This is normal and healthy.
 
4 to 5 years old:
While many children at this age have a stable gender identity, gender identity may change later in life.
Children become more aware of gender expectations or stereotypes as they grow older. For example, they may think that certain toys are only for girls or boys.
Some children may express their gender very strongly. For example, a child might go through a stage of insisting on wearing a dress every day, or refusing to wear a dress even on special occasions.""

By the time children are at the age that this kid is, they know about gender. This school is helping them understand it better, and more importantly, teaching them that gender doesn't matter"
worldnews,fgl9uts,t1_fgl77bv,1580887401.0,"I did read the article. People joined his protest and because of that, some content was modified. But overall it was deemed as appropriate for that age group by people who's job it is to figure that out. Not some random parent.

From a legal perspective, certain names are required to avoid discrimination. But from a human perspective the correct sentence is ""person A is a woman"" and the response is ""okay, cool."""
worldnews,fgl9hpq,t1_fgl8998,1580886953.0,"I would definitely feel the same way, that the child should attend school. If I disagreed with the curriculum then I would challenge the government to change it.

He has the right to say, absolutely, but he does not have the right to deny his child's right to an education.

He does not get to avoid it. The child is being forced to miss all the other subjects as well because his father disagrees with this one. The child is also missing out on socialization skulls and quite ironically, will probably be treated differently when he returns because of this break.

Nobody thinks that changing their gender suddenly frees them from moral obligations.

Changing genders is one of the hardest things that someone can do, the discrimination and hate that they face is incredible. They certainly don't do it lightly so they can manipulate the system.

Also, the idea of gender IS divorced from biological realities. Nobody thinks they are a different biological sex"

But one persons opinion should not sway policy and curriculum, that's not how democracy works.

worldnews,fgh3v8g,t1_fgewjv7,1580776068.0,"[Here is a great write up](https://www.cbc.ca/cbcdocspov/m_features/canadas-gender-identity-rights-bill-c-16-explained) about the legislation that you are talking about. It features 2 lawyers that specialize in that area.

The TLDR is that the law doesn't mention pronouns anywhere. It merely adds sexual orientation and expression into the list of areas protected from discrimination.

It mentions that merely calling someone by the wrong pronoun would not constitute harassment. “The misuse of gender pronouns, without more, cannot rise to the level of a crime,” she says. “It cannot rise to the level of advocating genocide, inciting hatred, hate speech or hate crimes … (it) simply cannot meet the threshold.”

“Would it cover a situation where an individual repeatedly, consistently refuses to use a person’s chosen pronoun? It might.”

If that was then deemed as harassment (and that's the key here, not just using the wrong pronoun but purposely harassing someone by doing it) then it would likely rule in the complainants favor resulting in a posible monetary payment and possible things like sensitivity training. If they then ignored the courts ruling they could be sent to prison for contempt of court but not for the act itself.

The Ontatio Human Rights Commission (the federal government says that it is expected to follow the provincial commissions) states ""Generally, when in doubt, ask a person how they wish to be addressed. Use ‘they’ if you don’t know which pronoun is preferred. Simply referring to the person by their chosen name is always a respectful approach.”"

Cricket,fds9x1d,t1_fds7m5y,1578697729.0,"I appreciate your response, you shouldn't be downvoted for it.

Based on your comment history I can assume that you are heading into university/college so please allow me to give you a small suggestion, you can choose to take it or ignore it, it's up to you. If somebody doesn't understand the point that you are trying to make (based on other people's comments it appears I'm not the only one that did not read it the way it was supposedly intended) then that is on you for not presenting it in a clear and concise manner. When you will be asked to present your work in further education, blaming the person for reading it wrong will get you exactly nowhere. In fact, forget the education system, in life itself, the moment you attack the other person the conversation is over, they won't have any interest in listening to your opinion.

Cricket,fdrt7i6,t3_emu406,1578689405.0,"I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with the opinion as a whole but the points in your argument are extremely flawed.

You're attribution of a rating out of ten for each player is just your opinion and therefore irrelevant to any actual comparison between the 4.

Your list of ODI players that are better than him is again just your opinion. Not a good argument to make. 

Your listing of his rank and rating is what you should be focusing on. Use numbers and statistics to back your argument. You began to use them well there but didn't do enough.

To properly make your argument you should list the ratings and ranking of each player in each format. Probably should bring in averages and strike rates as well.

You have a decent hypothesis, I think quite a lot of people will agree with it, but you could have backed it up with a much better argument than just your opinion of his rating"

America is ranked 13th in freedom according to the Human Freedom Index, something that specifically ranks countries based on the freedoms of their citizens. Canada and Australia? They are tied for 6th. You have far less freedoms than you think. Stop believing the propoganda"
pics,fdooo76,t1_fdokxb3,1578609467.0,"But your government already is the final arbitrator. They are the ones making and enforcing the laws. Governments are the people too. America was founded on democracy actually, people representing the people in governance. Do you think Canada has a dictator? Australia, UK, Scandinavia? Letting your government run Healthcare does not make a country an autocracy, in fact their democracies are more intact than yours is. Businesses are still functioning just fine in those countries, their economies are great. Business does not suffer because of government run health care"
pics,fdo2pne,t1_fdnl9ma,1578597802.0,"It is true actually, they just finished a study on it. All services are cheaper. In fact it's the high quality ones that end up being cheaper by the most as they cost you the same as any low cost service. The only difference in terms of care is that we have to wait longer for elective surgeries. Priority is given to emergency cases (as it should) instead of who can just pay for it.

Giving governments control does not mean turning a country into an autocracy. Your government has control right now. Businesses are not free to do whatever they want (which is a good thing) because the government regulates them. Your governments control entities such as emergency services and they run just fine, can you imagine what would happen if your police force was owned by a company. Would that company ever be charged with anything?

Again your government has control of things now and it's not some communist autocracy. Giving complete control to businesses would be a disaster.

As someone who lives it every day, I am telling you, government run healthcare is awesome. If I get into a car accident tomorrow, I don't have to worry about paying for an ambulance, paying for the surgery, the anesthetic, the surgeon, worrying about my insurance accepting my claim, suing them when they don't (happens all the time). I don't have to worry about anything, I'm completely looked after."
pics,fdnk8g9,t1_fdniqqf,1578587545.0,"Of course it's not free from cost, everybody knows it comes out of your taxes. But did you know that Canadian Healthcare is 4 times cheaper per person than the US Healthcare. Mainly because it doesn't have to go through as many steps because there arent as many greedy fingers in the pot. There is no current way to compare quality of overall healthcare between the 2 countries but there doesn't seem to be any real difference from what is out there. 

Your ""choices"" are just mandated to you by companies rather than the government (which still has laws on healthcare regulations anyway). The difference is that Canada has oversight while your companies can run wild as is seen by your ridiculous costs which are causing people to be bankrupted or literally just die because they can't afford a simple procedure or medication. There is a reason that people are travelling to Canada just to get much needed, life saving medication.

Your idea of freedom is misplaced. Libertarianism has never worked. Society relies on government, without it we wouldn't be where we are today. That doesn't mean that everything the government does is good, but that doesn't mean that everything that it does is bad either. Countries with government led healthcare have extremely successful healthcare that you could learn from."
Cricket,fdne4ty,t1_fdmru83,1578583865.0,"Another part of this though is whether a player who has left the field of play is eligible to field the ball. Once he steps over the rope he has left the field, which is why it's been interpreted in the past as they have to step back in before touching it. I haven't looked yet but there may be another law involved in this instance above and beyond the catching law.

Either way this law clearly needs to be rewritten in a more succinct way and possibly changed. This is a dangerous precedent and will lead to players jumping up and down multiple times outside of the rope before bringing it back in"
