Despite everything one thing you do have on your hands is your youth. You can start over and over again. When you are older few people will have the patience for your changing goals and unstable identity. 

Even when you feel really bad and can't believe that the feeling is only temporary, remember this, you won't be 21 forever - that part is not temporary - and that's a good and a bad thing. You're free. You can do anything and be anyone. Get a bursary to study in Brazil or Hungary. Teach English in Korea. Join Habitats for Humanity and build shelters in Burkina Faso. Depression can be lifelong but when you find your mental load is lighter, grab life by horns and do everything you can to enrich your life. I hope you feel better soon."
CrossStitch,ff015ut,t3_eql4d8,1579464039.0,What was he talking about? Lol. I watched this series but don't remember this.
SuicideWatch,fez5idx,t3_eqwgtv,1579453999.0,"I had the same thoughts at 21. I did meds and therapy. Now I'm 29. It's like the credits have been rolling since I was  21. My life has been over since then. Everyone was trying to convince me its going to be fine. Some bits were, I guess. But today I find myself on this sub. Funny thing that."
SuicideWatch,fez18vf,t1_felxfqi,1579452970.0,I'm glad you have hope now. How did you end up in the psych ward?
blursedimages,fekp4x7,t1_fekka9b,1579204698.0,Life is a blessing.
houseplants,fekoxov,t3_epoalr,1579204579.0,It's nice. At what size did you get it? Will you eventually plant it outside?
Catholicism,fc4w4ry,t3_eg7sxr,1577430864.0,"As omegajams said, we are not discussing LGBT and abortion all day long. I have probably only heard the priest mention these topics 2 or 3 times in all the years that I have been to Mass. How many times has he mentioned the commandments? How many times has me mentioned that Jesus died for our sins? How many times has he mentioned that Jesus commandes us to love one another? A whole lot more than 2 or 3 times.

I do not know how many people are gay at church. Would I treat them differently? Of course not! Is homosexuality in contradiction with what the Bible say? Yes. Trans? Absolutely, definitely. Does it mean I will seek to offend my people who are lbgt and make them feel sad? Nope. I don't know what will happen to any of us but  I know God will forgive them, just as he forgives me for all the things I have done."
