Housing in the nice parts of town is expensive. I would go for Berlin personally. It’s supposed to be a really cool and very diverse city."
expats,fgif0z8,t1_fggp143,1580819489.0,I guess you lucked out. Mine was mediocre at best. I had a way better experience in college.
germany,fgicqwa,t3_cz7271,1580817015.0,"I’m not German, but l live in Heidelberg so I can give you an expat point of view.

Most people speak English, at least around the city center. I’ve also found Germans here very tolerant when you are learning German and friendly towards foreigners.

Frankfurt is a big airport and makes it easy to travel.

However, I think Heidelberg is expensive for what you get. It’s a beautiful city and there are lots of nice places to go hiking, but as someone who has always lived in big cities, I find it pretty boring. I don’t think the food is that great, especially international food. If I you are a student and interested in nightlife, you might find it more interesting. Or if you are interested in more of a small town kind of environment. Most of the expats I know are very happy here, but personally I would go for a bigger city."
expats,fghzsh5,t1_fgham0r,1580799311.0,"I honestly think the emphasize in social activities will be hard for my niece. She’s used to school focusing on academics and she’s not very socially confident. Maybe it would be good for her, but I feel it’s hard to predict."
expats,fghzlop,t1_fggyj8v,1580799106.0,"I think my niece is already set on going to university in the US and I hope she doesn’t. I don’t think it’s worth the cost. We can’t tell right now if sending her for this exchange program will break her obsession with America or just feed it. I’m proud of where I grew up, but after living in Europe for a number of years I have to say that the social protections here have completely changed the quality of my life. But I’ve noticed a lot of my younger nieces and nephews in Europe are very infatuated with American culture and have this naive idea that they will move there and instantly be popular, successful, and wealthy."
work,fggwagj,t3_eyfkdh,1580770987.0,I think you’re right go ask for a car or try and negotiate a salary increase. I would do the math. How much would the extra gas cost per month and how many miles per month. Use that to calculate what the estimate cost would be per year. I don’t know how you’d calculate the extra miles on your car a year but there must be a depreciated value associated with miles. See if you can figure it out.
exchangestudents,fggo10y,t1_fgfvr4p,1580765849.0,I think it would be great if she could go to a school with more exchange students.
exchangestudents,fggnxwi,t1_fgfykv7,1580765798.0,I’m glad you had a positive experience. I hope if she does end up going she’ll enjoy it as much as you did.
exchangestudents,fggnr60,t1_fgfw8w7,1580765687.0,"You are right about Americans being friendly and open minded, but they can also be really snobby and judgmental. I say this as an American that did go high school in the US. Girls her age can be very quick to ostracize someone who seems different. I know it’s not like that everywhere and she could have a great experience, but I don’t think it’s a guarantee and I’m trying to help her family decide if it’s worth spending that much money."
exchangestudents,fggneu9,t1_fgf5qxv,1580765484.0,"Thanks for all your insight. I think she could have a good experience if she is placed in the right environment, but I think my main fear is that she’s only chasing some idea she has about American culture, based entirely on this Hollywood/celebrity fantasy of what it is actually like. Maybe it would be good for her to see what it’s really like, but I’m afraid my sister in law will spend €10,000 for her to feel uncomfortable and want to come home."
exchangestudents,fggn0n1,t1_fgevgq5,1580765251.0,"I’m not trying to put her down. She’s a very smart and hard working kid. But she’s also not someone that is confident in social situations. Maybe this experience will help her, but maybe it will be tough and she won’t enjoy it."
expats,fggkkr5,t1_fggj2nh,1580763805.0,I lived in Kansas City for some time. I enjoyed it. But honestly I think she has no ideas that there are places in the US that aren't like California or aren't like what she sees on TV. I grew up in California and would not even say that my school life was cool or exciting or even looked remotely like what you see in the media.
expats,fggkbhw,t1_fgfw249,1580763652.0,"Me too. That's what I did. But a lot of her friends are preoccupied with American life, celebrities, Hollywood, etc. Its her dream to experience American high school."
expats,fggk8i4,t1_fgfdcp9,1580763602.0,"Thanks for your feedback. You are right, maybe going to high school in the US will reset her fantasies about American culture. I'm hoping they can at least find a less expensive program."
expats,fggk3pr,t1_fgf9io8,1580763524.0,That's a good point. It could push her out of her shell a little.
expats,fggk27b,t1_fgew6cw,1580763499.0,"Hope I can convince her to do something like this. I would so much rather go to camp than high school, but then I grew up in the US know that high school is not exactly what you see on tv."
expats,fggjxhk,t1_fgeryz1,1580763421.0,"Thanks. I never even thought of this, but its a good idea. I don't know if she realizes that summer camps are a big part of American culture, but personally I think she'd gain more from something like that."
expats,fggjufr,t1_fgequl5,1580763371.0,"At the moment she's very attached to experiencing what US high schools are like, but I think something like this would be a better idea. I'll look into it and see if we can steer her in that direction instead."

expats,fggjiyu,t1_fgdekq4,1580763181.0,"Thanks for your advice. Its nice to hear some positive experiences. I think she would benefit from spending time in another culture, but I'm worried she only wants to go to the US because of what she thinks it will be like, based on what she sees in movies. But it sounds like if she finds the right program, she could really gain a lot from the experience, even if it turns out to be nothing like what she imagines."
expats,fggj3sw,t1_fgf74sw,1580762932.0,She has done a summer English immersion program already. I agree with you. I did an exchange program in Europe when I was in college and I think I appreciated being a different culture more at that age.
expats,fggiuxx,t1_fgf695f,1580762785.0,"I think her mom feels like if she does not support her, it will only feed her obsession with the US."
expats,fggip3t,t1_fgejaml,1580762688.0,"That's what I think as well. I went to high school in the US and what I remember the most about her age is how mean and snobby girls were. I know not all are like that, but at the time it really felt like that sometimes. I think for her its more about experiencing what she sees on tv. High schools that look like castles, cheerleaders, football games, etc."
expats,fggijtb,t1_fgd3cbh,1580762599.0,"Thanks for giving me your perspective as a host. It sounds like a great idea to have another kid her age placed at the same time. I'll recommend my sister in law ask about this. My niece is pretty responsible so I think she would do fine with the independence. I think what I am most worried about is that she has built these exaggerated ideas about American life, but maybe it would be good for her to see what its really like. I can't say that my own upbringing was any more exciting than her own, but I guess when you see the US from the outside, based on what you see through Hollywood, it could seem like a more glamorous place to be."
expats,fggi0zz,t1_fgcrkza,1580762290.0,"I would say that she's both naturally introverted and shy. She likes to travel and experience new things, but my main concern is that she's going after something she sees in Hollywood movies, which isn't really what high school is like. I don't think she sees the potential for feeling like an outsider or feeling overwhelmed or insecure in a different environment. But you are right, having someone guide her through would probably make the experience worthwhile. Its just hard to know ahead of time if she'll have that ."
expats,fgghnuv,t1_fgcrzzy,1580762072.0,Thanks for giving a positive impression. My niece does well academically and is serious about school and not much of a risk taker so I don't think she'd get involved in the wrong crowd. Her main motivation is that she wants to know what it is like to go to high school in the US.
expats,fgghag4,t1_fgcn7pc,1580761852.0,That's helpful to know. I'll mention to my sister in law that she should ask about this. My niece is very shy so it would be helpful to have another kid  her age.
expats,fggh5db,t1_fgdmdbw,1580761769.0,"Yes, I'm not sure why this program is so expensive."
expats,fggh4ck,t1_fgcpsu8,1580761752.0,"True, it could benefit her to see that life is not as perfective and exciting as it might seem on TV."
expats,fggh1mt,t1_fgcp5wt,1580761708.0,I'm just not sure if she's in this to to experience something new or if she's in this because she has this fantasy about what American life is like. But I guess the potential to open her eyes is not a bad thing.

Anxiety,fg66zal,t1_fg4oe57,1580556844.0,"I’m sure getting more used to his apartment will help. Do things that will help you feel like more than a guest, like cooking together, take a shower in his bathroom, or stash a few of your comfort foods in his kitchen. You can even bring one of your own blankets over, or at least a robe or a stuffed animal, something that you can use for extra comfort."
Advice,fg5yxag,t3_ex1nr5,1580545058.0,"It sounds like her parents have fostered an inflated sense of talent, beauty, importance, etc in your niece. If she can’t handle losing one game, she’s going to be in for it when she realizes that these delusions that her parents have painted are unrealistic at best. Even if she did have all the natural talent and beauty in the world, these are still extremely competitive and demanding fields and she would have to be capable both of working hard AND tolerating rejection. I wouldn’t worry about your niece hating you. I would worry that her parents aren’t setting her up for a healthy and successful life."
relationship_advice,fg5pvj8,t3_ewusxw,1580534624.0,"I think he’s probably painted a picture that anyone reacting to this is full of dramatics. That way he doesn’t have to take responsibility for his actions. He’s probably waiting for things to blow over and for you to “get over it.”

Maybe instead of expressing your feelings to your dad, which he’s obviously dismissed, you can express facts: it’s extremely inappropriate that he chose to build a relationship with his niece directly after leaving your mother. She’s not his blood family, but she certainly is yours and your mothers. He’s selfishly ignored how this has affected your life and you’ve decided that he can no longer be in yours. Keep it short, stick to facts, and say goodbye.

He’ll have a much harder time justifying himself if you are straight with him. It might not change the situation, but I think it gives you a stronger case as you walk away."

Anxiety,fg4ncph,t3_ewr4re,1580506897.0,"Some of my worst anxiety has been during times when I was really unhappy in jobs. Work always has stressful moments, but sometimes the environment becomes toxic, especially for someone sensitive to stress. It could be that the dynamics at her job are not right for her and she needs a healthier and more stable work environment."
Anxiety,fg4lt1i,t3_ewsbhm,1580505945.0,It’s natural to feel scared but I think it will get easier with time. I use an app that has different rain sounds if I’m overstressed and it helps calm me down enough to sleep. You could try something like that. Or spend some more time during the day at his house and in his bed. Make the space feel more familiar and safe.
work,fg48jhi,t1_fg3h1lg,1580498418.0,Depends on the person. It seems in this case your supervisor doesn’t think he’s taken seriously or have authority. When people overreact about things it says more about them then you.

In my experience someone that jumps to conclusions and finds subtext that isn’t there is usually just insecure."
work,fg3aq2y,t3_ewndjy,1580476378.0,"I've worked in marketing for many years and I wonder if you are just not into it. It can feel very shallow and meaningless sometimes. There's kind of a false sense of importance, as its a massive effort to get people to pay attention to and care about something that might not actually be important to their lives. And in that case, you have to make it important to them, which often feels fake and inauthentic. If that kind of effort doesn't speak to you, I think you'd end up feeling like you're wasting your time on something meaningfulness."

expats,ffzhdzq,t3_ew1d9m,1580379226.0,A lot of international companies are starting to transition into English as the official company language. You could have an easier time finding work in those areas. Look up international companies in the area you want to move and see what kind of job listings they have. Sometimes they will list the language requirements. Or you could stake a year off and do an intensive German language program.

self,ffof070,t1_ffoa4q4,1580076989.0,"I think it can be hard to overcome. It takes a lot of bravado to face the root of unhealthy patterns and even when you do, change doesn’t happen overnight. I spent most of my adult life in relationships with total narcissists and it took a lot of work to start wanting something different. A lot of tears and repeating painful sceneries with of course no different outcome each time. But I’ve been with my current partner for 3 years now and it’s the most stable and secure relationship I’ve ever had. There is something better on the other side. I know it’s not easy, but the fact that you already have this insight about yourself puts you worlds ahead and at a huge advantage. Just keep being kind to yourself. I found it really helpful to read a lot about psychology and relationships. Really helped me process what I went through and what needed to change. Maybe you will find that helpful as well."

But it took me a few years to stop feeling anxious at work. Since I left that job (because I moved) I’ve been really insecure in anxious and pretty miserable overall in my jobs. I don’t know how to fix it. Sometimes I think I’m not meant to interact with people every day. At best I don’t enjoy it, but at worst I can barely make it through. And what’s even worse is the anxiety about going to work. It can ruin my down time and extend the social anxiety far beyond the actual social interactions I have at work."
self,ffo6g9b,t3_euc1bv,1580074598.0,"Look up fearful avoidant attachment style. Most people with unhealthy parenting are either preoccupied with relationships (anxious attachment style) or avoid them (avoidant attachment style). Fearful avoidant attachments usually develop when a parent you depend on for love or survival is also a source of neglect or abuse. It’s common with inconsistent parenting and you kind of get the worst of both unhealthy attachment styles: a desperation for intimacy, along with a deep fear of it. It can lead to very unstable and confusing adult relationships. Your best bet is dealing with your childhood and facing whatever pain this instability might have caused your younger self. When you heal from this kind of trauma, you start to really want something different for yourself."

He knew what he was doing, but acted dumb when I confronted him. It was the last straw in our relationship. I’m sorry you have to deal with this. I’m sure your bf won’t admit he has any ill intentions and he’ll probably try to blame you if you suggest otherwise, but unfortunately for him you’re not stupid. And you have the self worth to know you deserve better. Stay strong and don’t back down if he acts like it’s all in your head. And you know what, I would go. Make him squirm. He’s probably betting on you not going, but there’s no reason he should be alone on a joy ride with another woman on your vacation."
relationship_advice,feo9yjj,t3_eq3aq0,1579297188.0,I’m going to guess she has no idea he has a girlfriend.
work,femqkq7,t3_epzsvp,1579266706.0,"This seems like it could hit all kinds of data privacy violations. If I were you, I'd find a private therapist and avoid any personal health information saved in some sort of digital record at your workplace."
NasalPolyps,fegun2o,t3_ep3sqe,1579102911.0,I’ve experienced some joint pain as well.  Seems to be worse right around when I take the shot.
AskReddit,fegp90g,t3_eoyn3a,1579099284.0,Chocolate.
Life,fegmqrz,t3_ep0by9,1579097440.0,"Don’t worry, it’s totally normal! I completely restarted a new career in my thirties, after 10 years in a different field. And if I could rewind time and start all over again, I think I’d do something entirely different from both! You might be surprised that even people who seem from the outside like they have it together are struggling with the same feelings you are. Just remember to be kind to yourself and follow what makes you happy. You’ll make progress if you keep both of those things in mind."
Life,fegdlsc,t3_ep0by9,1579088949.0,"I understand and have been there. It’s so easy to feel stuck. But you can also start small. Look for some kind of job you think you might enjoy. Not just a job for the sake of a job, but something that  fits your interests. Take a class in a subject that interests you. From there, you meet other people with similar interests. You have a teacher with experience and you can learn from them as well, not just about the subject, but about the industry, how they got involved, what you could do get involved. I find it really helpful to think about the kind of life I want and keep that as motivation. Don’t give up! There’s no reason you don’t deserve to be successful in whatever you decide you want. Admitting you are unhappy is the first step to building a better life."
work,fegd8rh,t3_ep13sf,1579088523.0,"I would ask for advice from your manager, explain that everyone is insisting their requests are urgent and you’re trying to learn to balance what priorities take precedent. Give as much detail and examples as you can, make a list of the types of requests you get, and tell your manager you’d love her feedback so that you can make these judgments on your own. If your manager doesn’t have the perspective to help, seek out other colleagues in similar roles. Ask them how they learned what to prioritize."
Life,fegcyvk,t3_ep0by9,1579088191.0,"It’s normal not to know what you’re meant to do at your age. It’s the time when you are figuring it all out. But if you are struggling with motivation, you might be suffering from depression. I would recommend talking to a doctor or at least doing some research on your own because there are ways to address feeling stuck and learn to build new patterns. The hardest part is always the beginning, but don’t give up. We are all capable of building happy and fulfilling lives, even if it’s more of a struggle for some of us. Happiness is worth fighting for."
NasalPolyps,feendlg,t3_eormbd,1579037259.0,"I went through my lung doctor because it seems to be better known by them, since it’s been approved for treating asthma much longer than for polyps. But if you have a progressive ENT they might prescribe it. It’s helped with my nasal polyps so much!"
offmychest,fedvmv3,t1_feddh3b,1579020847.0,"Moving forward from you past takes a lot of strength, bravado, and resilience. Painful experiences aside, that doesn’t come naturally to everyone. And people that use their past as a crutch are probably as afraid of their pain as they are of letting it go. I’m sure you know that trauma is complicated and people don’t work through it in the same way at the same speed."
offmychest,fed513d,t3_eog7oh,1578999199.0,"I think we can’t blame people for not having “made it” to a healthier place. Some people have more natural resilience and some people have to work to build it. Just like some people have an easier time with compassion, while others simply lose their patience. We can choose not to fill our lives with people who are stuck in these cycles, but maybe we’re not meant judge their experiences so much."
DoesAnybodyElse,fed4h2t,t3_eofpdt,1578998390.0,"I think it’s more a sign of insecurity. You want external validation, but at the same time it makes you uncomfortable either because you’re not used to it or because you also have social anxiety. I think it’s a natural desire, but sometimes people that are insecure didn’t receive enough attention or validation growing up and can yearn for this from others. My bet is if you work in your confidence, this feeling will die down."
work,fe5yw8q,t3_enoau3,1578878023.0,"If you can tolerate it for a year, think of it as a temporary boost that will help boost you even further after this. Just remember, it doesn’t have to be forever and it might open some new doors for your future."
work,fdzp880,t3_enb4a7,1578792740.0,"Congrats, you earned this big sigh of relief! I hope you find someplace healthier and more in like with your experience. In the meantime, you better slot in some time to celebrate your freedom!"
NasalPolyps,fdsc5vj,t3_emv4y2,1578699239.0,I’ve had good results with Dupixent too. Only on for a month and my polyps have already shrunk so much that I don’t need surgery anymore.
work,fdqfeth,t1_fdpjc29,1578665278.0,"I agree. You shouldn’t worry about getting fined if he lied to you about your salaries, but it might be worth contacting someone above him or HR in the company and explaining the situation. This could save some other unfortunate folks from experiencing this situation in the future."
work,fdpwoj9,t3_emkhdj,1578643641.0,"Probably not great to be working in an environment where you feel undervalued, but I would take this job as training ground, keep your relationships at work positive, and build your experience for at least a year for your resume. After that, you can start applying to jobs and find a team/position where your role and salary match your actual work more. If you work is good enough that it’s being passed off as something a senior did, I have no doubt you’ll find something more appropriate in the future."
Dentists,fdngrde,t1_fdn2k0i,1578585466.0,Thank you. I went to a different dentist and they ended up just doing the cold test. Had a root canal today and am so grateful that the pain is gone.
