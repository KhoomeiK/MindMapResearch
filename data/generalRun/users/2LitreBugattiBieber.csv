RugbyTraining,fgny3oz,t3_ezkufc,1580955435.0,"I’m not sure it’s necessary to do 5x leg workouts a week? You can try and if you’re recovering wel enough then that’s fine but also if you can recover from 5 sessions it might be time to look at your routine, a lot of people can make strength progressions with 3 sessions. Also please check out split squats as they’re argued to be better than traditional back squats for athleticism and strength."

RationalPsychonaut,fgnqd6b,t1_fgna0a7,1580950561.0,"It feels like the smoking is bringing up these feelings of incompetence and guilt. Maybe I don’t do a good job of confronting these things sober, but I feel like when I do confront my demons I take them very personally and harshly. I don’t want to blame anything but it makes sense I was raised in a very strict household where achievement wasn’t praised but failure was very badly addressed, it feels like even though I don’t live at home anymore I still get these feelings and I think other people just brush them off and don’t let it get to them, whatever the case is I know I’m overthinking and that I just need to chill.. and most of the time I can! It just doesn’t make it any easier even when you know why or what is eating at you lol. I haven’t smoked much in years and don’t really have an interest for it anymore but When I do (which is maybe once every two years) id like if I could just chill and relax like everyone else 100% of the time hahaha it seems like I have to force my relaxation. 

I feel you on the moderation thing, I’m like that with alcohol I can’t have one or two, like I’m either getting blacked out or I’m not drinking, no in between.. I would probably say that it comes down to your relationship with the substance.. you could try changing it by moderating it or you could probably just quit cold turkey since that’ll be better since you’re an all or nothing person. If you do relapse (if you do it’ll probably be a BIG relapse) just try to forgive yourself and carry on. As for activities what helped me dearly was sports, I play rugby and it’s my passion.. like I would give up anything just to play.. including drugs or alcohol and I love alcohol.. so you have to find your passion or hop off the weed for a bit until you realise what the weed is holding you back from is a passion that was unrealised or under appreciated..  I didn’t appreciate my passion for years and it left a void in my life.. once I re-realised it I hold on to it like it’s my life"
