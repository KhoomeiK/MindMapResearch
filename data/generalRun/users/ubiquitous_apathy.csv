Either there needs to be less coins given out, or stars/items need to cost more.  The unique dice, while are fun, are pretty unbalanced.  The +coins dice are god awful compared to the -coins dice since your average roll is much more important than a few coins (because going back to my earlier point, the economy is all out of whack).

Honestly if you cant figure out why an individual metric isn't a good way to decide who had the most impact, then I just dont think you understand this game at all.  You either win or you lose.  Having players play for accolades over wins just sounds like dog shit.

You could have gold damage and elims as a tank and your team could lose because you weren't peeling enemies off of your dps well enough, so they were always dead.  

Even more specific, dva can very easily pull out gold elims without having any real impact on those kills. 

Junk rat could be busting out big damage numbers compared to his teams tracker, but if all the damage hes putting out is getting healed up until tracer is knocking out the supports, at the very least their impact was equal while tracers damage number is much lower. 

Your individual stats in a losing effort are meaningless. It's very easy to do ""the best"" on your team if you're prioritizing stats over winning.


And I keep saying it here, but I'll say it again.  You are the only constant variable between all of your matches. If you are better than the other players at your sr, you'll go up.
