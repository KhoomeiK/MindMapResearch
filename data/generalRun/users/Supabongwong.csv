Keep it up.

I remember when I first started using a  tablet for photo editing it was definitely a transition from a mouse. But it made things way easier. On a dedicated graphics tablet you can lean your hand on the tablet and it won't affect anything since you can turn off touch - I tend to lean my hand on my tablet (I'm assuming you're in an iPad) and you never have to worry about a battery pen dying. I would say to maybe look into one, as having different tools for different situations is always a good thing.

It is different in terms of looking at the screen to draw and you not looking at your hand, but the input lag is much lower and you don't have to worry about changing where you place the pen - since on an iPad the cursor doesn't drop in the exact spot you are drawing (it's kind of adjacent).

Something to consider and definitely a must if you ever work on a desktop.

I love my Wacom, and yes, it is the cost of an iPad (the actual Cintiq is the cost of a computer), but it's worth at least investing some research into.

Good luck on your digital imagery career!"

eldertrees,ffaemwt,t1_ff55izl,1579733872.0,"This is true.

You may start to synthesize toxic vapor at 392f and benzene at 401f, but the amount is miniscule compared to smoking (you're using butane to light the joint) and also comparably to car pollution or a highly polluted area - not that bad.

Vapor is about 90-95% THC and is considerably much safer than smoke.

I'd say the top limit for cannabinoids to activate is 428f so generally don't go over that. If your vape is good, you won't combust at that temp, but once you start getting to 451+ there is increased risk of fire/combustion. 

Vape at the temperature you like to get buzzed at, as lower temps will give more cerebral effects and higher temps generally more sedative effects, though it is also cannabis type dependent. (percentages of cannabinoids and terpenes present)

My response:
Customer complaint - vibration in 2nd gear, and said it was a problem with his transmission. Michael road tested the car with the customer, he realized that it was not the transmission, but it could be an issue with the drive-shaft. Told the customer if that is the problem, we could remove it and the car would drive fine (without 4x4). Removed the driveshaft, and road tested the car without it, no more vibration. Problem is not with transmission. New u-joint installed instead of entire driveshaft, and road tested - no vibration. Reinstalled driveshaft so that 4x4 was enabled, and did another road test. U-joint installation was part of total parts/labour, as the other time was spent in diagnosing the problem."

You torch a cap that you put on the bowl. The cap ""clicks"" (kind of analogous to a steam teapot) when it has reached the proper temperature. I believe the metals get to a certain temp and snap together, though I'm not 100% on the mechanism. You then rip it and then it will click again once it's cooled down.
