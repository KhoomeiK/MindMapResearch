Shitstatistssay,ffjpt7i,t1_ffjeq4l,1580003902.0,"Theres no reason for a union to exist is my point. They're  head locks on any new business in an area, they're strictly beneficial to members and noone else. As long as unions dont grow it's not a big issue, but more government protection and favorability will cause a tilted  work force."
Shitstatistssay,ffjdfo8,t1_ffiwvp2,1579995942.0,"American unions are more commercialized now anyway. Strikes are about union lawyers and union reps not getting more money during negotiations , not about worker benefits or wages increase/decrease."

People who would vote for him need to realize he Is trying to changing the form of government we have, not compliment it."

You come to the town your working in (if the town requires it) and take a competency test that's less then 25 questions.

army,ff3d1qt,t1_ff36gey,1579538702.0,The guard unit I was in are in silent protest. If it wasn't for the respect of the senior leadership in the community everybody would probably be raising hell in the square with the big old buckets of stokers and bud light.

GoldandBlack,feps02o,t1_feox92s,1579329288.0,"I work with a guy that's a socialist. Like blam-in-your-face about it all the time. He calls himself the ""oldest millenial"". Hes your standard band geek/DnD/Larp teen from the 90's. So anyway, he thinks people on welfare should have more welfare despite ability to work or not. It's the government's responsibility to take care of every single person 24/7 beyond basic necessities. We work for a multibillion dollar company and he feels like the fact our insurance is $500 a year deductible for a family with a 4000 out of pocket max, with private urgent care facilities built on our buildings that are 100% free to go too for all family members, that give 100% free medication in their pharmacy still doesn't come close to the social responsibilities our owners owe the public and believes they need to pay more into the society. This fool bitched about a free $2.00/hr raise because he felt it still didnt cover the owners responsibility to him. Oh that $2.00/hr raise was given to every single person in our 5 facilities, plus a 3% bonus, and PTO increase, because people were upset and voiced their concerns about the pay. Oh and then two weeks later we got our actual year end raise of 30-40%. Theres no making that dude happy."

He did amazing for having 0 tapes on him, then once people caught on to his play style he couldn't keep up with his own hype and kind of shambled. He's got the foundations to be a great quarterback, just hope that ""I need to be a rockstar"" all the time attitude goes and he enjoys the game again."
