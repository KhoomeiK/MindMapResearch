Tinder,ffdfvfk,t1_ffd4kx7,1579820012.0,Oh no that’s most definitely it. Imagine the ego on someone who’s expecting something like that while also acting like an absolute tool. And gets shocked when acting that way leads to someone not being interested. She was banking on me having absolute no self respect.

Vegan."
Tinder,ffcnrqa,t1_ffcmyea,1579803383.0,"After I sent the first response I saw she called me stupid and was just shocked.
Edit:
Also, she sent that message 5 seconds after sending the first."
Tinder,ffcnnyc,t1_ffcm0yp,1579803317.0,"It confused me to. Like when she said I not call her dude even though that was several messages ago. So bizzarre.

If I had to take a guess she must have just assumed I would go along with everything and get food for her? I have no idea."

hamsters,ff7wpmp,t3_erpki1,1579660161.0,When I fall asleep in my office (because I’m an unhealthy workaholic) it actually makes me happy to hear my baby running on his wheel. It tells me he’s getting his exercise. Plus if it does wake me up it gives me incentive to get off my couch as sleep in my room like a healthy human being.
Tinder,ff30jvq,t1_ff2yrz9,1579530422.0,5 dollars for a convo that probably would have been drier then the bread Bojack Horsemen spent 10 dollars on. Bizarre shit my man.

niceguys,fexzh0p,t3_eqti3j,1579438770.0,"God that kiss was so awkward in the movie. It legit felt as out of nowhere as the Rose and Finn kiss. StarWars really needs to stop pulling that “SURPRISE! LOVE!” It felt so weird especially since I got a more sibling vibe from Ben and Ray’s dynamic.

Other then that the movie was actually pretty fun. No hate to anyone who liked the kiss or just didn’t like the movie."
