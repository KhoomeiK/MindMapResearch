aviation,ffvxzdo,t1_ffvhwy6,1580276764.0,"At least in general aviation (Cessna 172s and such) single engine planes have a much better safety record, due to fewer points of failure, and differential thrust not being a factor when a single engine aircraft loses thrust. 

When the pilot of single engine plane loses engine power, they usually have a decent amount of time to diagnose the issue, or start flying towards a good emergency landing area, all without having to fight the airplane. 

When a light twin engine plane like a Beechcraft Baron loses an engine, the pilot will all of a sudden be devoting all of his or her energy and time to flying the aircraft properly with one engine inoperative. On some twin engine planes, especially on hot days with a full payload, one engine may not be enough to climb or even stay airborne if the other engine quits. So not only is the pilot fighting a physically exhausting turning tendency, usually without the aid of autopilot, the plane will also need to be landed immediately anyway. If I do any general aviation flying, I would prefer just one engine 


As for larger planes, especially airliners with fly by wire systems and complex flight control systems/autopilots, the plane is perfectly capable of flying safely with one engine inoperative, so in that case it’s better to have a second engine for redundancy, not to mention the performance gain."

Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet."

I understand your emotional response to me “attempting to infringe” on women’s reproductive rights, but please either address my logical arguments, or stop calling names and have a good night. Come back to America where we value life. 

(A key libertarian concept is you should be able to do whatever you please, as long as it doesn’t violate *someone else’s* rights. An unborn child is *someone else*. My argument can’t get much more clear than that.)"
VAGuns,ff85nf9,t1_ff82dom,1579666666.0,"First I’m not a grabber, so don’t put words in my mouth; let’s keep it civil. I’m very serious about fighting for our gun rights, so you should take all the allies you can get. 

And I’ve read the 2nd amendment. Defend is a literally a synonym for “protect.” So self defense would be a valid phrase whether it refers to a group or individual, but I understand the distinction you’re trying to draw.

My wife is 7 weeks pregnant and she got her first ultrasound today. I got to see and hear my unborn child’s heartbeat on the monitor. It’s a life. 

And premature babies have been able to sustain themselves earlier and earlier, with better medical technology. Like this baby born at 21 weeks, barely halfway through the second trimester. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/11/14/mom-delivers-earliest-premature-baby-ever-and-chooses-resuscitate-miracle-aughter-now-healthy-toddle/861386001/ 

However, sustainability is a mediocre argument for pro-life, in my opinion, even though it would render almost 50% of abortions immoral, based on the scientific fact that babies are viable as early as 21 weeks. Because even humans after birth are unable to sustain themselves in many situations. I would argue that children are incapable of sustaining their own life for quite a while AFTER birth; they need almost constant care and attention in order to survive the first several years of life. 

An even better example: You might get in a car wreck tomorrow and have to be on a respirator or worse, be in a coma with a feeding tube. You would absolutely not be capable of sustaining your own life, at least temporarily, but I and everyone I know would fight to the death in order to defend your right to life in that case. *Especially* if the doctors promised that you would have a 99% chance of being perfectly healthy in 9 months. 

Sustainability is a nice thing to acknowledge, but ultimately it does not define life, because it is so subjective to the technology and care available. 

The fact is that, if untampered with, a “zygote” or “fetus” will ultimately become a fully functioning human being with all the rights, thoughts, and emotions as anyone else alive. To tamper with the chain of life after it has already been put into motion is  murder. Once the gametes have joined in conception, the “zygote” already has his or her genetic information that he or she will have for the rest of his or her life. He or she already has everything encoded in the DNA: a skin complexion, hair and eye color, in addition to almost 50,000 other attributes. 


To make a gun analogy: which is a greater violation of my right to keep and bear arms? In the process of transferring a gun to myself, the government unjustly denies me a permit/background check and therefore the ability to continue the process of obtaining a firearm? Or breaking into my house in the middle of night without a warrant in order to confiscate the gun I already own legally. I would guess that there’s more of an emotional response to the latter, due to the fact that the gun was already physically present in my possession. But I would argue that “aborting” the process of me legally obtaining a firearm is as much a breach of my rights as seizing a gun I already have.

In case you missed the nuance: the first example is an abortion, and the second is murder. Both are murder. 

Unjustly breaking the the chain of life is murder, no matter how old the person is. 

Have a good night man, hope we can either continue this interesting discussion civilly. Otherwise I’ll just shut up."
VAGuns,ff81tdc,t1_ff7yrvi,1579663763.0,"But the the ability to legally kill an unborn child isn’t a human right like the right to self defense is. 

If anything, the right of a baby to develop to term without being murdered for convenience is more of a human right than self defense, just barely. 

In my opinion, “their choice, their right” is like defending a Nazi’s choice or right to kill Jews simply because they think Jews are subhuman, like apparently unborn babies are. Or defending a pedofile’s right to rape children, because it’s “their sexual orientation.” 

The pro-life movement has the moral high ground against the pro-choice movement, and if I had to absolutely die on a hill for something, it’s a very close decision between abortion and 2A, but I think abortion would win."

Kinetic energy isn’t linear. KE = 1/2• Mass• Velocity^2 . So speed makes way more of a difference in energy than most people think.

GunAccessoriesForSale,fe5se33,t3_enuq5k,1578873910.0,Interested in the Wolf and the SSA-E. Does the wolf have fixed front sights?

nailedit,fdxsfbr,t3_en7if1,1578772463.0,Looks like the T is coming out of the closet; I’m so proud.

The F-16’s canopy, for example is designed to deform under bird impact, and for that reason, pilots want a minimum of one fist length of space between their helmets and the canopy above while seated. 

The T-6 I trained with had a canopy strong enough to sustain a strike of a 4 pound bird at 270 knots. Or as I liked to joke, a 270 pound bird at 4 knots."

Turns out most folks don’t mind weed, they just have an issue with stoner culture and all the things that go with it. It can get super trashy when everybody has to wear all Jamaican colors and be unemployed. Really not doing their hobby a favor."
