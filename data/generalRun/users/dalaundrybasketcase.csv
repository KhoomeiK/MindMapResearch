As far as your family? I’m sorry. That’s terrifying to have to hide who you are. Just know you have allies in this world who support you and who do love you for who you are and who you love - gay, bi, middle eastern, whatever.

family,fe5zdgi,t3_enwkax,1578878324.0,"I’m not accusing you of anything... 

However. It absolutely sounds like you have romantic and or sexual feelings towards your cousin. Your attachment to her is really unhealthy and co dependent. Your life is YOUR choice. You need to live for you and not on the basis of whether or not someone wants to be around you. 

Would killing yourself just because your cousin doesn’t want to hang out be manipulative? Absolutely. And it would probably do great harm to her mentally in the long run. 

I’m not a doctor but I am really concerned about your mental health. It isn’t normal or rational to be so focused on your cousin, let alone to the point of suicide. Your comments about her boyfriend being very negative and the comments about her pissing on your grave are also atypical. I really think you’d benefit from seeing a doctor or a therapist who can help you with your feelings rather than suicide."
