So you were discussing whether you think the politics are relevant... therefore you were discussing the politics. Also as I already pointed out, "" if how a country treats people within and around was relevant to host a sporting event, China wouldn't be the only one banned"" is an inherently faulty position to take.  It can be relevant and china can absolutely still be the only one banned because they can be the only one who's particular bad behavior rises to a high enough level to violate the standards being used to judge.  

> You still seem to want to go full politics into this. Right sub for that is [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/) 

Nope.  I'm fine right here. It's in the context of a formula 1 race.  If you don't want to have this discussion, nobody's making you participate. 

> This is an F1 sub, and we are already off topic enough. I could go on with a huge list of different things different countries have done recently, the ones I highlighted even, but again, wrong sub for that. So yes, a simplistic comment is enough to show how sport and politics should never get together. 

You didn't seem to think it was the ""wrong sub for that"" until you utterly failed to make your point effectively. The politics are relevant to F1 because they have a direct impact on whether people find it morally or socially acceptable to hold an F1 race in that venue.  You can play the 'stick to sports' card all you want but it doesn't magically change the reality that they're relevant to each other just because you only want to talk about it when struck by the appropriate level of performative whimsy.   

And no a ""simplistic comment"" is not enough because its simplicity actively misrepresents the facts of the situation by treating different severities of a problem equally.  All transgressions are not equal and any simplification that treats them like that are is inherently false.

Yes you are making that point and that's the point that is completely and unequivocally false.  It's not a binary equation.  It's not about ""any"" harm.  Nothing is. Severity doesn't stop mattering just because you can't be bothered to consider it.

People die every day.  Even in the rule of law we don't treat them all the same.  Pretty much every single society on earth actively recognizes that motive and method are important to judging the severity of a wrongdoing, not just the end result. We can disagree on what we consider to be more extreme or more objectionable and that's fine but to actively argue that there are no degrees and that it's a binary good vs bad scenario is beyond the level of farce and is as intellectually lazy and dishonest as claiming you don't want to combine politics and sports after you made over a  half dozen posts actively arguing over the connection between the two."

You are absolutely trying to downplay the awfulness of what china does by pointing out that everyone else is bad too, and you're not even being remotely coy about it. The problem is you're either unable or unwilling to think outside of the false dichotomy between having ""clean hands"" or not.  There are degrees of severity here.  

> The point being made, that has flow completely over your head, is that if a condition to host a sport would be to have “clean hands”, then many countries wouldn’t be allowed to host sporting events. 

No it didn't ""fly over my head"" at all.  I get it.  It's just a farcical point to make. Your initial statement was "" Sure, but if we are going that route, there won’t be sporting events in most places."" and quite frankly, that's complete BS, because *if we go that route,* it is a logical and reasonable position to look at the scope and scale of China's current and ongoing atrocities and judge them worse, and thus less worthy of holding a major global sporting event, than pretty much anyone else on this list. 

What you're doing here is textbook whattaboutism and that doesn't magically change because you want to try and narrow the definition.

Someone said you that China's ""skeletons"" in their closet are worse, and that's exactly the point you're for some reason trying to avoid here.  They absolutely are.   We can absolutely go the route of looking at china and saying ""you are so bad and awful with such horrible human rights abuses *currently ongoing* that we don't want to have a race there"" while still having events int he US, ""most of the middle east"" and even Russia because even if ""everyone's hands are dirty"" china's are filthier than most."

There's a difference between ""not having clean hands"" and being a functional dictatorship that  actively engages in ethnic cleansing.

As is pretty much always the case with F1 at least 1 team who sees China as a race they're weak at (or otherwise sees a benefit to keeping Japan or whatever alternate race where it is) will object *strongly* to any moves. 

Hell most of the teams already seem to think 21 races is at least 1 too many.  So some will just see it as a reason to keep it down to 20."

You say ""of course"" and then you immediately go on to say something that makes it clear you don't actually grasp the concept that firmly. The ""rules"" were ""introduced"" because at the time of their development, it was the most tactically appealing way to fight a war. Not to be more humane, not because of honor... Maybe you have some core reading comprehension problem but this thread is literally about the supposed honor of a captain asking another captain to ""loan him some ammo, *with which he will continue attempting to maim and kill the men under his command*.  If you think that has anything to do with making war more humane, I'll never be able to stoop to a level low enough to meaningfully explain to you why that's fucking insane.

This is absolute nonsense.  So what.... change happens?  There's no point here, chief.

>  Do we still frown upon some things based on our moral standpoints? Absolutely yes. That's what honor used to be. 

The point that you're totally missing here is that ""honor"" and the supposed morality it's based on are arbitrary constructs of what the people making it up want it to be. Like I said it's window dressing, nothing more. 

> Without it we could just use scorched earth policies like so many other civilizations in history. Kill all the men, elderly and children and take the women. It's a much more effective way to win. 

I'm going to say this one more time... if you have some kind of literacy issue preventing you from understanding this I cannot help you, I'm sorry.... but **I'm not talking about killing civillians.**  It is also infrequently a ""more effective way to win"" for a variety of reasons.  Now you're literally just making things up. 

> Is it romanticized to suggest we don't kill women, children and civilians? Or romanticized to suggest we don't just execute prisoners? 

No and I never said it was.  I made it clear that this isn't what I'm talking about.  If you can't even be honest enough to address what I'm actually saying instead of constructing straw men please don't waste your and my time with this juvenile nonsense. 

> I feel like you're focusing on exceptions and weird rules of chivalry and not the general idea of honor amongst fighting men.

> It's like calling an entire legal system dumb because you don't agree with nudity laws. 

No, it isn't.   It's like pointing out the flaws in old laws that have already been taken off the books when someone tries to wax nostalgic about the old ways or claim that they were dropped because ""there's no money in it, sadly."" (Seriously go back and read the goddamn thread I was responding to.  Then read it again.  Then read it *a third time*, and then ask an adult to explain it to you because you are clearly attempting to have your own argument with me when you don't even understand what I was commenting on).

> Focus on the actual system not individual rules we see as weird centuries later.

>Wholesale slaughtering everyone on the other side surrendered, civilian  or wounded would have been seen as dishonorable and not an  international war crime.

It's almost like you ignored when I explicitly called out the difference between things like this and the honor bullshit that this article is literally about.  I can't tell if you're trying to be pedantic and just not making it or if you literally don't get that there's a difference here between *shit we still widely recognize as unacceptable* and the ""gentleman's"" warfare bullshit that just romanticized war.  I'm talking about all the stuff that was dropped when the idea of honor warfare was dropped. I'm being fairly clear too so I don't think I understand what the problem is.  If you don't get that this conversation is never going to go anywhere.

Fighting has no inherent honor.  The notion of governing the attempt to kill another human being to establish dominance with rules of ""honor"" is a farce.  Doing it in the least inhumane manner possible is understandable and laudable.  Doing it ""honorably"" is just an excuse for risking people's lives to window dress something brutal."
todayilearned,ff9tojh,t1_ff9kzww,1579721037.0,"I still don't really agree.  Unless the party has access to 100% of the information informing them that this person is physically impossible to convince under any circumstances (which is honestly unlikely, because they'd have to know the person's life story, all the info available to them *and*  whatever previous information that person's been given to the contrary), it's fair to roll to preserve that uncertainty. There's a difference between failing because a person is just REALLY hard to convince and you're just not good enough to do it on your best day, and being unable to convince someone because they're being magically influenced to believe a fixed set of facts or because they literally saw the evidence to the contrary with their own eyes and you don't know it.  It's always a DM discretion but players are never *wrong* for attempting to roll, because the DM can just ignore it or set the DC arbitrarily high.  And even then how ""convincing"" the lie was, even unbelieved, may still very well influence the NPC's actions later on. 

Also that example is kind of an absurd situation.  For every one case where a player can and does roll the theoretical maximum for a stat check, there are thousands of instances where people can't even reach half of that. If my player tries to climb something with a DC of 40 and the highest he can possibly roll is a 35, I'm still going to let him roll because it's still up to him to gague how far from success he really is and determining whether it's worth looking for lower DC conditions.  

To be honest I see an attitude like ""shit players saying to do something and rolling first"" and I just see it as bad DMing.  Regarding players that way for something as simple as a roll is a DM problem, not a player problem.  If they do it, tell them they failed and if you want tell them they don't need to roll because it's clearly physically impossible to them."

It made it easier to romanticize war which made it more palatable which made it easier to justify and start.  It  made it easier to get willing troops, and less politically inconvenient to press unwilling people into service one way or another.  

WWI may have somewhat dramatically put the final nail in the coffin of honor warfare but it was already obsolete and costing lives before anyone fighting in it was born. It just marked the point where the disparity between the technology and the tactics was not just bad but so amazingly, mindblowingly, shockingly bad that it could no longer be ignored.

1. For the guys doing most of the shooting and getting shot, the honor a duel isn't worth a damn.  A canister of grapeshot is going to shred your intestines and leave you to die slowly on the deck of a ship regardless of whatever secret handshakes your captain knew. 
2. Honor warfare only existed because of practicality in the first place.  The process of fighting during the day in orderly formations and full view was induced by the limitations of the weapons and technology of the time, and the idea that it was a matter of "" honor"" was simply a case of inflexible (read: bad at their job) officers reacting poorly to weapons or tactics that put their nice clean approach at a disadvantage.

You didn't seem to think it was the ""wrong sub for that"" until you utterly failed to make your point effectively. The politics are relevant to F1 because they have a direct impact on whether people find it morally or socially acceptable to hold an F1 race in that venue.  You can play the 'stick to sports' card all you want but it doesn't magically change the reality that they're relevant to each other just because you only want to talk about it when struck by the appropriate level of performative whimsy.

You are absolutely trying to downplay the awfulness of what china does by pointing out that everyone else is bad too, and you're not even being remotely coy about it. The problem is you're either unable or unwilling to think outside of the false dichotomy between having ""clean hands"" or not.  There are degrees of severity here.

No it didn't ""fly over my head"" at all.  I get it.  It's just a farcical point to make. Your initial statement was "" Sure, but if we are going that route, there wonâ€™t be sporting events in most places."" and quite frankly, that's complete BS, because *if we go that route,* it is a logical and reasonable position to look at the scope and scale of China's current and ongoing atrocities and judge them worse, and thus less worthy of holding a major global sporting event, than pretty much anyone else on this list. 

What you're doing here is textbook whattaboutism and that doesn't magically change because you want to try and narrow the definition.

Someone said you that China's ""skeletons"" in their closet are worse, and that's exactly the point you're for some reason trying to avoid here.  They absolutely are.   We can absolutely go the route of looking at china and saying ""you are so bad and awful with such horrible human rights abuses *currently ongoing* that we don't want to have a race there"" while still having events int he US, ""most of the middle east"" and even Russia because even if ""everyone's hands are dirty"" china's are filthier than most."

The ""rules"" were ""introduced"" because at the time of their development, it was the most tactically appealing way to fight a war. Not to be more humane, not because of honor... Maybe you have some core reading comprehension problem but this thread is literally about the supposed honor of a captain asking another captain to ""loan him some ammo, *with which he will continue attempting to maim and kill the men under his command*.  If you think that has anything to do with making war more humane, I'll never be able to stoop to a level low enough to meaningfully explain to you why that's fucking insane.

Fighting has no inherent honor.  The notion of governing the attempt to kill another human being to establish dominance with rules of ""honor"" is a farce.

There's a difference between failing because a person is just REALLY hard to convince and you're just not good enough to do it on your best day, and being unable to convince someone because they're being magically influenced to believe a fixed set of facts or because they literally saw the evidence to the contrary with their own eyes and you don't know it.  It's always a DM discretion but players are never *wrong* for attempting to roll, because the DM can just ignore it or set the DC arbitrarily high.  And even then how ""convincing"" the lie was, even unbelieved, may still very well influence the NPC's actions later on. 

Also that example is kind of an absurd situation.  For every one case where a player can and does roll the theoretical maximum for a stat check, there are thousands of instances where people can't even reach half of that. If my player tries to climb something with a DC of 40 and the highest he can possibly roll is a 35, I'm still going to let him roll because it's still up to him to gague how far from success he really is and determining whether it's worth looking for lower DC conditions.  

To be honest I see an attitude like ""shit players saying to do something and rolling first"" and I just see it as bad DMing.

It  made it easier to get willing troops, and less politically inconvenient to press unwilling people into service one way or another.  

WWI may have somewhat dramatically put the final nail in the coffin of honor warfare but it was already obsolete and costing lives before anyone fighting in it was born.

1. For the guys doing most of the shooting and getting shot, the honor a duel isn't worth a damn.  A canister of grapeshot is going to shred your intestines and leave you to die slowly on the deck of a ship regardless of whatever secret handshakes your captain knew. 
2. Honor warfare only existed because of practicality in the first place.  The process of fighting during the day in orderly formations and full view was induced by the limitations of the weapons and technology of the time, and the idea that it was a matter of "" honor"" was simply a case of inflexible (read: bad at their job) officers reacting poorly to weapons or tactics that put their nice clean approach at a disadvantage.

I look at it the same way I look at diagnoses like ""SIDS"" or chronic fatigue syndrome.  It's a catch-all that isn't in itself a disorder but a blanket term for a bunch of similarly presenting things they don't have an explanation for yet.  

SIDS is basically a catchall for the fact that babies are fragile, underdeveloped creatures with lots of potential for unnoticed defects or ailments to present without warning. 

CFS is basically ""you get tired all the time, there's almost certainly a reason but we don't know exactly why."" 

ODD is basically a catchall for the fact that slightly older children can have multiple different things that cause them to misbehave  and is consequently ""we know your kid doesn't play nice with authority figures but we don't actually know what's causing it."""

People go the MLM route for all sorts of reasons.   And you don't have to be ""low paid"" to feel like you don't have enough money. I mean the kind of person to go for an MLM is as a rule not someone who's going to be making good money decisions regardless.  If they were capable of being smart with their money they'd more likely than not see through an MLM and identify it as a questionable investment. The ""bossbabe"" bullshit and other prosperity gospel type nonsense appeals to pretty much anyone with material wants if they don't critically examine it. 

Also and I know people don't want to hear this but while there are definitely some teachers that are underpaid and probably some regions that chronically underpay their teachers, it's not some poverty epidemic in the US.  It's also a seasonal job.  It's a 1500 hrs/year job (8 hours/day for 180 US school days + extra days for non-student days with meetings, planning, etc).  You need to multiply whatever they're earning by 1.3x and account for benefits before you start comparing it to a normal year-long salaried job (40 hour work weeks with 2 weeks of vacation per year taken out at entry level).  

The *only* things that speak to whether teachers are underpaid are if they can recruit enough decent teachers (if they're leaving for better markets they're obviously underpaid relative to the competition) and how they compare to comparable salaried jobs in the area after adjusting for annual work hours."

Also ""public speaking"" in no way means it doesn't involve the children.  I'm not sure where you're getting that.  ""Public speaking"" is very much a part of education of children.

As far as fighting over him and the FP sessions, it's worth noting that signing with Red Bull would mean at least 1 year in a STR and some good timing with having a vacancy at the main team before he'd be in the ""real"" team.
