I love magic and I've played since 96' but come on this is getting ridiculous with the amount of product you guys are printing.

If magic is going to become a product of 10 ""special"" ""premium"" buy direct from hasbro products a year - I'm out."

Day cares are a shit show, there's kids there that may come from anti-vax homes and ultimately who is going to take better care of your child? Family looking after one? Or strangers looking after 5+ kids.

Nothing against parents that do send their kids to day care or have no choice, I personally am not a fan"
NewParents,ffspslx,t3_ev0iod,1580188265.0,"Honestly - stuff like waking up to a warm coffee and muffin it's amazing. Personally my wife and I are picky eaters so pre cooked meals are out, but saying ""oh hey we are just seining by so and so, can we grab you anything"" goes along way.

It's always nice when someone shows up with diapers or formula. 

Now I know those are money driven options so far, but also having people offer to watch our kid so we can shower or finish some laundry is great too! 

Even just being there to listen/let them vent If they are struggling is great. Any type of support is top notch! 

Hope this helps"

Everyone fucking streams and let's algorithms pick their music for them.

There's a handful of ""crate diggers"" left.

When I tell me I'm staying home to look for new music and update my usbs and music player they think I'm lying and trying to make up excuses until I show them my 250gbs of high quality music files LOL.
