Few tries to work on a 6s with 13.3, but it did work. 

Can’t get it to work on my Mini4-WiFi that’s still on 12.4, but that may work if I move to 13.3 perhaps?

My 8+ on 13.3 will load the checkra1n app but WiFi is turned off and cannot be turned on, it’s disabled just like the cellular data switch which I know won’t work since there’s no SIM card in it.  But the 6s doesn’t have a SIM either and it worked fine. 

Ever heard of WiFi being disabled on an 8+ like that?  WiFi works fine when it’s booted normally, and “on”’before I enter DFU."

At one point he gets a good grip on a large piece of driftwood and you think maybe he's going to be OK, but then for whatever reason he lets go of it and is back to struggling.  Another guy jumps in to save him, and the drowning guy immediately starts trying to climb out of the water using the rescuer, and they both start going under.  They bob back up 2-3 times, but it's literally 60 seconds on the dot from the time the second guy made contact that they went under the surface for the last time.
