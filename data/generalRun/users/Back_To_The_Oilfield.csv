todayilearned,ffmfcwn,t1_ffmbv8a,1580053813.0,"Both systems have their faults, but as far as a company goes I honestly don’t think a democratic approach is the right one.

As far as government, I currently have Trump as a president so I’m not sure democracy is working out that well right now (I’m mostly joking)."
todayilearned,ffm9vdc,t1_ffk50nh,1580051076.0,"The problem is, a huge majority of the time the workers will have ZERO idea what qualities and expertise the leader will need. It would turn into a popularity contest where people promised a bunch of bullshit during the election that they couldn’t actually do, and then they would get elected and have no god damn idea what they need to be doing.

I’m literally dealing with this at my company right now. I’m upper/middle level management at my company. I know the CEO, I share the office building with the branch managers, and deal daily with the shift foremen and their workers. 

The shift foremen and their guys have been trying to get the managers above me replaced for months, simply because “I never see them do anything, I could do their jobs”. You never see them because their jobs are ENTIRELY different than yours. But they are actively trying to cripple the company out of their own ignorance of the business and what that management job actually entails.

Now imagine if those guys got to pick the CEO. I understand wanting to have some say in who is running your company, but there’s a reason you don’t."

Realistically I’ve probably ingested WAY more piss in public pools so it shouldn’t bother me, but I just can’t do it."

Laying there and hearing your teeth shatter while your head is getting yanked side to side while they try to pull out molars with pliers has a permanent affect on how you view trips to the dentist."

PLEASE, leave that relationship. Especially if you’re recovering from anorexia and he’s talking like that about your body. You have absolutely no reason to be unhappy with your body, and you deserve to feel happiness and self worth. You are beautiful, and seem like a good person. Fuck him."
