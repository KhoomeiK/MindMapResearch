I was thinking “well, maybe the kid in the booth snuck the video equipment in...”

My dad had an early camcorder.  It was a big camera and he had to carry the entire vhs player on his shoulder like a bag.... with a long shoulder strap.
It was not light,

I assume we also had to plug it in, but I don’t remember,"

There is nothing wrong with wanting to know someone better before getting intimate,  

It’s possible your wish to have some flings, or be less cautious is more of a fantasy than a real desire.

However, if this is something you want to be able to do, you will have to trust your judgment and gut.  If you try to push through you’ll find yourself nervous or flat out scared the whole time — and that isn’t going to be a good experience for you ... no matter how nice your partner turns out to be.
Stay sober enough to make good decisions, and make sure you tell a friend where you are going, and what time they should expect to hear from you next.

If you find yourself in a bad situation, don’t stay simply because you don’t know how to get home, etc.
Leave, and then head for civilization or a nearby home/business and ask for help.

Stay safe."
