My parents tried to pull something similar a while back. I had to write an essay and my teacher said it had to be on the computer. But my mom took away my laptop because I told my cousin to shut up when he was bullying me. I tried to explain that I needed it for school and she said ""you should have thought about that before you said that"" and wouldn't listen. I asked my teacher if I could write it on paper and he said only if my handwriting was perfect, but my writing is illegible so that wasn't going to work. There needs to be more communication between parents and teachers about this sort of thing because a lot of parents just have no idea and won't listen to their kids. I'm so sorry this is happening to you OP, but if you're 18 then is anything stopping you from moving out?"
