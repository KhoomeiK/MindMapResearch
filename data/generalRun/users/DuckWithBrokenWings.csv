BlackPeopleTwitter,ff9a9ix,t1_ff88tg0,1579708404.0,"This happens to me all the time. One of the ways I know I'm dreaming is that I'm peeing but it isn't helping. Once it's a lucid dream I don't want to wake up and I have seriously though ""just let me piss the bed so I can go on with my dream!"" but thankfully I didn't manage it."
AbandonedPorn,ff8otp3,t1_ff8o6dw,1579689436.0,"No, you're probably not, since over five people have already said it in the comments."

menwritingwomen,ff2jmjo,t1_ff2h9b2,1579509121.0,"Evan if it was true and women would actually answer to being called ""woman"" with ""are you saying I look old?"", wouldn't that be better than the ""are you saying you're a real creep who thinks I'm so irrational that I'm a whole other species than you?"" response from calling someone ""female""?"
TooAfraidToAsk,fezx85c,t1_fez8rls,1579462858.0,I feel like this is the real answer for a lot of people. The thought of being in a place where you won't have any access whatsoever to what you're addicted to must be terrifying when you're an addict.

NatureIsFuckingLit,fexzrmf,t1_fexvg0e,1579438901.0,That would make it an crosspost and not a repost though?
relationship_advice,fex41zo,t1_fewxnvg,1579423960.0,"Thank you for your answer. I was thinking that if sexual abuse was your main concern, then it would be a bigger chance of that if OP was a woman.

Yet I can't see this being seen as upsetting if OP was a woman and the kid was a girl.

I think it's important to keep your eyes open for predators, but at the same time we can't let it limit our lives too much. Young boys should be allowed to find grown up father figures and role models where their own father is lacking."

CrazyIdeas,fekh868,t1_fekgft4,1579199988.0,"Sure, but don't see it first! I've read to many comments about people who stopped watching after only seeing the first episode because they thought the rest would be like that."

""Dad, why is it so important that our left foot doesn't touch the ground at midnight?"" asks a child.

""Shut up, boy!"" The father will answer. ""This is a long tradition that you can't possible understand. This has been done for centuries and I'm sure they had a really good reason for starting this tradition!"""

tifu,fcmt883,t1_fcmrzs9,1577791121.0,"I don't agree. I had lots of questions at that age and mom and dad gave me a book with questions and answers about sex for young teens when I turned 12. It had pictures of basic masturbating toys in it and was really interesting.

You don't have to take the kids to a sex shop or show them real toys to educate them."

toptalent,fc85n93,t1_fc7hpqn,1577527406.0,This is a very autistic thing to do as many autistic kids can recreate things from memory like that. I think it makes perfect sense to mention his autism since that condition is why he was able to do it.
toptalent,fc84s0b,t1_fc7grqv,1577526870.0,"My brother's friends have an autistic child and they came to visit my parents when I was there. The kid is four or five, I think, and mom gave him a box with those magnet letters. He can't write or read but put them together to words he'd seen on TV. Mostly in English even though that isn't our native language. It was amazing!"
