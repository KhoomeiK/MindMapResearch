Less than 1% of people infected have died at this point, and though I haven't seen all the ages of the deceased I have a suspicion that they fall into the category of very young, very old, and immunocompromised. Basically the healthy public has very little to worry about at this point. The danger is that if it does spread, the lack of a vaccine means it will be a huge danger to our young children, elderly, and immunocompromised.

This has been the hardest week of my life, and it has taken a while to feel up to posting this. Bandit was the second cat my girlfriend and I got, but the oldest. We decided to adopt an older cat so that our kitten, who struggled being social, would have something she was more comfortable with to latch onto after we moved and the older cat she had became fond of had to stay behind. Little did we know we were adopting the perfect cat. I have no bad memories of Bandit aside from finding him last Tuesday morning. Our family had grown to include 6 animals, 4 cats and 2 dogs. He got along with everyone. He never left our sides, and followed us everywhere. He slept between us every night.

mentalhealth,fedxks4,t1_fedulv1,1579022018.0,"Okay, so in addition to my advice up top then, here are some ideas.

See if your school has a psychologist you can speak to. They may not be there every day, but if you can get a time to visit with them they may be able to help. Your counselor should be able to help with this.

No one strategy works on bullies. You can't count on ignoring them, standing up to them, beating them to a pulp, teachers, anything really. You can try a few things though. First off, if they latch onto anything specific about you to bully you, you can try to change that aspect. Now I'm not saying to stop being you or in any way saying you are responsible for their actions, but taking away their ammunition cna sometimes help. You aren't the one that needs to change, but that doesn't mean you can't make a situation better for yourself by changing something. Ultimately it is a cost benefit analysis only you can make and decide on.

The second thing is on how you react and process things. You didn't go into detail, about your emotional outbursts so this will be general. First off, you are allowed to be emotional and your feelings are valid. That isn't the problem, the problem is you don't feel in control. Again this is where I think a psychological would be helpful. Specifically CBT or cognitive behavioral therapy. learning how to better control your behaviors and emotions will help you express your emotions when, where and how you want to, and more importantly to whom you want to.

lastly, if your school is big enough, you may just want to try and move classes from your bully. you may have already tried this, I know counselors can be reluctant to move things around, but don't give up. The squeaky wheel gets the grease, and boy I am going to tell you how to fucking squeak. start with your counselor. go in when you are clear headed and not to emotional. check your student handbook for anything about bullying, may give you some ammo. keep a level head. If this isn't working, set up an appointment with your principal. If that doesn't work then you get to have some real fun. Look up who is on the board of trustees for your school, go to them with an outline of all your grievances and the schools inability to solve the issue. Would work even better if you can find other students in similar situations that aren't having their issues delt with. last resort if that doesn't work, go nuclear. start an anti-bullying club. you and the members document every incident. once the list is good, go to the PTA, School Newspaper, and every and any local news outlet from your local big news affiliate to the trashy Twitter wrag that doesn't verify anything. force them to act, it is their job.

oh and lastly. try not to harm yourself. you don't need to be in any more pain. instead I recommend going out and trying to do something good to get your mind off the ngs and make you feel better about yourself. pick up trash in the park, recycle, volunteer at an animal shelter. you will feel better about yourself for doing good, because you are good."
mentalhealth,fedtnpw,t3_eoncvz,1579019653.0,"Bit of clarification first. In your first sentence you say transports. Does this mean you are trans and played with members of the opposite sex as a member of that sex, or a misspelling of team sports that you mention later. Absolutely no judgment here if you are trans, but if you are I would mold my advice around that aspect of your life.

What I will say for now is that it gets SOOOOOO much better in College. I was bullied a fair bit in high school for being fat, mostly in years freshman-junior. I avoid all sorts of sports and clubs because of that. College was the opposite. All of the sudden I was popular, but I was still fat. You see kids are real mean at 11-15 and most tend to get some perspective as they age, but by then your social groups are pretty locked in and if you were being bullied, those bullys don't often break that habit. In college they won't have that habit with you, plus everyone is busy with their own shit. If your parents want you to do a sport, see if you can find something out of school that interests you. I was on a martial arts team. Any good instructor shuts down bullying FAST with some good old fashioned yelling and burpies. One of my closest friends is from that class. We both teach it now."

>What is clear from studies carried out to date is that Ca2+ influx via TRPV1 channels accounts for two forms of desensitization, although it is not yet certain whether they share the same cellular mechanisms: ‘acute’ \*Address correspondence to this author at the Institute of Physiology AS CR, Videnska 1083, 142 20 Prague 4, Czech Republic; Tel: 420-29644- 2711; Fax: 420-29644-2488; E-mail: [vlachova@biomed.cas.cz](mailto:vlachova@biomed.cas.cz) desensitization, which is a diminished response during a continuous vanilloid application, and ‘tachyphylaxis’, which is a reduction in the response to repeated exposures \[7, 22-29\].

Acute and long term

>There is one property that distinguishes the TRPV1 channel from other ligand-gated ion channels. In AMPA, NMDA, GABAA, P2X, ACh or ASIC receptor channels, high concentrations of ligand usually lead to a high degree of desensitization \[30\]. In contrast, a TRPV1 channel that undergoes complete desensitization can be strongly reactivated by capsaicin at concentrations higher than those previously used to desensitize it \[31\]. The hypothesis has been formulated that desensitization might be a functional reflection of a decreased apparent affinity of the TRPV1 receptor for vanilloids \[31, 32\]. There were three more arguments in support of this explanation: First, the onset rate of the capsaicin induced membrane currents after desensitization is slower than that before the channels become desensitized, which might reflect a decreased association rate with the TRPV1 vanilloid-binding site. Second, in the desensitized channels, the current relaxation kinetics after the wash out of capsaicin is markedly (about fourfold) accelerated, further suggesting a decreased apparent affinity. Third, a reduced ability of desensitized TRPV1 to bind vanilloids (\[3 H\]-resiniferatoxin) has been previously demonstrated in binding studies \[33\]. These indirect indications were further elaborated in great detail and extended by J. Yao and F. Qin \[34\]. Indeed, they found that the TRPV1 channel after desensitization exhibits a profound, more than one order of magnitude increase in the half-maximal effective capsaicin concentration, whereas the apparent cooperativity (expressed as the Hill coefficient, nH \~ 2) remains unchanged. The unitary current through a desensitized channel is similar to that before desensitization and the desensitized channel remains activated by depolarization in the absence of agonist: the voltages for halfmaximal activation, V1/2, before and after desensitization are comparable (145 mV vs. 152 mV), suggesting that the desensitization does not impair the intrinsic gating mechanism.

HotPeppers,fdktwki,t3_elu7wr,1578511070.0,"Here is my advice. Start by eating the hottest stuff you enjoy and eat it regularly. Find a hot sauce you like and keep it on hand for meals and what not. I did this and went from eating spicy garlic to the hottest food everywhere I eat and enjoying it. As for avoiding things to dampen the heat, it probably doesn't play much of a role in your sensitivity except for in one way. The TRPV1 receptors desensitization requires available extracelular calcium. So drinking milk and eating ice cream can't hurt your desensitization, but it may help in the long run."
HotPeppers,fdksozv,t1_fdkdvsu,1578510348.0,"Tolerance buildup isn't a feature unique to drugs. For example in allergen immunotherapy a person is exposed to larger and larger amounts of a allergen in order to decrease the allergic response. Furthermore the TRPV1 receptor, the one capsaicin attaches to, decreases activity after prolonged exposure to capsaicin.

Tolerance might not be the right word though, desensitization seems more appropriate."
HotPeppers,fdkqrkh,t1_fdkfnm0,1578509199.0,"Depends on what you want. I have a ghost, reaper, and ancho sauce I make that I put a bit of brown sugar and cinnamon in. The smell is great and it adds a good earhy taste that complements the heat nicely. Doesn't taste sweet though, I only use enough to get the flavor right.

Try adding mustard to sauce too. Either whole, cracked or powdered seeds. You can really expirement with just about anything."

You could charge 1 dollar per person you cure, and just go around the world healing people. Sure you could do it for free, but without some sort of financial backing you wouldn't be able to reach as many people. Hell even a quarter would work. Almost 2 million people get diagnosed with it in the US alone each year. Pretty sure just about anyone can afford between 25 cents and a dollar, especially compared to cancer treatment costs, and you could travel to them with the money you make."
