depression,fehp0m1,t1_fehosu2,1579121000.0,I'm good now bud don't worry. It's a momentary thing I'm sure you can relate in ways you don't even realize yet. Depression is like a hole you can dig yourself in in your mind. Sometimes you've dug too far in and you're too flooded with negative thoughts that you never think you'll see the surface again until you do. An easy trap.
depression,fdd79wx,t1_fdd6o1u,1578297956.0,I mean I felt that way in HS kinda throughout so I just made a cave for myself at home and weathered through it. All I can say is I’m 19 now and my life has changed so much over the past year. I’ve done things I’ve never thought I’d do before this young. Just realize you don’t have to be stuck in that shithole for the rest of it. I come across a lot of people day to day and there are literally so many people that there HAS to be a fit for you somewhere. You just have to find it and not put yourself in a hole.

The contained atmosphere of a small college can be daunting because everything can circle back. Try to take risks like joining clubs and things and just letting loose that part is important. It’s so easy to get tight once you pollute yourself with negative affirmations."

My friends now range from gangbangers to a gay polygamous college professor and actor who plans on doing meth again in the future. I'm driven by it and I have passion behind it, but besides this I do nothing."

socialskills,f2e7vo4,t1_f2e7hon,1570185586.0,"The unhealthy traits you describe is also a result of just the people it attracts. I've been inside of these guy's heads before their insecurities not pretty. 

I don't want to ask her out because even if friend zoned by her she's a girl at a university with other friends who are at a university so like maybe I could work something through there. Does that seem reasonable?"
