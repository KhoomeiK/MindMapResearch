I'm fine listening to people talk about what they THINK is a good way to go about life but usually they try to pass it off as the ONLY way and try to make you think that something is wrong with you, thats when it pisses me off. I may be miserable 90% of the time but at least I don't hurt anyone or try to force my views upon them. Thats one thing that really gets me is these supposed ""happy people"" seem to lack so much empathy and don't think about their actions because they know they're ""right"" and couldn't give a shit about the people they hurt with their self serving domination type lifestyles."

Anxiety,fdpn5uc,t3_emm1fl,1578633429.0,"If you're sensitive I would suggest the book I'm listening to right now The Highly Sensitive Person by Elaine N. Aron. I myself am an HSP and anxiety can be triggered by loud noises but not all noises as you yourself have stated music isn't a problem. If you aren't than I would guess its related to your past as you brought up. It really can depend on a lot of things, if you dislike confrontation like me, arguing can cause it. Like I said it could be due to A LOT of things. Introspection could help understand it better or maybe even therapy. I feel like a hypocrite suggesting therapy considering I myself won't go but it supposedly works for some people."

Anxiety,fdpbvvb,t3_emkidg,1578624753.0,"Yo, I get you. My anxiety manifests as physical pain around my heart very often and the pain can be terrible. Unfortunately I have no way of knowing if what I've done the past two times will work again or not but just mentioning its existence to friends that were with me at the time has made it go away almost immediately after. It doesn't make sense, its weird but the next time its happening (if you're near someone you trust talking about such a thing) try mentioning it and see how you feel after. I will go over what happened specifically in case you or someone else can find it useful but if you dont think it will you can stop reading.

I'm friends with my co workers (I think) and the other day the pain in my chest was just hurting A LOT and it was irritating because I felt like I was having a fine, good day even. I kept pushing on my chest with my hand and this led to my co worker asking what was up and I explained that emotional pain was manifesting as physical in my chest and that I didn't know why and explained my frustrations (to add to it it felt like I was tearing up because of talking about it which also didnt make sense)  after that the pain went away somewhat quickly, this happened again the next day. I'm sorry if that was long/unhelpful I don't understand it myself but if it works it works, no harm in trying. Good luck."

Because of reasons I don't take medication/get professional help either but with non obsessive introspection and a few self taught coping mechanisms I've been able to get by. It sounds like you're exercising, which is good, already better than me. Other things I can reccomend: taking deep breaths with your eyes closed focusing ALL of your attention on your breathing and once your mind is calm don't return to the troubling thoughts. Trying to develop a block for negative self thoughts, once upon a time I would constantly say in my head that I ""hate myself"" or ""kill myself"" or anything like that I've developed a most of the time successful block where I no longer finish those phrases in my head. Developing the block is hard and requires a good portion of mental effort but it can be done by activly saying ""no"" or ""thats not true"" in your head.

AskReddit,fdp1jg4,t1_fdozzrd,1578617790.0,"""I just want to stay friends but don't see how its going to happen"" its none of my buisness so you don't have to hear me out, its just that your situation sounds painfully similar to what happened to me. If you don't want it to become a relationship then don't let it, a relationship requires both parties to be equally invested. If you let it get to that point and its not something you want, it will fail. It isn't fair to yourself and neither is it fair to the other person. If they are truly in love with you they will be 100x more heartbroken than if you stop it before it becomes something. All situations are different and my advice may be trash but thats okay. Do what you feel is best and try not to stress, I wish you the best internet stranger."

The reason I went for it (I didn't really, they were the first to admit feelings but I was receptive) was because I fell hard in love with this person and I would have done anything to be theirs, about a year later the fall out was one of the most painful things I've ever experienced and I really just wish I could go back and just stayed friends because they were so important to me in that best friend role, now I barely trust anyone and my relationships are no where near as amazing :( hopefully my suffering can serve as a lesson to save you or others from a similar tragedy."
