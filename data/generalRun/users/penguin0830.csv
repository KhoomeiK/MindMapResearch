bipolar,fdz5ui3,t1_fdyuzu8,1578787023.0,"We all start somewhere! And even if you are bad at first, it’s all part of the process!! With writing and art I find it’s best not to focus on the result and focus more on what you’re making in the moment. Being too results oriented only makes the process unbearable!"
bipolar,fdxy9ur,t3_encbw8,1578774157.0,"Ugh I feel the SAME way. Since being diagnosed I’ve been super open about my mental health because I think openness makes us feel less isolated. 

But every time I’m open with someone they’re like “oh, I think I have that too! Sometimes I’m so sad and sometimes I’m so happy.” 
Like yeah that’s being a human.  

But I get in my head sometimes about the whole thing. Like yeah, I’ve been diagnosed by 4 different professionals, and I have people in my family who have bipolar, but what if I’m just like everybody else who THINKS they have it, but really I’m just pathetic and can’t handle life."
bipolar,fdxh4rp,t3_en9p5k,1578768660.0,"Hey! I’m sorry you’re trapped in the “nap and stuck in room” routine. I’ve spent many months of my life in that stage and it’s soooooo difficult. 

I’m not sure if you feel this way, but I always have things I SHOULD do, but I don’t have the energy levels to do them (meditate, shower, walk the dog, go to the gym, read a book). 
My therapist told me to assign an energy level for each thing. For example, showering is probably the easiest thing on the list so I’ll give that a 1. Going to the gym is much more difficult, so I’ll give that a 10. 

When I wake up, I assess my energy levels. On a bad day, I’ll wake up and think “man, I’m at a 1 today” so I look at my list and the only thing I have to do is shower. Then I can to back to laying around my room. 

However, maybe I’m feeling like a 3 - and a 3 is read for 30 minutes. So that means I read AND shower (basically any task listed 3 or lower). 

It’s really helped me not beat myself up for being “lazy”, but also helps me avoid doing absolutely nothing. 

Best of luck. Sending love."
bipolar,fdxf3ee,t3_en9ybg,1578768119.0,"Something that helps me is being productive during these episodes, so I feel like I’m using all that energy for good! 
In the past, I would sometimes sit for hours with my “big ideas” or talk friends ears off but never actually DO anything. 
Or worse I’d go out and get in bad situations. 

Once I was at a coffee shop intending to work on a short story but my manic “big ideas” kept popping into my head and I couldn’t stop chatting rapidly with my friend. She finally said “you need to put that energy into your story now” and once I actually put pen to paper I wrote pages and pages! 

It’s a scary feeling for sure, but I just try to exercise, keep my room clean, do my hobbies, stick to my daily routine, I find they pass much smoother. And sticking to my routines keeps me going once that depression comes back in. 

Wishing you the best through it all."
relationships,fbfpowy,t3_ed3pua,1576816941.0,"My boyfriend and I both work jobs where we have to be very social. The difference is, I’m an extrovert and he’s an introvert. At the end of the day he’s emotionally drained. 
We developed a system where he takes an hour to himself at the end of a shift. Whether that’s having a beer alone or with the boys, watching some TV, whatever - he gets the recharge time he needs and then we come together and talk about our day. Sometimes I meet him at the bar, but I expect him to be drained and we just play cards quietly until he recharged enough to have conversation. 
Could you set a time for yourself before reuniting and having time with your boyfriend? Decide if you need 30, 60, or 90 minutes to yourself before putting in relationship time. 
It’s worked really well for us."
