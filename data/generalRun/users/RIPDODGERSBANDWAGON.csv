The first bout of depression was severe and I’m almost not here right now because of it. I never told anyone because I thought I’d get sent to an institution and miss out on summer vacation. I hated school so much and all I wanted was summer. The second bout was less severe but featured my self esteem tanking and lots and lots of self harm. It’s not just girls, believe me, many guys, especially introverts like me deal with “girl” mental health problems."

GenZ,fffqj7p,t3_et5u96,1579889623.0,"I do miss being a little kid and being free to be myself without much backlash. I was a little odd so there was bullying, but the first 10 years of my life were really great childhood years and I’m lucky to have had them.

Then middle school started in 5th grade. I had an extremely traumatic year, a complete outlier compared to the good/great school years of elementary school and the okay/good school years of middle and high school afterwards. My childhood never really returned to complete normal after 5th grade. I behaved like a child (too much) in 6th and 7th grade, but it was never the same because I knew, especially in 7th grade that it was almost over. I had a Peter Pan phase that year, never wanting to give up my childhood, but eventually I did.

As the years went on, from 8th grade to now junior year, I’ve slowly felt more like I had to fit a mold that was tougher and tougher to fit into as each day and month went by. Obviously when high school ends it will get easier but now I feel stuck like everyone else, afraid to stand out. In childhood, none of that mattered. There were no phones and no social media to check. My sister and I got very little electronics time until we got our Wii and our DSs back in 2010-11 and even then, we still played outside like normal kids. I used to nag my parents about getting a phone and shit, but the rule was to wait until age 12. I hated that then but I’m actually happy I had to wait so long now, because I know that my parents were trying to help stretch out my childhood."

AskReddit,ff4ibvm,t3_erhu3x,1579564306.0,"This happens a lot. Usually it’s a dream that plays out like a television show. Often I’ll wake up, fall immediately back to sleep and dream an almost similar dream, and this cycle will repeat multiple times. It only works if I go RIGHT back to sleep, and don’t do anything else. Often times I do this for like 3 hours and end up greatly oversleeping.

I honestly can’t remember many of these dreams but one I do remember happened at age 15. I remember posting about it when it happened and here is the story verbatim:

”So I had this really odd dream last night (or set of three dreams) 

The first one started in my house which was far bigger than normal. And for some reason, this girl who I kinda like was there, and so was this other random girl, and my sister was also there for like a minute, idk where my parents were. But the girls and I played some video games, and then my crush kissed me, and then we went into my room and fucked. But after we fucked, the power shut off because of this random dude screwing with stuff, he was also sending the Earth back in time rapidly. Then it cut to 1776 for a split second and ended. (This was like 6 am irl) 

The second part of dream took me and my dead grandma (the rest of my family and friends except my sister were absent) back to August 25, 1957, I told my mom doesn’t back to the future come back to here? And all this random people behind my house at my pop-up pool were looking at me funny (my house was normal but it had its’ old siding). I then explained to everyone that I was my grandma’s grandson and that I was born in 2003, (keep in mind that my grandma died in May, she was 19 in August 1957 but appeared way older in the dream.) I explained to people some of the things that happened between 1957 and 2018 [this happened in September 2018 if you were wondering], but not everything because I didn’t wanna spoil it. Then it cut to my sister and I talking. We were talking about how batshit crazy it was, and I told her how I just lost my virginity and needed to save the world, her eyes went wide, and then this part ended. (This was about 7 am)

The third part took me, two of my friends, and Gordon Ramsay back to 1922. We were at a school owned by a father and son, and the grandson was a student. The father was in the cafeteria, and Gordon Ramsay went in there and yelled at them about everything that was wrong with the kitchen, and we helped him. Kids waited outside and they watched and laughed. My friends and I helped Chef Ramsay. Then my friends and I and Chef Ramsay turned our attention to the evil son, who was destroying time. We found this thing that looked like a gift shooter from those Christmas movies, but we couldn’t use it because a teacher owned it. We fought the son, Chef Ramsay yelled at him and took him to “Piss off, Donkey!” we had an epic brawl, and we won. Then my crush emerged from the shadows and we kissed and a big heart-shaped firework lit up, and then, the end. (This was about 9 am)”

Yeah 15 year old me was an oddball.

In case you are wondering, no, I never got the girl. She was way out of my league and that crush went away as quickly as it came, and by that I mean like one week.

Now talking about weird dreams, this has NOTHING on the dream about the 17 year old milk carton."

SeasonalAffective,fel4da2,t3_eo87bk,1579213797.0,"My seasonal depression has traditionally been late August to late January. The beginning is about a week before school starts and the end is after my midterms are done. This year we began August 28 and my last midterm is January 24 so there you go August 21-January 24. My seasonal depression is more associated with the seasonal changes, the first half of school, and to a lesser extent the light.

Usually the way it works is that the worst parts are the first month of school (late August/early September to the end of September), November up to Thanksgiving, and from the end of Christmas break to midterms. After midterms my mood generally shoots up dramatically. In the span of one week I can go from mopey to very happy.

This year the only bad part was the beginning to about Halloween. The remainder of the time has been better than usual, but not as good as the rest of the year.
