orangetheory,ffaubvo,t3_esixd1,1579744673.0,Have you asked her to try it with you? :) I enjoy going with my SO once I got him hooked on it too ;)
orangetheory,ff0tfsl,t3_er0tla,1579472101.0,"If I’m going with my SO, would we choose the same station rower and tread if we wanted to be partners? Or do you all think it would be more fun to have a random partner and let the universe decide for us? :) less than 6 months in on OTF and somehow haven’t done any partner workouts since my very 1st class 🤷‍♀️"
orangetheory,fejoc9p,t3_epdxft,1579181522.0,"It’s good to switch up where you start - if you always do tread first and run on fresh legs, you’d never push your legs to a jelloy point like you experienced at your class 🙃 great job!! I had like 50 splats my first class because my heart was not at all used to cardio. Now, a few months in, I have a lot more green :) hope your second class goes well"
dancingwiththestars,feinn1r,t3_epa7cn,1579142759.0,This is adorable. I didn’t know they all knew each other!
antidiet,fein9az,t3_ep2y8u,1579142502.0,"At my last dr appointment I told the nurse how much the after visit summary print out upsets me and if they could please not print it. I don’t like it calling me obese when I’m fit and have muscle - sure, some extra fat but not unhealthy amounts. She said she can just toss it and doesn’t have to give it me to if I don’t want. Apparently they do have to hit print because that is tracked in the system and healthcare as an industry is big on auditing. Maybe try that next time? Chin up, you are worth more than those numbers. Sending hugs."
orangetheory,fegh3be,t3_eov44k,1579092545.0,I haven’t done many benchmarks yet. What is the format of the class usually for this benchmark? I don’t want to burn myself out if I don’t start on tread. What do we do on the treads after the benchmark is hit since people will finish at different times? Thanks!
orangetheory,fegh019,t1_fefeulv,1579092461.0,"Bananas are good - some carbs, sugar, potassium. Make sure to hydrate. But really, that goes for any OTF class 👍"
AppleWatchFitness,fec8ymg,t3_eoce63,1578968749.0,So what is your best tip for closing the exercise ring every day? Love hearing others strategies on this
orangetheory,fe4aty9,t3_enrll2,1578857396.0,Way to go! Now you have lots of people to share with :)
antidiet,fe06gsc,t3_enfbs5,1578804270.0,"For me, after years of group and individual therapy. The mental aspect is something I work on every day - and I’ve been what I would consider in recovery for 6+ years from eating disorder behaviors. You have to deprogram A LOT and it really helps to have a person you can trust as an unbiased source of information to talk things out with. Good luck 🙏don’t forget to forgive yourself for any minor (or major) setbacks along the way. You’re only human and striving for progress, not perfection."
orangetheory,fdzqg9g,t3_enewde,1578793422.0,Ooooooooo fancy color zone markings. Girrrrl you steppin up the early intel formatting game 👏 thank you :)
aww,fdxpfnz,t1_fdxeqq9,1578771531.0,Ah! I didn’t catch the internet sarcasm. Thanks for clarifying 🙃
aww,fdx4vqo,t1_fdws4hw,1578765383.0,No need to be mean - clearly I learned I was wrong and had it backwards.
aww,fdx4dn0,t1_fdx3lld,1578765207.0,"Haha smart doggo :) not my dog though, eats everything. Ironically has food allergies :( so he doesn’t get little bits of food often, just his Rx food. It s a treat when anything falls on the floor :)"
aww,fdwj1vf,t1_fdw4vtg,1578759169.0,"Yea ok that makes sense. With my dog (he’s a rat terrier mix, we rescued him when he was 10 mo old), it seems like sometimes his nose is AMAZING and other times it’s broken. Like on a walk outside, he finds every single piece of random food the children around here have dropped. Then inside, I’ll drop a piece of something and he walks like right over it sometimes and can’t find it, even though I tell him there’s something there. How do you go about training a dogs nose? He’s 5 1/2 now - not too old for new tricks :)"
aww,fdwifr9,t1_fdvmnro,1578758973.0,"Oh man, you’re right. It’s like when I fill his food dish and put it on the counter - it’s never in the same spot on the counter, just where ever I set it down. But he saw me do it and stares at that spot  (even though he’s tiny and can’t see what’s on the counter) until he gets his dish... so what is this called then? He *has* object permanence? I mean, it’s still really funny to watch him freak out about the bone. He looks on the floor like it must have dropped because he doesn’t see it in his hand anymore."
aww,fdwh4ou,t1_fdw19lq,1578758628.0,"Ha I knew someone would try a joke about pronouns after I wrote it out. Yea yea yea, you get the gist of it."
gifs,fdvkpmm,t3_emxaot,1578748468.0,Holy cow. I am blown away. I hit a PR of 215lb in December (up from 185 the year before). I deadlift 1/week but Crosstrain orange theory and cycling. Watching this makes me feel like I’m no where near my max as a 5’3” woman and like I can go out there and lift anything. Crazy impressive lift OP ❤️
aww,fdvhhp7,t1_fduz5wx,1578747512.0,"It totally does - they’re like toddlers: no object permanence. My dog freaks out when my bf shows him his bone or a toy, then places it behind his own neck and balances it there, brings his empty hand back forward. My dog looks at his empty hand and immediately starts searching the floor and looking around like, “what the heck hoo-man? Where did it go?” He’s surprised every time my bf reaches back and pulls it “out of thin air” back into existence 🤣"
orangetheory,fdtnbjj,t3_en1y2d,1578719255.0,"$75 AUD to NSW rural fire Service 🧡 my heart breaks for all those misplaced and for all the animals we’ve lost. It’s middle of the night here and I can hear rain outside - freezing rain in January is very very unusual. This should be snow 😔 though by tomorrow it will become 13” of snow nearby. Seeing winter change here and seeing Australia on fire... it sometimes feels very disheartening and dark. I’m so happy to know this community of people who step up in the way we can by helping donate to those helping in the midst of this nightmare. Stay safe, Aussie OTF friends 🧡"
orangetheory,fd69miy,t3_ek3q9b,1578187632.0,Glad to hear there is rain 🌧 hope you get more!!! ❤️
Instagramreality,fczpx9e,t1_fcxveo6,1578106531.0,Yep
AppleWatchFitness,fcxmpnc,t1_fcxajgm,1578066628.0,"Name checks out - you’re a weenie. 

The badges are based on % for a reason - it’s all relative. If 400 is low to you, GREAT  then increase your goal Judgey McJudgerson.  400% of any goal is great. Way to go, OP!"
Instagramreality,fcxmfzi,t1_fcxle88,1578066451.0,"This woman is a plus size super model - if she isn’t “good enough” and needs such drastic edits,  man I just can’t even."
AppleWatchFitness,fcs77zc,t1_fcs6pv9,1577912409.0,"5’3” woman over here just flabbergasted haha. I hit 600 a day and that takes effort on the days I don’t go to the gym. On gym days, I hit 900-1100 or so. I’m generally very tired then... i could not sustain 1300. Good for you, dude!"
orangetheory,fcqhilq,t3_eieisj,1577886087.0,"If you plan to go 12+ times per month every month, then unlimited would be good. If you pay for each extra class beyond 8 as you go, the breaking point for value is around 12. I told myself if I’m willing to pay $139-159/mo for unlimited membership then I can just pay the $89 and go to 3 extra classes when I want (IF I want that month) and save the $ on months I only go for my 8. I also maintain my other regular gym membership with some personal training sessions to work on heavy lifting form. Hope that helps"
orangetheory,fcqg7lt,t3_eig67k,1577885412.0,I spend plenty of time in the red but am always in control so I would say - for me - it’s not dangerous. I do spend less time there as my heart gets more fit and I do agree that without the visual cues of the zones I also have a hard time finding and mostly sustaining orange zone for cardio.
veganrecipes,fb82o8e,t3_ebwrxe,1576604829.0,What does one flax egg mean? Is it combining flax and water or is there a product called flax egg? Thanks!
