Meron din sa SLMC sa QC kaso sa doctor's clinic, ok din naman but medyo pricey ang checkup pero magaling naman."

DoesAnybodyElse,ff2f2kn,t3_er75iv,1579503456.0,My sound production professor once said that it's better to cover your ears during scary scenes because it's the music or sound effects that stimulate more fear than the visuals. I was able to watch more horror movies too because of this hahaha.
