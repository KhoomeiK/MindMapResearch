pussypassdenied,fgtel2k,t3_f0amf2,1581103443.0,I feel like this comes out of the other person being bored while you are gaming and is practically demanding that you entertain them.  Both sides need hobbies and interests outside of the relationship or at least within it that they can do independently.
JoeRogan,fgsoelc,t3_f097ij,1581089173.0,Seems like this guy doesn't realize the strength of gorillas.  It would literally rip your face off.  Your 2 friends would have to die keeping it busy for you to have any chance of getting that money.
playrust,fgso3f2,t3_f08gdj,1581088976.0,Fun story.  I'm in my early 30s and was playing rust when I made friends with someone who turned out to be 15.  He told his parents he was playing with someone who is as old as his dad.  The real catch is my character in the game was female because I didn't know how to change it or care to.  So we joked that I was his wife.  Good times.
playrust,fgsnwxg,t1_fgsmwl8,1581088857.0,Solo rust is like being in a horror movie.  You know you are going to die.  I still love it though and there is such a great feeling of building a home in the game.  Sadly I don't get the same satisfaction in real life.

pussypassdenied,fgsj7rv,t1_fgs8wag,1581085709.0,The courts seem to always be 50 years behind the times.  As a father who pays child support in IL and a bullshit state calculator says I should give her half my money.  It assumes all dads are deadbeats who have nothing to do with their children.  As if I do not need to provide a home for my daughter while her mother does everything in her power to make it more difficult for me to see her.  Like lying that she is moving to one town and the day I move there to be close to my kid I find out she is going 50 miles in the other direction.  No court considers the BS women do to men as abuse.

UpliftingNews,fgn6r5c,t1_fgmz3uv,1580938761.0,Women already face not being hired because some people don't want to have to worry about them having a child and leaving for some time or altogether.  Seeing how we are all born and have parents it only makes sense to offer it.  Unless you are some alien or A sexual being posing as a human.  It is amazing to me how we can have so much wealth and offer so little to the people actually doing the work.
UpliftingNews,fgm534r,t1_fgm48x6,1580918144.0,That's why companies usually require that you work there for a certain length of time before you are eligible to receive it.  I think over all it's a great thing and anyone who would discriminate because of it should not be in a management position.
