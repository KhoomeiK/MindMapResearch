piratesofthecaribbean,ff9yfij,t1_ff985nu,1579724198.0,"Yes the ""people aren't cargo"" deleted scene... I really wish it was put in the movie.

That's why it confuse me ; Awe tells us Jack freed slaves and that because of that he was branded as a pirate and the ship sunken, but in potc 5 the ship is floating and Jack is already a pirate.

Or Beckett didn't knew about Salazar and the battle the Wench had been in and accepted Jack was the new captain of the ship and gave him the slaves to deliver, Jack free them, is branded as pirate and then the ship is sunken.. That's the only ""right"" chronological way to put it.

They weren't allowed to go on Sunday's morning because hunting wasn't something forbidden yet, but being stubborn, my grandma and her friends went anyway.

There was a small river going in that forest, and they would often go there, except that this Sunday morning there was another man here.

He tricked my grandma and her friends into following him, saying he could show them the last animals he killed. My grandma didn't had a good stranger-danger education sadly and neither did her friends, so they followed blindly.

The man bring them out of the forest, at the other side of the village where my grandma is, and literally locked them in his house, saying he was going to go fetch it.

My grandma said she panicked. She maybe didn't had a good knowledge about what to do in that situation, but she said there was something unsettling in his house ; ropes and knives where everywhere, and all the curtains were closed, there wasn't any natural light.

She said the windows were too high for them to reach so they had to take a chair to open them.

They opened it, jumped out, and ran like if the devil himself was after them.

She never knew what the fuck this man wanted to show or do to her and her friends, but trust me they never played in the middle of the forest ever again and preferred staying near of houses."

AskReddit,ff30ewg,t3_erdn0q,1579530308.0,"Both stories are from WW2 or after. I'm sorry I couldn't decide of one but they can be told as one anyway. 

My grandpa's father was a postman during WW2, and he used to tell how stressing it was to do that job in that period of time, as he lived and we still live litteraly five minutes away from Germany and there was soldiers everywhere. We don't really know the whole thing, but apparently he would've helped a Jewish family escape to Nice in France so they could hide, and was caught by the authorities. He was shot in the back of his head as he had barely open the door of his home after his work, in front of his wife and young daughter.

My grandpa (still from my mom's side) discovered he had the wrong family name like two years ago. Apparently, his mother would've had an affair with an American soldier after her husband's death, and he would've been born from them. However, his mother couldn't be with that American soldier and soon found another man (the one that has the family name of my grandpa.) His mother wrote a letter about a year before dying (a year before I was born), to tell the whole story. They only discovered it when renovating her house, and my grandpa is still deciding about doing an DNA test or whatever it's called or not, but at the same time he don't know if his mother was lying or not, and he thinks he's too old to try developing a relationship with what could be our American family. Sadly, if that's true, his real father and my real great grandfather is dead now :/

So those are the stories said in my family. What are yours?

Edit : Forgot to mention that an American contacted my grandma from my dad's side last year to give her his heritage. He said he had done some test and found out she was from his family, but my grandma didn't accepted because she was afraid they'll be debts and stuff like this. She still don't know how he found out about her, because from her side of family there isn't any American blood, only European. I hope we'll also find a letter explaining that lol"

piratesofthecaribbean,fezpnk3,t3_eolouh,1579460089.0,"I personally liked it too! 

I loved discovering a ""calmer"" version of Jack, almost as if he was normal in a sort of way. I also liked the fact they throw in a little love interest between him and Angelica, even if that's not said or show explicitly that they still love each other, I found it great the way they acted so ""naturally"" close to each other the whole movie. It's far more believable than Jack and Elizabeth imo.

What bugged me a little was not seeing or not having any mention of either Will or Elizabeth ; they were part of the main characters in the first three movies and it feels like they just forgot about them on the fourth... A tiny mention would've been cool.

It was also a little sad that the Pearl wasn't here, sure it was in a bottle, but the Pearl is the most important ship in the first three movies, actually a necessity in the third one and the title of the first one. Seeing it in a bottle was... Saddening. I would've liked to know more about how it got captured tho, the fact that the ropes went against them seems like a weak explanation, as the Pearl litteraly survived a maelstrom and the Locker before just fine. I loved Jack's reaction when Barbossa told him it was lost, it was certainly one of the rarest moment if not the only in the serie when we see Jack angry. I still can't understand why he didn't asked Black Beard to return his ship in exchange of the Fountain of Youth tho.

I also personally liked the fifth one, even if it looks and feels so different to the other. I hate how they turned Jack from the genius he was to a mere comic relief :/"

AskReddit,feuui6c,t3_eqies2,1579390057.0,"A couple of tiny weird ""glitch"" actually happened to me!

The most shocking one I ever had tho was when I literally dreamt about the attacks that happened in Paris on November 13. It was not exactly like what happened in real life, but I do remember viewing a concert room with rockers playing their music, then all of a sudden gunshots and two men entering in the room, shooting everyone. I didn't dream of the bomb, but I had a serious ""WTF"" moment when, two days later, I turned on my phone only to see news about a shooting that occurred in a concert room in Paris.

I consider this one as creepy ; I dream about a girl wearing a dress and a cloak giving food/petting a deer or either a rabbit in the middle of the day in a snowy forest ALL THE TIME. That's the dream I ALWAYS HAVE. And this dream always end up with this girl getting suddenly stabbed or shot by someone/something on her right side. I didn't thought of it for a long time, until when I woke up one morning with a pain on my right side, and noticed it was the place where my birthmark exactly was. This is creepy for me because I feel like I've actually lived this dream in real life, but there's no proof, other than the fact this girl is getting killed in the exact same place my birthmark is.

And this is not mine but I witnessed it ; once my mom had parked her car in front of an old small wall, and my godmother was at our house today to help her clean up the windows and all. My godmother then tells my mom ""the wall is going to fall, you better move the car away."" My mom didn't believed her until she still decided to move it 5 minutes later, the wall had collapsed.

I have no explanations for all that I just wrote."
