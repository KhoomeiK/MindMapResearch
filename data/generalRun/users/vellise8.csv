But there were a few who were awful. 

Story: I was subbing for a teacher who I met before I left. She was wonderful. She told me the kids are in the music room and to go pick them up in a few mins. If I had any questions to ask the teacher next door. Great. I go to the music room. Kids are gone. Go back to classroom. Kids are there w the teacher next door. She looks at me and does not acknowledge me. I feel super awkward. Next door teacher took over. The rest of the day consisted of building lego type creatures, active shooter drill, and then a movie. I just followed the kids around and tried to help. We are not allowed on our phones. So I sat in the back of the room during the movie and read my book. 

It doesn't sound like much but I felt AWFUL. I wanted to cry. I felt like dirt. I was being ignored by everyone. I had no idea why I was even there. I wanted to leave. I decided to tell the admin person at the front desk what happened. I was very upset. I called the company I worked for and left a message about how I was treated. I put the school on my ""do not suggest"" list. 

A day later my company called me b/c the school decided to put me on their ""no call"" list. I explained to the person that while I understand that the teacher next door was being helpful (in her mind) she needed to back off b/c I was the one who was ultimately responsible for those kids. I said that I understand that maybe that teacher thought I was late b/c I wasn't in the classroom when the kids came back (b/c I was in the music room looking for them like a goob). But she gave me the worst vibes. It is hard to explain a feeling but I had a very distinct feeling this teacher was treating me this way b/c I was a POC. I could be wrong but this was the vibe I got. I was emotional so I explained how I felt to my company. She immediately understood what I meant. 

The teacher also sent one of my students to the nurse. I had to stop him to find out what his name was and where he was going. They complained and said I ignored the kids and sat on my phone the entire time. Lies. 

I was upset but we had mutually blocked each other so it was done. 

This was upper middle class public school in a very nice neighborhood. This was way longer than I expected."
NameNerdCirclejerk,fdjxzb2,t1_fdjtrbi,1578491013.0,"I hate nicknames as given names. I see it a lot with celebrity kid names and I hate it. 

I like unisex names. Just not for my own kids. 

I used to really HATE this trend of naming girls traditional boy names. Like James or Wyatt. But I don't hate it so much anymore. Still would never do this to my kid though."
stepparents,fdjx4vh,t1_fdjtmq3,1578490308.0,"I know you are saying it is out of your hands but it really should not be at this point. Things have gone from bad to horrible. 

I think because you were violated by your SD YOU should be the one to set the rules for the house concerning these kids. I know this goes against stepparenting 101 but I think this may be worth a try. I think you and your husband should discuss what should happen going forward and what you feel comfortable with. But I think YOU should be the one to tell the stepkids. This will show them that things are about to change and that YOU are in charge. Even though you and your DH have agreed to the terms behind closed doors. He should defer to YOU in front of the kids. And support everything YOU feel comfortable with. 

I know no one will agree with me but the bio parents have done an awful job thus far. This is just an idea. Only if you are willing to put in a lot of work. I am not sure I would do this b/c the violation of privacy with the recordings would have sent me packing."
stepparents,fdjwhnx,t1_fdjtv4c,1578489746.0,"That is great. I am happy DH is seeing his kids for what they are. 

If my SD did this to me..I am not sure I would attempt to repair the relationship. Yes, she is 13 but that is incredibly cruel."
stepparents,fdjohgy,t1_fdj7y92,1578480888.0,"I was being diplomatic and watering the situation down bc I don't want to offend anyone. But I feel the exact same way you do. BM nvr worked when she was married to DH and only worked as a waitress for a short time until she met her current baby daddy. DH over paid CS in the beginning bc he felt sorry for her. She was a grown woman w 2 kids. She was perfectly capable of working like the rest of us. 

I am certain her current husband forced her to get a job. I believe it's a part time job but at least its something."
namenerds,fdipaxp,t1_fdi548s,1578448002.0,Love it. Thank you for that.
NameNerdCirclejerk,fdip76e,t1_fdi911o,1578447934.0,Oh shoot. I spelled it wrong. I meant the traditional spelling too. Aisling. Yes.
namenerds,fdi40l1,t1_fdht3vu,1578435337.0,"Melisende looks interesting. How is that pronounced? 

Sort of looks like a Game of Thrones character name."
namenerds,fdi3mmh,t1_fdhn876,1578435144.0,Petra! Love that name. Thought of Jane the Virgin and it made me smile.
namenerds,fdi3iwe,t1_fdhwtge,1578435090.0,"I've seen tons of Keelies, Kylies, and Kaylees. 

Not my cup of tea but v popular names."
NameNerdCirclejerk,fdi2r3j,t3_elfw3t,1578434691.0,"Trolls gonna troll. But I love Irish names. 

Ashling is my fave. And I love the spelling and the sound."
NameNerdCirclejerk,fdi25yf,t1_fdhpj7z,1578434394.0,"""Ah"" at the end of girl names are my sweet spot. 

Like Ophelia. So Rina is ok. But still..terrible somehow."
unpopularopinion,fdhc8ef,t1_fdh0n9p,1578419791.0,"I remember wow. Everyone was obsessed w that game when I graduated basic. Ppl would stay up all night to play it. Be falling asleep during class and shit. 

I nvr got into it. Too busy sluttin round tech school. Jk."
unpopularopinion,fdhae86,t1_fdgur4w,1578418823.0,"It feels shitty. I remember being a kid and feeling shame and embarrassment bc of it. But I imagine lots of first and second generation immigrants felt or feels the same way. 

Makes me sad to think back at lying or down playing my background bc I was embarrassed. 

I love my mom so much and I hate that I did that."
unpopularopinion,fdgp534,t1_fdfeqbl,1578404575.0,"I agree with this. My mother is from Zaire (the DRC) and I was born there (my father is white American and was in the Peace Corps at the time). 

It is a little irritating to see black Americans be pro-Africa when it is trendy. I was made fun of (big deal I guess) b/c my mother is African. No one was saying ""Wakanda Forever"" when kids were making fun of my African food and culture. 

I am all for knowing and embracing your culture. My grandmother was Irish.  I love learning about Ireland and that part of my ethnic background. But I would never consider myself Irish or part Irish. I consider myself American and African."
CICO,fdgmzzm,t1_fdgd3db,1578402734.0,"I did whole30 for a bit and it was the best I felt in a while. It was hard eating like that (I know its not meant to be a sustainable diet) but eating unprocessed whole foods (no sugar, wheat, gluten, and..? I forget) did wonders for my gut, skin and overall health. I having working very slowly at getting back to eating whole foods centered on plants.

I also do not partake in any diet that eliminates food groups entirely. Right now I like what the Mediterranean Diet has to offer. 

After I stopped nursing my daughter my acne flared up (and has stayed unfortunately). I am using Differin and it works for the most part but I am hoping once I change what I eat it might help my skin. Have you looked at any of the skin care boards on Reddit? /r/acne is a great source of information. 

I also have been looking at YouTube videos on clearing skin. It has given me some great ideas. And I think for ppl with eczema and other skin issues it is often connected to our gut and what we eat. (This is what my dermatologist told me, but everyone is different). 

Having an eating disorder is painful and awful. I am so sorry you are going through that."
stepparents,fdgm4lb,t1_fdft3c9,1578401937.0,BM has finally gotten a job after 5 years of unemployment. I am so happy she can finally provide more for SD rather than having her husband and my husband pay for everything. I think every family is different and they can make decisions as a unit. BUT if you are co-parenting I think that parent should be working. She should have been working to provide for HER child these years. Its great her husband was able to provide for her and her kids but I don't think it should be on him to do that.
stepparents,fdfbixo,t1_fdegzi3,1578357801.0,Ohh I see. Do you and SO live together?
stepparents,fdfbbgv,t1_fdf7qf7,1578357664.0,That is hilarious. When I was a sub I had kids ask my age I always said something crazy like 150 or 200. It was funny seeing their little faces try to figure out if I was lying or not.
90DayFiance,fdf1gw8,t1_fdeklzm,1578351159.0,That's my thinking too. Make up and hair aren't so great but she's still cute enough.
90DayFiance,fdewvxf,t1_fdehxss,1578348296.0,Ya and plus they end up obtaining tons of followers. This turns into cash very quickly with sponsorships. Anfisa explains how she makes all her income this way on her YouTube channel.
stepparents,fdeglkc,t1_fdefdtq,1578338579.0,"...?? That is bonkers. I am really glad my state does not take step parent's income into account. If they did..I don't know what I would do honestly. But I do know there is no way in hell i'd give one red cent to BM. 

I have spent SO much money on SD at this point. And its totally fine-as I adore her-but if it was court ordered-that is a completely different story."
