childfree,ffey6uh,t3_et8vpr,1579870130.0,"If my years on this sub have shown me anything, it's that childfree people generally possess a great deal of empathy and emotional maturity. 

We see children as vulnerable human beings who have the right to bodily autonomy, privacy, and a basic standard of living. We are *extremely* aware of how challenging (and expensive) raising a human being is when it's done right.

Many parents see children as accessories. Extensions of their egos. Living dolls to dress up and show off. Emotional support animals born with the job of giving their empty lives meaning. Whether they are financially, physically, or mentally capable of taking care of a child is irrelevant to them because They Want One, and that's as far as their thought process goes.

And by the way, I'm one of those people who ""hate"" children. But just because I dislike their company does not mean everything I wrote above doesn't apply. You can dislike something while still strongly believing it deserves a good life."
childfree,ffbv6pg,t1_ffbub3i,1579783855.0,"I'm just happy if I don't owe. The child tax credit is just another way people without children subsidize those who do. 

I mean I would rather owe every year of my life than have a child, but I think considering the environmental/overpopulation dumpster fire the world is now we should not be financially incentivizing having kids. Quite the opposite."
childfree,ffbuhnr,t3_esqq06,1579783178.0,">if we both decide we want a kid and can't have one, we'd be gutted

He keeps using using that ""we"" word when he means ""I."""
childfree,ffbu8fg,t1_ffbm3z1,1579782920.0,If even that. For a guy who supposedly doesn't want children he's sure coming up with a lot of ways to ensure they can have them.
childfree,ffbtyu9,t3_essef6,1579782652.0,"I always have to bite my tongue when parents crow about tax season and all the stupid shit they're going to blow my tax dollars on. You're welcome, Karen."

fatlogic,ff8um8j,t1_ff7d303,1579696642.0,"I'm part of the percentage who gained it back (more than once), but you know what? I don't regret for a second all the miles I've run or the pictures I've looked amazing in when I was taking care of myself. I was 127 pounds on my wedding day and no one can take that away from me.

I'm back in the gym trying to get back down to a healthier weight, again. The effort will never not be worth it to me. I've had emotional issues with food since childhood and that's probably something I'll struggle with my whole life but just because it's hard doesn't mean it's not worth doing.

I just don't understand the attitude of ""oh well most people gain it back so it's not worth losing weight in the first place."" It's so defeatist and such a waste of your life."
fatlogic,ff8u4xu,t1_ff7ethz,1579696166.0,"Almost every morbidly obese person I've known has died before reaching 60, and those who have made it past 60 have so many health problems their lives don't seem worth living. It's sad.

These obese 24-year-olds who are so smug about their ""perfect bloodwork"" have no clue what's in store when time catches up to them."
AmItheAsshole,ff7wlzl,t1_ff7p3mn,1579660094.0,"I don't know the age demographics on this sub but this post has really seemed to strike a chord with those of us in our late 20s/30s, because so many of us can relate to OP's coworker. You get older and all your true friends are scattered around and it's so, so hard to make new ones. Not just friendly acquaintances but *friends.* 

I just want to give the girl a hug, shit really is hard."
AmItheAsshole,ff7vwvw,t1_ff7ex8x,1579659619.0,This is so true.
AmItheAsshole,ff7vnvx,t1_ff7azsr,1579659449.0,"I felt this in my soul, I'm so sorry. I've lived in my little city over two years now and haven't made a single real friend. I tried ""branching out"" and going to a local pub meetup and it was just brutally uncomfortable, I ended up leaving early without even saying bye to anyone. It's so hard. And people like your old neighbor who have no empathy like that can made it so much harder."
AmItheAsshole,ff7ii0g,t1_ff6x7u9,1579650337.0,The sub displays a brutal lack of empathy in general.
fatlogic,ff7gpgj,t1_ff6nxo6,1579649145.0,When I was in the Army our leadership told us that verbatim. And damn if it ain't true.
fatlogic,ff7fe5v,t1_ff76m4p,1579648283.0,I lost two friends to cancer before they turned 30. It is so arrogant and privileged to act like the doctors actively trying to prevent a potential terminal illness in your body are just a rude inconvenience who are hashtag triggering you.
childfree,ff6emge,t1_ff6dx0z,1579625526.0,"I don't know why so many women waste their youth on these geezers. I have a 32-year old friend whose husband is in his 50s, they look like father and daughter in pictures."

childfree,ff5txpa,t3_erqugo,1579610120.0,All these below-average males thinking they're goddamn Henry VIII. The world will not be missing out on anything if Jason with his receding hairline and job selling cars at Bumfuckelstan Toyota does not perpetuate his genetics.

childfree,ff53ltz,t3_erjt5t,1579579297.0,"I've seen so many ""funny"" posts about mothers eating cookies in closets and stupid shit like that. It just seems like one more way your life is stripped of everything that gives you joy, even something as simple as eating a treat without some bottomless pit of need and selfishness shrieking that they want it. 

Even beyond the little kid years, teenagers are notorious for eating their parents out of house and home. I'd feel so resentful spending $$$$$$$ every week on food only for some smelly teenage shithead to eat most of it. 

Just no. No, no, no. No to all of that."

People literally create new sentient human beings because they want a doll to dress up, like there is not a single reason you could give for not wanting children that is more stupid than that."

childfree,ff4fzdj,t1_ff3sf10,1579562695.0,I joined the Army in my mid-20s and so many of my younger female military acquaintances fell into that trap. They got pregnant at 19-22 by some fuckboy and now they're all bitter single moms. It's sad seeing people torpedo their own lives like that.
