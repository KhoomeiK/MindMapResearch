dogs,ffef9bm,t3_et5zro,1579845778.0,"If you have any friends with dogs you could have them over for a doggy play date but I do think having the rescue getting use to you, your other dog and the new surroundings is a wait and see thing that is necessary. I had people over from day one with my first pup but didn't have people over for at least 2 weeks after getting my second because they needed different things."

unpopularopinion,ffbsnhx,t3_ess0ew,1579781250.0,Bending the truth to take your dog into the cabin with you is better than having to put them into the cargo where they experience drastic cold temperatures and usually are required to be medicated to go to sleep.

Dogtraining,ff8qmv3,t3_esad87,1579692041.0,A labrador is very easy to train because of the food motivation but they are usually very hyper and not mellow.
unpopularopinion,ff8io0p,t3_es8wvd,1579680248.0,I agree. If you feel like drying your ass makes the towel dirty enough that you can't use it in your face then you need to hop back in the shower and clean yourself better!

Dogtraining,ff6yxnk,t1_ff6c60i,1579637757.0,I some times use peanut butter in a kong for entertainment and treats. Double check that the sweeteners arnt bad though as some peanut butters have harmful ingredients.
Dogtraining,ff5s8t6,t3_ert9qo,1579608275.0,You could try crate training. Don't know if it will help with the howling but it can help to limit the destruction and train your pup to not do it (along with other training).
oddlysatisfying,ff244dr,t1_ff1vuwn,1579493280.0,Thanks for the tip. I did 1.5 hours rise in the tin when the recipe said 1 to 2 hours. I'll shorten it next time.
dogs,ff0j3le,t3_er2k4f,1579469356.0,"If you are worried you can call up your vet and ask them (you will need to describe what it looks like) what they think. 

I got a sheet of instructions when I was sent home after I got my pup done. The vet I went to said check daily (take photos to keep track if needed) and if there is lots of swelling or any yellow or green discharge call and discuss with us and we can let you know if you need to come in."
oddlysatisfying,ff0cu6e,t1_ff0coo9,1579467650.0,I used bread flour with about a tablespoon of corn flour as I didn't have and all purpose handy.
oddlysatisfying,ff0c2lx,t1_ff0bdrf,1579467486.0,Tasted great. A little too sweet for regular sandwich bread (just personal tastes as it isn't as sweet as McDonald buns). Great for toast though.
oddlysatisfying,ff0bwm6,t1_ff0bg2e,1579467418.0,It is a tough life I lead.
Baking,ff08o7h,t1_feyyuoj,1579466359.0,"Thanks! 
The pan I used is aprox 28x12x12 cm. 
I followed the recipe from binging with babbish in the eggs in a nest episode on YouTube (link below). Personally I needed less sugar and a cooler oven (the sugar is just my personal preference).

sydney,fexn0x6,t3_equpwv,1579433500.0,The only issue is have the the delivery bicycles is that the company's don't consider the time it takes to get to you for the warmth of the food. You get cold food half the time when it is more than 10 mins for the bicycle to make the trip.
Dogtraining,feosjkv,t3_eq8l3c,1579304798.0,I had this happen when I was toilet training my dog. He would go outside and do the little half squat to look like he peed to get treats but I just ignored it and he stopped doing it after a few days.
Dogtraining,feg7akj,t3_eozzqk,1579080376.0,"You can try putting your lab in a room seperate with their bed to get them to calm down initially and slowly introduce the other dog while keeping your dog calm. May be easier to keep them calm rather than calming down an excited puppy. Definitely tell them off when they start to annoy the other dog or when they go too far (get silly or go too rough, ect)."
unpopularopinion,fees8pz,t3_eos9gf,1579040107.0,I have to remind my SO this while eating dinner some times.
Dogtraining,fees2ol,t3_eosa52,1579040003.0,"If you did the crate training initially I would go back to the beginning of that and do that again. If needed look up or ask a trainer about how to do the crate training.

Maybe go and talk to your neighbours or give them a letter that you are training your dog to stop crying but this means there will be crying while training. You could ask if there is any particular time of day that you should try to avoid the training (incase of babies nap times or shift workers sleep schedule)."
unpopularopinion,fe6lywf,t3_enzbu4,1578895398.0,Have you ever had to clean lipstick off a cup or a glass. It helps with that too.
dogs,fe679bp,t3_enx4dw,1578883371.0,Have a blanket or some towels (make sure it is something you don't care about) to put in the crate for a comfort thing. A lot of dogs I know (though not all) like the cuddle up in a blanket or something soft when stressed. You can ask the person you are getting the dog from what your dog likes and what will be a comfort for them.
unpopularopinion,fe66owi,t3_enx7tw,1578883005.0,"I like it with only a slight fizz to it. Even the ""lightly fizzy"" drinks are too much for me and it just feels and tastes wrong."
dogs,fe66iie,t3_enx85q,1578882891.0,I had a similar issue (though the 2 dogs I have were almost the same size at the time) with the growling and biting. We ended up having to keep them seperate at night and watch them through the day with no more than 5 mins alone.  We had to teach the both that being too rough was naughty. They were just trying to play (I'm not sure if that is what you have happening) but we had to teach them to be gentle.
unpopularopinion,fdskjh9,t3_en00lb,1578704344.0,It was great in season 1 and season 2. Season 3 was okay but season 4 was crap and they had lost their touch by then.
dogs,fdsjh27,t3_en03bs,1578703918.0,"I had a trainer teach me that when there is no prior traumatic event then you can use treats and training to learn that it is okay.

You do normal training starting with sit and lay down (simple ones) and reward heavily for spring the right thing while next to the heater. If needed start doing it with the heater off and then when they have the flow of things turn the heater on during a training session. And work up to more complicated tricks and hopefully your dog will learn that all is good."

There was 2 other credit cards, a home loan, a personal loan and the ATO debt from the past 3 years."
Dogtraining,fd6sgj2,t3_ek7c88,1578195151.0,If there is shallower water it is usually less sloppy but it also means you need to top up the water every time they drink.
personalfinance,fd5xpeu,t1_fd5sq6g,1578182819.0,In Australia some types of debt you inherit no matter if you co signed it not. I know that isn't the same as all countries though.
personalfinance,fd5qdv1,t3_ek4bio,1578180305.0,Depending on the laws of where you live you may end up inheriting all of their debt in the long run when they pass away. Just something to consider when planning out all of this.
dogs,fcsofag,t1_fcqth65,1577921065.0,I use to feed my lab puppy ice cubes when we got home from walks (we live in Australia) so he doesn't choke on the water while he was panting and trying to drink after walks.
dogs,fcqk3s3,t3_eiikm3,1577887402.0,You can try feeding him I've cubes but only if the weather is warm it he is inside in a warm place.
dogs,fcgn159,t3_eh8rby,1577641839.0,"Rather than walks maybe try doing a little explore and sniff thing where you only go a few houses and work on being calm again. Do lots of commands and training so that she gets use to it all an slowly expand how far you go and how long you are out. Start with very simple commands like sit and lay down and work up to more complicated ones (if she knows them) like roll over, touch, shake. Treats and toys can help with this too."
unpopularopinion,fcd7vih,t1_fccyvr7,1577607453.0,I walk my dogs at least once a day and do training and or swimming with them every day too. They get enough exercise but walking isn't always an option.
Dogtraining,fbtidd4,t1_fbt6a2o,1577079965.0,Maybe but I don't think so. She has no toys and no stimulation for more than 50% of a day. She lays about for a lot of the day. She gets excited for some things and it is noticeable as her collar jingles a lot but it dosn't seem to happen with the destruction.
