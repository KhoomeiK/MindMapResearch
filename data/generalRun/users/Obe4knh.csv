todayilearned,ff74mef,t1_ff5e4tx,1579641024.0,"Sorry, to be clear, I pretty much completely agree with you. I meant that better defensive players are a contributing factor to the dead puck era, not the sole cause of it, in addition to a lot of the things you listed. 

>A stat becoming a thing does not mean the thing did not exist before that point.

I don't mean that blocked shots weren't a thing before they became a stat. I do think the fact that it's tracked now is indicative of a larger trend towards better defensive play.

>Defensemen are different now and the coaching and systems and rules and equipment are too.

Absolutely. Systems like the trap, better goalie equipment and changes in goaltending style, certain rule changes all have had a hand in it. I was just noting that I think defensive play is far better than it was pre-1995. This is pretty subjective, I absolutely could be misremembering things because 10 year old me had less understanding of the game than adult me, and I don't think there's any specific thing I can point to that definitively proves defenses or defensemen are objectively better now than they were then, just my observation."

Better patio options. I like bringing my dog out for brunch or happy hour and it severely limits my options.

I don't think you can really count JoJo's, Isabella's, Orchard, Hootch, or White Rabbit as legit patio options, though they all have outdoor seating.

Rooftops. Brewer's struck gold with that, I hope we can get more going there. I'm just not sure how feasible it is with the current infrastructure. I know there's the plan for the bank, but that's super ambitious and I'm skeptical it will end up happening."

Expanding highways just results in....more people using those highways, so the traffic doesn't really get better. It does need to happen at some point because we just have too many people up here, but honestly if we're going to expand 270, we also need to install a better public transit option than MARC to get at least to Gaithersburg. Metro would be ideal, or some other light rail. Sadly I doubt both get approved and I think both need to happen for it to be really effective."

Or just visit us!"" Frederick has been growing more and more popular over the last 10-15 years, thanks largely to the development of downtown. People are starting to figure out that it's not Fredneck anymore. The city regularly holds pretty cool community events that attract people to the city, there's a huge emphasis downtown on local businesses, and it just doesn't feel like a planned community like some of the places in Montgomery County, because it isn't. For those of us that live here and work in Montgomery County, the only appeal for us to live in MoCo is a shorter commute, which given the daily hell that is 270, would be nice, but it's not worth the tradeoff in overall quality of living in my opinion.

You can obviously tell they're heartbroken and agonizing over making this decision. But the fact is, while most dogs can be rehabilitated, not all can. The idealism is in thinking that you can save every dog. There aren't a lot of people out there that are equipped or willing to take a dog that has this level of reactivity and aggression, and given his fearfulness and anxiety with being away from his human, you can at least forgive the fact that OP is considering euthanizing him while OP can still be there for their dog when he goes instead of having him euthanized far away in the arms of a stranger who isn't equipped to handle him.

OP has given him 6 years that the dog otherwise wouldn't have had and has tried every reasonable method of behavior management available, and his dog can't be trusted around children while they are dating someone with a child. Frankly, re-homing a dog like this is downright irresponsible if you're not 110% certain the person you're re-homing him with is fully equipped to handle it, and most people are not in a position to do that. If you know that person, go for it, and if you are that person, good on you, because you know how difficult it is to manage these issues, but this idealism is extremely naive."

But for my situation, I'm not sorry at all! I love the guy a ton and honestly, doing so much work with him has not only made me bond with him more than any previous dog I've had, it's made me a better dog owner. I actually knew he had some aggression before I took him in, so I wasn't going into it completely blind, though I very much underestimated the severity of it. If I were in your situation, I would have done the same thing. Mine is kind of an ideal living situation for him, I'm a single guy, no kids (and don't plan on them), no other dogs currently, so it's about as low risk as possible under the circumstances. If I do ever decide to have kids though, I'll have a very difficult decision to make, because I absolutely won't be able to keep him and it will be very difficult to rehome him with someone equipped to manage him responsibly.

Fortunately his only bite incident with me was about a month after I got him, he went after my dad and I was able to get him off relatively quickly before the damage was too severe, though it did require an urgent care visit. We've been working with a behaviorist for the last few years and he's shown very few signs of aggression since, so he's made tons of progress, but it's one of those things that you have to stay vigilant about, and for the vast majority of people, it's just not a good situation.
