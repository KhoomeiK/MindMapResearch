Metallica,felex8p,t1_feharvm,1579220567.0,Im getting quite a lot of quality stuff from the Metallica soundcloud channel.
todayilearned,fdlg9ya,t1_fdl45e8,1578523382.0,"Obviously, you have a valid point. Although there is still a lot more at play here than just making money. My point is that they learned. They dont' hunt down other users who share Metallica recordings. If you go on soundcloud and look up Metallica, all the songs are there. If you look up muse for example, it's always somebody's cover, nobody else can upload a record of the actual songs it is taken down. But if you look up the Movie through the never, it's there on Youtube. 

I recently heard they bought the rights to their own material. It gives them the freedom share whatever they want on whichever platform they want. It keeps them accessible to their fanbase. Maybe Youtube does give a revenue, what does soundcloud give? Lot of known bands won't even dignify the platform. But soundcloud is a decent platform for music, and so far doing well enough to still be around. 

I listen to my music on soundcloud, I don't use spotify, or keep Youtube on all the time. Soundcloud works without a screen on, you can make your playlist and go about your day, find some nice otherwise unknown artists. 

But once in a while i look up a known band,all I'll get will be :30 second tracks, or not available in your country(Northern Europe). Metallica has a ton of music on their own channel. They are accesible to me, and they haven't locked off their music. When I feel like listening to some old school metal I enjoy them. 

The fact that I can't access Rage against the machine on soundcloud but metallica has opened up a whole library of performances is really amusing, definitely would have guessed the other way around in 2003."
todayilearned,fdlcn5e,t1_fdl5gnp,1578521175.0,"If this link comes with the playlist - it does in the browser-, you can give me your professional [opinion.] 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abe3AZhcGQs&list=OLAK5uy_n25RoP6-HEs3-K49PDy2uu-RvpYSzHDrg&index=8) There are 6 remastered tracks up at the start. One of them is an early garage demo from 1985 though. 

I quite enjoy watching live performances and I'm grateful that they release their own. Seriously, I can never see one announcement at the right time. I always see the concert either when it's sold out, or after it has already happened. When they come to Denmark, they play numerous times. I manage to miss all them. The first one that I noticed was 5 day-tour."

todayilearned,fdl1xuk,t1_fdl1594,1578515645.0,"If I'm not mistaken, there are remastered tracks too."
todayilearned,fdkwq8i,t1_fdkv26z,1578512735.0,"They learned from it. Their official soundcloud and Youtube accounts are FULL of great recordings and live performances, and some remastered stuff. You can listen to Seek and destroy from a 1984 recording on soundcloud."
PublicFreakout,fclasf4,t1_fcl1lgn,1577743539.0,"I wouldn't think so, not at all. Apparently [This photo by James Robertson] (http://www.agababaexpressdoner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/donerin-tarihi.png) was taken in 1855 in Istanbul. 

But the way döner is served in Europe is quite unique to Europe. In Turkey, you'd get the meat, some tomato slices,red onion, little bit of salad. That's it. Proper döner wouldn't even need additional salt. 

But in Europe they serve it with a ton of green salad and a ton of mayo or creme fraische and the portions are huge. It has sort of transformed according to the local demand I guess."
PublicFreakout,fcl12dq,t1_fckymfs,1577737502.0,You are most welcome. Could you maybe tell me about the variations of tacos?
PublicFreakout,fckx0re,t1_fcktfw4,1577735013.0,"Kebab actually means recipe of making  a grilled meat dish. Every region has a different kebab recipe. 

 You make skewers,then it is shish kebab.

 You stack steaks and fat in the shape of a cylinder, put it upright, put a rod through the center and rotate it while grilling it on one side it's a  doner/shawarma/ gyro.

 You  spread doner over flat bread and top it with a tomato/sweet paprika butter sauce: iskender (alexander) Kebab.

You take some minced meat, spice it up and wrap it around a loong wide skewer ( more like a huge knife) and grill it, it is Adana Kebap. 

You take that Adana kebap, wrap it in a wheat wrap,  bake that a little and serve it cut-up into large bites, with the tomato butter sauce, it's a Beyti kebap.

You take minced meat, cook it up nicely with some onion pepper tomato and spices, spread that over slow cooked aubergine puree, Alinazik kebap.

In short, there are lots and lots of kebabs. gyro/ doner/shawarma is one fast food version."
