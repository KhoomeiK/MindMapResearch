BreakPoint,fe5heqb,t3_enrkwg,1578869457.0,Another old fart here. That's all I was running was faction missions (PS4) until Ubisoft disabled the rewards. My online team and I switched over to Modern Warfare

BreakPoint,fdfc9i6,t1_fde5veg,1578358294.0,"(PS4) Press L2 to aim down sights until your target is selected, then x to sync mark. If x doesn't work, tap L1 while holding on target with L2. Target should be selected. On my game, this now takes me out of sights to over shoulder view. If this happens, R3 puts you back in ADS. Repeat above to select up to three targets, then hold in L1 or shoot someone else to sync shot all. 

Took me a while to work out but now I have no issues with it"
modernwarfare,fda50js,t1_fda3cro,1578241764.0,"Just curious, as we haven't found a reliable source. When in crossplay, how can you get the party audio to work reliably? Most of my friends are using PS4 with a couple Xbox guys. One or two that we link up with are on PC, but the PC guys always have issues. They're not muted on either end, crossplay is enabled on both sides, but yet we can't hear them. They can hear us. Occasionally a reboot solved the issue but not always. Have you seen this before and if so, how was it resolved?"

DIY,fct5j32,t1_fcsxsgq,1577933420.0,"Second this info. Also, drill test holes if you're not sure you're in a stud. Use a 1/8 bit so the holes are small and mark the ones where you hit wood. Doesn't matter if the top lag bolts line up with the bottom - they'll be behind the TV so you'll never see them"
