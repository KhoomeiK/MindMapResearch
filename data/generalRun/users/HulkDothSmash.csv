I had a bad fall where I broke my face and skull, went 3 years with a broken jaw that could have been fixed had the military any competent surgeons. Struggled with addiction to pain killers. Lost my dream job. Lost my family. None of that compares to the deep sadness I felt when our own army launched a Patriot missile at our base. The immediate realization that we send teenagers to war and they have no idea wtf they’re doing, fighting other misguided people with no idea what they’re doing, just haphazardly blowing shit up to eliminate a threat created by the people that sent them there. It hurt so bad to feel used and misled... and missiled. You’ve got old white men fighting old brown men with armies they convinced were fighting for themselves. I felt pathetic."
