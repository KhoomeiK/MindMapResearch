Futurology,ffg5nqo,t3_et7pc6,1579898985.0,"Here’s the conundrum regarding support for this. First, you can’t just shut everything down at once. How will Greta make it back to Sweden with her $46M+. 

Second you are looking at shutting down a lot of industries, not just oil and gas without a safety net for the employees. Again, we can’t all come from rich families like Greta. 

Third, most of the world believes in climate change, we aren’t the backwoods ignorant boobs that you make anyone, that may have a different opinion on any part of this, that you try and make us out to be. Reality gets in the way. 

Which brings me to four, people have to work and most of the adult workforce anywhere relies on oil in one way or another, whether you work in the industry, or in an office or are a farmer. We all use products made from petroleum products. Whatever you are reading this on has petroleum products. Now I was talking about working. Unlike Greta and her celebrity friends, most of the rest of are a paycheck or two from being homeless. It’s easy for many people who do t have families to take care of but fir the rest of us, we are more concerned with keeping our shitty jobs so our families can have a place to live, clothes to wear and food to eat. Then along comes the Greta’s this world demanding that we shut everything down and put millions, no billions, out of work. Are you and Greta going to help any of these people? I doubt it. Even the  millennials and gen z will be out of work. 

How do we get food from the farms to the cities. As of yet, electric semis don’t have the legs to go from my rival location to the nearest cities. Then there’s the farmers. They aren’t going to produce much with a team of horses to pull a plow. No one is working on electric tractors.  In North America, especially the US, even if you have an electric vehicle, you are getting your electricity from coal fired sources. 

Now I digress. Take your average person who is a month or two from being homeless. Their only thought is that of taking care of their family and worrying if his job will be outsourced to some sweatshop in Asia. It’s going to be hard to get that person to worry about 2050 when they are worried about the next month. 

It’s nice to scream, cry and gnash your teeth, but until you answer the pressing questions about replacing jobs, finding suitable non petroleum products to manufacture our goods and get our food to the city, you aren’t going to get the average person behind you. 

Both sides need to look at the other sides’ point of view or nothing will happen. The Greta’s will cry and the working people will ignore her. 

To answer your next question, no I don’t have much respect for Greta. Her handlers did a good job but she has no answers as she creates a carbon footprint bigger than most of us netting around the world to put on her little show. She makes lots of demands without accomplishing anything tangible. While, there are teens out here with great ideas like how to clean up the plastic island in the Pacific or removing micro beads from our waters and are accomplishing great things, scrambling for funding to achieve these goals while the Gretas of this world do nothing but make noise bit has no real solutions but celebrities and rich do gooders their millions at her for yelling at Donald Trump.

My grandchild was given to me because she was severely neglected. The mother would take off for hours or overnight so she could go out drinking and pick up men at the bars. 

She would bring these men home with her and have sex in front of the child and also leave her alone with them as well. When we got her we brought her to a doctor for a full check up.

Unfortunately, it only takes one bad apple to ruin it, as we saw with our children. There was one teacher who couldn’t teach and didn’t  understand what he was teaching (in university, he specialized in PE). He was so bad that they took him out of the classroom and made him a resource teacher. He couldn’t handle that so they made him a principal. OMG, under him almost all the teachers either quit or asked for transfers. Then they made him some kind of substitute principal where he couldn’t affect the schools or children. 

And, yet, the school board is too lazy to do the paperwork up to fire him or even start by counselling him. This person shouldn’t have ever been allowed near a school. 

Also unfortunate is that he considers himself to be a farmer first and a teacher second which means that his priorities are skewed. 

We partly blame the universities curriculum because they don’t seem to be teaching teachers how to teach, what an IPP looks like, how to deal with problem children and parents, you know, the bread and butter of teaching. Most of it seems to be the history of history, the history of science, how education was developed over the centuries but little about teaching. At least that university education teaches it in Canada. 

When I was in the army, we spent months teaching instructors how to teach and deal with the classroom and evaluating them before they even set foot in the classroom. 

Had they done that, perhaps in this case, he would have chosen a different profession or been squeezed out through attrition.
