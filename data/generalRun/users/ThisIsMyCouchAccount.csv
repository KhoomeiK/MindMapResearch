You absolutely can. Being social is a skill you can practice.

Next, realize that shyness and introversion are not really related. Introversion is more about how you manage yourself after interacting with people.

You are the self you choose to be. ""You"" are not a finite thing. All of your behavior is your behavior by definition. You can never not be yourself. So, you've got something else going on.

Finally, you need to realize that everything is on a sliding scale. You don't have the center of attention to be social. Be friendly. Smile. Ask questions. Remember small talk is the talk that happens before you know somebody."
