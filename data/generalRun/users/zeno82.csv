And Sondland is a huge Trump fan who paid a big fee to Trump campaign for his ambassadorship, and openly testified there was a personal quid pro quo and it was a shame that Trump was refusing to meet with Zelensky until the announcement because he thought they would get along famously.
And Sondland didn't give up that information until he realized he could be charged for perjury after others' testimony.  Which just reinforces the allegations even more.

And sorry, but please tell me how having a personal lawyer and his clients/associates - not even paid by Trump or US Government, but by Russian oligarch Firtash (who we should want extradited) - conduct business and solicit bribes by illegally witholding aid from our foreign ally is remotely legal.   All evidence points to Trump campaign merely wanting an announcement of an investigation on Biden, not an actual investigation.  And if they did want an investigation, they wouldn't use shady personal lawyers and Russian criminals to conduct the investigation.

Sorry, but no, ordering executive branch heads to outright ignore - not comply with nor contest - impeachment subpoenas is not normal.  And it's clearly unconstitutional and impeachable.

And there's a little thing called the The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 that Trump clearly violated for personal gain.  It was absolutely illegal and corrupt for a President to co-opt our established Congressional funding and illegally withhold vital military aid to our ally who gave up nukes for our protection in order to solicit a bribe.  

And he withheld it not for the nation's benefit - just an announcement of an investigation on his primary domestic political opponent.  

He did not get Congressional approval to withhold aid he has no say over after the certification process completes.
Pentagon warned him that what he was doing was illegal and he plowed ahead anyways.  Trump team has offered zero exculpatory evidence or compelling legal arguments.

If Trump was on the up-and-up, why was his personal lawyer - paid by pro-Russian interests currently awaiting trial and not even by Trump - interfering with established foreign policy to solicit a bribe?
Why wouldn't anyone that can exonerate Trump be willing to testify under oath?"

Very smart, very trainable IF she's in the mood to be trained.

She escapes easily but somehow recognizes our property lines and usually stays within them, and always comes to me when I call.  I suspect she is protecting chicken coop of neighbors a few doors down at times.

She also doesn't run far off and only seems to do so in certain types of weather.
She refuses to eat her food on the patio until I either hug her first, or leave to go back inside.  She loves routine.

nextfuckinglevel,fcm8kq2,t1_fcm7trm,1577767121.0,"This is an excellent point!

And most people selling guns at a gun show would indeed be doing so as a means to make a profit, or it's their general business overall.

With that said, it's not always cut and dry like that!  If you are not buying guns with the intent to resell them for a profit, you can remain unlicensed.

There's still people who go to gun shows that are NOT exhibitors and engage in private sales.
Maybe they just want to buy or sell 1 or 2 weapons.  
As long as it's not their day-to-day business, they do not need a license IIRC.

Technically, if someone has a huge gun collection they inherited and they just want to get rid of it all at fair prices without a middle-man getting a cut, they could sell off their massive collection and be 100% in compliance with the law without even doing background checks on purchasers.

(Now... if they used that money to buy and resell more firearms at a profit, ATF/IRS can get them)

There's also plenty of private sales on online marketplaces (although some will require a FFL to ship to)."

7% purchased under their own name from a licensed dealer.
So even if we remove those, that's 3%.  Not sure where 0.2 comes from.


0.8% from solely gun shows.

43% from off street or underground market.

25% from friends or family, which can include private sales.


Thanks for the heads up on one place to look!

Here's a paragraph for anyone else that's curious:

> An estimated 287,400 prisoners had possessed a 
firearm during their offense. Among these, more than 
half (56%) had either stolen it (6%), found it at the 
scene of the crime (7%), or obtained it off the street

purchased it under their own name from a licensed 
firearm dealer.
