Drop any relationship you want, and use your passive aggressive tactics to ask us a question that we CANT disagree with, bc that's what you did.

You literally admit that you complained about how busy Costco would be when the entire point of getting the dishes was to get them for that price.

 And then you offered yourself as a martyr on the stake to just spend more money on the dishes.  But the whole point  was the great price, it's what both your mom and she cared about.!

 That's why she went and got them, because you were being a whiny martyr about what their entire reasoning was to go.   And made her do the waiting during their busiest season!

Just do your mom the favor the way she wants it done without complaining about it on social media, and then you will have done a favor for both of them.

Instead your passive aggressive martyr self made everyone know you were doing this bc you're such a good person.

Tell you what, if you think I'm wrong, ask 3 people who love you, including husband, if I might be just  a little bit right.  Although they may lie bc they dont want go deal with any games  with extreme passive aggressive costs either.

I'll say this though.  If MIL is in a position where she needs an apartment,there's a good chance you're going to eventually be at least pitching in on one anyway eventually, as you're not going to let he be homeless if you have the means.
