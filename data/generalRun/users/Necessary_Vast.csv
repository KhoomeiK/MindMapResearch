MealPrepSunday,ffvh47a,t3_evech2,1580263978.0,This is now my favourite meal prep ever
blogsnark,ffv24sq,t1_ffr8o7u,1580253933.0,"yes! I don't really like babies but I give a generic, ""Awww, how cute!"", smile and chat a little bit and then go back to my computer. I'm sure most new parents know that not everyone is as keen to see them but it's part of the social contract."
bulletjournal,ffuxjlr,t3_ev7vi1,1580251243.0,I really love this! I might also adapt it--I'm not creative or good at drawing so I really enjoy the minimalist spreads like this one.
Wellington,ffux30j,t3_ev37q6,1580250993.0,"He's so cute.....one day, I will meet Mittens myself."
Wellington,ffuwfsu,t1_ffuosqm,1580250631.0,"I used Cool Moves based on several friends' recommendation and they were excellent. Not cheap but well worth it for the speed, skill and friendliness."
Wellington,ffuwca3,t1_ffuqxh3,1580250578.0,I'm so happy your session went well! A good therapist can help so much.
bulletjournal,ffpan03,t3_eu8r6v,1580090312.0,I LOVE this.
Wellington,ffjbx0c,t3_etntcc,1579995062.0,My partner takes several classes at Spiritus and really likes it!
horror,ff80761,t1_ff7ytum,1579662591.0,The way it was always in the edge of the screen hanging over Termina was so effective. And the music speeding up frantically in Clock Town as the destruction grew closer
horror,ff7yi6b,t3_es54hr,1579661390.0,"Honestly, Majora's Mask. That game was so unsettling and eerie but I loved that atmosphere."

Wellington,ff7d8ki,t3_erxjsa,1579646860.0,"About four hours sleep......save me, coffee."
Wellington,ff7d73o,t1_ff77y4y,1579646833.0,Congratulations! That's fantastic--I'm so happy for your brother.

MoneyDiariesACTIVE,ff5lywx,t3_erqv6s,1579599447.0,"Wow, I also make $52k nzd! what a coincidence lol. I think it's also important to remember that currency fluctuates and that the nzd is really weak right now, even compared to two years ago. At least we have ACC and cheaper healthcare so that's a huge chunk of budget we don't have to worry about. We do have much more expensive groceries..../cries on my avo toast

I find it more fun to see the amounts in the original currency with usd figures in brackets, just so I have a rough idea of ow much it translates to."
MoneyDiariesACTIVE,ff52g3y,t3_ernv9x,1579578407.0,Interesting! The only question I was wildly off on was how much the 10% have--I overestimated since I grew up in the USA and now live in New Zealand.
BasicBulletJournals,ff3trkl,t3_erej0s,1579548673.0,"Tons of people have left great comments but I highly suggest trying some good burritos and dumplings! There’s tons of fantastic places all over town. 

If you don’t mind going off the beaten path a bit, the Richmond neighborhood is sort of like a less touristy Chinatown. It’s almost all locals and have some great places, including a cute ice cream place called Toy Boat. There are also some good Burmese and Thai places nearby"
newzealand,fep2ppz,t3_epw8ix,1579310807.0,Congrats! It feels so good to get outside after dealing with mental health stuff. I'm so happy for you
newzealand,fel27d0,t1_fekzrxs,1579212457.0,Definitely! It's a bit frustrating sometimes dealing with the shorter hours but it's worth it so people get time off. And its lovely how much everyone here doesn't expect you to be married to your job. Plus all of the official holidays they HAVE to give you off was a mind blower for me
newzealand,fel0djt,t3_epfz05,1579211362.0,"I bought a house recently and I did a lot of the things you're supposed to do--make your own meals, don't go out often, etc. And guess what? The only way I was still able to buy was loans from both my parents and my in-laws and my spouse getting a huge raise for a 6-month secondment. 

It's bloody hard getting a deposit together and living in misery for 10 years shouldn't have to be the answer for most people."
bulletjournal,fekz9s9,t3_epodgs,1579210702.0,"Wow, that is absolutely beautiful!"
newzealand,fekz8h2,t3_epmszu,1579210680.0,Kia ora from another american who moved to NZ! It's great of you to learn te reo--I can still only do a few phrases. The pace of life here so much nicer.
intermittentfasting,fekxlhs,t1_fekarzx,1579209699.0,Thank you! I'll have a hunt around for them.

Wellington,fekxfdx,t1_feklnex,1579209595.0,good luck! I hope it goes well and that you enjoy the sun today

MealPrepSunday,feiuq2x,t3_ep7m6q,1579147731.0,That is an amazing title lol
intermittentfasting,feiks7t,t3_eou3nj,1579140836.0,"How do you track calories when you make things from scratch? For example, I made a soup the other day from the leftover ingredients in my pantry and I'm not really sure how to break that down."
Wellington,feikjlq,t1_feidbkz,1579140675.0,I used to live in San Francisco and nobody thanked the drivers there ever. It would be seen as really weird if you did.  It was a big adjustment for me to remember to say thank you every time when I moved here!
Manatees,feik6sn,t3_epb3p6,1579140430.0,Thank you for posting these pictures! I love seeing them
bulletjournal,fei7s3r,t3_ep04xt,1579132182.0,I LOVE the hamster sticker
Wellington,fei6ng0,t1_fehwewc,1579131462.0,It went really well!! It helped that there was barely anyone there but I learned how to use a few more of the machines.
Wellington,feextfw,t1_feevqz2,1579043564.0,"That's a great idea! I'm actually going tonight, I'm gonna do that before this evening. I really appreciate the encouragement."
Wellington,feeuodx,t1_feetiyc,1579041599.0,"Thank you! I've only done a few trips but I do feel so much better after each one, even if it's just some cardio and a few weight machines. I will keep that in mind when I go."
Wellington,feetof7,t1_fee3bc6,1579040981.0,"Wow, I'm really impressed you were able to make it through! At least the long weekend is coming up to sleep in :)"
Wellington,feetede,t3_eoo0sg,1579040811.0,"Just started going to the gym and still have the newbie nerves and feeling a bit intimidated. Trying hard to push past it--any form of exercise is better than nothing, even if it's not the best routine ever, right?"
Wellington,fe6c63d,t3_enk6fv,1578886703.0,"It's definitely more negotiable! When I was renting, offering to pay for carpet cleaning at the end of my lease really helped convince landlords."
Wellington,fe6bzek,t1_fe54lpw,1578886565.0,hello fellow lurker!
blogsnark,fe6bqwe,t1_fe4xdyu,1578886389.0,me too!! I put it on in the mood for trash but I ended up binging it. I love Karyn--it's really nice to see a butch lesbian on the program!
Wellington,fdeks0l,t1_fdejt9e,1578341123.0,Terrace Medical Centre is really convenient—you do have to wait for your appointments and it’s not too flash but I’ve been happy with my service there.
Wellington,fcl6kq3,t1_fckp2pb,1577740906.0,"I've bought a house! Still can't quite believe it, really."
MoneyDiariesACTIVE,fckz1yv,t1_fcjhfco,1577736259.0,"Seriously! The prices of groceries are so much cheaper abroad. And cheese here, even if you spend $50 on halfway decent stuff it still doesn't get you much."
