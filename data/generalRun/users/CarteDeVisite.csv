AmItheAsshole,ff7ke23,t3_erwpm1,1579651626.0,"Absolutely NTA. You brother and his GF are gigantic AHs. What I’ve gathered from your post and comments boils down to your brother and his GF berating and ganging up on you for feeding their daughter high quality food while you’re watching her for FREE, they refuse to send her a packed lunch and expect you to go out of your way to buy shittier food to feed their daughter so she won’t prefer fresh fruits and vegetables. This behavior is disgusting and problematic. They value their pride over their daughter’s nutrition. I understand that it really sucks that she is being picky and doesn’t want to eat what they can afford but she’s 3, 3 year olds are often picky and difficult.

Edited to add that I grew up in a household in which fresh food was scarce and money was tight. I understand that not being able to afford fresh food isn’t only about money, but about the time and skill that goes into preparing it, especially to get a toddler to eat it. It’s heart breaking that their child won’t eat the food they can afford but they’re cutting off the nose to spite the face in this situation."

This is a minor thing and it sounds like you weren’t deliberately trying to go behind your ex’s back. It’s a very common thing in western culture so why would you assume he would flip out? I didn’t get my ears pierced until I was in middle school because no one ever took me. My parents didn’t forbid it, they were just working parents who didn’t have the time to accompany me to the mall or pharmacy to get it done. You’ve pretty clearly implied you didn’t know this would lead to such an escalation. Everyone Y T A-ing over their assumptions of your custody agreement and saying you aren’t a parent because you don’t have full custody is so fucked.

I understand why people are going w E S H because ultimately your 12 yo daughter shouldn’t be going to bed hungry but the reason she’s going hungry in the first place is because your husband ATE HER FOOD OFF HER PLATE. Your husband is a giant AH. He needs to make her more food or go out and get her something ASAP.  I don’t understand why you’re the petty one when he refuses to make some more food for your daughter because...why? He he doesn’t want to? Why does that fall on you? You didn’t create this situation, he did. He’s an adult who ate a child’s meal and left her hungry, then expects someone else to take care of it. You demanded he rectify the situation that he caused then he calls you petty for it, none of this would be happening if he exercised a modicum of control and didn’t eat all of your daughters food OFF HER OWN PLATE. What is wrong this supposedly adult man that he thinks it’s appropriate to eat most of his daughter’s dinner and then expects you to cook for her? He sounds like a he’s a greedy pig. This is so beyond ridiculous. Encourage your daughter to not allow him to eat most of her food off her plate, stand up for her when you see him doing it, and make him get her some more food now!!"
AmItheAsshole,ff44i44,t3_er2mhk,1579555354.0,"YWBTA. I don’t think getting your own account is a bad idea but siphoning off money from your husband is. I think it’s always good to have your own finances in addition to joint accounts with a partner, even if you’re happy and have no plans to leave. You can be totally open with each other regarding statements to make it feel less...sketchy? That’s not the right word exactly but it’s hard to prepare for worst case scenario in a relationship when you’re happy. It doesn’t mean that you doubt the longevity of the relationship but it’s hard for it not to seem that way when you’ve shared finances up until this point. Honestly, I think having money spread across a couple accounts isn’t a bad idea incase of someone nefariously gaining access to your bank account or investments. 

You could pick up some part time paid work in order to build up your own funds. Maybe look into monetizing a hobby of yours part time, like calligraphy, working at a garden center, or dog walking. Look into investing if that interests you or gaining certificates. Be honest and open with your husband regarding all of this and hopefully you guys can come to a healthy agreement."

HaircareScience,fetm8dn,t1_fet38q9,1579376820.0,"My hair gets a lot drier in the winter so I use a heavier deep conditioner. Cutting your hair could help if you have split ends and significantly higher porosity at the ends of your hair. 

I don’t think it’s necessary to limit wash days unless that is when your hair is the driest. Everyone’s hair is different but in my experience, my hair gets drier as I go longer without washing because it’s med-high porosity. I wash it 2-3 days per week. I seal in the most moisture from wet styling immediately after showering. 

Maybe try a gentler shampoo if your hair feels really dry after wash days? Protein overload can also cause hair to become brittle and rough, it might be worth it to look into the protein content of your current stylers to see if you could benefit from switching some stuff out for the season if this has been a recent issue."

Heat tools reach much higher temperatures than your shower. The hottest flat iron I’ve ever owned reached 300 degrees F. That was 15 years ago, I wouldn’t be surprised if flat irons reach hotter temps now. Hair dryers reach 140 degrees F (according to Google.) 

Exposing you hair to water temperatures that are less than 20 F hotter than body temp is unlikely to cause much damage compared to flat irons and curling irons. Blow drying isn’t as extreme in temp but can still be over 30% higher in temp than your average shower temp."

The fact that you’re expected to drive so far out of the way on the rare occasions  in which Jessica doesn’t make it home in time while Jenny is perfectly able to pick Lily up is insane, I can’t believe this behavior is indulged. I don’t necessarily think that Jenny should be the de facto babysitter all the time but if she doesn’t contribute to the household as an adult, the least she can do if help her sister on the seemingly rare occasion that she needs it. I worked 40 hours between 2 jobs while in college and took 17-18 credits for most semesters so I think her being a minimally decent aunt and sister isn’t too much to ask while she’s in school and not working.

AmItheAsshole,fem846b,t1_fekjeg2,1579243194.0,"Maybe it varies between states but in my area, you can get a ticket for running a yellow light. Specifically, if the light turns yellow and the car is too close to the intersection to stop safely (50ft), you can go through the light. If you have enough time to stop before crossing into the intersection without speeding when the light initially turns yellow, then you can be ticketed. Of course, it’s definitely possible to be farther than 50ft from an intersection, not be speeding while the light turns yellow and make it through. A cop can still ticket you if they want to and then it’s up to the judge. You can also be ticketed in my area for running a red if the light turns red and you’re already in the intersection. I know people who have gotten these tickets, I’ve been in the car with people who have gotten tickets for running reds when the light changed while they were in the intersection. These aren’t super common but it’s more likely to happen in smaller towns. These kind of tickets usually get dismissed if you show up to court and aren’t asshole to the judge."

Your step daughter is financially secure and not in need of this money and honestly, I wouldn’t think it should go to her even if she wasn’t financially secure because she has reveled herself to be a revolting person.

AmItheAsshole,feg4xc5,t3_eovesf,1579077089.0,"INFO: What was Sophie’s original move in date? 

I’m between N T A and E S H. I think it’s valid that you don’t want to live with a baby and don’t want to live with her after you had to learn that second hand. She is an AH for the latter. I think it was smart to decline going into detail about it, telling her the true reasoning would just lead to a social mess in the workplace. 

The exact timing of when you told her and her previous move in date could push you into light AH territory. If she was expecting to move into your place in a couple weeks, then you probably should have contacted her over weekend or after the shower. I know it’s just an office baby shower but now everyone who attended this shower is kind of involved. That might have happened regardless, I don’t have much of a gauge on her personality. I only know that I personally tend to word vomit my anxieties when I’m panicking in the moment but I’m more reserved once I’ve had time to adjust to alarming news. I think it’s reasonable for anyone to panic if they have to find a new living situation with less than a month, especially when pregnant. I don’t think it’s reasonable to not tell a future roommate that you’re pregnant. If she is the type of person to try and involve everyone at the office in her personal moving issues with you, then she’s a manipulative AH and you’re not an AH because the timing wouldn’t have made a difference. 

If she has at least a month (that’s still not much time but not impossible to work with,) then you’re in the clear.

Jalapenos - roast them in the oven and peel them, then puree and freeze for later or make a yogurt, tomatillo, and/or avocado  sauce. Jalapeños are also great for diced freezer logs. Jalapeño mayo, poppers, jalapeño cheddar bread, classic or quick pickles, candied, I like to finely dice them and throw them in anything."

I had a week in November that I was eating 1100 cal/day (I don’t recommend this, I was alternating high cal weeks and lower cal weeks. It was okay for a bit but Thanksgiving sent me into a tailspin.) I was really focusing on eating over 100g of protein/day at the time and it made a huuuuge difference for me. Every time I was reducing my intake in the past, I’d be hungry for days and usually cave. I usually came in under my goal once I started loading up on protein."

She should be apologetic for locking you down there in the first place, it sounds pretty fucked to me that she locked you in the basement and almost made you late for work but is pissed at you for doing what you had to do to get out. I would think offering to help install the new lock would be enough on your part.

I have a pretty ingrained autopilot with little things around the house so I kind of understand how she could close the door and lock it without realizing it. Turning off lights in certain rooms, closing doors, I do it without realizing it even when my boyfriend is still in the room. I would feel like a giant asshole if I locked my boyfriend in the basement for over a half hour by accident, regardless of if it was due to my autopilot habits."

I would say Y T A if she were trying to break a habit of eating unhealthily or was trying to get in shape. I guess it depends on how much she plans to lose but it just doesn’t sit well with me that an adult woman at 5’4” and 120lbs is so focused on the specific goal of losing weight that she’s getting into arguments with her husband over cake.

My older sisters would get pissed if they saw that I had finished something and thrown the packaging away. My mom’s boyfriend moved in when I was 15 to help with expenses and he asked me why I would put a box back in the cabinet when I pulled it out and and it only had one portion left in it. I told him I didn’t want to finish it and he said, “We’ll just buy more.” That literally had never occurred on me before. Up until that point, I thought it was rude to finish a container of food."

People who sell their meds instead of using them are part of the problem. You forgot you had some meds in your own personal medicine cabinet and anyone who tries to blame you is a complete and utter asshole, IRL or on Reddit.

I graduated from college last spring. The whole “it’s in the syllabus” excuse it tired. I was fairly on top of my shit, but even when I was maintaining a 3.92 gpa (ended up graduating with a 3.79) I got fucked by this a couple times and here’s a couple reasons why. 

I was a commuter student that took 17-18 credits per semester for my last 2 years. I was also working 40 hours a week between 2 jobs and driving out of state 2+ times/week to take care of my parent who was dying from stage 4 pancreatic cancer. I had a planner that I would write down all of the syllabus items in for each class because managing up to 10 syllabi per semester between with a different syllabus for each lecture, lab, recitation, whatever, is a beast. If I copied something down on the wrong date or missed something, I would be fucked. I’ve missed handing in assignments or studying for quizzes because of this.  A simple reminder in class would have helped and been pretty easy for the professors but many of them were diametrically opposed to announcing anything that was on their syllabus. Missing a couple things per semester rarely had much impact on my grades but I shouldn’t have been made to feel like an idiot for not memorizing the syllabus for a single lecture block.

There have been multiple instances in which I transferred into a class a week or 2 into the semester in which I didn’t have access to the syllabus until actually arriving to my first day of that class. I’d come into class and waste 15 minutes waiting around when the professor planned to not have class due to their observance of a holiday not recognized by the university or not have any of the correct materials and unable to follow along with the class because of this. They would use “it’s in the syllabus” as an excuse but I’m not a psychic so if you don’t post your shit online or if you used a platform for their materials your students aren’t familiar with, then you’re not really giving your students a chance. My time was so limited then, 15 minutes did make a difference in my schedule.

I had to manage classes on Moodle, Blackboard, Sakai, Ecollege, and those are just the ones I remember. A lot of the time I didn’t have more than 2 classes per semester that used the same platform. I would have sometimes have a class with lab, recitation, and lecture blocks that all used different platforms due to the preference of the different professors leading them. Some of platforms just never sent me email updates no matter what I did in the settings or how many times I took my laptop to the help desk to set up email updates (lookin at you, Ecollege.) Its a pain in the ass to manage.

Some pop quizzes are fine. Not alerting your students to every single upcoming class event is fine. Refusing to remind them of something coming up if you think of it during class because “it’s in the syllabus” is a dick move. Students have busy lives too. You can’t please everyone but but making the occasional announcement in class or sending an email shows your students you actually care and want them to succeed. If don’t care or want them to succeed then...you shouldn’t be teaching."
HaircareScience,fdeqzxg,t3_ekz0wo,1578344793.0,"I’ve been using SM for a year and a half and I like it. I have 2b/c, high porosity, hennaed hair that’s fine and low density.

For spring, summer, and fall, I use the coconut & cactus water lite pick me up masque and the manukau honey & yogurt hydrate + repair protein  treatment. I use them after shampooing once/week for 20 minutes with a shower cap and t shirt wrapped around my hair to trap heat. I need a heat cap but I haven’t found one at my local Harmons and I don’t trust Amazon for most things.

I’m switching back to the bamboo extract & maca root resilient growth protein treatment for the rest of winter because my hair has been a bit drier as it’s gotten colder in my area. It’s a heavier and stretches my waves a bit but I don’t mind. I’ve also used the conditioner from this line and liked it but the pump on the bottle sucks and always breaks. Now I use Giovanni deep moisture conditioner, it’s cheaper and works just as well.

I’ve also used the fruit fusion coconut water weightless hair masque and creme rinse. Both worked great but I prefer the smell of the coconut & cactus water line and they all seem to do the same thing for my hair. 

The only product I didn’t love from Shane Moisture was the raw shae butter reconstructive finishing elixir. A. It stinks. I don’t normally care about product smells, especially if they work but this once smells plastic-y in a way that is kind of nauseating. B. It makes my hair stringy and greasy looking no matter how little I spray on my hair wet, damp, or dry. Now I just use it to spray a little in my hands, rub them together pretty well, scrunch out the gel cast when my hair is dry and fluff my roots. It works fine for that. I’ve done the same when my hair is dry and frizzy but the results have been inconsistent. I’ll probably have it forever since I use so little of it at a time but I wouldn’t recommend buying it if your hair is anything like mine. Any hair oil could accomplish the same thing."
Cooking,fdeffj7,t1_fddy6yr,1578337853.0,I’d like to second this! I had to learn to cook entirely for myself when I went vegan at 15 (I was cooking most of my own meals at that point anyway.) It’s part of the reason that I’m a great cook today. I was only vegan for a year but it’s what got me into the kitchen and I’ve loved cooking ever since.
HaircareScience,fcv6xbn,t3_eiq7ij,1577995905.0,"This guy sounds like he’s drinking the Kool Aid.

SLS can be very drying on porous hair and most hair types that aren’t straight are often porous. It can be a good thing to use every once in a while to remove product and hard water buildup, especially if you use products with silicones. I use a SLS-free chelating shampoo to remove hard water buildup. I think the best thing you can do to grow your hair long is reduce physical stress on your hair from styling and to get to know ingredients. It takes time and some scientific literacy definitely helps but in the end, it’s worth it. Finding the right balance of moisture and protein in products will help to keep your hair manageable while it grows.

I use to obsess about keeping my hair long and wanted to only use “natural products.” I have fine, porous, low density hair that’s a mix of 2a - 2c textures. I used apple cider vinegar and baking soda to wash for almost 10 years, brushed with a boar bristle brush and applied straight jojoba to the ends daily. It was a mess and didn’t grow at all due to the breakage that I had no idea I was causing. Now I use a variety of products based off their ingredients and my hair is the healthiest it’s ever been. It grows at least 1/2” a month which is pretty common. Different things work for everyone so I’m not gonna say that you should or shouldn’t use specific products based off my own experience but learning ingredients will help you avoid wasting time and money.

The only universal hair truth I believe in is don’t buy hair care products from Amazon and Ebay. There’s just too much counterfeit product out there and their quality control is nonexistent."
