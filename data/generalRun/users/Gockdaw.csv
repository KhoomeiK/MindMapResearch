ireland,fej6xzp,t3_ep5q9n,1579159449.0,"Okay, when I put up this post I didn't realise there would be so much I would have to clarify. I thought ""a picture tells a thousand words"", but clearly, for some, I need to spell out those thousand words.

The removal of Minister Murphy's election poster is disturbingly symbolic for a number of reasons. Let's go back to the start though.

What we know is that a man, in the half-collapsed tent that served as his home, was lifted by a crane, like rubbish, and he and his home were presumed to be waste.

The first travesty is that society, you, me, the people walking by who ""get up early in the morning"" going to their jobs and the person operating the crane, have become so used to seeing, I'd estimate, over ten tents along that stretch of the canal that we have become complacent. These tents are the living spaces of humans... real people. The proof of such complacency is that whoever was sent to sanitise the area of the embarrassing signs of homelessness didn't even bother to check in the tent. Even if the tent only contained someone's possessions they should have at least had the decency to check there was nothing which shouldn't just be dumped. These are real people, and the fact that he was actually, in real life, physically overlooked and treated like rubbish is horrifically symbolic of how Fine Gael, the rich man's government, treat the poor and the vulnerable.

Secondly there is the fact that it was Eoghan Murphy, the Minister for Housing's constituency. Now, I do not believe the Minister himself either put the offending poster up or removed it but someone with the power to do so realised that the image of the man with responsibility for housing being photographed over the site of where someone acting on behalf of the state lifted a man and his only form of housing and dumped him with the rubbish would not look good.

It has been mentioned that the man had addiction issues and he had been previously offered somewhere to live. Well, ask WHY he had addiction issues. Happy people in comfortable places are much less likely to become addicts. We should be asking how this man sank so low as to end up living with addiction in a collapsed tent. And how bad must the type of accommodation the government offers homeless people be if they would rather sleep by the canal at night. In how many different ways did the mechanisms of our state have to fail this man for him to end up in a bin? 

So when the politicians and their cronies come to your door electioneering, ask them how we got to a place where real living homeless people have become so invisible that they can literally be gathered up and dumped and ask them what they are going to do to stop this happening again. And don't bother believing for a second that Fianna Fáil will be any different."

A depressing gradual recovery in Fianna Fáil's popularity displaying the Irish electorate's ability to forget and inability to think outside the box."
IWantToLearn,feav2rb,t1_fea74gw,1578952454.0,"Very sound advice.

I would also recommend making a habit of NOT taking your worries to bed with you and preparing for the next day. It may take work but what I do is spend at least an hour winding down. I only allow myself to think of the practical logistics, things like having clothes set out for the next day, having my bag packed with everything I will need and removing any doubts for the morning. I am useless in the morning, so I make sure I will not be wondering where my shoes are in the morning.

Also, if you tend to drink a lot, keep in mind alcohol really fucks with your sleep. You might think you're fine but even one or two beers leaves me paying for it the next day."
