creepyPMs,fgi6wo5,t1_fgi2egp,1580808704.0,I am British and I didn’t find it funny I found it a creepy way to start a conversation. Neither did any of my British friends I sent it to. Maybe if we had conversed even slightly prior to this I could take it as a bit of a joke but out of the blue it wasn’t cute. To me it does seem like a fetish thing. But I guess we will never know.
