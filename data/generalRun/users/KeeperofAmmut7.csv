I'm glad that you were able to talk to the inlaws. And that they may have listened. 

I think that you cutting back on their plunking their arses on your couch for full days at a time is good also. Along with having hubby actually being in the trenches with you.He was there when they were created. He was there when you gave birth and he needs to be there to now that they're here.

That's what these types of people do. If there IS no drama, they will make some up.

>  she feels torn, like she's being asked to ""choose"" a daughter,  

That ISN'T the case. She's already chosen and it's sister. Unless she wants to stir up drama, then YOU are the chosen one only for the reason to tattle to sister. 

Changing your number IS being dramatic, that's called protecting your famiy. 

NC = no contact. No phone calls, texts, emails, carrier pigeons, messenger owls or messenger bunnies. 

> But for my mom, it seems unfair especially because I don't believe she is a hurtful person. 

But SHE IS. She's telling things to your sister when you've asked her not to. In the middle of labour she was telling you to contact your sister.(!)

> Im just tired of every time I see mom, we seem to talk about sister and her wedding....a year later. No other topic seems to matter. 

That's because it doesn't. The wedding is the only thing that matters to sister which means it's the only thing that matters to mum too. In your spoilt brat of a sister's mind, YOU made her look bad because you didn't go to her wedding, which you couldn't afford to do on such short notice, and she couldn't play happy family with her inlaws.

The only thing that will take her mind off the wedding is if, Gods forbid, she gets pregnant. Then that'll be the track her train/brain will be stuck on."
JUSTNOFAMILY,ffi2hxe,t3_es2do6,1579963158.0,"You gotta love that ""sisters should be friends"" shite.  My sister poached my boyfriend and I found out on FUCKING VALENTINE'S DAY when he was 3 hours late for our date cuz he was with her. Later on they were married (what fun for me to hafta even BE there, let alone Maid of Honour) and they were having money troubles so I gave her a job to help out. He made her quit whilst I was pregnant and had NO OTHER help, and I miscarried, and she didn't even give notice. AND she was stealing merchandise from my work when she was there. 

So NO you don't gotta be friends. I talk to my sister maybe once a year.

Your sister has a bug up her arse about the wedding. If she REALLY wanted you there, she would've helped get you there. She's being such a baby over the whole thing. 

You DIDN'T ""steal her wedding thunder"" SHE just wants to be the sun that the whole planet revolves around. 

Your mum not ""oohing and aahing enough"" over the wedding gown is fucking laughable.

It seems to me that the InLaws want to have your babies and by ""gifting you"" a nanny, then they can separate you from the babies easier because they control the nanny. 

* No! No taking the babies across state lines, let alone in a container of toxins is assinine.
* Nope. Sorry. The babies aren't having sleepovers without you for quite a while/if ever. Even if they were 3 seconds and a StarGate away, no overnights.
* They are NOT the parents. They're GrandParents and have no rights to your kids. Babyhogging, calling themselves mama/dada deserves a time out. 

Nope. That IS strange...like she's logging all that so that she can just slip right into the mama role.

The only reason that Al Capone was put in jail was for tax evasion. The IRS doesn't like to get screwed out of money that's owed them.

>my brother and I found out we had received a large sum of money as an inheritance from my mother's uncle. She was left off the will.  

There was a REASON that she was left out of the will...but of course, she's entitled to YOUR inheritance.

>  I know they contacted the estate attorney and executor at least once impersonating me. 

Isn't that illegal? 

>  After that, they came to us and told us that her uncle had put the money in our names so that the IRS could not take it and we could give her the money for her IRS penalty.  

Bullshite!

What absolutely lousy meatbags...notes on how to manipulate youze guys to hand over YOUR money for THEIR IRS penalty.

And of course you don't hear from them now that you told them that you don't wanna talk to them NOT about money.

>they took it upon themselves to try a new approach. They went to my new in-laws, whom they had met once prior, and essentially told them that myself and my SO were horrible human beings for stealing their money.

Hahahahaha. They got shot down.

> They also went to my SO's aunt and uncle and hashed all of their drama to them. The aunt called me in tears and was very distraught, as she thought that my parents had just wanted to have a nice lunch with the new family and was completely blindsided. 

I feel awful for SO's Aunt. What arseholes your parents are!

>  I also sought professional counseling. 

Very good idea.

NO is a complete sentence. When the inlaws start bringing up relative with this, that and the next thing happening that they need money for, change the subject. That is YOUR inheritance. If you wanna toss it into a barrel and set it on fire, that's your choice, no one else's."

Of course, it's not fair. SIL/BIL's kids are getting a spanking for every little thing. And that's groovy for SIL to have grown up like that.

Sounds like more projecting. And setting up a reason for another divorce.
