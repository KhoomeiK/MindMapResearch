Botchedsurgeries,ffe8x8l,t1_fcsbedl,1579839936.0,I know of Wasilla. There's more than one man out there that should get a vasectomy.
Youniqueamua,ff9sebj,t1_ff95623,1579720197.0,Looking like you can afford lip filler could be a status symbol in some places. It isn't cheap and if you can afford to get it done on a regular basis then you must be loaded. Idk though
Youniqueamua,ff8vfu9,t1_ff8tc8w,1579697434.0,"Snitchery did a video a little bit ago about how she over and underlines her lips to give the illusion of lip filler. It looks like this lady followed it, but not very well."

nottheonion,ff10ztx,t3_er37te,1579474166.0,I went to that dentist's practice in 2016 for a wisdom tooth extraction consult! I'm VERY glad I didn't follow through there.
trashy,feovhoo,t1_feout4x,1579306297.0,"I ended up leaving the practice that told me I was grinding my teeth because I had been going to them for literally 11 years and not once along the way did they say ""oh by the way you need a night guard because you grind your teeth "".

That and they kept mixing up my chart with my brother's."
trashy,feoqmwg,t1_feocs2b,1579304074.0,As a fellow grinder I'm saving this. I didn't realize my grinding was so bad until I was flossing and a chunk of tooth came out.

Botchedsurgeries,femtmba,t3_epyq63,1579269251.0,"I think it's hilarious that men always assume when a woman gets plastic surgery that it's for the benefit of the men around her. As if women have no independent desires and self agency to desire something for themselves. 

Women do not exist or live their lives solely for the male gaze or as an add-on to the male experience. We aren't NPCs or background characters."
SaltLakeCity,fefjnn9,t1_fef8ppa,1579057730.0,"We picked SkyHouse primarily because it's so close to both Trax and the Frontrunner (I take public transit to work 75% of the time) but not like RIGHT on top of the stations. Hardware is gorgeous, but the freight trains run right by there, and they do honk their horns."

Botchedsurgeries,fdxjkx0,t1_fduxa9n,1578769352.0,"My hesitation with Solotica is that they're not prescription. I've worked in ophthalmology offices and know far too much about what can happen when a lens is not properly fit, or not well manufactured."
