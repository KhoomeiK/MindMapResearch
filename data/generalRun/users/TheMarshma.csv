Just compliment them without implying other women aren't as good as them. 

I think op didn't mean to imply that, but it is the implication. I don't see why he shouldn't just apologize for implying she wasn't as good as them, and that he only meant to state how amazing she was or something like that."

It's pretty obviously an extremely poor choice of words and she did immediately apologize and is even reaching out to apologize further and explaining that isn't what she meant. If you legitimately don't want to see her again, then you should cut her out. But it seems dramatic for basically what amounts to a bit of unintentional ignorance. Like if she said I'm sorry I said that, but it IS how I feel. I would understand not wanting to ever see her again, but she is saying she's sorry she said that, she didn't mean it that way. etc.

I will say, I don't know how someone wouldn't know to be really careful about how they phrase things with adopted kids, but it also came up as a surprise and she may have just been thinking out loud without really realizing it, it is kind of a big surprise to find out your friends kid was actually adopted imo."

yeah so she didn't make THAT bed. if she was complaining about being a parent in general you could say she made that bed and so now has to lie in it. It doesn't make sense to say that if her partner died unexpectedly.

For example, you could tell anyone who is robbed or assaulted, that they made their bed now sleep in it. Because having things can result in it being stolen violently. It's a possible consequence to owning things.

But i didnt know that it was normal to change the way the events work without changing the name of the event. It just sucks to use saved lvl 50s and then realize you wasted a ton of points because of the cap. And then be told well obviously you need to read the event page every time and look for changes. Its like being fined in the terms and conditions page because you accepted without reading it, hell maybe even worse because at least you have to mark the check box saying you read it.

If they had done a summoning event with a cap would you still be saying well these guys are just mad because they didnt read it? It would still be true, it just feels a little sneaky since they didnt try harder to notify us it was different."
RaidShadowLegends,fc85lwi,t1_fc7yeqp,1577527382.0,"Haha, i had 2 6* ready to rank up. And also about 8 5*. I was gonna collect all the points at once. And had the same reaction as you.


Would be nice if they changed the name of the event if it was gonna work differently, why would i read the rules every time for the same events. Guess i will have to now.

Honestly its an easy event and im gonna end up getting all the rewards. But its still pretty annoying."
RaidShadowLegends,fc83qrg,t3_egobfm,1577526173.0,"I'll be honest, I didn't read the text. I did 2 6 stars, a 5 star, and about 8 4 stars. haha, just kill me."
todayilearned,fc6wnuw,t1_fc6wb8q,1577491412.0,"Okay. I just read it how you wrote it.


>I mean, If you have pedophillic urges, you should probably get therapy dude

But sure may have been looking for it a bit because its a pretty common tactic."
todayilearned,fc6tv2y,t1_fc6pte3,1577489356.0,"Its not that you worded it wrong, just in the flow of the conversation it sounded like you were implying it was mandatory. Because they first said to send all pedos to the gulag and you suggested therapy instead. Youre right they should get therapy, but I would honestly empathize with someone trying to handle it themselves rather than trust someone with such a heavily stigmatized(deservedly) problem."
todayilearned,fc6tdbk,t1_fc6t7p8,1577488992.0,"It was kinda implied, but sure if its by choice no one would object. Obviously.


But its hilarious that you go straight to implying im probably a pedo."
todayilearned,fc6o3ki,t1_fc6mjmy,1577485211.0,"Its not that its not a good thing. Its just that forcing someone who hasnt even done anything wrong yet into therapy might not be a good road to go down.

Its also not uncontrollable if they are controlling it."
reddeadmysteries,fbzm0h1,t1_fbzkrkn,1577251281.0,"I literally said Im the same way. Im just saying some people think its weird to leave something up you regret saying. To them fixing your mistake includes deleting the comment. Which isnt that illogical, especially so if what you said could be insulting or untrue(not this situation). I remember a while back a politician had said some dumb shit and apologized but people were mad he left the tweet up even if he retracted the statement, its just a different perspective on how to handle it."
reddeadmysteries,fbzh2cc,t1_fbzg7qh,1577246444.0,"Guess it just seems weird to say you regret saying something, but also leave it up. I get where you're coming from cause i dont delete either(feels like trying to hide it), but I think the other guys logic makes sense too."
AskReddit,fbzbyqg,t1_fbzbjpw,1577241633.0,Thats why im saying everyone should be in the “middle”. I didnt say atheist claim there is no god. Most will say there probably isnt a god and definitely isnt evidence of one.
AskReddit,fbzb4lm,t1_fbza8w8,1577240833.0,"Everyone should be in the middle anyway. An atheist who claims to know for sure that there is no higher power is logically just as bad as someone who claims there is.

Instead the position should be we can't know, but there isn't evidence that there is a higher power."
AskReddit,fbzaxvj,t3_ef83ho,1577240659.0,"I remember having to research islam in high school, and they had stories similar to jesus making infinite food out of a fish and some crumbs. And I was reading those stories like, do people actually believe this, these are obviously just fairy tales. And like right after I thought that, I was like wait a minute.... it just felt insanely hypocritical, and I had to abandon all the stories I took for granted because people I respected had told me it was all true."
Destiny,fbz7vu9,t1_fbydvv6,1577237838.0,"Saw this the other day, the music comparison was the most convincing argument, and implies it was the plan from the beginning."
AskReddit,fbylj5f,t3_ef2kpy,1577219972.0,"I honestly don't feel anything, but someone finally explained it to me in a way that I could measure. It's how big of a sacrifice you would make for the other persons happiness/well-being. If it's tiny, you probably don't love them that much, if it's large it's a safe bet to say you probably love that person. I don't feel warm or fuzzy when thinking about my gf at all, and so I thought I didn't really LOVE her, especially because of the way it's explained in movies as an overpowering passionate feeling. but I would make huge sacrifices to make sure she's okay/happy."
