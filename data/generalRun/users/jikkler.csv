You know why it stopped when I was 4? I spoke English so well that when my dad asked me a question in French, I'd answer him in English, because I knew *he* was more comfortable speaking his native language than French.

I went to a French-language daycare and an all-French school. Not the immersion program, but actual, 100% immersion. I didn't hear English in the classroom until grade 4, when we started taking English classes. But you know what? In Grade 12, I didn't have a single classmate who spoke better French than English.

Kids can't learn a language in a classroom.

Theres been some successful attempts at Communism in Africa (Sankara's Burki a Faso comes to mind), in central America (Zapatismo), in myriad communes around the world.

Nothing racist about calling me a ""blanco"", but turn it around to another spanish colour for another type of person, and it's a slur. Nothing wrong with recognizing that, that's just how language evolves.

Same goes for chinaman. It's an outdated and innacurate term that got its pejorative sense from the fact that it was used during the construction of the transcontinental railroads in the US and Canada. It was a time when people of Asian descent were seen as inferior. So, the term that was used back then came to be shorthand for that power dynamic. 

Same way the n-word wasn't a slur at its inception, it was just the acceptable term. Its the master/slave power dynamic that existed back then which became baked into the connotative meaning of the word. That's what makes a slur a slur. It isnt just descriptive, its *pre*scriptive. It *assigns* a role of inferiority to the person its used against, by harkening back to a time where that inferiority was u understood to be the truth.

Many slurs came and went before you were even born, but they still existed, and still carry that weight today. Even if you happen to have not encountered them before.
