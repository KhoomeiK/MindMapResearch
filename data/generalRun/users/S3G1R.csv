I'll tell you what. Go into mid level comp (roughly 2,500 to 4,000) slide shottying. More likely than not, you're going to get shut down as soon as you start running down a lane. That's not because it's comp (okay, partially because its comp), but because these people have learned how to deal with shotgun apes, and change loadout according, while avoiding extreme close range encounters. Hell, my loadout is specced to destroy shotgunners, and the only times they kill me are when I don't position myself correctly, forget to look at radar, or pull out my smg too late. If you properly learn how to shut shotguns down, and the mindset of a shotgun ape, you can usually kite them far away from their team, into yours where they will get lit up. And that's why I say defensive shotgunning takes skill. Most of the time you will be absolute, around a corner from a enemy that is chasing for the kill. You can't connect with your team due to various circumstances, so you're forced to hold your ground in the off chance that they'll shoot you in the back. You have no way of knowing when they will round the corner, where they will appear; in the air, sliding, blinking, etc. Or whether they have a teammate right behind them. If they're dumb, yes, it will be a mindless kill, but if they're smart, they will fuck with your mind. And odds are they have a shotgun too, which turns this into a shotgun duel, which is a whole other thing I'm not going to get into. But I know. You already have your mind made up and nothing I say can convince you that ""Shotguns are easy one shot kills that anyone can do with no brain cells."" isn't true. And for the vast majority of players, yes. That is how they use them. But people who know what they're doing, and know the best avenues for getting the one tap, it's a lot more difficult."
DestinyTheGame,fd8ftzf,t3_ekatv6,1578217937.0,"In reality, it's not the range stat that's dropping you. It's the stability stat. The reason the new Gallant Charge fusion is not as good as Erintil or Wizened Rebuke is that it has no stability perks outside of the barrel and Mag, meaning where Gallant Charge only hits one or two bolts, Erintil hits 6. Within damage fall-off, it only takes 4 bolts to down iirc. But at HC range, it takes maybe 5 to kill. And Fusions were meant to bridge the gap between shotguns and snipers, so a High-Impact fusion is operating properly, killing you at that range. Now if you're using a scout at sniper range, and a Wizened Rebuke kills you (which it certainly can), that is proper cause for concern."

destiny2,fd8c08k,t1_fd8b49q,1578216601.0,"That's most likely due to bad positioning on the map, or wiffed shots. If you're having problems with shotguns, why don't you incorporate weapons that discourage shotgun usage? A good SMG can melt a rusher before they get into range (granted you hit your shots).

absolver,fd82jwh,t3_ek58df,1578213178.0,"Stagger is by far the most aggressive style there. All of its base moves are counters, with a Hyper-Armor forward, dodge backward, and spin side steps. Most if not all of these can be gold linked with proper timing. The second place has to be the Faejin style, but it will take some investment to unlock without joining a school. It has a guard break front, parry-counter sides, and low parry back in front stance, and in rear stance it has dodge sides and backstep back that all end in front stance. Khalt is very low tier, but can be devastating with proper reads, and proper timing, as any direction will put you into super-armor, and a consecutive strike after will heal you a mild amount. Forsaken (best class fight me) has left and right parries that stun your opponent long enough to get a chain started, and Windfall is probably the easiest style to use, as the entirety of it revolves around dodge, dip, duck, ~~dive~~, and dodge.
