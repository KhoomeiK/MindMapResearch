Once on top of it protect with fog while another crew member turns off the valve if possible. 

If it cannot be closed, keep cool without extinguishing and let it burn off from distance."
NewToEMS,fee3kye,t3_eooivs,1579025679.0,"I actually went off my ADD meds in order to do my EMT classes and exams. 

I've found that while Adderall is great for making boring things like studying a fun task for an ADD person it also made my retention of the subjects basically nill. 

My suggestion would be to use as many study mediums as possible, I had my exam book on audio files, I had apps like EMT prep, the online book and course work as well as hard copies of books. 

Set aside study and test time every single day and stick to it. Set a timer, you aren't allowed to stop until that timer is done. 


Limit distractions by putting apps like offtime on your phone or turning it off completely. 

If music doesn't distract you I suggest chill hop

It's not easy but getting your EMT is very possible with ADD, I was able to."

My friend had a cat that whenever he had company over would sneak up behind the couch and then smack people in the back of the head and run away. 

He decided to put a bell on the cat so they would have warning. 

After installing the cat bell you would hear nothing and then *smack* *ding ding ding ding* as the cat ran away."
Firefighting,fcssizu,t1_fcsogwp,1577924010.0,"I understand why you disagree with it on a personal level but from a legal standpoint there is no privacy expectation in a public space. 

Now, if one of the firefighters/police/ems were to take a photo of a person's face on a call and post it to social media then yes there would be an issue as they work under HIPPA


Not saying it is right that the public can take pictures of someone else's suffering and share it. 

Regardless, in the context of this photo they did nothing wrong. That isn't anyone's house, no one or any private property was is in danger when they took this photo. 

Does it look terrible from a pr standpoint out of context? Absolutely. Should they be punished for it? I don't think so."
