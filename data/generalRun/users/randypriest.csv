As soon as your computer/device is compromised, they'll have your unhashed passwords. You also have the potential of accidentally sharing the file among all sorts of other attack vectors with that file.

The reason it's saying it is connected is likely due to the way it checks. Some devices only require a ping (i.e. ""Are you there?"" to a particular web address) whereas the portal requires a HTTP connection to port 80. It's the same reason some hotel networks still let you access Facebook without logging into the network, as the app uses port 443."
