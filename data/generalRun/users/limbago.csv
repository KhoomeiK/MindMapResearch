The neighbour is the fuckwad, not OP

You want to play stupid games like that, you’ve played yourself"
MaliciousCompliance,ffbzhgk,t1_ffbx8jw,1579787595.0,"Ok, so ensuring an establish rule was being COMPLIED with, isn’t compliance - gotcha

UKPersonalFinance,ffbwgr7,t1_ffbu5f6,1579785040.0,"I don’t mind carrying a slightly under / over balance, what got me was how quickly they’ve acted (unnecessarily) to try and increase my DD, whereas before for 18 months overpaying wasn’t an issue

I know overall I will end up back in the black, and in a way see the credit refund as a mini cash boost out of the blue, just the way they’ve acted strikes me as a tad cynical I guess (and wanted to see if anyone else agreed)

Edit: just re read my previous comment and it reads nothing like I originally intended. I’m miffed at how they’ve acted, not that it’s impossible to end at 0. Sorry!"

Way to overreact"
MaliciousCompliance,ffbuw0a,t1_ffbpwvz,1579783570.0,"So intentionally reporting someone for breaking a rule in full knowledge of the likely outcome, isn’t maliciously complying to the nature of complaining when the silence rule is broken?

UKPersonalFinance,ffbu30b,t1_ffbhcks,1579782766.0,"Oh I don’t think it’s anything to do with conspiracy theories like you mentioned, I’m just miffed that, as you said, it’s impossible to end at a 0 position, and historical data clearly shows increasing the amount isn’t necessary"
UKPersonalFinance,ffa9qnc,t1_ff9z53r,1579730642.0,!Thanks. I’ll wait and see if they try and change it again in the next month or two I guess
UKPersonalFinance,ff9wwsu,t1_ff9wp7u,1579723282.0,"To be honest I have no idea, I haven’t asked or looked in to it

I’m perfectly happy paying monthly, all budgeted for etc, I was just amazed how quickly they acted to try and raise my bill, unfairly and disproportionately in my opinion 

At least they’ve agreed to wait for a few months and see if my usage drops (Jan is £71 so pretty much bang on, last month was the most expensive month usage wise we’ve actually had since we started using UP)"

MadeMeSmile,ff9lpb6,t1_ff9g2tg,1579715630.0,"If that’s what you want to assume, then that’s fine, I genuinely don’t know the commenter so can’t say for certain 

This whole thread has devolved in to god/atheist bashing, which is ridiculous, but it’s the internet so I guess it’s par for the course 

Given that this is at the forefront of everyone’s mind because of this, it’s easy to assume (both ways) that either a love/lack of live for god is the underlying motivation for every comment

It could literally have been as simple as someone just saying “take the credit for this awesome thing you’ve done”, no other underlying points to be made"
MadeMeSmile,ff9lcin,t1_ff9br15,1579715422.0,"That’s A) a gross over simplification, and B) obviously not true 

I’m not taking either side here, but when there’s a debate happening it’s always best when the arguments are serious, and called out for BS when they are (which, to be fair, is most of this thread in a nutshell)"
MadeMeSmile,ff98xvs,t1_ff98g4n,1579707573.0,"I agree, the comments are largely a train wreck

MadeMeSmile,ff98cgz,t1_ff97b22,1579707191.0,"It’s a fair point, but you’ve intentionally chosen a loaded example to prove your point 

Eg who’s doing more good in this world? An atheist that volunteers at his local soup kitchen every week, or a pedophile priest systematically grooming and raping children in his congregation?

This isn’t supposed to be pro or anti-religion, just highlight how you’ve not been 100% genuine in putting your point across"

UKPersonalFinance,ff68itm,t1_ff5gpqt,1579621644.0,"To piggy back on this, sometimes it is the company that is the blocker instead of the manager (although not in this case)

I have an employee leaving because they were (justifiably) feeling undervalued RE salary. I was pushing to get them a raise to bring them just over average for the industry (still relatively new, so is a fair ask), however our HR director keeps veto-ing the request as it exceeds her BS ""5% cap"" (5% would be c. 1.5k, I was asking for 4-5k).

So now instead of retaining one of our strongest team members and her knowledge, we pay a recruitment company £1500 plus someone the same salary I was trying to secure previously 

YAY LOGIC"
