To rebut your comments:

On Tuesday it was announced by the clerk. Yesterday. So a change that was well received. Not lied to you about, but a recent change. 

Supenaing witnesses: the Democrats have **no** reason to think the Republicans won't let them bring witnesses? Maybe that's why they made such a big deal of it? Because McConnell has been *very* open about not allowing witnesses and holding a shame trial. So again, not a lie, you're just not viewing the whole truth from over the past month. 

Ken Starr went to court to have it ruled that the president has to comply with Supenas. The court ruled that the president has to comply so he did. Now here we are, 20 years later, and our current president is ignoring the court's ruling. Who's breaking the law?

So tell me. Who's lying? The media you're listening to? The Democrats? The totally honest and forthright republicans? 

Again, I appreciate your post, you did your research, but you're incorrect by ignoring the reality and history around your comments.

Prices are crazy high, but buyers still bang down downs because their monthly number ""isn't that bad"". 

When rates pull up again because the FED has no choice, or lending stanrds tighten, it's going to be a sad day in an already inflated market. 

But listen to others, who claim we have another 10 years of boom to go. They have decent arguments too. There's a *ton* of money out there and it needs to go somewhere. Real estate is a nice place to park money. 

All that'll happen is the everyday-guy that hasn't bought yet will be squeezed out in the next pinch by overqaulified buyers. Home ownership will continue to drop in exchange to keep the ride going for a few more years. Sad."
