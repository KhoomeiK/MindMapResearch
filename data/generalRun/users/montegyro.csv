trippinthroughtime,ffibrf1,t1_ffi6d8u,1579970098.0,"Am married. Had sex. Found that kinks were not my thing and been ok with ""boring"". It's really down to the person. Some people seek wilder and wilder things as they go. Some people skip some steps and go right for the freaky freaky shit. But that doesnt guarantee it's better sex over others. It's just more tailored to your needs."

AskReddit,ffa3rhh,t1_ff906sa,1579727300.0,"If I did this to my 13 y/o self, it wouldn't be good. At the time I just moved, with no friends. Socially awkward, emotionally abused, and caught up with the wrong crowd. Only reason I wasnt fucked up from drugs is cause I was always broke."
todayilearned,feapk7a,t1_fea4ru7,1578951092.0,"There is a guy that did this. Put a mod in so he could give a softer double-toot. I'm pretty sure it was on YouTube, but damn if I dont have a link because it was some years ago."
Whatcouldgowrong,fe9i2d3,t1_fe8qg7c,1578937717.0,"For real, in my short 3 months there I had no problems walking out to the main street for some taco bell or jimmy John's. Those walks were my study breaks."
YouShouldKnow,fdqkik6,t1_fdqildt,1578668876.0,"Honestly, that slipped my mind. I would say shit out of luck because of jerks. Maybe they had a brain lapse too."
YouShouldKnow,fdqc67a,t3_emlplf,1578662678.0,"I suppose at times I wish my relationships with coworkers and strangers was improved by my natural impression. But at the same time, I've learned to enjoy the peace of limited social obligations.

Being self aware is why I can identify others that are just internally screaming and need to know I'm not judging them. 

It's a shame I'm not the greatest at expressing it."

ffxiv,fcyhgib,t1_fcxohf6,1578080213.0,"To chat, I guess? Or a means to deflate the arguments about NN. It can remain mostly pointless, just like having fellowships, but it's always an option."
ffxiv,fcxmmur,t1_fcxjybg,1578066577.0,"I suppose what's really needed is a mentor only channel. They get their general chat like they wanted, and the novice network remains as is."

raisedbynarcissists,fc5z4g3,t3_egaph7,1577468838.0,"From a young age I was referred to as very quiet, or very stoic. I got to a point that nothing could get a rise out of me. If I got badly hurt, I laughed to stop crying. My nickname among friends was ""Jew"". Bullies would stop bothering with me, because I was better at insulting myself, (except for one and I think he was just secretly homo for me or something). If I expressed humor, it was always mirroring my audiences taste. If I broke down, I made sure it never happened in front of anyone, but my mom. 

My secret? Never letting my dad get to me, and never letting his wife get to me. For 12 years.

I had to work out a lot of terrible social ticks going through several relationships. I'm still the grounding rock in my marraige, tho. So I learned some incredible strengths."
politics,fc4d2nu,t1_fc3dsw4,1577413164.0,"I vote as well, even at the local level. My candidates of choice lost by a large margins. I'm not fooling anyone by saying I'm doing my part. It's up to the rest to do theirs."
povertyfinance,fc3ot18,t1_fc2yppr,1577394885.0,"I could definitely level with that. I lived in an area where it sucked taking a bus anywhere because the system was terrible. So when I had a car and that broke down I pulled a lot of shenanigans to try and have another car lined up to replace that one. I've gone as far as finding a good deal on a car with a manual transmission and begged someone teach me how to drive it. It's a Saab, and I'm lucky enough to know a guy who's like a savant with fixing cars. So I just ordered parts and pay him in cash for his time. That saved me a ton of money. It seems having connections and knowing certain people also go hand-in-hand with having the funds to afford decent quality."
