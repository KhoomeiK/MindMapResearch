Marriage,ffc54ag,t1_ffc40yw,1579791742.0,"This is why Gottman changed his direction on couples communication and believes that base compatibility must exist. There are topics (sex) that become considerably worse when they are discussed... most of the time. We simply cannot change some of who we are without radical work, and perhaps there are things we shouldn’t be changing... just because someone else wants you to be different."
Marriage,ffc4xpa,t1_ffbwyex,1579791620.0,"Compromise means a range of loss options from one person “winning” and one “losing” to both people “losing”. For instance, my wife desires that the countertops be 100% bare as often as possible and that dishes never sit out. I could care less about that and would do dishes once a day, were that possible. So, we compromise and I “lose” by agreeing that we will set the “clean countertop” standard in the home. I do the dishes while I cook and after the meal... every time. So, I “lost”, right? Well, my wife is happier, the house is cleaner, and all I had to “lose” was moving the time it takes to right after the meal. So yes, I “lost”, but not really a lot... right?

Many things in life are yes or no, left or right; on these things we cannot collaborate OR compromise, we must simply choose. If you choose together you can call that collaboration, but nothing was co-created... nothing was decided beyond what the options on the table were. We talked mostly about our feelings on the choice at hand and picked one. I don’t often need to work through that with my partner, I do it only when she needs it. I can just pick, and in most cases, pick “her way” because most things simply don’t matter. I don’t carry resentment as a result, I forbear the consequences or my desires because they weren’t very crucial (to me)."

Start with pervasive ones, core sins... start with Pride. Let’s focus on that and maybe everyone will shut up a little and start accepting all sinners into the fold.

Christ’s prayer in John 17 realized... but no. Too many Christians took a loving and accepting Master and turned His words into divisiveness and judgment.
