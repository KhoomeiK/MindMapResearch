teslore,ff5c3tg,t1_ff438ci,1579586841.0,You mean the Dwemer?
DestinyTheGame,ff5203q,t1_ff4qk1w,1579578069.0,"The problem with Gambit is that unless you have a team with dedicated roles going in, you're gonna have a bad time. Gambit is not good with randos. I can play it all day with my clan mates because we all go in with a plan. I can't do that with MM because then I'll be playing with people who are more worried about getting bounties than winning."
DestinyTheGame,ff51dz1,t1_ff4vhlw,1579577608.0,She did the procedure willingly right before the collapse. There is some lore on it on Mars.

Posting about it on social media isn't a vehicle to feeling better, its about making it about you so people can tell you how special and strong you are."
airbrush,fej87fv,t1_fej85iq,1579161066.0,"If the size and threading is the same, yes. I've done it before. Just have to make sure it seats properly or you'll have paint seeping through when you spray."

airbrush,feixasw,t3_ep8699,1579149773.0,"What model is the airbrush? If the tip is removable, then you can order another for little cost. Local hobby store may have it in stock as well. If you don't have one, make sure you get a holder to set your brush down on when not in use or when you need a break. This will keep it from falling off of whatever surface you have it on and keep this from happening."
airbrush,feix6iv,t1_fehtehp,1579149674.0,"There are plenty of basic rules in airbrushing. The rules go out the window when it comes to creativity, not prep and maintenance. This is misinformation."

airbrush,fdtbhb0,t1_fds6q2d,1578714412.0,"You can get a bigger air filter to screw onto them and it makes a huge difference. Those small air filters are what kills them. Once you screw a new one on and let that baby rip, its like a new compressor, and it'll fill the tank faster, so the engine isn't laboring as hard."
airbrush,fdtawzk,t1_fdrgr03,1578714205.0,"I am going to go against the grain here and tell you to buy it, and here is why: For what you are doing it is perfect. It will be noisy, but it will not be terrible. I own one of these and a larger one from Harbor Freight. Just keep oil in them and get good moisture/oil traps and you will be fine. People want to shit on Harbor Freight, but some of their stuff is good. You won't be spraying Civics any time soon, but for models they work fantastic. I've had mine for 3+ years and they are still strong with constant use. Just make sure the airbrush isn't from HF. Those are total ass."

space,fdpjd7w,t1_fdo7oqw,1578630210.0,I wonder if dark matter is really just gravitational force from supermassive black holes? Could there be black holes out there so large that they can cause a galaxy to spin extremely fast AND hold it together? I've never really seen anything explained on this.

Tinder,fcog6n6,t1_fco7e6c,1577831451.0,That actually isn't true. It is possible to get a woman preggers while the red river flows.
DinoCrisis,fcmq17q,t1_fclr1j5,1577786549.0,"Dude, no. No it doesn't. It looks good for fanmade, but it isn't near the polish of a paid title."
netflix,fcmhixj,t1_fcm7rgp,1577775496.0,The source material for this was released in 1993. I doubt very much that they are trying to copy GoT. Its not even a close comparison. They are two totally different worlds with not much in common other than royalty and a lot of death.
netflix,fcmhayg,t1_fcm4n5k,1577775248.0,"I mean, if by ""screwed"" you mean ""rolling around in piles of money that doesn't show any sign of shrinking"", then yeah, they're royally fucked."
netflix,fcmh8cf,t1_fcm9kt3,1577775169.0,The game series is actually based off of a series of books. You don't have to be a fan to find it entertaining if you already like fantasy settings.

They look like Dollar Store knock offs. Its an objective observation. Report me if you want. I haven't said anything to you personally that is or can be construed as offensive. You have yourself a nice day."

powerrangers,fcm6diy,t1_fcm4w0y,1577765401.0,It isn't rude to point out terrible craftsmanship? I do commissions myself for models and I would feel like absolute shit letting someone buy this from me looking the way it does. It is put together poorly.

apexlegends,fclyvkh,t1_fclitxb,1577759859.0,"The game is a lot easier on PS4 it seems like. I have it on PC, XB1 and PS4, and PS4 it is way easier to grab kills compared to the other consoles. It 100% has to do with the PS controller and the way the thumbsticks are set up on it. Unless you have extenders, you're gonna have a bad time with most FPS games compared to other platforms."

nfl,fbihg4u,t1_fbihcgq,1576901104.0,Oh I'm not saying they weren't. I loved McNabb and that era of the Eagles. They were electrifying to watch most of the time. It was just obvious that he couldn't make himself take that last step.
