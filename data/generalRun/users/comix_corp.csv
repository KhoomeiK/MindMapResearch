> Times of uncertainty lead to greater ingroup cohesion. The economic economic depression, climate change, etc. has perhaps catalyzed this sort of middle class white male identity, and all this could just be its outward expression in capitalist society

I think this is part of it, but it's not the whole picture. A lot of the alt-right fanboy types are middle-upper class and facing no serious instability in their lives, aside from maybe in personal relationships. They're certainly not all working in a factory or something. Anecdotally, of the people I know from high school that turned right-wing, most were the children of businessmen or doctors. One is the son of a cop. One is working a cushy job at his dad's firm despite being incompetent at any task. There's no economic malaise there.

I think a lot of it is due to an altogether efficient right wing propaganda system that is hard for the left to combat. Right wingers have adapted to the internet fairly well at this point. In my case it's slightly different because the right wingers I know have gone down the Catholic traditionalist route, so it's picking up on existing parts of their own beliefs, but it's still very internet driven: they all share these dumb memes on FB and watch the usual YouTube freaks."

In general the emphasis is to reduce the instances where people have power over someone else; groups can make decisions by majority-rules but dissenters are not bound or coerced into following.

Anarchist decision making processes don't require everyone to agree. That is not practical and as far as I know nobody wants to mandate that for all situations. There may be situations where it's necessary to expel someone; there's no hard and fast rule in place but it's not against anarchism to do it -- at least if you consider anarchism to be the practical philosophy that it is.

""No private property"" isn't a rule, it's the absence of a rule. For it to work, it requires the construction of social bonds of mutual respect with other people.

Lonely are the Brave is based on the novel *The Brave Cowboy* by the anarchist Edward Abbey. Screenplay by Dalton Trumbo, who was famously blacklisted from Hollywood for being a communist.


It's about a last-of-the-cowboys character, played by Douglas, who hates the way the modern world is getting less and less free. He's an itinerant ranch hand who doesn't even have a fixed address: he sleeps where he can, when he feels like it. When asked by a cop for his ID, he says: ""I don't need a card to figure out who I am, I already know."" (which is a quote from another anarchist novel, *The Death Ship* by B. Traven).

I don't want to give it all away because the way it unravels is very interesting but in a nutshell he goes to town to visit a friend who has been imprisoned for aiding some illegal immigrants. He isn't allowed to visit him so he deliberately gets himself arrested just to get in there and see him.

The exact details of how this would work vary among the different anarchist tendencies, but I'm a syndicalist so I'll give that (rough) answer: people in a community realise there is a block of vacant land that could be used to build a few houses. They contact a local construction firm, who are part of the construction workers' syndicate. As well as consulting with the local community, they consult with architects, designers, engineers, etc and draw up a plan for the houses. Then they just start building, using resources obtained through distribution centres run by logistics workers; the resources themselves are sourced from brickmakers, toolmakers, etc.

Anarchism (or, at least, syndicalism) does not exclude the possibility of committees forming to manage such tasks. The difference between these committees and government is that the committees are organised in a federalist manner: bottom-up, not top-down; the delegates are recallable and not appointed by executive committee, but selected by the constituent bodies. 

I usually dislike answering these sorts of questions, so this might be rough...

A committee could be formed compromising delegates from building industry unions, local union halls/bourses du travail/ateneos/whatever, as well as relevant professionals like city planners, engineers, etc. In a period of negotiation, a broad master plan for the city can be drawn up, or perhaps the city can be divided into smaller units to be worked out on a smaller scale, whatever. Delegates go back to their groups with the plan and listen to feedback, and then go back to the negotiating table and work to incorporate these concerns. Then the process continues until there's something everyone roughly agrees on; the groups ratify it, the delegates go back and specific tasks can start to be organised.

From there, the building industry unions can put a notice on their website listing the available projects that need to be completed, and they can start bringing together workers or groups of workers to build roads, train lines, etc. Whilst also communicating with other relevant unions to ensure a supply of bricks, mortar, construction equipment, you get the gist."

It's not too long, 17 pages, and I can send you the .pdf if you like. It sums up the anarchist approach pretty well and also shows you what it looks like in practice -- after all, anarchist education is not just for some far-off society but is actually being implemented right now, partially as a method of getting to that far-off society.

Anarchists have always put a premium on education, and have been involved in progressive education experiments since it really began as a distinctive tendency. Anarchist education looks kind of similar to the more mainstream progressive school models: Montessori, Waldorf, etc. Children are empowered and are seen as not merely receptacles for dry facts but active agents in the learning process. Assessments, exams, etc are usually discarded as much as possible, and the children are given as much agency as possible in determining the course of their own learning.

Regular education sucks because it is not intended to actually help the child grow and learn but to churn out obedient citizens. In many progressive schools, children decide on the class rules themselves -- I remember listening to a radio broadcast about one progressive school in my country, where children held a vote because they wanted to bring sweets to school as part of lunch. The motion passed, and the kids started eating sweets at lunch. But they found that they couldn't concentrate on any of their subjects after lunch, they were too jittery and inattentive, so a week later they held another vote to ban sweets and it passed.

And the ""live and let live"" approach only works up to a point and is unable to deal with more complex issues -- eg, if proper healthcare (incl. vaccines, medicines) is being withheld from children in a primitivist group, and the infant mortality rate is as a result quite high, the rest of society should intervene in some way."

Maybe armament strategies have some relevance to Marxists and others whose aim is to capture power, but I'm a socialist that thinks one of the prime tasks in a revolution is to prevent the formation of a ""leftist government"", or to ensure its dissolution as quickly as possible.

Also. The working class in Britain is not any more oppressed than the working class in America. If anything, Britons are less oppressed.

stupidpol,fg5c64o,t1_fg57iku,1580523619.0,"I agree with your first two paragraphs. I mean I'm a syndicalist so I obviously have my preferences but even the people who split off to form the Communist Party would shudder to think that their actions are being used to justify a strategy of recruiting basically only students.

On your last paragraph, I'm not confident about the potential of left populism to rejuvenate things. Sanders might have a flow-on over here but there's nobody on the Australian left at least that could run a similar campaign or attract anywhere near the same kind of support.

Personally I think there just needs to be some strategy shifts, at least on the part of the random Trot sects and stuff. Populist surge or no, leftists just need to get a lot better at working with the working class, and just *being* working class, period. There's no reason they couldn't encourage their members to get jobs in particular industries; I know in the 70s, the people that are now Solidarity/SAlt targeted the meat industry and built up a  reasonable amount of influence in there. 

They eventually abandoned it for various reasons, incl. deindustrialisation and a frustration that they weren't recruiting enough, but I've spoken to some of the old timers and they don't really regret the experience. Even if they don't really get anywhere with it, it'll at least teach them how to be practical with their politics, and probably develop some much needed modesty as well.

A whole conspiracy about this was developed later by Christian weirdos who thought the Holocaust was some kind of gay conspiracy.

Reading through accounts of far-right scenes, one thing that's notable is how divorced most of them are from reality. Not just in terms of their freak beliefs but in terms of lifestyle too -- like a lot of them are just total social misfits that live in their own head, play dress-up with Nazi uniforms in their mothers basement, that sort of thing. It's totally plausible that these people could develop a far-fetched idea in their head of some sort of potential pro-gay Nazi reich, especially when it blurs with sexual fetishism, as it seems to here:
