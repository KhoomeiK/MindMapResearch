news,fefcol1,t3_eorjbl,1579053452.0,"People don't have the necessary social support they need. Coupled with the decline in Christianity, which asserts your basic value as a human being (and discourages suicide), the suicide rate has soared. Yes there are problems with churches but there are plenty of liberal ones out there - they will provide you with a solid social system as well."
PrayerRequests,febsexe,t3_eocbda,1578962179.0,You are strong and mighty. Circumstances arrange themselves for your good now. God is with you!
AskReddit,fdm27z8,t1_fdm23oi,1578538062.0,"I never heard either of those things from her. But hey, do what you want. I'm not evangelizing for her."
AskReddit,fdlxgon,t1_fdjapw4,1578534827.0,"No, not always. If you can look beyond the harsh exterior and listen to the message without letting your own ego and prejudices get in the way it is easier to judge the truth of the matter."
Pets,fdjbc6r,t3_elogue,1578464101.0,Cats choose whether or not they are going to cuddle with you. Also some just flat don't like to cuddle. From your comments I would recommend a dog. Puppies are cute but also a giant pain in the ass plus your schedule isn't ideal for them. An adult dog would probably be best.
AskReddit,fdja3i4,t1_fdj8mff,1578462905.0,She's really harsh-sounding but I grew to like her after a while. She sure doesn't sugar-coat anything.
suggestmeabook,fdiucig,t1_fdik0if,1578451226.0,Endurance is the most fantastic book! It has so much excitement! I'll check out the Roberts' book.
AskReddit,fditnmj,t3_eled64,1578450784.0,It's a tie between the people who think God is stupid to those who say that religion is the source of all the ills throughout history.
AskReddit,fdcglll,t1_fdbtfp0,1578274392.0,"I think memorization has its place. Some things just have to be memorized, like your multiplication tables, words in foreign languages, and names and dates in history class."
AskReddit,fdcggj1,t1_fdc7x8w,1578274294.0,"We all come to a point in our lives when we realize our parents are just people, not all-knowing gods like they are when we're children."

suggestmeabook,fd0jwu0,t3_ehnxkp,1578119880.0,"Any genre and any author, eh? I fit that category. :-) I have some you may enjoy:

[The King's Champion](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076GC58QL/) (YA fantasy)

[Lady Law and the Texas DeRangers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X9JSTPR) (western/romance/adventure)

I've got a couple shorter pieces up there as well if you like humorous romances."
Pets,fczvqmc,t3_ejoy0y,1578109431.0,"Interesting info about static electricity. I always just figured they were oversensitive to stimulation. That's why I'm always careful to respect my cat's boundaries when I pet her. I read some study where it said that they don't necessarily like it, but they tolerate it."
PrayerRequests,fcztz24,t3_ejlcna,1578108574.0,God is with you. Breathe and know that. The right and perfect answer for your difficulties is making its way to you at this very moment. Hold on until it comes.
science,fcwje83,t1_fcu80jw,1578027224.0,"Except everyone on Reddit complains about their $200K student loan debt, so higher education is less popular than it once was."
ifyoulikeblank,fcw4y4s,t3_eizmhi,1578017250.0,The original Twilight Zone - IMHO it's better than Black Mirror.

Pets,fcw3dko,t3_ej73h2,1578016210.0,"I would leave them alone. They'll likely come out eventually. For food, I would think. If it takes too long you could try to open a tuna can and lure them with that."
SDCC,fcw2jq7,t3_ej5v30,1578015660.0,The best thing to do is to find a bunch of roommates and stay in the Gaslamp.
suggestmeabook,fcso210,t1_fcreutq,1577920807.0,I agree. A good friend loves it to pieces but it just didn't do much for me. I didn't finish it.
suggestmeabook,fcsmkgv,t1_fcrc56a,1577919755.0,"Read real history of the Middle Ages. That's where GRRM got much of his Game of Thrones material from. Incest, patricide, matricide, anything-a-cide, eyes gouged out, manhood chopped off. Yeah, it's got it all."

booksuggestions,fcklliw,t3_ehlund,1577727990.0,"As someone who has jumped into new careers more than once, most recently at age 40, be sure to save as much as you can before you make the jump. It always takes some time to get up to speed. It's worth it, though. Life is short."
Advice,fccqu2m,t3_eh2dwt,1577601552.0,Go to Overeaters Anonymous. They're awesome and you will get amazing help.
Pets,fcceoop,t3_egrxn5,1577597533.0,How about guinea pigs? A lot of people aren't allergic to them. They do eat hay though and some people are allergic to that.
dogswithjobs,fc6irvy,t1_fc601n8,1577481567.0,Look further down the comment thread - that's discussed.
Futurology,fc40zl2,t1_fc3xc9d,1577403776.0,"Not only this but historically the life of serfs was,as a great historian said, ""Nasty, brutish, and short."""
Futurology,fc40c65,t1_fc3yo8f,1577403286.0,Me too. Down with the big banks!
dogswithjobs,fc3z1vm,t1_fc3wllz,1577402324.0,"Yes, I realize that some things have been done throughout the years that are incorrect, such as medical practices. 

Something like maneuvering through frozen wastelands on dogsleds is quite practical, however. Like the guy says in another comment, the fan hitch is thought to be safer in certain conditions. 

Not so sure that the line hitch is necessarily better but it is likely easier on roads and narrow pathways."
dogswithjobs,fc3u49a,t1_fc3tz1h,1577398676.0,"We're not talking about carbon fiber sleds, are we? 

And yeah, I think after living the way they did for literally thousands of years they have figured out how to work dogsleds better than random know-it-all redditors."
dogswithjobs,fc3t5un,t1_fc3o9ph,1577397982.0,"Um, no. The Inuit did it both ways. I think they might know a little more about dogsledding than you."
AskReddit,fc3mqjl,t3_efqzp6,1577393404.0,"Stayed home for the first Christmas in ages because I just saw the fam over Thanksgiving. First weekend in December I found out that my younger brother has aggressive, inoperable cancer. He's already in hospice."
Pets,fc3m3z3,t1_fc3ly0i,1577392955.0,"I typed wrong - it was actually a month,I think. Much better than the $2k I was being quoted for surgery.

Another thing you might try is to call around at different vets offices about what  they charge. There can be a tremendous difference between different offices in the same area."
dogswithjobs,fc3ll8d,t1_fc3iugo,1577392585.0,Because there are two ways to run a dogsled. One is with the dogs all in a line like we're accustomed to seeing and another is to run them like fingers stretched out. This looks like the latter.
Shoestring,fc3kwei,t3_efufh4,1577392101.0,"We stayed at Rose in Rome (AirBNB) next to the Vatican at a very reasonable price. It was clean, quiet, and safe."
Pets,fc3k3w8,t3_efzm63,1577391546.0,"In my current financial situation I would not be able to do that.

My cat had something similar a few years back. The vet said we could either do surgery or try a special diet for a week that might dissolve the stones. I chose the latter option and thankfully it worked."
Frugal,fc3jrrj,t1_fc3ek3x,1577391338.0,Okay great - thanks so much!
Frugal,fc25egf,t1_fb8uare,1577341185.0,Do you have a curriculum? Just wondering how it works.
