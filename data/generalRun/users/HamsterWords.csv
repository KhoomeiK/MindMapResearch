We get you, probably because we've been there. Many people haven't and don't know how to deal with a depressed person.

""It gets better"", though, is qualitatively different than ""Stop thinking about it"", ""get over it"", which are of course the worst things you can say to a depressed person, as you're minimising or even invalidating their feelings.

""It gets better"", is different. Especially when it comes from a person with experience with depression. There are other threads about this. But it does get better (even if not great), and bad again, and better again and so on. That's life with depression.

When in a low, it sounds crazy that it will ever get better. But shit happens: you change jobs, you meet a potential friend, you get mildly interested in I don't know, electronics, and this distracts you from the shitty things that are making you feel terrible. That's when the fight begins, to stay *okay* and delay the next low."

I don't know. When you're depressed you *don't* believe you deserve anything.

In order to overcome the low you have to do things *despite* not wanting to do them. And notice that I said ""overcome the low"", not overcome depression. Depression is the fight against the many lows that will try to come back again and again."

>Focus on yourself as a person and how you relate to others.

Just look around this reddit: Many of us are in good relationships and still depressed. Depression is not the same as being sad and lonely: It often includes these feelings, but it won't be *solved* when you get a partner.

During a low, nothing gives you energy and everything seems to cost more energy that you have. When not in a low, stuff is not *as bad*, and some things are *kinda fun* like chatting to a friend/coworker about whatever you might have in common (even if superficially), like school, or work, or video games, or sports."

So what do you do? Of course it's easier said than done, but *when it does get better,* and you get that tiny bit of energy you thought you'd never get, you have to work hard to keep it better, and in some sense ""delay"" the next low as much as possible (maybe months or years).

How? Do the things that bring you energy. Hanging out with certain people, making things, exercising, going out, whatever works for you. But yea, depression is f-ing hard work and that's our curse.

depression,fex9g55,t3_eqm9ao,1579427243.0,"Totally agree with u/The_Pundertaker. 

OP,  I'm sorry you feel that way, and we're here to help.

First, I'm going to challenge your comments: ""I'm a fucking disaster."" You're not. That doesn't even mean anything. When those intrusive, non-productive thoughts/feelings pop up you need to narrow them down until they mean something. Same with ""I ruin everything I touch"". That just can't be literally true. A more accurate statement might be: ""I have made mistakes in the past"". That doesn't reflect on you as a person. 

Second, It seems like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself ""to be good at something"". And hey, I do that too, but it's unproductive and just leaves you feeling bad about yourself. Doing stuff is about enjoying it, regardless of the quality of the outcome. People who are ""good"" at stuff got good at it by doing it a lot (really *a lot*), and they did that because they enjoyed doing it. ""Talent"" is overrated and better ignored. Maybe art or music is not the thing you enjoy. I'd suggest trying something where you have no expectation on the outcome, so that you can just do it for the sake of it, without pressure that you have to perform a certain way. (For example: For me it was climbing (bouldering). Having done no sports at all before that, I found myself at 28yo fighting against a climbing problem. Of course I was going to suck at it, and I did, but I found it very enjoyable and helped a lot with my mental health. And yea, you get better with time and it's motivating to see progress and to become stronger, but being ""good"", especially compared to others, doesn't really matter.)"
