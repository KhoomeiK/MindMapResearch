assholedesign,ffb7hy8,t1_ffa5zq2,1579753955.0,"I actually used hello fresh for awhile back a couple years ago for this exact reason. It really helped me be able to recognize what serving sizes look like. Also helped me get used to regularly cooking more than just things that come in frozen boxes and preshaped breaded patties.

Looks like I quit just in time, though. All I had to do was find which odd corner of the website they hid the ""unsubscribe"" button in. That was annoying enough at the time, but this is some Comcast shit right here."
