witcher,fewbliu,t3_eq2zow,1579408005.0,I think the way it was glistening was very pretty
witcher,fewb6wp,t3_eq9fsz,1579407844.0,"Agreed. Triss acts an anime girl and she's opportunistic and disloyal. Geralt is not a weakling that needs to be babied, and his dry sense of humor playing off Yennefers sharp wit is god tier, the sparks are flying. Their sex life must be incredible"
witcher,few8k0g,t1_fepnqpq,1579406910.0,Geralt forgave her why can't you? He has not been an angel towards her either acted like a damn fool but somehow it's only her who gets called out. Their relationship is complicated they're not high school kids.

How very selfish and entitled to litter one of the most strikingly beautiful places on Earth just to get some clout. And dozens of people die on their way, and stay there forever.

witcher,feld0mn,t1_fek1m08,1579219294.0,Actually Sapkowski wrote the sorceresses in an incredibly compelling way and the way they weaponized their looks is a core part of that. You'd know if you weren't so quick to judge.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fekpna4,t1_fekj86x,1579205001.0,I don't think you read the post correctly? Expecting the other person to finance your lifestyle that's not really yours since you can't afford it has nothing to do with our PMS lmao. Idk about you but I'd feel offended if a man insisted on paying my bills because I menstruate
BlackPeopleTwitter,fekpepb,t1_fekig98,1579204859.0,I don't think the post is about that. Plenty of women out there expecting men to do the financial heavy lifting without giving a lot back.

gaming,fekm3ah,t1_fekjsaj,1579202888.0,You got it!
gaming,feke1nn,t1_fekakvd,1579198096.0,It all aligns. Duny is an alias Emhyr always planned on ditching so he faked his death. Pavetta really did die though...
gaming,fekdv94,t1_feju6f8,1579197986.0,I think big part of it is that Emhyr would rather leave his life as Duny in the past. And Geralt is one of the very few people who know about it
gaming,fekdlug,t1_fejx22f,1579197829.0,I think he was always like that. The fact that he basically manipulated the law of surprise and Pavetta into falling in love with him says it all
gaming,fekdbey,t1_fekcz86,1579197656.0,"It was an evil genocidal spirit, I'd try to kill it too!!!"
gaming,fekcz5r,t1_fejvyhr,1579197456.0,"He didn't have her legitimately. I'm pretty sure his life as Duny is a secret not many people know and there aren't many alive people around that could recognize him. Also it's worth noting that marrying Ciri would be a huge political move, since Cintra kinda became a symbol and uniting Cintra and Nilfgaard through marriage would be HUGE"
gaming,fekcpmy,t1_fek3ujt,1579197301.0,He's a master manipulator. He played her like a true sociopath. Basically preyed on her to make his evil ways happen. And she was very young and naive... Scummy motherfucker. He should have stayed a hedgehog!
gaming,fekcknf,t1_fejunb1,1579197219.0,I can't get over what he did to Pavetta. She really loved him... She really risked it all for him... And she really died...
gaming,fekcfby,t1_fejrrkq,1579197134.0,I wouldn't say he has plenty of empathy. Pretty much a ruthless emperor as evil as they come. This may have been the last shred of humanity he had left. He does have some redeeming qualities. In the Witcher-verse not many people are straight up bad or good. Even - and maybe especially - our protagonists. And that's why the story is so good.
gaming,fekbzgi,t1_fekadnq,1579196870.0,"That's like, the whole point of the story... Nobody really is that great. Geralt himself and his best friends did some baaaaad shit"

gaming,fekbnj8,t1_fek038y,1579196672.0,If you free the spirit it also kills the entire village. And it's a safe bet it will continue on killing...
