Also I thought the differentiation had to do with fixed vs. removable floats."
ThatsInsane,fh33fy1,t3_f18qxg,1581264286.0,That's not a seaplane. That's a Piper on floats.

One shows the push style connectors. They're far superior to the twist type. Easier installation, and less likely to work their way loose of time. 

The other image shows a twist type ground pigtail. Notice the wire coming directly out the front. Also an easier installation."
HomeImprovement,ffor0hx,t1_ffmffa1,1580080651.0,"It's slightly more expensive, but far easier to buy premade pigtails. Same end result but it doesn't force one of the connections to bend at a 90° angle. This results in less chances for the wire to become unsecured, after repeated stress."

wallstreetbets,ff0oe89,t3_eqxijk,1579470766.0,"I live in farm country. It's not that they're complicated to fix, it's more that the companies have restricted the parts ans software to repair. These farmers can fix nearly anything they need to, but when they can even buy the parts to do so, they'll look elsewhere. 

One of the other tactics that they're using, is to jailbreak their tractors. I believe it's somewhere in Eastern Europe that they get the software from."
