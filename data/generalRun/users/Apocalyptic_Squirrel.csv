coolguides,ffe1wn9,t1_ffdjgn6,1579834554.0,"Cook it low and slow and take temperature readings frequently. Remove from heat when it's about ten degrees below your desired doneness. It will carryover cook while sitting. Let it rest for a few minutes. Also basting helps a lot too.

interestingasfuck,fetxdqe,t1_fetvvvo,1579381031.0,Yeah like I could do it. But I wouldn't be happy at the end. And sure as shit I couldn't keep that up for any proper time. The cheetah could run.

natureismetal,fetd1rf,t1_fet7306,1579374064.0,"They literally do not have the physiological or biochemical structures required to process thought. I get that they are conscious in a way, such as reacting to stimuli and communicating with other plants through chemicals released into the air or through root systems, but they are not self aware. At least not on the level of animals or humans. 

I get that ""we don't know everything"". But this plant flat out is not thinking about eating the flies. It's responding to mechanical stimulus and inputs like a computer does. If A happens, then do B.     If two triggers are activated, close leaves. 

But hey I'm not a plant what do I know"

AskReddit,fcwq3wt,t1_fcwmd0g,1578033256.0,The first three weeks are the worst. After a month you should trim it so it's all even and let it continue to grow for another month. Then trim it back a tiny bit so it's even again. Different parts of your face will grow faster so of you just let it all go it'll be uneven and rough looking. The trick to a nice beard is to grow it out longer than you want it and trim it back to an even level. That makes it nice and full
