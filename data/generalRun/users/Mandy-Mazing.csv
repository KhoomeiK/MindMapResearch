Instead with the mentality people have these days we apply government purchasing standards to building fucking houses. 3 proposals, lowest bid and nicest fucking packets.

xboxone,ffwgve9,t1_ffvzg7g,1580300562.0,They have to be version matching or newer and the OSU files on the system update partition on the hard drive get updated with every release. The ones on the website don’t. If you’re hard drive functions you can factory reset and it restores from the hard drive. If your hard drive is broken then you’re SOL until they update those files
xboxinsiders,ffwgr73,t1_ffw3u70,1580300441.0,That would be nice. The other guy is just being a prick. I also don’t know why you’re being downvoted
xboxinsiders,ffwgq7j,t1_ffwg3y8,1580300413.0,I came here because it’s one of the only Xbox support forums. I do not have an insider build. The OSU files on the Xbox site are for an older version of the system software. Microsoft has not updated them since December. This happens all of the time and I just need the latest version of those files. Instead of being a petty little shit you could read what I posted and stop treating people like they’re stupid.
xboxone,ffwgl6b,t1_ffw3qmp,1580300270.0,Yeah it’s really frustrating. You think they’d be more on things like this

You’ll find fillers and meat adhesives in even the best quality cuts for a variety of reasons. Ground meat especially so. It’s pathetic that people have this presumption that anything added to food is bad and is really damaging. People need serious education about where food comes from, the real dangers and what actual dangerous additives are."

Even if I go to my local butcher (that I’m lucky to have, thank you Amish community) there’s some additives. Otherwise it wouldn’t keep the same, bacteria and dirt would adhere to the meat easier. There’s additives in food. It’s a marvel of modern technology. And subway is indeed trash, Wawa and Jason’s deli are superior"

If the hsf surface is flat enough and the mounting bracket even then it will squeeze out almost all of it. There’s also the “suction” effect that happens when you remove a heat sink that makes it appear that there’s a lot more paste on there than actually was.
