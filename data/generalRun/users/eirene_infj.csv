agathachristie,ffioewc,t1_ffhl3cz,1579978735.0,Have you seen the recent movie adaptation of Crooked House with Glenn Close and Gillian Anderson? It's on Amazon Prime and it's sooooo good. It feels as creepy as the book was. I wish all AC novels were adapted in that way.
agathachristie,ffhhyyd,t3_etmast,1579936071.0,"If you want to get into her (an excellent decision btw), I'd suggest starting with The Mysterious Affair at Styles  (Poiroit's first book) or Murder at the Vicarage (Miss Marple's first book). Most of her books are one of those series. You can really read them in any order. But those are both good books and the vicar narrates Murder at the Vicarage and he's very funny. Some of my other favorite titles are:
Towards Zero,
The Man in the Brown Suit,
After the Funeral (Poiroit),
A Murder is Announced  (Marple),
Murder on the Orient Express  (P),
The Hollow (P) ,
The Secret Adversary  (Tommy and Tuppence),
The Moving Finger (M)

The Mysterious Affair at Styles and The Secret Adversary are available for free on Kindle. They're old enough to be on public record. The Man in the Brown Suit may be as well (I already own it but I think I read it's availabe).

I have many more favorites. She's such a fun author. Her mysteries are clever and she is very insightful about human nature. I hope you enjoy her books as much as I do!"

cats,fepik9v,t1_fepi0u7,1579321409.0,"I totally needed to see this today. Thanks for sharing! It'll be so much easier to be patient and let them get more acclimated in their own time knowing that even if it's slow to progress, change is still possible. Hope you get continued happy moments with your two fur babies."
cats,fepb4ik,t1_fep0d8n,1579316231.0,I was coming on to say this same thing! I took a kitty in this fall and my resident cat HATES him. I totally thought she'd be chill but I was wrong and very wrong. But there's hope!!!
lawofattraction,fedp4nb,t1_fediej6,1579016840.0,"The only way I've found lately that I can listen to that music without feeling down is watching reaction videos on YouTube. There's this channel called Lost In Vegas where these 2 guys with more of a hip hop background listen to other genres and react to stuff they haven't listened to before. Their take on grunge is fun to listen to. But otherwise, yeah, as much as it was my sorts hey day, the music and media of the time was pretty depressing. So good, but sad af."

cats,fe9f2fw,t1_fe9eo6r,1578937034.0,"Thanks! And it is! But it's a trap. If you touch him when he's doing that he will attack, little stinker."
cats,fe9c78a,t1_fe9bxc3,1578936266.0,"Why thank you! And yeah, he's a cute goofball+"

entp,fe8ru7j,t1_fe8mjhg,1578929941.0,Thanks! I totally had not noticed that it was LOL
entp,fe5l0dk,t3_enupgw,1578870793.0,That's horribly brilliant. Well played.
lawofattraction,fe4vn0w,t3_enn9vg,1578863186.0,"Oh, this is absolutely true. I've become very adament about only watching/reading content that makes me feel better. It means like 90%+ of pop culture passes me by, but personally it's worth it to me. Missing out honestly is fine with me, but having the conversations over and over again about how I am not, in fact, watching the show that everyone is insane about  (especially happened about GoT, but American Horror Story too) gets me a lot of flack. Still worth it. I remember watching Brokeback Mountain and Les Miserable and I just felt sad for days afterwards. It's simply not worth it."
lawofattraction,fe4uevi,t1_fe34sni,1578862865.0,"Yeah, I loved Nirvana in high school, even was able to see them live. But if I listen to their music,more than just an odd song here and there, I feel depressed. Bleach especially. Also true of NIN Pretty Hate Machine, which is an amazing album. It's just not worth it to listen and feel bad, but I do miss the music if I'm honest."
