offmychest,fehp1q1,t1_fefnfnr,1579121017.0,"My brother (Jonathan) passed away 2 1/2 years ago.. it’s so crazy - I think this year will be extremely difficult for me. You see, I’m the baby of the family- my brother is exactly three years older than me (same birthday - different years) and this year I turn the age he was when he passed. It’s mind-fucking. I can’t even begin to wrap my head around being the same age & then older than my brother. As far as the survivors guilt, I found my best way of dealing with it is by carrying my brothers ashes in a necklace that I wear so I always try and include “him” in all of my experiences. When i traveled to Denver,Co, that was technically his first plane ride. I’ve taken him across Europe, moved across the country with him (from New Orleans to Portland area). 
The necklace i bought isn’t a typical crematory necklace - I wanted something that wasn’t so obvious, I found a brass acorn necklace on amazon that people store oils in so I bought that and scooped some of his ashes in there and superglued the lid on. I have it on a long chain so on a bad day I fidget with it and try to imagine what his advice to me would be. Just a few things that have helped me with grieving his loss and keeping his memory alive. Sending you all of my love..  we will grieve, we will mourn & we will live to fight another day because that’s what we do..."
offmychest,fefb57f,t1_feezgt0,1579052440.0,"I had a crazy fear of that when my brother died. I decided to write all of the memories and jokes I could think of that we’ve shared together then I was devastated at the thought that it was all from my point of view and half the joy of reminiscing with a sibling (at least in my family) is them disputing and calling “bullshit” on half the things you say. Fuck, it sucks so badly! :( 
I’m sorry you lost a sibling and I’m even more sorry that you’ve noticed your memories fading :("
offmychest,fefaetv,t3_eojf0n,1579051955.0,"I’ll never forget the day I received the “news” about my brother- it’s been 2  1/2 years and not a single day goes by without me thinking of him and missing him. You’ll miss him every day and although I can’t say it gets “easier”, I CAN say you’ll be able to say his name and smile/laugh instead of cry..  Journaling might help you process the devastating pain, I know it helped a great deal for me. I’m sorry you’re a part of this shitty club - I wish it wasn’t this way. Sending you all of my love."
