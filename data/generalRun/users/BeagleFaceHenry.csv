You posted an insulting comment on a public forum. A public forum is specifically designed to elicit conversation and opinion, not only the opinions you’re hoping for (don’t worry, you’ll learn that when you get a little older). 

Here’s a thinker for ya. Are you smarter today than you were 10 years ago? How about 5 years ago? How about 1? Will you smarter in 5 years than you are now? How about 10?  For the sake of argument, I’ll assume you’re smarter now than you were, and you’ll be smarter in 10 years than you are now. If that’s true, at what age do you start getting dumber? And how many years does it take to get back to dumber than you are today?  

This is what you’re insinuating. You’re suggesting that when you become a member of the older generation, you’ll somehow know less than kids in their 20s. 

Have you considered that the older generation has FAR more experience with the internet because we built it. We’re the lead designers engineers who brought you 5G and AI. 

Have you considered that your view of this subject is blinded by your limited exposure?

And, lastly, do me a favor. Save this post and read it in 20 years. Email me, or however the kids are talking then, and let me know you’re feelings on the subject. Make your prediction. Will you be proved right that the older generation knows less (meaning you’re dumber in 20 years than you are now)? Or wrong because you already know everything?
