slp,fgcrxac,t1_fgcoa10,1580675733.0,Ah excellent points. Thank you. That makes a heck of a lot of sense. My mistake for missing that.
slp,fgcl5nx,t3_expez2,1580673684.0,"I'm not sure I understand where you think these two are related, save for when you make public speeches. However, I will state what I know about stuttering and compare your definition of aphantasia. 

Stuttering, true stuttering, is not situational. There are some words some people who stutter report are consistently harder for them to say (e.g., the word ""stuttering"" may be hard for then to say). This cannot be fixed simple by imagining themselves reducing their rate of speech or picturing it happening in a different manner. It is not the situations that cause them to stutter but instead it is a neuromotor dysfunction that causes the stutter. PWS do often report psychological problems in addition to stuttering, but it is more likely that the stuttering which causes negative reactions from neurotypicals in turn causes anxiety, shame, depression, possibly even hypervigilance. In fact, I have heard evidence that suggests that PWS possess a form of hyper self awareness. A friend and colleague of mine who stutters often described to me the loops and tricks he had when speaking with others. He'd plan out words a head of time being ever so careful to avoid ones he knows he stutters on, possibly ""seeing"" how he might stutter. This alone could suggest that stuttering and aphantasia have no link, but that is just one person. 

From a cursory Google of aphantasia, I have to guess that the reason this has not been explored is due to the fact that there is little evidence of origin of aphantasia in the first place. There appears to be a wide variety of explanations of aphantasia and but none of them have anything to do with neuromotor speech. Causing me to think that a link if any would be weak. As for other communication disorders I'd posit something similar. Aphantasia does not appear to have any link neurologically speaking to any areas of communication within the brain. You could possibly make the argument that due to the reduced ability for a person to ""visualize"" speech sounds that it might cause of delay in speech sound production, but that's a stretch because we don't just use sight or visualizstion for speech production. 

I hope that at least semi answers your question."
