DecidingToBeBetter,ffp7118,t1_fdgzkk7,1580087836.0,"We met for drinks after they were already drinking. I helped them up their stairs. I texted their neighbors saying I was gonna take care of them. That was the plan. I should have just gone home. I knew they were more drunk that I was but when they asked to make out I said yes and when they asked me to spend the night I said yes. I should have gone home. I should have tucked them in and just gone home.

Instead I was disgusting."

SuicideWatch,ffkxi3e,t1_ffkw4xt,1580030756.0,I’ve been repugnant. I’m disgustingly abusive. I’ve desecrated the most sacred portions of my life. I’ve hurt the people I’ve loved the most.
SuicideWatch,ffkvydy,t1_ffkt923,1580029986.0,"I'm sure that if I find someone who's got a better disposition to be kind and helpful and nurturing will give my dog a far better life than I'm giving him now.

I'm certain that if you knew me and my situation, you'd understand.

I'm ready to stop this all.

I just have to find my little guy a nice new home  first."

funny,ffjyfgn,t1_ffjdr20,1580010398.0,Agreed! Sex work work is work!
funny,ffjy7lw,t1_ffj3sn5,1580010224.0,I agree. This is terrible. Sex workers already put up with a lot of BS from everyone. A job is a job. All professions under our current profit-motivated systems are exploitative. That old lady is just being rude.
