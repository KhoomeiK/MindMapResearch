Uh.  Did you just try to disprove my point by indicating that he was FOR brexit, and then after being pushed to the point of comprimise, allowed for a second referendum?

Yeah, you got me: in the most extreme case possible he wouldn't force through brexit.  He's only 90% for brexit, not 100%.

Basically it causes loyalty problems.  It also sets you up for a heroic age if you do well enough to get a golden age, which I should mention at this time is EASIER in a dark age.
