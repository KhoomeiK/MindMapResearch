Do you have any ideas on how to approach the conversation? I’m not a very confrontational person and I don’t want to seem like I’m mad at her or anything. I feel like “hey are you taking pictures of me?” Might be a little direct but idk."
college,ff1lsc9,t1_ff1lhug,1579481274.0,Thank you for giving me some insight on why she actually might be doing this! I was scratching my head like... did I do something to her? I’ll try to speak to her unfortunately I’m not really good at confrontation.

YouOnLifetime,fep6aju,t3_ely072,1579313092.0,I don't understand why everyone hates Beck so much and think she's dumb. I'm assuming it's because they love Joe and anyone that is against him which is pretty ironic.

college,fdqorr8,t1_fdqlf8f,1578671622.0,I mean... you don’t have to speak to them. I just mean before class begins you have an easier opportunity to interact with people and facilitate discussion. Whether you choose to take that is up to you. Nobody said you can’t pay attention in class

college,fd4desw,t3_ek16f9,1578166574.0,I think the only thing you can do now is try to continually get high grades in your future courses to bring it up a little. Before choosing courses I would definitely say check ratemyprof if you don’t already and try to get a good prof. My school has this thing called Atlas where you can see the course’s average grade so if you have any resource like that use it before you pick classes.

ApplyingToCollege,fd4atet,t3_ek0s6g,1578165887.0,"Just want to add some perspective. Ofc this is my own experience and opinion so take it all with a grain of salt! In high school I was a big extrovert and had a tight knit friend group. That being said I still wanted to expand my circle and was excited to meet more people through college. 

I’m currently a sophomore at a big university and it’s been really hard to make close friends to the point where I’ve been feeling really isolated and it’s taking a toll on my mental health. It’s really easy to meet “friends” and have face value conversations but I find it really hard to get that deep connection I’m looking for like I had with my high school friends. Ofc a lot of this depends on the type of school you’re attending and the type of people you want to hang out with."
