uberdrivers,fea8ksz,t1_fea014j,1578945639.0,"Never. As I’m a 28F driver people get into my car and interrogate me about my life and if I have kids and why not. After years and years of being interrogated I personally think it’s rude and nosey to ask me a certain level of question so I practice the same restraint. If a passenger is getting a ride to work I would have no idea since I just have a random address and I in no way, can know ahead of time it’s “work,” unless I ask and I’m just not going to. I have customers tell me all the time they’re so thankful for my discretion and privacy.  Also, I really don’t think this situation is a binary to where asking questions equals human and not asking questions equals robots. Let’s not get stuck in a dichotomy built by you."

People ask me on the daily where I’m from, where my parents are from and whether I can speak Spanish, and why can’t I speak Spanish.  Asking these questions isn’t racist in and of itself but it’s the fact that people only ask that to brown and black people.  They only ask a white person where they’re from if they have like an accent. My literal appearance is enough to have people question my American-ness on the daily."

You are taking this scenario and blowing it up to cater to your false narrative. This driver clearly didn’t feel harassed or he would’ve stopped the ride and kicked them out, called the police, etc. This dude THANKED THEM.  Also, do you know how many thousands of rape kits have been stored away for years? This nation as a whole doesn’t take ANY SEXUAL ASSAULT victims seriously men or women. Stop making it seem like men have it any worse then women. It’s simply statistically not true."
uber,fe6jarx,t3_enxed9,1578892721.0,"Reasons why Uber drivers might drive slow. 

1. They are new and unfamiliar with the particular highway.
2. They had riders report them for speeding and they want to avoid that. 
3. We have less than 10 seconds to accept a ride or we lose it, so they could be accepting a trip on a highway and realize they might need to change lanes and trying to multitask safely is easier at a slower MPH.
4. Similar to #2, a passenger might have given them attitude or bad tip for going too fast and without tips we wouldn’t survive in terms of gas, oil changes, tire changes, car washes, etc.
5. They took a wrong route and are trying to get back on track. 

Lastly.
6. They could just be a bad driver."

uberdrivers,fe1nvel,t3_enhbjc,1578828809.0,"Are you new? Lol, not to be patronizing but this is at least 30% of the job. I am absolutely not saying it’s okay, it’s not and like you said, very unsafe to stop traffic...but. Until riders become drivers, or talk to one about it, they have almost zero empathy on logistics and safety for us in terms of OTHER cars. 

According to a majority of pax, we are supposed to come right to their side, simple as that. (Again, not saying it’s right)  You can definitely keep cancelling thats our perogative but you will def lose trips and potential tips. Taking a breath, letting traffic pass, always turn flashers ON, and getting the passenger is your best bet. Think about it, people get flats and brake down on the side of the road and 9/10 times, no one hits them. Same for you, just get the pax and get that tip for the sake of your time and effort. If that’s not possible, cancel. Only you know."
