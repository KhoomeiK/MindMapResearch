PoliticalHumor,ff5rt0o,t3_ermb2h,1579607766.0,You can be damn sure if things go south he will not take the blame. He is famous for never apologizing and I think taking the responsibility for things that went wrong under his watch is part of that.
PoliticalHumor,ff5qrtq,t1_ff56ezd,1579606492.0,Kind of reminds you of the Benghazi and private server investigations of his wife doesn't it. Right out of the republican playbook. Start an investigation and drag it out for several years and then saturate all the right wing shows with talk of finding some very damning things. By the time they announce that they have found no evkdence of wrong doing the person has been convicted in the court of public opinion.

I did it with Hillary and I would do it for Joe. Trump is the most dangerous thing to happen to this country since the civil war. More dangerous than Nixon by far. At least Nixon was a good politician. Trump, on his best day is an amateur."

Darts,fezrm53,t3_eqy1lf,1579460760.0,I bought a 2nd set of darts exactly the same as my game darts and throw all 6 for practice. I have found it helps. Especially after hitting a triple. I have learned not to let the dart cause me to lose focus on the target area and I have learned to move a bit over when an area is covered.
PoliticalHumor,feylio0,t3_eqixvv,1579447200.0,We cannot agree. 30% of the U.S. population has buried their head in the sand with Fox News. If you watch Fox News for a week and stop thinking for yourself you would think EVERYONE except Fox News is out to get Trump and he is being persecuted due to the fact that he is Jesus Christ reincarnated.

todayilearned,fed84o2,t1_fecjyfx,1579003222.0,"and the one thing he is known best for is outspending the Russians on defense until the USSR collapsed. There are some Republican values. Lets spend money until our deficit is out of control unless a Democrat is in office and then it is time to reel in those pesky ""entitlement programs"" that are out of control. 

 I am being lazy right now but I believe through the last 5 presidents or so, Republicans have raised the deficit at a higher rate than Democrats. Of course Clinton eliminated it for a short time until Bush Jr. got in office and decided it was time to give the rich tax breaks."

ChoosingBeggars,fe7rij8,t1_fe5z9dd,1578918377.0,where I work we had a few employees who would show up a few minutes late everyday. They would not clock in which caused someone above them to fix this everyday. Everyone knows what they are doing so instead of addressing the bad apples they started a new policy where if you forgot to clock in or out you had to fill out a paper and will be fired after 7 occasions in a calendar year.  Unfortunately it is always like this. They take the worse of us and make rules for everyone based on them.

It is not just the CEO but all the top tier executives, the board of directors and shareholders greed. It is sad to think how very few people impact so many in a bad way. 

 Of course it is convenient to blame Kaepernick since the right don't like the fact he kneeled. Stay in your lane and don't disrespect our country unless it is Kid Rock, Curt Schilling or Ted Nugent when Obama was in office then it is their freedom of speech we should be protecting."

PoliticalHumor,fdc43uv,t3_ekhewa,1578266721.0,They want us to forget that most of the terrorist from 9/11 were Saudi's but now all the sudden we are to believe that Iran was behind it.

PoliticalHumor,fdbzqgw,t3_ekh38d,1578264419.0,"When republicans saw the writing on the wall that they were not going to be the majority in the future they decided they had to cheat to win. Gerrymandering, voter suppression, and with the help of Moscow Mitch they have loaded the courts with conservative judges. 

 If Moscow Mitch were to have something horrible happen to him health wise, I wouldn't feel sorry for him. He has been a horrible person as a public servant. Trying to do what is best interest of the rich and screwing over the majority of voters.

  Unfortunately when he retires there will be another corporate lackey asshat to take his place."
PoliticalHumor,fdaxtxw,t1_fdao6iz,1578251656.0,"Which Reagan did not recall. Either due to selective memory or Alzheimer's. George H.W. Bush completed the cover up in his final days as President by pardoning 6 people who were involved in Iran Contra including Casper Wineburger who was supposedly going to testify that Bush Sr. was involved also. Guess who was the Attorney General who advised Bush Sr. on the pardons....... William Barr.

 It amazes me how history has painted Reagan  as if he was some kind of Republican superhero. He left office disgraced by Iran-Contra. He turned his back on Vietnam veterans who were really struggling after coming home. A lot of homelessness due to ptsd and Reagans answer was they need to help themselves and finally he pretended the AIDS epidemic wasn't happening until it started to get out of control."

I don't do facebook for that reason. As far as following up and checking several sources, you are correct. As far as the family I just lumped it all together. I did not divide it by the number of family members. I guess my point  is that they reap as much as possible and give as little as they can to the people who do most of the work. Hence the IDGAF attitude you find when you go into Walmart."
