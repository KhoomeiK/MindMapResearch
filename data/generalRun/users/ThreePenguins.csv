relationship_advice,ffjlamf,t3_etudyh,1580000847.0,"I used to be the fat friend, having the same worries you had. I was a very worried fat person, thinking anyone would prefer the company of a skinnier one (be it as roommate, employee, friend, dog walker, romantic partner or anything else). I've lost a considerable amount of weight and have been in the healthy range for 2 years now. 

There were some ""friends"" who have been approaching me extremly differently since I've lost the weight - suddenly, they want to take pictures together, etc. But honestly: I've ditched those people. I realised that I used to be their ""fat friend"" they could compare themselves with to feel better. I'm not sure what I am to them now, but I don't wanna be it. 

But the good friends? They haven't changed at all. And your friends definitely sound like good ones. 

I myself also used to care more about body sizes in the past than now (wondering whether I'm the fattest person around, etc.). Now that I am myself skinny,  I don't care about body sizes at all anymore - my own body size is just not in my mind all the time the way it used to. I think that having an issue with the body size of your friends and people around you are just a reflection of the issues you have with your own body (excluding serious concern, medical situations, etc.)."
