You must not be very good at selling things. You realize TCG Player sells thousands of cards each day. If you have a card that is in high demand, you're going to sell a lot of them. Sell it for 2% lower and you could move inventory much faster than a few months. Plus, ABU doesn't sell just MTG singles, or just MTG.

learnprogramming,fehmy8g,t3_ep3x10,1579119809.0,"1. I don't feel comfortable stating the name of the company, but we work in the delivery software industry.

2. We use a combination of SQL server and SQLite. SQL server for the central DB and SQLite for local handheld (mobile phones and tablets) DB.

3. Our databases store the data needed for delivery operations. For a very limited scope of use: if a company delivers beer to a set of convenience stores, they use our software on the desktop to create delivery routes. A delivery route might have a truck, a customer, the day that customer gets delivered to, etc. A truck will go out in the morning with the report of what is on their truck and what customers in what order. They make a stop at each customer and deliver the goods. They might even create a ""presale"" while there. Which then gets sent to the desktop where the warehouse will pick that order for the next time that truck goes to that location. The software also links into accounting software such as quickbooks, so there is a lot going on there, too. This is a ***very*** small chunk of what the software does, but it should give you a good idea. One of our customers has 193 tables in one SQL server DB. That same DB has a table with the most rows at 1,129,437 rows. Second largest table is 1,118,592. It's a large DB and that's only one of our clients.

4. The benefits are pretty obvious based on what I just described. My wife works for a logistics company. She works on a team of 4 that handle a specific client (""SunBucks"" coffee) and she is the only one who manages a specific set of data through their spreadsheet system. They use Excel to manage all of the records and the first 30 minutes of her day is just letting that report run. With SQL it would likely take 30 seconds. The company doesn't want to move to a DB, so don't ask me why they don't use it. I can't think of downsides unless you are talking about relational vs. object databases. Even then, there really aren't disadvantages to any database type, just the different use cases I suppose."

RaidShadowLegends,fdntwvw,t3_e9ij64,1578592753.0,"[Here's my champ list](https://imgur.com/a/5ajU8tx). I could use some help on who to move around. I am at the point where I have a few options after doing a main team of #1-5 on CB and #s 1, 3, 4, and 5 on everything else. I'm SIII in Arena, but don't focus on that much more than just the daily or missions, I would like to do better there. I get to about stage 12-13 on most dungeons, 9 on Spider.

1. One main question I have is replacing Madame Serris with Mausoleum Mage. Serris is awesome in Arena where she takes everything away from the team right after they buffed first round, then makes them vulnerable to my AOEs from Dark Athel and Pitiless One. I haven't used Mausoleum Mage because I haven't maxed him out to compare to Serris, so I'm wondering if I should focus on him to do so.

2. Another question is whether I have a good composition. I don't really have a tank, so should I add one? If so, who do I pull (I'm thinking dark Athel)?

3. With having Serris *and* Mage, do I put both in and focus more on utility than quick damage?

Do you see any other spots where I can trade out? Here's the mentality I've had with my team so far:

* Raglin is a great healer/revive. I have her maxed, so I can revive every other turn. The heal is awesome, but takes a little bit to cool down. She hits for almost as much as any of my other attackers.

* Pitiless One is a great AOE, plus main attack hits hard if equipped right, but after the AOE he's slow.

* Dark Athel is a great AOE with two AOE hits, but after her juice has run out, she's usually the first to go.

* Serris is explained above. I have her go second so the other team can buff their guys before she takes them away. No point in her taking them away just before they buff, so her speed requirement is replaced with accuracy.

* Relic Keeper I have fused 2 times, and continue to do so for a replacement to using tomes. He has a good kit with the extra turn and increased damage, but he needs to be the last one in the turn to really do something for me and that isn't exactly where I want to be."
