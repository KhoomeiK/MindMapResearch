patientgamers,ff9997u,t1_ff7g8t3,1579707773.0,How is the gameplay loop in that? It looks right up my alley but I’m nervous it’ll be too gathering heavy to be fun.

NintendoSwitch,ff649a3,t1_ff3y7hf,1579618746.0,I was just starting to suspect foul play when the dude was like “1 to 1 motion controls” and the dude playing the game rapidly spun in place like link does lol

NintendoSwitchDeals,ff3ks9q,t1_ff3jmjs,1579543154.0,"From what I understand these Dynasty Warriors games (which this is just an entry of with a Zelda skin) are all essentially the same game, have you ever tried any of the other Dynasty Warrior games?"
EnterTheGungeon,ff34k6r,t1_ff2nnw8,1579533507.0,"I personally prefer a mouse and keyboard but I have the switch version and PC and I’ve put in a good amount of time into both and I don’t think the Switch Version is harder by any means, unless they’re specifically talking about playing in handheld mode."
AskReddit,fetsm9s,t1_fet88h8,1579379581.0,"I love Memories of Murder but it’s got some tone issues at points. It’s a long, slow and dark movie so I get having 1 or 2 jokes to make it not so oppressive but a few I thought were poorly timed and lessened the impact of some of the dramatic scenes they happened in (also for a serious drama, quite a few people get drop kicked in that movie).

But that’s my only gripe and if you’re reading this and haven’t seen Memories of Murder, do yourself a favor and watch it the next time you are in a movie mood."
AskReddit,fetrs06,t1_feso05v,1579379150.0,And the narrator can only truly be her friend after he sheds himself of his own toxic mascilinity by killing Tyler/that part of himself. I love how much my view of that movie has changed since I first saw it at 14.
thanosdidnothingwrong,fesfzpv,t3_eqdsnk,1579364789.0,"I thought it was an odd choice for him to say that. I get that he was just living his own life and felt no more obligation to the Avengers but Sam was like his best friend for years, you’d think he’d give the guy a few minutes to catch up."
gaming,fednbmo,t1_fedltw6,1579015690.0,If league is good for one thing it’s keeping people together. I stopped playing both casually and ranked 3 or 4 years ago but I keep the client installed because many of my childhood friends still play and when I miss them I can always find them in discord for a game or two.

NatureIsFuckingLit,fdh322n,t1_fdgz98u,1578414313.0,The color scheme of his scales reminds me of the theme song with the blood and food against the white background
nintendomusic,fdadlzf,t3_ekecf9,1578244865.0,Second favorite windwaker track after Makar’s theme/Main theme. So adventurous.
savedyouaclick,fcl3wec,t1_fcju1v0,1577739251.0,Cinema over Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites? Interesting choice.

starterpacks,fckqsqq,t1_fckptp7,1577731185.0,Their over aggressive ad campaigns/branding are annoying but I’d say Surly has proven it can match its talk with genuinely good beers. They wouldn’t be so in demand if people didn’t want to drink the beer they made.
starterpacks,fckqm9y,t1_fckq43q,1577731074.0,"Yeah this discussion happens any time the domestic beer crowd wants to feel special. IPAs can be piney, they can be sweet, bittersweet or just bitter, and there’s a huge variety in between. All that gets lost when your palette only knows light Lagers."
todayilearned,fckl0l9,t1_fckkkul,1577727630.0,The simplest explanation is usually the simplest: if he’s real he’s a sadist and not benevolent. Seems pretty clear.
NintendoSwitchDeals,fchuvg4,t1_fcg58ma,1577654423.0,"They're pretty great games. I have to say though if you have a PC, all three of these games go on sale all the time with the first two usually being under 5 bucks, 30 dollars is a lot for the three of them even considering the Switch tax."
starterpacks,fchtxm5,t1_fchoxra,1577654095.0,"To follow up on this the term comes from the controlling parent's tendency to always ""hover"" around their children to exert control over them."
bestoflegaladvice,fchotta,t3_ehb7d2,1577652563.0,I gotta say I have very little sympathy here for either party. The valet is an idiot but this sounds like a non issue if nothing happened to the car. Park it yourself if you're gonna get your designer panties in a twist about your beautiful corvette.

AskReddit,fc316up,t1_fc30ax1,1577379115.0,The entire population has been wrong before. And tomatoes are oversoft and oversweet pieces of sandwich ruining garbage.
movies,fc21tjm,t1_fc1va5m,1577337067.0,Yeah the CGI is definitely disappointing but it’s a fine movie. Especially when compared against other modern horror movies/reboots.
todayilearned,fc2105g,t1_fc1z0nn,1577336207.0,Ports are the saving grace of mobile. If you like old school RPGs there’s ports of lots of old Final Fantasy games and the Chrono games.
gameofthrones,fbzbha7,t1_fbz6989,1577241168.0,I think the main difference is the focus on a few characters interacting with the larger world (The Witcher with Ciri and Geralt) as opposed to GOT’s sprawling political web with dozens of prominent characters. For better or worse the Witcher is much more intimate.
