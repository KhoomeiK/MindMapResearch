Taxidermy,fffh759,t3_etbyuv,1579883884.0,"What a beautiful specimen! I'm so jealous, the most I can do is bugs."
wowthanksimcured,fffbwrp,t1_fffbkuc,1579880567.0,"Thank you for the advice. I'm definitely going to recommend she sees a therapist as she has some other anxieties I think she should talk about, too. However, as it did with my therapist, I hope that she has some epiphanies about how her dad is treating her and maybe opens her eyes a little. I just hope that her dad doesn't prevent her from seeing the therapist. I know that if we moved out together that it would be better for her (but not better for me). I'm going to keep at it, but I do realize I'm not a superhero. I'll remember my limitations and just give her as much love and support as I can."
wowthanksimcured,ffercjc,t1_ffekg4y,1579861712.0,"Thank you so much for snaring and I’m so sorry that happened to you. I really do hope some of the things I say sink in. She could fly without him and she just doesn’t realize it. But you’re right, it’s probably going to take a lot of hard work. At least I’m doing the right thing here. I just want her to be happy and free."
wowthanksimcured,ffdwlao,t1_ffdvvdc,1579830724.0,Hopefully our family meeting with a broker tomorrow will help. I doubt I'll qualify for anything with mental health coverage but hopefully I can keep my doctor and my meds. Keep your fingers crossed for me...
wowthanksimcured,ffdvloz,t1_ffdvep2,1579830024.0,Next month for me! Gotta love temp work and pre-existing conditions!
Entomology,ffdkjd9,t3_esvv4s,1579822825.0,"I remember the first time I had one of these little shits pull this on me. I was fresh out of an intensive entomology class and I still flinched. Luckily, I didn't drop him and he grew into a beautiful moth."
wowthanksimcured,ffdegju,t3_et07li,1579819161.0,"I can't even get my one good friend to understand that she's being emotionally abused and manipulated by her father, how is she supposed to help me with my PTSD? God, it's people like this who make me terrified about losing my insurance :("
Anxiety,ffcluda,t3_ej018w,1579802202.0,"I definitely have this. I house and pet-sit a lot and even though I love it, I can't sleep and have horrible anxiety from sleeping in places that aren't my home. Last time I was out I had a horrible anxiety attack that left me hyperventilating on the floor while the dog I was petsitting was whining and pawing at me to try and get me to calm down. I'm horrified of leaving my childhood home and moving into an apartment."
AskReddit,feor9v9,t3_eptxb3,1579304367.0,"My dad and uncle had a half-brother (grandpa's first marriage) that they never talk about. I didn't even know he was dead until last year when my mom told me. Apparently his family wants to reconnect but dad and uncle's family won't let them because of something the half-brother said forever ago. He died of a brain cancer that was hereditary (grandpa's first wife also died of it). I want to ask my dad about it but I'm afraid of what he'll say. I don't think he has any animosity towards the family but he's the shy one so he doesn't like to speak out in support of things because his brother and family shut him down quick and harsh.

Also, that uncle stole most of the things my grandpa had left to my dad. It's also never discussed. His mom didn't try to stop it, either. We're all the black sheep of the family on both sides, so I feel very protective of my dad."
Anxiety,feoj3d7,t3_eq5lp4,1579300829.0,"I'm more scared of others dying. In terms of me dying, I only fear that I will die and my family will not know and will forever be searching for the answer."

bulletjournal,fenmujx,t1_fenmgua,1579288029.0,I rarely buy hardcover books but when I do I try to take extra good care of them. Now I'll be able to do the same with my journals!
bulletjournal,fenmabv,t1_fenlz8j,1579287725.0,I do this with my hardcover books! Why didn't I think of doing it to my journals?! Thank you so much!
bulletjournal,fenebz3,t1_fene68v,1579282861.0,Oh I hadn't thought of that. The ones we have at the office are very tight so maybe I'll try Walmart for some that are a bit looser. Thank you!

Journaling,fee9a90,t3_eomv7d,1579029045.0,"That's so cool! I really want to get over my sticker anxiety. I have really bad OCD and when I was little, placing stickers gave me panic attacks- especially if I couldn't remove the sticker once it was placed. I want to make stuff like this though, and express my interests. Maybe I just need to start small like your little birdie."

ptsd,fdkd6hl,t1_fdkcynb,1578501378.0,I'm glad that you are healing and I'm sorry you had to find comfort in something unhealthy. I am lucky that I haven't reached that point. You are so brave for marching on.
ptsd,fdkchag,t1_fdkc496,1578500958.0,I think part of me avoids working in that area because it hurts in a different way than my other traumas and hurts. I hope we can learn more about ourselves and grow and bury the past to feed the roots of the future.
ptsd,fdk7hfn,t1_fdj6z30,1578497831.0,"Thank you so much. I hope that all is going well on your end. I wish that we would all heal and be free of our torment. I want to continue to be brave, but I know that with baby steps forward come equal steps backward. I will march on."
ptsd,fdk7dj6,t1_fdjflo9,1578497760.0,Thank you. I know my situation is (unfortunately) not unique. I just wish I could be as supportive to myself as I am to those who sympathize or empathize. It's going to be a long road.
ptsd,fdk7ase,t1_fdjtjyn,1578497710.0,"I've told my mom and I'm sure she's told my dad. I honestly don't think that anyone would be able to do anything since it's been two decades and since my memory is still foggy. I did find him on Facebook recently. He has a wife and two daughters. It made me sick but also more terrified to know that he's still there, just on the other side of the mountains. I don't know if I could get the emotional/mental energy to confront him."
lotr,fdinhnp,t1_fdin53n,1578446845.0,Okay I understand where you are going but I’m just trying to look for some fun ideas! I get that Tolkien is the god and he created this universe but *what if* he had opened it to sharing and other authors were as good as him? Play along with me! What kind of cool stuff do you want to know about? What happened to the blue wizards? What did Smaug do before taking over the mountain? How did Aragorn and Legolas become friends? Imagine there were other authors that *could* work in the universe. Use your imagination!
lotr,fdimu2b,t1_fdimq8v,1578446427.0,"Do you have any recommendations?!
I guess I’m a shared universe the author would approve of the fiction."
lotr,fdimoas,t1_fdilmk8,1578446323.0,"I guess I’m not making myself clear. In an ideal world where Tolkien himself opened the Middle Wart universe to a shared universe with no limitations to his own organization of the lore. I’m talking about idealism, not what’s actually happened. Like a parallel universe!"
lotr,fdilar7,t1_fdikou3,1578445436.0,I guess I meant in an ideal world not with any of the actual limitations of Tolkien or his son...
dndnext,fdicvip,t3_elgq2a,1578440028.0,"As someone who can't paint to save their life, I'm super excited about this!

As someone who doesn't make a lot of money, I am not so excited about this..."
writing,fdi98bz,t1_fdh4l4o,1578438007.0,Definitely going to use this as my motto come NaNoWriMo this year!
writing,fdi94nv,t3_elcwqc,1578437954.0,"This is the exact reason I will never enjoy my cousin's writing and why she will never be published. She reads, but she doesn't enjoy big authors and ends up reading indie stuff (no hate on indie stuff but she wants to be JK Rowling). She doesn't write descriptions well and doesn't enjoy books that are descriptive. She and her friend are 'writing' a book based on their D&D characters but don't read other works written similarly and so have no reference as to how bad their writing really is. My friend, love her to death, has the same problem. She wants to write a Tolkien level novel but only reads YA books written by similar authors on similar subjects. She has never finished an adult fantasy.

You gotta read and you gotta read around, folks. Don't just read self-published or popcorn literature. Read the big wigs and the hidden gems. Your style will improve and change and your readers will thank you later. Spoken as a beta and ARC reader."
atheism,fdeiwyh,t1_fdeil1v,1578339995.0,I thought JK Rowling was a Christian or Catholic? I didn't think about Atwood but I definitely think you're right on her

DaenerysWinsTheThrone,fcuk30t,t3_eipc42,1577982797.0,"Honestly I would love one of these. I was always a Barbie girl but now that I'm in to epic fantasy, I wish more dolls were made in the genre. I want a Barbie with a sword!"
