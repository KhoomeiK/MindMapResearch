Terraria,ff717ar,t3_es0dlj,1579639082.0,"For the destroyer, stay high up so he cant reach you, though you need to dodge the lasers and probes. Also get a nimbus rod to attack him constantly and trust me, it makes defeating him very easy. For the twins get cursed arrows since they aren't immune to cursed flames and i shredded them with the same repeater you have, so just run back while shooting and turn at the end of the platform when they do the charging attack. Get spazmatism (green eye) first and after he's gone, retinazor (red eye) is pretty simple to deal with. Do skeletron prime last since a megashark really helps. You can make one after defeating the destroyer. focus down his laser shooter first to make it way easier. Once that is down shoot his skull from a distance since the rest of his weapons can only hurt you if you touch them, and their reach isnt very far.
Side note: if you did destroyer before the twins, use the megashark instead of your repeater. It is a lot easier."
