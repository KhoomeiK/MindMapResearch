The waves crash on you but they do subside, and then another. Take care of yourself as best you can. You may not want to, but eat, shower, and sleep. If you have the opportunity to talk to a friend, talking helps. But please don’t end up like me, I don’t care for myself at all and it has taken its toll. Take any little comfort you can. A hot chocolate, sitting in a comfortable chair, pleasing music (even if that means heavy metal, techno, gangster rap, whatever your music is that feels good. I like Pink Floyd.)
