In general horror seems to be split half and half by gender, though I can't find an in-depth source I like:

“And we’re not just talking about psychological spookfests like 2002’s *The Ring* (60 percent female), 2004’s *The Grudge* (65 percent female) and 2005’s *The Exorcism of Emily Rose* (51 percent female). We’re also talking about all the slice-and-dice remakes and sequels that Hollywood churns out.” [http://www.marketingmovies.net/news/horror-films-and-the-women-that-love-them/](http://www.marketingmovies.net/news/horror-films-and-the-women-that-love-them/)

menwritingwomen,fd5f777,t3_ek1ini,1578177018.0,"The romance ([https://www.huffpost.com/entry/who-is-the-the-romance-novel-reader\_b\_7192588](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/who-is-the-the-romance-novel-reader_b_7192588)) and porn ([https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-porn-gap-gender-differences-in-pornography-use-in-couple-relationships](https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-porn-gap-gender-differences-in-pornography-use-in-couple-relationships)) breakdowns are true. I don't really see how the male porn use is relevant to emotion being only a component. Women liking romance novels as proof of their greater interest in human emotion is a bit more convincing, but indeed kinda crass.

I'm not sure if the original statements are true, and it's a little hard to search for. But I found the source of the paragraph ([https://books.google.ro/books?id=AOGsDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=""females+like+experiences""+richness+of+emotion&source=bl&ots=BLVTnM3P2a&sig=ACfU3U2yd4sRIEwuxHLR9u6iyIcshQmM4g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiK8\_jY-urmAhXVvosKHUUOBVAQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=""females%20like%20experiences""%20richness%20of%20emotion&f=false](https://books.google.ro/books?id=AOGsDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=""females+like+experiences""+richness+of+emotion&source=bl&ots=BLVTnM3P2a&sig=ACfU3U2yd4sRIEwuxHLR9u6iyIcshQmM4g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiK8_jY-urmAhXVvosKHUUOBVAQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=""females%20like%20experiences""%20richness%20of%20emotion&f=false)) (The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses, Third Edition, page 128). There is a disclaimer about two pages up (page 126, under ""The Medium is the Misogynist"") about making generalisations based on sex. It flat out says *right above the paragraph* that this is a stereotype.

It's unfairly taken out of context. Criticising shittilly written women in fiction is one thing, complaining about gender differences in empirical data is another."
