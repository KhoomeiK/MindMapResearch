NYYankees,ffqu55g,t3_eunwpf,1580143700.0,"On one level, these comparisons are fair. But on another, completely wrong.

Kobe is among the greatest in NBA history. I’m not a hardcore NBA fan, but I think it’s not unreasonable to say he’s among the top 10 players in league history.

Now, I love Derek Jeter. I was 14 when the Yankees won the ‘96 series, so I have many fond memories of him. But if you think he’s among the top 10 baseball players ever, you’re insane. Even just looking at Yankee greats, he’s probably at best fourth behind DiMaggio, Mantle, and Berra (maybe fifth behind Whitey Ford).

I really hate it when everything stops for like five minutes and I especially hate it when the other team congratulates a player for breaking a record while playing against them. When Mark McGwire hit no. 62 against the Cubs and he got handshakes and butt slaps and hugs from the players, and then Sammy Sosa ran all the way in from the outfield to hug his buddy, all I could think was (1) you’re in a pennant race and just gave up a homer, so maybe be upset about that for a second and (b) how insulting is all that to Steve Traschel, YOUR TEAMMATE who just gave up the homer?
