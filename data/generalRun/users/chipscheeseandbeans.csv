& I can’t even tell my husband yet because he’s travelling abroad for work until Saturday and it’s night where he is right now. Can I really wait 3 whole days to tell him in person? I want to but I bet he’ll ask me if I’ve tested and I don’t want to lie... hmm..."

TryingForABaby,fem9ox5,t3_epsqa9,1579244994.0,Right before I found out I was pregnant I was totally convinced I was about to have the period from hell - my PMS symptoms were intense. I should have realised but after 5 failed cycles I’d stopped expecting it and was just waiting for my period so I could have a bottle of wine haha

IDontWorkHereLady,fej5a7x,t1_feia0h1,1579157454.0,"Its obvious from that statement that he couldn’t place where he knew OP from. If he’s spent all of his life socialising with 9-5ers then he was probably just confused about why one of his friends was working on a Sunday. Also older people often have problems filtering their opinions. 

I reckon we can all think of an example for our own social group, eg. All of my friends have successful careers, so if I bumped into someone that I couldn’t place I might assume we’d met at a dinner party, & then I might be shocked if they mentioned they earned minimum wage. I wouldn’t say it aloud, but I might if I was older (or drunk haha)."

TryingForABaby,fdq7038,t3_emmguj,1578657571.0,I’m usually the person touting the influence of nature over nurture... but in this case I think it’s the latter. Look at the timing - you just turned 30 and you just got married. We are socialised all our lives to associate those 2 things with having a baby. If this was due to biology then you’d have had these strong urges since puberty.

toddlers,fdokpzb,t1_fdojg7u,1578607106.0,Part of loving someone is accepting their flaws. No one is “perfect” and believing in perfection is to set yourself up for disappointment.
toddlers,fdokhrb,t1_fdofp21,1578606972.0,"I’m the same as you. Sometimes when my husband says cheesy things like in the OP it makes me a little sad because even though I know he’s just being nice, he’s also lying. 

Just be honest with your wife. My husband knows that my rare compliments are always genuine and I think they have far more impact that way!"
