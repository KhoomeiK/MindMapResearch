badassanimals,ffgge0m,t1_ffgcqzk,1579905633.0,"Kinda, this *Borealopelta* was naturally mummified 110–112 million years ago, then its mummified remains were fossilized & then we're discovered back in 2011, studied & prepared for 5 years & finally put up for display in 2017."
badassanimals,ffgfitc,t1_ffg2s0w,1579905085.0,"Study of the pigments present in the remnants of skin and scales suggest that *Borealopelta* might have had a reddish-brown coloration in life, with a countershaded pattern possibly used for camouflage.

This reminds me of a relative of mine that had a Tom turkey that was quite protective of some chickens, it was sorta like a one-sided harem.

simpsonsdidit,fep0bbs,t3_eq63or,1579309286.0,"I'm no expert, but apparently the story behind this photo is that  this kid was with Orthodox Jewish family members at a synagogue during a Purim festival. The Jewish holiday of Purim celebrates the Jews' salvation from genocide in ancient Persia.

It's not uncommon to see people, especially kids dressing up in clown costumes & other colourful getups, alongside people wearing traditional religious clothing  at Purim festivals."

Couldn't go work this morning because of this, I even woke up at 6 because of my early shift. Oh well, at least I can catch up on some reading & my shows."
Dinosaurs,feo8le9,t1_fenj7id,1579296614.0,"I remember reading some tweets from museum staff members on Twitter a while back that the museum sadly didn't have enough funds to get new Dino models, so they had to make do with ""refurbishing"" the raptor models.

At least the raptors were updated, the museum's poor *Triceratops* model is still stuck with its retro 50s look."
Dinosaurs,feo8b6d,t1_fenpvbb,1579296461.0,"I think that might have to do with their age, I believe they're from the 80s or 90s & have only been recently refurbished

Maybe their rubbery skin was rotting away at some point, hence the ""squishy"" look."
Dinosaurs,feo7ais,t3_eq1b07,1579296090.0,"They look more like retro *Deinonychus*. Anyway, I remember reading some tweets from museum staff members on Twitter a while back that the museum sadly didn't have enough funds to get new Dino models, so they had to make do with ""refurbishing"" the raptor models.

I believe the museum's *Triceratops* model is still stuck with its retro 50s look with its bum in the air, croc-like osteoderms & tail dragging on the floor."

crashbandicoot,felmv5g,t3_eppd9m,1579225969.0,"Fun Fact: Carlos Alazraqui (The voice of Crocker) provided the voice & mocap for Crash himself in the **[infamous promotional trailer](https://youtu.be/r_TTrB0c3tc)** & **[E3 1997 trailer](https://youtu.be/fGe2PftP910)** for **Crash 2**.

Eyebleach,fed3ygb,t1_fecgx5v,1578997630.0,"First of all, It's a non-sexual strain from invasive farm animals. Second of all, ""poop slurping"" is surprisingly common in many herbivores from elephants to guinea pigs, this is how they inherit helpful gut bacteria."

Awwducational,fed3lb5,t1_fecnq16,1578997099.0,"This isn't exclusive to Koalas, many herbivorous mammals do this. Elephants, giant pandas & hippos are just some of the animals that also do this, this is how they inherit helpful gut bacteria when they're young. Same goes for many herbivores rodents.

Rabbits & their kin go the extra mile & can produce soft poop pellets that contain plant material that were improperly digested to later eat."
