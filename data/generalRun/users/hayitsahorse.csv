What I haven’t seen mentioned yet is if there are actual jobs easily available to you post schooling. And I know this is a finance sub so my apologies if this is off topic. For instance, at your current hospital, in the community you want to live in, are there for sure job opportunities? Are there jobs in your state? Are your wife and family flexible to move for a job and possibly at your wife’s employment expense. Is your wife’s career easily changed/moved? 

I think if you want to go back to school you should and you will earn a lot more! But make sure you will have career opportunities post school that fit with your families future goals."

dogs,ff34zb6,t1_ff2yu77,1579533803.0,If he is 6 months that would be a pretty steep increase in weight. At 6 months my guy was 19kg and I’m expecting maybe for him to hit 25kg as an adult.

k9sports,fe8scms,t3_eo3vxv,1578930127.0,Koopa finished his ITD! Woohoo. Now I’m debating what to start next. I’m thinking ADP’s new puppy friendly titles. Or going for his ATD. Any other online titling besides Cyber rally-o? Rally-o just seems super daunting to me.
dogs,fe8pm23,t3_eo4le6,1578928963.0,"Koopa earned his ITD! So pleased with the little guy. I think I might try out parkour titles next for him. ADP has a puppy stream they just developed so we could start. Any other online titles besides rally-o?

We also have been working a ton on barking at noises outside our hallway. I finally I decided I should train this instead of being lazy and just hoping it would disappear. I’m seeing huge progress within just this week. The overall amount, volume and intensity is way down. Hopefully Koopa feels less stressed and more happy about it too!"
dogs,fdwnvtd,t3_en7tuf,1578760655.0,"Koopa is almost 7 months old and both his brother and him are entering adolescence. It makes me feel slightly better that both of us are seeing similar behaviours in the pups, I guess I didn’t mess him up too much with what I did! He is extra snarky to dogs, barked at a child today and almost got into a fight over a stick. I think in general he is a pretty rude, insecure dog and now his puppy pass is long gone!  

In better news, we hadn’t worked on any tricks for over 3 weeks and yesterday decided to try and film some of our work towards our ITD. Welp, he nailed our routine and I think we may have everything! Fingers crossed!"
