depression,ff6zka7,t3_erzf1e,1579638125.0,Professional help might be good.
depression,ff6yyh3,t3_erzoom,1579637769.0,"it's fine,plus it helps a lil sometimes. when I was younger ,around 9 or so I wanted to die in war and my family would get compensated. I thought it might make them happier. Well, now I just want everyone to die. not just myself"
depression,fetlv4r,t3_eqcju4,1579376733.0,"First, my family isn't that close to me. I have 8 siblings but we ain't close. They think they know me. They didnt know even a bit about what I was hiding. When I told them about how I was beaten up, physically abused and sexually abused, and mentally pressured to not speak about it. My parents first said ""whY didnt you tell us?"" I told em, they didnt help me properly so I learned that it's pointless,  even my siblings who was older hit me when I ran crying to them begging to make my brother stop hitting me. Even if I describe a single event my parents say in disbelief that I might be remembering it wrong. they even go all the way and talk about their hardships. So ye, I never got to tell them everything...probably never will."
depression,feo2yke,t3_eq4w6h,1579294431.0,"professional help is always good, I think. I haven't got any so I cant really say. But people say its surefire way to help yourself.  I agree with you,life is like that. Each and every second , I used to try to make the most out of every moment when I was a teen. Some  times I miss that ""me"". Always trying to make the moment better. Jumping of a cliff every moment. Hoping for the best, doing my best, again and again. sometimes painful, sometimes unbearable. Sonetimes its soft..the little moments of happiness. It's not much but it kept me going. Just like you eventually I ran out, at least that's what I thought. But right now, I am here. In this moment, I am here and alive. Doesn't that mean I still have some fumes left in me? arent I still trying? Just maybe. The next moment will arrive as long as I am here. Things are starting to look very bad for me too actually. Similar to you, no best friend,  no soul mate...my own parents doesnt know how to talk to me(well they never knew how to show love and had a shit life so Inreturn I had shit stuffs too, cant blame em)compares me, insults me. The last time I cried ? I cant remember. Past hurts like a bitch, it won't go away. But a next moment can come, and it cant always be the very same. I can only hope and do my best for it to be a little better. Hopefully, just enough to make me last another moment. Again and again till better moments show up. Just maybe, good luck. Too lazy to do spelling and grammar check, and serious stuffs isn't my thing. Hope things get better for you and me."
depression,fenys30,t1_fenyprw,1579292768.0,you too!
depression,fenvxnr,t1_fenvp6s,1579291715.0,not the best way to make you understand what's happening...but professionals can get you a clearer answer.
depression,fenvp6s,t3_eq4z86,1579291637.0,"Get professional help, most peeps here are going through stuffs as well. Some maybe similar others may not. It's hard to understand what other feel in general, all feelings and depression alike. Got to say that you are an amazing person. Sticking to him and going far to help him. I hope both of you find happiness in near future. And again, get professional help. It's the most sure fire way of helping him. Good luck."
depression,fenu5li,t3_eq4zwp,1579290766.0,"it's good,  but not having depression doesnt mean that you cant be sad."
depression,fbvja5i,t3_eejns5,1577131604.0,"People who physically abuse seem to forget it I think, I have been  in 4 different schools, been bullied and abused in school and at home. My brother is the main cause. He doesnt remember apparently. I was sexually abused as well. The Mental pressure eventually made me share a lil. My ex left me for another guy , I gave life one more push before I decided to give up and hope to die.With withered will,I tried to study and make my parent proud. But it only made me question about if this is really what I want. I haven't lived that long, but it feels like a longtime has passed. I have 3 elder brother and 5 elder sisters, but they dont feel close,let alone like family. I have mother and a father, love is something I haven't learned yet. Let alone love...I dont even feel attached to them.  people didnt help me when I asked em. My own family didnt help, no one helped. Alone ,I was born into this world. And I guess I will be leaving that way. I do things ""poorly"" hoping to shorten this life span. Looking back to the naive self who worked hard. Sometimes I feel glad that my former self cant see the pathetic me. All wounds have healed, but did they really?"
