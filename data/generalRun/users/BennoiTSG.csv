AskReddit,ffad38z,t3_esfu3p,1579732704.0,"Instagram started getting really big when I was in sixth grade so I downloaded it like all of my peers.  We were in grade six so everything we posted was really cringey, but my account was particularly bad. As time went on people deleted their old pictures or even made new accounts, but unfortunately my account lives on to this day since I couldn’t remember my password. It isn’t private so anyone can just go and see it. Some of the shit on there is extremely embarrassing and every now and then someone who knew me at the time will bring it up and show people who don’t know about it. I had this account six years ago and I still get chirped about it on a consistent basis."
