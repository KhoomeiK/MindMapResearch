To be real - your best guidelines are going to come from places like nutritionfacts.org and your meal plans and recipes can come from forksoverknives.com.

great recipe sites i love:
shaneandsimple.com (this is by far the healthiest of these)
fatfreevegan.com (watch for extra sugar tho)
minimalistbaker.com (but modify for fat and sugar, IMO)
and also Derek Simnett on Youtube. 

i also think you can benefit from looking up the Engine 2 Diet! Both they and Forks Over Knives have free meal plans and apps.

science,ff6fryq,t1_ff6aejb,1579626243.0,"I strongly suggest a diet made up of mostly plants and low in salt, added sugar, refined grains, and saturated fat. This means in practice: cook without butter (I actually cook without oil, too), avoid eggs, dairy, and animal products as much as you can, look for food items with low sodium and little to no added sugar. Most packaged foods have a lot of both, so learning to do a bit of cooking on your own helps - as long as you are not pouring cheese, salt, and sugar on everything, too. 

I lost 70 lbs over about 18 months eating a whole food plant based diet. You do not have to go to that extreme, but the principles are sound and can be applied to any diet. Avoiding excess salt, refined sugar and flour, and saturated fat will take you a hell of a long way.

Example: 2300 mg max salt intake a day is what you should aim for. One serving (a half cup) of fat free refried beans had between 380 and 540 mg of salt when I reviewed several brands the other day. That is fully around a quarter of your salt for the whole day! 1 half cup of fat free beans!! Look for low sodium canned beans and mash them yourself, and you likely cut that in half. One reason to avoid salty foods while cutting calories and trying to lose weight is that salty foods tend to be an appetite maximizer - that is, the more you eat, the more you want. Reducing salt had a huge impact for me in being able to eat less without being driven mad with cravings or white-knuckling it trying to eat exactly 12 crackers or whatever stupid serving size is on those Ritz boxes.

If you would like resources, I have some - they are all plant based, but again, you can apply the principles to any diet. I'm not pushing 100% plant based - my recommendations are in line with the US gov't MyPlate resources, so you may want to check that out. If you eat less processed food, more whole grains, more whole veg, less salt, less refined sugar, less saturated fat...you will find weight loss to be acheivable, because it will help you reduce your food intake to a level that will support a healthy weight forever. I wish you the very best. You can do it!"
loseit,ff3m9h9,t3_erekb7,1579544066.0,"I personally knew of one guy who lost a bunch of weight and if I was single I would have considered him as a potential mate only after the weightloss. I liked him personality wise before, but the weight was an issue both for attractiveness and for a perceived lack of self control (and this makes sense because it tracks with my own experiences to a large degree - that is, I judged him as I judged myself) whether it was objective for his experience or not. So post-weightloss i would have not held his former weight against him. To me he fought and won a hard battle and that is a plus. I guess I would think about the potential for regain and the history or possible unresolved problems that could resurface, but I would not treat him the same, for example, as a recovering addict or alcoholic - to me those are scarier and harder to overcome. (And I am not saying at all that I am right about this from a moral standpoint - this is just how I feel and I do not claim to have morally correct feelings. I have known too many addicts and alcoholics and recovery or not I feel I am safer alone).

From a different angle: I met my husband when I was smaller after having lost a lot of weight and then struggled for a while, then after we got married my eating habits and exercise habits changed and I gained it all back (this took years of ups and downs and the ups won over time as they often do when you struggle with eating). I had told him when we met about my weightloss and my loose skin and he had no issue with it. He said he was proud of me. But then, dun dun DUN, I gained it back. Should he have been concerned that this would happen? Yeah, maybe. So I really could not blame him if he had made a different choice when we first met. I have lost it all again and this time my whole lifestyle has transformed and we are still together. He still believes in me and is my most solid supporter even though my body has changed so much and certainly will change again in some way, weight related or not. I am 100% grateful for him and he has convinced me over and again what it means to love someone and be committed to them -- which in turn makes me want to keep my health commitments to us both.

This issue is so very complex - it gets right down to the very core of love, physical attraction, self-esteem, boundaries and relationship dynamics. I feel very conflicted in judging anyone for their feelings either for or against becsuse I see both sides. I also believe that once you are in a relationship with someone you change the game because now you affect that person and they affect you - in a lot of ways you cannot even fathom what a person might be like while in a relationship with you versus before they met you. I was a hugely different person while in my former abusive relationship and that had an incredible effect on my weight and eating habits, too. 

I feel like this answer got a bit away from me; I hope it makes sense."

The ones that attach to the frame, if you get rear ended, may cause frame damage if the hit is just right - that is my first thought. 

I went with the factory part because a few months ago I was actually rear ended in my 19 Sport. I am supremely grateful for the way the bumper absorbed the entire impact. This outcome was on my mind when considering the risk of reduced crumple zone effectiveness. I just got a letter from my insurance company determining that there was zero reduction in my car's value after a certified repair. If I had had an aftermarket hitch installed on the frame, could the outcome have been different? Maybe. Only time will tell once we actually have some data on it from incidents. I was not willing to take the risk with that incident still fresh. 

Both cars behind me were totalled, both had irreparable radiators and were undriveable. The impact my bumper absorbed to have so little actual damage was a stark contrast to the other cars. I did not want to do anything to fuck up something that worked so obviously well for me."

IAmA,fehed9l,t1_fefmkg6,1579114809.0,"I eat a whole plant diet with some occasional foods higher in salt or sugar but not often enough to have a huge impact and I still get hungry. Beware of anyone telling you that you will suddenly gain a superhuman ability to fast and like it. My resistance to binge eating and my ability to put off eating for a few hours longer than I want has improved a lot - and is now what I would consider to be normal compared to when I ate a standard western diet. That is, i eat and feel satisfied, and then between 4-6 hours later, depending a lot on the volume and caloric value of what I ate before, as well as water and fiber content of that meal, I get hungry again - but not HANGRY. That is, I am reasonable about my hunger.

&#x200B;

What I no longer do: wake up ravenous at 3 AM, eat whole sleeves of Oreos without being able to stop myself, eat entire pizzas and then get hungry again for another meal within a few hours.

&#x200B;

A solid healthy diet should feed you and meet your energy and micronutrient needs and that is it - it should be able to allow you to adapt to whenever food is available to you. That is, if you are hungry but do not have access to food for a small amount of time, you should be able to weather that without feeling like garbage, and if food is available to you all the time, you shouldn't feel weird urges to eat it above and beyond your energy needs. Period. That is optimal human diet behavior.

&#x200B;

What gets you there? A diet high in fiber that triggers the release of satiety hormones and low in fat. What foods are like that? Plants. Not dairy, not eggs, not meat. That being said, there is no demonstrable difference in lifespan (in studied populations) between those eating a 100% plant diet and a 95% plant diet. My personal recommendation for avoiding side effects of being too hungry is to ensure you are getting enough fiber and water early in the day. Oats, beans, cruciferous veggies, hulled (not pearled) barley, steamed potatoes (higher water content than roasted), all would fit the bill as things you can build your fiber-rich diet around."

ADHD,feaco6o,t1_fe6klc1,1578947059.0,"I just did a thought experiment on this and realized:

I went all the way with you on the sandwich decision making process and added:
Should I toast the bread? Use a spoon or a knife in the jelly (and I 100% never do this the same way, and I think every time about getting jelly in the peanut butter and how best to avoid that, should i do two spoons), a plate or a paper towel or nothing, peanut butter on both slices or just one, etc. 

And sometimes, like half the time: I skip the hard stuff and do it all without thinking and then have to do it all twice or more: I store my bread in the fridge, so I get it out to toast it and close the door, then open it again to find the jelly when I remember I need jelly (ooh, and I repeat this when things have to get put away, and I sometimes reverse the order of getting things), and I'll have the bread toasted and have no plate OR paper towel so then I have to grab that or I just put the slices on the counter (but ew).

My best analogy is that my thoughts, or for example, the steps to accomplish something, are laid out like cookies on a cookie sheet - all equal sized, in no order. My mind doesn't serve up things like ""do this first"" or "" accomplish this no matter what because it's the most important"" without an incredible effort. It's all just there all together and in a way, that renders each cookie meaningless, even, in some cases, invisible. You have to decide which cookie to eat first, every time.

C25K,fe9ow1q,t1_fe8uzjy,1578940134.0,"7k is not a huge increase from 5, so if you are doing 5 comfortably at the end of the program, stretching to 7k will be a cool challenge. You can walk it or do intervals if you get tired,  and pacing will matter a lot - do not overdo it. People always always go faster than they intend on race day and it sometimes tanks the overall experience. 

My cred and how I did it: completed Nike Run Club 5k training in February 2019 with a 5k race.
After that, I signed up and ran a couple more 5ks and worked on building up to longer distances, including a 10k in June 2019. Eventually a 10 miler in Sept 2019, which I did not regret, but in hindsight was probably a bit aggressive for me.

My official goal after my March 5k was that I was going to try to establish a habit of running 2 5ks a week and a 4-5 mile run on Saturday, at whatever pace I could manage. Now I am training for a half marathon in April and will probably run a couple 10ks before that.

My running community jokes that you should always have a race planned. :)
I think you should run 5ks as often as you can afford to as ""fun runs"", a chance to join other runners, and as a way to gauge your progress. I personally think you should be running 5 miles at least once a week before you try a 10k, but if you can do 3 5ks a week then you could schedule a 10k 6-8 weeks out and train for it and you would be fine. It also just depends on your condition."

my favorite thing right now is to heat up beans (i toss in some stuff for flavor - fresh onion and garlic if I have time, powdered if I don't, plus sea salt to taste) and at the end wilt in some chopped kale (simmer for like 10 minutes on low stirring occasionally)

and I will add stuff like baked or steamed potatoes, some veg (easy stuff like brocolli or caulifower florets, sweet peppers, brussels sprouts - stuff you can get fresh and steam or roast or steam in the bag for quickness).

Or record every day in a weight smoothing app that gives an average or a trend if you can.

I took a step back from recording every little thing a few months ago, but I still made a commitment to myself that I would pay attention to trends and be mindful of what I'm doing - like if my once in a while treats started to happen every night, that sort of thing.
You can strike a balance - you are capable of learning the tools to direct your mind in a healthy way, but you have to trust that and not sabotage yourself ( like as soon as you stop tracking a deficit you binge or something...not helpful but kind of common).

you look great and you have done a great job so far. this is only the beginning of a new and happy life free from out of control eating."

xxfitness,fdizbs7,t3_elhyuh,1578454526.0,"I was nervous to try it, too, and I loved how the instructor told the class often what the modified moves were and reiterated that moving is the goal so you should do what you can that allows you to keep doing reps. She also reminded us often that we could drop the weights or add weights at any time and just go along with the movements. I still do modified box pushups on my knees, but I am getting better and I do not feel shamed at all for doing a modified exercise.
Good luck! Tell your instructor you are new and have a great time!!"

xxfitness,fcwaayl,t3_eikf5j,1578020773.0,I am training for a half and I have dropped down to two strength or mobility cross training sessions a week - I think you have to pick. My run goal is paramount and I am doing strength that will support and not compromise my runs. It's fine to do this - the pendulum will swing back around and you will be glad to have improved your time. It sucks to feel like a slowpoke when you know you could be faster. Best of luck!!

AND I was able to hold every pose AND have relatively decent posture and extension for maybe the first time ever. I'm finally making progress and seeing a strong and confident woman in the gym mirror.

Now if I could just listen closely enough to not have to crane my neck up at the tv to see which move they are doing next. The narration was so soft I could barely hear anything."
xxfitness,fcw0w6n,t3_ej3ryy,1578014574.0,"there is a huge blind spot in this love yourself, but don't change your body movement. And that is that internal work and external work are both needed and ok.

you did a bunch of emotional and mental work and that is good. now you can do some physical work, and that will also be good. Keep working to balance those and stay engaged, and you will keep becoming a more clear and stable you - capable of empathy, insight, and compassion as well as pull ups, box jumps, and sprints.

I feel that this is not something we should count on as protection from fires, but the people around me are convinced this could never happen to us. I'm so glad to hear that it stopped the fire on its own for now, but... there is no guarantee. I'm so saddened by the state of things in Australia right now.

ADHD,fcun207,t3_eiwyr6,1577984510.0,"You are not alone and I think about this a lot. It is actually one of the things that most makes me think something is truly wrong with me. But it feels normal - I love people, I experience tenderness, concern, affection, and grief. So I'm not anti-social. I just don't care to be involved in every moment, or know every detail, about all the people I care about. I figure they have their thing and I have mine, and I don't think about all the people I know all the time, or every day. The reason I feel that it is wrong is entirely from outside comparisons - people who call their mom every day or even once a week, for example, or text their friends and spouses constantly, etc. I compare myself to them and wonder why I don't feel compelled to do the same, if that makes me broken.
But since I don't feel negative things alongside it, and I still feel positively about those relationships and people just as they are, I think it must be ok. I do have some history of abuse so maybe that factors in, but I really do not think the two things are related. To me it is like those associations spark different feelings and desires - this thing we are talking about arises from a different source."
xxfitness,fclguiv,t1_fcl99hh,1577747475.0,"Yeah, I get it...i really don't actually want to make a scene, either, so just knowing what is going on beforehand is usually enough. I can feed myself!

xxfitness,fckybzo,t1_fcdbqr3,1577735813.0,"☹ so sorry that happened.

My holiday dinners were just me mostly bringing my own food and feeding myself. I just kind of gave up on it since my MIL is keto and no one has problems with her making everything keto by adding bacon and butter except me. But I don't eat dairy either and haven't for a year, so imagine my thoughts when she says ""but last year I made special stuffing for you - that had eggs in it and I thought that was ok on your diet?""

No. No. And you know what? It's fine...don't worry about making anything special for me. I will bring my own food. I'm not even upset anymore because I just accepted it and it is easier for everyone, but I did get these flashes where I felt sad that no one makes a good faith effort to understand what it means to not eat dairy. I keep having to explain it whenever we go out and it does feel a bit like....idk....like they don't care about me. It is one thing that they don't know my obscure hobbies, but this food thing is pretty prominent.

So. I feel for you."

I got an s-shaped trigger point tool from Amazon that is helping, and I have a trigger point ball I'm using that is also effective. The s-shaped tool is called the Backnobber II from Pressure Positive. The best advice so far is to work on the knot in short bursts and then be sure to stretch the area out along with gentle massage to ""remind"" the muscle how to be normal and stretchy. I also took ibuprofen to sleep and just get through the day.

My struggle is with healthy food gifts. My parents sent us a package of dried fruits and technically I am not against that - I just have to pace myself.  That is proving harder than I would like to admit, but I am doing ok with it. I may have to get rid of the rest if it starts to be a problem."

When I first lost weight in college, I lost my ""best"" friend. She suddenly got mean, telling me I was clingy and trying to edge in on her dream man (who we both crushed on together from afar). So to me, the fact that you two have supported each other through this and continue to love each other means that you have a good bond. Congrats, it is a rare and lovely thing.

AskReddit,fc6lz6o,t1_fc5j6hk,1577483722.0,"This goes for anything in the functional fitness areas too: boxes, steps, platforms, even bars and racks: they are not for resting your possessions, hanging your sweatshirt, propping your phone for a video, or whatever. Don't just sit on a balance or a medicine ball, either. Unless it looks like a regular chair, it is probably meant to use to workout, and if you aren't using it for working out, then you are wrong and you should stop.
