aww,fdcf9pp,t1_fdcf6fn,1578273460.0,Ok glad. But just so you know. You're the luckiest person alive for having the cutest cat ever seen.
aww,fdcf163,t3_ekjfcu,1578273296.0,Hiding the head like this is a serious indication of pain in the head. It might be a tumor. Hope I'm wrong.
memes,fdcewc1,t3_ekjf5u,1578273206.0,"Actual fact: Kite birds are the main and only reason (aside from wind) of fires in Australia. 
They look for a burned stick to throw on an insect-filled zone so they would come out to ground to be an easy target."
atheism,fd8o892,t1_fd6yrk7,1578220816.0,"I see what you're saying. It just widens the gap between believers and others. Which is not healthy for the society. However, i think it's more peaceful to live and let live. Having the ability to create a subreddit should not necessarily mean that I'm able to offense others believes/lives/etc... people need to get closer together from all sides and of all believes and what not. These are very hard times and it would be beneficial to all that we can sit in one table without grudges towards our believes. P.S. being an atheist is also a belief."
atheism,fd6x1vs,t1_fd6wtdr,1578196794.0,Agree with you 100% shout whatever you want. But have respect to religions.
atheism,fd6urlv,t3_ejxw30,1578195973.0,"I know it's a free speech and all. But you can't shout f islam whenever you feel like it. Im a muslim and I understand where you coming from. Sorry to hear that you didn't find place for islam in your heart and you have all right to do what you wish. But, respect all people and their choices. I rather have an intellectual atheist who argues me on a daily basis about religion and sometimes he beats me, others i beat him than a muslim who only is cause his family is and he was brought this way. You were given a brain to use. Half the verses on Quran ask the human to think. I hope you find peace in your life and you stop the hate on islam. Live and let live. <3"
