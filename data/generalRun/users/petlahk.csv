TrueAskReddit,felpfu0,t3_eppyxd,1579227734.0,"The way I see it, there are two possible outcomes to this, and we have a choice as a world-wide society which way we want to go. Before I really dig into it, I want to say that I'm a leftist, and you don't have to take me fully at face value, but I want you to please think about what I have to say because I have put a lot of thought into it. Climate change has destroyed a ""normal"" future for all of us, whether we admit it or not.

The way I see it, there are two ways this can play out, like, two main ways. I think that as with anything it might probably be in the middle, but there's the really awful way, and then the best possible way in my head. And I think both are possible, and both are on the cards given that we're at a massive turning point in human history right now, whether people admit it to themselves, or not.

The first one is the one you laid out. Human beings decide that the best option is to blindly fight each other, kill each other for resources. We continue to put our faith in corrupt institutions, governments, capitalism, etc. - all of which are the issues that have led us to this destroyed, polluted, and basically unlivable world today. Not addressing these problems can and will lead us to a dsytopian hellscape of one sort or another, whether it be monarchies, authoritarian regimes, and corrupt illusory ""democracies"", or blade-runner-esque corporate oligarchies with the rich in towers, and the poor in the polluted slums.

The second option is, we band together as human beings, embrace our differences, accept our needs, give up a number of luxuries for the continuing future of the earth, and live sustainably, together. This doesn't mean we have to give up luxuries entirely, it doesn't mean we have to give up on technology, or on our cultural identities. What it means is that we need to stop upholding corrupt, and exploitative institutions, and ALL live sustainably. What it means is fully accepting that human beings need healthcare, food, water, and fulfillment to survive AND BE HAPPY, and that these things are basic human rights not to be locked behind artificial fiscal/monetary paywalls that benefit the rich.

What it means is that we ALL practice communication on ALL levels. At the level of the self, at the level of the interpersonal, at the level of the village/tribe, and at the level of the cultural, and then finally, at the level of the worldwide. It means that we develop trust, and communication. We develop skills and practice them, and we use them for everyone's benefit. It means communulaism - which is where the word ""communism"" came from, although that word has been corrupted in the eyes of many, despite it's roots and ideals.

People practice skills, and people also allow people to do WHAT THEY WANT, to find FULFILLMENT in their own terms\*.

And what it means is that we ALL have to put in the effort to live sustainably. That means we stop mining, and destroying the enviornment through the sheer act of uprooting the ground. It means we practice only sustainable farming and agriculture. It means we stop exploiting each other, and other societies, and othering each-other. This doesn't mean anything so faulty as ""organic"" (whatever that means). What it means is using our accumulated knowledge of science to, on the small, AND global scale live sustain-ably. If that requires ethical GMOs, - WHICH IT DOES AND WILL - then so be it.

But it also means that we HAVE TO do away with our current institutions in all forms. Because it is our institutions that have brought us here. We have an opprotunity to overturn our institutions, and practice communication, community, and self-support on a global scale. Or, we can decide to uphold corrupt institutions until we all live in a dystopia, despite the writing on the wall, and the evidence of how we got here plain as day.

Those are your two outcomes. Sustainable, society (WHICH DOES NOT DICTATE FEWER PEOPLE), or literal death and suffering continuing under conservatism, capitalism, and liberalism, and neo-liberalism.

That's the options."

But I also feel the need to point out that there is a lot at stake here, and we can't afford to put it off thinking that it won't happen any longer.

Putting aside the argument that the far-right and trump have shown time and again they will continue to suprise even the most enlightened clairvoyant on these issues, I want to talk about what's at stake, particularly for my generation. ages 20-25.

Many of us informed folk in my generation also feel that a draft is highly unlikely, but it is a non-zero possibility given the egotistical mania and delusion involved in all levels and parties of the US government. I feel that it is necessary for each of us to reckon with what we are going to do should it happen, regardless of how low that chance may be.

It is also non-zero that Iran does have a nuke, or had the ability to quickly get a nuke should things devolve like they have, and I think it's almost certain that givwn the crisis Iran has taken steps to procure one. This is a matter of life or death for Iran, even if they can and will win in conventional and insurgent warfare against the US. So, all of humanity *is* on the line from a nuclear war angle, even if the fears of a WWIII are also slightly far-fetched.

The other thing at stake here is something that is not far-fetched at all. First, it isn't speculation that all wars in the middle east are about oil. But oil, or no, any war makes global warming worse, particularly a war that distracts the countries with the strongest moral imperatives to go green - the USA and others.

A war with Iran literally means the death of the human race due to crop failure due to global warming. Any large or medium war means this. Any war that isn't basically rebellion against current systems of power means this.

This war with Iran, really isn't just about war with Iran.

This war with Iran is a war against humanity in more ways than one, and this isn't some conspiracy theory i've laid out here.

This is my taking in what I know as best I can about the current state of world crises, and military technology, and the US and extrapolating.
