Stack the cans and tape the seams with a few rounds of metal tape, the kind you use on ducts, that thick shit that could cut you. Squirt some Ronsonol lighter fluid down the inside of the stack, then roll it around, sometimes old Gordy next door would wing it around some to air it out, he had a way with these things. Stuff a new fuzzy tennis ball down the canonâ€™s throat, then add fire to the small hole in the bottom can. Kaaawhupfff! Elon would be proud of how high that fucking tennis ball went.

Morganeisenberg,fc4ovv5,t1_fc2wfym,1577423230.0,"So hereâ€™s the verdict! We followed the recipe to a T this time, did everything but weigh ingredients including checking the oven temp again which was plus/minus 5F degrees. Couple things we took special note of were measuring overall and cooling the butter, also only chilling the dough for an hour (we wondered if the garage refrig was getting too cold in our winter climate). Anyhoo, dough seemed a bit more pliable when balling it up, I had high hopes. And.....first batch came out puffy and cakey in the center, much like the first go. So I added a titch more butter into the batter, that seemed to help but did not totally fix the problem. Then it dawned on me, we were taking the cookies off the pans pretty quickly to reuse the pans! So we left the last batch of three pans sit with cookies cooling, and whalaa, [flat chewy cookies](https://imgur.com/a/KYauoUP)! I would have never thought this to be the reason, thatâ€™s why you keep at it, right? Thanks again for all your help!"

Morganeisenberg,fc0vphi,t1_fc0kp4e,1577300904.0,"So Iâ€™m thinking one of two things, temp is one of them. We did chill the dough overnight, so it was cold when we balled it up. I thought the first batch was the result of going in cold, made sense. The oven temp was pretty solid, Iâ€™ve tested temp with calibrated thermometer. So we warmed the second batch, balled them and let them sit on the tray for a while, but those too did not spread. The second thing I thought of was the butter, we melted that in a microwave. It spattered badly at one point, we forgot to cover the bowl so we lost some there. But, I did replace the lost volume, but it was not a very precise measurement. So maybe that?  Thanks so much for your replies, esp on Christmas!"
