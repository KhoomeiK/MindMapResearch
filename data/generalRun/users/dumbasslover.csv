I'm not sure why your bf is dismissing what this guy did, maybe just bc he doesn't understand what it's like to be female and having to be so careful and aware around strange men"
relationship_advice,fgua3kh,t3_f0i9zc,1581115887.0,"Her ""apology"" can't even be called an apology, and to top it off she's still treating you like crap. Change your number and don't give it to her, and personally I would go low contact and maybe gray rock so if you change jobs she won't know where you work"

You take the cardboard roll out, and take the paper towel from the center and put it into the holder thing so you can pull the paper towels out from the bottom. But that doesn't look like it's what happened here lol"
relationship_advice,fgltwai,t3_ez9rkc,1580910826.0,I would not give her a large amount. You could buy her plane ticket and pay for any hotel or bus/taxi she would need to get home. It would still help her out a lot

relationships,fgiri3s,t3_eyqa9e,1580829282.0,"It sounds like hes trying to manipulate you by blaming you for his drug use and trying to guilt you. If you don't mind, what happened that hes saying you weren't

relationships,fg764a8,t3_exb0ya,1580584892.0,"I would break up with him. Even if it seems like he jokingly flirted with her, if hes telling her stuff like you're unattractive, abusive, and not paying rent, then hes probably trying to tell her hes not happy and may want a relationship with her, even if he is happy with you. He wants to seem available to her. More importantly, he has betrayed your trust and it's very difficult to build it back up again. If you continue this relationship, you will spend the entire time wondering ""what is he telling her about me"" and ""is he flirting with her again"". Best to move on"
