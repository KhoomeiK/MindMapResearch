You'd have to take the summers too. And they're pretty wild rn. Hail, fire, smoke, P2 masks.

But the wildlife is gorgeous. Adelaide is full of rainbow lorikeets, where I live its cockatoos, out in the outer suburbs, and the country towns, its kangaroos. Its really lovely in its prime."
australia,fffzdeo,t3_etf3mz,1579895115.0,"Hi, hey, Aussie here! I live in Melbourne. 
Probably easiest for me to list some pros and cons.

**Pros**:


- the wildlife is really cool. Like, rainbow lorikeets, kookaburras, kangaroos... a few months ago, I saw a lyre bird for the first time, *twice*, it was great.

- we don't have rabies here.

- public health care... sorta. Employers here don't usually offer health benefits because anything *necessary** is free on medicare. (*theres a big discussion about mental health atm, which is not free, or affordable to a lot of less-wealthy people.)

- if you look carefully at some older buildings where I live, you can see signs of the city when it was first built. Old cobbler signs, etc... I have even seen a sign for a business that I had to look up the purpose of, because it was so old. 

- We have large spaces where there no people, except the highway passing through. I really like cross-country drives because of the sections where there's nothing. It's so peaceful. Then, 2-3 hours later, when you're hungry, there's a small country town where nobody bothers you.

**Cons**:


- summer. Summer is hot. Even if you've experienced 45+°C (113+°F) my American friends tell me it's awful here in summer. A lot of older, cheaper rental properties don't have any real way to combat the heat, in my experience, so there's a few months of just sweat and fatigue and exhaustion. 

- winter. Winter here, unless you specifically live within 5-10km of a ski resort, where it's snow, winter is just buckets of water falling from the sky, wind beating your face, and sometimes hail. Recently very large hailstones. In summer. That's a separate issue.

- income vs cost of living. This varies from state to state, etc, and I'm not sure the standard pay for your field, but my research into welfare and blue-collar incomes in the US vs here is that they're pretty similar incomes. *Unfortunately*, though, a lot of stuff here is more expensive. I can go into better detail on specific things, like comparing the cost of petrol, etc, here. (Also remember that health insurance is on the individual. I pay over $360 a month for health insurance.)

If you want me to go into detail about anything, just ask."

So, I told you I have good news to share, and now I'm super confident nothing bad will happen to change things:
I got a job! I haven't been officially employed since 2015, and this is the first time I've ever been full-time, or contract at all tbh. Now I have sick leave and personal leave, it's great!

I am now an apprentice Baker, and it's a really great job. Everything smells like fresh bread, I am good at what I do (if a little bit slow and overly cautious) and I have stable income. I'm so so happy.

The only concern I have is that, now that I don't have any benefits, there will be a 6ish week period where I will have no income as I'll be recovering from surgery and only able to do ""light duties"", which is physically impossible in a bakery, I'm pretty sure.

But my SO is sure we'll be alright, so I'm not going to dwell on it too much.
