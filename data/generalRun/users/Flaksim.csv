pics,ffezerf,t1_ffeysh0,1579871281.0,"Well, I live in the country with just about the highest taxes in the world, so that is not an issue atleast.

The problem is that the US just double taxes you on things like property and even your wage if your income goes above a certain level. It's a retarded system that they can only afford to keep in place because of the dominance of the US dollar in the international markets.

It also makes it much harder to get a loan over here or credit cards... Even a normal account! Most application forms have a question box that you have to tick if you're a U.S. Citizen, simply because most banks don't want to deal with the  IRS and their bullshit.

Currently the issue for me is that I have to file my taxes with the IRS every year, in addition to filing them in Belgium. The end result (presently) is that I owe no taxes to the IRS, but I have to fill everything out just the same.
I intend to get a house in the next two years however, and at that point they sure as shit would double tax me.
In addition, the fee to renounce your citizenship is about 2.5k I believe, AND they do a final run as a sort of ""exit tax"" to pay, valued at your property and the taxes you would owe if you sold it.

All in all, it brings me no benefits at all, and I don't even have voting rights in the US, as I never lived there. My Belgian passport is also just as useful to travel abroad than my American one, so I see absolutely no benefits to keeping it at this stage.

It's one of those things that seemed ""cool"" when I was a teenager, or something funny to put on a Tinder bio when you wanna look interesting ""Oh, you're an American Belgian? How does that work?""

Research has shown that the opinion of ""the common man"" doesn't mean jack shit, no matter who you elect to take the reigns of government.

Link to the study below, but here are some of the key findings:

 

* Compared to economic elites, average voters have a low to nonexistent influence on public policies. “Not only do ordinary citizens not have uniquely substantial power over policy decisions, they have little or no independent influence on policy at all,” the authors conclude.
* In cases where citizens obtained their desired policy outcome, it was in fact due to the influence of elites rather than the citizens themselves: “Ordinary citizens might often be observed to ‘win’ (that is, to get their preferred policy outcomes) even if they had no independent effect whatsoever on policy making, if elites (with whom they often agree) actually prevail.”
* Regardless of whether a small minority or a large majority of American citizens support a policy, the probability of policy change is nearly the same — approximately 30%.
* A proposed policy change with low support among economically elite Americans is adopted only about 18% of the time, while a proposed change with high support is adopted about 45% of the time.
* Interest groups have a substantial impact on public policy. When mass-based and business-oriented interest groups oppose a policy, the probability of its being enacted is only 16%, rising to 47% when they’re strongly favorable. “On the 1,357 proposed policy changes for which at least one interest group was coded as favoring or opposing change, in only 36% of the cases did most groups favor change, while in 55% of the cases most groups opposed change.”
* Overall, business-oriented groups have almost twice the influence of mass-based groups.
* While the popular belief is that professional associations and interest groups serve to aggregate and organize average citizens’ interests, the data do not support this. The preferences of average citizens are positively and highly correlated with the preferences of economic elites but not with those of interest groups. Except for labor unions and the AARP, interest groups do not tend to favor the same policies as average citizens. In fact, some groups’ positions are negatively correlated with the opinion of the average American, as in the case of gun owners.

The real issues in getting a thing like drone operated commercial aircraft or firebombing planes are not technical, they're regulatory.

EDIT: I turned out to be only partially correct: *""Predator pilots constantly update a set pattern for their drones, so that the plane will loiter in that pattern if it loses communication with its operator (which happens frequently). The drones are even programmed to automatically head toward home to reestablish contact if the link remains dead for too long.*

Recently , countries like China and Russia have started slowly stepping up their game to reduce the dominance of the dollar, in order to get around sanctions."

>The US is part of an extremely integral global economy, and as such can be dinged with sanctions from the international community if the court deems so. With the US imposing sanctions, it's hard to believe they aren't vulnerable themselves.

This is incorrect. The only reason the US can throw around sanctions left and right, is because the global economy uses the US dollar to do most of it's international transactions.it makes up 61% of all known central bank   foreign exchange reserves.Before the dollar, it was the british pound that held supremacy, before that , in the 18th centry, it was the dutch guilder.

But ever since WW2, it has been the US Dollar.More than one-third of the world's gross domestic product comes from countries that [peg](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-peg-to-the-dollar-3305925) their currencies to the dollar. That includes seven countries that have adopted the U.S. dollar as their own. Another 89 countries keep their currency in a tight trading range relative to the dollar.

Almost 40% of the world's debt is issued in dollars. As a result, foreign banks need a lot of dollars to conduct business.

The 1944 Bretton Woods agreement kickstarted the dollar into its current position. Before then, most countries were on the gold standard. Their governments promised to redeem their currencies for their value in [gold](https://www.thebalance.com/gold-and-the-economy-3305655) upon demand. The world's developed countries met at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to peg the exchange rate for all currencies to the U.S. dollar. At that time, the United States held the largest gold reserves. This agreement allowed other countries to back their currencies with dollars rather than gold.

By the early 1970s, countries began demanding gold for the dollars they held. They needed to combat inflation. Rather than allow Fort Knox to be depleted of all its reserves, President Nixon separated the dollar from gold. By that time, the dollar had already become the world's dominant reserve currency. But, unpegging the dollar from its value in gold created stagflation. That's a combination of inflation and stagnant growth.

Despite trillions of dollars in foreign debt and continuous large deficit spending, the United States still holds global trust and confidence of its ability to pay its obligations. For this reason, the U.S. dollar remains the strongest world currency. It may continue to be the top global currency in the years to come.

The dollar’s current number one status is under contention though. Countries such as China and Russia feel a new one world currency, one not backed by any one nation, is overdue in this increasingly integrated global economy.

So yeah, the US can be the bully because of the dollar, but it doesn't work that way the other way round.

The United States and it's citizens and politicians have long adhered to a form of ""American Exceptionalism"", AKA: **""Rules for Thee, but not for me!""**

&#x200B;

TLDR: The US can use sanctions purely because of the uniquely dominant position the US Dollar holds in the international monetary system. This is unlikely to change soon, the closest contenders to replace the dollar as the dominant reserve currency are the Euro and the Chinese Yen. But both are still leagues behind the dollar currently."

* CR is micromanaging everything, an ex modeler for example, stated he spent several months on just 3 assets, mostly because CR vetoed them in the last stage of production (even after previously OK'ing it) requiring the guy to start all over again.  
Similar comments are heard all over dissenters in the dev team: CR keeps glossing over tiny details, massively delaying progress.
* CiG keeps using ""buzzword"" like ""SSOCS"" to make it sound like they're doing something revolutionary new tech wise, when the ""tech"" itself already exists, and they just need to make it anew to work within Cryengine. Not a good sign.
* They keep trying to ""reinvent the wheel"", like how they are actually simulating eye vision in first person instead of some static camera angle. Sure, it's a completely new way of doing things, but it needlessly overcomplicates things when there is no reason for it.  
In short, all too often they're trying to do something in a new way for the sake of doing things differently, not more effectively.
* Their own roadmaps never approach reality, they do not miss (their own) deadlines by just a few days or weeks, but months and years at a time.
* Every other ""major"" patch (the .1 patches) the same slew of bugs and glitches keeps showing up, even if they fixed it the patch before that. Something like that reeks of bandaid fixes, which is not something you want to be doing in your alpha, when the software should still be relatively streamlined.
* Progress on ship production specifically is not linear, they finish one or two hyped ships per year, but others remain on the backburner for several years with no progress. Instead they suddenly release a so called ""ready to fly"" ship out of nowhere... That is obviously a means to draw in more money first and foremost, at this stage in the game, with the (proposed) lineup of vessels already, there is no need whatsoever to keep inventing new ones to add to the already expansive list.... Unless you desperately want to rake in more cash.
* According to their financials (which they intentionally try to keep as vague as possible) they are running out of money, and actually ran out of money already. They managed to secure a line of funding from an external investor however (Calder:  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattperez/2018/12/20/billionaire-clive-calder-and-son-invest-46-million-in-studio-behind-crowdfunded-game-star-citizen/#793c3f7f1aad](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattperez/2018/12/20/billionaire-clive-calder-and-son-invest-46-million-in-studio-behind-crowdfunded-game-star-citizen/#793c3f7f1aad) )  
Ostensibly to provide a marketing budget for SQ42, but in reality it seems to have been used for everything including salaries.
* Despite their (apparently) precariously financials, they apparently still have money to burn on this:  [https://cloudimperiumgames.com/jobs/uk/barista-wilmslow](https://cloudimperiumgames.com/jobs/uk/barista-wilmslow). Hardly their ""core"" business...
* The ""main"" subreddit downvotes anyone who points out even one of the above points into oblivion. Which creates a situation where it turns into ""blind optimism"". Which can be seen as validation by CiG.
* Due to the very vocal and upbeat ""core"" they have in the backer community, there isn't even constructive criticism being given.

The above list is by no means complete, just a quick sum up of some points that can be seen as ""red flags""."
starcitizen_refunds,feda64e,t1_fc7gl6c,1579005374.0,"Hamill is actually a pretty good actor, and an outstanding voice actor. The way they handled his character in the new trilogy was terrible, but the way he played his character was (in my opinion) great, and really showed how he has grown into a decent actor since the first trilogy.

Liam Cunningham would've been great... Had they released SQ42 in the midst of the GoT hype, but that ship has sailed aswell."
