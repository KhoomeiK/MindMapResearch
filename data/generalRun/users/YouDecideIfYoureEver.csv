UNC,ffjksdo,t3_etzmw7,1580000499.0,I think so. Notifications for status regarding university scholarships don’t come out for a few weeks though. So you could be being considered for one still but you won’t know unless you get finalist status and they tell you.
TooAfraidToAsk,ffja1hj,t3_etxrt9,1579993936.0,"Idk about that specifically, but you could always do men specific things like donating men’s clothing.

Sorry if that’s not helpful."
UNC,ffiycqf,t3_etij4m,1579985739.0,Uh oh dude. Better hope the dude from the bathroom post doesn’t see this.
UNC,ffi09y8,t1_ffgs0pj,1579961110.0,"No, read carefully. OP still has to apply for that program. However for the class of 2022 the WL acceptance rate was ~0.95% so yeah it’s still the better option."
UNC,ffhzx2h,t3_ethdma,1579960759.0,"Two years ago, 22 students were accepted off of the 2,300 person waitlist. Now while I don’t know how that may have changed with the new policy of waitlisting instead of deferring that was introduced last year, I doubt its much different now. 

So you’ve been given the option for deferred admission or black hole-ing your chances. This seems like a new program so nobody here can give you much information. 

I know a similar program exists at Cornell where students are given spring admission and they study at a different school for the first semester, so you could try looking on r/Cornell to see how people adjusted to starting school later than all of their peers since first semester is when a lot of people meet.

Typically schools that do this do it for students who were typically below the school’s standards number wise (SAT/GPA) but who otherwise have a compelling application. Deferring admission allows the school to not have to report the numbers for those students.

Edit: actually it seems like you have to apply for that program. DO IT. No way that program would have an acceptance rate worse than the 0.95% off of the waitlist. Even if you don’t end up going, better to have that option."

UNC,ff8evxn,t1_ff8elif,1579675517.0,Lol yeah on drunken Friday nights for sure. But I need some grilled for the week :/
college,ff449kd,t1_ff2uz7e,1579555204.0,Thanks man. I really hope so too.
AskMen,ff2fuie,t3_er9hsx,1579504350.0,I prefer across but diagonal.
college,ff2bgp5,t1_ff2b9xa,1579499641.0,"Technically “business administration” but I’ll be concentrating in finance. My goal is to work in iBanking. So a lot of it is corp fin, valuation, and modeling course work. I don’t get to take those courses for a while, so I’ve been doing a lot of studying on my own. My school has solid banking OCR."
college,ff2b0u2,t1_ff2aigg,1579499210.0,"Networking is really your only option. Since you mentioned you went to a non target, you’ll need to get a resume push. Have you gone on Wall Street Oasis? It has a lot of amazing networking tips. It can be a little toxic though. 

So since I’m only a freshman, my goal is to just build relationships at the moment so I’m not entirely sure how you’d go about this, but I think you’ll need to be a bit direct. I would definitely start with your frat buddies. Everybody I know who got internships early on in college when they had no experience got it through networking. 

Now as an absolute last resort, and I mean these last two are an **absolute** last resort:

I’ve heard of some people just going to law school but I saw that you mentioned you have $70k debt so that may not be a good idea. This doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a job though. 

If you’re willing to put in the significant time and monetary investment, and you’re good at STEM, you could try taking community college courses then spam apply to med schools. If you perform decently, you’ll get a job. There’s a thing about med school that really provides amazing job security. It’s called the match system. Basically everyone but the absolute worst performers will be employed."
college,ff2agjc,t1_ff2a37d,1579498671.0,"Yeah definitely do that. No way they’d take someone with no experience who applied on a portal, but if a buddy can vouch for you, your chances will go up substantially.  

I’m positioning myself for iBanking, and everybody tells me that networking is the only way to get an internship offer. So I’ve been pushing with that.

Don’t give up man. You can get a thousand NOs but all you need is one Yes."
college,ff29ypl,t1_ff29fh7,1579498208.0,Are you applying through portals? I’ve been told those can be black holes. You should get ahold of your alumni database and just mass cold email.

UNC,fek4s91,t1_fek4fa3,1579192602.0,If you wouldn’t do it if you were in their position then why are you salty about not having that “experience?”
UNC,fek239d,t1_fek1fkf,1579190963.0,"I think the issue is that you believe reddit should be used for belittling people you admit you’re jealous of but don’t have the courage to do so irl. 

All I’m saying, stop being such a jerk. I hope one day you can learn to accept your hard work with due pride while not letting it get to your head to the point to disparage others who didn’t do the same as you did. 

The fact that you admit you’re jealous shows that if you were in their position, you’d do the same."
UNC,fek0a6m,t1_fek017s,1579189848.0,Friends are different lmao. You have no idea who this kid is. How about you go stand outside of Granville and call out all the kids wearing more than $200 in clothing?
UNC,fejx041,t1_fejvn7m,1579187782.0,"Man, that much pent up resentment and hatred can’t possibly be good for your health. And by apartments I’m talking Lark and Carolina Square where most off campus students I know live. What other “rich people dorms” exist besides Granville? Granville is privately owned anyway.

I’m sure most people here have an opinion on this topic, but when they see a post they don’t like, they do the sensible thing and just downvote and move on. 

What they spend their money on does not affect you at all. Thus, while you have the right to voice your opinion, you have absolutely no moral right to just belittle and berate people, calling them pathetic for simply looking seeking a legitimate service. I bet you wouldn’t dare say these things in person. 

You’re pathetic for letting your insecurities transform into such intense hatefulness, resentment, and bitter rage."
UNC,fejqzgm,t1_fei5yy5,1579183657.0,"Why the hell does it matter to you if people live in apartments? You seem to really be projecting your own problems into raging on other people. And if you’re receiving any financial aid, that’s probably coming partly from “daddy’s money” from the kids you hate.  So unless you’re covering your entire CoL and tuition, without any outside help whatsoever, including need based aid, then you have no right to shit on others like this.

Welcome to reality my guy."
