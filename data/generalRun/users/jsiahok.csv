depression,ffjyrri,t3_eu1mmk,1580010670.0,"If you really care and don’t want don’t to lose him you will just have to stick around and keep trying to let him know you care. He probably doesn’t trust anyone.
Me might be extremely slow to trust anyone and if your not willing to stick it out for him don’t pretend to be able to."
depression,ffjx5vl,t3_eu1anz,1580009391.0,"I wish I knew. Frankly I don’t think the is a definitive answer. I think you have to find your own purpose and pursue it. Don’t be afraid to reach out and get help, in whatever way you feel comfortable doing so."
depression,ffjwepb,t1_ffjwavw,1580008789.0,I’m sorry. I don’t know exactly how you feel so it’s hard to help. But I’m here for you.
depression,ffjw6ds,t1_ffjvtqz,1580008606.0,I did too man. I can’t tell you how much I loved the girl I once had. We use to meet at this place in the woods and just hold each other. I felt like I could just stare into her eyes for the rest of my life and be happy. One day she told me that she didn’t think it would work out and abruptly ended our relationship and it hurt more than anything I had ever been through and somehow I got over it. You can too. I wholeheartedly believe that
depression,ffjvsa4,t3_eu0zih,1580008308.0,"Girls aren’t everything. Having someone who loves you isn’t everything. You can be happy without it, it is possible. It might feel like it isn’t because I’ve been there but it really is."
depression,ffjvkjw,t3_eu121a,1580008143.0,Thank you. The same to you
depression,ffjvj6t,t3_eu12vd,1580008113.0,Life isn’t that easy. Life is hard. I don’t know why it is but it is. Just know that there are a ton of people who feel the same way as you like me.
depression,ffjvcdk,t3_eu13on,1580007966.0,I know how you feel. Like there is no one out there who would ever love you for who you are. Maybe there isn’t but who cares. You are still worth something. You just have to find out what it is. That’s the biggest challenge we all face but it’s out there.
depression,ffjtakj,t3_eu0lcp,1580006355.0,"Life frankly just sucks man. You won’t get that perfect love that you thought could happen sometimes. You have to go above that, you have to be ok with the fact that it doesn’t always happen like that. For some people like you and I love isn’t in our destiny. Becoming okay with that is the key."
depression,ffjsw4x,t3_eu0o5i,1580006048.0,"You’re not worthless. Finding your purpose is tough, I haven’t even done it yet but I’m trying. Sometimes you have to make your own purpose."
depression,ffjsq0u,t3_eu0o87,1580005919.0,Nah bro I know what you mean. I’ve felt so disconnected from reality for a long time now. For me it was drugs that kinda put me in this state and even after I stopped using I still feel extremely disconnected and like I’m not even alive.
depression,ffjsinw,t3_eu0oj7,1580005763.0,"Please don’t. If not one else does know that I love and care about you. You have worth, you have a purpose. I don’t know what your going through but I’ve been to the point where I wanted to take my own life and all I can tell you is that it can get better."

depression,ff2qvvg,t3_era0ww,1579519987.0,Happened to me all the time. I got used to it after a while and 4 years flew by and I was out of high school. Now I have new problems but just saying all the problems you have centered around high school specifically aren’t going to last forever.

ShouldIbuythisgame,ff1byar,t3_er1929,1579477313.0,If you prefer Xbox absolutely. Teamkilling can be rough sometimes and sweaty assholes might kick you if you are the last one alive and either die or just don’t play how they want you to. When that doesn’t happen it’s a really fun game.

depression,ff17l0f,t3_er2ic6,1579476058.0,I used to do the same before I decided to let some of my closet friends know. They are no longer my friends. They called me manipulative and that I was just saying this stuff for attention and that it just came out of the blue. Sorry I got depression I guess. I hate them with a burning passion after being super sad about it for like 3 years.
