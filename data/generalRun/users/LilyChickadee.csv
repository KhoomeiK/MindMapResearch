bipolar,ff6ywvq,t3_erx4lf,1579637744.0,Look up R/CPTSD and read Pete Walker’s book from surviving to thriving. I have found that majority of my symptoms are from CPTSD rather than bipolar. It sucks to have both.
bipolar,ff6ynbw,t3_ery68t,1579637587.0,"He sounds like an asshole and you should dump him.

You also sound manipulative. Storming off saying you’re going to kill yourself and expecting him to beg you not to is manipulative. That is extreme manipulation and I would agree is emotional abuse.

You can’t get mad at him for not jumping every time you are at risk of doing something harmful. That is not HIS responsibility. It is 100% YOURS. No one else’s. 

I would get some serious therapy (maybe DBT) before getting into another relationship. I don’t want to downplay that he is an asshole, but you also have some serious problems. 

If you want a healthy relationship, you need to be able to take care of yourself. Our partners are there to help us, but not to keep us alive. That is up to you."

Yes he may be reaching out for attention. What else are you supposed to do when you are that depressed? Yet if this guy committed suicide, everyone would say “why didn’t he reach out... we had no idea”.

And the callous calls for him to “get therapy.” Social support is almost as important as therapy for PTSD. In fact, having a strong social support system reduces the likelihood that you’ll even manifest PTSD. it’s that important. 

Not everyone is a social wizard and knows how to ask for help... he’s doing the best he can. Perhaps he’s a veteran who can’t stand leaving his house? Well never know, because we’ve only seen one plea from him for social connection. 

Fuck everyone that is making fun of this poor guy."

selfimprovement,ff41jmu,t1_ff41bb7,1579553526.0,"Usually these patterns of self talk come from somewhere. Has anyone in your life talked to you in that way, or at least expressed the sentiment to you that you are ungrateful?"
Christianity,ff404x9,t1_ff3ybit,1579552648.0,"While I believe religion is more pure when it is truly believed of as magic, as it was in the Middle Ages, I look to Jung to explain religion in a way that may make more sense metaphorically to those that don’t “feel” it the way I do. Although his work is often considered blasphemous to many Christians and it has been disputed whether Jung was Christian himself or not—I however, believe he was). 

He said, “since I knew from experience that God was not offended by blasphemy, that on the contrary, he could encourage it, because he wished to evoke not only man's bright and positive side but also his darkness and ungodliness, God in his omniscience arranged everything so that Adam and Eve would sin. God intended them to sin.""

In the same way the Tao teaches that you cannot have light without dark, Jung believed to be an entire self is to incorporate good and bad, both of which come from God.he believes God is completed by both evil and goodness. 

I think this is understood subconsciously by the more mystical side of Christianity. I believe Jung actually diluted the poetic beauty and depth of Christianity by stating these beliefs outright. But they do help put to words the powerful mystical experience of God, Christ, and religion to me. 

I would encourage you to read further. There is a lot of depth of religious experience that is completely disregarded by those who have not experienced it. And many forms of the Christianity of today are far more superficial and lack the depth that it can have."
Christianity,ff3xtoa,t1_ff3wdyf,1579551206.0,"I think it’s more that those things may have been necessary in human evolution, but we got to a point where our consciousness had the ability to be expanded upon—at which point Jesus was given to us. 

You have to agree, at least metaphorically, it’s a beautiful sentiment. Believers simply take that one step further and accept it as reality. 

There is much more depth to Christianity than you allow yourself to look for."
Christianity,ff3wrjt,t1_ff3viqq,1579550539.0,"I just find it really hypocritical that atheists take GREAT offense to Christian points of view, yet Christianity has to bend over backward to be accommodating to everyone. This isn’t even directed mainly at you, but at the moderators and Christianity as a whole. There is nothing wrong with having an identity and firmly defending that identity, which Christians seem to falter on. Perhaps because they feel the need to be more open in order to get followers/maintain their presence in a culture that has turned away from them. I think it’s cowardly to be honest. I am well read on many philosophies and religions, but why should we allow athiests to evangelize their ideas here when that is not respected on their end? Why do athiests get a “safe space” but Christians are seen as bigoted for wanting the same?

I don’t feel like what you are discussing is even really about Christianity, it’s essentially just saying why you think Christianity is wrong. Which is more about athiesm than it is Christianity. It’s like if I went to the atheist sub and said “God is great and you are putting yourself in jeopardy for not believing.” That would be downvoted to hell, but similar sentiment from the other side are welcomed here. 

I find it very interesting we have an atheist mod (at least last I remember), yet that would never happen on the atheist subreddit. 

I am radically left wing, but I’m inundated with wha feels like hate towards religion constantly. I wouldn’t mind having a safe space. I’m sure many agree, but it’s too politically incorrect for us to voice.

Or perhaps the Christians here find allowing atheists is another way of evangelizing and hoping the messages here will change their mind.   I find that far too calculating for my tastes."

CPTSD,ff3gc45,t3_er9s24,1579540464.0,"Especially socially. Like, I am just NOW learning to trust other people. I have gone through so many friendships where I cut people out at the first sign of danger. I was hyperactive to any kind of danger presented and cut out people that were good enough, but were of course human and made mistakes. I find reasons to cut out anyone once they begin to scare me. 

I am SO behind socially. I have a good career, have a good significant other, did well in school, but I am socially barren. Every social situation immediately triggers me into thinking I'm in danger, even frequently with my significant other."

&#x200B;

I wonder how much of it is ego. I was exposed to hell-fire and brimstone baptists as a child, so I tend to lean FAR the other way. I really dislike rock bands and powerpoints if you know what I mean. But perhaps that is keeping me from finding a good-enough church that has political views closer to mine."
simpleliving,ff0mg1x,t3_er2ez3,1579470243.0,"I'm going to go against the grain.

I suffer from several mental illnesses and it's hard for me to be social. I did suffer from some extreme jealousy from social media. I deleted all of them, except reddit, and haven't had them for years.

I actually preferred having them. It kept some social interaction between old friends. The jealousy often fueled me to want to be better. And I will admit something embarassing--I often went out and actually DID things for social media because my life was so boring otherwise. Or I would find beautiful things in my current life and social media made me have gratitude all of a sudden. Like ""Oh, I'm listening to records with my dog enjoying a glass of wine. This is a beautiful moment. I'm going to take a picture."" It just was a little thing that helped you understand when moments in your life had beauty. And it made you CREATE moments of beauty in your life.

I think, despite the jealousy, it was actually a plus. I have been thinking about getting at least instagram back. I've seen what Facebook has turned into and... never again will I go back to that due to the shitty adds."

It isn't until three years later that I did my own trauma work through books that I started to relate my responses to those that are typical to trauma.

My doctor explained what you just did, but it wasn't until three years later. That's three years wasted that I could've been doing the trauma work that has helped me infinitely times more than medicine (which I do think is helpful, just not NEAR as helpful).

CPTSD,fe5fa6x,t1_fe3nfig,1578868789.0,Yes but I think there’s a difference between it triggering bipolar vs finding a way to relearn the correct neural pathways. Being diagnosed bipolar takes away all agency and makes therapy very difficult as you feel there is no control over your brain.
CPTSD,fe5f38c,t1_fe4dhgi,1578868697.0,Thanks for your input. I wish therapists looked at trauma first. I had a severely traumatic childhood but I suppose psychiatrists can’t medicate that. Although I am planning on staying on my medication as a “cast” until I develop the needed coping skills.

CPTSD,fdrlipr,t1_fdrl7k2,1578686306.0,"That is true, but it is genetic. It has to be “triggered” which can be from a stressful event. Or that trigger could be drugs.

PsychMelee,fdkkgue,t3_elhuth,1578505476.0,"I think that is because depression and anxiety have become trendy and our society has made a sort of anti-placebo where people begin to genuinely have these reactions where they wouldn't have before. It's almost like depression and anxiety is TAUGHT to children. 

However, people who have severe mental illnesses like MDD, BD, Schizophrenia, etc--they do need medicine. I agree, most of these people do not have anything chemically wrong with their brains, but instead have not been able to cope with life in a mature way because they have never been taught to, and have probably been taught the opposite.

Despite the world being better in almost every way than it was 100 years ago, all the new generation can talk about is how it's ending--violence, death, ""wage slavery,"" global warming. These are real things, but humanity has overcome far worse, and yet people are hysterical in an ""end of the world"" way that rivals what extreme christians and cults talk about with a reckoning. I don't know why the culture has shifted so negatively but I think that is the real problem with the depression epidemic. Depression is being TAUGHT. Children are TAUGHT there is nothing they can do. There is a real sense of nihilism in the world--perhaps from the echo chambers of the internet? I don't know where it comes from.

I'm bipolar. Meds are (relatively) easy. Once I became stable enough, I now have to learn COPING SKILLS and that is hard work. I can't take meds and magically be better, I just become able to have the energy to actually do the work that therapy requires. Part of that is staying the hell away from negativity like regular news, most of reddit, and the countless depressing documentaries that are out there. Perhaps in the olden days, people were more content as they only saw their part of the world. With media now, you can dig into the most depraved and depressing parts of society and of the world in general. So even though, as a whole, the world is better in almost every way--we are exposed to the ugly far more than we ever were before."

You NEED to take care of yourself. Your mom is not your responsibility. Until she gets treatment I would cut her out. Completely.

I would also suggest learning more about CPTSD which you likely have from your childhood. Go to r/CPTSD and also check out Pete Walker especially “CPTSD: from surviving to thriving”

It’s time to take care of YOU and the awful childhood you’ve been through. I know your mom is sick but her refusing to take her meds is akin to an alcoholic not recognizing they have a problem. You have to let go and let her hit rock bottom if that takes.

I am bipolar as well and would give this advice to anyone in regards to me. I have made it very clear to my boyfriend that unless I am taking my medicine and being responsible for my own health, he has no responsibility to take care of me. You can help an alcoholic who doesn’t want help, a drug user, or someone mentally ill who refuses to take their meds. In my opinion, they should be viewed in the exact same way."

In fact, it's just another form of consumerism as once again, your entire life is based around how much money you are saving/accumulating and at what pace.

To me, simple living has nothing to do with money or lack of money. I save what is needed to retire and don't worry about the rest. I have learned to, instead of obsess about saving and being 'self sufficient,' to meditate on the fact that there is absolutely ZERO insurance that we will be. The economy, society, my health--all of those could fail. I do what I can in a reasonable way to buffer myself from that.

But I have found much more enjoyment in using my money to do things I like. I moved to CO and spent half my savings--it was worth it. I buy luxury items like nice candles and soaps. To me, living simple is paying attention to the small details in life and finding pleasure in them. For me, that's in candles, soap, good ingredients, and hiking gear.

I spent my 20s obsessed with wealth and protecting myself. Majority of the people doing that are just like I was, heavily focused on a neurotic obsession with what could happen. It's a hoarders mentality.

My new favorite quote is a chinese proverb. ""If you have two loaves of bread, sell one and buy a lily."" I think there is nothing more simple than that quote."

The funny thing about this “starfishing” is that even though I am obviously not enjoying it and I think it’s pretty apparent I’m having a flashback, I have never had a man stop. They’ve only asked if I’m okay at the end, and when I can’t talk they generally get pissed. It’s about their egos once again."
Jung,fc0z5rf,t1_fc0ys48,1577303668.0,"Witnessing psychosis first hand from my mother over 10 times since I've been a child, no, I don't believe it has anything to do with the subconscious. She is also very into Jung and often believes psychosis is  a link to the unconscious as well. In fact, I find Jung extremely dangerous for schiophrenics/mentally ill people in general because it feeds into their delusions more than anything else. What is ""subconscious"" about believing my dog is a reincarnation of a love affair from a married man in Egypt and claiming my father is part of an underground sex cult.

Even if you argue that that is somehow part of subconsciousness, it is not a healthy part and not one that is constructive in any way to individuation."

You absolutely should pity this person, it is ridiculous not to. Would you not pity someone who had cancer or diabetes or any other sort of disease? This person is not enlightened, they are ill. And people who think these sorts of people hold any sort of ""truth"" only feed their delusions and make them much more dangerous to themselves. Sorry, but your view is absolutely incorrect."
