A 'resistant planar' failure at a deeper depth is less likely to be triggered than a sudden planar or sudden collapse failure at a shallower depth, and if a run isn't very long or steep and has few trees or rocks to hit in a potential slide triggering an avalanche might not really be that big of a deal.

Even here in Canada a lot of people just write Americans off as idiots, because of how America behaves as a country."

TopMindsOfReddit,fc3lcpo,t1_fc39y3o,1577392419.0,"Ha, nice. There are definitely more restrictions on firearms here, to the point that it can certainly be annoying for a sport shooter, but personally I think its worth it. I don't think the new regulations they're pushing through make any sense mind you..."

TopMindsOfReddit,fc398ra,t1_fc2w317,1577384535.0,"We have those kind of laws here in Canada and let me tell ya, hell of a lot less people getting shot here. Carrying in public is also prohibited, which I'm happy with. You have to take a two day safety course before you can apply for a gun license here, but if you want to shoot it's not like it's a big deal. Unless you have a history of violence, then they won't give you a license and getting guns will be immensely more difficult."

A bartender? Everyone knows that a bartender isn't experienced or educated enough to have a job that's important. 

These people are scum, they have no values, no honesty, nothing but a drive for power and nothing will interfere with that."

If you're suggesting that nothing came of it, the journalist who exposed the papers did get murdered. Which is to say the message of 'if you shine a light on the deceit of the rich and powerful, you will pay for it with your life' was clearly sent to any other journalists who think that the regular folk should know how unjust the world is."
insanepeoplefacebook,fbzqmty,t1_fbznbgv,1577256642.0,"Today I saw a meme in a local fb group that said 'I wish Canadians hated meth dealers as much as they hate legal gun owners'.

Gun ownership is pretty widely supported in Canada, but the government is putting some new restrictions in so the gun community does what it does best and goes all in on victim bullshit. I like shooting and hunting and am supportive of our gun control here (although not supportive of the new regulations) but man these conservative whiners are just fuckin pathetic."
