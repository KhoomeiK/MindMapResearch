CasualConversation,fftaqrb,t1_fft8rpl,1580214689.0,"I'm not angmarsilar, but I think most folks gotta learn this on their own.  Now that you've been thru this, the warning signs in any new relationship will be clear to you.  You'll end things quickly with any future toxic folks.

skeptic,ffta4nl,t1_ffs8sxt,1580214050.0,"No, I'm just saying it's not a complete waste if time to debunk conspiracy theories, since some folks will be persuaded by evidence.  I don't claim to know how many, but I'm glad that some folks are able to learn."

AmItheAsshole,ffpereg,t1_ffp3h1t,1580093229.0,Thank you!  I've been reading all this and wondering if there isn't some type of mechanism for landlords who are losing money due to rent control.  I figured there had to be something!

unpopularopinion,ffpbz70,t1_ffogfia,1580091247.0,"Ethnicity exists.  That is different from race.  Race is a social construct.  There is no scientific basis for three distinct races of humanity, which is how race is defined.  That's just made up."

We went to one of those crazy houses that has every inch covered in lights, decorations all over the lawn, etc.  We pulled over to admire it, and my son said that it must be Santa's house.  I start to explain that santa lives in the North Pole, when he comes walking out the front door!  Yes, Santa walks out the door.  Well, some guy in full Santa Claus garb.  My husband and I just looked at each other in stunned silence.  Then I told my son he must be right after all."

I was her manager.  The company needed to cut some folks, following a merger.  Higher-ups had her on the cut list.  I think there was some unconscious bias involved, because she was a slower-moving middle-aged overweight black woman.  But I knew she was a good, steady worker and had more intelligence than many of the folks they were keeping.  And she had been with the company a long time.  I fought for her, and the higher ups didn't love that.  But I stuck with it anyway.

AskReddit,ffbv2y6,t1_ffbo051,1579783754.0,"Why do IT people think that everyone should know what they know?  If I look at any department in my organization, there are people who know their field way better than the rest of us.  And they don't know expect everyone to know their field and terminology.  But it always seems to be an issue in IT (well not always, but often).  I understand that it can be frustrating when the issue is really basic, but that happens to all of us.  I'm in HR and get plenty of questions about things people ""should know"".  But I understand that we all have different talents, IQs, EQs, experience levels, and comfort levels with things we don't understand.  I just calmly help people, even if they've asked the same question before."

It doesn't matter what exactly causes the extra medical costs, the fact is that people who drive motorcycles get injured often and society pays a price for that.
