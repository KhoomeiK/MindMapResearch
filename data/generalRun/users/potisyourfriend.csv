Have never owned a plane but I don’t buy that it costs 10-15k a year for a 172.  They’re literally one of the most available planes besides the 150 on the market and prices start pretty low for a low hour plane with plenty of time left before a MOH is due."

PUBGConsole,ff74oic,t1_ff6ill1,1579641058.0,You can live in BFE in the US and still have a low ping and also a low ping to the servers.  Gaming has been around for decades. I know when I was playing BF1942 on the PC back in 2002’ish with DSL I had a low ping <50ms and so did most of the people in the game.

PUBGConsole,feoga4i,t1_feljlow,1579299712.0,That’s complete bullshit.  They don’t fix issues even on the PC side before releasing it to the live servers.   If you’re going to use a test server then fix everything.  Then once you have then put it back on the test server for one week to see if it actually works.  Then you roll it on the Live server. Since companies now use its user base to test for issues rather than do it themselves they should have a game that runs damn near perfect.
PUBGConsole,femklk9,t3_epwtjo,1579260262.0,Have they removed the ability for the host to see where everyone is at once they die and tell their teammates where everyone is at?
