cats,ffmbj9d,t3_eu0sbe,1580051881.0,"My boy passed at 7 years old from fip. It was the hardest thing to watch him go through. I’m really sorry for your loss, but happy you decided to save another life. You’re a good hooman"

thumbcats,ffbk3yv,t3_esjs6j,1579769097.0,"My polydactyl has two nails coming out of one port on both front paws. It’s so cute but when he scratches, he latches right on. And trying to trim them in a pain in the butt."
TrueOffMyChest,ff6ronr,t1_ff61hj9,1579633469.0,"Mine is similar. It’s always the same dream but in a school, and the toilets are always flooding so I run around the school looking for a toilet that works. Once I find a working toilet I either wake up pissing myself or running to the bathroom lol. Thankfully haven’t had that dream in quite a few years though."

lastimages,fdc08mb,t1_fdbx5jx,1578264613.0,"I asked my mom (she worked with people who have disabilities for like 20 years) and she said most people with downs end up with heart problems and dementia, which heavily effects their life expectancy."
lastimages,fd6ohov,t3_ek1hd6,1578193804.0,"I’m so sorry for your loss. The same thing happened to my dad in 2010, I’m 23 now and the biggest challenge wasn’t puberty or dating or anything normal, it was trying to live life without my dad. I’m sure yours would be so proud of how far you’ve come. If you ever need to talk, send me a message."
cats,fcsw1rd,t3_eil0c1,1577926557.0,"I’m so sorry. The same thing happened to my cat in May 2019, sadly it ended up being lymphoma. A little different but was really hard to hear from the vet and watch him go through. I hope it’s just a treatable infection for your baby.  Lots of positive thoughts to you and your kitty"
cats,fcj4fdh,t1_fcesobc,1577677016.0,"Oh that’s awesome! My parents have been wanting to replace our cat trees so I’m gonna look into an olive wood tree, thanks for letting me know!

And thanks, he’s pretty cute. He’s a polydactyl (7 toes on each foot) and you can see one of his thumbs in this lol"
carbage,fcj2je7,t3_eh70u0,1577675674.0,Wtf was on the driver side floor? Dog vomit?
Pets,fciufb0,t1_fcisv0s,1577670064.0,"Even if I did have the money I wouldn’t have put him through chemo. But that’s my choice. He was very loved and well taken care of. All shots, vet appointments, etc. Sadly there are some things out of our control. 

But recommending a cheaper alternative to getting shots, spay/neutering, tests isn’t a bad thing?"
Pets,fcissuq,t1_fcirs8a,1577668958.0,Unexpected things happen. I didn’t know it was going to cost 1500$ when my cat was diagnosed with lymphoma. We had to take the route of comfort care because we couldn’t afford any other treatment.
Pets,fcipuyb,t3_ehaugg,1577666985.0,"Not that I find this expensive at all, but some people don’t always have the money. I’m not sure where you’re located but I’m in New York and we have a lot of services around here where you pay maybe 25-50$ to have a cat spayed/neutered, shots and fiv testing done. If you have these around you could you maybe recommend them to the people who don’t seem like they want to pay the amount you’re asking for? I do agree 100% with your post though. 

Also I’m not sure about dogs having the same services, I’ve only had primarily cats in my life but I’m sure there are some out there."
OCD,fc4p5vh,t3_eg3oi7,1577423489.0,My food... I can’t eat without inspecting every aspect of it in fear of bugs or green seasonings (basil or Oregano).
