But that doesn't fix the issue. Usually, I need to combine with medications and other lifestyle tweaks.

(edit) If you are addicted to caffeine or drink it every day, cutting it out cold turkey made me go to sleep on time, but also have a headache."

The best thing we can do is live our lives and follow what the CDC  says if it becomes an issue. Panicking could cause behavior that helps the virus spread."

Also, this might be a more urgent matter and help you get to see a psychiatrist sooner rather than later."
bipolar2,ffde5tp,t3_esxlxj,1579818984.0,"Hi! Welcome! I was diagnosed recently too and I'm 30, so I've been living with this illness for a while just thinking it was normal. 

In 2014 I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety. I'd have pretty intense anxiety attacks that would end up with me in the ER. I was put on Lexapro for around a year, which really helped my attacks, but lead to me losing interest in things that are important to me. Since I wasn't suicidal, I did not view this as depression. 

Last year I had what I now know to be an intense hypomanic episode. Not sleeping, not eating, while experiencing some intense paranoia. I started seeing stars in my vision, and I'm not sure it was from the stress of not sleeping and eating, or from the hypomania. It all culminated in an evening where I (stupidly) tried to chill myself out with a small amount of weed, and was stuck in a chair afraid for my life and the life of everyone around me. 

But I don't seek help and instead stabilized and was like ""well that was weird, lol"" 

Fast forward, I'm off the lexapro for a good two years, and I start a new, very stressful job. The attacks start up again in full force. So I decide that instead of just picking up medication from my general doctor, and dealing with my issues myself, I was going to combine medication with therapy. 

I told the therapist about my strange episode and she became concerned I might have bipolar 2. I got a second opinion from a psychiatrist, and now I have a team working to get me on meds that work, but I'm struggling with the process.

The people I'm closest to definitely did not agree with the diagnosis. I don't know if it's because of the stigma, or that I'm just super high functioning or what, but it came as a shock to them, even if I did get more than one opinion. 

For me, it really explains a lot of things. How I have five zillion creative hobbies, how I've practiced multiple religions, started multiple side-hustles, have times where I can't sleep or eat, where my focus is shot, and times where I'm so incredibly tired and don't want to do anything. At least now, I know what I'm fighting against and I have a support system that's aware and working on my mental stability!

Yay!"
