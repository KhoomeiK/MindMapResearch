My questions was more on a basis if there anything in the pipeline that would allow developers to for example receive certain percentage of GNT (through a smart contract?) spent by a customer if they provide a service/platform that would utilize Golem Network?

They received 2 million if I'm not mistaken, made a MVP, AION team was proudly taking pictures while playing games, they had their boots on a conferences and so on.. Two million users is not a joke. If only quarter of that would play on AION network that would be 500k new addresses, multiples of that daily transactions... Dude, that would be like as if   a whole population of Miami would use Velocia.

And they bailed because muh ICO money. 

Something just doesn't add up.. You can't just burn 2 million in a year while pretty much only thing you have to do is to connect two already working products with a help of  established team.  

Btw, Was this project open sourced? Is there any documentation about technology left for other game developers to use it?"
