GooglePixel,fgvar5t,t3_f0h7u4,1581142602.0,I like how it gives a haptic 'bump' at level. This feels nice to have.
pixelography,fgrndkj,t3_f00zys,1581051447.0,Hell YES! Sooo happy to see this! Northern Lights are my fave!

corgi,fgqm5x6,t3_ezmq5w,1581026850.0,Be sure to capture the special moment on video and share with us! Can't wait to see the reaction!
Insta360,fgo0wmb,t3_ezgpob,1580957243.0,"Just rinse it out well after use in salt water. I also spray some WD40 on a paper towel and wipe down the screw and segments. Collapse it, extend it... Hear or feel anything obstructing or grinding? Repeat the aboves steps until you don't. 

Be sure to rinse and clean the case, too."

GooglePixel,fg7sjhd,t3_ex7evp,1580600392.0,"I have both. I upgraded to the 4XL, but kept my 2XL (with modded APK) as well... Just added a data sim for it on Google Fi. I have a Moment lens set (Macro, Wide and Tele) and a Sirui 400mm lens that attach to the Moment cases on each. I'm finding that I'm only needing these lenses in a small bag, rather than carrying around my MFT camera and lenses. 

For the most part, the 4XL is my main beast, but the 2XL has so many things that I like about it that makes it my first try, especially when doing something new, like the 400mm lens. The 4XL can be a PITA due to the dual lenses... Zoom in past the 2x mark and 'boop!' it changes to the other sensor. Zoom back, and it stays in the other sensor. Swap the lens to the other sensor, zoom in, but it STAYS on the original sensor?! Granted, not all the time, and I know it has to do with sensed light to determine the swap, but a lens on one side blocks light, or when a lens gets added after, more light now comes in and it swaps after. Frustrating at times, so if I want 'no muss no fuss' I try it out with the 2XL first, since it only has one lens. 

Even with the futzing, I still love both phones and am really seeing myself leaving the DSLR or mirrorless rigs home more and more in the future."
Multicopter,fg7rgi0,t3_excl2t,1580599611.0,Kobe's pilot would agree.... If he could.
pixelography,fg2pskh,t3_ewhcof,1580451188.0,Nice shot! Sooo jealous!
pixelography,fg0ezj5,t3_ew11y6,1580406404.0,Nice!
longbeach,ffkhiyo,t1_ffkarfu,1580022854.0,"Then you will like Ficklewood! I bought some growlers to take home. Impressed that they do their ciders in the style/process of German White wine makers. The ciders are clean, crisp, and really damn good!"
MOMENT,ffkh5vj,t1_ffi1la1,1580022689.0,This! I do the exact same thing! I think the designers did that on purpose.
MOMENT,ffjavxa,t3_ettjv8,1579994456.0,"I have a 60mm, which I like because it has vignetting at 1x for artistic shots. As others have mentioned, zoom past the 2x point first, then attach. It can be fickle, so be patient. It uses the available light to determine which lens it needs after 2x, so having the lens on first can actually force it to jump sensors, since it's darkened from the attached lens. However, I've spent too long during between the 2 sensors while in a pitch-black area trying to get some Astrophotography shots, as well, so it's rather hit and miss. I keep my old Pixel 2 XL handy (w/moment case) if I get too fed up with lens/sensor futzing."
MOMENT,ffja8av,t3_etw9wb,1579994060.0,Nice work! Good use of timing video shots with the music. Also a good choice of music.
