I love how in 2 years that sentence will read:

""Cryptography has evolved from its first attempts (thousands years ago), through the first successful cryptographic algorithms for developers (like the now retired Argon2 and ChaCha20) to modern crypto algorithms (like SHA-4, BoobooCrypt3000 and DorrisBoris+++)""

if you're implementing security right this second, you had better be building it with planned obsolescence because the best practice implementation will change quicker than you can say 'maintenance'...

on the other hand, that rationale can be extended till nothing exists (do I even exist or am I just a construct of an idea that I exist? Does matter exist or is it just energy vibrating at a specific frequency?) including food but that doesn’t mean I will stop believing in eating 

So once again we have come to the conclusion that the difference between theory and practice is that in theory there is no difference and that Shakespear put it most succinctly when he remarked that he was “yet to meet a philosopher able to endure a toothache patiently”"
nihilism,fed9vp1,t1_feci809,1579005078.0,"All primate species live in groups. Just about all mammals live in groups (herds, prides, packs etc). Many birds and even some fish even do. Banding in groups genome is beneficial to survival even without ability to communicate abstract concepts 

What makes humans unique is abstract problem solving and communication.  one way to solve inter-group (as opposed to *intra*-group) conflicts and allow a network of tribes to cooperate is with commonly upheld rules which, in turn, form part of one ethos. And every ethos must be supported by a moral designation ie the rule that you cannot on whim take someone else’s coconut simply because they have set it aside and are not at present occupied with it is followed by the question why which is followed by an explanation of compassion, empathy and consideration towards the individual who made all the effort to obtain the coconut which makes it theirs (ownership- ethical) henceforth taking something belonging to someone else is bad (transgression-morality)

This is what gives humans edge over other species - ability to communicate and cooperate among what should be rivaling tribes into vast networks of cooperating tribes via a commonly shared set of moral laws 

Morality is inherently and uniquely human 

lowest commonly shared set of moral values across the species (and we seem to have settled on killing, stealing from, lying to and humiliating other humans) is outlawed and whether it is labeled “evil” has less to do with morality and more with efficiency of communication which rules must be upheld and when and how an individual is in violation of one"

the coolest thing about Flash was the authoring tool which allowed non-technical people to create and publish to the web animated and interactive experiences

the gripes about Flash player as a security problem and non-indexible-by-search-engines were valid but the gripes about Flash authoring tool being cumbersome for development were totally pointless 

then MS tried to marry the approach with XAML/Silverlight except the authoring tool UX was a complete abortion for non-technical people thereby missing the whole point of the authoring tool; so instead of putting peanut-butter into chocolate they did the complete inverse and introduced all the drawbacks of Flash without any of the benefits

tl;dr; what HTML5/canvas/SVG is lacking is a (good UX) authoring tool which will give the Flash-like authoring and publishing experience to non-technical people"
