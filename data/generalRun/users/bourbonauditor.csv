I also make my own eggnog around the Christmas holidays every year. At least once I will use that eggnog in making hot Grape Nuts. Having never tried eggnog on Trix I can’t honestly compare but I am sticking with Grape Nuts. Also, silly rabbit..."

cowboys,ffc0rcr,t1_ffc0ada,1579788594.0,"Thanks, I misread it as just INTs."
cowboys,ffby0kb,t1_ffb4nzc,1579786388.0,"He also has lost 56 fumbles so it is a lot closer than one might think. He gets into the HOF on the strength of the two SB wins and his last name. Take those away, a hard look at his career would lead a lot of people to leave him off the ballot more often than not."

cowboys,femnjs0,t3_epznk2,1579263772.0,Can’t tell from the article if they discussed the possibility of joining McCarthy’s staff or if it was simply the HC talking to a rostered player about his plans. I could see that if JG gets an OC position I could see that he might want to talk to 82 about a job
Wellthatsucks,feia3e5,t1_fehucn5,1579133684.0,That broadcast originated from France
cowboys,fehmjrh,t1_feh4krc,1579119576.0,"Plus he had the record for most consecutive games with a catch until Dennis Thurman laid him out with a brutal hit that I could hear through the TV. Holy fuck that was an awesome hit. https://youtu.be/s5piwM2ZhMA
Go to 1:06

Thurman’s Thieves was an awesome secondary that had Everson Walls, Michael Downs and Ron Fellows. 33 INTs one year."

cowboys,feh7qjr,t1_feethuh,1579110890.0,The play I really noticed him was on the Higgins reverse for a TD. Delpit gave up at the 30 and coasted after him all the way to the end zone. One play out of hundreds during his college career but the questions about effort got a little louder after that one. I do think he is a playmaker and the right coach might help with an attitude adjustment
cowboys,feh6ge8,t3_ep4qw9,1579110136.0,Drew Pearson and Darren Woodson need to be in. Hopefully this expanded class for the 100th year will mean some space for these guys on future ballots

Jimmy was so overcome with emotion and so was Troy as they showed him watching but the excitement of all the other guys on the show was just the best. They were all so jazzed as am I.  And as always, Jimmy is a class act to give credit to his assistants and players. I can’t wait to watch his speech at Canton. Congrats Jimmy, so well deserved."
