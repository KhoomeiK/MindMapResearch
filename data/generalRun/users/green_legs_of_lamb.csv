What they did say is that the strays there are very important to most of the Greeks/shop owners. They are more like street pets, many people have it as a part of their routine to set out food/water, and sometime take them to get vet care if needed. 


Strays possessing the souls of their dead relatives would be a strange belief for them to have as the Greeks are mostly Greek orthodox which heavily influences their culture."
