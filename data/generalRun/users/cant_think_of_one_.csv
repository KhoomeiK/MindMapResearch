Personally, I don't really regard most birds as capable of suffering much (they don't seem very smart), so I feel like I wouldn't worry that much, but I can't be sure as I haven't really seen this. Our old kitty used to only catch mice that I saw, and she killed them instantly. She was so fast that they were practically dead before you noticed them. She would parade their dead body around a bit, and gave us them occasionally, but didn't do the playing with them thing, at least that we ever saw.

I feel like it must be hard to match the satisfaction I imagine s cat gets from catching and killing a small animal. Cats that are indoor for life don't know what they are missing, and I think cats that are homeless and then become indoor kitties are probably happy with the trade-off (though of course they don't understand that there is a trade-off, or choosing), but I'm not sure how well kitties that switch from indoor-outdoor to indoor find it.

AskUK,feu3k6i,t1_feqyl6i,1579382764.0,"The current system, with tax credits and low minimum wage, effectively subsidises employing people at low wages and getting them off benefits. You can understand why this seems to be a good idea to the government - better to pay a little on top of a wage than benefits. It is bad policy in the long run now so think though. We are at a turning point, where we can start to reduce labour whole increasing quality of life still, thanks to robotics and machine learning. Subsidising low paid jobs creates a disincentive to do this though. This puts companies that may export technology to other countries at a disadvantage in the UK. Ultimately, to continue growing the economy, we need automation, so this is short sighted, harming growth in the long run, and making us dependant on foreign developed tech. What we should be doing is raising the minimum wage, and taxing higher earners (not the super rich, who can easily love their wealth, but the upper-middle class) more, so that we encourage automation, and have extra tax revenue to pay the extra benefits. There will be new jobs as a result of automation, tagging data for machine learning, for example, but these will likely be fewer in number than it replaces I think. For the first time, after centuries of labour saving technology, we may finally actually work less. The higher productivity will mean more tax revenue, despite fewer people in employment, so we can pay more benefits to more people, eventually implementing a universal basic income. 

The alternative is that automation pushes many unskilled workers out if the labour market and into unemployment anyway. Others are employed in basically pointless jobs that aren't worth doing at the wages they need to be paid to live independently of the state. Benefit costs rise and tax revenue falls. We end up with an increasingly polarised society, with few becoming richer and richer, and a contracting middle class working. Eventually inequality gets so bad that violence breaks out and there is eventually a revolution, implementing the previous scenario. It is possible though that the rich manage to hold off revolution, keeping the poor just rich enough to not be desparate enough, and stay in control in a dystopian unequal society. 

That is how I think it will play out, anyway (hopefully the first scenario)."

It is often considered to be a pretty dark song, but I started to find it a bit grating for the opposite reason - fundamentally the author is looking forward to dying because he expects to be reunited with his lost love, something that didn't fit with my highly depressed state at the time where I was suicidal because I couldn't bare the pain of existing any longer. I wasn't suicidal because I expected to wake up in some afterlife, that would have defeated the point.

They are, as a consequence, much more contemptible than the shit smearing animal that they resemble. I am not advocating that anyone kill them per se, but they do not deserve to live, or even to have the luxury of dying painlessly, IMHO. If I were in charge, people who play music loudly from speakers, who didn't have a good excuse (like being too stupid to understand that it was forbidden) would be transported to the middle of the Sahara and left there to die (or find a way to survive).

I may be biased because I am made unusually uncomfortable by music or loud speech around me. It makes it intolerable for me though. I have to either persuade them to turn it off, or get to somewhere where I can stop hearing it (or, in the rare cases that neither have been possible, cause myself physical pain to distract myself). I apparently have some strong traits associated with autistic spectrum disorders, and perhaps this is linked."

AskUK,fe7oyyo,t1_fe7ikga,1578917524.0,"It does not logically follow from the fact that I chose to use the Nazis as a humourously excessive example to illustrate the point that the argument is weak.

It does have a huge impact on consumers though. Many people have said that they don't like the reformulated versions, and manufacturers pass on the increase in price to consumers where they don't do this. Economic theory would suggest that both will share the burden. 

In an imperfect market, you do need to do this I guess. We stop producers putting toxic chemicals in foodstuffs because it is not reliably the case that consumers will know and simply not buy them, and doing the same with sugar does make sense I guess to some extent. It does feel offensively patronising, but perhaps that is just how I'm looking at it. 

I think that market imperfections also cause a problem too: for most of these drinks you cannot also buy the original formulation if that is what you want, so ultimately the effect is similar to a ban. 

I think a very significant issue is that they have failed to take sufficient account of how different artificial sweeteners seem to taste to people. Many people describe the drinks as tasting horrible now, whereas others say they taste similar. I, for one, find Diet Coke* to be unbearable sweet, but others say that it tastes less sweet than normal Coke. I think the government has acted without researching this sufficiently. 

Another issue that I feel the government has failed to research enough before acting is that there is evidence that the artificial sweeteners used instead are pretty bad for you too.

I think you make a good point though, and viewed like that, it is more reasonable. 

*The original Diet Coke, not Coke Zero. I know this one isn't as a result of the tax and uses sweeteners not as good as more modern ones. I do find most sugary fizzy drinks much less satisfying now though, meaning I think I drink more of them on the rare occasions I do (I actually don't drink them much), and enjoy it less. For me, I don't think the sugar tax has had an appreciable impact on my sugar consumption."

If the issue was really about internalising the external cost of diabetes treatment, why not tax type 2 diabetics?

AskUK,fe6v0a1,t1_fe6ugim,1578905761.0,"It almost certainly leads to less use of health services in the long run as obease people die earlier, often of heat attacks that are not drawn out, whereas heathier people live for a long time as elderly people who tend to have a lot of expensive medical conditions and need a lot of care, as well as drawing their pensions.

The Nazis thought that the government had the right to kill people it didn't like. Obviously opinions about what the government has a right to do vary. I don't think there is any reasonable basis for the government to regulate behaviour that is not more harmful to others than it is beneficial to the person choosing it.

Replace ban bad relationships with tax people in them more then, however people who are in them are unlikely to be able to pay enough tax for it to be an appropriate amount, so it would have to be a ban really. While we're at it, any sort of dangerous sport, cycling (yes, exercise is good, but it is safer in a gym), eating meat, having sex outside if marriage (STDs and unwanted pregnancies are bad), not doing homework, we could go on forever.

The point is that there is no good reason to be doing this that outweighs the reduction in people's feelings. You argue that it just costs more, but people have finite income, so it forces people to choose between it and something when they should not have to.

If it is a service dog and they have left it alone, I would assume it was I'll, and if it was barking repeatedly, I would assume it had got worse and needed urgent veterinary attention. I don't think this is unreasonable.

If a dog soiled the room, I would charge the owner to clean it up, unless they had done so to an extremely high standard before checking out, whether it was a service dog or not. If it turned out not to be a service dog, the charge to clean up would be enormous. 

I don't work in a hotel, and dislike dogs though. Actual service dogs are usually better behaved than most people though and do not bother me.
