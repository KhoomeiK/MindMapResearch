clevelandcavs,ff9u98e,t3_esffta,1579721456.0,"They don’t even talk about the Tribe with players reporting in a month. I’m tired of hearing about the Browns. All my life they’ve sucked ass when they were actually here, before and after the move. Except ‘94 but we still knew the team wasn’t in the top tier back then."

Browns,fepah2t,t1_fep8msq,1579315789.0,"Yep, and we’re still here. I just don’t give a shit about new coaches and GMs and coordinators. I’d rather read about how we’re gonna fix the O-line, defense, etc."
Browns,fepaawv,t1_fep9xts,1579315677.0,This is true :/

Browns,fe3imny,t3_enq0xn,1578849599.0,"I think this is bad, in my opinion. That offense looked terrible yesterday and they are essentially the Browns - great running back, good receivers, solid quarterback."
Browns,fdxhmr4,t3_enbc27,1578768792.0,"My thinking is that if it were McDaniels, they would’ve announced it by now but since it’s a current assistant coaching in the playoffs, that’s why there’s been no announcement"

Browns,fdjyyz9,t3_ellnjc,1578491807.0,You really can’t compare quarterbacks stats today versus 20 years ago since the game has changed so much to favor the passing game.
