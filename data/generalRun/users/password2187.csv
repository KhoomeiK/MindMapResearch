HermitCraft,fc985o0,t1_fc89bf8,1577548563.0,"Minecraft works based on chunks. Nothing happens in a chunk (16 by 16 area) if it is not loaded. A chunk is only loaded if there is someone somewhat near it (or some other things but it would take a while to get into). If nobody is even in the same dimension, that chunk cannot be loaded so nothing can happen. Therefore, nothing would happen until the chunk is loaded, presumably by Iskall logging back on (or Mumbo going through the portal in the case of what actually happened)"
