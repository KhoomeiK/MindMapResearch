Designer dogs are the WORST IDEA. Maybe do some sidebar reading"
dogs,ffir36i,t1_ffi5l1z,1579980598.0,"Clarify what? This is said all the time about how mixing dogs makes them healthier which isn’t true. How is this the truth? Maybe if you got a purebred from a shitty byb. Which is why many people say purebred doesn’t mean it’s well bred. There are purebred puppy mill dogs for example. You can probably search here and find many posts on why. I know someone here had some scholarly  articles on it...

Also nobody is anti rescue? Maybe anti getting a dog that isn’t right for you.

edit: Also OP wants to suggest a designer dog! These breeders who make these dogs are the reason we have so many puppy mills and mixes in rescues. Ya, nothing their saying is coming from an actual educated standpoint"

dogs,ffbb49j,t1_ffb8aht,1579758149.0,"I wouldn’t call it quality if dogs are still passing away from each boutique like diets. Not all the dogs are goldens - they are just the loudest group. That poor breed has so many issues - they didn’t want nutritional dcm on top of it.

Which is also the difference. This type of dcm if caught early, gets better and can even go away if you switch away from those diets. 

Join the fb group (maybe even the memorial group for the dogs that have died. Not everyone could afford to get into the study or are close by. The treatment is expensive). good luck - don’t fall for marketing please ):"

dogs,ff9cr4t,t1_ff98zr5,1579710078.0,"currently we don’t know what items are bad but foods heavy in legumes, peas, potatoes (sweet potatoes) should be avoided. those are usually boutique foods anyways.

dogs,ff7k8ug,t1_ff6ksuj,1579651525.0,"I stopped feeding this to my dog because it hasn’t had any recalls. They couldn’t afford a recall if one happened.

I also really wasn’t happy with how they are handling the dcm issue. Instead of listening, they changed the names on some of their food bags so it isn’t as obvious that they include potatoes.

Kind of sketchy to me. Plus I’d rather buy pro plan than spend $500+ to get a echo done on my dog"
dogs,ff7jxlx,t1_ff7c19r,1579651309.0,"or they expect you to adopt a dog that isn’t even in the country yet. so many rescues here show dogs that are still in the states and you can’t meet them first. Sorry but I don’t trust what is said about the dog. I wanna know how he will be in my house, with my pets. 

don’t get me started on the ‘rescue is the best breed’ thing. it’s as if people don’t realize a poodle and a shepherd are different dogs"
dogs,ff3zt9c,t1_ff3z796,1579552448.0,"It really depends on your location firstly. There are places that don’t have stray dogs.

Secondly it’s byb and puppy mills who are causing this issue in areas. The adopt don’t shop is very popular tbh. The people who want non rescues wouldn’t be going to a rescue either way. It’s how we educate these people that matter. Showing them designer dogs, fast puppies, pet shops is not the way. Those are the dogs showing up in the shelters. Why do you think you don’t see goldens, tollers, corgis, etc in shelters? (If you do, those temperaments are nuts)

dogs,feo04ap,t1_feni3g2,1579293318.0,"The issue I don’t think is just grain free but more of a boutique food issue but since not many people pay to get echos done, it’s hard to spot (plus it’s a silent killer). I wasn’t feeding grain free - it was a formula with grains. So right now it’s kinda iffy what actually is causing the issue. Since when the dogs who have gotten diagnosed switch to approved diets, they have gotten better.

Obviously the very advanced dogs with nutrition caused dcm haven’t :/"

Just monitor your dog. I give mine bully sticks, I know he will chew it into tiny pieces before swallowing so I don’t take it away. Other pet owners take the chew away once they become small enough and can cause a choking risk"

the mix is a horrible idea, we don’t need more designer mutt puppies in this world, these dogs probably don’t have any health testing (hips, eyes, elbows, etc). Also what titles do your dogs have to make them worthy of breeding?

Add on what I said above and half these rescues don’t even know what they are adopting out half the time (I’ve seen dogs that were stated 1 year and good with cats. they were really 4-5 and very bad around other animals) . Most rescues around here are so selective they won’t even adopt out to you unless you’ve gone through 7484 hoops.

we should promote getting a dog that is for your lifestyle. Whether a mutt from the shelter or a show trial golden. No dog is better.
