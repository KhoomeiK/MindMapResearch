PublicFreakout,ffu0pm4,t3_ev002m,1580231974.0,"He kept his composure so well, didn't interrupt the lunatic while she tried to get her BS point across, schooled her with real life lessons, and then removed himself from the situation when it was going nowhere. And he's A HOTTIE. I loved this."
StardewValley,ffggfk6,t1_ffeu6tp,1579905660.0,"So yes, to elaborate on the squiggly worm answer, it was a hole leftover from a squiggly worm at the very end of winter. The hole was still there on day 1 of spring so I kept something planted there all year."

AskReddit,ffdfwn8,t3_est2b4,1579820032.0,"Well, my sister and I went to an adults birthday party once and she had a pinata stuffed with little Texas shaped glass bottles of tequila (great fucking idea, right?) My sister happened to be standing in the worst spot in the backyard and when the pinata busted, those heavy glass bottles went flying and one smacked her in the face and gave her a nasty shiner for like a week and a half. Not long after, she got punched in the other eye by TWO drunk dudes when a huge fight broke out at a club we were at. Poor thing, I felt soooooo bad for her."

Advice,ff9mqiz,t1_ff5syo3,1579716239.0,"I think it depends on the person. We're all very different and have different needs. Most practices have therapist bios that explain their respective fields of expertise, therapy styles, personal backgrounds, etc. So you can get an idea of who would be best to help you with your particular needs, be it depression, grief, anger management, etc. In most cases you will have email exchanges with your potential therapist before your first appointment, to see if the relationship would be a good fit. And you can always see someone else if it doesn't work out, you're never stuck with a particular therapist."
Austin,ff9jqo9,t3_esd2rp,1579714475.0,He let me park for free in his backyard once when I couldn't find a street spot. What a guy.
Advice,ff5945e,t3_erod8g,1579583939.0,"My insurance doesn't cover mental health, so I had to pay out of pocket. But I found a highly rated therapy clinic that did rate discounts, chose a therapist, and set up an appointment. I liked her, so I kept seeing her. She eventually gave me a list of referrals for a psychiatrist, who in turn prescribed my medications that now help me every day. I feel like that's probably the most basic way for most people."

depression,fe5t20u,t3_enrs4c,1578874315.0,"I felt this way at first, too. But my best friend kept urging me to seek therapy, and my therapist in turn urged me to seek a psychiatrist. Turns out my perceived depression was very real and treating it made things a lot better."
