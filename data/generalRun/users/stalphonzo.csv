falloutsettlements,ff3uuxu,t3_erid3k,1579549353.0,"Gallery and notes: [https://imgur.com/gallery/BCUddKv](https://imgur.com/gallery/BCUddKv) 

Looks good at night so I did a night gallery: [https://imgur.com/gallery/oCyIxaW](https://imgur.com/gallery/oCyIxaW) 

This is probably my favorite attempt at a settlement. The idea from the start was to build it organically, with each building telling a story of how the town came to be. Who is this person? How will they be able to contribute? What sort of building will they need? And see how things grow. I even spent time fussing over each npc's wardrobe, weapons, and belongings, which helped bring personalities into focus and informed the build.

The Plaza up by the road attracts all kinds of folks. There's a hospitality area for The Traders (complimentary coffee and noodles and plenty more at a fair price), Kelly's Boarding House, Weapons, Armor, Tailor, and Dr. Fantastic, who never said he was a ""Doctor"" exactly but he thinks he can help you with your insomnia.

The locals don't like the tourists just wandering around, but if you make it through the alley, there's The Village. There's a hang out cookfire, a bar that's open almost 24/7 except when Jeannie and Al are fighting (it helps that one of them is asleep most of the time), and a pretty good General Store. Caroline has uncanny luck finding deals. Most of the residences are clustered here as well.

The Greenhouse and agriculture extend west and south, and most of the crafting is incorporated into the northern defense wall. They make a big show of the Wind Power Farm on top of the movie screen, but the real power is a small nuclear reactor hidden above the old diner. Please don't tell Mr. Fantastic.

I really like how intricate it turned out and I had a lot of fun playing with ways to make vanilla objects less of a gray wash using objects, contrast and light. Hope you like it!

This is a standard build on a pc with few mods. SOE and bits of Snappy. OCD Decorator. And I hope not too obvious use of Creative Clutter, which is indispensable for those of us who don't have much patience placing hundreds of objects. To overcome size limit, I had to use the storage glitch a number of times.
