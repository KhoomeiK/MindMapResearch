AskParents,fe0p24c,t3_enilyc,1578816977.0,"I was actually just thinking about this earlier tonight. My daughter is only 8 months, but I was thinking, what the hell am I going to say when this curious child asks about my scars. The scars on my arm are covered with a tattoo. You can still kind of see them, definitely not as obvious if I didn't have the tattoo. No idea how I'd explain that. I think most who see them assume what they are, because I've only been asked once about them, and that was by my now husband and I told him the truth even though we had only been dating a month. The ones on my leg, I always blame on a ricer tubing trip, but I'm not sure how believable that is. P"

depression,fd0zprt,t3_ejsoej,1578125971.0,"I've found that when I feel this way, it's just that the people who do care may not know how to relate, it may make them feel uncomfortable to discuss it or ask questions to the point they just put it in the back of their mind or it is on their mind, but they just can't get to a place where they can discuss it with you or check in on you. I've been suffering from PPD for months and I had a couple of friends who would check in on me from time to time, but even most of my closest friends and my mom, who would do anything for me, kind of got silent on the issue. Don't take the fact that you may not see that they care, or the people around you don't know how to show that they care, as an indication that they don't care. Most of them do, and unfortunately that's the benefit of the doubt we have to give them. I'm the type of person, because I've experienced so much depression, that if a friend tells me they're depressed, I make a conscious effort to check in on them and let them know that someone cares and is thinking about them. But most aren't like this and mostly because they don't have or don't recognize depression."

depression,fd0ip7k,t3_dk2mco,1578119367.0,"Wondering if you tried this combo as I am thinking about it. I was originally on wb, then doc switched me to zoloft about 4 years ago, because we were trying to have a baby and it was safer. Zoloft worked wonders on me, never fell into a deep depression in those 4 years despite losing 3 pregnancies, putting down 2 dogs and some other heavy shit. After stopping breastfeeding, I switched back to wb, because zoloft killed my sex drive. While switching to wb has definitely increased my libido, I'm feeling terribly depressed and want my zoloft back, so I was thinking of adding a half dose od my zoloft back in with my wb to see if that combo retains some of my libido while also truly helping me with my depression."
depression,fcx04lt,t3_ej4ay4,1578045233.0,"It will get better, I promise. I've had multiple pregnancy losses and even had to terminate one, because it was ectopic. My first miscarriage was around 9 weeks too and it was a ""missed miscarriage"", meaning we went in for a check up and didn't hear a heartbeat, but my body hadn't miscarried her. I had the option of waiting to miscarry naturally, but since some women never do, I opted for the d&c, because I also didn't want to risk having to see the baby if I miscarried. The fear that you can't forget that image is real, but I will tell you that, as someone who has many (too many) friends who have suffered late miscarriages and even stillbirths, you will find your new normal. Your new normal will be that you lost a child, but it may also be that that child wasn't the one for you. Maybe there was a genetic issue, maybe you would have lost it later if you hadn't lost it then. I'm not a believer in ""everything happens for a reason"" but when it's science, it typically happens for some reason, so look ahead and know that tomorrow will be better than today, next week will be even easier and you will find your new normal. There may be random days that are tough, but they will pass."

I've been there though, and honestly, I've been so down lately, there's only one thing that is keeping me here, my baby, and I want to be here for her as long as I can. My life has been a Rollercoaster, true ups and downs, so if you ever need to be reminded that life is worth hanging onto for those ups, reach out to me."

depression,fcwz9ny,t3_cml6ni,1578044101.0,"I don't sleep anymore. I feel like I have so much angry/hurt energy, I just can't sleep. I'm so exhausted too and I plead with myself that I'm going to go to sleep at a reasonable hour every night, but then the night comes and there's nothing I can do to fall asleep. I don't have dreams anymore, only nightmares, so maybe that has something to do with it."
badparking,fc4rvjs,t1_fc4qypn,1577426123.0,"Our police department is actually called out to the local Walmart all the time, because the handicap parking spaces get filled up and some jackass with a permit then takes it upon themselves to just turn the access aisle into their own parking space and then people can't get back into their already legally parked vehicle.

Edit: grammar."
badparking,fc4rqw6,t1_fc4qypn,1577425992.0,"[Here](https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/organization/disabilities/accessible_parking_fast_facts.pdf) is a PDF of commonly asked questions. See Page 5 where it states that it is illegal ""To park a car in such a way that it blocks access to an accessible parking space, an access aisle, or any architectural improvement that provides access for people with disabilities, such as a ramp or a curb cut."" [Texas Transportation Code Section 681.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/TN/htm/TN.681.htm) lists this offense under Subsection (c) and states, in part, that: ""A person commits an offense if the person stands a vehicle so that the vehicle blocks an architectural improvement designed to aid persons with disabilities, including an access aisle or curb ramp."" Those striped lanes indicate an access lane. If the person driving this pace car has a passenger who needs extra room to enter and exit the vehicle, they should back into the parking space or park in one of the several other handicap parking spaces that have access aisles on the passenger side of the vehicle. As someone who has aided my parents getting my sister in and out of the car via a wheelchair ramp pretty much my entire life, it's pretty infuriating to have the only handicap parking spot available rendered completely useless, because another driver with h/c parking rights has parked across the access aisle."
badparking,fc4q1qb,t1_fc4niit,1577424322.0,"It's actually illegal (in Texas) to park over the access lines, regardless of whether or not you have a handicap placard or license plate. This person could get a ticket that holds a minimum $500 fine. Those access lanes are for his parking spot and the handicap parking spot next to it, so he's actually impeding the access lanes for the car parked in the next handicap spot. Source: I'm a criminal prosecutor and actually prosecute these exact types of offenses. But on a personal note, my sister is wheelchair-bound and we count on the passenger-side access lanes to get her out."
