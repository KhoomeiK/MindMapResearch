If you wanna make a spin off game about Detlaff and Regis, then whatever.... but that’s not a Witcher game and it’s not gunna carry the title of Witcher. It wouldn’t make sense. That’s like making a walking simulation and calling it Need for Speed. Yes it exists in the universe, but not the focal point. Like... you wouldn’t make a Star Wars game specifically about Jawas... come on man."

Marvel would totally not bring back someone like Jake Gyllenhaal as Quentin Beck/Mysterio to replace him with another version of Mysterio played by a small, insignificant side character created in Iron Man (2008) and brought back for Far From Home (as a flimsy connection to Tony Stark) portrayed by a C list actor like Peter Billingsley.

gamedev,ff986t1,t3_esdeyi,1579707088.0,"I would just check out some Computer Science programs, because many have multiple concentrations. For example, I am interested in the programming and video game side so my concentration within the CS program is AI, Robotics, and Game Design. So not only do I take courses that teach C# and game design/development principals, but I’ve also had to take some courses in Python and learn about AI algorithms and machine learning, so I’m not tied down to JUST video games. I’ve also had to take just a basic Software Development course as one of my foundation courses, which sounds a lot like the course you’ve taken that deals with the design and management side of creating programs and apps. I think any CS concentration would give you a good basic foundation. I would just look into several CS programs and see what concentrations are offered and see which sounds interesting to you. I know my program offers other things like Data Science, Software Engineering (this sounds like what you’re interested in), Bioinformatics, Cybersecurity, Web and Mobile Applications (more specialized branch you might also be interested in), and a few others. You should really just talk with an advisor and see what’s out there and what interests you most."

cyberpunkgame,fel10xg,t3_eppqrw,1579211746.0,"Animation is 100% complete. There’s no correlation between programming, animating, sound/voice recording. Music, sound and voice acting is one of the last things to be done, even in the film industry. Look at the new Bond film, No Time to Die: it releases in April and they just hired Hans Zimmer to score the film and Billie Eilish to record the theme. This delay also has nothing to do with the PS5 release. The PS4 and PS5 versions would be developed independently. PS4 could be finished and released while PS5 continues development. That argument makes no sense.   

The most logical reason for delay is to avoid competition with other big games releasing near the same time. Final Fantasy 7 originally was set to release in March, but was just delayed to April 10 two days ago. That would have put Cyberpunk initially releasing just a few days later. I believe the biggest reason is to give some breathing room between two big releases, plus gives the devs more time to polish as they said, without having to rush to release in April.   

The comical thing about this to me is that I think Square Enix delayed Marvel’s Avengers game to avoid being overshadowed by Cyberpunk. So they delayed Avengers until September, but also the delay of FFVII encroached on Cyberpunks release date. So as a fuck you, I think CDPR picked September to again compete with Avengers. That may not be true at all, but it’s funny to think so."

MarvelAvengersProject,fegtsbl,t3_ep3n4m,1579102361.0,"I dunno. It’s definitely not as massive as adding in free roam/open world components but 4 months is a substantial delay so I think it’s more than just some slight polishing and bug tweaks. Somethings not right, since original release date was about 4 months from now and we’ve seen very little gameplay. 

Edit: I actually think it has something to do with Cyberpunk2077 releasing just a few weeks before and a few other big games like RE:3 and Doom:Eternal, pushing back a few months will keep it from being overshadowed."
