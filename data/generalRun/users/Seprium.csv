makinghiphop,fgk4bp6,t3_eyyas3,1580857199.0,"To get paid, you need a LOT of streams (or a label deal). DistroKid gives you all the money for streams, and you still own your music. It's not like you need to file a patent, just don't make it downloadable.

EDIT: once you build a big enough following, then P.R.O.s are a good idea"
edmproduction,fgewvu9,t1_fge3hsn,1580713181.0,"I found out yesterday that echo sound works made an Illenium inspired pack, then Illenium actually used samples from that for some of his latest music! Whatever makes the best sound that fits your style or brand, it's not 'cheating' per say. That being said, I totally agree that it can take the unique sound out of your music if you just drag and drop everything. I strongly feel that too many amateur producers don't know shit about music theory or sound design and you can tell when you hear the music. Cheers!"

Bass,fg9e7je,t1_fg8l70b,1580637594.0,"I see, I am an amateur at-home producer so I've never taken my bass or guitar out of the house since I bought them now that I think about it! The turtle is on there pretty tight, actually takes a good amount of force to separate from the string since the lowest string is so thick. I can see it just being one more thing to lose on a gig though"

edmproduction,fg7j10n,t1_fg7ihh4,1580593702.0,"It's just sitting on my hard drive, I just consider it good practice at this point because I'm still learning and defining my own style. If you're proud of your work then don't be afraid to put it out there. Odds of the big name artist seeing it or reacting is low, but you might gain a little traction from their other followers, so go for it. Best of luck, friend."

edmproduction,fg72r75,t3_exa4b6,1580582629.0,"IMO part of making lyrics that are really good is just practice, I'm trying to work on it myself. It can be hard staying away from the 'easy' rhymes that tend to sound cringey, for example, rhyming 'high' with 'fly'. Most songs use 'slant rhymes', which are words that sound similar enough to flow but don't directly rhyme, like in Porter's new song ('get your wish' - 'the surface'). Eminem has a really good (and funny) video about this that is applicable to songwriting in general that I recommend:

dubstep,ffrds3v,t1_ffqq7vj,1580156012.0,"Thanks for the feedback, yeah there's something not quite right about that lead bass sound, but it's going somewhere. I might just transpose the whole track down until that bass purrs just right, that's a solid idea. It's actually a live bass with camelcrusher and some LFOs, so I could try to just play it an octave lower as well.   


I appreciate it!"
