I never stopped to think about your statement before.. but its completely true. If my buddy comes over.. his wife is just texting him all the time. We were watching a show and I was laughing pretty hard. I look over to do that weird.. ""bro wasn't that shit hilarious?"" He's texting her. We go on a camping trip with our friends.. gotta save battery life because she's texting him. It's like, we can't just have fun and do shit. He's gotta always reply to her or she'll call and be like ""when you coming home?"" I feel for him. 

My wife might text me once or twice when I'm out."

sca,fdes0wx,t1_fdenr6b,1578345400.0,"I've been in the SCA for about 4 years now. I got introduced to it briefly about 12 years ago, but not much came of it. About 6 years ago I had moved to a city halfway across the country and decided to look it up again. 

I went to a fighter practice, and some of the monthly populace meetings and it quickly grew on me. The passion these folks had really lit a fire in me. They enabled me to do research and hunt for the things I like, and introduced me to aspects of the middle ages I never even thought about. You'll find lots of local groups too. It's a world wide organization and if one group doesn't have what you need, you can go play with others who might. I'm fortunate to be in a shire sandwiched between 2 baronies and it makes for a great community. I was an outsider, and I found an extended family. I wish you all the best in your journey, and maybe one day, we will meet and share a glass."
sca,fde60qj,t1_fde1c0s,1578331946.0,"This 110%, solid answer. To add if I may:

The SCA is like a social club for folks who have a love of, not just history, but all things encompassing the past. Art, Music, food, tradeskills, combat, games, ordinary life etc.. 

Come into the society with the hope of learning new things. You'll meet people who are passionate and will be more than willing to teach or find information you want to learn.

Come with an empty slate and fill it with knowledge and comradrie. Have a pint with a brewer, listen to a bard sing their tales, watch the plethora of artists or fighters work their art.The SCA is as diverse as the world we live in. You will meet people of all ages, ethnicities, and creeds, and we all strive for The Dream."
