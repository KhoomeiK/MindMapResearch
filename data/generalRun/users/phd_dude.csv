mdphd,fds5huo,t3_emt9ac,1578694805.0,"Seriously, if you are serious about a career as a physician scientist, going to your top research school should be your priority.  You can get through a few years of mandatory lectures but the thought of spending 4-6 years doing research or the caliber of research that you don‚Äôt want to do is much more difficult.  

Do what you want but I think that this is a really bad reason to avoid your top research opportunity."

medicalschool,fcx9iaw,t3_eiwyfs,1578056425.0,"**If you want to cancel your Yale Psychiatry Interview even last minute, they know I can take it**

TL/DR:  If you have been wanting to cancel your interview at Yale Psychiatry, or are not very interested in going there, I can take any remaining spots and they are aware of this (literally even with a few days or one day notice). 

I have been on the waiting list to interview at Yale Psychiatry for some time.  I am a MD PhD student who would love to collaborate with some of the research faculty there.  Additionally,  this is the location where my spouse would like to raise our children.  It is my dream program.

I am not advocating that anyone should just give me the spot.  You have earned it.  However, if you are not actually that interested, have already found your perfect match at a previous interview, or want to cancel for any other reason, know that canceling last minute will not offend them and that they know that I am willing and able to take any last minute cancelation.  

PM me if you have any questions or if you want to try to swap remaining interviews (if possible)."
