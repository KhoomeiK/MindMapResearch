Apollo: Hypocratic Oath doctors take and the Olympics. And did anyone mention how much he LOVES pretty boys?

Artemis: turned a peeping tom into a deer and hunted him down with his own hounds. Talk about female empowerment and a feminist icon! And she runs around with 100 of the most beautiful nymphs when she hunts.

Athena: We still talk about the great scholars that worshipped her by exploring philosophy and mathematics. A maiden and she's sticking to it because she's too busy being awesome to want romance, like the Ace that she is.

Aphrodite: literally the word Aphrodisiacs. And you cannot name a more sexually empowered goddess. Men, women, both, neither, didn't matter. If she saw beauty, she was going to have a piece of it.

Hermes: talaria, his winged hat, and the caduceus are seen all over the place. (The last one being the reason so many people think HE is the god of medicine.) Also a total play boy that like to play both sides of the field.

Hera: peacocks, her favorite birds, are still a wedding design staple. And a cautionary example of the bitterness marrying for power/money can cause.

Zeus: his lightning bolt is still iconic. And so is his inability to understand the word no.

Poseidon: boats still bear his name and the names of his children. We still think of ""The Old Man of the Sea"" and the image in our heads is based off of him. Also unable to understand the word no.

Demeter: her cornucopia still symbolizes the fall and harvest.

Persephone: Um hello! Gets dragged off to the underworld, maybe gets tricked into eating the food of the dead, and decides ""fine. I'm gonna rock this."" Changes her name to ""The Destroyer"" and comes up with the most creative punishments for the biggest offenders.

The Rich One: Okay, so he gets a bad rap in the modern world. But who doesn't recognize Kerberos? (Or rather Spot.) Who doesn't see a tall, dark figure in a helm and think his name? And he is the most supportive and loyal husband in the pantheon. His love and devotion may have started out poorly, but things improved, and he just can't say no to her, even when it breaks the rules, and he is all about the rules. Their marriage is a prime example of a healthy hetero and monogamous relationship.

Ares: Marines, the elite man-to-man fighting force of the larges military in world are called Jarheads. (Okay this is just me poking fun, but it fits)

Apollo was poking fun at Eros about how children shouldn't play with bows, and he was going to shoot his eye out.

Pissed, Eros not only shot Apollo with a golden arrow of love the moment he saw Daphne, he also shot Daphne with a lead arrow of hate. That's why she ran.

Daphne ran to her father, a river god, for help, not Aphrodite. Aphrodite wouldn't have done anything to interfere with Eros's revenge.

When he finally caught her, just before she was turned completely into a laurel tree, he begged her to know why she ran, and all she could say was ""I don't know.""

In the end, he still took leaves from her branches and wore them as a crown, stealing pieces of her to possess even though she wanted nothing to do with him.

This was a warning not to disrespect Eros, who made a fool of even mighty Apollo, but also a reminder that fathers should protect their daughters, even from suitors that normally they would deem worthy of their daughter's hand,if she asks them to."

Chronos agreed, but once he'd overthrown Uranus, he changed his mind and instead left his half-siblings in Tartarus. Angry with his betrayal, Gaia cursed him to be betrayed by his children as his father had been before him. This led to him eating his children, and the a rock, Zeus rescuing his siblings, and again with Gaia's help, overthrowing Chronos with the promise to release Gaia's children. Zeus also noped out of the deal, and Gaia placed the same curse on him, but instead of trying to off his kids, he just had a whole bunch of them. Technically Apollo was supposed to fulfill Gaia's curse, and he is actually more powerful than Zeus, but he likes his dad and is too busy doing his own thing to take over.

I moved 13 times and had lived in 7 different states by the time I was 18.

My parents divorced when I was 4, and I spent the next 14 years travelling from one side of the US to the other and back at least once a year; sometimes by air and sometimes by road.

I had my first near-fatal asthma attack at 4 months old. I had both viral and bacterial meningitis when I was 6 months old. I had a near-fatal reaction to the MMR vaccine. I was in Florida for Hurricane Andrew. I had a ""seizure"" that shook a 3 story house from the force of my head hitting the wall. My bio-father put a crack in my skull (different event from the seizure thing). And I discovered the hard way that I had a deadly berry allergy.

I can tell stories for hours on end. From fiction to truth to a mix of both, words pour forth from my lips and if I'm lucky, I can capture them in print.

I watch a grill lid fly out of nowhere and take out a car that cut me off. It was a solid metal one too. Three people in the car witnessed it with me. No one could explain how a gust of wind could move a grill lid like that, when it didn't crumple under the car's weight. I watched a semi jack-knife around my car on an icy freeway, missing my bumpers by scant inches before straightening out. I've been on the Dan Ryan expressway in Chicago, and I was the only car in sight. I've replaced the batteries in my emergency trunk flashlight and found the exact amount it cost me sitting in a puddle next to my tire, as I returned to my car. I've been buffeted back onto the sidewalk by the wind, only to have a car run the red light. I've watched as the rain stopped just long enough for me to get from one class to the next across campus on such a consistent basis, that my classmates would wait until I left before hurrying to their car or the next building.

It only makes sense that I feel a particular connection to the god of travels, roads, and the wind; the psychopomp that closes the eyes of the dead for eternity and escorts them to the edge of the River Styx; to the messenger god that kept the 100 eyed giant enraptured in a story so dull, yet so interesting, that he eventually closed all of his 100 eyes; to the trickster that enjoys meddling in the affairs of mortals.

Concentrate on your energy and how it feels.

If your aura is a more rigid thing, then build a mental fortress, a castle from which you may defend your spirit, as the narcissism lays siege to your defenses.

If your aura is more of a nebulous or fluid thing, work on letting it shift and move like sand on the beach, so that when the narcissism crashes over you like a wave, it takes nothing with and leaves nothing behind.

And when you have a moment to yourself again, meditate and reinvigorate your aura. You need not be victorious in evert battle to win the war. There will be times when your fortress falls or you beach is eroded. It's okay. You are stronger than you know."

Giving uneducated/self-serving answers that further only your own self narrative poses the opportunity to do more harm than good and offend the very deity (s)he wishes to exalt. How would you have liked it if someone responded to your questions about contacting demons with a suggestion to anoint yourself with holy water and take communion before attempting to commune? That is what, in essence, you did here."
pagan,fdg420c,t1_fdg30gh,1578379208.0,"To each their own, but Apollo (and the Grecian gods in general) gets super angry with anyone putting themselves on equal ground to him. This person wishes to worship him. (S)he needs to be respectful of the Grecian ways if it is truly Apollo (s)he wishes to worship and not simply the idea of him."
pagan,fdg3s95,t3_ekeq4d,1578378921.0,"I was raised Christian, but through school, I was exposed to the Grecian gods. I ate it up. I read every book in the library and moved on to their Roman incarnations, but the Greeks held a special place in my heart. I was still Catholic until I went to college. My econ teacher was Greek, and one day, after class, I overheard two guys talking about naming the battle bot they were working on Prometheus. We talked for a while and I ended up animatedly retelling them the whole story of how Prometheus created humans and why he stole fire from Olympus to give to us. They ended up going with Prometheus as their bot's name, and my teacher asked me to stick around after everyone else left.

He got me to tell him more stories and about how much I loved telling them to people. And then he dropped the bomb on me that my little Catholic brain had never grasped before: the gods are still being worshipped to this day.

The thing is, the gods get their power from worship, which means all gods that have ever been worshipped exist is some manner. That is what I hold true in my heart. From God and Jesus to Allah, from Zeus to Odin, From Titiana to Ra, From Shiva to the Celestial Bureaucracy, From Coyote to every unnamed deity remembered and forgotten and every god/goddess I didn't list, they all exist."
pagan,fdg2l4b,t1_fdewbxl,1578377684.0,"That is such a bad idea... Like he gave King Midas the ears of a donkey because he had the audacity to say Pan, a fellow god, was his equal in playing music. You NEVER put yourself equal to the gods. They are gods after all. You are but a mortal."
pagan,fdg2fr1,t3_el0zzh,1578377528.0,"There are so many things you can do:
Sing for him and tell his exploits to those around you.
Invoke the muses to inspire you.
Prometheus tricked Zeus into choosing both the best and the worst pieces of meat to be burned as offerings to the gods, so be it animal fat or the choicest cut, you could always burn some meat for him.
Turn your face to the sun (with your eyes closed because his glory is too bright to behold without hurting your eyes) and thank him for his radiance, for his warmth, and for the beauty he bestows upon the earth.
Volunteer at your local hospital; don't forget that he is the god of medicine. (My patron, Hermes is still trying to steal that from him. Don't let him.)
Write poetry about your favorite aspects of him. You wish to worship him for a reason; tell him why you think he's so amazing.
Some traditional methods of worship/festivals are only supposed to be performed by the people of certain villages and performing them outside those ancient rules dilutes them. Be sure to do your research and find multiple sources before performing rituals.
Devote time, energy, and love to him in many small ways, and it will become as natural as breathing.
And don't forget to worship Artemis and sing her praises too. He loves her above all others, after all."
