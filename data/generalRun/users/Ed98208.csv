Although back when I was online dating I always made sure the first date wasn't expensive because I didn't want the guy to think I owed him anything or that I was just looking for a free meal. It's just really tricky because some guys are insulted if the women insists on paying for all or part of the meal, and other guys are upset if she doesn't.
