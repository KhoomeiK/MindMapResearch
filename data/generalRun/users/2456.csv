onewheel,ffj3uay,t3_etvl2j,1579989697.0,That's a really cool concept to slap some super strong neodymium like that on the fender for screw-less removal and installation.
discordapp,ffgk5id,t3_et2keu,1579908093.0,"Ooh, that is slick. Any chance of making it a cog for Red?"
walmart,ff5tb0x,t1_ff5kkdt,1579609445.0,"Well in this case it would be a matter of changing the DD information of whomever you ""terminated"" and then keeping their WIN/login information for safekeeping.   Toggle them on/off the clock to get yourself an extra $80 a week per worker basically. As long as you don't touch the W4 information the fired worker might never realize they are still being paid since their taxes would still get them a refund on the end."
walmart,ff567ke,t3_erkhip,1579581379.0,My joke is it's clearly an embezzlement scheme by someone.  They use all these random workers and toggle them on just often enough to pocket some money into a special direct deposit account.
todayilearned,fen0cj1,t1_femz4u6,1579274119.0,"Well yeah, but there are implementations that vary the level of laser intensity.  That said I believe a couple organizations trying to make it easier for whistleblowers to relieve grievances have developed software that basically overrides the hidden labeling if it was really needed."
todayilearned,femxkrt,t1_femxces,1579272223.0,In the 1980s was around when they were developed to assure the US government that bills couldn't be counterfeited on their printers. Wasn't public knowledge till the 2000s though.
todayilearned,femtwz7,t1_femtl6s,1579269486.0,But then he would have those printer dots that are practically invisible that identify the printer.
HadesTheGame,fdf15fo,t1_fde34ya,1578350961.0,Sweet! I am happy to hear that it will be looked into :D Do you have a debug mode that triggers slow-mo?
HadesTheGame,fdcf776,t1_fdbdezz,1578273411.0,"Hey, just because I happened to see your name flaired with Supergiant QA I want to as if you had seen this post https://old.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/ejysmt/my_hitbox_broke_hard_against_the_final_boss_on_my/  and if you had any information on it.  I know that spin always seems to hit me outside of what looks like the range.  Just want to know if there is a bug with its hitbox or can they increase the size of the swing effect so it looks more accurately to where you will be hit."
technology,fd3qnrp,t1_fd2yguy,1578160871.0,Iirc printers often use cyan added to black to make it richer. Changing the settings to Draft quality would lessen or stop that completely at the cost of how it looks printed; ie black is more dark grey.
walmart,fd08094,t3_ejm7qw,1578115005.0,Good on the choice now. I discovered after the fact that my medical requests defaulted to ppto and our current people lead is stupid stubborn about things.  Like she would give you a point if you clocked out at 12 and put in 3 hours because you didn't take a lunch.  Or how she refused to take a point off of someone that went into labor and left 5 hours into her shift until the associate contacted other managers.
politics,fc9tr1b,t1_fc9oo7o,1577558099.0,God I hate the mental gymnastics I've seen on that camel one.
