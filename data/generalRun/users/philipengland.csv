UKPersonalFinance,ff8ibf7,t1_ff8hvzr,1579679785.0,Will check that out
UKPersonalFinance,ff8hsil,t1_ff8fe3o,1579679094.0,Definitely does... which is fine. I'd be interested to read the article.
UKPersonalFinance,ff8fmhy,t3_es1hty,1579676372.0,"We met in our mid 20s and we're now in our mid 30s.

We had little debt when we met (I bailed her out of a credit card in order to allow her to keep her car, which was a benefit to me and that was it). It means we've both essentially started our financial lives together.

I earn more than her, but my view is that we are a team. We both contribute equally to the household in terms of effort so therefore combine our earnings, have a joint budget and split our investments roughly equally. 

In reality it means we have an ISA each, a pension each, jointly own our property (soon to be properties) and we split our cash holdings roughly equally between accounts owned by us (not joint). It gives us both a neat exit strategy should she finally realise I'm a bit of a moron 😉

Our salary is paid into our own accounts and a series of transfers to other accounts pay our bills and investments. We share supplementary cards on cashback AMEX and Aqua accounts.

I look after the finances - she just isnt that interested in the setup and admin, and she jokingly refers to me as the Master of Coin whenever I ask her opinion on a budget for anything. ""You're the Master of Coin, Keeper of the purse, you tell me!"". But I make it my duty to ensure that she understands what our situation is just as much as it is her duty to understand it. So she knows what we do, what accounts we own and how she should access them. Her only insistence is that she wants our salaries paid into our own accounts. She trusts me but wants to maintain some independence should things go wrong. I couldn't agree more with this sentiment.

Lastly, we plan together, which is probably the most important reason of why you need transparency in a relationship in my opinion. She isn't fussed about the setup but we reguarly discuss careers goals, pay negotiations, investment / saving goals. I created spreadsheets and we both review these spreadsheets reguarly. I explain everything and she asks questions. It's a good exercise for both of us.

As I suggested, our mentality is that we are a team, but I think this is helped by the fact we have similar financial goals, lifestyle aspirations etc. Combining our finances allows us to work towards our goals faster, we have more financial clout as a team, so it works for us."

todayilearned,fec49tr,t3_eo69vw,1578966435.0,"I've rented scooters in Asia. In fact, I'm currently in India and rented one last week. The horn is vital.

Honking for blind corners and to let people know you're passing is especially important.

There are so many different types of vehicles or different engine powers and designs that when you're on the road as a westerner it is actually incredibly helpful, especially when you hear a beep behind you to let you know they intend to pass.

In one country in Asia (I think it was Myanmar or Sri Lanka) we had a driver explain to us that they actually teach you to use the horn during driving lessons and it is part of the test.

Another little difference in Asia is despite being incredibly chaotic on the roads, the people for the most part are generally more docile. I've seen a significantly less amount of road rage when compared to the UK (where I actually live)."

Liverpool,fcu4kpl,t3_eix3gf,1577972398.0,"Good.

My partner got the train to work (Liverpool to Birchwood) before christmas rather than driving because of the office christmas party.

The 2 carriage rush hour train got to birchwood, but didn't stop. They annnounced they couldnt stop because of ""over crowding"" and the train proceeded to Manchester. 

They then were told to get off. Then get another over-crowded train back to Birchwood. She had to stand up the whole time. Despite planning to get in early for work for a call, she ended being more than an hour late.

Honestly ridiculous!"
todayilearned,fctsptd,t1_fcmuwo5,1577957520.0,"I'll admit I'm a little embarrassed now! But this is a nice thing to write, so thank you.

You know there are a lot of challenges in healthcare and we also know that what we're doing may not come off. 

Implementing IT solutions is particularly challenging in healthcare, especially when compared to any other industry I've worked in.

There have been moments honestly when I just wished I could go back to working for an ecommerce IT firm, or pack it in and go contracting!

But... I am hopefully in my conclusions when I think the challenges are worth it. All of our conversations are about improving patient outcomes. We have some very talented people involved in what we're doing and we believe we can change patient care for the better.

And anyway, seeing how challenging the health care industry is for the actual healthcare professional. I can't moan. Hence why I feel a little humbled by your comment!"
todayilearned,fctqniw,t1_fco493s,1577954504.0,"Forgive my late response, I'm actually on holiday / vacation in india - fair to say we have a fun time seeing in the new year!

happy to share the company details, although you won't find too much branding online today if you search. That is coming this year following a period of us piggybacking on existing services with partner businesses / organisations while we roadtest and prove the value of our software. 2020 is essentially the year we plan to offer out the services fully and the branding expansion is pencilled in for when I return to work.

The respiratory work is done with LungHealth. I'm the technical lead for that business.

But when we branched out to Sleep we created a separate business entity called SleepHealth. I'm a director for that business (while still being a hands-on technical lead)

All the products share the same codebase / platform."
todayilearned,fcmugp3,t1_fcmcsrc,1577792833.0,"So the focus is on Sleep Apnea, which right off the bat accounts for the majority of the sleep patients. It is also one of the easier one's to diagnose.

The main goal of sleep software is to try and diagnose these simpler cases, such as Apnea, and then refer the complicated cases on to the specialists. 

In our case these reviews can be run as telephone reviews with a non specialist using the software. The software can help us determine who needs further testing. We can then send out testing kits by post to patients that ""pass"" (these testing kits are like smart watches). We can then let the software analyse the results using the software from a few nights of wearing these watches.

From that we may be able to offer a diagnosis of something like Sleep Apnea, and in this case recommend CPAP (a machine that helps clear the airways at night). But some of these will may come with alerts depending on some of the information the patient gives, such as comorbidities or from their sleep habits.  

For example, the patient may have sleep Apnea but have a high BMI, which can be a cause for sleep apnea. In this case CPAP and lifestyle advise would be necessary. The same may apply with poor sleep hygiene. If you're sleepy but smashing the Red Bulls then this may be the cause of the insomnia! There are tons of considerations like these that our software is seemingly better than picking up than humans.

The key thing though is that a lot of causes for sleepyness can be relatively simple to diagnose because of the prevalence of conditions like sleep apnea. So having software that can identify that remotely is a massive boon for our over prescribed sleep services in the UK. As I suggested earlier, simple sleep disorder patients don't need to travel to a hospital for an initial review and the test. They avoid seeing a specialist altogether unless their case requires it.

Our software is very much in its infancy but it is looking incredibly positive. We are keen to expand and develop it much much further next year, but even in its current form early indication suggests it saves the patient's time and the specialist's time, while at the same time improving patient outcomes. 

It's looking like it is win win for everyone."
todayilearned,fcm36km,t1_fcm1fn7,1577763037.0,"I actually work in this field. And the first thing I can say is that there are things we can do before machine learning. 

For example, I write software that first manages and diagnosis lung disease in primary care in the UK. The software first ensures that the current guidelines are met. Simple as that.

Ie. By ensuring that the right tests are done, that the test results are accurately interpreted, that we are asking the right questions around the patients breathlessness to rule out lung cancer, cardiac problems and then ensuring that the management is correct - are they on the right inhalers for their severity? is their inhaler technique sound? etc

I've written similar software for other diseases, such as Sleep disorders.

The results are startling when comparing results of patients that run through our software than a usual health care professional. For example (and this is my favourite example of why this approach is the future in my view) - one of the main clinicians that I work with day to day that helped me clinically get the software right actually performs better himself when he uses the software in clinics. So think about that - even the expert that clinically worked up the software is better when clinically supported by that very same software he helped write.

So imagine then improvements for a junior? 

In fact, juniors are finding the software as a wonderful educational suite. Or so their feedback tells.

The next step is the machine learning approach. We're building up a respiratory and sleep database and we can start running machine learning algorithms to try and help improve the guidelines in the future."

UKPersonalFinance,fcdjrxj,t3_eh1aj7,1577610621.0,"Have a browse through udemy, maybe? It can be hit and miss but paying attention to reviews is worthwhile.

As a software engineer I've found it useful as an introduction to different technologies.

But honestly, I think it is worth considering what you want to improve.

If it isnt a vocation then also consider what soft skills or knowledge you want to improve. For these, then maybe consider The Great Courses. I get them through Audible but there are video versions on Amazon as well.

I've used these to improve my knowledge in various areas of science and history - as well as more applicable areas such as communication.

In fact, the courses in Effective Communication and Why We Are Who We Are have honestly contributed greatly to my personal and professional life more in recent years than all of other books and courses I've taken. The former discusses the science of communication and how to use this science to effectively communicate with others to ensure a positive outcome for yourself and the person you are communicating with. It discusses areas like conflict and how to manage yourself through difficult conversations through to how to talk people through their problems (this chapter was so powerful that I can honestly say I've grown closer to many people because of it - in and out of work).

The latter is about personality. It helped me determine the type of person I am, and just as importantly, it has helped me determine the personality types, motivation and goals of others I work with and love. Again, a bit of game changer for me.

Because both of these is based in science, the combination of these two is honestly like a super power. I genuinely think I'm a slightly better person because of it (although I'll be the first to admit I can always improve!)

But, whatever you decide - stay safe and thank you for serving. My brother served and I know just how challenging the life style is. Take care."

So I support Utd - and that support comes with a passion, but have a soft spot for other teams usually either because of Football Manager or because they've been my local team one time or another and I've been to watch them a few times.

But for the Utd game he had a single ticket and wasn't feeling well - so rang me and offered me it. ""I'd love to go!"" I said.

In my mind I would get away with being a neutral, just sitting quietly like I do when I watch any team I don't support. However, what I didn't consider for this game was that I'd be in the Kop, in Anfield - on a ""famous European night""...

You see, this was the Europa League game from a few seasons ago where you Kopshites won 2-0 and Utd's performance was just miserable. On these night's I learnt that fans will often try and sneak in with other fans by squeezing in the turnstile with you (this actually happened to me as I entered). Liverpool fans also don't sit down during these matches. Not ever. Sigh...

It resulting in me watching the entire game stood up, crammed into the Kop - being pushed, shoved, grabbed and kissed for both of your goals!

I'm a utd fan that lives in Liverpool and once sat in the Kop for a Liverpool Vs Utd game. I was on my own. I stood for you'll never walk alone. Clapped for the goals etc.

I also left 15 minutes early as liverpool battered us haha!

I hope you enjoy London and your 1st premier league game. If you're here for a while do try and see a lower league team as well. It's well worth your time and a very enjoyable experience. I've been to see both QPR and Brentford in London and would recommend both.

I also hope you're able to get to a game in Liverpool some time. It's only a short 2 hour train from London (I make the journey often and it's very easy). My city would welcome you and even as a Utd fan will admit that Anfield is a special stadium to watch a game at."
