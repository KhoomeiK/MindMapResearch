fermentation,fg05q4y,t1_fg02jvh,1580400801.0,Ditto. Have never used ph strips. F1 a little longer in winter when temps are cooler but otherwise I go by taste!
Zoomies,ffzukn5,t3_evzikb,1580393285.0,Lincoln!!
malehairadvice,ffzt9rs,t3_evyyii,1580392253.0,"Lady here... you look way better! Nice! 
A little facial scruf will also add to some hot vibes."
herbalism,ffzst6x,t1_ffzh9g7,1580391879.0,"Yup. Tell her to get a nutritionist if she is struggling with diet. Exercise is also key. If those two things aren’t addressed herbs won’t help enough to get those numbers down.

Also remember most doctors have almost no training in food/diet. In my experience dieticians are ok but an experienced nutritionist will be more open to also using herbs to support."
herbalism,ffzsjfe,t1_ffzmbmo,1580391657.0,Awesome! I do something similar but put it in a spray bottle and just spritz my hair a few times a week with it or whenever.
herbalism,ffzsesd,t3_evzz56,1580391549.0,"Oh you can grow SO much in CAnada! Where do you live?

I work on a farm in the PNW and we grow calendula, lemon balm, anise hyssop, bee balm, mint, rose, tulsi (holy basil),
rosemary, chamomile.
You can also forage for at johns wort, nettle, fireweed, wild rose, arnica, plantain etc."

herbalism,ffohppf,t3_eubsvh,1580077686.0,Can you add it to a smoothie? That’s what I do and you can’t taste it.
powerlifting,ffmcu93,t3_eu4wo9,1580052552.0,Thanks for posting!
herbalism,ffma7x0,t1_ffm82w7,1580051330.0,Oh sorry you said juice. In juices fiber is removed. If it's a blended drink with whole fruit then it will remain. Depends on what is used.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,ffm4drz,t3_eu2zre,1580048278.0,Oh jeez too cute
herbalism,ffm2jv2,t1_ffkvjg7,1580047530.0,"Fruit juices wouldn’t be my go to. Some can be very acidic. They are also pretty high in sugar. The difference between juice and whole fruit is you get rid of the fibre which is good for you and slows digestion and reduces sugar spike effect. 

Cabbage juice is supposed to be great. Also bone broths are healing. As for herbs licorice and marshmallow are healing. I would also make sure you get good probiotic foods, ideally made at home. Remove all processed foods, alcohol and coffee. Address stress and anxiety.
Good luck to you!"
AskMen,ffi9uct,t1_ffi3mvn,1579968770.0,Ha true! I reserve my glitter antics for my god kids and construction paper (that sh*t gets on everything).
AskMen,ffi9qc2,t1_ffi5hvy,1579968691.0,Ya that’s what I assumed. He did make me cry a lot though.
AskReddit,ffi0i6z,t3_eto99o,1579961330.0,"Because I wasn’t particularly interested in guys wanting me to look/be different, to be less myself. I also did not know or like myself very well until maybe 5 years ago. 

I also didn’t have the skills to communicate my needs or even understand what they were. 


Older and wiser now. Still single but way better positioned to enter into something while still being able to be me and say what I need and want. 
It’s a process...and I never felt the need to just be in a relationship unless it felt right."
Fitness,ffi00qx,t3_etn33x,1579960860.0,"Most gyms have an intro rate so you don’t have to commit right away. Try out a whole bunch in your area and find one that suits your needs.

Personally I workout at community centres. Nothing fancy but the equipment is there, it’s cheap, people are
 chill and most people seem to want the cardio machines! If the few racks are busy, there’s a signup sheet or I just ask how much longer they think they will be. No problems."
Fitness,ffhzuzo,t1_ffhzqbv,1579960701.0,"Swap in in between sets. They do one set and while they rest you do yours. 
It works well if you’re doing a similar exercise but if one person is on bench and you wanna squat super heavy it might not."
toofers,ffhzdok,t3_etqctf,1579960218.0,If there are more like this we’d like to see them!
AskMen,ffhz3pv,t1_ffhmrb1,1579959935.0,I had a bf once who said he liked it when I cried. Never figured that one out.
AskMen,ffhymlm,t1_ffhmlcu,1579959443.0,"I live in a place where outdoor activities is a huge part of my life. So often am makeup-free.  This is usually how I meet guys so it’s kinda nice to not have any expectations! 

When I do wear some it’s minor but makes me feel bomb. Meanwhile I’ve dated guys who look at me weird when I have tinted lip gloss on and say “whoa!! Crazy makeup”. 

You cant please everyone so I please myself instead and let the cards fall where they may!"
herbalism,ffhy4ds,t1_ffhv4u9,1579958907.0,"All the articles I’ve seen talk about risk factors, not causes. I get I may be splitting hairs here but it’s an important distinction. 

There are many risk factors, a primary one being h pylori infection. But many people w h pylori don’t develop ulcers and there are many (I think 20-25%) with ulcers and no h pylori infection. Overuse of nsaids is also a big risk factor. 

There is an underlying susceptibility in the mucosal layer of the stomach (or colon/small intestine in the case of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease) that makes a small percentage of people more prone to ulcers.

Here’s [one article ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6406303/) that’s a decent review and also talks about medicinal plants including ginseng, garlic, gjnger, green tea etc. 

[Here is another summary article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6140150/)  from 3
2018 that discusses risk factors. 

I’m not sure if peptic ulcers are considered autoimmune (I think some might) but ulcerative colitis and crohns are so for those that’s a whole other thing."
herbalism,ffh5agg,t3_etlhdr,1579923504.0,Topical or oral? I like oil infused with cannabis and arnica.
