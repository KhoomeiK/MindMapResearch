I know it's hard, but you really need to try harder to be grateful. Start with something simple...you're grateful that you're able to walk. Hold that feeling.

You're grateful that you are able to see. Hold that feeling. BE that feeling.

Keep rapid firing all these small things you are grateful for and you'll literally rewire your brain.
