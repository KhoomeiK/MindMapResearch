survivorsofabuse,ffpw8au,t1_ffpw1w1,1580108143.0,That’s a good way to put it. That should be on a protest sign somewhere...
survivorsofabuse,ffpgc0t,t1_ffp98w1,1580094354.0,"That's so disgusting to me. I don't know people can deny it.

And I don't believe reporting is about strength, so please don't ever blame yourself for that! You're strong just for surviving."
AmItheAsshole,ffoig2e,t3_eu8f1b,1580077944.0,"NTA. However, it sounds like your cat might have eyesight problems... running into things, missing targets, etc. You should get his checked out!"

FosterAnimals,ffhag0i,t1_ffh9yp8,1579927869.0,"Unfortunately cow milk can cause severe gastrointestinal problems :( that is probably why he is so inactive/not wanting to eat. at this age there’s not a very good chance he will make it without a species appropriate formula. Can you order it online? In a pinch, kitten formula will be much better, if you have access to that. You may also want to offer him some fruit/veggies in case he’s old enough to eat solids. 

Even if he’s sleeping, he has to be woken up to eat and go to the bathroom. I worked at a wildlife rehab center, so let me know if you have any other questions. In the meantime, just keep him in a very warm, dark place so he can either heal or pass away peacefully."
FosterAnimals,ffh9uq4,t1_ffh8vpw,1579927333.0,"Keep trying to stimulate it. At this age, they’re unable to go without the stimulation. Are you feeding it formula? Or cow milk? 

Lastly, do you have a wildlife rehabber in your area? You may need to contact them. Licensed professions are his best chance to survive. Good luck."
FosterAnimals,ffh81ux,t3_etfxc5,1579925758.0,"Baby mammals NEED to be stimulated every 3-4 hours to use the bathroom, or else they can die of toxicity building up in their bloodstream. In the wild, their moms do this by licking the genitals. This can be done with a damp cotton ball/piece of toilet paper, and just gently rub over the genitals for about 60 seconds until they pee/poop. This is extremely important, even if he appears to be going on his own. It can be deadly if you don’t do this!!"

AmItheAsshole,fes0lh1,t3_eqejg8,1579360202.0,YTA. Don’t give 16 year old girls things YOU would want. Give them things they ask for.
relationship_advice,fen9tvj,t3_epzone,1579280096.0,"I am an animal lover myself. I foster kittens and work at an animal shelter while I’m in school. I couldnt imagine NOT having 4-5 foster animals at a time on top of my own pets, and this isn’t something I’m willing to compromise about myself. It’s literally the thing that makes me happiest in the world. If this is truly his passion, maybe you aren’t compatible. He’s getting all the aquariums because they’re the only animals he’s permitted to have besides the cat. 

I think you should revisit the conversation you had when you decided you would only have 1 cat and come up with a middle ground. If you aren’t willing to deal with his passions and he’s not willing to give up his passion, maybe you aren’t compatible. Personally, I would not want to be with someone who didn’t support my work with animals. Nothing against them- they’re just not for me. Not sure if I’m proud or embarrassed to admit I would choose my animals over a partner... lol"
relationship_advice,fek8qir,t1_fek5k7x,1579194955.0,"My boyfriend would be so supportive if I wanted to spend 2 months traveling. I get missing your SO when they’re away but missing them should never make you want to hold them back. If he really hated her being gone so much, why not join her? Or meet her for a week somewhere, if he can’t leave for the whole 2 months? That’s what I do when my boyfriend travels to his home country."
relationship_advice,fek0v1r,t1_fejyz0n,1579190205.0,Agreed lmao
relationship_advice,fejvx5t,t3_epfbkr,1579187078.0,"I’m going to go against the grain here and say that she didn’t leave YOU for a summer- she just went traveling. I’m guessing y’all are young and she wanted to travel and see the world before she settles down. And she didn’t tell you last minute- it was in the spring, and she didn’t leave until the summer. 

If you had any reason to believe she cheated, then I would totally understand. But you guys were still together while she was gone, and talked regularly. 

Have you tried talking to her about this? Telling her how much it hurt you and broke your trust, and just ASKING her what happened on the trip? Honestly it sounds like she hasn’t given you any reason to think she cheated on you. If you cheated on her during that time, that’s on you, and you should tell her because neither of y’all ever said you were on a break. It was NOT a break in the relationship, so don’t assume she cheated, but also don’t assume that what YOU did doesn’t matter. 

Im in a long distance relationship so i get that sometimes it FEELS like my partner is leaving ME when he leaves, but that’s not the right way to think about it. Traveling =/= abandoning you. She was only gone for 2 months and if she really told you about it in the spring, then it wasn’t last minute. It was months in advance. One summer apart after 6 years together isn’t a huge deal."
