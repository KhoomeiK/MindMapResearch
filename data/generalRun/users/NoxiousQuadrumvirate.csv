It’s something to keep in mind because if you’re only interested in a PhD in order to do physics as a job, you are very likely to fail in that regard and to be disappointed.

Universities only avoid firing their tenured faculty because providing actual evidence takes effort and they can't be bothered to go through that process or to hire new faculty in his place, which would take months and cost a lot of money.

ApplyingToCollege,ffhuodn,t3_etnern,1579954746.0,"There is more competition for higher degrees by research (HDRs, e.g. PhD and research Masters). As your group moves through the years, *you* will increase the competition even more. People in your year group already have publications, and so by the time you're applying to graduate programs, quite a few applicants to top programs will have quite a number of publications. When I applied, most of us had 1-2 from undergrad and none from high school, on top of ~4.0 GPAs. Even that is considered quite extreme compared to the expectations just 5 years earlier. 

But it's not toxic. 

When you apply to an HDR, you're not really applying to a university or even a department. You're applying to work with a specific group of people on a specific field of interest using your specific set of background tools and knowledge, and it's actually pretty rare that two applicants will have exactly the same interests and the same approaches. You're applying for a position that exists only for you, and if you are turned down, no one else takes your place. Even if someone is accepted to the exact project you were rejected from, they've been accepted to work on that project using their unique skillset and it will look very different to if you had done the project. 

They do have limited space and PIs can only take on X number of students, so you do have to prove that your proposed research with your skillset is worth pursuing more than those proposed by other applicants. Stats are only one very minor part in your application so it's really impossible to judge any other applicants. Performance in interviews, personal statements, research proposals, and letters of recommendation are all far more important than other metrics, and they're also the metrics that you can't judge in another person. That's why graduate admissions often look *more* random - the information you know about other applicants is mostly useless junk that doesn't really have a huge bearing on their admission or rejection."

After listing the local community college as one of his options, she responded with a retort of “Wait, are you serious?” He was. She worries that friendship will never be the same. Understandably, we might feel surprised that some actually consider attending the local community college.

It sounds like the “Bunker Hill Community College joke” is actually them joking that they'll apply/attend there. There's no mention that Andover students are banned from applying. If anything, this mindset is probably the precursor and the reason why they all decided to apply to that specific CC as a joke - because it was already a sort of joke."

college,ffhpeal,t1_ffg8nac,1579946820.0,"I'm sorry to say, but your plan as you've put it here is just kinda trash and it's very likely to fail. Why? Because you have very solidly proven that you lack intrinsic motivation *and* any shred of self-discipline, and your current plan relies solely on **both**. It's like trying to punch yourself with no arms.

I'm not trying to drag on you here, it's just that intrinsic motivation and self-discipline are not things you can have an awakening to. You cannot go from 0.0 to 4.0 worth of those qualities in under a term, and the people who appear to do so actually already had those qualities, they just had something like depression, grief, addiction, etc holding them back. You have *no* excuse like that, you simply lack those qualities and you will need to build them up over **years**. So your plan needs to account for your lack of those qualities and succeed without relying on them. 

Once you skip class *once*, it is now in your mind as an acceptable choice and you can never change that. Never. So what in your plan is actually stopping you from skipping all of your classes again? Threat of grades didn't work before and won't work now. You can skip out on a peer mentor, same with tutoring. A schedule is the weakest known force in the universe. Treat yourself like an addict. You are addicted to slacking off. Your willpower to fight that addiction is going to die at lightning speed, so what's going to force you to work when you inevitably decide that, actually, you're okay with another 0.0 term? It certainly won't be a goddamn schedule. 

Good plans are like some of the things others mentioned: getting a therapist and taking all your ""fun"" shit back home. Appointments you paid for are somehow harder to skip than classes. Physically removing distractions, like physically removing drugs or alcohol, can do a lot to help you overcome addiction to them. 

Figure out what *enabled* you to miss class and fix that. I struggle to get out of bed in the morning, so I have multiple alarms that I can't snooze and take caffeine pills first thing when I wake up. I tried to self-motivate myself to get out of bed for a long time but it simply doesn't work if the motivation isn't there, and in the middle of term, in the dead of winter, *the motivation won't be there*. Take your mindset from last term and construct a schedule and set of living conditions so incredibly restrictive and non-negotiable that it would have been physically impossible for old you to have gotten a 0.0.

Harvard can hardly be a great place for me if they have literally 0 people in my field of research.

Many of the jobs in places like NASA and the other big government groups tends to focus on observational astrophysics or instrumentation, or otherwise on theory of objects that can be observed and tested easily. Remember that we don't really have observations of black holes (observations of AGN are not observations of the black hole), so the work is very theoretical and somewhat esoteric. 

So if you go that path, you can assume you will work at a university and you will be teaching there at least part time, or you will not be working in the field because you couldn't find a job. The outreach work I do giving public lectures isn't a part of my job because I don't work as a science communicator, I work as a research astrophysicist studying black holes. My payment comes from research and teaching at the university level. I give the public talks for free in my own time because I want to. Teaching within the university is a near-daily thing, on the other hand.

Typical research vesus teaching load might be 50-50 or 70-30 etc. Going 100% on either is not common, so you need to be happy doing both to some degree, although research takes precedence for this field."

Professors in astrophysics do teach, but the majority of astrophysics classes are at the upper level, meaning they're only taught at 4-year universities (in the US), and so a teaching-only or majority-teaching contract is going to be very rare. The main job is to do research. Teaching is often required to some degree but is rarely the thing that advances a career in astrophysics. 

If you want to study black holes (my field), then you are looking at possibly the most mathematically intensive field within astrophysics. In that case you can't just ""get through"" the maths, you ideally need to be double majoring in it and you need to ace it.

Take your most recent test to your teacher, sit down with them, and work through the things you got wrong. Identify where you typically make mistakes. Are you failing to read the question properly? Do you make silly mistakes in arithmetic? Are you getting the units wrong? Then when you study, go far beyond what the question asks for and make sure you have all the information laid out correctly. If the final worked solution takes 1 page, then your working and extra derivations should take 5.

As long as any reasonable adult human can see the reference, that may be enough, no block quotes needed. 

I can **guarantee** that neither the authors nor the publishers give a shit though. Authors only care if you're passing the work off as your own e.g. by submitting it to another journal, since we don't earn money from them regardless of how you access it. Publishers only care if you release the full document to the general public, and even then they may or may not do anything about it."
AskAcademia,fenf87c,t3_eq2zc1,1579283407.0,"Unlikely, especially if he’s an author on the papers. Authors are allowed to provide the full paper, sans journal formatting, to individuals as much as they please. I’m sure they can post excerpts of their work too. The plagiarism police aren’t gonna come tear them down if they’ve made a reasonable attempt to give attribution (ie some lines at the beginning explaining the work and providing the access link) and are not providing access to an extraneous fraction of the paper. It’s a blog post. It falls under the purpose of commentary or criticism. As long as the source can be followed, people/institutions are generally happy enough."
