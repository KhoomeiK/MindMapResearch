For me I really struggle complimenting my daughter on how smart she is. I want her to value trying and her intentions more than how smart she subjectively is. I have found that telling a child they are something (smart, fat, skinny, bossy) leads to them using that language internally and either combatting it or leaning on it. A 'smart' child doesn't have to try for the A they just get one. The skinny child doesn't have to eat nutritious food because they are already skinny. 

Well what happens when university or puberty happens and all of a sudden a fast metabolism doesn't burn 500 calories in a sitting or that A doesn't get handed to her? She never had to cultivate good habits because she innately just had the outcome.
