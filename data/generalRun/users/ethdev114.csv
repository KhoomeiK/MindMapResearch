DnDGreentext,fc7ltvv,t1_fc5hwc9,1577511643.0,"That's not correct. IQ is mean 100, standard deviation 15. INT is mean 10.5, standard deviation 3. The calculation should be INT x 5 + 47.

20 => 147

11 => 102

10 => 97

7 => 77

5 => 67

If he reaches maturity by 90, the actual process of going from knight to master is social, so it can happen in 10 years for yoda just as easily as it did for anakin or obi-wan. He won't age to be as old as the other masters in that time, but he'll still be a master."

Supporting it publicly while also joining the coalition promising to stop it was the biggest difference in this most recent election. The smear campaign existed then too.
