BPD,fcadszs,t1_fc09fva,1577567529.0,"I had the same thing really badly, couldn't speak properly, couldn't form sentences on the fly, had to stop and think for a few moments to remember what I was saying, and it turned out that Oxcarbazepine was slowing my brain down. I'd also like to mention that I haven't ever had alcohol or any drugs aside from my prescribed medications. Now I'm off of it and doing slightly better with mental agility. Not great, and not close how I used to be with memory retention or vocabulary, but better with forming sentences and having coherent strings of thoughts. If you're on any medications, I'd check for websites that have a full expanded list of possible effects.

Of course another big part of it is being really scatter-brained now and constantly trying to weigh and consider a ton of things about what I'm saying or trying to convey, and second-guessing all of it. And that is its own issue"
