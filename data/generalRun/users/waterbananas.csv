Teachers,fex1y3n,t3_eqr56p,1579422993.0,"There was a time a humongous wasp flew into my classroom through the second floor window and I nearly shat my pants when it flew a few inches in front of my face. Luckily instead of my entire class laughing at me, they were also all screaming and we were all scared together. Good times..."

ABA,feg3ze5,t3_eob2ui,1579075877.0,"You lasted longer than me, I quit in 5 months and one of my co-workers who started the same time as me quit last week. I don’t have advice to offer you. In my case once I realized that this field isn’t for me and my passion was running low, the quality of care I gave to my clients suffered. I didn’t have much energy and couldn’t be as creative and motivated to work on the programs. I realized that quitting would be better for my clients so that they could have someone who is more passionate about the field work for them. So for me, quitting was the right decision."
