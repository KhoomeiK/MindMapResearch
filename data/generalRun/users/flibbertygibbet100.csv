Blaming someone else when it's your own fault is a character flaw. I would absolutely take them to court otherwise you'll never get a thing back from that family."

entitledparents,fc4zum2,t1_fc3el9q,1577435866.0,For me it's teaching my nieces and nephews how to make an acorn cap into a whistle. It's really easy and really loud. I just wish I lived in an area with bigger acorn caps. Where I like it's all live oak and the caps are smaller than the ones I used as a kid. I can use the small ones but it's easier to learn on the bigger caps.
