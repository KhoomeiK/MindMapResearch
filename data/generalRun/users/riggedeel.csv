My advice is appreciate the fact that you have the ability to pick between the two, not stress one bit, and buy the one that feels right.  Different conversation if you were paying same money for 100% markup big box store products that sucked.  Think it through as much as you can, but bottom line is you are gonna get a great advanced pellet grill for your money and the important thing is to learn how to cook on it.  That is the fun part!"
pelletgrills,ffgf5ok,t1_fff76ya,1579904854.0,"I got the Silverbac Alpha a few months ago and love it.  Have called customer service twice, not for problems but technical questions and had great service.  I’ve cooked maybe twenty times going low and slow and also full blast.  Tend to use the traditional mode most of the time but the PID is super valuable when needed.  

I have never used a Rec Tec but given the great things people say about them I can only say my experience with Grilla mirrors theirs.

The thing is a tank.  I suck at putting stuff together and it went together practically by itself.  Everything fit perfectly.  

Not saying it is better than a Rec Tec just saying I would recommend it highly.  Nice choice to have!"

jerky,fetq98g,t1_fetnc4m,1579378314.0,Thanks milkman.  I have done it at 180 and really like the results.  I used to have a different brand of pellet smoker that ran cooler and that jerky seemed more similar to the dehydrated style.  Both are extremely good.  I just figured there are some purists here who would consider the 180 stuff a different product and wanted to acknowledge that point.

Problem is I also want a few other kitchen items and while budget is part of the issue, so is space.

jerky,feteezo,t3_eqhg9d,1579374564.0,"I used to have an electric smoker and never got any red color (or smoke ring on ribs etc).  Got a pellet grill and while there is actually quite a lot less smoke flavor the red smoke rings and red jerky are very evident.  I read that the red comes from a hot clean fire.  That is what you get with a pellet grill, even if the fire is quite small.  Somebody else here though can probably offer a much better explanation.

I hope you don’t take offense at my next suggestion but I think it is important for others reading this even if you know it.  You need to be careful with the quantity of curing salt you use.  It can actually be dangerous to diverge from the quantities recommended.  There is a calculator online with lots of info at the amazing ribs website that can explain way better than I can.

The rub uses what looks like a ton of sugar.  He even addresses this in the book and online.  I was skeptical but the combo of that rub and his cooking guidelines made for my best ever batch of ribs by a long shot.  

His new book Meathead is great btw.  Not specific to pellet grilling and is in fact very broad covering grilling and smoking on all types of devices.

One thing I have found is that I need to preheat my oven for a long time to get it hot and stable.  Knob goes to 500.  We have a laser thermometer and I’ve had readings up to 525 or so.  But the oven needs 45 minutes minimum preheating and does better at an hour.  I cook on a basic pizza stone if that matters.

It is also best to give the oven some recovery time between pies.  Not always easy but it does help."
pelletgrills,fcu7xn2,t1_fcu7hp2,1577974682.0,You are welcome.  I recently got a 25 foot GFCI extension cord for my Grilla Silverbac for just this reason. I am also way more careful these days about vacuuming out ashes and checking for grease buildup.  Old Traeger lived on a second floor deck and seeing the hopper smoke was no fun.  Grilla lives in the yard.
pelletgrills,fcu6vr7,t3_eixw94,1577973985.0,"One other piece of advice.  I had a few small fires in my old Traeger, mostly due to insufficient cleaning on my part.  I would have hated to have a fire while I wasn’t nearby.

If the grill is well away from any structures then you are only risking a grill but if it is five feet from the house I would not run it unattended especially after cooking something with that much fat already rendered.  

These grills are very safe and I am not trying to cause undue alarm.  They are still machines and even great ones like RecTec can have problems.  That hopper of pellets contains a ton of potential energy."

I will go back to lower heat like 225 next time bs the 350.  This was good but ends were overcooked.  I also felt like 130 was high for our tastes.  I have historically pulled too early like 123.  Next time maybe 126.  

It was still a delicious meal and we felt very fortunate we could afford the roast comfortably this year.  That isn’t always so.
