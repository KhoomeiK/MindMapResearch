todayilearned,fdduir8,t1_fddtwdb,1578324308.0,"Yes that might be true, but it takes time for any soil to form for trees to grow

  


When talking abor reforestation in Iceland the emphasis is on forming a layer of soil and preventing erosion, no tree grows on barren rocks or sand, volcanoc or not, with heavy winds and rain and frost/thaw bearing down on it"

pathofexile,fcm7dzu,t1_fcm4gq2,1577766172.0,"That's all you were arguing for, and all I was arguing for as well.

As I remember it, you started this whole ordeal arguing that it was way more efficient to work the mechanic manually instead of ignoring it, all I wanted is for you to really acknowledge that it's not more efficient, except if you count in Sirus's per day. Which is ridiculous.

It's not more efficient to conscientiously avoid and act on mechanics all the time than to just simply ignore it. Time spent on ignoring is brain power gained on not playing stupid mechanics. I'm done arguing this."
pathofexile,fcm43ft,t1_fcll3zi,1577763724.0,"Actually the one doing it faster is not doing it more efficiently, neither is wasting resources.

Doing it faster only matters if you are farming, where productivity matters as well as efficiency, because your aim is to to do them x-times per day.

I do it one time a day, using the efficient method described in the OP video.

You do it one time a day, using the effective method you describe which cuts out maybe minutes out of the fight. It didn't matter the slightest for me, we both did one per day.

Obviously in the span of hours, 2-5 minutes are negligible, especially when it cuts out mechanics that could otherwise ruin your attempt if you don't know them. It only matters if you are farming, and even then you can't farm this boss to the point that even 5 minutes matter to anyone but the most ardent and willing of players."
pathofexile,fcll3d7,t1_fcl18r8,1577750305.0,"I'm willing to sacrifice 2 minutes of time to save 10 hours of time. That is efficiency, I'm not proficient with the mechanics, I don't have the time to spend to learn them by myself, I'm willing to spend 2 minutes to save 10 hours. Enough."
pathofexile,fclkxw4,t1_fcl1bu6,1577750202.0,"You are doing it efficiently if you are not dying and you are killing him. Dying is a waste of time, bricking is a waste of resources, I'm willing to sacrifice 2 minutes for efficiency."
pathofexile,fckz7ue,t1_fckxerz,1577736359.0,"But I have to correct you, you have a lackluster understanding of efficiency, which has to do with waste, and mixing it up with productivity or effectiveness."
pathofexile,fckypkt,t1_fckxerz,1577736044.0,"So then you did that, hooray, you are able to farm Sirus.

Now let us do this fight efficiently while you speedrun it."
pathofexile,fckxa9w,t1_fckoegw,1577735175.0,"Well, actually yes my comment makes more sense for someone who actually understands the fight.

They would take the extra time to do the mechanics right, thereby not bricking or dying, because they didn't rush things or run around like a headless chicken.

Efficiency is not the most speed achieved, it's the most waste avoided."
