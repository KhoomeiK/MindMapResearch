MurderedByWords,ffe4bjg,t1_ffe0pbr,1579836342.0,"see that another thing, As an Australian you are right we do pay more taxes ... on average about $3000 a year 

but that should not even come into the equation as take of the cost of insurance you are already paying far less even if you receive no medical care.

but also that extra tax we pay is not just healthcare ... it is also things like schooling, the average HECS ( our student loans ) for higher education is about $20,000 ( there are some exceptions like a Bachelor of Medicine will give you a HECS debt of around $300k )

800+ a month for decent insurance so $9600 a year

Let's say on average if your healthy you visit doctor 4 times a year and get labs everytime

With co-pays $860 add 9600 = $10,460 a year

And by using your numbers for no insurance for 4 doctor visits is $4,000

While it's not going to win any awards it's a good little light hearted movie that is a nice introduction to the hitchhiker Universe if you are one that finds books hard to swallow without some former knowledge of what it's about

Also there is a series as well if you into the old school feel of something like the first 3 seasons of original doctor who but comedy it is worth a look 

All I am saying is book is best but it's enjoyable no matter the medium ... So long and thanks for all the fish"

AskReddit,fdfz14k,t1_fdfylqr,1578374264.0,"thanks that really is a confidence booster, honestly never did well in school and my spelling and punctuation leaves much to be desired ... but something i have been actively working on improving.

I am always up for a verbal debate as i love them but comments like yours give me hope my written one is improving."
AskReddit,fdfwnhy,t1_fdfvoix,1578372226.0,"ok where to start with this ridiculous reply

was never referring to OP i was talking about your single comment alone but saying you assuming i wanted them to be under age was you reading between lines that where not there.

ill give you i was basing kim being 13 of the Australian highschool system but seeing as the first episode she was a freshman and a quick google tells me the common freshman age is 14 please tell me how that is ""never close"" to 13 

and if you can make a solid argument using my comments alone and not any twisted interpretations of what you clearly want it to mean that i was ""clearly going out of my way"" then i will paypal you $50 right now for being so wrong 

its clearly you who want me to be talking about sleeping with underage characters when i was just talking of a moral dilemma   who you chose in your own comments plays no part in it  

but please do go on focusing on underage aspects as clearly that is what interests you"
AskReddit,fdfurb8,t1_fdfugmm,1578370747.0,"seems like you are projecting a bit there as literally no where did i infer that ... in fact i suggested given a choice i would choose an older character and take the money and never said i would take up on the offer if the character was underage.

but you do you if 600k is worth it to you"
AskReddit,fdfsa3j,t1_fdfrgga,1578368951.0,"if we are going to go down this weird path of deep discussion on this then interpretation of OP's original question plays a big part.

if ""the last t.v you watched' means just a character from that show then you are in the clear ... but if they are saying you have to sleep with them from the literal episode you just watched then chances are you are considering sleeping with a 13yo cartoon character for 600k.

or another more tangible but still make believe  example lets go the harry potter movies and Hermione Granger... if you could sleep with Hermione Granger ( not Emma because who wouldn't go there) from anytime in the potter universe clearly you would choose 19yo Hermione Granger from deathly hallows, but if it has to be from movie you just watched and that happens to be philosophers stone then your in a bit more trouble"
AskReddit,fdfnd3f,t1_fdfjbdf,1578365692.0,"Meh kims age is never revealed but on shows completion she is at least 17 but more likely 18+ 

Overlooking the fact that she is just a cartoon 17+ is legal or legal with restrictions in most the world.

So I guess it just matters how early of an episode they were watching and how old OP is"

australia,fddh12v,t1_fddglvc,1578311913.0,"nepetalactone is the drug that cats react to in it ... but world wide only about 50-75%  (depending on area) have a susceptibility to nepetalactone.

turns out just by luck a large amount of 'breeding stock' cats first introduced to Australia lacked this susceptibility ... so roughly only about 5-10% of cats in Australia will react to it 

think of it like humans with peanut allergies"
educationalgifs,fddgkov,t1_fddfiv0,1578311344.0,"not a beekeeper and only making guesses but ... sugar water would have about the same consistency as nectar, and i believe that bees always choose nectar over pollen if it is abundant enough 

when going for pollen they squash it onto their legs and peel it off back at the hive ... then chew it up spit it out then evaporate the moisture 

sugar granules are hard pollen is soft ... the bees may not be able to chew it and even if they can they would not be able to transport anywhere near as much and it seems like so much extra effort when the human can just mix it with water to begin with

now i will say i have no knowledge in this area but am also somehow confident that i am like at least 70% correct"

PublicFreakout,fddetyt,t1_fddec8y,1578309027.0,"often i would agree with you but seeing as in this case the fires are going to be burning for a least 3-4 months more (while maybe not as large or devastating they will take that time to be fully extinguished) and an extra 4-5 months for a group of bogans holding a grudge to stir up a crowd into a frenzy in not out of the realms of possibility.
