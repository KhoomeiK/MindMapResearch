cats,fd0nzy5,t1_fd0liwq,1578121441.0,"His hormones should be gone by now... but good they're both fixed.
Then it's definitely behavioural! I'll see if I can find any useful links or stuff for you. But look up Jackson Galaxy - often has great advice. And try simply googling - why does my cat pee on my bed."
cats,fd0id6w,t1_fd07zqq,1578119230.0,"Yes it could be that he doesn't like the rejection. Or is jealous of your attention towards Inara?
Are they both spayed/neutered? This is very important!"

cats,fd061tw,t3_ejs101,1578114163.0,"OK so you've ruled out a health issue, so that's positive. How many cats do you have? Usually it's to do with territorial marking and because the cat doesn't feel safe or comfortable. If there are other cats and he's peeing on the bed, it's a way of marking YOU as HIS. 
If there are other cats, he's feeling threatened and you need to separate them and keep them that way for a little while and do the slow introduction from scratch.
If he's an only kitty, he's feeling insecure. Perhaps try him in his own room for a few weeks (max 3-4) - with all of his belongings in there. Then take out some of his belongings and rub his scent everywhere before letting him explore further. 
I hope that helps..."
