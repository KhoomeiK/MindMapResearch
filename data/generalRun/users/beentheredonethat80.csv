WhitePeopleTwitter,fgrozv2,t1_fgqtc9t,1581052817.0,"I too came down with b12 deficiency. Boss, spouse and I all thought I was having a mental breakdown. Ended up in a 30 day out patient program, learned many things during that program about myself and mental health overall. 

Doctors couldn’t figure out why any of the medications were not helping. About 20 days into the program and several blood tests they found out I was not bi-polar but instead B-12 deficient. 

The next day on the way back to the program I became very ill and couldn’t stop getting sick on the side of the road. I had to have someone come get me and my car. I just figured I came down with the flu and rested for a few days since I was on a 30 medical leave from work. 

The day I was suppose to return to work I was rushed to the hospital for some symptoms and they rand some test...I had Monotonous and I was 32 years old. It took me nearly 3 months to recover from mono as an adult, totally missed close to 40 days of my life from sleeping. It was weird while I began getting better starting with being awake 5 hours a day, that was huge deal. 

After 4 months of medical leave I was finally able to return to work. I work for a small family owned business. I am still employed there and this July will be 17 years at the same job. Honestly if I worked anywhere else I would have been replaced."

AskReddit,fgei1ze,t3_exvrzj,1580699993.0,"My boss loves pranks, especially ones he gets to watch play out. We decided to tape an air horn to my coworkers chair because he was a complete twat waffle that morning. That day became a two for one, we set everything up and tested it for full success. 10 minutes later the phone ran and my boss went to my coworkers station grabbed the phone and sat down scaring the shit out of him. My coworker returns from lunch and boss and I walk to his station to ask a question about a particular file, we step back and smile at each other watching coworker having a seat. Without fail he sat down and jumped up with rocket speed, he checked his chair for a good six months following that. 

Two weeks ago same coworker decided to be an ass so the boss sent me out to plant a surprise behind coworkers front tire. As my coworker exits the building we run to the door and wait...as soon as he went into reverse there was a loud bang! It was a homemade beefy version of a “popper. He slams on the brakes gets out and searches everything then runs inside where we are now back in our seats like nothing happened. He knew what was up and laughed it off and left apologizing the next day for acting like an asshat. 

Moral of his pranks...you come to work with an attitude you leave with us laughing at you."

AdviceAnimals,ffygfrx,t1_ffx836a,1580345823.0,"So I have a question...not only do I have tinnitus, but also hearing loss in just one ear. BUT more recently do you have sound hallucinations? I hear radio that isn’t playing or the worse police sirens for ten minutes but as I start asking if anyone else hears them I’m hit with a bunch of NO. It’s unsettling and more recently like last 3 years."

AskReddit,ff7h3y3,t1_ff6c2pv,1579649410.0,"Try getting mononucleosis in your 30’s. I slept 4 days straight waking up in the ER hooked up to IV fluids.  My husband made arrangements with my family doctor to bring me in once a week for the 5 weeks I was hit the worse.  Kind of weird missing 2 months of my life due to sleeping, after 6 weeks I could finally manage 3 hours awake at a time.  

Few years later I developed bacterial pneumonia and was admitted to the hospital with 104 fever and woke days later."
