>But that one chip extends over 46,255 square millimeters—more than 50 times the size of any other processor chip you can buy. With 1.2 trillion transistors, 400,000 processor cores, 18 gigabytes of SRAM, and interconnects capable of moving 100 million billion bits per second, Cerebras’s Wafer Scale Engine (WSE) defies easy comparison with other systems.

...

>The WSE’s 1.2 trillion transistors are designed to operate at about 0.8 volts, pretty standard for a processor. There are so many of them, though, that in all they need 20,000 amperes of current. “Getting 20,000 amps into the wafer without significant voltage drop is quite an engineering challenge—much harder than cooling it or addressing the yield problems,” says Lauterbach.
>
>Power can’t be delivered from the edge of the WSE, because the resistance in the interconnects would drop the voltage to zero long before it reached the middle of the chip. The answer was to deliver it vertically from above. Cerebras designed a fiberglass circuit board holding hundreds of special-purpose chips for power control. One million copper posts bridge the millimeter or so from the fiberglass board to points on the WSE."

That's depression. It isn't sadness, rather it's a lack of drive. Talk to your doctor, maybe your medication isn't right.
