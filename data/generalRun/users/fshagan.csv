I get an aisle seat near the bathrooms and get up every hour, if I can. The problem with flying is that you are sometimes prohibited from getting up if weather intervenes. So you have to do the leg and foot exercises sitting in your seat. There are a lot of suggestions about how to do them, but here are the ones I do every hour that I cannot get up: 

* Heel raises: Start with your feet flat on the floor, lift the heels off the floor, then back down.
* Hip flexion: Lift one leg off the floor, knee bent. Lower the leg, then lift the other.
* Hip adduction: Place your purse, an airline pillow or even your hands between your knees, squeeze and hold for 5 seconds. Relax.
* Hip abduction: If space permits, spread your knees as far apart as possible. Hold for 5 seconds. Relax.
* Ankle pumps: Move each foot up and down as if pressing and letting up on the gas pedal of a car. Repeat 10 times with each foot. If you can’t extend your leg to do the ankle pumps, do them with the heel resting on the floor.
* Side to side: Move your foot side to side. Repeat 10 times with each foot.
* Toe curls: Without moving your heel, curl the toes on both your feet as if you were using them to grasp a towel. Repeat 10 times."

In classic government thinking, politicians decided marijuana had no medical use, therefore you cannot test it to see if it has any medical use.

People make the mistake of looking at oil and thinking that since the oil cannot penetrate into the tissues, and is stopped by the skin, that the cannabinoids are also stopped. The purpose of the oil, cream or gel is to keep the cannabinoids in contact with the skin, and they do indeed get absorbed deeper.

The spa is actually a sub contractor on cruise ships, and I've never trusted them. Here's what I think happened:

The cruise line will put an authorization ""hold"" on your credit card for a few hundred dollars to make sure you can pay the daily gratuities / service charge and any incidentals that you buy ... it's typically $300 to $500 or so for a 9 day cruise. That's normal and to be expected, and it comes off after the cruise. It sounds like the spa then put a bogus charge on your card for a service you thought was free, and that caused your card with a $1000 limit to be locked. At that point you're effectively locked out of everything. 

Other bad things happened, like your wife losing her phone, that added to the bad experience. But really it all started with the spa's bogus charge. 

Strip your complaint down to no more than four or five sentences and complain to NCL at [https://www.ncl.com/case-submission](https://www.ncl.com/case-submission). Have someone help you write it out if you need to. Something like:

Our card was frozen as the bogus charge remained for three days while customer service worked to straighten it out. This caused us to be unable to purchase drinks above the $15 limit, we missed excursions at the first port due to the card being locked and ....

You know this intellectually, but remember it's nothing you've done, it's not something you ""deserve"" because you hurt someone, and it isn't karma. It's some kind of medical issue that may take some time to resolve. 

Pain and anxiety are very close cousins who amplify each other. I have anxiety that gives me insomnia because I don't think I'll sleep through the night without the pain waking me up. So my stupid mind keeps me up and denies sleep because I might get my sleep interrupted, and then I hurt more. Doesn't make any sense; isn't some sleep better than none? But that's the way we work.

Cruise,fc2s76o,t3_efuebb,1577372492.0,"For the most part, the ship's security is similar to what you would find at Disneyland or when flying. However, there are some important differences if you are used to carrying cannabis or CBD products.

If you carry cannabis in your carry on at LAX for a domestic flight the TSA will wave you through. The policy is to refer you to the local police for any non-travel related infractions, but in legal states they (usually) don't bother with a referral since the LAX police just release you. They may warn you if your flight is to a non-legal state.  

Going to international destinations is different, both in the air and on the seas. If you carry cannabis onto a ship and get caught the DEA will arrest you under federal drug laws. You have limited constitutional rights at any port of entry. There is no 4th amendment protection at the port or on board. They can and will search your luggage, use drug sniffing dogs (I have it on good authority that those dogs have never read the 4th Amendment), search your cabin at any time during the cruise, and allow local law enforcement on board to search your cabin in each port.

MMJ,fc0qn19,t3_efafde,1577297292.0,"For insurance billing, it all depends on what they code the office visit as.

That reimbursement may be less than the visit cost and you'll have to pay the difference. 

And before someone says ""fraud"", it all depends on the policies of the insurance company. If they allow a follow up visit for anxiety every three months, then that is what they allow. If the PCP cannot bill the insurance because of their policies then they should be able to tell you that. 

The prohibition on paying for medical cannabis is not really in play here. The insurance company isn't going to buy your dope for you. But doctor visits for an official diagnosis should be separate from the prescription the doc gives. As an example, I have been given a prescription by a doc that wasn't covered by my insurance, but the office visit was covered.

neuropathy,fbz3jmo,t1_fbkq9bp,1577234000.0,"**Ingredients:**

* 3.5 to 7 grams of cannabis
* 8 ounces of organic (raw African) Shea Butter
* 4 ounces fractionated (liquid) coconut oil

**Procedure:**

Pour the liquid coconut oil in an oven safe Pyrex or other glass baking dish and add the ground cannabis. Allow it to soak at least four hours. I usually let it soak 24 to 48 hours. This allows the oil to absorb the cannabinoids. 

Heat the oven to 280 to 300°F and add the cannabis oil mixture to the oven. Let it bake for 1 hour. This heats the cannabis enough to ""activate"" the THC and CBD. Remove the oil, let it cool and strain the oil to remove the cannabis. I use a coffee filter to strain it. 

Heat the Shea Butter in a double broiler so it melts slowly with even heat. I actually use a mixing bowl that can ""float"" on water in a pan that I heat to boiling. The idea is that you don't want to melt the Shea Butter too fast as it can get ""grainy"" when overheated.

After the Shea Butter is melted remove from heat and pour the cannabis infused oil into it, and stir. Cover with plastic wrap and let it cool and solidify overnight. When back to a soft solid, you can use an electric mixer to whip it and make it a nice consistency. 

This makes about 14 ounces of a thick, peanut-butter consistency cream. 

**Tips:**

1. For ""smell control"" I put the ground cannabis in a tea diffuser and soak it in water overnight. The water soluble chemicals leech out and it doesn't smell as much.  I dry it by spreading it out on parchment paper for a day or so before putting it in the oil. This is optional.
2. I use a high CBD cannabis strain that has about 5% CBD and 8% THC, but ""regular"" THC cannabis will work as well. If you're using cannabis with 18% or more THC you can reduce the cannabis to 3.5 grams (1/8th).  I buy cheap cannabis if I've run out of my home grown strain, and pay less than $20 an eighth for it. 
3. Cooking the cannabis in the oil can be smelly. I prefer to do it in a toaster oven in the garage. I used an oven thermometer to check the oven temp, and found my toaster oven heated to 285°F with the dial set at 300°F. 
4. You can speed up the cooling process by putting the Shea Butter / Cannabis oil mixture into the refrigerator for 30 minutes. However, when I've cooled it too fast it gives it a grainy texture I don't like as much. 
5. If you want to add essential oils like Lavender, use about 6 drops while mixing it up. Don't add the essential oil to the hot mixtures. I avoid the essential oils now because they irritate my skin as I use the cream twice a day. 
6. You can buy Shea Butter on Amazon and in beauty supply stores. It runs $6 to $7 for an 8 ounce tub. Use 100% raw African Shea Butter, not a Shea Butter blend (if it has any other ingredient besides just Shea Butter on the label  the cream doesn't come out well.)
7. You can buy liquid coconut oil in most supermarkets; it is in the cooking oil aisle. I pay about $8 for an 16 ounce bottle of ""Louanna Liquid Coconut Oil""."
vaporents,fbykoov,t3_ef0r4e,1577219345.0,"Weird question, but I'm considering the EQ as my Fury 2 tends to give me hot vapor: Are the bags re-usable? Or are they a one time use type of thing?

I'm thinking I'll probably use the whip if the bags aren't re-usable."
Cruise,fbyk5nv,t3_ef5it8,1577218959.0,"I agree with Carnival, NCL or RCL as good choices for young people. The larger ships have more night life (parties on deck with dancing, night clubs, that sort of thing). 

If you and your friends like sitting around the pool, NCL is a bad choice on their newer ships. The pool area is small and very crowded. If you don't care about the pool, then NCL is a great choice. 

If you like to imbibe on vacation with more than two drinks a day then finding a cruise that includes the drink package has a lot of value; some lines like NCL still charge you the gratuities when you get the drink package for ""free"", but it's $20 a day. That's about two drinks with the inflated drink prices (unless you only drink beer, then it's about three drinks per day). Alcohol is the biggest ""add on"" people who don't cruise often get nailed with. 

Getting to the ship can be expensive too, so think about transportation to the port as part of the expense. If you have a port nearby that you can drive to that will be less expensive than flying in the day before and staying in a hotel. 

Celebrity, Princess and Holland America are more sedate with not much night life in our experience. 

Here are some warnings about cruising that you probably won't need:

**No refunds:** Buying a cruise is a commitment. You have to pay up front and for most cruise lines there is a strict ""no refunds"" policy once you are within their ""final payment"" period (usually 90 days from the cruise). That means you cannot get a refund because you miss the boat, or because you get cancer and are going to die: they simply don't care why. No mercy on this front from the cruise lines.

**No tolerance for drugs:** Cruise lines are in the dark ages when it comes to cannabis or CBD. Even if legal where you live, the ships follow the rules of the countries where they register the ship. You do not enjoy Constitutional protections at sea or in the foreign ports. Even in US ports, you and your cabin are subject to search at any time without a warrant because you are at a ""port of entry"". In the Bahamas and some other Caribbean islands, the police routinely come on board with drug sniffing dogs and enter and search cabins while you are ashore. In the Bahamas, they hold you for court, and you pay a fine. If the ship has sailed away, it is your responsibility to ""catch up"" with the ship at it's next port, or go home at your own cost. Leave the cannabis and other drugs at home. 

**Health insurance:** (I'm assuming you are in the United States here). Check to see if your health insurance covers you in other countries or ""on the high seas"". Many don't. If you go to a country where you don't have health insurance, and end up in the hospital, they will (effectively) imprison you until you can pay. It's your responsibility to get back home after paying the bill if your stay meant you missed getting back on the ship. And if you think American medical costs are high, just wait until you see the rates for ""rich Americans from a cruise ship"". It is not uncommon for a Mexican hospital to charge Americans between $5 to $10 thousand for a broken leg. The one exception where the risk is less is when you get sick near an American port; the US Coast Guard doesn't charge you for medical evacuation and your regular insurance probably covers you anywhere in the US. The Canadians, however, do charge and they are very expensive as well. The ships do have a medical center on board, but it is also expensive - $1,500 for a medical intervention like getting stitches is not unusual. 

Because of your age group, you can probably risk taking the trip without health insurance, but you should be aware of this risk. Many policies combine trip and health insurance, so that if you have to cancel you can get some or all of your deposit back. It adds from 5 to 8% of the cruise fare to your total costs. I recommend getting it from a third party like [insuremytrip.com](https://insuremytrip.com) or [tripinsurancestore.com](https://tripinsurancestore.com) (they have a more personal touch to get answers to questions about pre-existing conditions, etc.)"
ClotSurvivors,fbyhhkt,t3_eetw8b,1577217014.0,"Three more months? My advice would be to listen to your doctors. You almost died and you're worried about being a moderate drinker for another three months?  

I'm a lifer on Xarelto (similar drug) and never drink heavy any more. I love my glass of wine or my scotch when I have it. But I'm not going to let it kill me.  I value my life more than the liquid.

Here's some sobering news:  The CDC defines ""heavy drinking"" with associated health risks for women at [8 units of alcohol per week](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/faqs.htm#heavyDrinking). That's for women that are not on blood thinners. If you normally drink more than that you are a ""heavy drinker"" and it's probably time to re-evaluate your relationship with alcohol. 

Sorry if that comes on strong, but you have medical advice and you might be the type of person who is simply looking for a reason not to follow it. That could be a symptom of someone who values the liquid more than their health. That might not be you, but it certainly could be a hidden motivation to listen to people on the internet instead of your doctors."
ClotSurvivors,fbuobmv,t3_eedamh,1577117745.0,"I don't know if this is technically accurate, but the way the doctor explained it was that the clot becomes like scar tissue; it is hard and attached to the vein wall, and not ""compressible"" so there's no danger of it moving. 

They now think my original clot was misdiagnosed after three months on thinners as [""organized""](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/organized+thrombus) and it recurred 6 weeks after I was taken off thinners. After a year, it was gone, and I went off thinners. Then I had an additional clot in my calf, so I'm on thinners for life now. 

The clot in the calf was not as exciting to the medical staff as the 10"" long clot in my thigh. They definitely got excited about that one."
