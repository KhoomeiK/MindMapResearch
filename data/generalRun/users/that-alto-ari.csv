EmKay,fcmlhvz,t3_ehxdlo,1577780292.0,Suggestion: Do an ok sign logo with some cool pattern on the inside or a monogram or something and then keep the white background or change it

AnxietyDepression,fcirft2,t3_egzvq0,1577668048.0,Why not?
AnxietyDepression,fcil20a,t3_egzvq0,1577664344.0,"I completely agree with you. You should make your own choices. All I’m gonna say is that you could definitely find a mate or friend, even through Tinder, because it’s obviously free and you obviously have a phone. If you can’t find anybody in your life who will love you, you’re gonna need to find one because everyone’s, even your life matters."
AnxietyDepression,fcijrbe,t3_egzvq0,1577663714.0,"I’m like that too. I just have to keep reminding myself, “I have a lot to live for. There are so many people in the world who care for me. If I’m unhappy, the most I can do is to keep others I care for happy.” Staying alive is one of those ways. Think of how sad everyone around you could be. This is gonna sound weird, but if you can, try adopting an animal. Lizards and cats I’ve found are very therapeutic. All I’m gonna say is that if you die, you will be erasing so many memories and experiences from the universe that will never be passed on or shared. Just please, don’t hurt yourself. Find a person who will care for you and make you feel better if you don’t already have one. You might not read this, but if you do, you better goddamn get some love in your life (friendship, romance, family, or other) and do whatever you need to do to feel good."
