And even though the risk is low she might want to look into getting some plan b.  There's also a risk of Sti's.  They should both get tested ideally.  And look into getting on birth control and lots of condoms.  You're a good friend for helping her out.  Hopefully she can learn alot and really take charge of her health.

changemyview,ff848yo,t1_ff803nz,1579665573.0,"A headdress is a sacred item.  End of story.  You're right genocide does not need to occur.  But cultural appropriation taken from a majority (read colonizing) culture from one turned into a minority via genocide as the vehicle is something that needs to be recognized.  I see you are unaware of missing and murdered indigenous women.  (Fun fact a woman went as one for Halloween, and she went viral in the worst way)  Or how Pine Ridge has  some of the lowest life expectancies in the continental us.  It's no coincidence that alot of reservations have poor soil for agriculture, leaving the good soil for the white man.  Let's not even touch the unemployment rate, or abject poverty that racist government systems set in place. How in Canada the Wetsuweten are still fighting pipeline trespassers off of their unceded territories.   How Standing Rock protestors were slandered and subjected to militarized violence for peaceful protest, (that's a recent one) Let's not forget that you could still buy a native child for 10$ in 1952.  The largest mass hanging was the Dakota 38 in Minnesota.  Forced assimilation is a form of genocide.  The residential schools where children were abused and cut off from their culture.  The sixties scoop, where the foster care system was used to break up families again.  Time and Time again the same abuses are repeated in different flavors.  Some more recent headlines being.... A grandfather and grand daughter arrested in Canada for trying to open a bank account.  A TSA agent that grabbed a woman's braids and said they were going to ride her like a horse.  Racism is a form of persecution sir.  And yes, it's still alive and well.     Also I noticed you used the word lived in past tense.  They are not a relict of the past they LIVE here."

changemyview,ff7uz8a,t1_ff7isly,1579658989.0,"Doctor's are not a people subjected to genocide with a legacy that continues to this day.  Dressing as a persecuted ethnicity is not equivalent to a profession.  You can change a profession or aspire to one.  I cannot grow up wanting to be Greek someday.  You cannot change ones ethnicity.  Dressing as a persecuted people who are still persecuted to this day would be seen as tasteless.  Even worse would be to use their sacred item as part of your costume.  Would you dress up as a Rohingha Muslim?  Why or why not?  What about a Bosnian?  Or a Hutu or Tutsi?  Why is one people's culture able to be consumed, profitted off of, and sexualized but not others?"
changemyview,ff7s2dr,t1_ff5jhff,1579656982.0,"I see you're from across the pond, so maybe an American can do this some justice. You are misinformed.  This is like the Native equivalent of blackface, it is that offensive.  I see this argument alot, that 'im sure some don't care because it's not of their tribe so it doesn't matter'. Please take my word as an American, that you would not want to walk onto a reservation with a headdress on.  At best you'd be ignored or banned/ran out. Even if that Nation didn't traditionally wear them they recognize it as sacred and by wearing it you'd be making a huge mockery of that culture.  That's not going to sit well with other Natives.  At all.  Just because you think 'oh there must be one person who doesn't care!'. I'm sure if you really dug hard enough you could find an outlier.  But it doesn't make wearing one right because there's an outlier.  Consensus still stands. And that one outlier guy isn't gonna protect your ass when the bloods come for you.  I grew up in an area with alot of reservations, so take this as a first hand account.  Wearing a sacred headdress is very bad people, end of story. Edited for clarity."
changemyview,ff71bnt,t1_ff6mbc5,1579639154.0,"I'm actually surprised that you couldn't imagine solidarity.  comparing them to European nations is apples and oranges.  Germany and France have vastly different histories and experiences while 2 Indigenous Nations have very similar.  I'm going to assume that you are familiar with residential schools, the sixties scoop, broken treaties, repeated colonizer abuses, trail of tears, the Dakota 38, and genocide of every flavor.  No Indigenous Nation escaped colonizer pain.  Do you personally know any Indigenous people?  Do you attend pow wows?  Even if you look to recent history you see many Nations in solidarity and agreement with Standing Rock.  They officially signed their support for another tribes sacred.  In fact verbatim on the t shirts and banners was 'Defend the Sacred'. There is not a 'not my problem' mentality.  Hell, people even came from as far away as New Zealand.  If thats not support, solidarity and agreement with another tribes sacred then I don't know what is.  I mean don't take a white persons word for it.  Follow some Native Facebook pages, watch some Indigenous YouTube channels.  On mobile, but I don't think you're OP???"
changemyview,ff60yry,t1_ff5ihih,1579616327.0,"Because there is agreement in this particular subject.  It doesn't happen often.  There is no scientific disagreement about climate change.  Even scientists from varied disciplines.  Total scientific agreement doesn't happen often but when it does we should listen.  I prefaced that because alot of times they are lumped into one with no acknowledgement in various issues, and it's important to always keep that in mind.  It may seem confusing if you are far from these issues but accuracy in all aspects is the name of the game here."
changemyview,ff56shk,t1_ff4pvfa,1579581870.0,"All native Americans are not a monolith.  There are over 500 different Tribes/Nations in North America alone, and not all of them had the headdress.  But, even tribes that didn't traditionally have them recognize that it's sacred and not for Halloween costumes or music festivals. Long story short, there is no disagreement, it's wrong.  For clarification, fiance is Lakota.  Don't do it.  Why would it take a full cultures consensus for you to not do it?  Why simply not do it if most of the culture says it's wrong?"
changemyview,ff4mpcb,t1_ff4k9ys,1579567345.0,"In the native American example the headdress is considered sacred and only people who have earned them can wear them.  It's not even for everyone in those cultures.  I doubt you can say that about the clothing you wore in Dubai.  The difference is how the culture views and treats those things.  There may be an equivalent item of stature and importance in Dubai.  But it's important to recognize that distinction.  That being said the best course of action is generally to ask people of that culture if it would be considered offensive to wear it to a party.  It's their culture, they get to decide what's  'regular' and what's special."

TwoXChromosomes,fezph1j,t3_eqphay,1579460024.0,I have to admit that I pity you op.  I pity the fact it took a 'well it didn't/won't/couldn't happen to me' to get you to feel an iota of empathy.  I pity how you were raised and what you were taught.  I sincerely hope that this line of thinking does not extend into other parts of your life as well.  That you would feed or give money to the hungry even if you haven't personally gone hungry or been food insecure.  I hope you use this as an opportunity to grow into a better person and make up for any suffering your beliefs may have caused others.  I hope you feel remorse and tell others your story.  As a decent human being you should not need to go through something bad to feel empathy for others.  It's an overall selfish world view.

""Why would a chronically ill person have children?"" Questions their autonomy as a person, and ability to make life choices that are right for them.  Reproductive choices and how big someone wants their family to be is a very personal subject to begin with.  Do you also question strangers with ""why do you have one child and not two?""
