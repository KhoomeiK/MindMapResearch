Anxiety,ff4xb2n,t1_ff4wys9,1579574676.0,"Your writing is completely fine. :)

Yeah,  issue with Benzos or opiates,  hella addictive,  and anxiety loves them. I had oxy for an injured ankle,  but my anxiety just wants to be constantly numb,  so been struggling,  so using tamazepam,  which helps me cut back,  but now I feel I'm replacing one addiction with another. 

I'll manage to drop both eventually. Just taking longer than it should. I'm hoping i can get into a therapist soon (last place declined me because I was too complex for help :/), which should make quitting easier. I cling to hope,  have for years. But it's still exhausting."
Anxiety,ff4wzl6,t3_erlbp1,1579574458.0,"I minimized by issues with a psychiatrist recently,  it's made me feel worse because I really needed the help. 

A suggestion? Write down everything. Every feeling,  thought,  triggers,  ideas,  negative,  positive,  everything. Write it all down and take it with you. That way you won't shut down and give not honest answers. I should have done that."
Anxiety,ff4wj5w,t1_ff4wbna,1579574144.0,"It doesn't,  but thank you anyways. 
My anxiety leads into panic meltdowns which results hospital visits every few months. Not admitted,  just general,  I'm dying lol help me. I've just started Prozac on top of mirtazepine,  but also tapering off oxy,  using tamazepam, so for a little bit,  I've been numb,  and it's been a nice break."

depression,feoqyzv,t1_feoqiym,1579304275.0,"That's fine,  I get it. Sometimes we internalize so much that when a chance arises,  we over spill and it feels like its an endless supply of issues and complaints. That's why I think therapy could help you,  just so you have somewhere to direct it until your situation changes, somewhere to let it all out,  rather than it eat you inside. I hope you find one soon. That works for you :) and good luck to you for when you can finally walk away from this situation and environment!"

depression,feonlfz,t3_eq5lnw,1579302593.0,"No advice,  but if it's a concern, maybe discuss with doctor that you do not like how it makes you feel,  and would like to try something else."

Secondly; horrible advice, you don't dump your issues on a friend,  they aren't therapists,  which brings me to third; not everyone has the ability,  resources and or financial situation that can afford therapy,  so some of us do what we can to get us through each and every day, which includes memes in reddit."

IFchildfree,fcjqday,t1_fcjo8ff,1577699335.0,"I know,  because ultimately,  it is a pretend ""I'm OK"", because it isn't a choice,  we never had that choice. I'm sorry,  wish there was more I could say to help,  but,  I guess,  I understand because I've been forced into this club too. Eventually it gets easier,  and the grief lessens,  and the moments of loss become shorter, and for that I'm glad."
IFchildfree,fcjmi0y,t1_fcjiuy7,1577693886.0,"It isn't easy,  and I wish society better understood that loss,  that grief. Because it is a loss,  it is a grief,  and it doesn't ever go away. We can only, with time,  find other ways to distract ourselves on our worst days,  so we don't succumb to the despair of it. 

I'm glad you have a supporting husband,  it really helps to have that.  I'm sorry you also have to suffer through this,  but you're not alone. And it's OK to have bad days,  just don't stay there. Xx"

I've had so many casual remarks ""I'll surrogate for you"", without substance,  just out of pity. There are days where I become extremely depressed over it,  but generally,  twenty years later,  I'm OK with it.  I have seven godchildren,  and I adore each one. I'm lucky to have a good family who mostly understands my predicament,  and allows that knowledge to make them aware in what they say and don't say (""adoption""""foster""). 

Fur babies are A-OK in my eyes. Had my beautiful Ebony for 17 years,  she was my baby. I won't replace her,  but I've decided in the months since she left me,  that I'll adopt elderly cats to give them some love before they leave this world."
