I don’t like the idea of being forced to vote for someone I don’t like, but at the same time I see now that our system is built this way and I guess I need to accept it. I feel guilty for my inaction in 2016 considering what a dumpster fire it’s been since."

gatekeeping,fegme5k,t3_ep10zt,1579097166.0,Once when I was a teacher we had the fire marshal doing a walk through. I had these (fire retardant) filters covering my classroom lights to help soften the lighting and I knew that the fire marshal would have something to say about them. I showed him the necessary paperwork and passionately pled my case and he approved them staying up. I said thank you a million times over and before he left my room I raised my arms to shake his hand with both of my hands. He thought I was going in for a hug. I realized he thought I was trying to hug him so I thought the less awkward thing to do would be to just swing with it and hug him. So that’s the day I hugged the fire marshal to say goodbye and thankfully never saw him again.
