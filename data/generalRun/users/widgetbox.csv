vinyl,ffa6vg6,t3_ese9ua,1579729035.0,Our Price! Oh the halcyon days of the 90s...
Jokes,ff7c72b,t3_erzqvf,1579646137.0,So where's the 'spoons in Uxbridge? I know of the Titch in Ickenham...
bravia,ff62gvj,t1_feywls7,1579617458.0,"They said they only  covered bootloop problems and as mine wasn't stuck in a bootloop I could FRO... They helpfully suggested I ""power cycle"" it. Do companies do that to just annoy customers?"
bravia,fezi4v7,t1_fez1zxr,1579457618.0,TBH honest I've not really been aware of anything I was missing - loved the display on the 810C - just wish I could see it :-)
bravia,fezhyin,t1_feywls7,1579457550.0,"Thanks for this - most/all of the reports I'd read online said that Sony basically said you're out of warranty - tough. So will try this as a last go around. Date on that doc is after I had problems so yeh - TVM !  


Yes - love this display which is one of the reasons I've spent months trying to get it to work reliably again.  That and the sheer waste. Especially as I know it's actually working.  


We're moving back to Europe in a a couple of years so any new TV would only be good for that period. I'm not paying out for the latest and greatest."
Leica,fez84fs,t3_eqtjz7,1579454683.0,"Well I only have Leica film cameras so in terms of Leica yes. Still completely practical and in many ways much more fun than digital which still has a place of course...  


One might argue that the enthusiasm of the film community (photographers and suppliers) has probably never been greater."
AnalogCommunity,feyudio,t3_eqm4vt,1579450635.0,Yes deffo give the terminals a good clean. I have an old flashgun with rust free terminals that needed a good clean with alcohol before it would work. Go figure.
AnalogCommunity,feytuar,t3_eqvdtn,1579450431.0,I generally manage to bring the wrong thing.
Cameras,feyqvaw,t1_feygckt,1579449422.0,You need batteries for the meter but they can last year's if you keep the lens cap on. It will work fine with no battery though and just sunny 16 it.
Cameras,feyqdaw,t3_eqwk02,1579449270.0,My 21st birthday present from my parents in 1978. Still have it. Perfect camera to learn the essentials of photography. Gives you access to a huge range of excellent affordable glass too.
SonyAlpha,fepbkr1,t1_fep1ken,1579316530.0,An on my tablet. Love the colour and lighting but she looks like she's had a lot of work done....
aww,fel8zef,t1_fekjq8j,1579216666.0,Probably started managing the company car fleet. Well versed in jumped up sales reps who absolutely had to have the GL trim with a CD player and not some tape deck basic model in a non-metallic colour. Get to know her and actually understand her taste in English holiday destinations and you'd be good to go with metallic trim and that all important SRi stripe on your Cavalier.
AnalogCommunity,feifwie,t3_ep6i04,1579137585.0,"I got whatever is the standard one (but adjustable height) and got the ANR glass. Immediate improvement on the crappy epson ones. I'm scanning 120 .

So improved that I've not really experimented with the height."
sanfrancisco,feie973,t1_fehpam3,1579136474.0,"Speaking as a European I'd have to agree - in terms of cosmopolitan mix, ranges of cultures and attitudes and the sheer diversity of people. It is somewhat smaller which helps."
todayilearned,fefjddl,t1_fee7uk0,1579057554.0,Quite. That and taxes. I booked a ticket today. SF to London Heathrow return. Off peak in Feb but the flight itself was about $260 but taxes and sundry non flight fees added another $270...
Marin,fe33526,t3_enajmo,1578845476.0,Boomer triggered by someone trying to find out how to steal something and probably put people out of a job. Not sorry.
AnalogCommunity,fe319xb,t1_fe14h66,1578844952.0,"I think C41 is actually easier than b&w as the process is so standardized. Once you've got the temperature sorted (a sous vide heater does that job nicely) you're good to go. The only hassle of late has been getting hold of the C41 kits. BTW soda bottles are usually available in 1L sizes. All my chems are stored in Evian bottles. Filtered through mountains and probably organic, lactose free and low calorie :-)

Enjoy your home devving."
sanfrancisco,fdqevxz,t3_emluno,1578664873.0,Friday morning 5am was pretty damn bright too. Casting strong shadows in Marin.
vinyl,fdgsvs9,t3_el49yg,1578407467.0,A Specials album is one of the top 50 selling vinyl releases of 2019... Might be top 25...
CanineMajesty,fdfu5i9,t3_ekwqzi,1578370291.0,I think you're being judged ðŸ˜Š
aww,fdf2wn3,t3_ekxxoo,1578352079.0,"I guess you don't have any racoons around then...

Those little fuckers bang the cats metal food bowls if there's no food in them. Racoons are the cats of the feral animal population."
expats,fdd0a1b,t3_ekim3g,1578289768.0,I was living 6000 miles from my mum when she died. She had alzheimers so in the last few months she didn't know even when I was there. I could get there for the end but it was really to support my sister. One thing I knew. My mum wanted me to be living my life 6000 miles away. I can't speak for you or yours. You have the advantage of being a lot closer so perhaps you can work on a solution that you'll both be happy with.
expats,fd9quan,t3_ekakma,1578236878.0,Born and raised in the north of England. Most of my working life in London area. Currently living in SF Bay area. Planning on retirement in France. Home is still north of England. No plans to live there though. I left there 40 years ago...
AnalogCommunity,fd6684q,t1_fd3v19t,1578186093.0,"Dunno about anyone else but mine was $60 off eBay. Not sure how many actual manufacturers there are in China but quite a few look the same. As for being good - all its, got to do is heat the water. You don't need one with Bluetooth and wifi that's for sure"
pics,fd2fd9g,t1_fd29mpb,1578146412.0,No shortage of castles in Wales. Built to keep the Welsh in check...
SonyAlpha,fd2f0u2,t3_ejtda6,1578146274.0,"My fave local beach, vaguely dog friendly unlike the rest of Marin"
todayilearned,fd2d62x,t1_fd0u0qg,1578145507.0,Or like all Indian food in America then...
aww,fcu1sya,t1_fctegmu,1577969734.0,So true. I losy last grandparent in the 80s but only lost my parents in the noughties. Soooo wish I had a record of their voice. They're always going to be around until they're not.
expats,fct4ndy,t3_eiq6da,1577932772.0,Too bloody right...
Cameras,fc849gb,t3_efoh5s,1577526536.0,If you want an easy and dead cheap ($20 cheap) trial run have a look at wyze. Com and their camera. It does time lapse out of the box.
pics,fby5q87,t3_ef16pa,1577208739.0,"California calling in. We did a raclette evening last week. OK it's not the same as a ginormous cheese wheel and raclette cheese here (when you can find it) is slightly cheaper than gold but hey ho - reliving swiss trips is fun.

Have a good one. We like to have some small potatoes too..."
vinyl,fbwrro1,t3_ees11h,1577157716.0,"Bought ""Check The Oil Dollar Gas"" recently for $6. Not as good as L@TF but you can't have too many live versions of Elizabeth Reed..."
AnalogCommunity,fbsvde9,t1_fbsqozr,1577061277.0,If you get any remjet in your chems you can filter it out with a coffee filter.
