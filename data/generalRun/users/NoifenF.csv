southpark,ffc09sw,t1_ffaw6sy,1579788216.0,I just love how the white people have the shocked uncomfortable expression but the black ones have the angry “don’t you dare” expression lol.
iphone,ffaltov,t3_ernbef,1579738963.0,It’s a shame about my XS. I had the good one. So beautiful but I couldn’t enjoy the damn thing because of the WiFi issue. A whole year of constant turning it off and on repeatedly every day just to do basic things.
lewronggeneration,ff7j3ll,t1_ff7hgna,1579650743.0,"Either that or their MP3 players or iPods. 

People don’t like to interact with people on public transport (at least where I’m from). They just wanna get on with their day. Most you’ll see is a smile if you accidentally make eye contact. 

The public have always ignored each other with *something* on public transport. 

No idea where this artist got the idea they interacted lol."

forwardsfromgrandma,ff60hig,t1_ff5zlph,1579615960.0,Sounds like she just liked the idea of tradition more than anything but wasn’t overtly obsessed with it.

unitedkingdom,fett2gv,t1_fetea80,1579379738.0,Because the EU generally cares about its citizens more than business and capital. It’s not perfect by any means but you only have to look at the rights the EU and we *currently* have compared to the US to see that.
StarWars,fet7uam,t1_ferygju,1579372536.0,">Vader is capable of sensing his son from a different ship in RotJ, but doesn't even get a flicker of connection to his daughter when he's interrogating her in ANH.

He didn’t even know he had kids tbf. Nor did they know he was their father. 

The real plot hole is Vader continually saying he must find Skywalker and then palpatine saying that like is Anakin’s son and Vader being surprised about it. Who the hell did he think he was? It’s just another retro-addition by George where he didn’t look at the previous lines of the film and made it a blunder."

movies,femrk54,t1_fem6zm2,1579267566.0,"Remember how Obi Wan said that Anakin was destroyed when he became Vader? Would it not be the same when Anakin returned?

Now I know the whole “they’re different characters” isn’t a great reason but I think within the lore it makes sense that that’s the reason he was able to be redeemed. Anakin killed palps and then destroyed Vader. He let go of his hate and welcomed the light side."
gatekeeping,feme5mx,t1_fekmvd5,1579250830.0,Charlie’s angels full throttle had really amazing action sequences too. Their fights and stuff actually looked painful and like the punches landed.

freefolk,fejj48b,t1_feir1mm,1579176451.0,He survived silent hill too. Not sure if that’s a win or not.
residentevil,fei6m4t,t1_feejq0h,1579131438.0,He just lost his daughter out there. How dare you imply that he go back outside!
residentevil,fei3xel,t1_fei3pn0,1579129736.0,"Because fifth element holds a special place in my heart. I love her as a badass female heroine (despite her somewhat bland roles). Love her in Zoolander and I just think she’s an awesome person in general. 

Ultraviolet sucked ass though but Milla wasn’t the issue in that film."
residentevil,fei1tt1,t1_feg3y1p,1579128431.0,She’s the only person I can think of in a fight scene that actually acknowledges getting hurt. Like when she gets punched in the face she will grab her nose and her eyes are wide open in shock. Alice is a brick character but I have a soft spot for milla herself so I admit I’m biased.
residentevil,febuwnv,t1_fe8ucr2,1578963030.0,"At one point Sheva asks what happened between the two of them and Chris basically says “we’ve got...history”. 

And that final “CHRISSSS!” Was very much “I can change!”
