CrappyDesign,ffwla0m,t1_ffwe6xl,1580304546.0,"But this speedometer is in kph. The difference between 30 and 35kph isn't as much as 30 and 35mph. And it wouldn't make it very tiny. In this example they go to 220kph which is wildly unnecessary. Like I've said, most top out between 140 and 180 which is more reasonable and allows for accuracy at slow speeds."

Oh and I don't know how much accuracy you really think you're getting at those slow speeds. 60kph is literally 37mph. Mph speedometers handle this pretty well in the 0-40 range. 

Also if you really care about this, look up kph speedometers on Google images. Most of the ones shown do a decent job covering the 0-60 range while still going to the 180-220 range. What's more interesting is that a lot of them don't even seem to care about the higher numbers so much. Most I've seen end between 140 and 180, which makes sense since 140kph is 86mph and 180kph is 111mph."

With that said, there's plenty of better ways to deal with this without changing the scale after 60kph (37mph)."

PaymoneyWubby,feygqhl,t1_fesulid,1579445306.0,"I'll just say this. I don't need to be black to understand you should treat black people the same as any other person. That they are alive and have feelings and have certain inalienable rights. That they are created equal. We're all humans. I don't need to be you to defend you is the concept I'm getting at. 

If you're black, that's great, but it doesn't support an argument that supposes you speak for all people of the same racial background. You can be white or Asian or Hispanic and speak against the use of the ""n word."" 

Your personal experience doesn't matter to an argument bigger than yourself. If *you* don't want to be called the ""n word"" then you can say so and it would be valid to cite your race but still not necessary (because just saying you don't want to be called that is enough). If Wubby or any other person chooses to use those words which society deems to be offensive, it is their choice and whether they should stop relies on intent. 

Wubby's intent is obviously for the sake of edgy humor. It's by no means malicious. So to conclude, if you do not like this brand of humor and it doesn't cause you harm, simply don't partake. And if the intent shifts from humor to harm I'd be the first person in line to put a stop to it. Not because I'm black but because I believe all people have a right not to be harmed. 

I said a lot more here than I originally set out to. I hope this helps."

USPS,feltuxp,t3_eplr57,1579230798.0,"My experience so far has been a good one. My advice is to keep a positive attitude, make safety a priority, and take your breaks. 

Management may push you to get faster and at first you may skip your 10 minute or even 30 minute break to accommodate, but once you're out of your 90 days take all your breaks. You may also feel like being *a little* unsafe to streamline things and be faster is worth it. It's not. Be safe. 

You will get from the job what you put into it. Give a 100% and you'll feel as if you've earned 100%. Give it your heart and soul and it'll feel like it's draining your heart and soul. Find a balance and pace that works for you. Take days off when you need them.
