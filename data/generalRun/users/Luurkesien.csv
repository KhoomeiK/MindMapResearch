So, he can see things passively without even looking.... take that into consideration."

I know how you feel..."

But my party is only level 3 and these Xer Knights are very rare and engage only in time of need.

While the Xer Brand (kingdom's soliders) .... they defeated 6 at once without casualties....."

DnD,fe8bqah,t3_eo19ai,1578924591.0,"How much would a painting with the same level of details as this one would cost?  
It has 4 characters in it: A monk, a rogue, a cleric and a druid, with their particular dress styles. They're in the desert, a dark storm and lightnings(normal ones and some of a reddish color that look like chains), and 3 big eyes (2 normal eyes and one like it's in the forehead rotated 90°) in the sky watching them from behind."
DMAcademy,fe7n6p6,t3_eo2daa,1578916870.0,"Some puzzles I used in my sessions:
1. Room 6 feet wide, 15 feet long and 6 feet tall filled with magical mist that can be dispelled by a strong dispell magic. Or they go prone and see a very small hole in a wall with a button to open for room.
2. There are 3 holes for 3 rocks somewhere. Either wall or the floor. You have 4 windows in a tower, one is yellow which is truth, one is purple which means lie, one is red which is sacrifice and one is brown or grey with is betrayal. The grey one is infused with power word kill at touch. You must touch yellow and tell truth, touch purple tell lie and touch red with a bloody hand to get the 3 stones. Which open the wall or floor for the next area. 
3. I also have made a puzzle related to some paintings, and you had to replicate the things on the painting with the members of your party, in correlation with their backstories. Someone who prays and a priest watching.. so one player has to pray and the cleric/paladin has to watch and something happens or w/e."
