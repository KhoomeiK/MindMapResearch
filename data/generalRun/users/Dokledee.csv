When we want to mail something we oftentimes go to the post-office to drop it in the box, but we also may have a compartment where you put a letter through a slip and it falls into a box where only the postmen/women can access it. Packages also go to the post office but you bring it to the people so they can scan/create a label for you to ship. 

Its only really in rural areas that you have that stereotypical mailbox with the red flag. It goes up when you have outgoing mail and the mail man swaps that out with incoming mail."

offmychest,ff4eey8,t3_eriwgo,1579561642.0,"Weak and insecure people will cut you down for anything to make themselves feel better about their own fucked up life. Every word you said reminded me of my own high-school and college experience where people I hung around degraded me at every chance they could for any slip up in my daily routine. One girl in a university class of mine would always cut me down whenever I studied hard for a test, or even did extra credit- I later learned that she actually had a 84% in the class (96% for me). 

At the final day of class, she mocked me again “oh yEah youre just so smart! I bet you have like a 93% or some insane grade” . I deadass just pulled up my final grades on my phone, smiled, them replied “nah, I have a 97%, but pretty close!” She was fucking horrified and I never spoke to her again. 

I’m a nice girl like you are a nice guy, I love to make jokes and have a good time, but my history of relentless bullying has forced me to grow a nasty side. I’m the nicest thot around but one wrong word and Its over. Instead of cutting yourself down, find people who love you for who you are, and celebrate your achievements instead of ridicule them. Sometimes its the least appealing individuals that have the most beautiful souls. I like how you called out the people who used you, but its better to bite at them before it becomes a habit (not saying thats its your fault, they’re just lazy assholes). Not like a mean bite, but more of a nip like “hey, do your own work, i try hard for a reason, not to be your nanny”

My older brother used to be OBSESSED with princess Leia when he was 4-5, at that same time I was freshly born with hungry ambitions (In other words I was a fat fucking baby).
One car ride, for whatever reason my brother and my mom got into a heated argument over me being a  “princess” like Leia.

My brother argued, saying I wasn’t a princess because I didn’t have a princess name like Princess Leia. To which my mom replied “nu-uh, she does TOO have a princess name!”

My brother: “oh yeah? What is it then?!”

My mom: its prINCESS KIKI- DOLEKOLEDEE

My mom originally wanted to name me Kiki, but everyone gave her shit for it so she named me after Kate Spade. 

My mom and brother still call me Dole from time to time but its only for them to call me that exclusively.

So now for everything including my artist signature it’s “Dokledee” to represent my mom’s love for me."

She had just about the most sever adhd you could find. Like you, she targeted me. Hair pulling, throwing objects, biting/scratching, taunting me and even coming at me to try to hurt me, every day was such a hassle that SCHOOL actually became a safe haven. I tried to reason with my mom but she would say that we had “no choice” since her mom was busy in the military. 

Ill get very serious here, i was about 50-60% set on killing that child. She just about tormented me to my breaking point, to this day even though she has gotten so much better I still get highly irritated and my tolerance is paper thin. 

The only thing I can say is that you just have to find a safe room. Just tell your parents and lock yourself in your room or anywhere when he’s having his meltdowns. You’re only 14-15 and its horrible- i understand, i did the same thing. Your parents are being extremely selfish by ignoring your emotions- but coming from a more matured perspective they’re also trying their hardest. I can only imagine they lay in bed at night wondering what they could have done better, or worse, why they aren’t adequate as parents. You guys just got very unlucky. Mental disorders are very hard with children who are mostly going by primal instincts rather than reason. If push comes to shove just wait until your 18, or find opportunities where you’re not home as often. Im pretty sure your parents will get pissed but by this point its either you or let yourself get permanently affected by it like I did. Save yourself."

Im still quite young, but Im not looking for someone serious until I finish my education - thats my top priority. Both men and women can have the habit of self degrading themselves, rather; its very common amongst us young’ins . I don’t mind when men occasionally roast themselves (I do it 24/7) but I also like it when they go on about a topic or quality of themselves that they’re proud of. It makes me happy to see them love a part of themselves. It lets me know that while they recognize they have flaws they have also recognize they have worth.

So instead of saying “lolol I don’t have a gf, im a total virgin and loser”

Say “I don’t have a gf currently, but I won’t let it get to me too much.  Besides im really proud of x, y and z about myself- although I could work on a and b. I want to find someone who would appreciate that”
