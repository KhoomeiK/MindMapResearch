dogs,ff6fkza,t1_ff6c94q,1579626122.0,"Our dog looks like a golden retriever. We did one DNA test, didn't believe the results, so we did another and it came back the same. She's 25% rottweiler, 25% Staffordshire terrier, 12% boxer, and 30%  supermutt basically.  First test we got 5% lab, which is the only thing that makes sense with her. Haha."
RealEstate,fetnm30,t1_fep42xc,1579377268.0,We're buying our first house in central Florida and most of the homes seem to have fireplaces and I'm just like ?? It's something we would never use and it's just gonna take space and make decorating annoying for me!
Veterinary,fen6wuk,t3_epuf8n,1579278301.0,You know they giggled to themself the entire time they wrote this and put it in. I would! Haha
askscience,fem6cpn,t1_fem4rj5,1579241328.0,"Do you have studies that show starvation mode exists? As far as I'm aware, it's a myth. I've done cico and lost weight without exercising. You just don't want to restrict yourself too much."
aww,fe6cxip,t1_fe6c8j2,1578887277.0,"Parvo can stick around for years I think. Shit ton of ways for a dog to get it too. It can spread from feces/vomit, so walkin a puppy in an area where lots of dogs use the bathroom could be not good."
aww,fe656mr,t1_fe64cfp,1578882029.0,"Not stupid! I wondered the same thing! You don't or you find an area that no or not a lot of dogs roam. Puppies don't need long walks for exercise though. It's bad for their joints as they're growing. You usually ""walk"" a puppy 5 min for each month. So 2 months old is only 10 min walk twice a day. We just played a lot with our pup inside or in our back yard and it was plenty for her. And lots of mental stimulation! It's better than physical exercise!

Socializing is about letting a dog see different things, not necessarily interacting with stuff.

However, if you're in a low risk area for parvo, your vet might say it's okay. Our vet told us they have had cases of parvo around, so we were cautious. Just a risk vs reward. One dude on another subreddit said he'd rather his dog die from parvo than be unsocialized so yeah..."
aww,fe5pboa,t1_fe5of5w,1578872484.0,"That's great! :) I worked as a vet tech at a rescue for awhile so I was super paranoid for awhile! Haha.

I hope you guys have tons of fun together! :D"
aww,fe5m8ro,t1_fe5euwb,1578871263.0,"Parvo is a risk, but please weight the risk with socialization too. It's really important for a pup. You can take her outside, just don't let her touch the ground or meet unfamiliar dogs. Some people buy little backpacks for them! Haha. Husband and I just carried our girl everywhere. Wish we would have taken her to more places, but she got really car sick, so had to limit it."
todayilearned,fcw4xsl,t1_fcw40zp,1578017244.0,Omg. I love that so much! He's so freaking surprised!
reactivedogs,fc3v2tc,t1_fc3su78,1577399382.0,This is what I do with our pup. We have a 'nose' command where I'll point to the object and she'll come up and sniff it and then get praise and a treat for being brave.

todayilearned,fc1wpf8,t1_fc1t8ph,1577332049.0,We just finished it. It's a Christmas tradition for us!
Dogtraining,fbvd3vl,t1_fbu5q1b,1577129081.0,You should check out /r/puppy101! Lots of good information there. I also want to mention that it's possible for your dog to get overtired and become a little devil. Enforced naps are a savior!
