Start the year by exercising twice a week, once you're comfortable with that, try three times. Instead of changing your whole diet, slowly change what you already eat to healthier alternatives. Like yogurt? Change it to healthier yogurt with less sugar and more protein. Want something sweet? Try eating a piece of fruit instead of that candy bar, and if you really want the candy bar, eat it, eat another one if that wasn't enough, as long as that doesn't happen everyday.
