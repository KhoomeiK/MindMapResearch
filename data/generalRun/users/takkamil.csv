AstralProjection,fdnw6kn,t3_em0ffi,1578594081.0,"great man. congrats! Last time I had an OBE was 3 years ago, I separated, and few around the neighbourhood. I took a Monroe Institute excursion workshop in Italy a few months ago and almost did it once more (because I am trying to re learn) but only OOB'd partly. Thanks for the inspiration!"

I will write 1000 more articles. and there will only be criticism. you do and so you learn. and yes. agree with still keeping you family in the radar. but just not seeking dependence from them. because to mom you will always be a baby. ;p

getdisciplined,fcnwtba,t1_fcgii5i,1577820019.0,ya some people don't know how to do laundry or cook
getdisciplined,fcnwq86,t1_fcfxbqx,1577819972.0,ya makes sense. I was given things. but also had to work hard for things. my mom was the only one who take care of me. moved us to the USA. no father. I worked my ass off when I was young. but always depended on my mom to fix my problems. give me emotion support and help me with integrating into the norm (school. doctors and all that shit)
getdisciplined,fcnweo1,t1_fcftqgo,1577819789.0,"yeah I gotcha. I believe you should have one foot in the ""physical world"" and one foot in the ""spirit world"". but definitely realise that this is just a short game we're all playing. so don't take it too seriously. just make it 'your' game."

Anyways. this article was written for people who are still dependent on their parents. into their early/ late twenties. as a wake up call. because I realised that this was the case for me somewhat. so I wanted to give people some advice from my experience as well as write a bit about how I see financial and emotional dependance. :)"
LifeAdvice,fc5035g,t1_fc3z0t4,1577436207.0,you got this! small steps :)
LifeAdvice,fc50138,t1_fc4y07r,1577436124.0,"yeah exactly man. I'm with you on this. kids need to learn about work ethic when they're young, otherwise they will believe that everything is owed to them. I was like this as well, I wasn't spoiled but I was babied by my mother. she was always doing everything for me and never let me be own my own so i just ""broke out"" I left home, went to live with a friend and started to do shiiit on my own, and that really changed my reality drastically. Good on you brother! thanks for reading!"
