NintendoSwitch,fentg5c,t1_fenm7cw,1579290571.0,"i don't think i'd ordinarily play Luigi's Mansion as it definitely is a more casual experience. My wife, however, is a very casual gamer so it is perfect to play together co-op. Having said that she still struggles with the controls, mainly the aiming."

NintendoSwitch,feau0xl,t3_eoau5q,1578952183.0,"Starlink: Battle for Atlas. The dubbed ""boss fight"" of deals, as it is always facing off for the newest and lowest deal price. I finally pulled the trigger when bestbuy had it for $5.99.  


I hate pay to play games. I hate paywall to content games. I hate gimmicky toy games... but for $6, i figured why not give the game a shot, as i've also wasted a dollar here or a dollar there on very sub-par games on sale.  


All i can say is that i am glad i picked it up! Is it deep? no, not especially. Is it novel? not at all... Is it like a hybrid version of No Man's Sky mixed with Starfox? mehhhh, that is a stretch. But is it any fun? Yeah, yeah it is! Graphics are nice. Gameplay, while repetitive, is still fun. The game is totally playable without any additional purchases, and the few weapons you do get can be upgraded. I'll never use the toys, and i can't justify buying the additional DLC, but for what i spent and what i got, i am definitely stoked and enjoying it!"

It was them saying ""oh no,"" ""oh noooo"" ""OHHH YEAH"" like the kool-aide man. Joke was on them as I slept with that thing until i got married. Best part was if anyone rolled over in my bed they were always confused as the bear started yelling its recording."

I finally decided to spend a little gift money on getting it again on Switch! Only bummer is i also got Dragon's Dogma as a gift, and even though i already started it... i know that it will have a long banishment to the back-burner thanks to Witcher 3."

Thanks to the switch I can finally play games like this since most of my gaming is on the go. I got it for Christmas and just started, but it is about what I expected! A solid PS3 era RPG."

NintendoSwitchDeals,fcnzoni,t3_ei6x6a,1577821469.0,"I really like this game. I typically don't like games of this genre (i.e. Don't Starve), but something about the art, music and atmosphere got to me. As /u/shadowen1942 said, once you ""figure it out"", the game becomes pretty easy. The process of figuring it out and getting farther each time is fun. It is also worth nothing that it is perma-death, however, there are checkpoints if you get far enough. There is a catch though.... if you already screwed yourself over pretty well, then a checkpoint isn't going to help at all, as you'll still be in dire shape.

This is one of those few game that i had on PS4 and PC, but i bought it anyways for the switch just because it is so fun to just pick it up a do a run every once in a while. I feel like most people will easily get $5 of entertainment out of it!"

My wife has grown up with dogs her whole life, and even then we spent months doing research and going through all the latest and greatest training research and books (shout out to r/dogtraining for having a comprehensive list of up to date resources). The timing just worked out that the pup we wanted hit the 8-week mark a few days before Christmas!

Getting a pupper should never be a flippant or spontaneous decision unless you are well seasoned and prepared =)
