It's very frustrating and it makes me feel like it's my fault, but at the same time I wonder if I am wrong. I'm still not sure if it's just me, or if since my coworkers agree I'm not insane and it's them... 
But I still feel like I'm just being a snowflake or something."

offmychest,fdoyhhw,t3_emaut1,1578615773.0,"One of my friends from work and I were starting to actually hang out more. We were planning to hang out after Christmas, but Christmas Eve was hard. My family is very toxic, and at the time my boyfriend was abusive, so it was hard.

I used to leave work and tell everyone, ""don't die"", but I had been a bit short with her, because her family was wonderful and I was jealous. We were alone in the backroom, and I did apologize, and told her how good she was to deal with me and everyone else being assholes, but I hoped her holiday would be wonderful and better than mine. 

I smiled, and for the first time in months left without saying, ""don't die.""

She was found the next morning dead in bed. The report sound vaguely like suicide, but her doctor had, in my opinion, miss diagnosed pneumonia, and he was friends with the coroner, so was marked as an unknown reason for a 26 year old to die in her sleep.

 I still think about it often. It's been almost 10 years. I wish I could have done something, or texted her later to check in on her since I know she got home closer to midnight, but I didn't.

I'm still friends with some other ex co-workers, and we often hang out, but we don't really talk about Erin very much, and if we do, it's still like she is just a friend you have not seen in ages."

offmychest,fcn2e1c,t1_fcn18e0,1577801337.0,"That is exactly why I get so annoyed. I feel like a Karen every time I go back to get a diet soda so I can actually have something, or if I was using door dash, then I'll call them and tell them to be careful. I don't even want free stuff, just the knowledge that I won't have to use 2-3x my medication. A can of coke has more sugar than a double quarter pounder meal And a medium size fries from McDonald's. Or close to equal sugar. A medium soda is like 1 1/2 to 2 cans of coke of sugar.

I just normally get the large, which is like 2-3 cans of coke or more depending since cup sizes are different for every store brand, and sometimes different depending on location of the same brand."
offmychest,fcn12by,t1_fcmrna4,1577800179.0,"It doesn't matter your age or position in life. Depression is horrible.

Don't try to be happy, just try to be whole. You don't need to be happy. Just be able to care for yourself and accept yourself. 

No one is truly happy, but they accept and care for themselves, and that is the difference."

offmychest,fcn0m13,t1_fcmqdbb,1577799769.0,"You are not alone. I basically only talk to my family via Facebook and a yearly visit because they are the same. It's toxic to stay in the situation, and she doesn't and probably won't be to see it. 

Honestly, try to get away from the situation. It sounds terrible, but do like a business trip for a weekend in a hotel just to think by yourself and help stay away from that. Maybe start therapy. She might think you are having an affair, but honestly, if you are planning on killing yourself after your kid is an adult, or even having that thought, then you need this more than them.

I have been through 5 parent suicides in the last 10 years. The survivors are more affected by it than you think. Most of the kids were under 10 at the time, and I know that as teens it's messed with them as they realized the living parent lied about what happened to daddy, but the teens and adult kids that go through it are worse upfront from in. They tend to develop depression and survivors guilt because of it almost immediately, instead of years later. The kids always blame themselves because the surviving parents can't accept that their partner died and they didn't notice. 

The other parents always get to a point where they blame the children even if they don't mean to.
So, even if you wait, it will still mess with them. 

Try and get help. Call a suicide hotline, if you have the money get one of the apps for therapy. That way you know you aren't alone. It's hard, and it gets harder, but you are strong enough to have a plan to wait, so just keep waiting. 

Your life matters more than you realize."
offmychest,fcmzq7b,t1_fcmo9un,1577798931.0,"I read something yesterday about trying to do at least 1%.
You don't have to do it perfect, just strive to do something. 
Can't brush your teeth for the full 2 minutes, then do 10-30 seconds. 
Can't take a shower today, then wash your face.
You feel like shit and like everything is your fault? Then smile, because you are not alone. 

It doesn't have to be perfect, it doesn't even have to be done well, just do something. It will help. I have been doing this for years, and only just saw it in writing yesterday.

Someone cares. Hell, I don't know anything about you, but I care just from reading your post. 

You matter, even if you don't realize it yet."
offmychest,fc10t9f,t3_efhnjc,1577305010.0,"Winter is hard, holidays are hard. I know how that feels. 

Honestly, I had to find others to make me feel better about myself. It doesn't always work, but try to do something that will help others, and if you can do it in a way that people will notice so you have a reason to stay. 

I hope that you can find a will to stay, because someone will miss you. Even if you don't believe it."
