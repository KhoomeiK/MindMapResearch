SmashRage,ff8r3zg,t1_ff3mfro,1579692670.0,"Is he really though? How many tournaments are we actually seeing Hero get results in, and are taking spots away from other players? Seriously, show me some examples because I'm so sick of this ""Hero ruins competitive smash"" hyperbole. On that same note, I'd love to actually play a Hero who can BEAT me because I think I've won 95% of my games against him."

SmashRage,feuaeh5,t3_eqj9ul,1579384675.0,"Sakurai literally said himself, with the DLC characters they're aiming to introduce characters with unique movesets that change the game a bit. So sorry to say that while Byleth is no Hero, we can already see some cheesy moves with him."
SmashBrosUltimate,femvekx,t1_fempqog,1579270633.0,Same. I groaned when I realized it was FE but the moveset looks interesting. Not to MENTION WE GET 6 MORE CHARACTERS. Anyone who feels robbed needs to grow up
SmashRage,femj4xj,t3_epp4o5,1579258230.0,Honestly? Get over it! FE is extremely popular in Japan. We got 1 FE DLC out of 5 so far. And We have six more slots to go. So I hope Nintendo hears these reactions and stops with the FE stuff just so I dont have to hear people bitching.
SmashRage,femif31,t1_fekw3lr,1579257181.0,He looks pretty unique to me lmao
SmashRage,fejxwva,t3_epjrbf,1579188364.0,"We still have 6 more slots to fill! While I'm upset they used this last slot for a FE fighter he looks pretty cool, and I'm not even an FE fan. They were bound to do another one since Three Houses was a pretty big hit."

CloneHero,fdq110m,t3_emmjqz,1578649536.0,"Moonscraper, to me, was incredibly easy to get started with. Theres like a 5 part tutorial on youtube with all the basics, very short videos. I watched them at work and charted a song that day"
CloneHero,fdpzm2i,t3_emo8ia,1578647535.0,"Not 100% sure about the dual shock thing, but some guitars if the strum bar is flicked too hard, when it resets its self back to the neutral position it can strum the other way. Sometimes this is a good thing bc you can strum extremely fast passages, but sometimes if I strum hard and my hand slips I get a double strum"
