sports,fewmnqn,t1_fewjrm4,1579414862.0,I hope fighters start experimenting with unique moves more often now! The cowboy was completely shocked by it because these fighters all use the same/similar fighting styles now.
sports,fewmiz6,t3_eqseo2,1579414718.0,These top rank UFC fighters seem to all be following the same fight style training regimes. Proof is when they were hit with a move they haven't seen before and it completely shut him down. I hope this becomes the norm to find unique but effective fight moves to use in fights because itll make fights so much more fun to watch. GG Connor!!

Furthermore, USA has drama with a lot of Arab countries so it also makes sense to partner up with the only country in the middle east also against them."

They are truly as white/blue as Xenon without the glare of a xenon bulb installed in a non-xenon projector.
