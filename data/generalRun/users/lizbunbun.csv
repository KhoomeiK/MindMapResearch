But the results of this wine are nice enough I'm certainly going to be content with just brewing it into wine if we are feeling lazy.

We pressed ours but another option to juice them is to freeze them first and then they naturally release a lot of juice upon thawing, if you have the freezer capacity. Also fine is simmering them in a large canning pot and then straining."

The main thing was opting for veggie cups/platters when picking out road snacks. I can literally stuff myself with veggies without overdoing it on calories.  Also apples, for something sweet.  Most gas stations have those available, if you can't swing by a grocery store.

If you're feeling like shit at the end of the day, you've cut too many carbs. Eat something to help get your blood sugars back up. 

You are already doing a great job by just making sure you're getting some regular exercise, if only for the fact it will help you feel better and get stronger. Remember muscle weighs more than fat."

reactiongifs,ffjybvh,t1_ffihccl,1580010318.0,"You could come check out r/intermittentfasting and talk about the starting days with people there.  Our premise is generally skipping breakfast and limiting eating to a certain timeframe of the day, like only within an 8 hour window from 10 am until 6 pm.  Then it becomes less about being super-controlled about what you eat, and just growing more mindful about recognizing when you're not actually hungry, and about what works for you in order to stay feeling good (not getting faint and sick). 

Any change to your eating habits has to be a gradual thing too, to see how your body responds. If it's too extreme at once, you'll feel unwell and give up."
