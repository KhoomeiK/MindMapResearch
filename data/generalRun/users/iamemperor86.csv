Georgia,fgmohj9,t1_fgmj73n,1580928787.0,"Rural GA... Where everything is negotiable :)

Gwinnett county was surprisingly lenient actually. Clarke ran us through like cattle, the choices were accept the fine with points and go pay, or request a trial by jury. That was the 1 experience where I wish I hadn't wasted my time and just sent in the money. 

I also have a great record, no criminal record, and this is 4 tickets spread out over ~15 years. I've sat in court and seen repeat offenders get nailed pretty hard. Some people were sentenced to prison at Gwinnett... Cuffs went on the spot, was very dramatic for some."
Georgia,fgmb2q9,t1_fgm84so,1580921226.0,"No, different counties. Basically they drop the ""real"" charge and charge you with a city ordinance, such as too fast for conditions, which is still a fine but not reportable to state records."

How do we know this Earth wasn't supposed to be heaven? What if there's a tree in heaven? Point is, if god fucked up Earth, I'll bet heaven will get fucked up too. Furthermore, if heaven *can* be a perfect place, and *is* a perfect place, why wouldn't an omniscient (all knowing) god just skip right to it, or institute the same rules of heaven on earth from the start?"
