Digital nomads, people who work odd jobs, van dwellers and on and on. Don't fall into the trap of full time work, it is exactly that, a trap to keep you enslaved. Don't be ashamed of 'only' having a part time job either, that's more than many people in the world will ever have. Money is money, and as long as you get enough to have a basic existence that is good enough. Life is what you make it, and i'd rather have my freedom than spend 40+ years slaving away to make someone else rich."
depression,fe75qh9,t3_env9a0,1578910414.0,"This is something most of us feel. Your best option is to try and find something you can at least tolerate. For me I am NEVER going to work for someone else, I work purely online and earn a meagre income, but at least I am comfortable and don't have my life dictated by managers."
depression,fe75kd2,t3_eo28hv,1578910336.0,"Go alone man! Loads of people do, infact many would say it makes for a better experience. You don't have to talk to anyone, just take your seat and enjoy the show."
Snus,fceernf,t1_fc9lctt,1577619762.0,"Nicotine pouches. Really good if you find snus cost prohibitive due to insane taxation. I find they work just as well. You still get the same buzz and burn on the gums. The price seems to have gone up by $2 since I last ordered though, not cool. Will wait for a sale to restock."
Snus,fajoexh,t1_fajnnt1,1576148309.0,"That was my first snus. I loved it. I pushed through the nausea because it made me feel so good. I am only an on and offf smoker and one of the few who doesnt seen able to form a chemical addiction to nicotine. I love it, but i can go without it if i have to."
