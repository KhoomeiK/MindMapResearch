The only difference is we didn't have the help of any other nations like the Americans did, so we ultimately lost.

Us Boers descend from the first settlers from the Dutch East India Company, made up of many different ethnic groups: French, German, Dutch, Scandinavians, etc. By the strict definition of the word, we weren't colonists because there was no single nation that had a semblance of political control. 

But nonetheless, this idea that because we settled there doesn't make us African is so preposterous. The *only* people who are native to South Africa are the Khoisan; 99% of Black people in South Africa (Zulu, Xhosa etc.) descend from the Bantu people, who **invaded** and slaughtered most of the Khoisan people only a few centuries before the first white people arrived in the Cape.

Not even remotely. You're so far off base it's unbelievable. 

You've completely misread every comment I've written, despite the fact I've spent more time than I probably should have spent to clarify and better explain it to you. I'm beginning to think you don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about and are just looking for an argument where there is none. This isn't a point of contention, it's a serious point of discussion among ethicists that's been going on for the last 20-30 years. Take it up with them if you have an issue with it."
todayilearned,fengolx,t1_fend3un,1579284296.0,"> an example in history where an ethical argument prevented someone from doing something rotten on a significant scale

""Significant scale"" belongs almost exclusively to the 20th century. I can't think of many events throughout human history that are in the province of what we've seen this last century (the Holocaust, both World Wars, the Manhattan Project, 9/11, etc.). And as I stated, since the first Industrial Revolution ethicists have been forced to play catch-up and so have had little opportunity to prevent significant ethical missteps because technology progresses too quickly, therefore ethical debate is done so post-mortem. That's my entire point.

Nonetheless, no event on a significant scale throughout our history has ever been initiated and executed by a single individual, that's just impossible and silly reductionism. They all take many people and many instances of ethical decision making, sometimes adding up to be a massive ethical pitfall in an historical scale, but sometimes they result in things being corrected or avoided before they get too bad. It's a total non-sequitur to know precisely *how* bad something could have gone, or exactly what events we've avoided because we don't know what we don't know."
todayilearned,fenbnrh,t1_fen8r0d,1579281230.0,"> but I'd like to know the point in history at which ethical debate was effective in preventing anything bad from happening

It's kind of a non-sequitur to point to a single example, as ethical debate has prevented people from doing bad things for the last few thousand years - or at the very least since we first started to codify moral principles into a set of guidelines to manage our conduct. Every second of every day since about 500 BC, ethics has served us to help anticipate and recognise the moral implications of our behaviour and decisions and correct them so we as a species can continue down the right path.

Essentially, the purpose of ethics is to safeguard and preserve human dignity. Contemporarily, every profession has its own code of ethics that are a bespoke set of moral principles for that field: in medicine, you have the Hippocratic Oath; in law, you have Legal Ethics, etc. Because of these, you can trust that your doctor or lawyer will behave ethically. You know your doctor won't discuss your embarrassing rash to his mates, or swap the saline in your IV drip with LSD because he'd get a kick out of it.

For most of human history, the rate of technological progress has remained relatively linear - for someone born in 10,000 BC, he'd observe the same rate of technological progress in his lifetime as someone born in 1500. The technology would be vastly different, but the *rate* of progress would be the same. This was fine, because ethical debate could keep up. The problem is this thing called the Industrial Revolution came along and everything sped up massively and it became harder for ethicists to guide our way.

The modern factory led to the internal combustion engine, which led to rockets, which led to the atomic bomb. In medicine, we went from applying leeches to people to help heal them, to intentionally infecting blankets with syphilis, or all the diabolical shit that went on in Unit 731 and the Nazi camps.

Now it's algorithms; self-driving cars; facial-recognition software; background monitoring of your conversations for targeted marketing; social credit systems that stop you from using public transport because you criticised the government on your social media."
todayilearned,fen0k4t,t1_femrq0c,1579274259.0,"He wrote it in 1995, already well into the Digital Revolution so he's hardly a soothsayer. The exponential rate of technology and the linear rate of ethical debate is (and already was, at that point) a major point of anxiety among ethicists. It means that as technology advances exponentially, current ethical debate gets increasingly left in the dust, thus meaning it's harder for us to anticipate and correct where we're going.

It's actually really distressing when you realise that all the modern technologies that we use on a day-to-day basis are built and implemented before any real debate about the ethical consequences can be conducted. Some jerkoff in Silicon Valley thinks up an idea and overnight it's prototyped and launched and no one stops to think is it ethical or not. A lot of the time we only realise the repurcussions long after the damage has been done. Fucking algorithms, digital recreation of deceased actors for films, Cambridge Analytica etc.

I was merely asserting that the quality of life for (ethically farmed) livestock is vastly better than animals in the wild. That is undeniable, your cute little Philosophy 101 comment notwithstanding. I never said I had an answer for it; on the contrary, I even acknowledged the vegan position."

Death means either being eaten alive by predators or being too old and sick and tired to find food that you starve to death.

It's why I get so annoyed when vegans have a go at people who eat meat. I respect the ethics of veganism, but at least with farmed animals they don't have to worry about predators; when they're sick they're administered medicine; when they're hungry they're given food; and when it's their time to go they're killed humanely.

Essentially you had the the Khoisan people who were the only native people there, and have existed in that region since the first humans (Cradle of Humankind), then about 1000-1500 years ago the Bantu people migrated down into South Africa from Central Africa and whence the Zulu, Swasi and Xhosa people (among others) come from. 

Then about 400 years ago Europeans who were travelling on the Dutch East India Company's ships thought to hell with this all this travelling, this place is pretty good for growing crops we'll just settle here. So you had primarily Dutch people, but also French, Scandinavian and German people (mainly escaping European religious persecution, e.g. Huguenots, Protestants etc.) settling and farming and gradually becoming what we know as the Boer people.

Then in the 1800s the British realized how unbelievably wealthy South Africa was in terms of diamonds and gold (you used to be able to find seas of diamonds sitting on top of the dirt) and so they came in and did what they do best, they banned Afrikaans and persecuting the Boer people. The Boers rebelled in two massive guerilla campaigns (Boer Wars) and held their own for a while until the British resorted to putting their women and children in concentration camps. The Boers move inland on these massive treks (Grote Trek) to get away from the British who were mainly on the Cape, which caused conflict from the black people as the Boers started taking their land.

Cut to about 100 years later and South Africa creates this abominable thing called apartheid, basically becomes North Korea for about 50 years, then Mandela gets released from Robin Island and the rest is history.
