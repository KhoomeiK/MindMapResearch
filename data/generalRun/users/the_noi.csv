Showerthoughts,ffejh7j,t1_ffdftga,1579850547.0,I think that we’ve wasted our talents and efforts building this kind of thing rather than useful technology shows we aren’t yet advanced at all.  That we can still see other humans with enough derision and fail so hopelessly at reaching each other or not hating that this is something we could do to another.  It gives no pride or awe or respect. Advanced nothing.
TwoXChromosomes,ffcvb1a,t1_ffcnh7l,1579808003.0,"Don’t be sorry. Don’t ever excuse yourself when you do no one any harm. My actual reply in attempt to aid you and offer hope will also be long, so with your permission I’ll DM."
MomForAMinute,ffabuh7,t3_esdb0o,1579731865.0,"Yes and no. 

No: it’s fine to wonder that he’s ok, and it’s not being to needy to ping a follow up message (you can even put it in the passive to suggest it doesn’t need a reply): “I hope you got back safely. Sleep well, can’t wait to see you...”

Yes: but in the interim times it could be better for you to chill. It’s not about being an attached girlfriend, per se, and just being too attached in general.  Trust a little more. You and he have made plans, things are good, trust in the love.  Fire and forget with these messages. Don’t waste your time on waiting for a reply, get on with something (unless it’s like: yo I’m at the shop, want me to buy x?). Be stoic."
AskReddit,ffaa3v0,t3_esdjti,1579730854.0,"DRIVE.   Fuck that movie. The first 30 minutes are promising as a artsy unique film with interesting long camera shots and odd placements, with epic music. 

Then it turns into a completely different film about this emotionally blank “character” who barely says anything and actually does some pretty psychotic shit when you stop ogling Ryan gosling and realise.  He’s not a good guy, not an anti hero, not a villain nor a victim; just a really boring lunatic who takes fucking forever to say anything and doesn’t have any consistency to his motivations."
funny,ffa8s51,t1_ff9t37s,1579730101.0,Is.. is he ok?
MomForAMinute,ffa80lf,t3_es8ae1,1579729674.0,"Honey, I’m sorry. Im sorry I’m not good at this. I’m not good at being who you need me to be. Hell, I’m not even good at being who I need me to be! I don’t think I’ve ever been honest enough with you or myself about that. About how unprepared I am to instil in you the self-love you’ll need to get by. I don’t have enough either sometimes. 

But you don’t have to be me. I implore you not to. I want you to be so much better. You can be, you are already.  I’ve known that since the moment you were born you have always been, and still are, absolutely perfect.   

It’s a tough day for any of us to realise that pillar of stability and knowledge doesn’t always have the answers, it was in my turn.  Sorry that you’re still so young, but I have every faith in you to figure it out. Lean on others as well as me: professionals and friends; but rely on yourself even more. 

A hug I can do, but some of the deeper issues are beyond my scope.  I can be shallow and weak at times, I’m scared myself that I don’t know. I didn’t mean to fail you in that moment. But I bet you can trick me: come at me with open arms and a smile and I’m sure I can’t resist!  Sorry you would even have to go about it this way. But, who knows, maybe that’ll be all that you needed without saying a word.  

When I’m petty, be the bigger person. 


Don’t let anyone else’s behaviours or words ever tell you how you should feel about yourself. That just tells you about themselves, like how I’m admitting now that me not giving you what you needed then was my failing, not yours, and I’m sorry. Only your opinion of you matters, and it can be whatever you want. This doesn’t mean snap out of it, just that if you (and only you) think there are areas you can improve, then improve them. I advise you to take control of that.  ...But the parts you believe about yourself only because someone else put you down, (or did it better so you put yourself down); or there’s some future situation you’re anxious of... those feelings belong to other people and other places. They do not belong to your sense of self or self-worth.  

And I lied. No one has got their shit sorted out at 18! Hahaha absolutely no one!!! I shouldn’t have put that on you, most all of us are still figuring this out as we go along. If I had my shit figured out myself I’d have given you a better answer first time around, wouldn’t I?. Forgive me for being a hypocrite. 

—Love yourself. Be your own centre of stability and worth. Be the love you think you deserve - because you deserve all of it, in its purest form!  
—Find your owns sources of help that are reliable and work for you. A friend whose arms are always open; and a therapist who doesn’t shut you down. You can clearly use the Internet better than me, and there are wiser people out there than me. 
—Finally, but most importantly, have courage. Courage is simply having the understanding that in every situation where you anticipate pain or a negative experience, there is the opportunity also to survive, to work past, to achieve or understand or pull it off, to work it out, to be safer or freer than you are now, to grow!     You can’t tackle the player if you’re standing still or dodging away. Instead of fearing their oncoming charge, you have to meet it with equal velocity to come out alright. Luckily with the problems inside, there’s no risk of concussion :). 

I love you, with all my heart. Love yourself just as much."
