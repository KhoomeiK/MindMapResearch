Yep, sure does happen when you're a contractor and work for yourself... at least, I hope you don't think that you're a shitty boss.

Edit: another, serious question.

Since you've been in business classes, do they let you just skip?  Like you can just not go when you want to and you don't have to tell them where you are or what's happened?  

Also, what do you do if you fill their spot and then the original customer shows up late?  How do you fit them in?  Do you just tell them to leave?  (Then you have a spot later on in your day, which you've lost money for?)"
ADHD,ffwukch,t1_ffwjfjx,1580311334.0,"I get that.  When I got diagnosed in October, I was in the middle of a school semester.  I knew it would impact my work/school productivity and that it did/would impact my social skills (luckily, I've had some pretty great friends through all of this, both at college and at home).  Over Thanksgiving break, I started digging deeper.  I read, ""You Mean I'm Not Lazy, Stupid, or Crazy?!"" (Kelly and Ramundo).  It opened my eyes to how much this disorder truly does affect my life.

It affects how we perceive things, how we do things, why we do what we do.  It truly does affect every single thing, and very little of it is truly our fault (this does not give you a pass card for the consequences of your choices, but it is an explanation).  

Hang in there, friend.  You're not defective."

ADHD,ffvlv62,t3_evduc2,1580267181.0,"I feel this.  <3 You are not alone, and your anger is valid.

My grandma worked in special education.  She was six hours away from a master's.  But she told my mom there was no way I had ADHD because I ""wasn't hyperactive"".  (I was, but since mine showed up differently than my cousin's, I was just acting up).  Instead of seeking help for me, she mentally manipulated me and verbally abused me for YEARS.  I didn't learn I had ADHD until I was 19 and met my long-lost sister, who also has ADHD, and went to college.

Give yourself some room to grieve and/or be angry.  The edge, for me, has passed with time but it still does flare up from time to time.  Be open about it, talk to a therapist or your doctor or someone else you trust.  

Maybe this isn't healthy, but what I've started doing is all of the things my grandmother/parents told me I'd never do.  I'm in college with a 3.5 (with accommodations).  I want to be a school psychologist/counselor/someone who works with children with ADHD, and I'm headed to my PhD or PsyD someday.  I've passed classes everyone told me I'd fail, and I \*am\* a success story.  Now I get to be a peer mentor to other students with learning difficulties.  

I don't do it for them: I do it for me, because I am worthy of success despite my disabilities.

AskAcademia,ff9gacz,t3_esdari,1579712386.0,"I was homeschooled and have my GED, so our experiences might be a little different.  But I started out at community college.

My CC was the biggest in my large metropolitan city, and it had several transfer agreements with area (and even out-of-state) colleges.  I transferred to the large university in my city, and even though there wasn't a transfer agreement specific to my degree, all of my credit was taken.

My university required 24 hours of credit at a certain GPA for transfer.  I had 19.  They took me anyway, on probation, because my GPA was something like 3.5.  

I love my university to pieces, but I can see the benefit of staying at community college for longer if your degree allows it (mine didn't).  There is a bigger, better support system here, I can easily get to know professors, there's an honors program and more scholarships and all of that stuff.  I love everything being \*right here\* (library, gym, barbershop, cafes, plus academic departments).  Even though my commute is about 25 minutes longer than if I was still going to CC, I can come and spend the entire day, doing office work in the library, going to class, eating with friends who live on campus, and finishing my day out with office work.

At community college, they are more willing to let you explore your passions: change majors, take non-credit classes (that don't ""count"" towards anything), etc.  It's much, much cheaper.  For me, it was much closer.  Here, if I fail a class and my GPA dips below a certain point, I go back on probation, I lose my scholarship, I get kicked out of honors.  There, I could struggle and there were, in a sense, few consequences (SAP was one, but that was about it).  There were less expectations,  but here, when I struggle, I have multiple someones to turn to.

Anyway, I hope this makes sense haha.  Both are great for different times in life, I think.  Don't be sold to the idea that you \*have\* to do all four years at one school; different schools can give you different experiences and such.  I think it's impossible to know how you feel about a school by one four-hour visit, or reading their website.  

Best of luck to you!"
