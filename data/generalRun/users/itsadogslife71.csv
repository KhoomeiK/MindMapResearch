I hate the saying “those who wait also serve” but the origin of it was a poem by John Milton who had a disability but was reassuring himself that he was still useful to God. Somehow it got adapted to military wives and to an extent it is true because when a spouse is deployed, the person left has to run the household, take care of the kids, etc. so the spouse can do their job without worrying.  Most of these women are really young and stupid and they will divorce because they can’t handle the waiting steadfastly without cheating."

Work life balance company wide was 0%. So they had meetings with what they could do to “improve it”. Their solution? Hold town hall meetings, throw lunches for the “top” performers and tell everyone to be positive. Then about a week after that, they decided the answer was everyone needed to go home with no work left on their desks. In my department, the work literally never stops coming in. If you go on vacation, you might not get new files but the old files still get things to do. No one has time to do all the work in 8 hours. The expectation is that you “won’t leave until it is done” and it has gotten so bad, my friend, who has kids, was told by her supervisor that our job is best suited for people without kids when my friend has to leave after a full day of working to go get her kids.

She should have had a private conversation with him. And her version has flip flopped. Originally she said a woman can win and he disagreed, then it was he just told her a woman can’t be president and she disagreed. So which is it? And what was the context of the conversation? Because while I believe a woman can win and should win a presidential election, I am not so dumb to think in this climate, it is not going to be extremely difficult for one to do so. So if the truth is somewhere in between them...and is indeed just a misunderstanding of what each heard or said, accusing him of being a sexist on par with Trump, and CNN basically accusing him of being a total dirtbag, would make anyone angry. He was asked why he said it first...so CNN clearly got this straight from Warrens own mouth, then, even after he said that, they dismissed his answer out of hand and asked her what her response was when he said a woman couldn’t win, as if he was not even there.

CNN doesn’t even want her. They want Joe Biden and she helped to divide the progressives."
