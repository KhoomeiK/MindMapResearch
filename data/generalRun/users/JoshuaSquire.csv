depression,fcskhvt,t3_eihb6b,1577918408.0,Feel like the same as you. It's a difficult life.
depression,fcsjucz,t3_eidxlt,1577918008.0,"Yup. Currently on year... 6? 7? of doing nothing, just being depressed. It's really fucking difficult some days to want to continue, I feel like this will be my life forever, it's not just about feeling happy or sad, but I feel like it's just who I am. I'm a lazy piece of shit that will never achieve anything in life, I guess that's my destiny. I get so incredibly lonely sometimes, but then other times I just don't want to talk to anyone, or be around anyone. Another year, same old me."
depression,fcsh2nl,t3_eieavt,1577916437.0,"Lmao legit. Sat at home drinking on my own, so pathetic."
depression,fbby0gx,t3_ec7vml,1576710941.0,"Yup, feel the same way, it's been so long I don't even remember who I was anymore."
