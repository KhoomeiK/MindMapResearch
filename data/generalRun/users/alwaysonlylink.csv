confession,ffmcmef,t1_ffmawet,1580052413.0,"It's always on the bubble, I guess that's how they get us to remain productive. And yes, I think that there is definately an imbalance of money, power, what have you. But there has to be a better way to change things than encouraging what amounts to anarchy in the work place. When they catch the Redditor (and they will) they will have reason to prosecute them to the fullest. Don't let them win at all! Find a better way. :)"
confession,ffm6sgs,t1_ffln9x5,1580049491.0,"This is horrible advice and I'm sure the poster will not heed it. First off, most companies hire 3rd party companies as loss prevention officers. Its nothing off the companies back and from what I know those companies are horrible to work for. The hours are terrible and the pay is worse. 
Secondly, most stores have budgets and a certain percentage is set aside for theft (or shrink). Where I work there are certain incentives set aside for management AND employees. If we make budget and jump through all the hoops they have set up then we are entitled to a modest bonus. Therefore, the poster would be stealing right out of my pocket and the corporation at large is never hurt as they have made their money."
