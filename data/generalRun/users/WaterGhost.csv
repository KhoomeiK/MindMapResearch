loseit,fdxnkeg,t3_enbmiv,1578770933.0,Try building muscle by lifting weights.  Body recomposition.  It’ll help by getting rid of the fat dragging the folds of skin down.
fatlogic,fdtt32f,t1_fdtm15e,1578721770.0,"It could be a matter of difference in body composition.  I started lifting some light weights last September, and although my weight on the scale hasn’t changed much, I’ve lost a lot of flab and am down a size.  Your sister might have a bit more muscle than you.  Congrats on the weight loss, though!"

About college - I heard a studying tip recently that I’m eager to try out myself.  It is to keep two notebooks for each course: one notebook for the notes you take in class, and another notebook full of questions you write based on the class notes.  Update the “question” notebook after each class, review it frequently, and make sure you can answer all the questions.  Good luck!"
