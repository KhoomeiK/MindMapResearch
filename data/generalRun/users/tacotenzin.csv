AskMen,ffmmg4n,t3_eu2ixr,1580056671.0,"Only when there is no other option, i.e. true self defense or the defense of innocent persons. 

Most people are not trained to fight safely or effectively. While the human body can survive some incredible things, it can also take surprisingly little to kill us. One lucky blow and you could die. You could also accidentally kill someone trying to simply disable them; even when killing someone else is justified (self defense), for most people it will be a big emotional struggle coming to terms with haven taken someone’s life. 

My chain of options in a scenario that could be a fight: 

1. De-escalation. Many fights are preventable by using basic techniques. I highly recommend watching videos on YouTube or, if able, taking a training course. 

2. Flee. Don’t let your pride or fear of being called a coward force you to engage. Is your pride really worth potentially taking a life or losing your own? 

3. Defend. If you have no other option, do what you have to do to survive or defend an innocent life. I personally think everyone should take a basic self defense course."

HolUp,fflzqh2,t1_ffjyh6k,1580046313.0,">> Culture is ideas, traditions and values and shouldn’t be tied to words. 

Words *are* culture and they’re a primary way we identify and *share* cultures. 

The problem with nigga/er is the extremely strong racist history. For centuries “nigger” was used as a term by white persons to degrade Black people. It was used to identify them as “less than people” and to “put them in their place.” And while slavery ended, the racism endured and that term continued to be used derogatorily. Over time people began to realize the real harm.

The black community began to reclaim the word to help mitigate the pain it causes and adaptares it to “nigga” to differentiate. They can use it more freely because there’s not such an entrenched history of racism between black people themselves. It’s similar to how the gay community took back the words “fag” and “faggot.” Even then, its use is controversial within the black community for many different reasons. 

Words have meaning and people need to remember that. Freedom of speech doesn’t mean there are no consequences to what you say. Like you touched on, its not a free pass to be an asshole. Context is also important. I’ll tell my friends “fuck you” in jest because we know that I don’t mean anything behind it. If I went to a stranger and said “fuck you,” even if I didn’t mean it seriously, they have a right to be upset."

My experience wasn’t as severe as yours, but I can relate to a degree. I was in another country known for sex tourism. I had no interest in it, but being a foreign white male, the prostitutes all assumed that I was. I also didn’t speak their language at all. Well, I made eye contact with a prostitute in the red light distract and she took that as a signal I was interested. I told her no and tried to walk away - she kept following me. After many no’s, she still didn’t accept it and grabbed my dick through my pants. I freaked out and pushed her away (very roughly- she fell to the ground). No one had tried to help or say anything despite me being very clear with my body language and “no.” I was terrified that people would think I assaulted her unprovoked so I ran. I was in a foreign country, alone, where I didn’t speak the language and didn’t know the laws or my rights. 

When I texted my girlfriend back home, she basically blew it off. I tried talking to her about it on several occasions but she was convinced it wasn’t that big of a deal. I’m not proud of it, but I read her texts to her best friend one night while she was in the shower. She had been particularly cold that day after I tried again to talk about it and buried herself in her phone so I wanted to know what was taking her attention.

She had said something along the lines of “I just don’t understand what the big deal is. He’s taking the prostitute thing so hard but it’s just not that big of  a deal. Women have to deal with worse everyday. He needs to get over it.” 

The fact that women have to deal with a lot of horrible shit doesn’t negate men’s suffering. If anything, I empathize more with women now In regard to sexual assault"

The Wuhan outbreak is caused by a new strain of corona virus. We haven’t pinpointed the source yet. The corona virus your dog is vaccinated against is not the same as the virus from wuhan. That also doesn’t mean your dog is at risk either: it is very rare for disease to spread between species, but when it does it can be catastrophic because the newly infected species has no resistance to it at first (smallpox, bubonic plague, etc). 
 
You’re probably safe. There are only a few hundred confirmed cases so far, most of them in China. World governments already have their epidemiology departments working hard to prevent further spread. Just avoid close contact with anyone coughing or sneezing and maintain good hygiene practices (especially washing your hands and avoid sharing eating utensils).

Trump has bragged about sexual assault, takes pride in overt racism, and has even advocated killing the families of terrorists— which is a war crime. He’s even said he respects the way Putin is running his country. 

There’s also the time where he separated parents and children when detained for illegal immigration. And he separated them with a system that was so poorly organized, when one woman was finally supposed to give her baby back, the gave her *the wrong fucking baby.* 


There are so many fucked up things he’s said that it’s impossible to keep track"
PublicFreakout,fefnqcg,t1_fefc3mt,1579060348.0,"I am. But even though the after prison is made very difficult by the system and people keep punishing you, that doesn’t mean we should turn a blind eye when someone commits a crime in goal of getting revenge."
AskMen,feejgqk,t3_eolsp9,1579034991.0,"Stopped worrying about how to impress girls/what they like. Instead, I focused on taking care of myself and becoming the best version of me that I can be. 

Also, working to remember that rejection from a girl is not a reflection on your value as a person. There are 10,000,000 reasons you might be rejected and the majority of them have nothing to do with you. There are 3.8 BILLION women in the world — don’t let the actions of just one affect how you feel about yourself."

PublicFreakout,feehs0a,t1_feee0y1,1579034013.0,"Look, the guy committed a crime when he assaulted the convict. The convict was bound and did nothing in that moment to provoke “self-defense.” The man straight up committed assault He committed it in a court room in front of the police, no less. Given the circumstances I might personally give him a lighter sentence for the assault, but no one should get a free pass to assault someone who is physically restrained and is receiving their legal punishment. 

I’m not saying that the convict doesn’t deserve punched and worse. Killing an infant is a heinous crime. However, the system was already working: he was sentenced to prison and was being taken away. This man assaulting the convict wasn’t delivering justice. He wasn’t teaching the convict a lesson. He was trying to get vengeance outside of the legal system and did so by committing a crime. 

Society has rules and a big one is that people don’t get to deliver their own punishment outside of the criminal justice system."

There are also just things we think about that are completely random and totally pointless and not worth putting into words. Things like, “dogs look so derp when they eat people food,” completely pointless but it’s simpler to say “nothing” than to try to explain why I was having that meaningless thought at that particular moment"
