With your logic, which literally nobody but you recognizes, there’s no such thing as renewable energy. That completely takes away from the denotative meanong and the intended meaning. It’s just a semantics fallacy."

climateskeptics,fftnerm,t1_ffsiky2,1580224932.0,"Something is renewable if it’s replenished on a human timescale, which solar (and by extension wind) absolutely is. Plants are powered by the sun as well.

The sun is powered by nuclear fusion, not fission. There are currently no running fusion plants, nor has anyone even gotten an energy neutral input:output ratio. It’s a prospective technology but we’re not there yet. Even then, fission still is a great power source. It’s the safest and cleanest, it’s reliable, and even in the future we have essentially renewable uranium sources, as well as fast reactors to look forward to."
