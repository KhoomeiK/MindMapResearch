DunderMifflin,fh08wni,t1_fh089jq,1581201451.0,I guess I just don't feel like he would have stolen the show because he clearly was a less selfish version of himself at the wedding. I think he would have been fine at the after party just kicking back. The panel yeah I could agree with that
DunderMifflin,fh04uv1,t1_fh043j0,1581200441.0,My point was that it was a very unpopular ending. I didn't see it I just know it was a great series with a controversial ending.
pics,fh04ezd,t1_fh01e4w,1581200376.0,"To deny that trump is dishonest and disrespectful of the Democratic process and the position of power he holds is to deny reality and to blame the opposing party enforcing the Constitution is proving your ignorance. Your response is a perfect example of the major problem with hyper partisanship that his cabinet had encourage and fostered. Anytime anyone is critical of trump, whether his actions are nuanced or blatantly obvious it is met with absolute denial (regardless of the evidence or facts), then instead of refuting the claim with an appropriate response it is always deflected by pointing the finger back with unfounded proof. The refusal to admit he has no moral compass with the way he conducts his presidency just because of your political party preference is aggregious and the reason America is struggling more than ever. America has never been more divided and it's because of dumb fucks that refuse to look at things objectively and hold people accountable for said actions."

DunderMifflin,fgzy32e,t1_fgzwjek,1581198730.0,I feel like it was absolutely IN character for Michael to want to be surrounded with those people. Also did anyone notice how Holly wasn't at the wedding even though they stated he was with her with kids.
DunderMifflin,fgzvwvj,t1_fgzvfhx,1581198232.0,"Especially since it will absolutely make the money back. Its crazy how many shows have amazing series and fumble the finale (not that this was a complete screw by any stretch) sopranos, how's I met your mother, GOT to name a few."
mildlyinteresting,fgzvb4u,t3_f0vbhq,1581198034.0,People are either going to love it or hate it. Good luck
DunderMifflin,fgzuwnn,t1_fgztyp8,1581197891.0,Yeah I was genuinely upset about it. Obviously his character is someone that would have done anything to be there with them. They didn't try to even address why he wasn't there. Either way it was a major oversight of production or most likely Steve chose not to do it over differences with production (most likely money). For such a great finale they really botched that part and it bothers me Everytime I watch it.
DunderMifflin,fgzqlum,t1_fgy52xb,1581196627.0,You mean the episode where Michael came back to the show but couldn't even show up to the final  gathering at the office after the wedding.

MapPorn,ff8eset,t1_ff8c4b7,1579675402.0,if theologist cant disprove Christianity then some retard on Reddit obviously doesn't have the knowledge to make the claim of it being a crazy religion. where as the additions made by Mormonism is essentially proven to be bullshit. Theres a big difference between a religion practiced world wide for thousands of years VS one that was made by a dude from Vermont that is centralized in one time zone.

MilwaukeeTool,ff1vdzu,t1_ff1umu7,1579487031.0,"What I've learned about Chinese reproduction and counterfeit stuff is if something can't be made cheaper it will probably be comparable quality but just undercut US products because of labor costs. But if there is a way for them to replace the expensive parts with less expensive parts they will even at the risk of it breaking easier and obviously quality control for complex things won't be there. So that's ultimately what you're paying for. If it needs to be precision, or you want it to be reliable then I would buy the American made. But if it's a ruler or some drill bits, no need for the name brand IMO."
