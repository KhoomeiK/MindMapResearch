AskWomenOver30,fct36ks,t3_eip17a,1577931683.0,"I agree with all of you! Especially engaging in more self control and not look at his social media because we really can see what we think we see and not what really is going on. Also, it really is not part of your purview anymore. However moving on is active and part of it could be that you are fantasizing about scenarios that don't exist. Once we have a thought it goes to an emotion and then a belief and you don't want to believe a reality that is not there.

Being in your 30's is awesome! you are right we do have a tremendous amount of independence and that should be throroughly enjoyed because once you get married that would be the next 40 to 50 years of your life. You are really really young but enjoying yourself and being grateful for what you have instead of constantly feeling like you are searching or dissatisfied will bring much more joy with or without a partner. It also becomes more attractive! 

Girlfriends are very vital! I would recommend going to a book club or a meet up for girls, I ended up meeting some of my friend by going to a girls group. If you were in California I would invite you :)"
