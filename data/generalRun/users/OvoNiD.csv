Nissan,ffbajip,t1_ffb9sf3,1579757510.0,"Well, I've built multiple 240-280z, Z31, z32, z33, and z34s, and in my experience the L28 engine is solid, the VG30e and et are solid. The VG30DE family has it's issues, mostly the DETTs because turbo, but anything after that is riddled with problems.

Maybe in your experience you've just had a bad run, but I'm being completely serious here, I have a '86 300ZX sitting in my driveway right now that has never had so much as a tune up, and was daily driven for over 30 years and the only issues I'm having with it right now are some mild electrical issues.

Now, if you make a habit of fixing up Zs that have been ragged out and raced to death then yeah you're going to have issues with any engine, but in the case of the VG line they are reliable.

So no it's not fact. It's just like your opinion man.

The issues with the VQ37 is that even slight gains if not done precisely correct will cause damage. Even installing a single turbo and tune with low boost can cause engine failure. The engine were engineered to be put in and not messed with.

That's why it's common to see people doing engine swaps. Every one of the guys I used to run with who were serious about their scores and times dropped in LS motors. Even the guys I know who just wanted to have fun were swapping in other engines.

Don't be so upset about it. That's just the way it is."

Nissan,ffaotpr,t1_ffao77s,1579740994.0,"Yep. I totally agree. The VG engines were solid. I've got a Z31 sitting in the driveway with the original engine, and it's still running strong.

Nissan,ffakwyc,t1_ffajxxw,1579738322.0,"I'll admit I'm not going to be one of the first to buy one, but I will entertain the idea of purchasing one if it's easy to increase performance.

The 370z was a pita. Almost everyone I know with Z34s ended up doing engine swaps.

If I'm not mistaken from what I've heard from other articles is that the base tier package is going to be low 40k.

But I've also read that the top-tier nismo model will be pushing over 500hp with a big boost in torque, while still offering a six speed transmission.

So, as long as it's not ugly and not a pita to work on I'll probably buy one eventually."
Nissan,ffaiq3i,t3_esj43p,1579736698.0,"About to read the article, but I do like the look(artist rendition). Definitely see some original Fairlady in it.

EDIT: Finished reading the article. Pretty much what everyone knew.

Was really hoping they would give it more horsepower. 400 hp is a negligible increase from the 370z. Especially when it's competition sees 500+ horsepower stock.

I just hope it's not ugly."
funny,ffahvdf,t3_esdxg6,1579736104.0,"For all the posts from people complaining about selling their cars on Craigslist...

Who the hell agrees to pay asking price on a car that hasn't been seen?

The closest I've ever come to agreeing to asking price on a car before seeing it is by telling the seller that if it's in the condition you say it's in. I'll give you what you're asking.

And even then I'm going to offer less if you think your $1500 lunker is worth mint.

But if I drive half an hour tonan hour to get there, and I can tell the seller thinks the car is in better shape than it is, or is trying to pull one over on me I'll offer less, or just leave.

Yeah, because I'm totally going to give someone thousands of dollars for a car posted with clever photos to hide damage and deterioration. If anything the seller just wasted my time driving out to the sticks to try and rob me."
Borderlands,ff8atyw,t1_ff7h3fv,1579671234.0,"I'll agree with you on this. Tina was likeable in BL2, but I guess I just expected her to grow up some in the time span leading up to BL3.

Like, I guess she did somewhat, but as a teenager almost adult and with the harshness of the world they live in there's no way she should have gotten away with her antics that long.

I guess some of the blame lays with Brick and Mordy just letting her have her way all the time. Mordy tries, but Brick being immature himself is a total enabler.

I was hoping to see her as a toughened badass shooting rockets everywhere and blowing everingthing up with homemade bombs. Instead we got a pizza delivery, and some lame relationship drama."

Borderlands,ff6o29n,t3_erv0th,1579631305.0,"I just think after three games of him screwing things up I'm just tired of him.

I'm pretty much tired of all the characters except Brick Mordy, Tina, Tannis, and Krieg. The only new character I liked was Typhon.

In BL1 he was kind of annoying, but amusing.

In Borderlands 2 I thought he was annoying and sad, so I felt for him.

In BL3 from the get go he was just annoying, and not funny. I wasn't happy to see him, he was holding me back. He doesn't care about anyone anymore, he takes credit for everything. The ship had just taken off and he immediately breaks it almost killing everyone. All he cares about is having the player find a ""gf"" robot to be around so he can torment the thing. Claptrap doesn't deserve anything to be stuck around him. He's become a terrible thing.

He definitely shows strong dark triad traits of narcissism, machiavellianism, and psychopathy.

I've never wanted to rip him apart and put a spike through his processor as badly as I wanted to in 3."

AskReddit,fewmmpc,t1_fewkqcg,1579414830.0,"Look man, that's cool and all, but I've been medically checked out throughout my whole life and everything has checked out as perfectly healthy except for one flat foot. I had one psychiatrist want to put me on medication for depression, and I told her to get bent because I'm not depressed.

I'll check out the auras and seizures and whatever, because it sounds interesting, but it's perfectly reasonable not to take advice from people on the internet who I haven't sat down with and had in depth conversations about my physical and mental wellbeing.

Look, I know your trying to be helpful, but just chill man. It's not that big of a deal. The topic was about weird matrix type glitches or whatever, so I stated what I did. Nowhere did I ask for unsolicited help. I've seen professionals, they did tests, I've gone through EEGs, I've had to do everything from record my dreams to record my diet.

I didn't have to tell you this, but I was young when I went through all that so I don't remember all the terms that were thrown out to my parents.

They ended up diagnosing me with ADHD and prescribed me Adderall. Sometime around that period I stopped having dreams at all until I stopped taking the medication. Later on in life when I was an independent adult I was going through my yearly health checkups and asked about if I should still be taking Adderall, after some questioning it turns out that I probably never actually needed it.

When I separated from the military the pyschiatrist I spoke with during my medical outprocessing wanted to put me on anti-depressants. I refused.

A year later I decided to see a psychiatrist on my own to ask about depression, anxiety, BPD, etc. They asked me a series of questions and the psychiatrist said I don't show any significant traits of having any psychiatric problems.

So dude. I've seen professionals. It's not that big of a deal. I saw this as a fun topic to post about something weird that I experienced during childhood and you come replying as if I was trying to say I was some kind of prophet.

I just had weird coincidences, and somehow or another I knew what people were going to say, I knew that something was going to fall off a shelf and onto someone. It's not exactly end of the world kind of stuff.

I'm pretty sure my parents, series of girlfriends, a wife, many friends, and medical doctors would have noticed that something was off about me and told me.

And I'm pretty sure that if I was having seizures I'd probably be dead by now.

So TL;DR I'm going to check out auras and seizures. It does sound kind of familiar now that I think about it, but man it's not the end of the world."
AskReddit,fewjrri,t1_fewiy9b,1579412074.0,"Well, I don't see any reason to do so. I have plenty of hobbies where a seizure of any sort would have a great chance of causing death. I did time in the military, and that would have been something they caught. No offense, even though you may be trying to be helpful, as far as I know you're just a stranger on Reddit. You're not really in a position to be dictating what I or any professional should do."
AskReddit,fewjd3f,t3_eqies2,1579411787.0,"Oh! I just remembered one! I was working my first job as a teenager at a grocery store as the cashier. At some point this guy comes through who was like twenty-something. I'm looking at him, because I remember him from somewhere, but can't place it. He stops and looks at me and says ""[My name], don't you play bass?"" and I responded no, but that I played guitar. And he stared at me for a moment longer and just walked out after paying.

It was weird, because I recognized him, and he definitely was asking me like he knew me or a me that was a little different.

Apparently from other people's accounts I have (had?) a bunch of dopplegangers. Because people would tell me they saw me or talked to me, and I would tell them that had to be someone else. They would insist that it was me."
AskReddit,fewhubb,t1_fevwuhc,1579410844.0,"It doesn't happen often anymore, but when it does I get the same nauseated feeling. Now though it's more of a sneak surprise. I find myself in a setting that reminds me that my actions may be leading me somewhere that could have consequences of which I may not like.

I've never heard of seizures being related. As I got older and the deja vu became less frequent I began to believe that it was just anxiety. I've seen therapists, psychiatrists, and psychologists, all but the psychiatrist said I was fine. The psychiatrist just wanted to put me on the medication, but I adamantly said no to that. She tried to sneak Wellbutrin to me as a smoking cessation aid, and when I found that out I told her to bugger off and never went back.

I'll look into the seizure thing, but I never had any sort of seizure that I can recall. From what I know people who have seizures don't recall it happening, and the closet thing I had was a singular incident of night paralysis that I remained cognizant throughout."

Borderlands,fenjk17,t3_eq0v30,1579286062.0,"People talking about how issues don't get fixed in a day or weeks.

This game has had the same issues for months. Even when they ""fixed"" issues they weren't real fixes. I remember months ago when they said they fixed the menu lag, and people were still having issues with it if not worse issues. People are still having issues that GB said were fixed months ago.

This game has been out since September. They nerfed the crap out of Zane almost immediately. It took months for people to enjoy playing as him in Mayhem. They nerfed the crap out of Fl4k after that, then Moze. Amara was left untouched for a long time.

It almost makes me think that their idea of balancing is to keep making characters and items stronger and weaker to push people to keep using different builds in a way to promote grinding and ""build diversity.""

They don't care about the hard issues, because it's not important to them because people STILL keep playing the game.

People would have their banks and even characters deleted and people would just start all over.

I haven't played BL3 since November, and seeing all the same issues still there gives me no reason to want to pick it back up.

Quit being suckers and just stop playing it. Eventually Gearbox may get serious about fixing these issues instead of ""balancing.""

Play a different game. There's plenty of them out there, and you more than likely aren't going to miss out on anything from BL3.

Look even for next Halloween it's probably just going to be farming Haunt all over again for the same items we were getting last Halloween."
