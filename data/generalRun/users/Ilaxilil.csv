DebateVaccines,ffb3az6,t3_eryxjk,1579750704.0,"First, you are in the wrong subreddit for a balanced view on this topic. This subreddit is full of anti-vaccinators who will inform you not to vaccinate your child. There are of course some minimal risks to any medical procedure, but in the case of vaccination, the benefits far outweigh the risks. It’s about the equivalent of a rain shower vs. a hurricane or a tsunami. A rain shower might make you a little uncomfortable, but a natural disaster will destroy homes and end lives. You also have to consider the health of others. There are people who cannot be vaccinated and rely on the people around them to be vaccinated to prevent the spread of a disease. A healthy young person might not think they need the protection, but the elderly people, pregnant women, immune compromised people, and children around him certainly do."
