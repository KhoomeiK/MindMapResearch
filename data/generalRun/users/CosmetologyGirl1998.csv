creepyencounters,ff87qpn,t3_es6f4z,1579668411.0,Oh god no! That’s the last thing I would want to do. He wanted me to spend the night at his house and then he wanted to come to my house to sleep over and he asked if my family would be cool with it and I said no
thatjusthappened,ff833w5,t1_ff5n200,1579664713.0,What’s the smile for? Was that you saying those things?
LetsNotMeet,ff5zxq5,t1_ff5iepn,1579615523.0,I normally Skype with people when I’m talking to them to see if we get along and when he Skyped me it was just very strange
LetsNotMeet,ff5zty5,t1_ff5iunv,1579615435.0,How am I weird about posting my experience here!?
LetsNotMeet,ff5i3fw,t1_ff5hzad,1579593881.0,I do appreciate you’re feedback though
LetsNotMeet,ff5i2o9,t1_ff5hzad,1579593853.0,He started off normal and I usually Skype with people I’m talking to but further into the convo he just got creepy and immediately gave me bad vibes. He wasn’t initially creeping on me but after a while he started to
LetsNotMeet,ff5hn0d,t3_erqrho,1579593286.0,I have now blocked this person who has been trolling me in the comments
LetsNotMeet,ff5h05h,t3_erqrho,1579592465.0,"Who ever is the person trolling me in the comments I would appreciate it, if you’d stop. Thank you"
LetsNotMeet,ff5g99a,t3_erqrho,1579591539.0,I’m saying umm in front of it because it was a very strange experience and I’m still not sure how to process what happened
creepyasterisks,ff57yk6,t1_ff57soo,1579582888.0,"I’m not upset about the backlash, I’m upset at the fact that everyone was making me sound like a joke. For me, I believed it was creepy for that person to message me like that."
creepyasterisks,ff56d2a,t1_ff54zhs,1579581505.0,But it doesn’t involve anyone else. I believed it to be creepy because it was right away. And now my post has been deleted due to these people making me look like a joke. I don’t believe that was fair
creepyasterisks,ff4zg6r,t1_ff4z6h0,1579576180.0,It’s my right to post
JustBootThings,ff4cr50,t1_feruf6c,1579560548.0,No one cares
creepyasterisks,ff4clc3,t1_ff426t1,1579560448.0,How about you mind your own damn business?
creepyasterisks,ff3sr68,t1_ff3sozz,1579548050.0,"I didn’t say it was bad, I just thought it was creepy to me. I’m not into it."
creepyPMs,ff2cy6m,t3_eqyfqr,1579501148.0,Umm I don’t see anything wrong with my post at all. There is no identifying info at all. Everything is blurred out
niceguys,ff1pjwm,t3_eqychv,1579483320.0,And actually NO ALWAYS MEANS NO!
niceguys,ff1phv5,t3_eqychv,1579483283.0,He’s definitely got a SJW complex. That’s bad
creepyPMs,feviwxk,t3_epnk39,1579397949.0,I don’t have a lot to work with on my phone. Not everyone can use the full blackout censors
creepyPMs,fesji73,t3_epnk39,1579365839.0,What do you mean I didn’t censor it well? That makes no sense. I did fix it. I took out any identifying information. If you look at it throughly I didn’t show his picture or where he lives or what his name is. So I would like you to take another look. Thanks
niceguys,fepml7v,t3_eq6c4r,1579324506.0,Lol amen to that
creepyPMs,fepdywu,t1_fepdaxh,1579318155.0,Yeah I agree
creepyPMs,fepctgw,t1_fepcq05,1579317367.0,What do you mean? I don’t really understand. I just want you to elaborate a bit.
creepyPMs,fepbvdn,t1_fepbmdb,1579316730.0,"It was just weird the way he asked me. And then the first message when he said something about play fights, I wasn’t really paying attention. But after I went back and read it, it came off as creepy. And then about the balls thing, that was weird."
niceguys,fepbo8g,t3_eq6c4r,1579316596.0,So he thought because he was “hot” that she was intimidated and scared? Being hot and whatever is not gonna get him anywhere in life. I’m pretty sure this was just him trolling you.
creepyPMs,fepb9tb,t1_felowwt,1579316330.0,Pretty much. But he was also asking if I’ve ever grabbed someone’s balls or if I’ve ever hit someone in the balls before. It was weird
creepyPMs,fepb61j,t1_felkq7s,1579316261.0,When you’re an outgoing person you always want to give the benefit of the doubt. Doesn’t always apply to everyone
creepyPMs,fepb3zg,t1_felnj6n,1579316221.0,"I wasn’t interested in him. I simply said I like redheads, the more I talked to him, the weirder it got."
creepyPMs,fepb1ad,t1_fell86y,1579316171.0,"I always use exclamation points when I am greeting someone or just make friendly conversation to show that I’m an outgoing person. I wasn’t interested in him, all I said was that I like redheads. It wasn’t saying that I was interested"
creepyPMs,fepawub,t1_fell1nf,1579316088.0,It was further down in the chat but I wanted to show that his first message to me was a little weird
creepyPMs,fepasjh,t3_epnk39,1579316006.0,I never said I was interested in him. I just said I liked redheads. That doesn’t mean I was interested
creepyPMs,fepap1f,t3_epnk39,1579315940.0,Kinda. Haha. He was asking me about hitting him in the nuts and if I’ve ever grabbed or hit someone in the nuts before
creepyPMs,feki6a6,t3_epa2yv,1579200552.0,"Hypothetical Nudity Guy is the weirdest dude. Clearly the girls you message aren’t going to want to swim naked with you, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE FRIENDS! THATS WEIRD!!!!!"
niceguys,fekh3jd,t3_epekm5,1579199912.0,Yeah I don’t understand what the necessity is for them getting so angry.
niceguys,fejvsvm,t3_ep6yvs,1579187000.0,Have a “Nice Guy” mentality isn’t worth it. Having a “Nice Guy” complex DEFINITELY isn’t worth.
niceguys,fejvd2l,t3_episxp,1579186714.0,I’m pretty sure being a Nice Guy didn’t work for drake. I think it almost got him arrested a couple of times. And I’m pretty this guy saying he wanted to be with this girl because he was almost 21 didn’t make any sense to whatsoever.
niceguys,fejv2dl,t1_feju43q,1579186516.0,It’s like they expect you go wait for them or something. NO GIRLS WILL EVER GO OUT WITH A SELF PROCLAIMED NICE GUY.
niceguys,fejtaov,t3_epekm5,1579185325.0,"Why does he think that sending a pic will make her reconsider? Does he just assume that “oh if I send her a picture of my dick and say I’m not trying to hook up with her, she’ll like me.” Yeah...that’s not how that works buddy."
niceguys,fejse3y,t1_feiflwy,1579184685.0,Nice guys don’t get the hint. Nor do they understand it doesn’t make you less of a virgin if you have tattoos. I think it weird that he’s asking some random girl if she’s a virgin. Creeper much?
niceguys,fee2ri2,t3_eoomcv,1579025194.0,Haha I tried to censor it the best I could
niceguys,fee19gq,t3_eoomcv,1579024293.0,I gave him my number originally to talk to him to get to know him but I just wasn’t interested after talking to him.
neckbeard,f60vwej,t3_dmplgg,1572627235.0,"Yeah with neckbeards and legbeards, they usually tend to smell horrible or they will try to fight for your honor if they think someone (usually a guy that he calls a chad” or for a legbeard, she usually wants lots of attention)will end up telling him/her to fuck off and that is usually never the end of it."
