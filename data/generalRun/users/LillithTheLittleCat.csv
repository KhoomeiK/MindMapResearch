unpopularopinion,ffbxvnb,t1_ffb3le2,1579786273.0,So you like the fully-retarded type of vegans that feed their cats a vegan diet and kill them?
mildlyinfuriating,ffbkgul,t1_ffbgwl5,1579769606.0,I also worked in retail in europe during university but i never experienced anything even close to the situation in the picture. The worst I've seen were some unfolded shirts(which is no problem as we had a folding technique we had to use that no customer used).
mildlyinfuriating,ffbjuz3,t1_ffbivdi,1579768739.0,The Primark where I live doesn't have that problem. It's not as clean and orderly as other stores but not even close to stuff lying on the floor.
starterpacks,ff8yiv7,t1_ff8vmjb,1579700145.0,dont't forget the extreme teeth bleaching which will look kinda weird and try-hard almost everywhere except for the usa.
AmItheAsshole,ff5vksb,t1_ff5tb46,1579611738.0,Yeah but not herpes(first type). I only learned about herpes being a stigmatized STD from reddit. I(and everyone else in my country) always saw it as just a Virus as you can get it through various ways or even from birth on.
AMA,ff3vmny,t1_ff3ia47,1579549832.0,Or the Hobbit and lord of the rings?
TheGlowUp,fewxiz9,t3_eqqurb,1579421007.0,It depends on where you live. Where I live no one will approach you in day to day life no matter how stunning you look.
Cringetopia,fettk10,t1_fepjtbp,1579379907.0,Normally the people are really nice and try to give advice. Of course a few super edgelords always have to be especially cruel but I'm afraid these are everywhere.
Cringetopia,fett8xd,t1_fetsdj2,1579379803.0,I'm sorry this happened to you... I guess they just thought it's easy karma as this is (no offense) surely not your most flattering picture. I tried to find the post but it seems as if it has been deleted.
Cringetopia,fets274,t1_fetrk3l,1579379331.0,Yes I think it was but I only skimmed the comments so I don't know if he also answered in your name.
Cringetopia,fetr9jr,t1_fetcxes,1579378778.0,That's you? Yes I saw this picture there a few months ago...
galaxybuds,feny74u,t3_eq5ec4,1579292580.0,I don't press them inside but more like.. turn them inside like a screw? Sounds weird but that's how I got the best sound without ear pain.
EuroSkincare,fenilqo,t3_eq3mhz,1579285480.0,Deciem has a store finder online I think it should show you german shops that sell it.
Cringetopia,feni9hq,t1_fen74j2,1579285269.0,He also was on r/AmIUgly
europe,femk98q,t1_femjcen,1579259807.0,What? Is that not how these peasants get through life? Phew who could have know that? Good thing he's our chancellor with all that insight in normal peoples life.

wholesomememes,fema4ak,t1_feli3jq,1579245519.0,No it's called FitInn
wholesomememes,fekly9a,t1_fekkqe9,1579202804.0,One example: yesterday at the gym I saw a woman(most likely a newbie) that used the leg press and locked her knees. I told her she should be careful to not lock her knees. She was thankful and that was it. What I want to say: there are a few basics that everyone can tell you without being a professional.
LifeProTips,fejlgvf,t3_ephnz3,1579178905.0,"But with this medal you can use the coins you already have in your account for a good cause and it helps keeping reddit afloat as I guess server, developer... too cost money"
galaxybuds,fejjuyp,t3_epfvoo,1579177263.0,You can use them but Ambient Sound and the equalizer won't work(at least with my normal Galaxy Watch)
unpopularopinion,fee7l77,t1_fedx6bn,1579028046.0,But you realise that this won't work for everyone right? I mean..  do you think teens get pregnant because they like it? I'm quite sure most of the time it's just because they were uneducated but still horny which is completely normal so stop trying to shame people for their needs.
unpopularopinion,fee77bm,t1_fedwuop,1579027819.0,I don't have any kids nor do I want any and I live in a country with cheap BC/abortion and it works pretty good. I just don't want kids to grow up I misery because their parents were uneducated/poor.
unpopularopinion,fedvjl4,t1_fedus9t,1579020794.0,Yeah let's tell horny teens to stop having sex. I'm sure that will work out great. Sex is a human need and you can cry all you want but people won't stop satisfying their needs if they have the possibility to so the next logical step would be to help everyone do this in a safe way.
facepalm,fedca0y,t1_fed9xbd,1579007372.0,This sounds absolutely horrible... I hope he is doing ok!
facepalm,fedc62h,t1_fed8xqz,1579007274.0,"God damn I am a woman so no need to ""interact with more real women"". How is being stronger relevant when two intoxicated people have sex? No one denies that it is rape if he uses this strength to get what he wants but it is absolutely shitty of you to act like ""oh but we woman are soooooo weak so we almost can't rape man."" I just hope you know this is a disgusting lie and are just bored."
facepalm,fed8pfl,t1_fed89rn,1579003855.0,"Even if you obviously would like to believe it, woman are not completely stupid/weak and can manage a lot of stuff alone and yes they also can kidnap someone. You don't even have to be strong, just surprise the individual and shove them in a car or drug them or use a weapon. Woman are no saints just like man and can do horrible things which a normal person wouldn't be able to do."
SkincareAddiction,fecuvvw,t1_fecpan7,1578985560.0,Same. It was ok before I stopped smoking or started skincare and it is ok now. Guess that's  just the most my skin can do
IncelsInAction,feawgm5,t3_eo6aru,1578952890.0,"Well of course adult men have it worse in society than underage girls. Being adult is kinda lame, no surprise here."
Instagramreality,fe90pz0,t1_fe86jny,1578932915.0,"Unfortunately I don't know her stance on the whole photoshop/perfection thematic so I can't really answer this but it is at least possible. There are many female celebrities that talk about their photos getting retouched without their permission and how they are annoyed with the ""perfect image"" of them."
Instagramreality,fe84p77,t1_fe6tlcj,1578922532.0,I'm not sure if this is her fault. I doubt that her social media accounts are really run by her.
Instagramreality,fe84cy1,t3_eny3c8,1578922405.0,"I almost started to cry when I sat in the cinema and watched hustlers and this 50ish yr old woman steps on the stage AND LOOKS LIKE A FUCKING 20 YEAR OLD. I was devastated and maybe cursed my parents for the ""bad genes""."
unpopularopinion,fdov8zd,t3_emc6pg,1578613650.0,I only wear oversized pullovers or cardigans to work because of this. So I can use the sleeves to open doors. People are so disgusting. I'm always astonished.
Dinosaurs,fdo28zv,t1_fdnvff5,1578597555.0,Well tell her she did an amazing job!
Dinosaurs,fdnnz34,t3_emb80e,1578589709.0,That's such a cute idea! Happy birthday!
MovieDetails,fdn0awm,t1_fdmx348,1578573258.0,wrong thread?

Botchedsurgeries,fdmr927,t1_fdmme01,1578561835.0,OMG a woman with hair on her face!!1! How horrible and unnatural!
AmItheAsshole,fdju6q4,t1_fdjpksd,1578487618.0,Getting naked -> depends on the culture but wanting(almost insisting) to strip is a different thing and a kinda bad sign.
collapse,fdjoj62,t3_elnhfk,1578480953.0,"I got 1 Earths(yes it's still earths somehow). But it's easy for me as i live in a city, have perfect public transport in almost the whole country and grew up with a mum that was a very responsible buyer(only local, seasonal stuff)"
aww,fdjkq39,t1_fdj7qjk,1578475468.0,But watching out for pets wouldn't bring these sweet internet points. Seems to be way more fun to let them get fat or make weird stunts for our amusement.
AskReddit,fd4gk4w,t1_fd3ov3p,1578167313.0,Do you wear adidas pants while doing that?
Austria,fcys7j6,t1_fcy7a9w,1578085953.0,Oh sorry dachte du meinst das alle die es nicht (mehr) betrifft nicht abstimmen dürfen sollten(gibt ja genug die das so sehen). Ja ich war damals in der Berufsschule und da durfte auch kaum wer abstimmen obwohl all die Jungs den Blödsinn noch vor sich hatten somit voll betroffen waren...
Austria,fcxihgp,t1_fcxi39f,1578063759.0,"Ich finde es richtig das alle abstimmen durften. Was mich geschockt hat ist einfach wie dermaßen gehässig unsere Gesellschaft anscheinend ist. Die Leute wussten alle wie arg das teilweise abläuft und Stimmen trotzdem dafür weil ""IcH hAb dAS DamAlS auCh GeScHaffT!!1 Charakterbildung!1!!"". Ist doch echter Dreck diese Politik :("
collapse,fcxi6ar,t1_fcxhim0,1578063539.0,"So as I understand it now it's a mix of greedy, disgusting politicians and climate change. I will never understand how a person can be so damn greedy that they would just sell the live of their own people for EVEN MORE money(not like these guys start out poor). It makes me really feel powerless... I see what they do and can do absolutely nothing. Why, oh why do people keep voting for these greedy company owned assholes?"
Austria,fcxhouv,t1_fcxgs36,1578063190.0,Absolut abartig das sowas in diesen Zeiten immer noch möglich ist bei uns... ist mir echt unbegreiflich das da keiner was macht. Es wird ja auch von unseren super Politikern eigentlich nie angesprochen(maximal die Wehrdiener und auch da nix sinnvolles) und wenn doch dann einfach der Verweis das man da nix machen muss da ja damals vom Volk entschieden wurde das wir das gerne alles so haben möchten...
Austria,fcxfgp2,t3_ejfnyq,1578061547.0,"Kann man sich aussuchen wo man Zivildienst macht? Wenn ja sollte man echt ne Seite machen wo alle aufgelistet werden die ihre Zivis wie Dreck behandeln und denen gehört echt der Nachschub an neuen ""Opfern"" abgedreht. Ich hab da schon so viele arge Geschichten gehört von machtgeilen Idioten die all ihren Frust an Zivis auslassen weil die sich einfach an keinen wenden können und eigentlich nur legale Untermindestlohn-sklaven sind."
collapse,fcxf5r7,t3_ejenbp,1578061318.0,Why did the australian wildfires get so out of control this/last year? Had a discussion with a colleague about it today and said I think it's from climate change. He said that's not true because they had these fires almost every year(just smaller) and I didn't really know what to say afterwards.
Botchedsurgeries,fcuoq3u,t3_ej066f,1577985465.0,But it looks ok not really botched I think.. yeah it's the same as every instagram girls nose/lip out there but I think this is the result she wanted
