AndrewGosden,ffgh34a,t1_fff0uvg,1579906082.0,"Sure, they normally would. It's not unheard of for murderers to keep trophies or souvenirs from their crimes. This tends to be more common with serial killers, however.

It could also be a thing related to the motive of the murder. Was it specifically that they got off on killing Andrew or was it that it was a theft gone wrong? If the murderer was mostly just looking to steal Andrew's wallet and PSP, it might make sense to keep the PSP for a while before pawning it off. In that kind of circumstance, I can see someone throwing it in a drawer somewhere for a few years and either forgetting they had it or forgetting where they put it.

AndrewGosden,ffehukc,t3_ess73k,1579848606.0,"> Secondly that if he isn't alive, the PSP was sold on and not disposed of (if someone killed him, they would likely want to dispose of any evidence).

I'm not sure if I entirely agree with this assumption. If someone had murdered Andrew Gosden, it might have made sense to keep the PSP for a while. Push comes to shove, it might not have been too difficult to get a replacement charger for it (remember, Anrew left his at home), and maybe a couple of games for it. 

I mean, it's not like it'd be hard to explain away the possession of a PSP. You could just say you like handheld gaming or you wanted to get into it if anyone asked. With the exception of a cop being there to literally examine the serial number, nobody would really know any better.

The most you'd really have to do to hide it, if you really wanted to hide it, would be to stick it at the bottom of a box filled with other stuff. It's not necessarily something you'd dispose of straight away unless you put it in the same area you put the body.

Honestly, I think if Andrew was murdered, the PSP might be something it'd make sense to keep, at least for a few years. You wouldn't necessarily get rid of it straight away in case it got found if you just dumped it somewhere. You wouldn't necessarily want to bury it with him either because it'd be an easy way to identify him even if you couldn't identify the face.

I can definitely see a scenario where a guy murders Andrew, keeps the PSP, and then years later, tries to sell it on eBay without the knowledge of their SO or flatmates."
AndrewGosden,ffeh06e,t1_ffd2f0n,1579847652.0,"> As it seems likely this PSP has never connected to the internet in the last 12 years this may indicate the that PSP may have been destroyed, or at least that it is unlikely that it has been sold on.

I think this is a thing that could go either way. 

Connecting to the internet off a PSP to use or set up a PlayStation Network account might have made sense if you bought a secondhand PSP in 2007 or 2008. But even then, it'd mostly make sense if you were interested in the online social aspect of games. 

Plus if it was bought by a parent for a younger kid at the time, there might not be as much incentive for the parent to either allow the kid to set up an account or to set one up for them, depending on how strict they were with their kids' internet access at the time.

If it was bought secondhand relatively soon after Andrew's disappearance, I think it's a fifty-fifty thing, just depending on the circumstances of who bought it. 

If it'd been bought secondhand relatively recently, I don't see why they'd bother. There hasn't been a game released for the PSP in years, so it's not like you'd have an account to buy new games for the console. You'd probably just buy the games secondhand online off eBay or something.

Keep in mind, this is just me spitballing. I'm not much of a gamer personally."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffeeu1u,t1_ffdxxy5,1579845341.0,"> The longer kids are kept in the industry and the more exposed they are/less of a normal live they live they worse off they seem to be.

I tend to agree. Even kids who were only in the spotlight for a relatively short time seem to have periods where they go off the rails. 

For example, Brian Bonsall, who was in the spotlight for less than a decade as Andy on *Family Ties* and later as Alexander on *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, had a period in the late '00s where he was having issues with law enforcement. It might not have been directly related to his experiences on TV as a child, but I have to wonder if it was at least indirectly related."

DaystromInstitute,ffdfxvz,t1_ffdfev0,1579820052.0,"Sure, but Vulcans (and, by extension, probably their offshoots) live for 200+ years and, at least going by how Tuvok looks in *Voyager* and how T'Pol looks in *Enterprise*, seem to age much slower than humans. So I wouldn't be surprised if their birth rate was much lower than human birth rates as well just due to how long they live--they wouldn't necessarily see it as a biological or social imperative to reproduce in their twenties or thirties the same way humans do."
DaystromInstitute,ffdems5,t1_ffcl0e0,1579819264.0,"Yeah, and that interview scene eased one of my greatest concerns about what the show was going to be like. A lot of the promotional material was saying Picard was going to be a very different man in this show, so I was worried that they were going to completely scrap who he was in TNG for convenience's sake.

That didn't really pan out, though. In terms of his core values, Picard is still quite similar in this show."
DaystromInstitute,ffded34,t1_ffco4w3,1579819105.0,"Yeah, but don't forget that the Romulans didn't initially evolve on Romulus; they evolved on Vulcan and then moved to Romulus. In the 2,000 or so years that they were on Romulus, they might not have had the time to have a population of seven or eight billion on Romulus alone, plus they could have had any number of colony worlds around the place.

In fact, I'd argue it's almost certain that they had at least some colony worlds. In *Gambit* Part II, there's mention of an offshoot of the Romulans called the Debrune. This would imply that the Romulans would set up colony worlds at least sometimes."
DaystromInstitute,ffddm37,t1_ffdbmts,1579818659.0,"> I think the the xenophobia we see the news interviewer exhibit may be part of a trend we saw developing in DS9.

This is a fair point, but on the other hand, there's always been a certain level of paranoia about the Romulans within the Federation. In *Balance of Terror*, Lieutenant Stiles is so paranoid about the Romulans that he suspects Spock of being a Romulan spy once it's revealed Vulcans and Romulans have a shared heritage.

This is a trend that continues into the twenty-fourth century. When the Romulan warbird first starts to decloak and then recloak in *The Neutral Zone*, Riker's first instinct is to want to open fire (though you can argue this was somewhat justified because it wasn't immediately clear the Romulans weren't looking for a fight). Later on in *The Drumhead*, Norah Satie focuses in on Crewman Tarses, who's a quarter Romulan.

While the Dominion War might have made these xenophobic tendencies more transparent, there was always a certain amount of anti-Romulan sentiment in the Federation. Plus I wouldn't be too surprised if the events of *Nemesis*, where Shinzon attempts a coup and to mount an invasion of the Federation, helped ease these sentiments, even if he was mostly backed by the Remans."
startrek,ffbteox,t1_ffbmscr,1579782075.0,"Yes, I agree. I used to think *The Cage*, *Where No Man Has Gone Before* and *The Caretaker* were my favourite Trek pilots, but this one was even better."
startrek,ffbt40o,t1_ffbmoih,1579781765.0,"Honestly, the more cynical part of me kind of wonders if this informed his decision to come back to Star Trek. He's a little too old to be doing heavy action scenes now, so it's not like he's likely to get a high paying main role in an action series like *X-Men* again."
DaystromInstitute,ffbsxvz,t1_ffbssk9,1579781576.0,"Yeah, fair enough. I think that plan would also depend on how dependent Romulans were on Reman labour on their ships, especially their military ships, though they wouldn't have much military left after that."

It's never made explicit in alpha canon (with the exception of the Vulcan Science Academy, which runs a small science fleet), but there is sometimes reference to it in the beta canon novels from the '80s and '90s. 

*Death Count* specifically features the Andorian Reserve Fleet, which is supposed to act as an auxiliary force to Starfleet when needed. Stuff like this is never brought up in the alpha canon though, and probably for good reason.

I wouldn't be too surprised if pretty much every Federation member had its own fleetyards, especially if they've only recently joined."
DaystromInstitute,ffbsds8,t1_ffbkrk3,1579780939.0,"> I think Maddox must have had custody of Lal's remains.

Would he have needed Lal's remains specifically? Lore's positronic net was supposed to be identical, and it's possible Data donated a few neurons to Maddox prior to his death."
DaystromInstitute,ffbsbh9,t1_ffblodl,1579780865.0,I've been saying the same. It's a shame that we didn't see them developed more when they still had an empire and were a major power. It'd be good to be able to contrast how they were at the height of their power to how they are as a vastly weakened society.
DaystromInstitute,ffbs4v1,t1_ffbpo3w,1579780651.0,It's also known that Data kept in touch with Maddox for at least a couple of years after the trial--the letter in *Data's Day* was to Maddox. He would have been going off several years of personal interactions with Data for his research.
DaystromInstitute,ffbrz6x,t1_ffbiwdl,1579780462.0,"Perhaps parts of Data were found immediately after the battle against the *Scimitar*. They'd probably have been found by a Romulan crew though, as I believe the battle itself still happened within Romulan territory. 

Depending on what condition Lore's body was in, it might have been possible to recreate a Soong-type, or at least a Soong-esque, style positronic net. With the right connections, you'd have access to the B-4 prototype, Lore's body, plus Data's blueprints for Lal."
DaystromInstitute,ffbhqg5,t1_ffad0hn,1579765837.0,"The Son'a were using slaves to help crew their starships in *Insurrection*. In fact, this might be the one time when it's known there's multiple slave races--the Son'a had enslaved the Ellora and the Tarlac. I think *Insurrection* might have politely called them ""indentured servants"" though.

The Cardassians were using Bajoran slave labour to build Deep Space Nine (or Terok Nor at the time) as well as to work the mine processing facility. It's not known if Bajoran slaves were ever used as labour on military ships.

in *Nemesis* it's stated that the Romulans were using Remans as shock troops during the Dominion War. While it's never directly said that they were used to crew warbirds as well, I think there probably were times when this happened.

There's definitely times when space faring races have actively used slave labour on starships and space stations to some extent or another in Star Trek."

DaystromInstitute,ff8ojka,t1_ff8ntnc,1579689018.0,"> ...and have their own replicators...

I wanted to disagree with you here because of [that one bit from *Samaritan Snare*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjR08nB9rZ4), but I don't hear any replicator sound effects in the clip and it's not really clear where a replicator would fit on a type seven shuttlecraft. You've got me here."
startrek,ff4yn1a,t3_ero7cs,1579575606.0,"I think to some extent, the shows have always been hidden behind a paywall. At least here in Australia, the case has been (at least in the last twenty years or so) that if you wanted to see all the Trek shows regularly, you either had to own them on DVD/Bluray or you had to have pay TV. 

While the shows would air on free-to-air television, the episodes would sometimes be played at odd times, and it'd usually only be one series at a time. On the flipside, Trek would typically air at a consistent time on pay TV. While stuff like that might not be considered a paywall in the modern online sense of the term, I think you can argue it's still a paywall.

I'm not entirely convinced streaming by itself will be a horrible thing for Trek, at least in the short term. Paying for Netflix (which is where *Discovery* and the other Trek shows have been hosted outside of the US) and for Amazon Prime (which is where *Picard* will be hosted for some reason) is cheaper than paying Foxtel for pay TV.

I think the bigger issue is going to come from having different shows being hosted on different streaming services. In the United States, I believe most of the Trek shows are on Netflix while the newer shows are being put onto CBS All Access, while internationally every show except *Picard* will be on Netflix. 

Stuff like that is going to make it more difficult for newer fans to get into the franchise, especially given the timeline of where each show fits can be a little complicated at times."
harrypotter,ff4x745,t3_ernvbi,1579574600.0,"I think that, at least when he was at Hogwarts, Ron's parents probably just saw him as playing second fiddle to Harry or Hermione as well. When he going off and saving the school, he was usually doing it in conjunction with Harry or Hermione.

But if it was part of some guy's VFX reel that they put together to show off their skills, I think it'd be a bit lackluster by itself. I think it'd have to be done as part of a larger series debunking various known hoaxes and showing how it could have been done."

DaystromInstitute,ff2p9cx,t1_ff2i872,1579517575.0,"[According to Memory Alpha](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Galaxy_class), the *Galaxy*-class can have a crew of up to 6,000 and has a maximum capacity of 15,000 people in the prime timeline. At least in the prime timeline, a single *Galaxy*-class could potentially be landing 4,000-10,000 troops on any given planet. It's never been made entirely clear what the crew compliment or maximum load of people of the *Sovereign*-class is, either in canon or in any of the tech manuals. 

This could easily be another reason to have a *Galaxy*-class over a *Sovereign*. The *Galaxy* can carry so many people that it makes a potential ground invasion easier, but the *Sovereign* might not be optimal for that."

DaystromInstitute,ff15jtr,t3_er28sq,1579475454.0,"There are some benefits to a *Galaxy*-class. One is the amount of internal space available for the class--even the *Sovereign*-class wasn't quite as big. Because of this, a *Galaxy*-class had a lot more space to pick up survivors from other ships that had been destroyed or to carry engineering crews that could help repair damaged ships.

The *Sovereign*-class was also a very new class of ship when the war broke out. As far as we know in alpha canon, there could have only been two of these ships completed by the end of the war--the *Enterprise*-E and the *Sovereign*. Because the class was so new, it could have still been quite difficult to build them because they incorporated so much new technology.

Plus, I suspect that the *Sovereign*s were rolled out a little earlier than previously planned due to the Dominion threat. This would explain why the *Enterprise*-E seems to have undergone a refit between *First Contact* and *Insurrection*, and then another prior to *Nemesis*. Because of this, the first few *Sovereign*s could have been intended to be a propaganda ship to some extent: even though the Federation was in crisis, look at this wonderful new capital ship they can build.

But that's another benefit of the *Galaxy*-class. They'd been around for a while, so most of the kinks had been worked out. While they did add a couple of phaser strips on the warp nacelles for the Dominion War, it was still essentially the same ship they'd been using for a while at this point. They could build a bunch of them and send them out without fail. They couldn't necessarily do that with the *Sovereign* because the systems were mostly brand new so could fail due to unforeseen circumstances. 

I think that, after the Dominion War, Starfleet probably rolled out a lot of new *Sovereign*-class ships. The kinks in most of the technology would have been worked out by then because of its incorporation into other classes, and it'd make some sense for it to be the new major capital ship due to how many *Galaxy* and *Excelsior* class ships had been lost in the war."

DaystromInstitute,fefetkl,t3_eoss8h,1579054812.0,"As other people have noted, it's probably because the Bajoran Militia didn't really care too much about Starfleet rank conventions and were mostly carrying on an older tradition that existed prior to the Cardassian occupation.

In Bajoran culture, they may not have seen it necessary to have a different naming scheme for army ranks and navy ranks. A major in the army would be the equivalent of a major in the navy to them. This wouldn't be totally unprecedented, though certainly it'd be considered abnormal, on Earth: while most country's air forces use a different list of names for their ranks, the US Air Force's rank titles are the same as those for the US Army.

As for why Kira would be allowed to serve under Sisko, it's a matter of how they'd think about it. Kira wouldn't see it as an army officer serving under a navy officer; she'd see it as a member of the Bajoran Militia serving under a Starfleet officer on a joint operation base. 

She'd understand that while their rank conventions were different, she'd still be operating with the same kind of authority as a lieutenant commander in Starfleet would when it came to her interactions with Starfleet personnel on the station. So when it came to her actual rank, she knew it didn't matter as much as the authority she'd be allowed to operate with.

Plus, on Bajor, the space-faring military may have traditionally been a part of their ground army rather than the navy or the air force. After all, here on Earth, armies operate helicopters and transport planes; the Bajorans might have seen their first few space faring vessels to just be an extension of vehicles like that.

While Kira may have been a low-level operative in the Resistance, her rank may have been indicative of her leadership skills and her operational skills. It easily could have been that she focused mostly on leading troops into special operations missions rather than larger battles. 

Due to this special operations experience, it could be that the Provisional Government felt it necessary to skew her rank higher. The US Army's Delta Force tends to mostly recruit officers at the rank of captain or major for example, and enlisted men tend to have been recruited between the ranks of E4 and E8. Depending on what Bajor's military tradition looks like, they could have given her the rank of major for similar reasons.

As for why she was never a lieutenant colonel, I think the reason is that there isn't a rank of lieutenant colonel in the Bajoran Militia. While the roles of each rank in the Militia will resemble those in Earth's armies, it's not always a 1:1 thing. The authority of any given rank could be at least partially based on how long they've held it.

There was no explicit reason given for this, but it's implied there isn't a lieutenant colonel rank. There hadn't been any lieutenant colonels shown on the show prior to this, so the rank wasn't an established part of the Bajoran Militia's chain of command. 

When Kira is shown in a Starfleet uniform towards the end of season seven, she's wearing a commander's rank insignia, so I think it's safe to assume it's a direct promotion, though. That'd make sense given the chain of command we'd seen previously: Kira had been acting as Sisko's first officer for the entire show, so she'd been acting with the authority of a lieutenant commander for the most part."

I'm not sure if I entirely agree with this assumption. If someone had murdered Andrew Gosden, it might have made sense to keep the PSP for a while. Push comes to shove, it might not have been too difficult to get a replacement charger for it (remember, Anrew left his at home), and maybe a couple of games for it. 

I mean, it's not like it'd be hard to explain away the possession of a PSP. You could just say you like handheld gaming or you wanted to get into it if anyone asked. With the exception of a cop being there to literally examine the serial number, nobody would really know any better.

The most you'd really have to do to hide it, if you really wanted to hide it, would be to stick it at the bottom of a box filled with other stuff. It's not necessarily something you'd dispose of straight away unless you put it in the same area you put the body.

Honestly, I think if Andrew was murdered, the PSP might be something it'd make sense to keep, at least for a few years. You wouldn't necessarily get rid of it straight away in case it got found if you just dumped it somewhere. You wouldn't necessarily want to bury it with him either because it'd be an easy way to identify him even if you couldn't identify the face.

I can definitely see a scenario where a guy murders Andrew, keeps the PSP, and then years later, tries to sell it on eBay without the knowledge of their SO or flatmates."
AndrewGosden,ffeh06e,t1_ffd2f0n,1579847652.0,"> As it seems likely this PSP has never connected to the internet in the last 12 years this may indicate the that PSP may have been destroyed, or at least that it is unlikely that it has been sold on.

I think this is a thing that could go either way. 

Connecting to the internet off a PSP to use or set up a PlayStation Network account might have made sense if you bought a secondhand PSP in 2007 or 2008. But even then, it'd mostly make sense if you were interested in the online social aspect of games. 

Plus if it was bought by a parent for a younger kid at the time, there might not be as much incentive for the parent to either allow the kid to set up an account or to set one up for them, depending on how strict they were with their kids' internet access at the time.

If it was bought secondhand relatively soon after Andrew's disappearance, I think it's a fifty-fifty thing, just depending on the circumstances of who bought it. 

If it'd been bought secondhand relatively recently, I don't see why they'd bother. There hasn't been a game released for the PSP in years, so it's not like you'd have an account to buy new games for the console. You'd probably just buy the games secondhand online off eBay or something.

I tend to agree. Even kids who were only in the spotlight for a relatively short time seem to have periods where they go off the rails. 

For example, Brian Bonsall, who was in the spotlight for less than a decade as Andy on *Family Ties* and later as Alexander on *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, had a period in the late '00s where he was having issues with law enforcement.

In the 2,000 or so years that they were on Romulus, they might not have had the time to have a population of seven or eight billion on Romulus alone, plus they could have had any number of colony worlds around the place.

In fact, I'd argue it's almost certain that they had at least some colony worlds. In *Gambit* Part II, there's mention of an offshoot of the Romulans called the Debrune. This would imply that the Romulans would set up colony worlds at least sometimes."
DaystromInstitute,ffddm37,t1_ffdbmts,1579818659.0,"> I think the the xenophobia we see the news interviewer exhibit may be part of a trend we saw developing in DS9.

This is a fair point, but on the other hand, there's always been a certain level of paranoia about the Romulans within the Federation. In *Balance of Terror*, Lieutenant Stiles is so paranoid about the Romulans that he suspects Spock of being a Romulan spy once it's revealed Vulcans and Romulans have a shared heritage.

This is a trend that continues into the twenty-fourth century. When the Romulan warbird first starts to decloak and then recloak in *The Neutral Zone*, Riker's first instinct is to want to open fire (though you can argue this was somewhat justified because it wasn't immediately clear the Romulans weren't looking for a fight). Later on in *The Drumhead*, Norah Satie focuses in on Crewman Tarses, who's a quarter Romulan.

While the Dominion War might have made these xenophobic tendencies more transparent, there was always a certain amount of anti-Romulan sentiment in the Federation.

startrek,ff4yn1a,t3_ero7cs,1579575606.0,"I think to some extent, the shows have always been hidden behind a paywall. At least here in Australia, the case has been (at least in the last twenty years or so) that if you wanted to see all the Trek shows regularly, you either had to own them on DVD/Bluray or you had to have pay TV. 

While the shows would air on free-to-air television, the episodes would sometimes be played at odd times, and it'd usually only be one series at a time. On the flipside, Trek would typically air at a consistent time on pay TV. While stuff like that might not be considered a paywall in the modern online sense of the term, I think you can argue it's still a paywall.

I'm not entirely convinced streaming by itself will be a horrible thing for Trek, at least in the short term. Paying for Netflix (which is where *Discovery* and the other Trek shows have been hosted outside of the US) and for Amazon Prime (which is where *Picard* will be hosted for some reason) is cheaper than paying Foxtel for pay TV.

I think the bigger issue is going to come from having different shows being hosted on different streaming services. In the United States, I believe most of the Trek shows are on Netflix while the newer shows are being put onto CBS All Access, while internationally every show except *Picard* will be on Netflix. 

Stuff like that is going to make it more difficult for newer fans to get into the franchise, especially given the timeline of where each show fits can be a little complicated at times."

DaystromInstitute,ff2p9cx,t1_ff2i872,1579517575.0,"[According to Memory Alpha](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Galaxy_class), the *Galaxy*-class can have a crew of up to 6,000 and has a maximum capacity of 15,000 people in the prime timeline. At least in the prime timeline, a single *Galaxy*-class could potentially be landing 4,000-10,000 troops on any given planet. It's never been made entirely clear what the crew compliment or maximum load of people of the *Sovereign*-class is, either in canon or in any of the tech manuals. 

This could easily be another reason to have a *Galaxy*-class over a *Sovereign*. The *Galaxy* can carry so many people that it makes a potential ground invasion easier, but the *Sovereign* might not be optimal for that."

DaystromInstitute,ff15jtr,t3_er28sq,1579475454.0,"There are some benefits to a *Galaxy*-class. One is the amount of internal space available for the class--even the *Sovereign*-class wasn't quite as big. Because of this, a *Galaxy*-class had a lot more space to pick up survivors from other ships that had been destroyed or to carry engineering crews that could help repair damaged ships.

The *Sovereign*-class was also a very new class of ship when the war broke out. As far as we know in alpha canon, there could have only been two of these ships completed by the end of the war--the *Enterprise*-E and the *Sovereign*. Because the class was so new, it could have still been quite difficult to build them because they incorporated so much new technology.

Plus, I suspect that the *Sovereign*s were rolled out a little earlier than previously planned due to the Dominion threat. This would explain why the *Enterprise*-E seems to have undergone a refit between *First Contact* and *Insurrection*, and then another prior to *Nemesis*. Because of this, the first few *Sovereign*s could have been intended to be a propaganda ship to some extent: even though the Federation was in crisis, look at this wonderful new capital ship they can build.

But that's another benefit of the *Galaxy*-class. They'd been around for a while, so most of the kinks had been worked out. While they did add a couple of phaser strips on the warp nacelles for the Dominion War, it was still essentially the same ship they'd been using for a while at this point. They could build a bunch of them and send them out without fail. They couldn't necessarily do that with the *Sovereign* because the systems were mostly brand new so could fail due to unforeseen circumstances. 

I think that, after the Dominion War, Starfleet probably rolled out a lot of new *Sovereign*-class ships. The kinks in most of the technology would have been worked out by then because of its incorporation into other classes, and it'd make some sense for it to be the new major capital ship due to how many *Galaxy* and *Excelsior* class ships had been lost in the war."

DaystromInstitute,fefetkl,t3_eoss8h,1579054812.0,"As other people have noted, it's probably because the Bajoran Militia didn't really care too much about Starfleet rank conventions and were mostly carrying on an older tradition that existed prior to the Cardassian occupation.

In Bajoran culture, they may not have seen it necessary to have a different naming scheme for army ranks and navy ranks. A major in the army would be the equivalent of a major in the navy to them. This wouldn't be totally unprecedented, though certainly it'd be considered abnormal, on Earth: while most country's air forces use a different list of names for their ranks, the US Air Force's rank titles are the same as those for the US Army.

As for why Kira would be allowed to serve under Sisko, it's a matter of how they'd think about it. Kira wouldn't see it as an army officer serving under a navy officer; she'd see it as a member of the Bajoran Militia serving under a Starfleet officer on a joint operation base. 

She'd understand that while their rank conventions were different, she'd still be operating with the same kind of authority as a lieutenant commander in Starfleet would when it came to her interactions with Starfleet personnel on the station. So when it came to her actual rank, she knew it didn't matter as much as the authority she'd be allowed to operate with.

Plus, on Bajor, the space-faring military may have traditionally been a part of their ground army rather than the navy or the air force. After all, here on Earth, armies operate helicopters and transport planes; the Bajorans might have seen their first few space faring vessels to just be an extension of vehicles like that.

While Kira may have been a low-level operative in the Resistance, her rank may have been indicative of her leadership skills and her operational skills. It easily could have been that she focused mostly on leading troops into special operations missions rather than larger battles. 

Due to this special operations experience, it could be that the Provisional Government felt it necessary to skew her rank higher. The US Army's Delta Force tends to mostly recruit officers at the rank of captain or major for example, and enlisted men tend to have been recruited between the ranks of E4 and E8. Depending on what Bajor's military tradition looks like, they could have given her the rank of major for similar reasons.

As for why she was never a lieutenant colonel, I think the reason is that there isn't a rank of lieutenant colonel in the Bajoran Militia. While the roles of each rank in the Militia will resemble those in Earth's armies, it's not always a 1:1 thing. The authority of any given rank could be at least partially based on how long they've held it.

There was no explicit reason given for this, but it's implied there isn't a lieutenant colonel rank. There hadn't been any lieutenant colonels shown on the show prior to this, so the rank wasn't an established part of the Bajoran Militia's chain of command. 

When Kira is shown in a Starfleet uniform towards the end of season seven, she's wearing a commander's rank insignia, so I think it's safe to assume it's a direct promotion, though. That'd make sense given the chain of command we'd seen previously: Kira had been acting as Sisko's first officer for the entire show, so she'd been acting with the authority of a lieutenant commander for the most part."

DaystromInstitute,fe0032a,t3_engchw,1578799854.0,"I think the multi-vector assault mode is one of those things that looks cool on screen, but it'd be difficult to implement fully into a fleet initially. Because nobody would know how to fly around a ship like that initially, there'd be times when a lot of friendly ships would accidentally crash into a *Prometheus* class during the first few battles.

Plus the initial stages of an engagement seemed to involve a lot of tight formations. I'm not convinced that there'd be enough space for the *Prometheus* to properly utilise its multi-vector assault mode without crashing. This is possibly one of the reasons why none of the *Galaxy*-class ships separate either: it'd be too difficult to do that in a tight fleet formation.

Because of that, I think that if the *Prometheus*-class did see any combat use during the Dominion War, it probably would have mostly been missions where it was just a *Prometheus* and maybe two or three other ships running smaller operations or more covert operations."

But this would have been noticed by Gosden's parents fairly quickly because they'd have noticed him on the phone to a friend either because they saw him on the phone a few nights before he went missing or because they'd call each other back and forth and some of the calls would show up on their phone bill."

If a friend from the summer camp *was* involved somehow in his disappearance, they'd almost certainly have had to organise the meetup via Andrew's home phone or by a nearby payphone (if there was one available; they were on their way out by 2007). 

In either case, it's a lead that probably would have been investigated, or at least partially investigated, by the police at the time because Andrew's parents would have either brought up the friend from camp or that the money it cost to use the payphone had gone missing."
