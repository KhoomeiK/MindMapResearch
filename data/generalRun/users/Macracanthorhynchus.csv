lostgeneration,ffhd502,t1_ffh3a9y,1579930498.0,"It's not hurt by the fact that Obama was called a ""socialist"" from day 1, even though he didn't really enact much (if any) socialist policy.  The word lost its power.  Now when his opponents sling it against Bernie, the minimally-attentive voters are going ""Yeah, so, like, more Obama?  That sounds cool.  Socialism was fine.""  Meanwhile, the actual socialists are like ""He's a damned good start, and once he's been in office for a while we're going to elect someone who's an EVEN BIGGER SOCIALIST"".  Ya played yourselves, Republicans.  You squandered all that McCarthyist fearmongering and you're gonna have to call Bernie ""Mister President""."
lostgeneration,ffhcpqb,t1_ffhbyn2,1579930071.0,"Exactly.  My bachelors degree focused on environmental science, but my doctorate is in a mostly non-climate focused area of biology.  My day job doesn't pay me to interpret the latest climate models, but I do run in circles with some climatologists.  There are certainly optimists like your FIL, and there are pessimists too.  Everyone agrees that we must act, and everyone agrees that without action things will be *very* bad.  The question is whether the mostly-unstudied feedback loops and lag in the greenhouse effect means that even with the best possible action we're going to have to watch some things get worse. 


Ultimately this is largely a semantic debate - Can we ""prevent catastrophe"" or must we settle by working our butts off to ""make the catastrophes we will face less catastrophic""?  What do we mean by ""catastrophe""?  With middle-of-the-road climate action, I'm optimistic I'll be able to survive, but my friends in rural Madagascar are already suffering from droughts and floods that are probably getting exacerbated by climate change.  They're going to face catastrophe if things get even a tiny bit worse, and I'm not at all optimistic about their future crop yields."
lostgeneration,ffhbhss,t1_ffhaclg,1579928861.0,"You and /u/OlduvaiMan seem to be misunderstanding what /u/FlyingSwords and I are saying:  All four of us seem to agree that Bernie should be the president and that radical environmental action is needed to improve the chances of society's survival, humanity's survival, and the survival of millions of non-human organisms.  The point we're making (or at least, that I'm trying to make) is that it's possible that ""preventing catastrophe"" *may* not be possible any more.  We simply don't know whether some amount of ""catastrophe"" is already built into our future.  I don't know how many climatologists or ecologists you talk to regularly, but mine are decidedly mixed on whether we have time left to have a future that's ""good"" as opposed to a future that's just ""less bad"".  


Just because we can't prevent *all* climate problems that doesn't mean we shouldn't be taking decisive action.  The point is that *if* we try and *if* things still keep getting worse, we shouldn't give up fighting because things would have gotten *even worse* without our actions.  I'm not a fatalist - I'm just a scientist who does his best to interpret climate models and data on ecosystem collapse and is concerned that we've missed our opportunity to achieve a scenario that doesn't meet some definitions of ""catastrophe""."
China_Flu,ffha0i1,t1_ffh46kt,1579927478.0,"The question I keep pondering in my bed at night is this:  If the Chinese realize that their economy is going to suffer due to this outbreak, will they continue to contain it, or will there come a time when they decide the only way not to fall behind is to make sure that the disease spreads to other economies so that everyone drops in roughly equal measure?"
