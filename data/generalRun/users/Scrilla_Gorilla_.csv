We appreciate your insight, and I’m happy you found a place that suits you. If I were afraid to live in the city, to stop at random intersections, I would probably move. You can call that attitude “toxic masculinity,” I guess, I mean I do actually live here. And I’m truly not afraid to drive around. There’s a lot of cool shit in Baltimore. That’s a lot of cool shit within an hour’s drive. I can hop on a train and be at Madison Square Garden in a little over two hours. I’m sure you love Texas and wherever you live had a lot to offer.

When this happens on a credit card the money reverts back to the customer automatically after a couple of days. When this happens on one of these cards it gets stuck in limbo and you need to deal with their customer support to figure it out.
