depression,fde3mji,t3_eksxke,1578330441.0,"Hey Sheila.....firstly, Belated **HAPPY BIRTHDAY**!!!

You are officially turned 25 NOW! **Congratulations** yaar!!!

We are not kids anymore :-)

But still I do understand your pain, it's really hard when our parents yell at us.

As you mentioned above, your dad is a high b.p patient, he is generally little bit higher in anger. That too not all men understand girl's problems. His day may be not good at work. We do not know the exact reason right, or may be he is also not well (mostly guys don't tell small health issues easily)

Coming to your **mother, she is playing 2 roles at a time.** mother and wife. Both are very very important to her. She knows that it's not good for your father's health if he argues much. May be that is the reason she shifted to your father side, just to cool down him. She might think that later she can convince you as she believe that you are a nice girl.

Just think, what ever they do (yell, scold, etc) they are still our parents. **As long as they exist only, we are a kid/child to someone and vice-versa.** So, don't talk quick decisions.

It's really hard when our heart broken/paining but still wait for some time and talk to them once they cool down.

If you still don't think you are okay, here we are. Here, people are there to be your side.

Last but not least, **you are NOT alone,** we are there for you for any help. Be strong and be always!!

Just a small suggestion: Why don't you write down all your sad or happy moments in a book with date? when you check after 10 or 20 years later, you will realise it was a small issue (you will be playing 2 roles at that time na).

**Life is not short but enjoy every moment.** It's a one way journey, we cannot undo here......."

If people ignore you, let them go. You can be on your own. Being alone is different from loneliness. 

By the way ....... HAPPY HAPPY NEW YEAR :-)

Always keep smile..."
ForeverAlone,fcq5j4n,t3_eih8j4,1577879180.0,"Hi, I don't know you well but I wanna say one thing. Don't worry, you just chose the wrong persons as your loved ones. You can always see good people who can be your friends for a life time. Never get disappointed yaar. Yes, parents are important and everyone's love. Still you need to make friends, not time pass friends.

Be strong okay, if nobody is replying you, it's okay, even you can ignore them and spend your free time for a good cause.

Happiness stays in you only. You need to find it my friend.

Keep smile and be happy okay.....

Last but not lest........ HAPPY NEW YEAR :-)

My wishes to your parents also. Have good food and watch nice movies."
