Spanish,ffb70jv,t3_esmjch,1579753500.0,"Think of preterite as finite and specific, and Imperfect as background, description, and habitual actions (unspecified number of times). 

Ex: We were walking in the park (on-going action in the background, so imperfect) when I fell down (preterite, 1 time action).

When I arrived home (preterite), my brother was watching TV (happening in the background).

For preterite, using the word distinct is not a good enough explanation. What they mean is a specific number of times. Ex: I went to the park 2 times this week.   or When I was ten (description, so use imperfect) my family went to Disneyland (preterite, since it's a specific number of times).

If I were you, I'd look on YouTube for some free videos on preterite vs imperfect. Sr Jordan or someone similar can explain it more easily on video.

Wages and benefits all depend on where you live.  If there is a strong Union (for example NY) there will be a good pension, good insurance, stronger protections.  I did not witness this in the Midwest, nor in the South (via my own experience and via friends and the news).  The stress and hoops teachers have to jump through are starting to outweigh the wonderful teaching moments with the kids (which is my favorite part of the job).

Before you decide anything, job shadow a person (or more) in your desired field for at least a day.  Pick their brain as much as possible. Find out what you're getting into.  You'll know if you love it.
