Don’t expose your baby to unnecessary anesthesia, pain meds, etc. Sorry this sounds snarky, but you putting off this surgery until after the baby comes is just one of the many sacrifices parenthood will require. If you do it after the baby comes, you will need need help because you will be in crutches and will be unable to carry the baby. Good luck to you and your baby!"

AskReddit,fcktmlm,t1_fcjs9ib,1577732925.0,"I’ve had this. Something was off after my daughter was delivered. Find out my heart rate was in the 40s, I had/was hemorrhaging and the medical staff came back in after my husband went and got a nurse. They gave me a drug to stop the bleeding and I went into shock/anaphylaxis from it and said “I feel like I’m gonna die...” Of course, everyone in the room said”oh, no you’re not!!” But I didn’t believe them. IV Benedryl stopped the symptoms. I now have “Allergic to Robinul” all over my medical history."
