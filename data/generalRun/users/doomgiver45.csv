worldnews,ff4vesl,t3_erfcm7,1579573369.0,"Of course not. I just watched both of my parents work themselves grey doing jobs that require degrees. They both worked/continue to work harder than anyone I know, and are only now beginning to be able to save any money from it. I don't exactly know what to do in life, but I know that plugging my way through the same ""safe"" job my whole life is a great way for it to stay exactly the same level of mediocre. We're meant for something better, in a world that says none of us are valuable enough to be able to live with dignity."

todayilearned,feip60h,t3_ep8uzq,1579143771.0,"Abrahamic religions do contain periods of inactivity where God appears to take a hands-off approach to humanity. In the bible, for instance, God was silent for 400 years before Jesus was born. Starting from an assumption that there is a god, Deism is a logical direction to take if he hasn't spoken to anyone in a verifiable way in much longer than 400 years, as is the case at this point."

funny,fe5ogzr,t1_fe5jxlz,1578872173.0,"Yeah I hate that shit. All I want is a nice, quiet drink at a bar that smells like smoke and stale peanuts. Now all the bars in my area are overrun by loud assholes who fight and draw police attention."
todayilearned,fdpmb0g,t1_fdnctrb,1578632659.0,"I like the Mark Greaney ones, but the ghost writers after him appear to just be following some kind of formula. The Clancyverse books are all kinda bland now. I really like the show though. Krasinski is absolutley killing it as Ryan. My only gripe so far is the lazy writing for Cathy NotRyanYet."
todayilearned,fdpk1i8,t1_fdoyh49,1578630754.0,"Same thing happened with Family guy. Peter used to be able to at least attempt to verbally cross swords with people/family that pissed him off. It was part of the reason why the early seasons were so damn funny. Now he just beats the crap out of anyone who disagrees with him. I think writing for shows like this is just too difficult in the long run, and writers eventually resort to simplifying the main character's personality to make it easier to write for."
worldnews,fdpjh6x,t1_fdoj8u0,1578630298.0,"Yeah I didn't think it was a coincidence that a plane went down so soon after the attack. I even kinda guessed that Iran had something to do with it, but it didn't occur to me that it might have been an accident. That makes a lot more sense than ""Iran blew up a passenger jet just for the hell of it."""

AskReddit,fcalt5p,t1_fcaj2ur,1577571785.0,"I heard it had something to do with changing their focus from drunk driving to drinking in general. They did a really good thing getting states to toughen their DUI laws, but now it seems like the org is run by a bunch of lunatics who want a second prohibition. Drunk driving is one thing, but if I'm being safe, stay the fuck away from my whiskey."
worldnews,fcabnu4,t3_eggsbg,1577566264.0,"Nobody important seems to care, and nobody will do anything. Republican senators are benefiting personally from a corrupt president, and if he actually did shoot somebody on 5th avenue, there'd be a massive propaganda campaign bombarding us with the idea that the guy who got shot was clearly a corrupt socialist puppy killer liar hoaxmaster and probably deserved it or something national security."
news,fcaabp0,t1_fc7hx84,1577565561.0,"USPS is absolutely abysmal where I live. If you mark ""hold for pickup"" on packages, they straight-up ignore it and deliver it to you anyway. When you complain, the pig-faced, dead-eyed, unfirable piece of shit behind the counter says ""wasn't my shift, and I don't know who delivered it."" Zero fucks. Even when it's more expensive, I'd rather use anyone other than USPS. They can go to hell."

StarWars,fc2dtde,t1_fc2citv,1577354377.0,"He looks jarringly different because in the 30ish years between those two roles, he did very little live-action acting. He did cameos occasionally, but most of his career is voice acting. Voice actors being famous wasn't really a thing until recently, so nobody bothered to take any pictures of him."
