dndnext,felvsb6,t3_epm10e,1579232171.0,"I wanted to write a more thorough response to this since I tend to run dark campaigns, but allow and encourage silliness, within limits.

So here is a quick and not entirely thorough discussion of how your way works, and how it misses some major methods to keep ""on-topic"".

1. Dark humor is still humor: It can lift the mood temporarily for the party while dealing with extremely dark content. You should use this.
2. IC vs OOC discussion: OOC something might be funny because of the way I describe something. Or because what I planned to be a massively dark scene randomly ends in a pratfall by the boss. Run with it, and then re-establish why shit is dark. OOC let your players have fun! They are not subject to 4-6 hours of endless darkness, they get to have fun. Part of that fun is laughing off the tension, and it's a good sign the dark parts are going well. Just give them their five minutes, now is a great time to call for a 5-10 minute break.
3. Planning via Flashback: The way I handle this is not by doing flashbacks, but by making it pretty clear that not properly planning is dangerous. They usually receive maps and intelligence of questionable quality. They then make their plan, together, outside of my presence with the ability to ask me rules clarifications at any time. They then run the heist/etc. At the beginning each of them receives a crazy powerful, one-time-use ability tied to their expertise. No rolls, no bullshit, auto-win buttons to handle when shit hits the fan. These do not mean they will pull off the heist if the plan is terrible, but it allows them to fix sudden twists (of which there will be a few provided by me or by the dice). It lets the players realize that they are badasses, but also that they are not immortal or able to get away with making bad decisions. Each failure comes at a cost, you either fix it or try to use your 1/forever ability to fix it. Players will be extremely careful with these abilities, and generally will try to avoid using them at all.
4. Narrating failure: one of the other commentators mentioned that you can portray this as just bad luck, and I would strongly encourage that.
5. Seriously consider adopting the Take 10 Optional Rule. It allows players to be badasses when they aren't in a hurry.... when they are in a hurry everything can go wrong. Those situations /should/ be stressful, so make them stressful."
