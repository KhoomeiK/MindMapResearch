We could use another consistent 3 and D guy and maybe another really good 3 point sniper. Ben McLemore has been a pleasant surprise. Hartenstein seems to thrive when given minutes. Capela has been solid and tossing up occasional 20/20 games. 

Westbrook needs to just drive and shoot midrange. I’m fine with 3 3s a game and he’s actually been decent about that lately. 


Austin Rivers is a luxury and I hated the dude a few years ago. House started the year great but has disappeared. I’m so happy EG is back. We need him healthy.

The running is that part that I’m most impressed with honestly as it shows his effort and will to improve the most. I don’t know how many people really paid attention to his early career but he didn’t get many minutes just because he had no stamina to speak of. Now he sprints down court every time for long stretches."

I had bad luck with roommates. I spent a semester overseas in college and when I came back there was a mix up in housing so I got stuck with some random guy, instead of one of my friends, in the on-campus apartments. The guy was a total ass. Normally I don't make fun of people for their weight, but since it plays a part in the story I need to inform you that he was probably 5'8"" and 450+ lbs. - the sort of guy who if he were walking across the street and you swerved to miss him, you'd run out of gas. Big fella'. Well, we actually shared a bedroom, which wouldn't have been that big of a deal since I found myself staying with my girlfriend most of the time, but it did lead to one very awkward, disturbing, and scarring moment.


One day I came home early from class. I opened the door to the bedroom to put my shit up and work on a paper that was due later that week. I was not prepared for what I walked in on. On his bed, was my roommate. He was hooked up to some sort of suction tube contraption that vaguely resembled the thing in The Matrix they used to get the bug out of Neo, except instead of ending at the navel it ended a bit further south. It sounded like a jet taking off. He was naked. And shiny. I don't know if it was oil, sweat, or both. On the TV was some Japanese porn. When he saw me open the door, his eyes got wide, although I'm not sure if it was from the shock of me walking in on this whole scene of the timing of my entrance into the room, for at that moment he let out a bellow that would make any male elephant seal run in terror, forsaking his harem forever. I closed the door, walked out of the apartment and didn't come back for a week. We never spoke of the incident. The bad part is that I think he HAD to use that device because I honestly don't think he could reach himself otherwise, due to his girth. I don't even know that he fit in the shower very well since it was just a small stall type shower. I don't know that he could ever get too clean down there, which may be why he always had that slight sour odor surrounding him, like some bizarre mixture of dried jizz and apricots.


The whole scene probably only lasted about 5-10 seconds, but it is forever imprinted on my brain. No amount of drinking that week erased it and I fear nothing ever will."

trashy,fcm6x58,t3_ehx3yg,1577765811.0,"Reminds me of my second worst roommate. 


During my last year of college, when three friends and I rented a house together, thinking it would be great. However, one friend bailed and moved back East at the last moment. He did, however, find a replacement, which was nice. Or so we thought. Her name was Heather, and she was the devil incarnate. She'd hoard dishes in her room, usually cereal bowls with an inch of milk in the bottom, stacked up 4-8 bowls tall and stuck together with the milk-gone-bad. Every time rent or any other bill was due she'd go to Santa Barbara for a week. It sucked 


However, all of that paled in comparison to one particular offense. Heather and I shared a bathroom, which wasn't a big deal most of the time. However, one morning after waking up at 6:00AM to study a bit more for an 8:00AM genetics exam I went to take a shower, eyes still partially matted shut with sleep. I stuck my head under the water, trying to wake up a bit, giving it a nice soaking, and then reached over blindly for my shampoo bottle, which was on the window sill. I felt something damp and spongy at the base of my shampoo bottle, but ignored it for the moment, and continued with the hair washing ritual. Upon rinsing the shampoo out of my hair, eyes finally opening a bit, I glanced down to where I felt the strange object, and what do I see? A tampon. Used. On what appeared to be a heavy flow day. A thin trail of diluted uterine lining and blood trickled down the wall, onto the soap tray. I lost it. I grabbed the tampon by the string, marched into her room where she lay sleeping, and threw the vile object at her, barely missing and instead sticking to the wall next to her head. ""Do you mind not leaving your fucking tampons in the fucking window of the shower we happen to share, you inconsiderate cunt."" I left, knocking over the leaning tower of cereal bowls on my way out. I went downstairs to the other bathroom to finish my shower. 


Two months later, the same fucking thing happened again. I shit you not. We kicked her out the next day and got a new roommate the following week."

nba,fdzc3qm,t3_enfm28,1578788676.0,"We are wildly inconsistent on defense other than PJ Tucker who hopefully isnâ€™t hurt too badly. We could use another consistent 3 and D guy and maybe another really good 3 point sniper. Ben McLemore has been a pleasant surprise. Hartenstein seems to thrive when given minutes. Capela has been solid and tossing up occasional 20/20 games. 

Westbrook needs to just drive and shoot midrange. Iâ€™m fine with 3 3s a game and heâ€™s actually been decent about that lately. 


Austin Rivers is a luxury and I hated the dude a few years ago. House started the year great but has disappeared. Iâ€™m so happy EG is back. We need him healthy. 


Oh yeah, Harden is good at basketball.

The running is that part that Iâ€™m most impressed with honestly as it shows his effort and will to improve the most.

I had bad luck with roommates. I spent a semester overseas in college and when I came back there was a mix up in housing so I got stuck with some random guy, instead of one of my friends, in the on-campus apartments. The guy was a total ass. Normally I don't make fun of people for their weight, but since it plays a part in the story I need to inform you that he was probably 5'8"" and 450+ lbs. - the sort of guy who if he were walking across the street and you swerved to miss him, you'd run out of gas. Big fella'. Well, we actually shared a bedroom, which wouldn't have been that big of a deal since I found myself staying with my girlfriend most of the time, but it did lead to one very awkward, disturbing, and scarring moment.


One day I came home early from class. I opened the door to the bedroom to put my shit up and work on a paper that was due later that week. I was not prepared for what I walked in on. On his bed, was my roommate. He was hooked up to some sort of suction tube contraption that vaguely resembled the thing in The Matrix they used to get the bug out of Neo, except instead of ending at the navel it ended a bit further south. It sounded like a jet taking off. He was naked. And shiny. I don't know if it was oil, sweat, or both. On the TV was some Japanese porn. When he saw me open the door, his eyes got wide, although I'm not sure if it was from the shock of me walking in on this whole scene of the timing of my entrance into the room, for at that moment he let out a bellow that would make any male elephant seal run in terror, forsaking his harem forever. I closed the door, walked out of the apartment and didn't come back for a week. We never spoke of the incident. The bad part is that I think he HAD to use that device because I honestly don't think he could reach himself otherwise, due to his girth. I don't even know that he fit in the shower very well since it was just a small stall type shower. I don't know that he could ever get too clean down there, which may be why he always had that slight sour odor surrounding him, like some bizarre mixture of dried jizz and apricots.


The whole scene probably only lasted about 5-10 seconds, but it is forever imprinted on my brain. No amount of drinking that week erased it and I fear nothing ever will."

trashy,fcm6x58,t3_ehx3yg,1577765811.0,"Reminds me of my second worst roommate. 


During my last year of college, when three friends and I rented a house together, thinking it would be great. However, one friend bailed and moved back East at the last moment. He did, however, find a replacement, which was nice. Or so we thought. Her name was Heather, and she was the devil incarnate. She'd hoard dishes in her room, usually cereal bowls with an inch of milk in the bottom, stacked up 4-8 bowls tall and stuck together with the milk-gone-bad. Every time rent or any other bill was due she'd go to Santa Barbara for a week. It sucked 


However, all of that paled in comparison to one particular offense. Heather and I shared a bathroom, which wasn't a big deal most of the time. However, one morning after waking up at 6:00AM to study a bit more for an 8:00AM genetics exam I went to take a shower, eyes still partially matted shut with sleep. I stuck my head under the water, trying to wake up a bit, giving it a nice soaking, and then reached over blindly for my shampoo bottle, which was on the window sill. I felt something damp and spongy at the base of my shampoo bottle, but ignored it for the moment, and continued with the hair washing ritual. Upon rinsing the shampoo out of my hair, eyes finally opening a bit, I glanced down to where I felt the strange object, and what do I see? A tampon. Used. On what appeared to be a heavy flow day. A thin trail of diluted uterine lining and blood trickled down the wall, onto the soap tray. I lost it. I grabbed the tampon by the string, marched into her room where she lay sleeping, and threw the vile object at her, barely missing and instead sticking to the wall next to her head. ""Do you mind not leaving your fucking tampons in the fucking window of the shower we happen to share, you inconsiderate cunt."" I left, knocking over the leaning tower of cereal bowls on my way out. I went downstairs to the other bathroom to finish my shower. 


Two months later, the same fucking thing happened again. I shit you not. We kicked her out the next day and got a new roommate the following week."
