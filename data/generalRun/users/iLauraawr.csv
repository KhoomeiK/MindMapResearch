 Just 10 minutes down the road however is Tullamore, a much larger turn. Here you can do the Tullamore DEW distillery tour. There is a tour in the old bonded warehouse, but you can then pay extra to extend the tour out to the current distillery.

One thing to note, drink driving is not tolerated well in Ireland with strict laws that will see you taken off the road. So if you are doing lots of distillery tours, take into account how much you drink while there, and maybe have something to eat afterwards."

I signed up for the VHI Mini Marathon in Dublin at the end of May, so that's currently my goal.

Work are running an Operation Transformation program, so the first weigh in was today. Looking forward to seeing how the 7 weeks go."
