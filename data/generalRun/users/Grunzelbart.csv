If you believe all politicians to be egoistical and 'evil' or w/e this is absolutely true though. But I don't believe that. I think a lot of them can be well-meaning or hold good positions.

You can look into it more here: https://timeforchange.org/are-cows-cause-of-global-warming-meat-methane-co2

(i don't like sourcing specific papers because no one reads that shit anyway :D) You can totally make the argument that a human will produce more emissions sure. But touching human life is waay too unethical for me, and the whole vegan issue definitely pushes into a more moral good direction, IMO, yes. I don't think this is neccessarily a liberal vs conservative thing. That just makes this whole ordeal a bit more sucky. It's just that reducing meat consumption could be one of the best changes to make, in regards to climate-friendly impact with relatively few sacrifices. 

Sure. So I looked through a Transcript of that speech. Quote: ""Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, ..."" etc. Not quite what you said before (no prob.) and a statement that matches with what I understand of this topic. The AOC quote too, right, I've read complaints about this before. We are seeing  ecosystems collapsing. Coral reefs are dying because the oceans are getting fucked, Greendland is melting like crazy, Amazonas and Australia were facing massive burning catastrohpes in the past 5 months alone. We know what is causing these problems and we know that the warming is still on a growing uptrend, I'm sure you'd agree to this, no?

I often feel like it's less what the ""advocates"" are spouting (though that can be bullshit too, ofc. The Obama quote looks like total panic-pushing), but more so how their words and views can get twisted. Actually a big reason why I like Greta. She doen't come off as pretending to understand every issue, but usually positions herself to just pointing toward the actual Experts. Which I fully agree with. I don't really want or need to defend her or any other politicans, when I can just have a perfectly fact based discussion about the Science, without any advocating Bs too it, right?"

I'm actually pretty sure that it's more cows burping, but they absolute produce a respectable amount of methane, which is a GHG that does influence the atmosphere to a degree. 

Also you're making the same mistake again. What do Obama or Greta have to with this. I didn't bring them up. I specifically advise against listening to journalists or politicians on this issue. Greta too on that note though, so I'll humor it. I've had a pretty good impression of her so far, would you mind sourcing those statements, where she claims such outrageous things?

Further, that is really not how the scientific method works. 'science is a liar sometimes', is a really bad argument. Peer-review exists for this reason. Our whole world and understanding of it are built upon these principles, that are all interconnected and sourced upon each other. I'm sure that knowledge or tools you use in your job, are based upon scientific research that climate scientists, among others, also lean upon.

And I'd like you to show some fact about the medieval warm period. Because this is a common myth that I've seen debunked many times. (Main point: it's warmer today than at any point during the past 10k years, romand and medieval and whatever included)."

I get that it's hard to argue though. Building a proper argument is really really difficult. Trying to convince a potentially biased or conspiratorial naysayer even more so. That doesn't mean the science is bad though. Maybe more so your understanding of it, no offense - I can relate."
therewasanattempt,ff2yxgf,t1_ff2ydpp,1579529053.0,"Hey. Answer: you have to consider the timeframe at which this happened. The sun's activity has been going up over millions of years. So the climate sensitivy of the planet (aka how much something like co2 concentration can influence its climate) has gone up as well.

Also just cause the earth wasn't a ""fireball"" doesn't mean it was habitable or that the changes, when compared to our current earth, wouldn't fuck over a majority of all humans, should our levels change to something similar. For instance the earth was a lot warmer during the time of the dinosaurs, but major parts of continents were flooded then and you had coral reefs where the polar caps are today, etc."

patientgamers,feuqlb8,t1_feunxtv,1579389015.0,"Sure! You can find more info on /r/PokemonROMhacks. Just check for the Generation and Edition, you'll find Guides there. 

Some personal Reccomendations: Check for Drayano Hacks - Basically the same stock game, but you any Mon is avaliable and most of the Fights are rebalanced - Not in a Way that is super grindy, just more challenging and tactical. 

Pokemon Rocket Edition - It's sadly unfinished (yet, final update seems in the works), but you play a Rocket Grunt, trying to do proper mob stuff, in the first Gen. And then some kid comes along as in absolute Nightmare. The catch? Your starter is a Ratticate or a Zubat. You can't actually Catch pokemon, but have to beat other trainers and take theirs. 

Pokemon Red Adventure - Retells the story of the Pokemon Manga, set in the First Gen.I think this one is a tad controversial, but I dig it so much. It's incredibely technically advanced, Completely new world, great UI overhaul, improved Scripting that even allows things like Side Quest. It's a bit of a different Take on the classic Pokemon Journey, but if you never wanted to read the Manga, this might be your way in.

Also there's a Crystal Hack that lets you Free Roam, aka start beating the Gyms in any order you like."
patientgamers,fetoi88,t1_fetb777,1579377632.0,"Also there are some sick Romhacks which I always like to advertise. If you're chasing that Nostalgia high, but don't want to deal with slow, baby-easy pokemon? This is the way to go."
