Whatisthis,feklfrg,t1_fekkjmc,1579202496.0,"True story, someone once broke into my car (but didn't steal anything?) and left a barely smoked joint behind (I imagine it fell out of their pocket). I too decided it would not be wise to consume lol."
FridgeDetective,fekikpn,t3_epm5es,1579200791.0,"Married and straight in their thirties with a 3/4 year old, flexitarian (you don't eat a lot of meat, but you're not veggie either); and while a lot of your products typically would make me think California, there's other ones that have me leaning towards Massachusetts or the suburbs of New York.

You eat mindfully, leaning healthier when you're able. Eat at home 89% of the time, but do enjoy eating out on occasion. Middle class and maintain a budget, but it's a flexible one with room for splurging every once in a while.

You lean left politically, you recycle, and you're environmentally conscious but don't go above and beyond (you're not composting but you do try not to make too much waste or litter etc).

Neither you or your partner are religious, but you're not atheist either. You have parents that live close-ish, and maybe a sibling that also has kids. Also someone makes smoothies, maybe for breakfast.

I can't get a real feel for your location! I do think it's somewhere that gets snow, though. 

This was my first fridge detective work and I went way overboard lol. I'd love to know how off the mark I was."

PieceOfShitBookClub,fdodhrd,t3_emcpya,1578603143.0,Um....op did you actually read this book? Because I did and your description doesn't fit at all. The Wikipedia page (that you linked) also verifies that your interpretation is grossly off the mark.
LilGrabbies,fdnkljk,t1_fdljca9,1578587763.0,Omg she is so cute I love her! I didn't know they could have tails like that.
AccidentalRenaissance,fdhhh7k,t3_el7a6k,1578422740.0,Are you drinking wine with a straw? Is this common in some places or were you just doing it so you wouldn't have to tilt your head during the haircut?
wholesomememes,fcyjj9b,t1_fcy7smv,1578081124.0,"It could be that it was not the right weight for you, or it could be that you're just not a weighted blanket person! I'm obsessed with weighted blankets (I own...too many lol) but my brother in law borrowed one and HATED it. He said it made him feel confined."
wholesomememes,fcyjc2v,t1_fcy2ju6,1578081017.0,It's super pricey but the Bearaby weighted blanket is the only one I've encountered that gives nice weight and I swear it's actually cooling. I think I have the 20 pound one.... They say it's supposed to be 10% of your body weight but I like mine to be extra heavy.
wholesomememes,fcyj0ud,t3_ejglma,1578080874.0,I have tried approximately five different higher end weighted blankets and if you've got money to spare then Bearaby is where it's at. I seriously tell everybody about it nobody in my real life wants to listen anymore lol.
