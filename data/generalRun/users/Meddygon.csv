TalesFromTheCustomer,fffzffv,t1_fffyw54,1579895150.0,I've talked to my dentist before about the toothpaste issue - there's good news. Toothpaste isn't necessary - it's the action of moving the bristles along your teeth and gums that does the majority of the work. Toothpaste adds very little to it. Chewing sugar-free gum has similar effects (but doesn't help with between the teeth or with gums).

So many people think I just don't like mint, and let me tell you, I fucking miss thin mints. This allergy developed over time, started showing up in my late teens. I had time to enjoy mint."

CatAdvice,fev803a,t3_eqo2rz,1579394285.0,"Sitting in the room but not directly interacting with her is a great tactic to get her used to your presence. When I first god Georgie, he was 5 years old and twice-abandoned, had been to several foster houses already, so he was a nervous boy.

I would just lay on the floor with him and sing to him. And now, 4 years later, whenever I sing the song I would sing to him early on, he just turns on the motor.

husky,fel17kq,t1_fel0zew,1579211854.0,">start out slow with a soft brush and work your way up to a furminator or “rake” style brush.  But there’s no way to avoid the fur invasion.

Having previously had a Shiba, I am aware of the fur. It's it's inescapable. He would be okay with the groomers, but I could never get him to let me brush him. I'm going to have to work on this with Nala. Shibas also have that stubborn streak. I look forward to squishing her face and reciprocating her love."

She's currently with two other doggos with the foster family, but she doesn't seem to respect their boundaries as much as she respected the new cats.

husky,fekop9y,t1_feko87i,1579204442.0,"I probably should have mentioned in the original comment that I had a Shiba Inu previously for 12 years (he crossed the rainbow bridge at 16-18years old, we never knew his true age). I'm used to the vocal range and the challenging of authority that these kinds of dogs exhibit. We've got a closed off part of the yard that has chicken wire at the base of the wooden fence (which I believe actually goes a bit of the way into the dirt) so digging is not an issue to us. The whole yard is big enough that we have a specific ""dog yard"" that is bigger than the whole plot of land my old house used to be on."

husky,fekl08k,t3_epo03y,1579202240.0,"I have the opportunity to adopt the husky pictured above, named Nala. We are waiting on the final decision from the foster parent at this time. She is 1 year old and was surrendered by her original humans because she had ""too much energy"" and also knocked down their toddler a lot. Turns out she was nearly blind from cataracts, so she really just couldn't see where she was going when she expended that energy. She has since had surgery and is going to require eye drops for the rest of her life, but we are okay with that.  We also have three cats, which Nala has met and seemed to actually respect when they wanted to be alone. I should know by Sunday if Nala will be my newest family member.

Please tell me stories about what I'm in for - all the good, the bad, whatever. I can't wait to squish her face again!

&#x200B;

EDIT/UPDATE: The delay in knowing if I'd get Nala was because the foster was trying to see how well Nala would do around cats without the foster around. Turns out, Nala is extremely aggressive to anything smaller than her. Nala will not be joining my family. I'm in the process of looking at other doggos now."

HVAC,fdgvipp,t1_fdgvdhl,1578409367.0,"Understood.

Commercial locations tend to replace multiple old units (sometimes all) at a time in order to save on costs. In the event that a unit has completely failed, they may use some temporary fixes like the one shown in order to prevent having to replace that one unit prematurely when they've got a mass install scheduled.

I've had cheap customers that planned roof sweeps for a small number of units and decide ""well the one that was the REAL problem works now, and the others aren't TOO bad"" so they keep running the cobbled-together system instead of doing something, you know, efficient. Penny wise, pound foolish."
catcare,fdgu7vh,t3_elapsx,1578408442.0,"Do you leave food out and let your cat eat as much as they want? Some cats will eat until they puke because they feel insecurity about food and assume that if they don't eat everything available, they may starve. 

When I had this issue with a cat, we switched to a feeder on a timer, so she would only get small amounts at a time. She'd eat everything available, but by the time the next amount of food was available, she had time to digest.
