So you don't need to carry a tent and don't have to carry huge amounts of food and water. It makes thru-hikes really accessible compared to America/Canada. Though depending on what you want to experience, that can be a downside. You'll definitely see more people and you're never very far away (relatively speaking) from civilization.

Op's particular hut (Faulhorn) is more of a hotel than other huts and is very accessible if you're decently fit. There's a train that you can take to Schynige Platte  (@2,000 meters elevation) and from there it's a 10km+800m elevation gain hike.
