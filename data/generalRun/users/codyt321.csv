I mean what else are we even doing here?"
MURICA,feo9nfa,t1_feo1j3e,1579297036.0,Not saying that you don't vote I'm saying voting is the bare minimum. And that because you have specific issues with how money is currently spent isn't a good argument against the tax in general.
MURICA,fenrbak,t1_fenj1el,1579289686.0,"Isn't that the whole reason for elections? You don't like how someone is handling something, vote for someone else. Or run yourself, or find someone that you believe will do a good job and work for them.

Our system hinges on participation. Nothing is ever as good as it can be, if you see something wrong with a program you agree should exist then advocate for a fix that you think will help.

Where I get lost on this retort is that it's basically a cop out saying that it's impossible to improve things that are run collectively. That's just not true, we just have to tune in and turn out more often than we do."

politics,fcybet0,t1_fcy46dz,1578077641.0,"Yes, but if that opinion columnist has written a lot of pieces for them then it could be bad optics to block one of their pieces without a really good reason that you're willing to defend if it becomes public.

Especially today, I can already see ""leftist media censors conservative writer for pro-trump stance on Iran"" headline"
Conservative,fcvpnqb,t1_fcv2a8x,1578007274.0,"I understand what you're saying. 9/11 is still one of those things that I respond to on an emotional level, and it , especially as an elected representative, should be spoken about with a sense of reverence. 

But, for me, this argument just really falls flat when Trump says more objectively offensive things on a daily basis and consistently demonstrates he's willing to denigrate, in the most hurtful way, any one who criticises him. That's included veterans, the sick, and the dead. 

Like, I don't particularly like the way she phrased it either and I'm not saying you're a die hard Trump supporter or anything, but if what Omar said offends you to have an entirely negative opinion of her....what about Trump makes you (or just the vast majority of Republicans in general) feel differently?"

Real tip, and you can reach out to me personally if you need more info:

Check out sofarsounds.com

They're small, scaled down concerts held in living rooms and small shops all over the world. It's definitely an easy way to see real local culture and art, and have the best chance to talk to a stranger and make a new friend.

Full disclosure I organized the ones in Atlanta so I'm extremely biased, but I've had all my best travel experiences and have heard many many stories of people going to a Sofar Sounds show and meeting a new friend for life.


There's a bunch of videos on YouTube where you can get a basic feel of what the shows are like: https://www.youtube.com/user/Sofarsounds"

todayilearned,fby0fs8,t1_fbxwun8,1577205099.0,"We don't have to give up dignity to support small businesses. Im going to say it again, if you're offering employment it should be a job that gives someone the ability to actually live their life. You shouldn't have to have 2-3 ""part time"" jobs and public assistance to get out of poverty

In my view, businesses shouldn't be expected to cover health care costs. And all businesses should pay their fair share of taxes that go to public services like education. That would make it cheaper for businesses to hire people.  

And yes a lot of small businesses suck and pathetic labor laws shouldn't keep them in business longer than they deserve to be."
