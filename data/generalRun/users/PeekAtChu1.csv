decaf,fgokjwm,t3_eznggv,1580973538.0,For me it has been 2-3 months of <30mg/ day for the most part. I quit in the beginning of December and just recently have the drive to work out and improve myself. I only had 200ish mg/day though
CozyPlaces,fgkws2z,t1_fgkcdxk,1580875458.0,"I was thinking that too. A, lemons need lots of sunlight. B, they don’t like too much humidity. A real lemon tree would be stunted and mildewy"
jawsurgery,fgkkao7,t3_eyzusq,1580867540.0,Honestly I don’t know but I’m 28 and my teeth have moved pretty quickly. I think it depends on how healthy your gums are and how good of a job you do keeping your braces and teeth clean
shrimptank,fgi6mjw,t1_fghmiez,1580808264.0,You need to fertilize it in the substrate! Mine looked like crap as well for many months until I popped some fertilizer tabs in there
catcare,fggvzqo,t3_eya1h9,1580770798.0,"Once my cat had weird symptoms and the vet found nothing. I gave him crushed cranberry extract and still do occasionally when his symptoms flare up and it makes them go away. I think he had a bladder irritation.

It sounds like your cat certainly has a health issue. Cats don’t poop and pee outside of the litter for no reason. Slinking his tail down could mean he is in pain down there"
jawsurgery,fggv2le,t3_ey7ncu,1580770216.0,You look younger! I will have the same surgery. Can’t wait for the results
catcare,fgguxwk,t3_eye4g4,1580770133.0,"I’m not sure what to do if this behavior continues for a long time other than to consult a behaviorist or vet. But for now I think it’s fair to make the bathroom as comfy for him as possible since it’s his home turf. Also spend lots of time with him and play with him. When feeding him pet him and say his name. Feed him at meal times only, do not free feed. Give him some high spaces to be above you and close any spaces under furniture or on the floor so he cannot hide. 

If you continue to be nice to the cat, act comfortable around him when doing things like showering, don’t scare him on purpose, keep him away from young children and dogs for now, he should warm up quickly."
Guppies,fgc0tfz,t1_fgbosp6,1580667934.0,Interesting!!
rarepuppers,fgbyr0h,t1_fgax6y2,1580667336.0,"Just let us enjoy the thing!

Also I don’t like this argument. Yes you are right about wild populations, but these are captive pets. It’s like arguing you should never meet other humans because they are vectors of E. coli and influenza."
rarepuppers,fgby3wy,t1_fgbd10u,1580667177.0,Yessss I saw a white one at a pet shop in Japan! Looked like a real life Pikachu.
todayilearned,fgbts9n,t1_fgb90f6,1580666064.0,You must always smell like delicious Asian food
decaf,fg84q03,t1_fg813vu,1580609479.0,You might find that you mainly love the taste because it relates subconsciously to the excitement of drinking it? Have you tried hot water instead
dogs,fg4si1i,t1_fg20f8m,1580510135.0,"I’ve read in some dog training places that dogs are only allowed to sniff for good behavior, and the owner should dictate where the dog is allowed to sniff and pee. I was seeing what the majority of dog owners do"
LosAngeles,fg4s8md,t1_fg45dfg,1580509967.0,That’s what I was thinking!! But I’ve never met a single person who works with billboards so had no idea
dogs,fg1qeqp,t1_fg1o2d7,1580431705.0,This makes sense! 90% of the dog walkers I see in my area seem to keep walking without letting their dogs sniff. How long do your walks last usually?
