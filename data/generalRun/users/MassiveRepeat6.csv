virgin,ffg05c9,t1_ffefcvc,1579895595.0,"So yeah, the character in this story resonated with me alot more than you probably intended.

Accepting and internalizing something like the idea that people don't hate me, that's hard. That's really, really hard for me. I'm 39 years old and my experiences interacting with people have been so bad that I haven't been able to even get a single date in my life. That bothers me in a way that is hard to describe to most people, who often think it's just about sex. I've had depression over the years and fully internalized the idea that I'm not valued. I'm just another piece of shit human being that is merely tolerated and exempt from love.

I've made massive strides in the past 2 years. I was able to land a stable job and lost hundreds of pounds and transformed my body into something wonderous. Something I look at the in mirror, smile and realize for the first time in probably my life, believe that I am a handsome guy. But when it comes to people, it all goes wrong. I get into arguments when I'm trying not too. I've been terrified to approach and talk to a friend once when I realized I caught feelings for her.  Hell, I'm 'afraid' to talk to people I like and had good interactions with even here on reddit. In these cases, I don't mean 'afraid' in the sense that I'm sweating, trembling or in fear, I'm constantly worried that I will unintentionally upset them by talking at a bad time, talking too much, saying something offensive or off putting, being boring, etc and then I'll mull over how I messed up and now that person probably hates me forever.

Ok, maybe not forever. People get upset, they don't want to talk at the moment or just don't like I say. I get that, after the moment passes I'm fine. What wore me down is that you would think going through my teens and twenties I could find someone I like. And it happened, I found people who enjoyed my company and we became friends, but just friends until I event hinted at deeper feelings, then we weren't friends anymore. 

I may have a low esteem problem as so many people pointed out on this forum when I ask for advice, but it's all I've known. To someone on the outside they may see it clearly (I'm not convinced it's an esteem problem btw) but for me, it's all I've known. I don't know any other way, I simply cannot comprehend it with my knowledge and experience. 

So when you say why can't I ask someone out? If I'm being honest with myself, it's because I've never sincerely done it. My female friends I crushed on? As soon as I even hinted I liked them, no more deep conversations, hell they were reluctant to talk and eventually we never talked anymore. A girl at a party, school or in public? Rejection, every single time. I was more upfront and would actually say something like I wanted to take them out, but I honestly didn't really care. I was either upset my friends called me gay or under a mindset where I didn't care about the outcome. The last time I did it was years ago when a woman I liked straight up told me 'Ewww' when she realized I wanted to spend time with her alone.

A female friend in college that I'm almost 100% sure liked me and wanted me to make a move? Too afraid, had several painful rejections fresh in mind and didn't want to get it from someone I actually liked. So I just sort of let the connection died and school ended and I never got her number so that was that.

That brings me to a current friend I'm crushing on. I'm sure she likes me and wouldn't reject me harshly if I asked her out. I can't use the excuse of a harsh rejection anymore. I have her number (we used to work with each other) and text her from time to time and we run into each once or twice a week. So getting access to her isn't an issue. Sometimes she offers me a ride home and we have nice talk for a few minutes about our lives that I want to extend and I think that is what I'm afraid of.

I've never done this before and I'm afraid of messing up. My confidence is at a point where I'm not afraid of rejection, I'm afraid of her agreeing to a date or reciprocating feelings and then I'm in uncharted territory and being this vulnerable never ended well for me. I don't know what people do on dates,  people seem to hate most dates and think they are a chore. What if my friend thinks the same? What if I turn out not to like her much but led her on? Am I a piece of shit for doing this? Oh yeah, and didn't I have social anxiety that prevented me from getting this far before? Maybe I should just ask someone out I don't care for to 'practice' on. Well, that's probably not going to happen because my disinterest will show when I ask them and it will certainly show during the date, which won't make it good practice....and I'm sure you can see where this is headed.

Yeah, I'm a mess but I'm inspired now. Hopefully this wall of text had some structure to it and hopefully I run into my friend tonight, maintain my level of optimism and then just go for it!"

virgin,ffb7vsg,t1_ffadiyr,1579754368.0,"I agree, I don't really care about being labeled a virgin.....until it matters.

I mean, if someone wants to laugh or whatever because I'm a virgin, whatever. Have fun, I really don't care. But what do I tell a woman I like? If she laughs at me, I dodged a bullet, but I'm concerned they would get nervous or just don't wanna have anything to do with me because they wouldn't know how to handle the situation."

But yeah, no one understanding or caring is starting to get to me. It makes me feel worthless that my parents don't want to address this when I talk to them about it. Like they just can't be bothered. Or maybe I'm just a source of shame for them? I also think that they think I'm gay or into trans and to protect their own narrow sensibilities, try not to talk to me about it.

I went my whole life trying to be strong, not expressing my emotions (everyone says I'm whining when I do it now) but I'm tired of doing that. This shit hurts so much. The feeling that for whatever reason, I am incapable  and unworthy of experiencing love."

You know why I sarcastically made that last comment? Because I specifically clarified twice, TWICE I respectfully gave you my honest thoughts and how you were saying things I already addressed and how it is frustrating to have someone say something like 'I'm not trying' and completely ignoring what I said I've done for the past 25 years."
datingoverthirty,ff7awi4,t1_ff7a9e9,1579645001.0,"Cool, you either didn't read or understand what I reiterated several times and then proceeded to ignore what I already addressed. Do you see where the frustration at trying to explain something most people wouldn't understand comes from?

As an example, so many people in this topic are excited and upbeat about dating while I have terrible experiences just trying to make it happen. As a result, I don't get the same happy feelings about dating and after so long, question if it's something I should even bother trying.

So when someone tells me to go out and meet people, I have a lifetime of bad experiences doing that and I'm supposed to continue having an upbeat and positive attitude about it? I know some people do, but I don't because I'm frustrated and it gets worse with every failure."

Again, fine I just don't want to subject myself to it. 

I was also being facetious about 'the idiots' remark. I don't know them and I'm not making a judgment about their entire character from one conversation.

To be totally honest I don't find most people worth talking too. They are uninteresting, easily misled and as you can see in this very topic several times, grossly take me out of context to the point where I don't see the point in conversing with them. That's not to say that I don't want to socialize,  my attitude is a response to 20+  years of social ostracization and I don't have the same views and values as most people."
