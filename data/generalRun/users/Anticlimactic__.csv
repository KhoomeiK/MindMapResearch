WhatsWrongWithYourCat,ffhtwi7,t1_ffhpkxc,1579953681.0,"It might also be the amount of litter, since you mentioned having bigger litter boxes around, the amount of litter could be an option as to why your cat might scratch the floor and in some cases, even the litter boxes walls."
WhatsWrongWithYourCat,ffhtmpq,t1_ffht5fx,1579953291.0,"The situation I was mentioning was towards OPs cat and others, that they mentioned scratched the floor, the walls might be an entirely different situation.

Is it the litter boxes' walls or actual walls? If it's the litter boxes' walls, it's a possibility that there isn't enough litter for your cat to cover its scent with.

Also, a 20 gal box might be way too big for a cat, although they do prefer their privacy, it could possibly just be what I mentioned before."
tacos,ffhmzws,t1_ffhmy4v,1579943145.0,"Ohh, they look great.

I'm not, but perhaps I can find some. Thank you nevertheless!"
WhatsWrongWithYourCat,ffhmd0u,t1_ffhm4p2,1579942182.0,"It's a possibility, given that I've never seen a cat do that before. Unless there wasn't enough space to even dig. That sandbox seems really small for the size of the cat.

I'm not sure about actual rules, however cats aren't supposed to scratch the actual floor, in a failed attempt to bury their scent.

The reason cats bury their waste after using their box, is to mask the scent so other predators cannot locate them; although that's for wild cats, it remained as an instinct for house cats also.

Edit: Here's a [link](https://www.seniorcatwellness.com/cats-scratch-floor-after-pooping/) stating what I mentioned, let me note that there may be other reasons aside that. However given the small size of that litter box, it seems to be the issue."
