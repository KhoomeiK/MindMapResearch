When you're 18 if that's an avenue you want to go down don't let anyone tell you no. Anyways for work I'm a shift supervisor at a chain drug store. Honestly the hardest part for me is cash register, but luckily since I'm a shift I usually only do about an hour a day on cash. I'm not gonna lie, pretty much every job is going to have social interaction no way around it. Once you start working in a customer service job for a bit it will get easier. I highly suggest talking to your parents about your anxiety and any treatment they would be okay with for the time being. I can't imagine anyone who would just watch their kid suffer through this alone."

unpopularopinion,ffc724k,t1_ffc6nz6,1579793032.0,All I have is a high school diploma and I have a full-time job that's paying me 14.50 an hour which is livable. The person above your comment is right. We shouldn't support this. If nobody took this position then the companies would have to change something if they wanted to hire anyone. There are sooo many job options out there.
unpopularopinion,ffc6in5,t3_esueg9,1579792679.0,"5.60 an hour is just stupid. Find another job that pays better. If everybody stood together, didn't tip, and people found employment elsewhere, the company would learn, and you would actually have a livable wage. It shouldn't come down to tips."
