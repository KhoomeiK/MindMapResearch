TBH, I've heard that the main reason it's a gateway drug is because dealers want to push the harder, more addictive stuff that costs more since they don't make as much money on pot. Plus if it's about DUIs, I don't think that there have been a huge rash of them being the type of people that would drive under the influence of alcohol, which is legal.

Also libraries offer other things such as meeting spaces for various organizations and classes on vital skills, such as resume building and tech for seniors - and things that benefit the community at large such as health seminars. Some of the people they help are the most at risk, as they tend to often get overlooked because they make up a minority. A perfect example of this are the people who are still impacted by the digital divide, as despite it narrowing the people who are left are often the ones who still need help the most.

To be honest, it has gotten to the point where I wondered if there was something wrong with me, since I hadn't experienced the desire that others had felt with their partner.

I understand that it's a struggle to fix a car when you're broke, but some places have credit cards to deal with that specific thing.

Technically you are stealing, so I would let him know that you are going to give him X amount of money for the hamster, the cage, and what was in the cage. I'd say that you should give him $50-100, as someone like him is less likely to turn down the opportunity to get a decent chunk of change. Plus basic cages can run anywhere from $10-100+ dollars, depending on the size and quality, so it's not an unreasonable amount. Once he's taken money for the hamster, legally the critter is yours."

I'm going to give her somewhat of the benefit of the doubt since I've heard of otherwise normal people turning Bridezilla, but even so it's important for him to take stock of the relationship. If she's like this, albeit on a smaller scale, then it's not a good idea to get married at this point in time. It would be far better to seek some counseling to work out the issues, as things will only get worse over time.

To be honest, I would really recommend that you take stock of the relationship in general. It could be that she's just turned Bridezilla, but it's extremely likely that this is something that indicates her general personality as a whole. I'm not saying that you should break everything off, just saying that you should look to see if she's done similar things in the past.

## BEAT IT WITH A REAL JO-BRO - m4m

I'm a serious bro looking for a equally/more serious bro with fancy footwork. The idea is to tie our wrists together ala the ""Beat It"" video and then each JO/knife fight in a profound spiritual act of consensual hetero awesomeness. I would have done this way sooner but have little faith in humanity.  


Requirements:  
\-access to an abandoned warehouse  
\-old enough/built kinda awesome  
\-maintains good eye contact  
\-general intensity  
\-cool moves  
\-shades  
\-leather jackets ( I had to give the one in the pic back - long story, I can tell you when we finish)  
\-Bedazzler  
\-basic knowledge of knife/sword/bat fight etiquette (I can teach you what I know if you are pretty serious about art like me)  
\-can lift 80 lbs  
\-bachelor's in something or equivalent experience  
\-not a narc  


Whereas dudes/J-ing O are both undeniably awesome, I'm a straight bro. As in not gay. I just really love MJ and being open minded about new JO scenarios. We will basically play ""Beat It"" over and over again while we JO and dance, occasionally parrying/thrusting. Winner finishes the most times, but points will be awarded for finishing first/accuracy. If you're the heter-bro I'm looking for, then we can JO furiously/competitively and then just hang or whatever. I've got laser tag too. I'm pretty serious about this. As in completely serious. If you touch my junk with anything but your own I will BF you in the M. Nerds/gays need not apply. I'M NOT GAY.  


P.S. - And I've gotten with hot chicks as recently as just now.

In a situation like this there is a level of trust that when someone states that they're on birth control that they're telling the truth. Telling him that she could be lying is incredibly insulting to both of them. Also, it's extremely unlikely for the implant to fall out, as most are inserted into the arm very securely. 

I can see telling him that it's better to be doubly safe. I can even see you telling him to make sure to communicate with his girlfriend over birth control so that they're both able to make informed decisions together. However you don't tell him that she could be lying."
AmItheAsshole,ffadbsg,t3_esabza,1579732868.0,"YTA, it's generally pretty rude to smoke before you are going to be getting into a car with other people without letting them know about it beforehand. Plus when she said it was a health issue you treated her like she was making it up. That's an incredibly shitty thing to do. 

It doesn't matter if this was a real or fake health issue, always assume that if someone says that they will have a strong adverse reaction to something, that they're telling the truth. If they're telling the truth then you don't want to be responsible for sending them to the hospital."

AmItheAsshole,ffabtz6,t3_esea6l,1579731856.0,"NTA, but keep in mind that bluntness isn't always the best way to go about things. To be honest, it sounds like she was looking for a reason to leave the relationship whether she realized it or not. This new guy just happened to be the excuse. This is extremely common with people who are still with their high school sweethearts, as people change over time. I wasn't the same person at 21 that I was at 17/18. 

This was technically a passing fancy, but I think the main takeaway that she should have from this is that if you know that you're not really happy in a relationship it's important to be honest about this with yourself and with others. Don't lead others on just because you're afraid to be alone. I know that it's easier said than done, but it's important to at least be able to recognize when you're doing this."

I do think that it's important that the sister spend time with OP's kids (or at least someone's children) to make sure that she's ready for children and that this is what she wants. I think too many people have children before they're ready."

It's not unreasonable to only want to invite one part of a couple, but it's a social no-no to withhold this information until the last minute. 

However since you've stated that this is something that he seems to be blindsided by, this should be a sign to him that he should reconsider the marriage for the time being. It's not like you were some random he was inviting to a party, you were someone he cares about enough to be his BM. If his wife-to-be is going to act like this at the last minute, then what else might she do?"
AmItheAsshole,ff98pzm,t3_es6oiz,1579707433.0,"NTA. You aren't spoiled at all. You wanted to have a sweet, romantic anniversary with your boyfriend - that isn't a lot to ask at all. Actions like what happened on the date are incredibly thoughtless, as he gave no indication that he found the day to be special to him or that he sees you as important to him at all. Even if he apologizes, this still indicates that you are less important to him than him going out and drinking at his friend's house - especially as he never actually asked you if you wanted to go or communicated about this at all. And no, discussing things right before going is communication.

To be honest, I'm worried that you are steering yourself to be the bad guy in this per what you've written here, especially the spoiled remark. It makes me wonder if he's gaslighting you at all over this, trying to make you feel bad for wanting something that is completely rational and not at all unreasonable. It's not like you were asking him to take you to some exotic destination or get a tattoo of your face. It could be that you're gaslighting yourself, but either way, I have this to say:   


You are a person who is worthy of being treated well. You deserve to have dates that center around you and your boyfriend, without him trying to make an excuse to see someone else or do something that only he would really enjoy. You deserve to be with someone who communicates with you properly and respects your needs and wishes while also being attentive of how you are feeling. This would be the case regardless of gender, as these are things that every person should expect in a relationship - and this is only the beginning of the basic respect you should get in a relationship."

Your friends and the others are the ones who are completely and utterly in the wrong.

Shucks, I think that some of them also give ways on how to tell your child about budgets (ie, the ""we're poor and can't afford gourmet food"" talk) during said conversation.

Then say that she won't be getting any sort of special meal (at home) and she can eat what she's given. If she chooses not to eat, that's on her - don't force her, she will eat when she's hungry.

Agreed. I have some food allergies and I'm fine with others preparing food, but I always make sure that they're aware of my food allergies if they're going to be making containing one of my allergens. This way they can prepare my food separately (if they are willing, in the case of non-restaurant meals) or if I bring my own food, that they know so that they aren't insulted because I don't eat what they made.

Also, she should have let you know the moment she saw you cooking - not only so you could plate the hot dogs separately but also so you could cook them first. 

While I'm aware of the obvious difference between having a food allergy and being vegan, there actually isn't that much difference when it comes to food prep since food prep centers around avoiding a specific something. For vegans, it's meat. Now when it comes to my allergy I make sure to let people know about it ahead of time, as I want to make the process as easy as possible for both the cook and myself. For example, when I go to a hibachi grill I let the cook know so they can cook my food before they start cooking the shrimp/shellfish dishes.

However you're focusing on the wrong things. In your post and your statements you're basically saying that you don't want her to be fat. You pay some lipservice to health, but it comes across as your last concern.   


Here's how I would address a potentially poor diet - and I say potentially poor since we have no way of knowing how she eats on a daily basis as you've only given us an example of how she ate one time at a restaurant:   


""GF, I want to apologize for how I've come across in the past and I realize that how I was going about it was not the best way to voice concerns. While you look amazing, I'm worried about the effect that unhealthy food may be having on your long term and internal health. I understand that you have a high metabolism, but I think that it would be good for the BOTH of us to focus on healthier options and exercise more together. This wouldn't have to be a complete diet overhaul, just small things like swapping out a side of french fries for steamed vegetables, eating more raw fruit, and choosing items that have less sodium. We should also try to make sure that we drink our full eight glasses of water a day. We won't have to give up everything, just make some smaller alterations and generally healthier choices. I just want to make sure that we're both heart healthy.

I think that it also would be really nice for us to take a short walk together a couple of times a week (if possible), as that would give us some time to re-connect with each other as a couple since we could spend that time just talking to each other about our day or our hobbies - or just walk together peacefully together. I love spending time with you.""  


This takes the focus completely away from weight and places it on health. It also takes it away from her and also makes it a couple goal type of deal. Even if you're eating only rabbit food, it's still nice to make it a ""we"" deal since it sounds less accusatory and because odds are you probably have things you could improve on as well health-wise. It also makes it clear that you don't expect her to eat only rabbit food, just that you want her to make healthier choices. 

Something else to keep in mind is that her metabolism is high, which means that she likely needs a higher calorie intake - otherwise she may go dangerously underweight. If she is currently exercising, then that would make a huge difference in what she would need to take in as well on top of the metabolism needs. Also, at some point she's going to gain weight. All people generally do as they get older. She's not going to look like she does now forever, so you need to be aware that at some point she will get a bit of a tummy or maybe even get bigger. That's just what it's like, getting old. You need to just make peace with that, since by that point you won't be as svelte or in shape either."

If you were really worried about her actual health then you would have talked more about finding healthier options and exercising more, rather than focusing on ""I don't want her to get FAT like some women do, plus her eating so much is SO GROSS.""

No, you're TA because you're continuing to stay with this guy even though you know that you don't want kids and they're going to be in his life. And because this guy has shown a pretty clear disregard for not only you, but also his own children by staying out of their life and by not parenting them when they destroy your stuff and the house, as well as physically assault your cat. Even if she is not aware that she was hurting the kitty, it's bad that no one has done anything about it. 

You're also TA for sacrificing your elderly kitty, as I'm going to guess that she's done things in the past that shows that she doesn't know how to properly handle a cat. In cases like that you need to supervise and teach the child how to handle the cat. If they can't or won't properly handle the kitty, then you need to run interference.
