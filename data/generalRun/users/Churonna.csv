When you reach the top and see that there is no real respect or honour in what you're doing it all rings hollow. Some people can accept that they've been played for a sucker and go another way, some choose to live in denial and double down. 


This happens to a lot of people in the messier parts of the military. Give them a shot at real honour, to step up and really make something of themselves and they will.
