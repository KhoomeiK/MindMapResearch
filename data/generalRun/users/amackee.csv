ThanksManagement,ffdzhx3,t1_ffdr03z,1579832812.0,"Okay that checks out and I’m assuming that you requested off for that week like you requested off for the upcoming week. 

I do understand your managements perspective a bit bc unfortunately, theses days it seems like more people than ever are avoiding conflict and calling out for “full proof reasons” instead. 

Glad you’re making every effort to be a responsible teen and I hope your next employer is able to see that."
ThanksManagement,ffdqk9r,t3_ess2kb,1579826546.0,So what happened the previous Thursday?

AskHR,ffdluvf,t3_esyp82,1579823633.0,"I don’t work directly in HR, but I do work in hospitality, in management, and just wanted to highlight that sexual harassment is not a one way street. 

We just had a female manager get sacked because she was inappropriately touching the boys if they didn’t do their side work to her liking. 

The above wasn’t at my store, but I’ve had a tale of playing grab as between guys get out of control, and had to deal with the some females getting too handsy with my young males. 

You have evidence of the harassment, your gender won’t effect it. 

It sounds like you’re w/o a GM right now, so I would go up the chain to a district manager, and they will usually help nip that type of thing in the bud very quickly."
LPOTL,ff56q7t,t1_ff1w27t,1579581817.0,">isn’t quite as well researched

That’s sort of a huge understatement, don’t get me wrong, I listen to mfm and think the ladies are pretty interesting and fun but comparing Marcus to Georgia, is comparing apples to a pile of mud that someone tried to make look like an apple. 

Again, this is actually not meant in offense to mfm, but I honestly enjoy the banter more than the true crime coverage more in mfm. So they’re both good comedy podcasts and they both fill the itch of being a part of someone else’s conversation, but it would be my opinion that mfm will not scratch the true crime MEAT itch that lpotl does."

aww,feaostx,t1_feamtzp,1578950876.0,"I’m so sorry that happened to your dog. Do not even get me started on dog parks, it seems they only get worse as time goes on, after my last nightmare experience, we won’t go anymore. Thankfully, my dog had his feelings hurt more than anything. 

I would love to go to a park with a Dog Donna to bounce out the riff raff."
aww,feails2,t1_feae8ty,1578949244.0,"I think you took what I said wrong. I didn’t say it was a “bad time” anywhere, I just agreed with the parent comment that the dog was stressed and questioned if it was necessary stress.

I then expressed that some boundaries could make it a “good time” for the dog and the children. For example, the owner asking the girls to let the dog sniff and pet him one at a time. 

This wasn’t a “this is life altering abuse” comment by any means but that dog is uncomfortable, it’s not having an anxiety attack, but it is uncomfortable. 

Some people are “huggers,” and some people are made uncomfortable by hugs. Both are okay. It’s also totally okay to tell someone, “I prefer not to be hugged please.” It won’t ruin most non-huggers day if someone  who doesn’t know hugs them, but they can still set boundaries for what they like and don’t like. 

Dogs cannot set their own boundaries, my comment was just food for thought, asking: Shouldn’t someone set the boundary here?"
aww,feadie3,t1_fea8k4v,1578947327.0,"Yes it shows good training and socialization but the argument can be made that just because the dog will accept it, does that mean it should have to?

Owners should be stepping in and setting some boundaries when necessary so everyone, dog included, can have a good time."
