The are training tips and things like cadence ladders, form sprints, aero work, pedaling/quadrant drills, and isolated leg training, this does help alleviated some of the boredom. 

I make playlists for different types of TR rides and time out slower songs for the valleys of the intervals, and something hard/heavy/fast for the intervals. I struggle with comfort on the trainer and find getting off the bike for 30 seconds every 20 minutes really helps. I time that out to be in the valley of an interval so it's not really diminishing the workout. 

I agree with what others have said, 30 minute rides are not going to cut it for you goal. If you want to try TR I have a free month to give away, just PM me and email address if you are interested."

I graduated high school in the mid 1980's so thing may have changed since then.

P.E. (gym class) not only had showers, but you were required to take a shower, this was not enforced much in high school, but in jr high (grade 7-9) it was. You had to use soap, and during gym class you were required to wear a jock strap, and yes they checked that. 

It's get worse........these were not individual showers with stall doors or anything, but [something like this](https://cdn8.dissolve.com/p/D145_220_772/D145_220_772_1200.jpg). This made you easy prey for somebody with a rat tail (wet towel whip), the crazy thing is that was far from the most traumatizing thing in school.

 The time required for complete muscle glycogen resynthesis after prolonged moderate intensity exercise is generally considered to be 24 hours provided approximately 500 to 700g of carbohydrate is ingested. Muscle glycogen synthesis rate is highest during the first 2 hours after exercise.

Exactly, I have a fridge, washer, and electric dryer all from the late 1980's, plus a water cooled overclocked high end PC and my hot water heater is electric. 

My entire electric bill is at most $80 a month, the TV and PC use way more electricity than the other stuff, If I turn the PC off at night and hardly use the TV then my bill is $50 a month.

Plus the cost savings have having the same appliances for decades, and my washer and dryer and easily fixable. I fixed my washer with an $8 part, dryer needed a new timer which was $80 but that was 7 years ago so I've gotten my moneys worth out of that fix."
cycling,fbw039j,t1_fbvw3y1,1577138587.0,"I have no idea how the flight routing/prices would be from there, Bonaire is off the coast of Venezuelan and part of the ABC islands (Curacao and Aruba being the other 2), there are flights between all 3 islands so that might be an option to get there, again I have no idea on flight routing as I'm in the U.S. The island is part of Holland and very safe, but there is petty crime like everyplace is the world (don't leave valuables in a car etc).

Where to stay, [I stay here](https://www.caribinn.com/) and IMO it's the best place on the island, small and affordable. The owner has been on the island since the 1970's and is a local legend and loved by the locals. He's done a lot over the years to help the local people, his staff of local people have been there for decades. 

MTB, this year was the fist time I rented a bike while there, I'm a roadie so a MTB took getting used to but I had a great time. The wind can be brutal and there are some tough climbs, but it's a beautiful island. The locals are very friendly and I rode with a group of 6 for a few miles, judging by the strava flyby and looking at their strava there is a group that rides regularly, it's a good was to find routes to ride. Language is papiamento but almost everybody speaks English (plus Dutch and Spanish) so you'll have no problems.[ I rented a bike here](https://www.scootersbonaire.com/) had no issues with it.

Diving, the [island is an underwater park and you need to pay a park fee to dive there.](https://stinapabonaire.org/stinapa/nature-tags/) You also have to do a check out dive and learn the rules, the dive shop will talk to you about this. No gloves allowed at all (unless you have a medical waiver), no chemical light sticks, no fishing, like I said it's an underwater park. You can do 95% of the dives from shore, some people only do boat dives, others like myself only do shore diving. The diving is very easy, minimal current and you are on the leeward side so no big waves. The macro life is very healthy, what you won't see is a lot of big stuff like giant groupers or sharks, there are large tarpons there. The hotel I listed is right on the water and you can dive there right off the dock.

Compared to a lot of places the island is very affordable, plenty of grocery stores and restaurants. I rent a truck but the main part of town is a 10 minute walk so you can certainly go without a rental vehicle. 
If you do vacation there let me know and I can give you more detailed info on things like good restaurants etc.

EDIT: The Carib Inn runs 2 boats a day, 8:30 am and 1:30 pm, if you stay there and boat dive be there early as the boats like to leave at those times."
