StarWars,fgkneui,t1_fgkf43j,1580869505.0,"I mean, I liked it from the short time frame of the movie there was quite a bit packed in. Jyn starts to slowly trust k2 and he starts to trust her after she shows shes willing to die for the rebellion, the rebels show cowardice until they're shown that victory is possible against the empire, these two dont have much development but are just a nice team, I guess maybe development wasnt the best term. Maybe just well defined. The characters stay in their roles pretty well when alot of characters we see in more recent star wars media have alot of fluctuation and will do stuff that seems completely out of character or just stuff that doesnt fit the scene.

For example, there were barely any forced jokes in the middle of serious situations in this movie, alot of modern movies try to shoehorn quick comebacks or namecallings in the middle of intense fighting scenes where one would never do that, not much of that in there movie, characters were serious and stuck to their task.
