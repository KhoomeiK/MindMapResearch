RATS,fe3e897,t3_enizcf,1578848460.0,"They're all good, but the bottom rat has not only got excellent form, but added a piked half-twist. That's pro quality yawn-mlem right there."
aww,fe0nwjh,t1_fe01sfa,1578816576.0,"You have no idea. Young rats chew on each other for funsies. Adult males would seriously sit on the sofa playing Call of Duty all day if their paws were big enough to work the Xbox controllers. And watch your beer around them, they love that shit and give no fucks about who has to clean up what they spill."

They're not sized as per seeing patterns, but they don't seem to have gone along with the last wave of re-grading. My hips are between a pattern 10 and 12, but my best-fit pair of jeans is American Eagle 2."

RATS,fdi4r3f,t1_fdh2fgx,1578435715.0,If he thinks you look sick he might try to groom you all better. Rats have empathy and they snuggle ill or injured friends. Feel better soon!
RATS,fdi0o6y,t1_fdhgace,1578433637.0,"You can also give him a sedative. Valerian root is effective, and rats love it - it smells like stewed feet, so of course they want to roll in it. I use it sometimes when I need to take a skittish rat somewhere, ask the trip is less rough on the both of us."

AskReddit,fdg35a7,t3_el35pg,1578378261.0,"Whatever number gets you paid to model. Strangers stop me on the street and get me to take out my earbuds so they can tell me I'm pretty. I realize that sounds really r/thathappened, but it actually does, and it's often enough I'm not unduly surprised. Mostly it's nice, but occasionally I get some dude who thinks this should be a revelation and I should fall at his feet for letting me know.

I think I look fine, but the whole numbers thing is based on how you think other people think you look. Based on the amount of time other people spend complimenting me, and the fact that they give me money to look like me in front of a camera, I assume I'm hot."
RATS,fdg2l7e,t3_el4ja3,1578377687.0,You got stuff on you! They're helping you get it all off. They'll do the same thing to bands aids if you let them. :)

RATS,fdfz8iy,t1_fdfl3sm,1578374449.0,"Either is fine. I give it dry, so they can wear their teeth down a bit. If you give a mischief a handful of dry pasta, the little tic-tic-tic noises of many rats happily munching away on it sounds like hard rain, or tiny hail.

Edit: Comedy is giving an 8"" rat a 10"" piece of uncooked linguini. Fun for the whole family!"
relationships,fdfcsrz,t1_fddihft,1578358660.0,"This is a terrible idea. If she would reject you when asked straight out, then she'll still reject you after a bunch of poetry, only now she'll think you're a creep for tying to manipulate her out of her actual opinion. Poetry will not suddenly make you seen romantic. Your scheme will make the poetry weird and off-putting."
RATS,fdf4rqw,t1_fdei16i,1578353293.0,"Do push. I don't know if it's the same there, but many vets here will use pentabarbitol for euthanasia. It's a euphoric sedative. Humans who have come back from an overdose say you get very sleepy, and everything seems perfectly all right, and a nap sounds like the most wonderful idea your ever had. I don't like losing them, but if they have to go, an overdose of nap seems like a pretty good way."
aww,fdf3n3s,t1_fdeylhe,1578352556.0,"Nah, they chew. Rodents can gnaw through steel and cinder block if properly motivated. A delicious walnut is no problem at all."
aww,fdf3apc,t1_fdegyc8,1578352332.0,"Chewing, mostly. ""Rodent"" comes from the Latin ""rodere"", to gnaw. It's their profession _and_ their hobby!"
aww,fdf327x,t1_fdeqqnc,1578352178.0,"Oh man, don't even cook 'em. Rodents LOVE uncooked corn. Just buy some cobs, hack them into carryable chunks, and watch your little buddy's eyes light up.

I keep fancy rats as pets. I stuck a whole corn cob into a cage with four of the little boogers one thanksgiving. It was half wrasslin' match and half ecstatic food orgy."
RATS,fd5538g,t3_ejx3hf,1578174234.0,...is worth three in your shirt?
RATS,fd54zrb,t1_fd09qoq,1578174200.0,Some rats figure out that you can't hear the high pitches and learn to vocalize in ranges that you respond to. It's all part of their master plan to cute you into giving them what they want.

RATS,fct149c,t3_eigq0s,1577930162.0,"Twice the normal dose will be fine. Just skip a dose and resume as normal afterwards. He might feel a bit blurgh, I suppose, but then again that might teach him not to do that anymore. 😋"
relationships,fcsr6vd,t3_eih94w,1577923041.0,"She outright told you that _she_ has anxiety problems over this. There is nothing you can do to fix this - The problem is in her head. She is demanding that you fix her bad feelings for her. This is an unhealthy dynamic. She can either fix it for herself, or you can accept that she's not in a position to have a healthy relationship right now and break up."

RATS,fcm9r08,t1_fck6kpm,1577768085.0,"I try to comment when I see one. My own babies get sendoffs fit for pharaohs. I wrap them in something warm and soft, and make sure they have their favorite snacks. I can't go with them where they're headed, but I see no reason why they should ever be cold or hungry along the way. 

I buried one with an eye dropper of amaretto. He would always try to steal booze if not watched like a hawk. I let him have a taste right before he left, because if it made him happy, why not? And I made sure he had a little extra for the road. He's probably tipping over the angels' daquiries right now."

RATS,fcm2t25,t1_fclovyl,1577762757.0,I'm currently ratsitting for a little guy who wouldn't leave a scab alone - he got a good hefty dose of the really good drugs so he'd calm down enough to let it heal. I think it's gabapentin. Sending good thoughts (and hopes he develops some sense) to your little dude!

EmulationOnAndroid,fbw8jsj,t3_eec6ws,1577143398.0,"Works fine for things up through about DS/PSP. I haven't tested newer than that. It's a bear of very little brain, tablet-wise, but I use my (even older) Kindle for retro gaming all the time. 

Gamepad would have to be BT, but if you're into point and click adventures in DOSBox, or touch-based DS games, the touch screen works brilliantly."
