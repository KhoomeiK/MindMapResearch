gaybros,ffbvh35,t1_ffbsir6,1579784127.0,"It is totally your right to come out whenever you want to and noone should take that away from you. That being said, after 8 years aren't you sick of the shame you feel your SO brings you in regards to your family. I get that it's difficult and may be painful but you've had a loving person in your life, that is very rare compared to parents who disagree with parts of their childs lives. It is clear that family is important to you but living here in the UK and being part of the community surely shows you that real family is made. 
  
What is a real shame, I don't mean any offence at all, is that at this moment you only half love your family and your SO, keeping such secrets and being ashamed of them in turn makes it seem you have other options. Sadly, you do not and it is totally unfair to your SO most of all who has stood by your side for 8 years. You need to bite the bullet and tell them something.
  
My advice, lead with how you feel, how you've been supported and how your SO has made you happy, so happy that you have decided to share your lives together. You don't even have to talk about it being a man initially just show them first and foremost that you are happy and have found someone to share your life with. When and if questions come, from your post, just tell them that you don't want to ruin what you have with your family but that you can't stop how you feel and discussion on this can be very minimal. 
  
My personal belief would be that what you have is very rare and to spoil that by your prejudices of other peoples prejudices means you do not love your SO as much as you think and it might be worthwhile considering which is most important to you, the past or the future. 
  
Good luck my brother x"

I apologise but I don't understand what it is you are saying after that. I will say that the only one who keeps commenting about gender is you. I don't even see her as a woman in the sense that her being a women has no standing on the things she has said or presented and I have made no judgements based on any of the genders involved in the documentary until the very end where they compare the ""basic instinct"" comparison and TM which is also a topic in the psychiatric evaluation."

DontFuckWithCats,fe9l6jq,t1_fe9jfbr,1578938986.0,"Can you explain the gender issue to me? 
  
I believe criticism is weighted towards the extent of how much we saw the people interviewed. Further, the documentary focuses and gives more time to the lady as there are more personal investments considered by her, for example her feeling targeted by TM. 
  
There hasn't been as much criticism towards the biker guy, who I believe to be an aggressor in regards to the situation involving ""Jamsey"" because he doesn't appear as much and doesn't constitute to the narrative as much as the others. 
  
I'm not insulted, I'm incredibly confused as to why you believe there is a gender issue and viewed my comment as such without this being about you and your issues. The only gender issue that could be pulled is that there has been a focus on TM's mother and not the absent father and yet again that's because the documentary does not focus on that. 
   
I don't need your ""food for thought"" or your appreciation, respectfully. You have created an issue where there is none and I believe this to be an attempt at moral superiority because it doesn't appear that you have anything meaningful to add to the conversation.

DontFuckWithCats,fe9i749,t1_fe9glqa,1578937760.0,I refer to them both when needed and the lady specifically as the documentary focuses on her more and I believe her behaviour worse. My comments have nothing to do with her being a woman and I don't believe her behaviour or my criticism relates to gender at all. The first person to bring gender up as an issue within this debate is you and I think that is more telling of your view as seeing women as sensitive and vulnerable. You are the sexist my mate x

DontFuckWithCats,fe8ux8y,t1_fe8smk9,1578931165.0,"Well, thanks for your opinion my mate. 
  
You can find lots of information on how childhood abuse and neglect lead people to commit all kinds of ""crimes"" from abusing drugs to people. In the UK over 28% of criminals who have served a sentence longer than 5 months were in care, that is, were orphaned or removed from their original family due to abuse/neglect etc. 
  
If you are truly interested, read Dr Richard Bentall's books as he has a very good exploration of childhood trauma vs adult mental health, psychosis, specifically hallucinations, and how this effects adult behaviour and achievement. 
  
I'd also argue the definition of a ""criminal"" as if you are truly interested, there are tons of books on forensic psychology with all kinds of findings suggesting people may be more likely to commit crime from birth due to genetics or based on status rewards etc etc. For instance, murder is considered an incredibly damaging crime to society but yet most murders are spontaneous rather than organised, so a totally normal healthy person may murder out of the blue due to threat etc. Also, if you are interested, look into books on comparing murderers and soldiers where the behaviour is similar but the justification is very different, yet there are high correlations of history between soldiers and murderers. 
  
There is data it's just not as palatable as documentaries on Netflix. 
  
I accept your apology. X"
DontFuckWithCats,fe8rn70,t1_fe8mb30,1578929818.0,"""I think that lots of people have abusive childhoods and don't go on to kill. I think he was an adult and responsible for his own actions. Lastly, he was self promoting with ""sock puppet"" accounts so he'd have gotten his attention regardless of the ""reckless sleuths"". When I was reading this I has to ready a rope team because I had to travel as far as you did up your own arse to read it and it was a little scary.""
  
Where do you address the specific two issues I described? 
  
""Lots of people have abusive childhoods but don't go on to kill"" correct, but when you read the psychiatric evaluation you understand that he didn't have a support network, never adjusted to schools or other groups and had watched animal abuse as well as being abused. ""I think he was an adult and responsible...."" this was exactly what I referred to from the psychiatric evaluation as well as the documentary and the other comments I referred you to in that, even with all the historic abuse he was still aware of his actions and how they would affect others. 
  
Perhaps he may have got the attention without these particular internet ""sleuths"" but that does not detract from the idea that we observe them rallying and fortifying themselves as a group to ""take down evil"" when I believe the specific things that these specific people did garnered more attention globally and emotionally than anything else, evidenced by TM's leaving ""clues"" that were specific to the groups ""investigating"". 
  
Then you fall into insulting me and my writing which I originally chose to ignore. Since you started your comments you've had a confrontational attitude and I can't help but feel like you have an issue that won't be resolved. 
  
As I stated noone else in the people who have commented or messaged me have stated that they found my comment hard to read and if they did I guess they commented on the stuff they did understand. I don't know, I'm not responsible for anyone else being able to understand my ideas other than stating them and reference why I came to that conclusion, I stated the two points I thought were missing, why they were important and referenced my thoughts based on either the psychiatric evaluation or the documentary. 
  
I'd disagree with them contacting the police as stated in the interviews they maintained an assumption that the ""police wouldn't help people on facebook"" and that ""i have no jurisdiction"". This is in part why I believed them to be self focused as they made it ""their"" battle rather than being objective ""he is doing this to torment us"". 
  
If I stumbled across a video of kittens being killed and felt this was provocative to the extent that may lead to worse crimes; I would first report the video at the main source, look for authentication, then confirmation as to where this was happening as animal rights are not globally protected, then I would report the video, website and what information I have to the correct body of authorities as I am not someone who enforces the law nor am I equipped to do so. 
  
Let's be pedantic and take your comment as it is ""someone killing animals"" well I've watched documentaries about farming, slaughter and butchery, I've watched videos on the dog eating festival in Korea, I've watched documentaries about poaching all the whilst not making groups about these things as they are either currently being investigated, I think are wrong but suffer ethnocentrism or I don't believe lay people would add anything to the debate."
DontFuckWithCats,fe8l7pd,t1_fe8i4t2,1578927433.0,"Dude, you're being fairly confrontational and I don't understand why.... there have been plenty of other people who have read and understood so with all due respect you are in the minority and attacking me seems rather pointless as I have no idea who you are nor why I should care.
  
If you are truly interested, I can give you an abridged version:
   
Two points that arent explored in the documentary are: 1, the historic abuse and neglect suffered by TM, this is important to the development of his crimes as the psych evaluation describes and 2, the ""sleuths"" were reckless in the way they gave TM attention which rewarded him for his behaviour leading him to feel incentivised and organised."
DontFuckWithCats,fe8ghdx,t1_fe8egrt,1578925886.0,"To be honest with you, I think I was as concise as possible considering the amount of information there is available and how I tried to explain in terms which are easier to read. 
  
You can disagree with me as we all see things differently but I'm not responsible for your education. If you cannot understand my writing that's on you and you should take the same information I've read and write your own comment and make a better point."
DontFuckWithCats,fe8dr66,t1_fe7fxw5,1578925108.0,"I think you have missed the point of my comment, I'd point you to my other responses which detail more about TM."
DontFuckWithCats,fe8cd46,t1_fe6wp51,1578924742.0,Can you elaborate?
DontFuckWithCats,fe6tkgc,t1_fe6s9ov,1578904833.0,"That is my point exactly. I found myself talking at my TV when the mother started 'going on' because she was saying ""someone else was responsible"" and all I could think was ""yes, you, ya bitch"". That lack of self-awareness seems more like a defence mechanism considering the psychiatric evaluation shows that there were troubles from childhood caused by her. There aren't many mothers who nonchalantly explain their child left home and moved to a different city at 16 and truly Express happiness at that. 
  
Oh, as soon as she started talking I thought what a cunt (apologies). To be fair, I'm pretty biased when it comes to addiction and people who glorify or profit from it. I hate to seem like I don't care or that I'm dismissive of the cats being killed, I am not and it is often a sign of violent behaviour, but you can see that their involvement was more about them rather than the actual crime. She describes going through a break up and some difficulties outside of employment and it's very evident she was looking for a place to feel supported. Consensus is an incredibly powerful and rewarding thing. If I remember correctly, the two sleuths meet at the end and I'm sure there is some passive aggression over each others involvement and whether they would have maintained interest without one another being involved. 
  
In regards to your last sentence, that and their belligerence with the police to involve them rather than just handing over their evidence."
DontFuckWithCats,fe6ss2n,t1_fe6quqn,1578903691.0,"I think in most -social discussion- mental health is often depicted as psychosis which can be interactional but is often conflated with offending behaviours, disproportionately. Mental health is such a wide spectrum that it can be hard to evaluate, especially when it comes to crimes that are violent and sadistic.
  
The biggest variable in regards to mental health, including psychosis, and offending behaviours is self-awareness. If an individual is able to understand what they were doing and how their behaviour effects others this supersedes all mental health as it is fairly rare for someone to be episodic constantly. 
  
An individual can have serious mental health issues and episodic psychosis and still be incredibly clever and sophisticated as well as understanding. What we see in TM and his evaluation is that, although he most likely has suffered severe mental health issues in his past which left him without the tools to adequately deal with adult emotional problems, he is still able to function and understand social expectations, or lack thereof, and that's why he was responsible for his behaviour. 
  
Sadly, the legal system often conflates mental health with lack of agency against well held research. Although his historic abuse and neglect may have led to a lot of his adult problems they are not the sole reasons for his behaviour. 
  
I have seen it so many times, I've worked with vulnerable men in substance dependency, abuse and offence behaviours, typically there are long histories of impoverished mental health but they are still able to understand their actions are wrong, misplaced or unhealthy. So of course its understandable that TM displays narcissism and grandiose but does not want to relate that to his actions because it appears to minimise his agency. Which from the sadistic, controlling and elusive nature of his crimes seems to be what he gained pleasure from. 
  
I do have to say that the people involved in the documentary seem like total cunts (apologies), from the sleuths to the mother, it seems about perpetuating their lack of involvement (mother) and involvement (sleuths). 
  
TM shows lots of signs of sophisticated manipulation even with a less than great academic history with lots of educational and social deficits. I think he craved love all of his life, never found it and objectified his emotions through methods of control. He grew up with animals and was heart broken by the mistreatment of his pets so for them to become the target of his control seems understandable considering the pleasure he may have received from ""regaining control"". I imagine this, doubled with the histrionics that were rewarded from his videos, made it all the more appealing to go for the next thing he seemingly was unable to control in his life, his relationships with people."

AskReddit,fe2p87e,t3_endl16,1578841375.0,"It was a couple of years ago when I was on a night out in my city. Granted I was pretty fucked up. I was going to meet my friend who was the manager of a small ""cool"" bar. 
  
Me and 2 of my friends had been singing whilst walking up the street, we got to the bar as I was finishing my fag and there happened to be a new doorman. He says that my two friends can go in, who are girls, but waits till they've gone in to tell me that I can't as I'm too drunk. 
  
I said that we were all pretty much the same and that he was being a dick, the other doorman said to let me in as he recognised me. This doorman exploded, grabbed my hand and attempted to push me to the floor, I staggered down the street and he said to ""fuck off f****t"".
  
At this moment I was enraged and so i called my friend, the manager, and told him that the bouncer wouldn't let me in and just called me a f****t. Not one minute later my friend came bursting out of the door and asked the doorman if he liked his job and why he called me a f****t. He started muttering that he wouldn't let me in because the girls said I was following them, clear lie and that he thought I was too drunk and would cause problems.
  
My friend sacked him on the spot, which happened to be his first night, he kicked off saying that he wasn't sacked as he was hired by the owner and that the owner told him he could use his initiative and so he was staying. 
  
My friend informed him that his Dad was the owner and knows that he wouldn't say that and regardless he is the manager and wants him away from the property. At which point the other doorman steps in and tells him that he should leave as he is causing trouble. I'm just stood there smoking at this point. 
  
He then exclaims to everyone that he is the doorman (""I AM THE DOORMAN"") and he will stay until the shift is over as he is the doorman (""I AM THE DOORMAN"") and he will work his shift. 
  
My manager just simply said you can either get your belongings and leave or he'd call the police and he would be asked to leave. His response, ""I am the doorman, bring them."". 
  
My friends come outside to the smoking area and bring me a drink, the doorman kicks of saying drinks arent allowed and my friend says it is fine, at this point he won't let me walk any further into the area and just continues to stand in front of the gates not allowing anyone in, so at this point it is causing a bigger scene as this bar is the typical after party bar. 
  
The police arrive and ask what the problem is, seeing me slumped with a drink in one hand and a ciggy in the other. The manager comes out and attempts to speak but the doorman just exclaims ""I am the doorman, you need to get this faggot away"". My friend rushes in and tells them he is the manager and he made the call. 
  
He tells the police that this doorman has been terminated, refuses to leave the premise and is threatening people who approach, explains the situation, all the while I'm still there just chilling pretty much whilst some people are asking me what happened. It looked like a real shit show scene. 
  
2 minutes later the police tell him that he needs to leave as he has been asked by the manager. He starts exclaiming ""I am the doorman"" and proceeds to explain that he doesn't have to leave. The police give him one last warning and he responds with ""I am the doorman"". 
  
He is then subdued and put into the police car. I finish my cig and my manager is taking the piss out of me and seemingly pissed off at the situation so I'm feeling fairly guilty at this point. He gives me a big fish bowl and tells me he will be down soon. 
  
Found out after that this doorman had been causing problems most of the night, before 1am it's a really chilled bar with a good swank to it but this doorman had been refusing men entrance and that he was telling them ""I am the doorman"" so the girls were immediately complaining and either leaving or telling my manager who had to go allow them in. Making him redundant. 
  
Sad thing is my friends dad also owns other places as well as knowing most of the doorman staff as they belong to either one main company or are shared by the same bars and clubs he employs security for other businesses. So it's safe to say that he wasn't employed by any of them, not sure what happened to him after being driven away.

However, when we say ""do you want to get fish and chips"" it doesn't necessarily mean those exact things but what you might get at the establishment which can be endless, you can get fish patties, battered sausage, saveloy, pickled eggs, a ""cheesie"" of which there are typical sides such as chip shop curry, gravy, mushy peas, garlic sauce etc etc.

When he gave the ""monlogue"" it was so eerie because it felt like he was talking about victims and how I wasn't going to be his right now but that ""we"" deserved it. So much made little sense and yet it made sense understanding the behaviour change. It is hard with all the factors that affected those moments to really understand whether he was fucked up and chatting shit or whether I was in serious trouble. It's one if my most regrettable moments. 
  
I have been in other situations, even some where it became physically violent, but nothing compares to the surreal nature after entering his flat. 
  
By the end of the video I felt totally uneasy and stuck in the memory of my situation. Maybe that is a little self-centred, but I really think it shows how powerful the video was. It truly made me think about how situations progress so easily and how at ease we can be with certain things even knowing they are -at least- risky. I truly believe this video and the people involved to be incredibly commendable for this piece of ""warning art"". 
  
It so bitter sweet because I went on to get a degree in psychology and work with vulnerable men from all kinds of situations and sadly, my account and the videos content are not that rare. Even with this, I'd still say it is hard to weigh up those risks compared to the ""reward"" as you say ""you can never really know"" and constantly searching for an end to loneliness feels more important than analysing the risk you face along the way. Yet, I have totally experienced people ""weaponsing"" those feelings, even if it doesn't seem as dangerous as my situation, in order to please themselves at the detriment of others.

gaybros,fdnrz9o,t3_em9lit,1578591639.0,"About 8 years ago I was in London on a trip. I had been to bars and clubs with my friends but failed to hook up and as I had been talking to a guy on grindr I decided to meet him. 
  
We met in a bar and had a few drinks, had smoked a spliff outside and decided to go back to his flat. All the while had been amazing, totally charming and jokey, fairly masculine but ""gay"" interests. 
  
On the way back to his flat I asked if he wanted to split an E and stop off to get some more drinks. We dropped the E in the back of the taxi and got out near an off license near his building. 
  
From the off license we walked to his flat with us both being in good spirits and being flirty touching one another etc. We did sit on a bench for a bit whilst I rolled a spliff and talked.
  
We get to his building at at this point the E us kicking in as I can feel myself coming up, I can see he is coming up too and doesn't seem to be as experienced. I ask if he is okay and tell him we can just chill for a bit no pressure on anything happening. 
  
We get into his flat and his mood and demeanour just completely change. There are very few instances where I can describe how instant and dramatic this change was. It was like everything was sucked out of me apart from this feeling of dread and there was a little feeling in my stomach making me feel more focused.
  
He was in a different state and seemed to be rushing loads, he fell on the sofa, told me where the glasses were rather sternly and told me to pour. I did.
  
As we were sat there he started to drink and I started to feel really uncomfortable as he just seemed so different (even taking into account we had dropped). 
  
He was fairly quiet except long breaths and sighs. He then rushed with energy sits up and says to me ""I'm not gay, I hate gays"" and proceeds to look at me and slap his hand on me shoulder/back. 
   
I asked him what he meant, I'm caring and as he was Polish I thought maybe he was just not used to being ""himself"" or had opinions about the ""gay community"" as opposed to ""gays"" which are two different things.
  
He replied ""no"" and just gave me this long stare into my eyes that just gave me chills and made me uncomfortable. This was not the guy I had spent the evening with at all. 
  
He sits back, explains that I am ""good"" as I'm a big guy (6ft2 and a beast back then) and whatever ""faggot pill"" I have given him has chilled him out and left him unable to ""punch"".
  
As uncomfortable as I was I was very reckless in those days and seemingly tolerant to drugs giving me this weird mix of confident anxiety. 
  
I asked him what he meant and did he mean to say the word ""punch"" (I had maybe thought he meant ""pound""). 
  
He puts a finger to his lips and his hand on my leg and tells me that if he had the energy I would be ""bleeding by now"". He is obviously fucked up from the E, drinks and weed and is slurring as well as muttering in what I guess was Polish. I tell him that I liked it rough but not that rough still thinking he was masculine and misplaced words.
  
He gets real quiet and starts a monologue about how he meets men in order to ""scare them"". I don't even have to ask any questions as he tells me exactly what he means. He explains that he meets guys because he hates gays and feels it is his duty to ""stop them"". 
  
At this point I can feel myself drunkenly sober with my stomach screaming and myself starting to rush. 
  
He goes on to tell me that he meets ""gays who pretend to be men"" (I take this as masculine/non-sterotypical gays) so that he can fight them and ""faggots"" so that he can humiliate and rape them. 
  
At this point I'm just totally still and anxiety is rushing, I'm working out whether I can take this guy, has he got anything around him he may use, where am I, can I use my phone without setting him off.... 
  
He places a hand on my leg and says that I am ""lucky and that this was my chance to leave"", he repeated ""you should go to door"". I remain still and nervous as I don't want to just run and turn my back on him leaving myself defenseless.
  
I try talking to him and he just continues to slur his words from Polish to English whilst making fists and telling me to ""go to door or be like others"". 
  
I light a cigarette and tell him that I will leave when I finish my cigarette (stupid but I wasnt showing any weakness just in case). 
  
He takes his dick out, tells me not to look and gets up and goes to a door, as he opened it I could see it was the bathroom. I get up.
  
I move to the front door and as I try to open it it is stuck, I try all the locks and bolts and realise it is locked. I slapped the door as he comes out telling me to be quiet. I'm still. 
  
He stumbles over with his trousers round his ankles and boxers lopsided with his dick out, i can see where he has pissed on himself. He grabs my arm really tight and forces me out the way, i push him back and he grabs with his other arm and i just kind of convulsed him away. He stumbles, grabs the wall and door to steady himself. Mumbles in Polish and then states ""this is why I'm lucky"".
  
He opens the door (I guess there was a trick or whatever) swings it open and tells me to leave. I keep him in front of me all the while, grabbing my stuff from his table which I had forgot earlier feeling more confident that he is incapacitated but that I still feel anxious and in danger. 
  
I keep him in front of me as i make it outside the door and 'bam' he just slams the door shut hard. Nothing else. 
  
I left his building went back to the bench, rolled a spliff and started to walk around as I had very little idea where I was. I managed to get back to the hotel and I was relatively fine apart from being rather shaken and confused. 
    
This video really reminds me of that moment, I totally judged the guy who was killed as he was going to do something bad to the other guy based on some points of memory from my situation. I found the whole video incredibly powerful and I am surprised how well it shocked me. I get that there is a specific message in regards to specific people but the message that I got was how bad we can be at judging characters based on our desires which we attempt to hide and how in those moments we can't react as we know we should. 
  
My situation never really changed that much about me for all kinds of reasons but the one thing out of all of it that I have never forgot is how the room and his mood changed and I could just feel it in my stomach.

If you believe in a god or practice religion then I don't really want those people making policies or decisions as I believe them to be close minded, hateful, anti-science and disingenuous. 
  
People may tell us to mind our own business but we feel that religion is harmful/neglectful to society, the environment and those who are indoctrinated into it, therefore we try to educate people as well as providing societal and political/legal support to those who need it.

Not sure how serious your comment is but in the last few years sex crimes are easily associated with religion. This is a sub which discusses religion in all contexts and a element of religion is sexual abuse, so the post is in line with the discussion often presented in this sub."
atheism,fdiyuf8,t1_fdid13j,1578454195.0,"It is fine to criticise religion as a whole but when you pick a religion that isn't as strongly associated with a particular society then it appears to some that criticism maybe ethnocentric and verging on racism/xenophobia rather than theism. 
  
In ""the west"" -some- people may feel criticising Islam, specifically, is criticising people from a different country for reasons specific to that country. It is pretty common in the extreme left-wing groups who attempt to apply equality/equity to all demographics of people in a restrictive way, it seems they don't see that religion is a choice and therefore that is open to criticism. What they do see, often focus on, is the skin colour or origin/heritage of a person/group which isn't fair to criticise, which most agree to as those things are not a choice. 
  
To be totally honest, I'm a massive critic of all religion and I am very happy to heavily critique any religion, however, I have noticed I'm more restrained about Islam. I believe this to be (it's also a criticism of organised religion in general) because religion in the modern era is a cultural/political endeavour which is used to make excuses of behaviour/lack of critical thinking. As I view religion as a cultural factor and a political weapon, and as I have no real experience in an Islamic country, sometimes I feel my views maybe seen as ethnocentric rather than criticising theism. 
  
For example, if an Iraqi criticised Islam, it is ""more acceptable"" to an American as Islam is associated with Iraq and therefore self-critiquing is seen as political, so the belief is, the Iraqi has the experience and knowledge to criticise their ""own"" religion. Where as another American doesn't and issues with Islam is likely viewed as a racial/cultural issue. 
  
In regards to other subs, other than this great place, there is anonymity and people may not realise you have personal/cultural experience with Islam and therefore will assert themselves as protecting a ""minority group"" which people from the west view Islam as a factor of. 
  
In reality, it is an over sensitivity to minority groups and their culture, which the extreme left are defenders of and rightly so to some extent. It's just they miss that in other parts of the world those groups considered a minority in the west are the majority in their own societies and are just as open to being close minded indoctrinated cunts as the west."

That being said, after 8 years aren't you sick of the shame you feel your SO brings you in regards to your family. I get that it's difficult and may be painful but you've had a loving person in your life, that is very rare compared to parents who disagree with parts of their childs lives. It is clear that family is important to you but living here in the UK and being part of the community surely shows you that real family is made. 
  
What is a real shame, I don't mean any offence at all, is that at this moment you only half love your family and your SO, keeping such secrets and being ashamed of them in turn makes it seem you have other options. Sadly, you do not and it is totally unfair to your SO most of all who has stood by your side for 8 years. You need to bite the bullet and tell them something.
  
My advice, lead with how you feel, how you've been supported and how your SO has made you happy, so happy that you have decided to share your lives together. You don't even have to talk about it being a man initially just show them first and foremost that you are happy and have found someone to share your life with. When and if questions come, from your post, just tell them that you don't want to ruin what you have with your family but that you can't stop how you feel and discussion on this can be very minimal. 
  
My personal belief would be that what you have is very rare and to spoil that by your prejudices of other peoples prejudices means you do not love your SO as much as you think and it might be worthwhile considering which is most important to you, the past or the future.

I'll post this one as it is my most recent claim but as I have said the responsibility doesn't lay with me to offer a source for everything I say as not all of it is based on statistics, some based on my experience with a demographic, some based on conjecture and some based on current or recent research as well as testimonials of experts, which I am not."
DontFuckWithCats,fe9l6jq,t1_fe9jfbr,1578938986.0,"Can you explain the gender issue to me? 
  
I believe criticism is weighted towards the extent of how much we saw the people interviewed. Further, the documentary focuses and gives more time to the lady as there are more personal investments considered by her, for example her feeling targeted by TM. 
  
There hasn't been as much criticism towards the biker guy, who I believe to be an aggressor in regards to the situation involving ""Jamsey"" because he doesn't appear as much and doesn't constitute to the narrative as much as the others. 
  
I'm not insulted, I'm incredibly confused as to why you believe there is a gender issue and viewed my comment as such without this being about you and your issues. The only gender issue that could be pulled is that there has been a focus on TM's mother and not the absent father and yet again that's because the documentary does not focus on that. 
   
I don't need your ""food for thought"" or your appreciation, respectfully. You have created an issue where there is none and I believe this to be an attempt at moral superiority because it doesn't appear that you have anything meaningful to add to the conversation. 
  
I think you should reflect on your sensitivity to gender as an issue and why you believe that your opinion on gender supersedes the discussion at hand."
DontFuckWithCats,fe9i749,t1_fe9glqa,1578937760.0,I refer to them both when needed and the lady specifically as the documentary focuses on her more and I believe her behaviour worse. My comments have nothing to do with her being a woman and I don't believe her behaviour or my criticism relates to gender at all. The first person to bring gender up as an issue within this debate is you and I think that is more telling of your view as seeing women as sensitive and vulnerable. You are the sexist my mate x

DontFuckWithCats,fe8ux8y,t1_fe8smk9,1578931165.0,"Well, thanks for your opinion my mate. 
  
You can find lots of information on how childhood abuse and neglect lead people to commit all kinds of ""crimes"" from abusing drugs to people. In the UK over 28% of criminals who have served a sentence longer than 5 months were in care, that is, were orphaned or removed from their original family due to abuse/neglect etc. 
  
If you are truly interested, read Dr Richard Bentall's books as he has a very good exploration of childhood trauma vs adult mental health, psychosis, specifically hallucinations, and how this effects adult behaviour and achievement. 
  
I'd also argue the definition of a ""criminal"" as if you are truly interested, there are tons of books on forensic psychology with all kinds of findings suggesting people may be more likely to commit crime from birth due to genetics or based on status rewards etc etc. For instance, murder is considered an incredibly damaging crime to society but yet most murders are spontaneous rather than organised, so a totally normal healthy person may murder out of the blue due to threat etc. Also, if you are interested, look into books on comparing murderers and soldiers where the behaviour is similar but the justification is very different, yet there are high correlations of history between soldiers and murderers. 
  
There is data it's just not as palatable as documentaries on Netflix. 
  
I accept your apology. X"
DontFuckWithCats,fe8rn70,t1_fe8mb30,1578929818.0,"""I think that lots of people have abusive childhoods and don't go on to kill. I think he was an adult and responsible for his own actions. Lastly, he was self promoting with ""sock puppet"" accounts so he'd have gotten his attention regardless of the ""reckless sleuths"". When I was reading this I has to ready a rope team because I had to travel as far as you did up your own arse to read it and it was a little scary.""
  
Where do you address the specific two issues I described? 
  
""Lots of people have abusive childhoods but don't go on to kill"" correct, but when you read the psychiatric evaluation you understand that he didn't have a support network, never adjusted to schools or other groups and had watched animal abuse as well as being abused. ""I think he was an adult and responsible...."" this was exactly what I referred to from the psychiatric evaluation as well as the documentary and the other comments I referred you to in that, even with all the historic abuse he was still aware of his actions and how they would affect others. 
  
Perhaps he may have got the attention without these particular internet ""sleuths"" but that does not detract from the idea that we observe them rallying and fortifying themselves as a group to ""take down evil"" when I believe the specific things that these specific people did garnered more attention globally and emotionally than anything else, evidenced by TM's leaving ""clues"" that were specific to the groups ""investigating"". 
  
Then you fall into insulting me and my writing which I originally chose to ignore. Since you started your comments you've had a confrontational attitude and I can't help but feel like you have an issue that won't be resolved. 
  
As I stated noone else in the people who have commented or messaged me have stated that they found my comment hard to read and if they did I guess they commented on the stuff they did understand. I don't know, I'm not responsible for anyone else being able to understand my ideas other than stating them and reference why I came to that conclusion, I stated the two points I thought were missing, why they were important and referenced my thoughts based on either the psychiatric evaluation or the documentary. 
  
I'd disagree with them contacting the police as stated in the interviews they maintained an assumption that the ""police wouldn't help people on facebook"" and that ""i have no jurisdiction"". This is in part why I believed them to be self focused as they made it ""their"" battle rather than being objective ""he is doing this to torment us"". 
  
If I stumbled across a video of kittens being killed and felt this was provocative to the extent that may lead to worse crimes; I would first report the video at the main source, look for authentication, then confirmation as to where this was happening as animal rights are not globally protected, then I would report the video, website and what information I have to the correct body of authorities as I am not someone who enforces the law nor am I equipped to do so. 
  
Let's be pedantic and take your comment as it is ""someone killing animals"" well I've watched documentaries about farming, slaughter and butchery, I've watched videos on the dog eating festival in Korea, I've watched documentaries about poaching all the whilst not making groups about these things as they are either currently being investigated, I think are wrong but suffer ethnocentrism or I don't believe lay people would add anything to the debate."
DontFuckWithCats,fe8l7pd,t1_fe8i4t2,1578927433.0,"Dude, you're being fairly confrontational and I don't understand why.... there have been plenty of other people who have read and understood so with all due respect you are in the minority and attacking me seems rather pointless as I have no idea who you are nor why I should care.
  
If you are truly interested, I can give you an abridged version:
   
Two points that arent explored in the documentary are: 1, the historic abuse and neglect suffered by TM, this is important to the development of his crimes as the psych evaluation describes and 2, the ""sleuths"" were reckless in the way they gave TM attention which rewarded him for his behaviour leading him to feel incentivised and organised."
DontFuckWithCats,fe8ghdx,t1_fe8egrt,1578925886.0,"To be honest with you, I think I was as concise as possible considering the amount of information there is available and how I tried to explain in terms which are easier to read. 
  
You can disagree with me as we all see things differently but I'm not responsible for your education. If you cannot understand my writing that's on you and you should take the same information I've read and write your own comment and make a better point."
DontFuckWithCats,fe8dr66,t1_fe7fxw5,1578925108.0,"I think you have missed the point of my comment, I'd point you to my other responses which detail more about TM."
DontFuckWithCats,fe8cd46,t1_fe6wp51,1578924742.0,Can you elaborate?
DontFuckWithCats,fe6tkgc,t1_fe6s9ov,1578904833.0,"That is my point exactly. I found myself talking at my TV when the mother started 'going on' because she was saying ""someone else was responsible"" and all I could think was ""yes, you, ya bitch"". That lack of self-awareness seems more like a defence mechanism considering the psychiatric evaluation shows that there were troubles from childhood caused by her. There aren't many mothers who nonchalantly explain their child left home and moved to a different city at 16 and truly Express happiness at that. 
  
Oh, as soon as she started talking I thought what a cunt (apologies). To be fair, I'm pretty biased when it comes to addiction and people who glorify or profit from it. I hate to seem like I don't care or that I'm dismissive of the cats being killed, I am not and it is often a sign of violent behaviour, but you can see that their involvement was more about them rather than the actual crime. She describes going through a break up and some difficulties outside of employment and it's very evident she was looking for a place to feel supported. Consensus is an incredibly powerful and rewarding thing. If I remember correctly, the two sleuths meet at the end and I'm sure there is some passive aggression over each others involvement and whether they would have maintained interest without one another being involved. 
  
In regards to your last sentence, that and their belligerence with the police to involve them rather than just handing over their evidence."
DontFuckWithCats,fe6ss2n,t1_fe6quqn,1578903691.0,"I think in most -social discussion- mental health is often depicted as psychosis which can be interactional but is often conflated with offending behaviours, disproportionately. Mental health is such a wide spectrum that it can be hard to evaluate, especially when it comes to crimes that are violent and sadistic.
  
The biggest variable in regards to mental health, including psychosis, and offending behaviours is self-awareness. If an individual is able to understand what they were doing and how their behaviour effects others this supersedes all mental health as it is fairly rare for someone to be episodic constantly. 
  
An individual can have serious mental health issues and episodic psychosis and still be incredibly clever and sophisticated as well as understanding. What we see in TM and his evaluation is that, although he most likely has suffered severe mental health issues in his past which left him without the tools to adequately deal with adult emotional problems, he is still able to function and understand social expectations, or lack thereof, and that's why he was responsible for his behaviour. 
  
Sadly, the legal system often conflates mental health with lack of agency against well held research. Although his historic abuse and neglect may have led to a lot of his adult problems they are not the sole reasons for his behaviour. 
  
I have seen it so many times, I've worked with vulnerable men in substance dependency, abuse and offence behaviours, typically there are long histories of impoverished mental health but they are still able to understand their actions are wrong, misplaced or unhealthy. So of course its understandable that TM displays narcissism and grandiose but does not want to relate that to his actions because it appears to minimise his agency. Which from the sadistic, controlling and elusive nature of his crimes seems to be what he gained pleasure from. 
  
I do have to say that the people involved in the documentary seem like total cunts (apologies), from the sleuths to the mother, it seems about perpetuating their lack of involvement (mother) and involvement (sleuths). 
  
TM shows lots of signs of sophisticated manipulation even with a less than great academic history with lots of educational and social deficits. I think he craved love all of his life, never found it and objectified his emotions through methods of control. He grew up with animals and was heart broken by the mistreatment of his pets so for them to become the target of his control seems understandable considering the pleasure he may have received from ""regaining control"". I imagine this, doubled with the histrionics that were rewarded from his videos, made it all the more appealing to go for the next thing he seemingly was unable to control in his life, his relationships with people."

AskReddit,fe2p87e,t3_endl16,1578841375.0,"It was a couple of years ago when I was on a night out in my city. Granted I was pretty fucked up. I was going to meet my friend who was the manager of a small ""cool"" bar. 
  
Me and 2 of my friends had been singing whilst walking up the street, we got to the bar as I was finishing my fag and there happened to be a new doorman. He says that my two friends can go in, who are girls, but waits till they've gone in to tell me that I can't as I'm too drunk. 
  
I said that we were all pretty much the same and that he was being a dick, the other doorman said to let me in as he recognised me. This doorman exploded, grabbed my hand and attempted to push me to the floor, I staggered down the street and he said to ""fuck off f****t"".
  
At this moment I was enraged and so i called my friend, the manager, and told him that the bouncer wouldn't let me in and just called me a f****t. Not one minute later my friend came bursting out of the door and asked the doorman if he liked his job and why he called me a f****t. He started muttering that he wouldn't let me in because the girls said I was following them, clear lie and that he thought I was too drunk and would cause problems.
  
My friend sacked him on the spot, which happened to be his first night, he kicked off saying that he wasn't sacked as he was hired by the owner and that the owner told him he could use his initiative and so he was staying. 
  
My friend informed him that his Dad was the owner and knows that he wouldn't say that and regardless he is the manager and wants him away from the property. At which point the other doorman steps in and tells him that he should leave as he is causing trouble. I'm just stood there smoking at this point. 
  
He then exclaims to everyone that he is the doorman (""I AM THE DOORMAN"") and he will stay until the shift is over as he is the doorman (""I AM THE DOORMAN"") and he will work his shift. 
  
My manager just simply said you can either get your belongings and leave or he'd call the police and he would be asked to leave. His response, ""I am the doorman, bring them."". 
  
My friends come outside to the smoking area and bring me a drink, the doorman kicks of saying drinks arent allowed and my friend says it is fine, at this point he won't let me walk any further into the area and just continues to stand in front of the gates not allowing anyone in, so at this point it is causing a bigger scene as this bar is the typical after party bar. 
  
The police arrive and ask what the problem is, seeing me slumped with a drink in one hand and a ciggy in the other. The manager comes out and attempts to speak but the doorman just exclaims ""I am the doorman, you need to get this faggot away"". My friend rushes in and tells them he is the manager and he made the call. 
  
He tells the police that this doorman has been terminated, refuses to leave the premise and is threatening people who approach, explains the situation, all the while I'm still there just chilling pretty much whilst some people are asking me what happened. It looked like a real shit show scene. 
  
2 minutes later the police tell him that he needs to leave as he has been asked by the manager. He starts exclaiming ""I am the doorman"" and proceeds to explain that he doesn't have to leave. The police give him one last warning and he responds with ""I am the doorman"". 
  
He is then subdued and put into the police car. I finish my cig and my manager is taking the piss out of me and seemingly pissed off at the situation so I'm feeling fairly guilty at this point. He gives me a big fish bowl and tells me he will be down soon. 
  
Found out after that this doorman had been causing problems most of the night, before 1am it's a really chilled bar with a good swank to it but this doorman had been refusing men entrance and that he was telling them ""I am the doorman"" so the girls were immediately complaining and either leaving or telling my manager who had to go allow them in. Making him redundant. 
  
Sad thing is my friends dad also owns other places as well as knowing most of the doorman staff as they belong to either one main company or are shared by the same bars and clubs he employs security for other businesses. So it's safe to say that he wasn't employed by any of them, not sure what happened to him after being driven away.

It truly made me think about how situations progress so easily and how at ease we can be with certain things even knowing they are -at least- risky. I truly believe this video and the people involved to be incredibly commendable for this piece of ""warning art"". 
  
It so bitter sweet because I went on to get a degree in psychology and work with vulnerable men from all kinds of situations and sadly, my account and the videos content are not that rare. Even with this, I'd still say it is hard to weigh up those risks compared to the ""reward"" as you say ""you can never really know"" and constantly searching for an end to loneliness feels more important than analysing the risk you face along the way. Yet, I have totally experienced people ""weaponsing"" those feelings, even if it doesn't seem as dangerous as my situation, in order to please themselves at the detriment of others. 
  
Thank you for adding to the discussion my mate x"
gaybros,fdnrz9o,t3_em9lit,1578591639.0,"About 8 years ago I was in London on a trip. I had been to bars and clubs with my friends but failed to hook up and as I had been talking to a guy on grindr I decided to meet him. 
  
We met in a bar and had a few drinks, had smoked a spliff outside and decided to go back to his flat. All the while had been amazing, totally charming and jokey, fairly masculine but ""gay"" interests. 
  
On the way back to his flat I asked if he wanted to split an E and stop off to get some more drinks. We dropped the E in the back of the taxi and got out near an off license near his building. 
  
From the off license we walked to his flat with us both being in good spirits and being flirty touching one another etc. We did sit on a bench for a bit whilst I rolled a spliff and talked.
  
We get to his building at at this point the E us kicking in as I can feel myself coming up, I can see he is coming up too and doesn't seem to be as experienced. I ask if he is okay and tell him we can just chill for a bit no pressure on anything happening. 
  
We get into his flat and his mood and demeanour just completely change. There are very few instances where I can describe how instant and dramatic this change was. It was like everything was sucked out of me apart from this feeling of dread and there was a little feeling in my stomach making me feel more focused.
  
He was in a different state and seemed to be rushing loads, he fell on the sofa, told me where the glasses were rather sternly and told me to pour. I did.
  
As we were sat there he started to drink and I started to feel really uncomfortable as he just seemed so different (even taking into account we had dropped). 
  
He was fairly quiet except long breaths and sighs. He then rushed with energy sits up and says to me ""I'm not gay, I hate gays"" and proceeds to look at me and slap his hand on me shoulder/back. 
   
I asked him what he meant, I'm caring and as he was Polish I thought maybe he was just not used to being ""himself"" or had opinions about the ""gay community"" as opposed to ""gays"" which are two different things.
  
He replied ""no"" and just gave me this long stare into my eyes that just gave me chills and made me uncomfortable. This was not the guy I had spent the evening with at all. 
  
He sits back, explains that I am ""good"" as I'm a big guy (6ft2 and a beast back then) and whatever ""faggot pill"" I have given him has chilled him out and left him unable to ""punch"".
  
As uncomfortable as I was I was very reckless in those days and seemingly tolerant to drugs giving me this weird mix of confident anxiety. 
  
I asked him what he meant and did he mean to say the word ""punch"" (I had maybe thought he meant ""pound""). 
  
He puts a finger to his lips and his hand on my leg and tells me that if he had the energy I would be ""bleeding by now"". He is obviously fucked up from the E, drinks and weed and is slurring as well as muttering in what I guess was Polish. I tell him that I liked it rough but not that rough still thinking he was masculine and misplaced words.
  
He gets real quiet and starts a monologue about how he meets men in order to ""scare them"". I don't even have to ask any questions as he tells me exactly what he means. He explains that he meets guys because he hates gays and feels it is his duty to ""stop them"". 
  
At this point I can feel myself drunkenly sober with my stomach screaming and myself starting to rush. 
  
He goes on to tell me that he meets ""gays who pretend to be men"" (I take this as masculine/non-sterotypical gays) so that he can fight them and ""faggots"" so that he can humiliate and rape them. 
  
At this point I'm just totally still and anxiety is rushing, I'm working out whether I can take this guy, has he got anything around him he may use, where am I, can I use my phone without setting him off.... 
  
He places a hand on my leg and says that I am ""lucky and that this was my chance to leave"", he repeated ""you should go to door"". I remain still and nervous as I don't want to just run and turn my back on him leaving myself defenseless.
  
I try talking to him and he just continues to slur his words from Polish to English whilst making fists and telling me to ""go to door or be like others"". 
  
I light a cigarette and tell him that I will leave when I finish my cigarette (stupid but I wasnt showing any weakness just in case). 
  
He takes his dick out, tells me not to look and gets up and goes to a door, as he opened it I could see it was the bathroom. I get up.
  
I move to the front door and as I try to open it it is stuck, I try all the locks and bolts and realise it is locked. I slapped the door as he comes out telling me to be quiet. I'm still. 
  
He stumbles over with his trousers round his ankles and boxers lopsided with his dick out, i can see where he has pissed on himself. He grabs my arm really tight and forces me out the way, i push him back and he grabs with his other arm and i just kind of convulsed him away. He stumbles, grabs the wall and door to steady himself. Mumbles in Polish and then states ""this is why I'm lucky"".
  
He opens the door (I guess there was a trick or whatever) swings it open and tells me to leave. I keep him in front of me all the while, grabbing my stuff from his table which I had forgot earlier feeling more confident that he is incapacitated but that I still feel anxious and in danger. 
  
I keep him in front of me as i make it outside the door and 'bam' he just slams the door shut hard. Nothing else. 
  
I left his building went back to the bench, rolled a spliff and started to walk around as I had very little idea where I was. I managed to get back to the hotel and I was relatively fine apart from being rather shaken and confused. 
    
This video really reminds me of that moment, I totally judged the guy who was killed as he was going to do something bad to the other guy based on some points of memory from my situation. I found the whole video incredibly powerful and I am surprised how well it shocked me. I get that there is a specific message in regards to specific people but the message that I got was how bad we can be at judging characters based on our desires which we attempt to hide and how in those moments we can't react as we know we should. 
  
My situation never really changed that much about me for all kinds of reasons but the one thing out of all of it that I have never forgot is how the room and his mood changed and I could just feel it in my stomach. 
  
Stay safe brothers."

It is a tool to deliver CBT and makes use of mindfulness techniques, however, we had discussed potential ""invasive app designs"" which would help challenge habitual behaviours such as smoking etc. 
  
It has been a while since I have seen it and I never worked on it myself but the potential of using an invasive design and mindfulness are of benefit as it can preempt cravings and disrupt habitual thoughts."

atheism,fdj3gkl,t3_elj7k2,1578457432.0,"It isn't that different to this sub as we have common ideas and some of us a common goal. 
  
If you believe in a god or practice religion then I don't really want those people making policies or decisions as I believe them to be close minded, hateful, anti-science and disingenuous. 
  
People may tell us to mind our own business but we feel that religion is harmful/neglectful to society, the environment and those who are indoctrinated into it, therefore we try to educate people as well as providing societal and political/legal support to those who need it. 
  
Religion has held a monopoly for a long time so religious people are right to feel displaced or attacked as our societies slowly but surely become less religious."
atheism,fdj19g7,t1_fdi79qv,1578455866.0,"To some degree, but I believe this has been posted here due to the high correlation of sexual abuse and religious belief. 
  
Religion does not do enough to condemn sexual abuse and in most cases offenders use religion to justify their crimes. 
  
Not sure how serious your comment is but in the last few years sex crimes are easily associated with religion. This is a sub which discusses religion in all contexts and a element of religion is sexual abuse, so the post is in line with the discussion often presented in this sub."
atheism,fdiyuf8,t1_fdid13j,1578454195.0,"It is fine to criticise religion as a whole but when you pick a religion that isn't as strongly associated with a particular society then it appears to some that criticism maybe ethnocentric and verging on racism/xenophobia rather than theism. 
  
In ""the west"" -some- people may feel criticising Islam, specifically, is criticising people from a different country for reasons specific to that country. It is pretty common in the extreme left-wing groups who attempt to apply equality/equity to all demographics of people in a restrictive way, it seems they don't see that religion is a choice and therefore that is open to criticism. What they do see, often focus on, is the skin colour or origin/heritage of a person/group which isn't fair to criticise, which most agree to as those things are not a choice. 
  
To be totally honest, I'm a massive critic of all religion and I am very happy to heavily critique any religion, however, I have noticed I'm more restrained about Islam. I believe this to be (it's also a criticism of organised religion in general) because religion in the modern era is a cultural/political endeavour which is used to make excuses of behaviour/lack of critical thinking. As I view religion as a cultural factor and a political weapon, and as I have no real experience in an Islamic country, sometimes I feel my views maybe seen as ethnocentric rather than criticising theism. 
  
For example, if an Iraqi criticised Islam, it is ""more acceptable"" to an American as Islam is associated with Iraq and therefore self-critiquing is seen as political, so the belief is, the Iraqi has the experience and knowledge to criticise their ""own"" religion. Where as another American doesn't and issues with Islam is likely viewed as a racial/cultural issue. 
  
In regards to other subs, other than this great place, there is anonymity and people may not realise you have personal/cultural experience with Islam and therefore will assert themselves as protecting a ""minority group"" which people from the west view Islam as a factor of. 
  
In reality, it is an over sensitivity to minority groups and their culture, which the extreme left are defenders of and rightly so to some extent. It's just they miss that in other parts of the world those groups considered a minority in the west are the majority in their own societies and are just as open to being close minded indoctrinated cunts as the west."
