I can lose weight, these lads can't grow. I think half of it is that they think a short lad is going to have a short you know what. I've been out with a couple of short guys and that point was proven in afraid.
These girls would be mortified if the men said to them, she is a bit chunky for me. Especially when they have probably all been on the slim fast all over Xmas.
I don't take offence if I'm too big for someone and the short lads I've know have been 50/50 some have had an attitude some have not given a fuck.
People do like different things, but I agree, you wouldn't get a boy going on there saying he doesn't fancy black girls. There would be uproar. It just gets skimmed over when the black girl who is usually always the fittest, gets picked last.
Asian boys have historically not done well on the show either, they made a big point of stating nas was half Asian and half of Caribbean dissent, to try and up his 'cool' states. Its a fucking sorry state of affairs.

It's a massive change, especially at the start, even more when you are getting nothing back. I genuinely think it took me 12 to 18 months to fully bond with my baby. He's 4 now and L literally worship him, he's the best thing that has ever happened to me. I've got my career back, it's going better than ever and I'm managing it as a single mum. He's amazing, funny, well adjusted and very loving. It is rewarding I promise.
It's just such a massive massive change, don't beat yourself up for feeling how you do right now. If you have the means, go and speak to someone about this who is impartial and can help you with how you are feeling.
Do you both have to be with the baby of an evening? Yes you do have to do your fair share, you did sign up to this but there is no reason you can't go to the gym a few times a week or go and see friends. So can she?

I lost my mum at 16, I definitely held it together for the first 6 weeks or so and then it really hit me. My dad wasn't great and moved on really quickly. He was with my mum at the time of her passing.
I can honestly say it effected me massively for the next 20 years.
I wish I had been given support, I 100%needed counselling.
My dad wasn't in a fit state to support us, and it did effect my adulthood I went off the rails, not to a massive extent but it changed my personality a huge amount. My life would of been so different without her passing away.

My only advice would be to cut some slack if there is some acting up. Offer therapy, if he doesn't like the therapist, keep going until he finds one he does. Be there for him. I'm sure you will do an amazing job of helping him through this tough time in his life. Could maybe be worth you getting some advice from a professional. All you can be is his mum. Good luck xx"

relationships,fdicplr,t3_eljeve,1578439922.0,"I think she's obviously fuming that he has met someone else and is jealous of you.
Social media is the devil, she could portray her relationship however she wanted it to. Yes they had IVF, this could of still been to paper over the cracks. I know plenty of unhappy relationships that look amazing on Instagram as well.
There's nothing worse than the bitter ex rampaging on with status' or posts everyday. She isn't stupid, if she has got him and everyone else blocked but not you... Who are those posts for?
If you kick off and it gets back to her, you have played right into her hands. This is exactly what she wants.
They are divorced, it's over, he wants to be with you. He probably hasn't introduced you to his child because he knows the ex is going to ramp up the crazy scale when he does.
Weirdly enough, as soon as she starts seeing someone she won't give a shit and will probably want your bf to have the child more so she can go out and have weekends away etc.
She's hurting and I get that, but she is also being a bit of a Karen and an oversharer.
I wouldn't say anything, you are never going to know exactly what went down. Just make sure your socials are private and stay classy.
My ex bf's ex wife loved a stalk on my insta and 100% didn't know that I would be aware that she had seen my stories and she was the one that didn't want to be with him and had moved on straight away. People are weird and possessive at times, even when they don't want someone. I'm sure it will all fall into place."

Sounds like instead of being depressed about it, she is trying to embrace it more. If it helps her mental health and gets her through her day happier, I'm all for it.
If she comes to you for help on her weight and asks for some advice be sure to point her in the right direction. Unless you are a medical professional or have dropped a lot of weight yourself, id not get involved. In 90% of cases when someone has the weight chat with you... You go and overeat. You are not helping. This is not Shallow Hal, she doesn't look in the mirror and see a size 6. Her talking about body positivity on social media might even be false confidence but if you call her out on it or make her feel like shit, that could hurt her mentally.

I'm going to be honest, as an overweight mum who has struggled all her adult life and had a skinny mum who literally fed me non stop... No one wants to be the fat kid. It isn't a happy life. I am cautious what I give my child. People are gobsmacked that he loves salad and vegetables, yes he can also smash a maccies but everything in moderation. When they are 5 in the UK school weigh and measure the kids and letters get sent home if the child is overweight.
My lad is very active and we do loads of classes on a weekend, so then I don't have to say no to snacks if he's hungry and fancies eating a bit of crap. I am lucky though he will beg for a whole bell pepper out of the fridge (strange child) I don't tend to have a lot of shit in though, because then I will eat it all.
It does need to be addressed though, the health implications are massive and it could be recitifed so quickly and easily at a young age.
It is going to cause an upset but if the child is double the recommended weight that is just cruel and unhealthy. Have you got the time to spare to offer to take him to a sports class once a week and then say swimming? If his mum and dad agree to rein in the deep fried food he is living on? You are being a great big brother showing your concern and wanting to help. Will he eat any healthy foods?
