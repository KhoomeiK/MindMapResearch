Yes it is one thing if I have ball in hand, with my own balls to pocket and i intentionally hit a shot to mess with you and repeating it.  That is a jerk move(s)

But as a player that wants to get better, I know I need to work on playing defense, sometimes it comes at the expense of being a jerk or practicing when I have ball in hand."

8BallPool,ffgt6yi,t3_etig81,1579914435.0,"Ive never heard of anyone complaining about the graphics. This app isn't about that, play another game or irl if you want better graphics. 

Pool isn't for everyone. This is a game of patience. Not about winning the match with each shot, but winning little battles. Looking ahead with each shot and if I don't have a shot, how do I make a shot that will make it difficult for my opponent to run the table."

Yes there is luck, but skills as well."
