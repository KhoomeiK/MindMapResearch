Or you can just die. And starve. And still pay taxes here too. And rent even in the worst areas of our poorest cities is well over $500 a month for a decent place to live. I think the cheapest here I've seen in the ""hood"" for a rundown efficiency (no bedroom) apartment was $525. And we have no dependable public transportation. So you'd better have a car and be able to pay for that gas and insurance (well over $100 a month) if you ever hope to have a job.
