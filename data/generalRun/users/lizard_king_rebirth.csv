todayilearned,ffmu3ss,t1_ffmpiys,1580058920.0,"In some places, sure. But that also means quality of work has to be important to the bosses of the managers. I have worked in management before, and in my most recent managerial role, while it was easy (if time consuming) for me to check the quality of the work my team was doing, my boss didn't care about the actual quality of the work being done, he cared that the team and individual employees were hitting the metrics that were being monitored by the people above him. I had to fire a number of employees who were producing a higher quality of work than others because they were not meeting productivity metrics (often by the slimmest of margins) or the terrible ""QA"" metrics, that actually didn't measure the quality of the work being done, but only if certain narrowly defined and easily repeatable parameters were adhered to. 

I was pulled aside multiple times by my boss and given talkings-to for standing up for quality employees and trying to fight back against the stupidity of the metrics people were being measured on, and eventually put on a warning and moved to ""employee not in good standing"" status because I would not stop questioning the validity of what we were being asked/told to do. I stepped down from my managerial role (I didn't leave the company because my wife and I need insurance and the benefits and pay are good) and am now just a regular team member, and guess what? This week we had a meeting about how QA and productivity metrics are being revamped again because the way they were previously being measured was deemed ineffective by the new department head (3rd in the last year). 

So maybe where you are managing, you have a really easy way of checking quality. Or maybe you just think you do.

I'm not trying to take anything away from Edwards, but just saying that our RB combo was as good as that of the Ravens.

Would you really call the Ravens offensive weapons unbelievable?

I don't think I'd call Hollywood Brown, Mark Andrews, Willie Snead, Hayden Hurst, Nick Boyle and Seth Roberts an amazing group of pass catchers either.

This has to be a joke...An 8 yard run on 1st down and you think it's stupid to try and run twice for 2 yards on 2nd and 3rd down? Also Russell was getting all day to throw on those play action calls a lot of the time.

Sure but Russ has not proven to be great at those short throws over the course of his career. Maybe there's something to the fact that he's better at executing plays like that under pressure.

Gee, why did nobody ever think of that? I mean, why didn't the Packers just think to use the same game plan in the 2nd half that had them up 21-3 in the first half????? Also, it's really fucking hard to establish the run with your top-3 RB's are out and you are playing a guy who hadn't played in 14 months before week 17 and another guy who was your 4th stringer and had touched the ball like 5 times before week 17."
Seahawks,fecyy5o,t1_fecyo0k,1578990456.0,So what should the game plan have been?

Seahawks,fecy7z7,t1_fecy4r8,1578989506.0,It seems like maybe you didn't watch the game.
Seahawks,fecxw5o,t1_fecxpia,1578989093.0,"Lol it's not a ""plan"" to be down 21-3. GB is the fastest starting teams in the league and we are one of the slowest. There was no way we were going to hold their offense back in the first half. But, we were able to keep the game within reach, and to give our offense a chance in the second half. Even with all of the injuries we suffered this year, the game came down to the last 5 minutes of the 4th quarter. You really can't ask for much more than that, considering the position we were in due to injuries."
Seahawks,fecx4y7,t1_fecx1uj,1578988164.0,Yeah I guess no team has ever come back from a deficit like that.
Seahawks,fecwyyk,t1_fecvcws,1578987963.0,"Lol did you really think that the game plan against GB was bad? We were down our top 3 RB's, our offensive line was patchwork, we are a heavily run-based offense, and we were in the game to the end. If Turner catches that pass, when he was WIDE open, we are inside the 50 with under 3 minutes to go."
Seahawks,fecunvz,t1_fecukhx,1578985308.0,"I mean, to any sane person I feel like it must look like a joke. Though I understand that we are short of those on this sub."
Seahawks,fecuj0q,t1_fecuhml,1578985156.0,"I thought it was pretty clearly a joke, but I guess not. I should probably delete this post but I'm drunk, so we'll see."
Seahawks,fectput,t1_fe6v4wz,1578984239.0,I also missing having one of the best teams of all time.
