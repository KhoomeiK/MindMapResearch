I would come home after school and she would be still in PJs, messy hair, and full makeup because she went into my room and played with my cosmetics (that I paid for with child support from when alcoholic dumped me on grandma for several years previously). No intention of leaving the house that day, she was just playing with my stuff and using up anything I cherished.

They would regularly take my bedroom door off my hinges as punishment. If the door was locked my step monster would kick it in. I've been hit by the door that way. Pulled down the hallway by my hair. She would poke me in the sternum with her long claws and leave black and blue dots over my chest as she was talking at me within an inch of my face.

Because she has worked very hard at making your brain believe she is a danger to you so your mind is going into flight mode to escape this predator. 

The only solution to this is to get out of that house as soon as humanly possible. Begin forming a plan and collecting resources now. It may help you survive panic attacks if you can remind yourself that you only need more X dollars in savings to escape. Also, try going to your college's health center, they have resources to help deal with the stress.

As for your grandmother, she made that beast - literally! Your grandmother is also an adult who can set her own boundaries.
