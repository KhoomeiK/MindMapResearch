Three-quarters of all U.S. murders in 2017 – 14,542 out of 19,510 – involved a firearm. 

Lots of sources for this stuff that conflict, I just picked the first one that looked reputable for the sake of argument. 

Also, even with your numbers your math is off 517 out of 10600 is 4.88%, not 20%. 20% would be 2120. Using 14k from the Pew report 3.69%."
MurderedByWords,ffd1c82,t1_ffczzbt,1579811474.0,"7000 murders for half the year.... is half the number I said was the average for a full year. 7000 + 7000 is 14,000.

As I stated earlier, I don’t like guns and would have no issue making them illegal. I did, however, grow up around gun people. My dad owned multiple AR-15s and other guns and we could go shooting occasional. I consider shooting about as much fun as paint drying so didn’t get that far into the hobby.

As far as mass shooting statistics, there isn’t a uniform definition and folks quote wildly different numbers. I just picked the first one at random. You focused on a specific stat that has no bearing on my point though. Mass shootings are statistically irrelevant compared to all gun homicides."
nfl,ffcxv3t,t1_ffcvfwl,1579809527.0,I have been a Chiefs fan for my entire life. I wouldn't feel comfortable with any amount of lead until we have the final possession of the game and we are kneeling out the clock.
MurderedByWords,ffcnzcm,t1_ffci5id,1579803513.0,"Fire speed is as fast as you can pull he trigger is the same for either type of gun, we aren't talking about bolt action here, and many rifles have large clips. Literally the only real difference is one category is black and scary looking. I have shot many hunting rifles and many AR-15s. 

The left coming at this from a point of ignorance and hyper focusing on the wrong things shuts down dialog with gun owners. No wonder they are suspicious of their motives.

Shooting sprees are statistically irrelevant and probably should be more or less ignored at the national level. The attention they are getting is what is causing the surge over the past few years. Prior to 2008 they happened at roughly a similar rate but didn't really get the notoriety they do now. Even in the worst years 40-120 people die in mass shootings vs 14k gun related homicides (40k total gun deaths).

I am more interested in eliminating as many of the 14-40k of gun deaths as we can vs wasting time on the less than 1% that are mass shootings."

Hand guns are the real problem.

If I was a rural gun owner with hunting/target rifles I too would he against many gun control advocates because they are basically going after the black scary versions of the guns I already own.

Growing up I shot all sorts of guns. There is no difference between an AR-15 and hunting rifles as far as I can tell."

Burn off increasing is exactly what those calculations are about, BMR etc.

If it is true for a relatively big guy, it will be true for most.

Thinking that 200 over isn’t a big deal is dangerously wrong. It isn’t the the folks who are eating 12 pizzas in a sitting or whatever that is at the crux of the obesity epidemic. It is the folks that are going over by a tiny little bit most days over years."
