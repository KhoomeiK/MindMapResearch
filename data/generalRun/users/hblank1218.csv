mildlyinteresting,fcakfyb,t1_fcabo4k,1577570948.0,Which actually in my opinion would it make it that much cooler! I imagine in most situations they would likely just cut the tree down if it grew to interfere with the integrity of the wall. But in this case they beautifully accommodated that old and growing tree!
unpopularopinion,fcadzon,t3_egv11o,1577567616.0,"I could not agree more. I am dealing with my father who has a hard enough time walking, let alone operating a motor vehicle. He just isn’t in the best health both physically and mentally.  And it’s hard for him. He went from being a man who fixed everything around the house, worked on cars, and just was an overall badass to a man who can’t walk straight, isn’t stable, and often has a hard time judging distances. For a reference, he has a zero turn lawn mower and once wrecked it into a retaining wall, and then later into a large shed. For the most part he has agreed to no longer drive his annoyingly large truck. I am seeing how hard this is on him. He is relying on people to do things he would never ask for help with in the past. Driving is one of those things. He cannot stay alert enough to operate his vehicle. He is often confused. Taking his keys away makes him angry and impossible to deal with. Instead we offer to take him wherever he needs to go. So far we have been able to convince him not to drive. Life would be so much easier if he was required to pass a test so the state can be the ‘bad guy’ by taking away his license. That way I won’t have to be the bad guy."
