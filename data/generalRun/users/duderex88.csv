eatsandwiches,feth4zs,t1_fesux56,1579375408.0,I'm a southern transplant in southern California.  They have no good BBQ here. They dont even have vinegar based sauces here it's all that sweet ketchup shit. Also southern California doesn't have Caribbean food. I'd fight someone for a just ok spicy beef patty. We need to have food exchange programs to get decent local foods all over the country.
