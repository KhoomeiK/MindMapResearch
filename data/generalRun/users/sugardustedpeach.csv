Minecraft,ff81855,t3_es61kc,1579663329.0,"You don’t have a very good friend, there."
AskReddit,ff7j8o6,t1_ff7ilem,1579650840.0,"My parents still don’t get it. My grandparents still don’t get it. My husband’s family doesn’t get it.

Yet they still love who we are. They wouldn’t ask us to change a thing. I know that probably doesn’t mean much, but the fact they are accepting of who we are and willing to learn as we go means something.

Our family still misgenders my husband sometimes, but they’re getting better. They misgender me, but they’re getting better.

I agree that people have had plenty of time to learn. We also have to realize that our pronouns and terminologies are constantly changing to what feels comfortable for us. What fits our view of our lives. For somebody who wasn’t raised around that / only recently has shown interest in learning, it takes time to keep up. Not only that, it takes years to get over societal-ingrained bigotry to be willing enough to learn.

I know I likely sound like a complete idiot. Don’t get me wrong though, I agree with you. I’m angry about how long it takes for things. A lot of my friends are angry at the time it’s taken for us to even be acknowledged as we are. 

Again though; your anger is useful. Just direct it towards the people who are still actively trying to treat us as the mentally ill. Towards those who are trying to kill us, or take away our rights again.
OP certainly doesn’t seem to be one of those people, as far as I can tell."
AskReddit,ff7iake,t1_ff6zmgv,1579650197.0,"Not quite so;

‘Q’ is for people questioning their identities. In addition, it’s also for people who choose to reclaim the word from anti-gay propaganda/speech back in the day.

‘I’ is for intersex. Intersex people are not necessarily transgender; their gender difference is not in thought, but as far down as  their biology. Intersex people have different chromosomes, genomes, and other differences at birth that do not match your ‘average’ child (average being just a healthy baby).

I understand that the extra letters seem unnecessary, but for some people they’re a sense of belonging."
AskReddit,ff7hucd,t1_ff6yc96,1579649897.0,"Your opinion is entirely valid. I’m being entirely honest there 

I do wish there was some level of acceptance from you, though. The voice of somebody like you would make a prominent ally.

Regardless; I don’t want to change your mind. I just want to thank you for not being hateful."
AskReddit,ff7hm6m,t1_ff72ntn,1579649745.0,"I really hope you’re joking. 

We have people who are trying to learn about us. About what sort of terms we prefer. Shutting people down and labelling them as bigots does nothing unless that person actually intended harm to begin with.

We have been fighting for /decades/ for the chance for the non-LGBTQIA+ to listen to us. To be willing to be open. So why is it when people make the smallest mistake, we lump them in with those who want us dead?

OP made an effort here. I understand you’re angry, but surely you see past that mistake? They’re trying. I know it’s not perfect and we shouldn’t settle until we get the respect where there’s no forgetfulness, but we have to be patient for when we get there.

Take your anger about the lack of representation of intersex people in this conversation, and direct it towards people who are /actually/ bigoted towards the intersex members of /our/ community.

OP and I are not the enemy here."
AskReddit,ff71i5y,t1_ff6z7um,1579639260.0,"Opinion Time;

If people have an ‘abnormal’ set of pronouns they’d like to go by (anything apart from He/She/They), that’s alright. That’s cool. They just have to make sure they tell people around them what they’d like to use.

People who use any of those additional pronouns (Xe/Zhe Etc.) and get angry with other people for not addressing them with such without that person having ANY knowledge of them whatsoever before hand aren’t helping anybody. They just tend to make our community look even more whiny, odd, and crude.

Edit; I don’t think these additional pronouns are abnormal; I just use the term in reference to what people who aren’t usually exposed to Xhe/Zher think of them."
AskReddit,ff71565,t1_ff6xz1y,1579639049.0,"Not sure if you forgot an /s but 

Some people forget the I. Some people forget the A. Some people don’t even know the ‘IA’ at the end of LGBTQ(+). 
Jumping to conclusions about everybody being bigoted for a simple mistake isn’t going to make us any progress in being more widely accepted. It’s just going to make us seem like a bunch of crude people, like what some /actual/ bigots want us to look like.

Source: am LGBTQIA+. Have been for many years. Am tired of seeing everybody so ready to be angry when there’s not always a reason to."

relationships,fej916v,t1_fej8nd3,1579162154.0,"Well said. In addition, I believe you to be the person who’s been posting to this subreddit and several others about how you’ve threatened to commit suicide on your cousin’s bed, wanted to send her pictures of you committing suicide via exit bag..  

That’s not... normal. That’s not a normal way of trying to earn somebody’s affection. That’s scary and not something you should be pushing onto her or her boyfriend. As was said previously, you need to seek professional help through a therapist, not your cousin. The similarities between this post and others are creepily similar.

Even in the case you aren’t the same person? Sending pictures of you injuring yourself to your cousin and her boyfriend aren’t going to help your situation. Please seek therapy to help you find healthier coping methods over your cousin not liking you as much as you’d prefer."

AskReddit,fdmh6gg,t1_fdmfumh,1578549767.0,"Not really. I don’t mind having sex when I feel like it, but I just.. don’t want to do that super frequently. It’s rare that I have the drive, and I’m okay with that.

Sex is something where I have to be more vulnerable than I’m comfortable being. While I trust my fiancée 110%, it’s still hard to not be anxious about. 

Asexuals aren’t always people who haven’t had sex. Sometimes it’s people who just don’t want to do it, or have a repulsion to it for whatever reason."
