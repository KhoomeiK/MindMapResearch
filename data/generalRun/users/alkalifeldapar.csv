Kanye,feh4lai,t1_fegqjk2,1579109023.0,"Yeah, Yeezus was p lame tbh. I'm always amazed about the reputation it has on this sub. Makes me wonder how much music people on here listen to besides Kanye and artists that are Kanye adjacent."

depression_help,fdpo1ho,t1_fdpnku8,1578634240.0,"Yeah, and there are some great techniques in there. It's difficult to practice them at first, but if you keep it in mind, the techniques can work wonders for your mental health."
depression_help,fdpm2ub,t3_emm13w,1578632463.0,"I've been a broken record about this recently, but I've been reading the Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle, and it's helped me. I would highly recommend it especially in your case. It is rough, and not going to be a simple linear path to a better life, but the sooner you get started and when you realize it's about tenacity, the better."
CasualConversation,fdplnkq,t1_fdplflt,1578632098.0,"True, you have a point. But I guess fundamentally what I'm saying is that there's a huge gap between human beings and animals. I guess, if we somehow reach a point as a society that we accept animal lives as valuable as humans then yeah, but, again, I don't see that happening."
CasualConversation,fdpla3f,t3_emm06p,1578631775.0,"You experienced presence. In that moment you were enlightened. Congrats! It happens to everyone even if they don't notice, just glimpses of complete focus on one thing. 

Mine is working outside. My studies allow me to work in beautiful places, sometimes when I'm at a spot and working, then when I'm done with whatever task in doing I look around and it hits me."
CasualConversation,fdpl3jm,t1_fdpkv2j,1578631625.0,"I don't know, if you put it that way I dont have that much confidence that people would feel guilt about factory farming. I'd hope the general consensus would be, like, feeling guilty about racism or enslavement of other humans. Of course, id be great if people would be more consciousous of factory farming, but I dunno, I just don't see it"

depression_help,fdp7t8u,t3_emjohq,1578622013.0,"Hello,
It sounds like you're severely discouraged. It happens, dealing with depression is more of a rollercoaster than a linear path towards getting better. The important part is being tenacious. I know perseverance, right now, seems impossible, but you're in a state where your depressive thoughts are controlling you."
Mindfulness,fdml3oy,t3_em4pe2,1578553987.0,"To reiterate, yeah, some days are rough, some days are easy, just got to keep practicing. 

I'm not going to say I'm close suicide, I know I can never really go through with that, but the thoughts are there. I was doing well until a few days ago, but I'm kind of excited at the idea that I have something like mindfulness to keep practicing."

depression,fcm7p1k,t1_fcm7e1y,1577766412.0,"Well, you seem proactive about getting better which is great! Keep at it, even if that seems useless, it get better day by day if you try. I can tell you, you're not going to get better anytime sooner if you're not actively trying to, and you seem like you are so, that's great! I know how hopelessness feels and it seems never ending, have you seen someone like a counselor or therapist?"
