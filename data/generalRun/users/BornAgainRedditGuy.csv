baltimore,fffozd6,t3_etawn1,1579888659.0,"I think this is a no-brainer. Obviously Tough On Crime doesn't work. Obviously whatever the city is doing now doesn't work. And treating addicts like criminals and degenerates doesn't work, although there isn't any positive motivation behind that one. This isn't full on drug legalization, it's just a way to prevent overdose deaths. Dope fiends are going to shoot up either way, whether places like this exist or not. At least this way they can at least be safer, and I think things like this can serve as a pathway to recovery. Have some damn empathy, people."
mildlyinteresting,fffo92c,t3_etc3ao,1579888213.0,There's a lot of 12 year olds in this thread who still can't talk to girls in real life so they vent their frustrations online.
baltimore,fffnykg,t1_fffn88v,1579888039.0,He's not technically from Baltimore but he recorded Veteran while living here so we can probably claim him.

bipolar,fff6jv3,t3_et751j,1579876988.0,I pace around while planning out everything I'm going to say when I inevitably get invited to late night talk shows to talk about my life.
politics,fff5zfb,t1_fff3kfc,1579876575.0,And yet that Skynyrd lineup wouldn't have voted for Trump lmao. In that same song they literally booed George Wallace for being racist.
BipolarReddit,ffed8sz,t3_et4gdo,1579843783.0,"I didn't know you could have alcohol delivered haha. But good for you! I was at a point where I was drinking like half a bottle of bourbon every night. I saw the road I was going down so I put an end to it. 

You should consider it a win! It's the little victories for things like this. I've had some nights recently where I left my apartment to walk down to the liquor store but changed my mind and turned back, and I felt better as I was walking back to my apartment. I still wanted to be drinking, but I was happy that I decided not to."
wowthanksimcured,ffc8ik0,t3_estdig,1579793971.0,"I honestly convinced myself of this because after each depression I emerged from it inspired, productive, and euphoric. Then I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and realized I was just going to cycles of depression and hypomania and wasn't in control at all. 

So yeah."

thedavidpakmanshow,ffbzxu4,t3_est1k8,1579787951.0,"Basically, Bernie might be a democratic socialist himself but the policies he's proposing are standard social democratic policies. Which by definition is not socialism because it doesn't seek an end to capitalism, just imposes heavy regulations onto it."

bipolar,ff94c8n,t3_esbb33,1579704533.0,"Been sick but feeling slightly less exhausted today. A buddy of mine is coming into town this weekend and we are going to have a January BBQ because fuck the cold. Hopefully my next apartment will have an outdoor space for my grill so we can make this a tradition.

The new semester starts next week, and this time I'm starting out with less stress because I finally got my GPA to a 3.0! As a grad student my GPA has to be at least a 3.0. I almost lost my financial aid and by extension my health insurance. I wouldn't have been able to afford treatment without it. Last semester I was off and on having crazy episodes where I didn't feel human and thought I was like an evil spirit or something. During that time I was really struggling with alcohol as well and was becomming reliant on it. But I still managed to raise my GPA even though I had to put a few things off such as taking the PhD qualifying exam and starting my thesis. But this semester I'm going at a better pace for me, and I'm also applying for disability accommodations with the school because it's time for me to do so. 

I'm doing better now. I can drink without getting drunk and I don't have the compulsive need to do it every night anymore. I need to drink less but it isn't on the edge of controlling me anymore. I feel like I'm in a better place right now."

bipolar2,ff6px3r,t1_ff5yo8q,1579632419.0,Basically like it is now but with more energy. Like I'll pace around all night and wax poetic about how evil I am.
bipolar2,ff64l12,t3_erulku,1579618978.0,"I've recently decided to start being more selectively open with people about my struggles for this reason. Not to pour my heart out or anything, but I'm just telling friends and family that I'm bipolar. That way I can do my part to get people to associate bipolar disorder with people who more or less appear to have their shit together (I'm pretty stoic so people don't know what kind of darkness I live with lol). Eventually I want to start being open about it in general, but as for now I'm only telling people I'm close to that I can trust."
bipolar,ff5002s,t1_ff4zik2,1579576586.0,It's a kind of seed that you cook like rice. It's better for you than rice and makes a good substitute.

bipolar2,ff3x4u6,t3_erg33c,1579550776.0,"I never realize I'm in one until it's over. I guess it feels demonic in a way. For my last one I believed that at a spiritual level I was subhuman, in an evil sense. Not necessarily that I was a demon, but that I was a dark shell of a human with no soul. And because of all that, I didn't deserve basic human needs such as happiness and love. It lasted a long time, and each time I have an intense episode like that it changes me. I'm like a month or two out of it and I'm still recovering.

Without meds it would have been worse though, as I've learned through experience."

AskReddit,ff1yb31,t3_er424v,1579488974.0,"Baltimore:

\-Pros:  It's a great city with a lot of unique and fun things to do. The people are pretty genuine and non-pretentious.

\-Cons:  It gets a bad rap... Baltimore has it's problems, obviously, but all the people judging it from a safe distance like it's a war zone doesn't help anything and in fact does more harm than good. The people inside the city who hate most of the citizens for the same reasons don't help much either... The problems are all very real, but they are solvable. It's extremely hard to do, but it's possible. It's more than just ""Hurr durr rats and roaches lol The Wire lolol""

But yeah, I love Baltimore."
