YouShouldKnow,fcu3u47,t3_eiuejn,1577971816.0,If you want download a program call keepass. It stores all your passwords in one place secured by a password in itself to view. You can then auto generate passwords and store them there like a data base. I use it to autogenerated passwords that are 20 characters long that are just a random series of letters numbers and characters.
