Autobody,fcxxgbg,t1_fcxtpv7,1578071824.0,"It's fine to want to be interested in DIY. But body and paint is a bit of an art form and that area has compound curves and a style line. Will be tough for a first timer to get right and if you do, the blend on that area will be very noticeable if not done perfectly. Maybe practice on the truck and if you like the results you can try the MB."

As for the bumper, the zip-ties will take paint, but it won't stay on long. I would remove the zip-ties, paint and replace them. The contrasting color will add to the look you're going for."
