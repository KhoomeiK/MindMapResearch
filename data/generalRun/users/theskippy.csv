Total number of states won while seeking the Democratic nomination:  
Pete in his first ever  presidential campaign: 1  
Joe in his three combined presidential campaigns: 0"
Pete_Buttigieg,fgjiaso,t3_eymvup,1580844626.0,"I just heard that both the DNC and Pete's campaigns use the software Microsoft Windows.  Microsoft is owned by noted billionaire Bill Gates.  Could the corruption against the Bernie Sanders campaign be more obvious?

The individual reportedly drank 3 quarts of soy milk a day, which is approximately 1,400 calories. 

If you are drinking 1,400 calories, you are likely to develop excess weight.  I mention in my previous comment that an increase in weight is closely linked to an increase in estrogen."
soyboys,fggen59,t3_exn5e8,1580760269.0,"I'm also not an expert, take everything I am about to say with a grain of salt.  

Research is at best mixed about the consumption of soy and an increase in estrogen in humans.

A much more established correlation is the link between excess weight and estrogen.  On average, an increase in BMI leads to a 2% decrease in testosterone in males.

Eating soy, like everything, is fine in moderation.  Unfortunately, because of crop subsidies, we grow way more soy in the U.S.  than we need.  This has made highly processed soy to be a common filler in junk food.  The increased consumption of junk food is a contributing factor to the rise of obesity in the U.S., which directly raises our estrogen levels.

In short, eat all the edamame you want, but limit processed soy and process foods to help maintain a healthy weight."

Now that I am ready to donate, I'm not seeing it :)"
fatlogic,ff93pa1,t1_ff8nyf8,1579704087.0,I keep some oatmeal and peanut butter at my desk.  I will also bring a bag of fruit and meal prep some rice and beans for the week.  I do better if I have my preplanned foods as my closest option.
Pete_Buttigieg,fektcdl,t1_fek3u15,1579207183.0,I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.  I am focusing my efforts on texting/calling for Pete.
fatlogic,fdwvgs0,t1_fdws0ks,1578762729.0,Screw those people.  Show them an article how excess weight is significantly worse for joints than running.
fatlogic,fdobknt,t3_embfp2,1578602218.0,"I've never seen a full Lizzo show, and likely never will.

But based on her MTV performance, people may be overestimating her physical levels. 

In a 3 minute 45 second performance I tallied 65 steps, 37 jumps, and 6 seconds of twerking.  That's not even a decent warmup."
Pete_Buttigieg,fdfirfs,t1_fdfhxaa,1578362665.0,No thank you. Gov Walz is doing a bang up job.
fatlogic,fddpyqt,t3_eks3ma,1578320836.0,"Becky, Linda, Karen, and now Susan.  Crazy how common female names are now generic insults.  So empowering..."
