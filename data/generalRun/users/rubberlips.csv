homeowners,fekav56,t1_fejxpe4,1579196209.0,I second this. I would have your agent communicate to the listing agent that the home needs to be clear of all furniture.
AmItheAsshole,fejwtwq,t3_epirbk,1579187669.0,YTA for pressuring her and I hope she knows that she deserves better and leaves you soon.

aww,fe438qc,t1_fe4351h,1578855358.0,All the better to nibble on his parents' fingers with!
aww,fe42bbx,t1_fe41uep,1578855045.0,Thank you! His cute face makes up for how long it's taking for him to get potty trained.
AmItheAsshole,fd9r0fj,t3_ekc023,1578236953.0,"NTA. She is asking for too much. As someone who works in Philly real estate, I know that many apartments, without the cost of utilities factored in, are more than a mortgage payment each month.

Thank you for making me appreciate the sanity of my own MIL by sharing this!"

RealEstate,fcawcpi,t3_egxwgl,1577577908.0,"Both agents should have had better communication with each other and their clients, but don't make the seller lose an extra $5,000 when they already agreed upon a $5,000 credit on top of already negotiating the sales price.

Also, if that extra $5,000 makes you potentially walk (and you have a contingency in your AOS that allows you to do so without forfeiting your earnest money deposit (which on a $500k home is likely more than that amount)), I'm sure that there are plenty of other homes within your price range."
RealEstate,fbguoj7,t3_eda677,1576858997.0,"Title delayed our settlement for our home, so I negotiated having us lay prorated rent of $500/month and that we would start our own electric account a week before settlement, along with giving a $500 deposit. Fortunately the house was vacant and the executors of the estate were cool. A week later, we owned our home and going home that night felt a million times better than the previous night."
