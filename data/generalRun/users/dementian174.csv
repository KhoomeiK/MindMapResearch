NoStupidQuestions,feomqrq,t1_feok90b,1579302315.0,"This is really interesting. I think most commercial airliners fly at around 30,000-40,000 feet, so there's really no way you could hurt one of them with a gunshot. But a gunshot brushing the bottom of the plane would probably get caught in the slip stream, wouldn't it... so i should imagine it's almost impossible to hurt a commercial airliner when shooting a bullet from the ground unless you've somehow jumped the fence on an airport tarmac and have managed to up under a flight only to shoot at it.

There is a simple calm that's found in imagining that everything happens for a reason. That maybe it simply wasn't time. But I don't know if you're religious/spiritual or not so I won't go there. I will say that I am truly sorry, and that your baby was very lucky to be yours. For a while, it had you, and it was loved by you. There are many babies who aren't even that lucky. As for your mother, we all know that it has to happen. We don't want it to happen (god only knows Im terrified of it myself) but there's no escaping it. Your mother had so many years of happiness with you as her daughter. Try and take some comfort in knowing that you made her life better. Both her, and your child.
