AskReddit,ffb5g4q,t1_ff98ssj,1579752290.0,"Most airports have that. It's like a flat $20 fee. I got so mad when I flew out of Detroit and found out that only the terminal I happened to be in lacked the airport mailer service, so I lost a perfectly good Leatherman because of it. I mean, the thing only cost $20 to begin with, but it was really more about the principle. 
  
In hindsight, I realized I probably could have brought it to lost and found and pretended I had found it, they probably would have hung onto it for a month or so.
  
Edit: Turns out it's not as common as I thought, it was just a coincidence that every airport I've ever flown out of has had one. [Here](http://www.airportmailers.com/airportlist.php) is the complete list for the US, if you're curious."

changemyview,ff9ozxt,t1_ff6rxgn,1579717662.0,"Yes, both are valid. But one definition doesn't compute within the scope of the discussion you want to have. You asked about the meaning of non-binary gender identity; given a lay definition, this term would hold no meaning (as you argue). But given a different definition, one that is gaining viability in some discursive circles, the term does have meaning. In order to understand the term, you have to abide by the appropriate definitions of its component parts. Operating under conflicting definitions of a word is not ""freedom of discussion"", it's just confusion, just like you can't play baseball using cricket rules. Nobody is imposing a definition--language doesn't work that way. Definitions of words are arrived at by consensus through a variety of factors, including common usage and social pressure. The word ""gender"" has acquired a new, more specific definition in social sciences, and the circle of discourse that abides by this definition is expanding. You can choose to pretend it doesn't exist, but you will be perpetually confused when you run into people who use the term in this new way. You are welcome to insist on an alternative definition, just as I continue to distinguish between ""cell phones"" and ""smart phones"", but you have to recognize that doing so will create instances of confusion and miscommunication. 
  
There's no reason to be needlessly pedantic about definitions; it is enough simply to recognize the definition that is use in a particular context and abide by it. This is the essence of good-faith participation."
changemyview,ff6cr7o,t1_ff5uixm,1579624360.0,"Robert Sapolsky has a lecture series that includes some information about the biological basis of gender identity. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOY3QH_jOtE) is one video, where he talks about the brains of gay men about an hour in and turns to transsexuals at 1:25:00. [In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95OP9rSjxzw&t=3832s) he goes on to discuss the hormonal basis for androgynization from about 0:50:00 on.  It might be a bit difficult to understand without some of the information from prior videos. In general, I highly recommend this lecture series."
changemyview,ff6cbib,t1_ff5po47,1579624084.0,"The issue is that there isn't a positive description of what non-binary people are. If you asked me, ""are you French or Spanish"", assuming that I must be either French or Spanish, I would be forced to tell you that I don't fit in a meaningful way within that binary. Luckily, there does exist a word that describes what I am: I can say, ""no, I'm American."" But you might come back at me and say ""I know what Spanish people do, and I know what French people do, but I don't know what American people do. Your identification is not helpful or useful to me."" How should I respond? Should I just say, ""oh sorry, I guess I'm actually trans-French""? If, for some reason, the word American didn't exist, the most helpful thing I could do for you would be to inform you that I am neither French nor Spanish. At that point, you might inquire further to try to understand where I come from, or you might simply decide to leave the conversation at that. Either way, I haven't misinformed you as to the nature of my nationality--I'm simply limited by our shared lexicon to negative descriptions."
changemyview,ff69ld1,t1_ff47cmy,1579622335.0,"The issue you're confronting is an epistemological one. How do we decide what words mean, and what knowledge is ""real""? Do academic papers get the last word, or common usage? How do we reconcile differing conceptions of similar ideas across different cultures, such as the various views of ""gender"" listed in the above post? Should we even be using the same word to describe these things that differ in such significant ways? Similar issues come up with words like ""job"", ""music"", ""religion"", and ""family"". 
  
While this fundamental issue is subject to ongoing debate in epistemological and philosophical circles, perhaps the simplest answer is to look at the context in which a word is used. Your question pertained to gender-fluidity and other so-called ""neo-gender identities"". People who describe themselves as ""gender-fluid"", ""transgender"", or otherwise ""non-cisgendered"" are using the word ""gender"" to mean a particular thing, the same definition used in contemporary academic papers in most fields. Asking a question about a particular usage while ignoring the semantic basis for that usage and imposing a lay definition is intellectually disingenuous. It would be like asking how there can be more than one chemical variety of salt while insisting that the word refers only to sodium chloride, rather than [""a solid chemical compound consisting of an ionic assembly of cations and anions""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(chemistry))."

AskReddit,fdivudo,t1_fdijszj,1578452194.0,"Not every government institution is abysmal. The American military is apparently very good at killing people, the post office is incredibly reliable considering the volume and speed at which they operate, and most elections and censuses seem to go pretty smoothly. What's more, we can find instances in other countries of all kinds of services, including health care and transit, running very well in contrast to the way they are handled in the US. So the fact of a given institution being state-run does not inherently make it inefficient, corrupt, or incompetent, despite the example set by the VA. Appropriate funding is a big indicator of success; in the United States (and many other countries, I'm sure), the political forces interested in expanding private industry have consistently lobbied to restrict and defund public options ([example](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-04-04/congress-not-amazon-messed-up-the-u-s-postal-service)). 
  
A lot of the potential problems with universal healthcare stem from trying to form a publicly-funded health *insurance* corporation, imitating the model of private companies minus the profit motive. This is basically what Obamacare does (as I understand it). A better solution would be to integrate public funding throughout the process, so you are dealing directly with hospitals instead of through unnecessary third parties. Of course, then you have to reconsider for-profit hospitals (not a bad idea in my opinion), and next thing you know you're revamping the whole system."
