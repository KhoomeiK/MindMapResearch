Foodforthought,ffs1g48,t1_ffs1ed9,1580170811.0,You have a citation that proves me right and you aren't getting a new one until you address the current one. Address it or leave. You just agree with it if you want a new one.
Foodforthought,ffs17u6,t1_ffs0jrj,1580170654.0,I'll tell you for a 3rd time. Acknowledge that millenials overwhelmingly support universal healthcare as shown by a source then you will get that. Only when you do this. If you cant do this you get nothing other than a reminder of these terms. There is no compromise or exceptions to this. It's take it or leave it.
Foodforthought,ffs0ngz,t1_ffs09mf,1580170266.0,"Then stop trying to relate to us. 

I feel no sympathy for your past easy situation. We both live in the present and things suck. Like I said we can work together but you need to respect how we feel and stop demanding we do things. Older people keep telling us what to do and then getting pissed off when we don't obey them. They fail to realize this is intentional. You want to come join us in our collaborative process pretty much everyone is welcome. We are pretty inclusive but we are about respect and not invalidating people. If you wont cooperate we will exclude you and work around you or against you."
Foodforthought,ffs06xu,t1_ffrzthr,1580169946.0,"Then you should have no issue admitting millenials overwhemingly support universal healthcare. Just acknowledge and tell me you agree with the source provided. 

You are not getting anything else until you do this. If you don't disagree with my source there is no issue here."
Foodforthought,ffrzp97,t1_ffrrmxy,1580169612.0,"Lol dude gen x had the 90s. You are bunk. Nobody thinks you had it tough. You can feel this way but you had it easy compared to us and you aren't convincing millenials otherwise. Deal with it. We can still work together but we think what we think.

What we are doing is telling you what we believe. If you want to argue against it you are part of the problem.we aren't some pawn for you to use and we don't care about your opinion on us. If you want to work with us then stfu and accept how we feel. If not then expect nothing from us. Youll get nothing but problems. Keep bitching about us we will just give you more to bitch about.

Your opinion and advice is not appreciated or wanted and is a template for what we arent going to do."
Foodforthought,ffrzjho,t1_ffrwjbs,1580169502.0,"Medicare isnt universal healthcare. It is healthcare largely given to old people now that likely won't be around in the future. 

You are now asking for a source on something else. First you wanted a source on millenials and the young supporting universal healthcare. I provided one and you can't refute it but you are silent. 

Acknowledge that I proved millenials and younger vastly support universal healthcare and ill give you and source showing boomers are against universal healthcare. If you can't acknowledge the source I just provided and won't refute it with actual evidence then you are not getting anything else."
Foodforthought,ffrmohh,t1_ffrk6d5,1580161216.0,"Gen x accusing others of not doing anything... 


I mean i don't disagree with you that younger people need to vote more but don't act like your generation is any better. There is a reason gen x is considered a slacker and do nothing generation and it's not because it was of its small size, but it's apathetic attitude. 

Also millenials haven't been voting because no candidate really motivates them. Obama did the first time and then did nothing for them. Sanders motivates them but you saw what happened. At every oppertunity those in power disfranchised younger voters. Republicans are even trying to implement minority rule precisely because they can barely get the support of anyone under 45."

Foodforthought,ffrjc6y,t1_ffrabko,1580159189.0,"Millenials haven't been changing their views as they have gotten older. The easy days are over and people arent drinking the koolaid the last few generations drank.

What is different is millenials and gen z have actual empathy. They don't foolishly believe most people will be better off if everyone acts greedy."
Foodforthought,ffrj8rg,t1_ffr2hdz,1580159130.0,Boomers aren't voting for politicians to give universal healthcare usually the opposite. So either way I don't see why this should be ignored.
Foodforthought,ffrj5up,t1_ffrcpuq,1580159080.0,"Your statistics prove my point. It isn't millenials doing it, a small % do and the majority do not. The vast majority are against these boomet policies as shown by pew and a small minority growing to a slightly bigger small minority doesn't change this..."
Foodforthought,ffr06oh,t1_ffqzi88,1580147568.0,"It kidna is though. Who votes in politicians that let this happen and stops change? Who was the group that gave us Obama care which was better than nothing but still terrible and often even resisted that? Who are the people who enjoy government funded healthcare while denying it to others? I'll tell you it isn't the young. They are all for it and dont give a Fuck about the market.

You can blame corporations bribing politicians but there are people who run these companies, elect politicians, and don't hold them accountable. And have done so for decades."
Foodforthought,ffqyj8n,t1_ffqvh77,1580146519.0,"Why? They got theirs screw you. It's just common greed and apathy. 

I don't agree with it but it isn't mind blowing. It's just people at their worst. Older American generations are really entitled and selfish."
TrueReddit,ffnjxn0,t1_ffi50ao,1580066951.0,They want a dark *enlightenment* which is just do undo the actual enlightenment. And it is strange because the enlightenment was the event that took Europe out of filthy misery and allowed it to thrive.

Showerthoughts,fenkiea,t1_fenfwgw,1579286640.0,"Japan used to have serious issues with alcoholism because it was expected you would drink with co-workers after work. Its less prevalent today but required in the past. 

I know bosses and they often sleep in their office because they have to to out and drink with co-workers and make sure everyone is attending.

This allergy you speak of usually means they just get drunk faster and turn red. It doesn't stop most people from drinking."
Showerthoughts,fenfo86,t3_eq3r5b,1579283678.0,"Yeah that or because they work very pong hours, Japan is expensive, they are pressed for time and stressed without a baby, and the culture is pretty sexist and places a lot of the work on women who often need to work a job in addition. It is probably the alcohol."
TrueReddit,fenagqb,t1_fdrx2b5,1579280484.0,"Trump run the rust belt due to a lack of enthusiasm for clinton. White working class voters who had economic worries actually tended to vote for Clinton despite hating her. White voters who put cultural/social/or racial anxieties first voted for trump. The whole economic anxiety claim has been disprove time and time again. 

https://theintercept.com/2018/09/18/2016-election-race-class-trump/

The white working class in the rust belt also voted for Reagan who is the reason the manufacturing belt became the rust belt. Strong unions, union ties to politicians and other unions, and regulation allowed the white working class to prosper. The gop has always been opposed to these things. Trump too. His own base and voters are often hit the hardest by his stupidity. 

As for how do you target people who don't vote for you because they are racist,xenophobic, or bigoted in some form? You don't anymore. They are a minority and will turn more people off then they bring on. The issue is You have to appeal to people who aren't prejudiced. Not being a racist and calling out a racist like trump is not enough to motivate people to support you. After 4 years of trump and his nonstop failures yeah maybe you could run a cat and have it globber him , but that takes time to build up. Deny trump voters the power to inflict suffering on others like they want. Then don't help them unless they agree to stop trying to dominate every one else. They then can either thrive as equals or die in hateful resentful despair."
TrueReddit,femzyef,t1_felwg06,1579273859.0,The gop platform is to make all of the US like Mississippi.
TrueReddit,fdrkfzm,t1_fdqzqp6,1578685717.0,"Trump supporters aren't pushed around. They have mostly lost their ability to push others around without consequences and are resentful about. Thete is a white culture in the US that feels entitled and priviledged to exert its dominance over others. It isn't all white people. And this group has largely been losing its power. And other people just aren't going to forget this never happened. They aren't even calling for revenge or any thing , just for some empathy at the damage they have caused and that triggers trump supporters.

Whether trump supporters like it or not their traditional hierarchies have collapsed and they aren't coming back.

Having people whitewash and rewrite history specifically not to mention the harm they were causing was a past privilege. Every one else got called out they didn't, in the past. Now they have equality and are treated the same and when they do something horrible people tell them. And They are so entitled this causes them to break down."
TrueReddit,fdo27l8,t1_fdo16ks,1578597535.0,"Yeah. 

A lot of what divides us is manufactured. Racism, bigotry, homophobia, etc. 

What most people want is the same among all people and cooperation benefits almost everyone. 

Make no mistake the reactionaries don't want dissolution the crazy 3rd needs the 2/3rds. You can't really escape them."
TrueReddit,fdnztme,t1_fdnc1pm,1578596197.0,"A lot of it is value. How much is being made, how much you make, and how far employers will go to keep you happy. 

In the 1950s workers had high value. In 2020 most workers don't have high value. They are expendable and can be easily replaced and they must bend over backwards to appease their masters and not cause any trouble or they will be replaced. Thrown to the wolves of poverty."
TrueReddit,fdnzjaf,t1_fdne0cz,1578596029.0,"A big part of it is the emphasis we put into work and jobs. 

In other places work is seen as a nessecary evil not something to base your life on. Due to automation the value of most workers has dramatically dropped and they are aware of this."
TrueReddit,fdnzekk,t1_fdnkv5z,1578595953.0,"I think the last issue is the biggest part. In American culture identity is way too tied to work and wealth. And previously respectable , well paying, and stable jobs have become looked down upon, low paying, and unstable. On top of this lack of a social safety net. Then our political system is polazarized and can't fix this."
TrueReddit,fdnyw6z,t1_fdnoujg,1578595656.0,"It isnt really the politics but the economic situation. The political system is unable to cope with the economic problems we have. A small minority is able to prevent anyone from improving things by tricking other people. 

Really it's only going to get better when people realize the current system is unsustainable and we work together to fix the problems."
TrueReddit,fdnymqa,t1_fdny6z5,1578595504.0,"I largely agree with this but it does deeper. White culture in the US has often linked financial success to validation. The white working and middle class saw a lot of this and in addition to increasingly getting a better economic situation could feel good about themselves and their lives.  This was never true for most black people. 

Market oriented policy largely passed by the American right have destroyed these groups economically. They are upset they are in a bad financial situation but they also feel bad about themselves because they see themselves as failures per their past culture. They are basically in the same situation that black people are in in the past. Looked down upon by the wlite and society as a whole.

American society has always placed value on wealth and financial security. If You have it great but when you don't you are the dreaded other. 

Trump offers a easy scapegoat. The traditional victims of racist; nonwhites, gays, Jews, etc."
Showerthoughts,fcv58hn,t1_fcuve1w,1577994907.0,"It could be more or less than a grain. A grain varies in size and weight. You could split a grain into several grains. It could be a fraction of a grain or it could be over 1 grain and leas than 2 grains.

So really it's a dosage issue not a grain. Yes at some point the dosage becomes undesirable."
Showerthoughts,fcutv30,t3_ej1nn9,1577988380.0,Usually people apply much more than a grain at a time and it would be difficult to apply only a gram at a time. So the threshold is usually crossed by by more than a grain.
TrueReddit,fcojuxy,t1_fcodm4x,1577834052.0,"Cities aren't subsidized, they are where you pay market price. Usually suburbs and exurbs are subsidized. 

Everywhere I've lived usually older houses are far better than newer houses which are built really cheaply and put up as quickly as possible. Nor are newer houses any cheaper especially close to the city. They may look nice but they lack strong bones and arent built to last. Cheap drywall, vinyl, and substandard Chinese products vs brick and dense wood. 

If You are willing to add significant time to your commute I suppose you can find cheaper. You are not only adding a lot of time to the commute though but removing yourself from tge amenities and the things that make a city desirable. The idea of having a large gaudy and cheaply built mcmansion far removed from any thing is rather unappealing when you are a social person with an actual life."
TrueReddit,fcodiha,t3_ei9hu4,1577829586.0,As Republicans become unable to compete in fair elections their emerging strategy is to make it so you can only vote for them and if you are the type of person who will vote against them you won't be able to vote. It is like something out of jim crow.

This development is around a few urban areas. All the growth these days is around a few urban areas. It won't effect the supply chain. 

We are in the throes of a new farming crisis though. Corporate farms coupled with trump trashing free trade deals farmers need will mean a lot of noncorporate farms are going to go under."
