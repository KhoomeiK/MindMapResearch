There will always be a pool of unskilled workers, made up of high school kids, college kids, etc., and that‚Äôs good for businesses and those employees (and, indirectly, consumers) alike. The problem is that, when that pool grows too large, market forces drive wages down. Minimum wage tries to correct for that, and enforce a certain amount, which then encourages people to remain in the unskilled workers pool. The solution isn‚Äôt increasing minimum-wage, it‚Äôs helping people transition from unskilled to skilled labor, reducing the size of the unskilled labor pool, driving wages back up.

Now, that‚Äôs obviously much easier said than done, since it would involve massive revamps in our education systems, but it‚Äôs definitely a much better long-term solution than artificially buoying up wages."

Also, if you had been injured they probably would have been liable (hence why they should be furious about it), but the driver‚Äôs insurance would have had to pay for most of the damages and medical fallout. Though, admittedly I don‚Äôt know how Uber handles insurance.

My point is, I don‚Äôt think Uber was necessarily the villain here, so since you didn‚Äôt need the money (for medical bills or whatever) I think not suing them is the most ethical call."
