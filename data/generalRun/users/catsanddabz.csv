MacMiller,fem6fdn,t3_epwegy,1579241404.0,"Fucking mind blown. Despite already hearing parts of Hand Me Downs (as Guitar Case), Circles, Everybody, and Good News they all had new elements that the leaked versions never had. 

He left me mind blown, in tears, and looking at life in a new perspective. I canâ€™t wait to (try) to sleep and wake up to this beautiful album and experience it all again.

I just ordered my merch and Iâ€™m still shaking from this entire experience. Truly magical. Thank you Mac. Most dope forever.

MacMiller,fem5aai,t3_epw860,1579240250.0,I loved the unreleased version but something about how they completed it made it so much better. Itâ€™s been so interesting picking up on some of the subtle changes between the unreleased versions of the album and the official version. My favorite would have to be Hand Me Downs.

hempflowers,fdj3gl2,t1_fdizhat,1578457433.0,"Facts!!! I felt much better results from a 14% CBD strain i recently tried than the 18%. Same thing with THC too, Iâ€™m never really bother looking at the percentages anymore because i used to blindly pick whichever had the highest THC but Iâ€™ve learned that itâ€™s so much more than that"
hempflowers,fdj2vq6,t1_fdj11uq,1578457016.0,"One brand i tried was extremely dry flower that essentially cracked up between your fingers with any pressure. It was really disappointing because i felt like it didnâ€™t burn well and just didnâ€™t feel very fresh. 

Another was the same issue and the hemp was very stemmy. Itâ€™s what Iâ€™d imagine the â€œsmallsâ€ to be like but dried out and not marketed as that. 

Another actually was pretty decent but the customer service side of things was not good. I won a giveaway with them and they didnâ€™t reach out to me after i won and it took around 3 weeks of bugging the hell out of them for them to ship my prize. It was my third order with the company but the shady giveaway left a bad taste in my mouth. 

Last one i tried a preroll full of shake and it was pretty damn nice but it was $40 for an 1/8th so i just couldnâ€™t fathom the price. It was at a shop so i know that things were pretty taxed. 

Basically Iâ€™m just in the hunt for decently sticky bud, nothing crazy but i donâ€™t want to be able to completely crumble it between my fingers, ideally less than $100/oz, and feel like i can trust the vendor. Itâ€™s been quite the hunt but Iâ€™m keeping my hopes up! Hope some of this is useful!

Edit: Forgot to mention, the dry bud was also more brown than green so that really steered me away from it. It just seemed like it was a year old and they needed to get rid of it"
hempflowers,fdj0yy8,t1_fdiq6ya,1578455665.0,"Wow thanks for the info! The c5 smalls looks like something Iâ€™m definitely interested in. Iâ€™ve bought from about 4 different CBD brands in the past year trying to find some relief for my back and stay away from constant THC and as I have found the products effective, the brands have all had some unique problems that steered me away from future service. Iâ€™m still looking for a quality brand to trust in all of this so Iâ€™d be more than happy to give yâ€™all a try:) id love a new customer code to give yâ€™all a try because from what Iâ€™ve seen and read Iâ€™m really impressed and my budget has been a limiting factor!

Iâ€™m an anxious college kid with a fucked up back and CBD has helped me tremendously, the only downside is that Iâ€™m broke as fuck. I saw yâ€™all carry trim/shake on the website and Iâ€™m super interested because of the price but i mainly smoke it and i wasnâ€™t sure how well that would smoke? I usually prefer shake because itâ€™s less effort and you can load it on a bowl but the trim side of things worries me. How would you recommend smoking the trim/shake?"
therapy,fdgxdf4,t1_fdgx21y,1578410660.0,"I think you should tell him! In my experience the more transparent Iâ€™ve been about everything, the better! Itâ€™s so much easier than having to tiptoe around. Iâ€™d let him know why youâ€™re using them (self exploration or whatever the purpose may be) and tell him youâ€™re excited to talk about what you learn and discover with him afterwards.

Iâ€™m debating a big move and i really want to take shrooms when i feel like Iâ€™m mentally strong enough to decide what is best for me but Iâ€™m worried sheâ€™s going to not be in support of it. I really believe in the power of psychedelics, more specifically shrooms and DMT but i donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll do DMT until at least 10+ years but i donâ€™t want her to think Iâ€™m crazy for how interested i am in all of this.

One NM quite literally would pull out her cash tips from her waitress job at the end up the night and say â€œthis is all i got tonight, sorryâ€ while her drunk husband would comment on my appearance but i decided it was time to re-evaluate and find a family that will treat me right. One family also up and moved during spring break and when i showed up the following Monday and saw the â€œfor saleâ€ sign i cried for quite a long time. That being said, good jobs are out there but it takes some fishing around to find. I really wish you the best of luck in this journey. Finding the right match feels so amazing and shows you how fun and rewarding nannying can be!

Last question, how often is there actually snow on the ground? Are the winter months always full of snowfall or do you catch breaks every once and a while? Sorry if that seems like a dumb question but Iâ€™ve never experienced a true 4 seasons up here and Iâ€™m sure you can relate"

I unrolled the preroll and hit it out of a bowl to examine the flower quality and it was really nice! Iâ€™ve tried lots of flower and they tend to be pretty dry but this bud was sticky! It smelt a little loud and usually the hemp tends to smell a bit fruity so the smell really turned me onto the product too!
Tucson,fdabtqx,t1_fdablk6,1578244286.0,Awesome Iâ€™ll look into that! I was told that North of speedway is great but south of there is where things can get sketchy
Tucson,fdaal3n,t1_fda73xw,1578243736.0,"Cool! Thank you! Iâ€™ve always wanted to visit Portland but the cold turns me away so thatâ€™s cool to hear that Tucson has that weird vibe. I work for the extreme wealthy and Iâ€™m trying to avoid that materialistic mindset that Iâ€™ve had to surround myself with lately so maybe the north side might not be for me. 

Do you have any recommendations for a more laid back and safe feeling without all the pretentiousness it sounds like youâ€™re describing from north Tucson. I want somewhere easy access to nature and Oro Valley seems really cool to me but i know that nowhere is perfect and people like you can provide the real shit for me that you canâ€™t find by google! 

Thanks again!"
Tucson,fda9xs1,t1_fda89la,1578243458.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for, thanks for the truth! Iâ€™ve looked at the apartment market in north Tucson and itâ€™s still significantly cheaper than anything i could get in the area i live in right now. Iâ€™ve scanned the subreddit and it looks like some of the nicer apartments in north Tucson are doable for me. I really just need to take a visit out there and see what Tucson is about. 

Personally i identify myself in the middle and donâ€™t like picking sides but Iâ€™m tired or how divided things are around here. If you donâ€™t like guns people automatically assume youâ€™re liberal and try to debate you otherwise. Iâ€™m not looking for a city where everyone is over the top liberal, just a little more open minded. I hate even having to use politics to try to get across what Iâ€™m trying to say but the area i live in are all die hard for their parties and no one can change it. Thanks for being so honest about everything!"
