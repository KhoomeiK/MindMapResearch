Also another way that seens to lead it but blocked  is blocked by acid water.

Find out what makes you happy . What are you good at that you can make a living off. Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years and is it realistic? Where DON'T you wanna be in the next 5 years. These are things you should think about Gotta be real with yourself. Also going to college without a plan or feeling it's just something everyone expects you to do as a norm or to please others is something I do not recommend. That's how you set yourself off from lots of sadness and confusion. I've seen it in myself and in my ex gf

School is always gonna be there for ya . Don't rush it. Enjoy your life and find your own personal peace and happiness."

Just remember fall out 76 and anthem came out recently and anthem was dead on launch and fallout 76 is a dumpster fire that keeps charging you money for a more comfortable and ""premium"" dumpsters fire to enjoy

U1 is artistically a much better piece of work then those ""modern"" games ."
PS4Deals,fcthl8m,t1_fcsvc38,1577943534.0,"1 uncharted one is not bad by today's standards. Remember, anthem and fallout 76 released recently and anthem wasn't even fully cooked before it was out the door and we all know how much of a fucking dumpster fire those games are 

At least uncharted 1 is a complete fucking game. Good visuals for even today's standard.  Collectables, good voice acting. Boxed controls but by no means frustrating or unplayable. Still very enjoyable. It's still a good game"
PS4Deals,fcthdzz,t1_fctarw0,1577943342.0,Wow I guess sullys and Nathan's relationship didn't mean jack shit to ya. And why it was so satisfying to see Nathan to be the cautious one and actually listening to Sully near the end of 4 about stopping his reckless brother  from doing something stupid. It was a nice role reversal that I really liked. Nathan's maturity really comes out in 4
