I didn't return at all, they got out of their car and stood on either side of mine trying to box me in as they are kicking my windows and door handles, trying to break into my car any way they possibly can. You say I'm committing assault by trying to leave? **They were moving around my car trying to prevent me from leaving** until I made it clear, I **will** hit you, hard. 

Only when I quickly whipped it into reverse, turned, and slammed my car into him knocking him down hard did they both quickly stop what they were doing and decide to leave.

I froze in panic for a moment before realizing I was driving a weapon;

 I put it in reverse, turned the wheel, and quickly slammed  one of them with my hood. They quickly got in their car and left. I followed them (stupidly), but I did get a photo of their license. Police did nothing about it, didn't even bother to reach out to the owner of the car. Shocker.

 Then tons of other customers started messaging me saying the same exact thing was happening to them. The product I received was unevenly dosed and mislabeled. It also took 3-4 weeks to actually reach my door, even though I live in the same STATE as Bongo. Ridiculous. Why did it take this person almost a month to get to a post office?

 causing the caboose to swing to the side before colliding with a concrete slab and derailing upon impact.[35][36] **During the ensuing commotion, the erring brakeman, presumably to avoid disciplinary action, quietly left the scene of the accident, exited the park, and was not seen again.**
