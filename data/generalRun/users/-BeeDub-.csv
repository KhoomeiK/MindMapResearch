Two more points on isos. 

1) They added shit qualities like ""Increased damage with weapons found in the level"". Thats a purple quality that now competes with the coveted ""Increase Damage by 16%"". They did this for every color therefore every rainbow and it makes it even worse getting good rainbow combos now.

2) They nerfed many qualities but they grandfathered existing ones as long as you don't upgrade them. Read: Upgrade your best rainbows to AA +5 before updating. I can't tell you exactly which ones were neutered, its too late for me I didn't know this."
MAU3,fcse9an,t1_fcrzs82,1577915302.0,"Exactly. If it does the former it is not helpful for the sought after attributes and arguably should only be used for upgrade fodder (class As and dust). If it does the latter, its HUGE for getting the better attributes.

How can we figure it out though?"
MAU3,fcrt0x9,t1_fcr8o5w,1577906224.0,"See I wish they'd have some media presence so we'd know. I disagree that rank up does that because my experience and the text itself defies giving more of the AA effects. It takes a C and makes it a B, it doesn't change the effect. I use them to make more white/rainbow dust.

But really, what does any of us know? We're all just squirrels trying to find a nut.

I appreciate everyone trying help us make more sense of the drops."
MAU3,fcr77yw,t3_eijsx9,1577897777.0,"Comparing 100-150 vs 150-200: you need half the exp to from 150-200 than you did to get from 100-150.

When I leveled up the new characters I would get about 5 levels per 48 Rush in the 100-150 range. I was getting about 10 levels per round after they hit 150.

I'm glad they did that and I wish they'd make it retroactive for all of the leveling."
retrogaming,fcr12w5,t3_eicslv,1577895201.0,"Alien vs Predator because it is a great game.

Kasumi Ninja because it is sooo bad it's hilarious. I especially enjoy the Scotsman that pisses fireballs."
MAU3,fcqwzxs,t3_eifhf6,1577893494.0,"Because iso-8s only apply to the character that gets the kill...

I don't apply them evenly. My main gets 4x rainbow find. The other 3 characters each get 2x rainbow, 1 rare, 1 higher class.

Synergies appear to make both characters count towards the kill. Ditto Extreme Attacks."
MAU3,fcqwm0f,t1_fcq2n4w,1577893329.0,"The problem with this assessment is I don't believe thats what Increases Rare does. Its hard to pin down because of the numbers but Rare appears to net better qualities like: Rainbow Find, Team Exp, Damage Increase %, etc.

Rare definitely does nothing for class or quantity of isos per round."
MAU3,fclkrg3,t1_fcl64pc,1577750081.0,"I've been around since XML. I put XML2 > MUA3 > XML > MUA2 > MUA

I have a different theory. Solo vs Co-op. You guys saying the combat sucks and MUA2 had better? I think we're playing different games? I like the Synergies more than Light/Heavy combos... though it would've been great to have both.

Best example I could give is Gambit MUA3 vs Gambit MUA2. He and so many others have crumby gameplay in MUA2.

I didn't downvote you because disagreements aren't supposed to collect downvotes."
MAU3,fcjsgk2,t1_fciwwhg,1577702394.0,"This is accurate. Using 16 team exp isos bla bla bla, I would gain ~5 levels per run from 100-150. I gained ~10 levels per run from 150-200."
MAU3,fcjsayg,t1_fcjb5ha,1577702160.0,"If you have 1 character at 160, you unlock delta.

Delta makes your characters 200 for the match."
nottheonion,fcfp1j2,t3_egzlhn,1577632356.0,"One thing not mentioned: cubs. Cubs are born mid-winter during hibernation. Bears wake up and tend to their newborns but being sedentary is an important part. Cubs are born tiny. Black bear cubs are less than a pound at birth and their hind legs are worthless at first.

There's no way a cub would survive a mobile mother."
MAU3,fcbknfe,t1_fcbiub4,1577587971.0,"I agree that it was a bad design choice to have item find and ditto the design choice on having to actively level everyone.

But that isn't going to change now. I'd rather have one or more end-game activities built on the game we got."
MAU3,fcb6c9l,t3_egwpzg,1577582936.0,"No. Its designed to be an end-game activity.

If we got exp, people would wear Team EXP isos possibly exploiting getting full health/energy several times per round.

If there were Iso drops, people would wear Iso find, crippling their own team.

After the tiers are over, it remains a great way to earn Shield tokens.

We have Rifts for Exp and Iso-8s."
MAU3,fc54ktx,t3_eg2dnm,1577442837.0,"We have Wasp without Antman, very weird.
Vision, War Machine, and Winter Soldier - I initially expected these 4 to be a DLC.

I'm not saying I want them but saying I'm surprised we didn't get all of the MCU Avengers."
MAU3,fc54bgz,t1_fc41h6w,1577442452.0,"You can't directly do this. If you host, you can't start a match until you have 5 people. You can stack the deck 4 humans vs 1 human 3 coms; which screws over that 5th person because they will 99% lose.

If the 5th person leaves the match you will get 4 humans vs 4 coms and still get your online rewards.

There are so few people online, its a crappy thing to do.

If its taking awhile to fill I room, I go with 6 people each having 1 com so its fair."
MAU3,fc53wgg,t3_eg4nbg,1577441822.0,"Delta is the highest rank. Offline you get 5 points for winning, 0 points for losing. Online you get 10 points for a win, 5 points for a loss.

Only the final mission counts so if you won all 3 rounds but lose to Dark Phoenix, you lost the whole thing.

Gamma awards 3/0 points offline or 6/3 points online. Etc.

After learning this, the decision was easy for me."
MAU3,fc53f3p,t3_eg8y6g,1577441112.0,"Its a bug. They don't exist on any menu. After you do this, if you replace any of them with bought/earned voices you can't get them back.

Only way to get one back is to scrub them all by going with the defaults again."
MAU3,fc4fjeh,t3_efyysd,1577415190.0,"The ""...interrupt by a ton"" is a must so the rainbow that has that and 16.5% damage is a given.

I also like the rainbow with HP Gain + HP Leech against Stunned

After that, Energy Damage and Energy Crit Rate.

I don't think Synergy is a good idea because his self explosions don't appear to count nor his heavy and jump attacks."
MAU3,fc2w2eo,t1_fc2id43,1577375572.0,Yes.
MAU3,fc1c7je,t3_efl1ps,1577314408.0,Did you pay $20 for the season pass? It doesn't look like it.
MAU3,fc14fin,t1_fc12se0,1577307964.0,I did after encountering this problem.
MAU3,fc0e6al,t3_ef8yzt,1577288380.0,Because its fun!!
MAU3,fbzo69z,t3_efanb2,1577253635.0,"Snag your favorite 4 and ride with them until you die. Early on, this game is hard and being under leveled really sucks. Even if you follow this advice you will still hit an occasional wall and have to level in a few Rifts to move forward again in the story.

You have to beat the story 3x to begin the end-game.

Don't upgrade any iso-8s until you hit the end game. Equip your best ones but upgrading is a waste of time until you're working with A or AA class gems.

If your favorite characters are on the DLC, get it. If you're happy with the huge base pool, wait and see if you like this game a lot before dropping the extra $20."
MAU3,fbzly55,t3_efbhzu,1577251212.0,I totally disagree. I'm 21/30 Danger Room with him.
MAU3,fbz7r25,t3_ef8myg,1577237720.0,"If you do PvE, you lose the whole thing on your first loss.

I had the same thing happen to me and never PvE again.

In PvP its weighted/fair. If you win Delta you go up 2 tiers; if you lose you still gain 1."
