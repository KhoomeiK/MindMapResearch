travel,ffgcbq1,t3_etglfg,1579903088.0,"First tip: Purchase and download the app [Just Ahead](https://www.justahead.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAyKrxBRDHARIsAKCzn8wtOL4672iPVsTou7hv1Yl4gUis82WSLdBSg3We2QEB2OeHu9uyqFkaAvTLEALw_wcB). It uses GPS to tell you about the parks as you drive through.

I'd flip your park itinerary to start at Grand Teton, then go to Yellowstone, then Glacier. Makes it a nice line north instead of the back and forth. I recommend staying at a cabin at [Colter Bay Village](https://www.gtlc.com/lodges/colter-bay-village). Two nights will give you an okay amount of time to explore the park.

Yellowstone is large but it's not too much when you break it up. I'd stay your first night at [Canyon Lodge and Cabins](https://www.usparklodging.com/yellowstone/canyon_lodge.php?gclid=Cj0KCQiAyKrxBRDHARIsAKCzn8w3ITeP0euPLQJ0y8H7rDQFwnD2b0nXMNoNtIthmmEEyPfhyyABsaEaAilsEALw_wcB) and your second night at the [Old Faithful Lodge](https://www.usparklodging.com/yellowstone/old_faithful.php?gclid=Cj0KCQiAyKrxBRDHARIsAKCzn8x1mtrto5vlEepxz9jTegfMd2XIHzgnmGK1uhS_2c60MPIFieaRumcaAp5UEALw_wcB). Or, do two nights at either and drive to destinations. Remember to allow for a lot of exploring time. Sometimes you sit and wait for a while for a geyser to erupt. All part of the fun.

You could get to Glacier from Yellowstone in a day, I've done it. Just leave nice and early and stay outside the park. The drive is very long and remote but pretty. You can always play road trip games and have fun with it.

I don't remember the name but once you're finally at Glacier NP there's this small motel on the highway outside the east entrance, to the north. It's affordable and cute because they have DVD players in the rooms and you check out your movie in the general store. 4 stars.

Second night at Glacier must be [Many Glacier Hotel](https://www.usparklodging.com/glacier/many.php?gclid=Cj0KCQiAyKrxBRDHARIsAKCzn8wJfmBW3O4xxYdaUOaAfKuFsvSZfIS6aBsozqkI1_s98qspPdIS92YaAh5zEALw_wcB). First of all, the hotel is incredible. Second, Many Glacier is possibly the most spectacular view I've ever seen. It's absolutely incredible. [Here's a photo I took while there](https://www.flickr.com/photos/milwaukeemark/37088846934/).

Most of the big views are on the east side of the park. Going to the Sun Road will take you all the way to the west end but it's not as dramatic over there. I'd spend the day exploring, then end the day in the town of West Glacier. There are a few simple lodging options here. Be careful to realize after West Glacier, it's remote again.


If you only pick one of my suggestions, pick Many Glacier. Have fun!"

wisconsin,ffealmy,t3_esxyzw,1579841363.0,"I know it's a different state with a different culture but Oregon (my state) decriminalized marijuana in 1973, legalized medical marijuana in 1998 and fully legalized marijuana in 2015. In the first full year of recreational taxes (2017), the state brought in $70.3 million. 2018 tax revenue was $82.2 million and 2019 $102 million. 

Schools gets the biggest share of cannabis revenue, 40 percent, followed by 20 percent to the state’s Mental Health, Alcoholism and Drug Services account, 15 percent to the State Police, 10 percent each to cities and counties for law enforcement and 5 percent to the Oregon Health Authority for alcohol and drug abuse prevention.

Reefer madness is keeping Wisconsin back. The tax revenue being generated by other states alone should be an eye opener to your state's legislature.  Also, it's weed. I mean COME ON people. The fact that you're only talking about medical marijuana is embarrassing. Oregon did that twenty-two years ago!"
food,ffe2o32,t1_ffe1xfm,1579835119.0,They're both powdered sugar. Caster sugar is powdered sugar and icing is made using powdered sugar. OP probably just changed words as they thought about the steps in their recipe.
memes,ffc03fi,t3_esri0u,1579788076.0,"A couple weeks ago my wife and I were seated next to each other on an airplane. We paid extra for the privilege with this airline. My wife dislikes flying so it's important for her to sit next to me and hold my hand when she needs it.

In comes a family of four. Two adults, two young (4-6) children. One kid sits next to us, Dad sits behind us and Mom and the youngest are across the aisle.

They didn't ask us directly but complained openly about being separated, upsetting the kids more than necessary. One even puked.

But you know what? Fuck those people. You didn't pay extra to sit together, you didn't plan properly and you sure as shit aren't taking my seat.

Then again, they didn't fit any of these categories so I'm not sure what I'm ranting about. I typed all this shit out though so I'm committed."

I live in University Park, closer to the city center than say Lents, Mt Tabor or Montavilla. Yet, my block gets cut. Let's not even get into the St John's Bridge being left out."

AskReddit,ferl2u1,t3_eqgep3,1579355298.0,"I'd turn my house into the neighbourhood scary house. All cladded up and unwelcoming as heck with weird submarine-style periscopes coming out the roof. The basement becomes our shelter. I'd have a greenhouse, solar power, crank radio, a way to get fresh water and I'd begrudgingly get a gun or two. I'd also figure out a waste disposal situation.

I'd stock up on entertainment, study every card game I can learn, download so many books, buy tons of art supplies and get board games. I'd also label them with future dates and reward myself in time with ""new"" surprises.

I would organise, reorganise and practice that life. Who knows how long I'd last but every day alive on this planet is a good day."
hiking,ferfffb,t1_feq89oo,1579353284.0,"Thanks! You're right to point out the danger. Ice cleats are pretty much required neat the base of Multnomah Falls. It's very slippy. Past the bridge, we dealt mainly with snow. Gaiters are what saved us here, along with snow pants. Snow depth was about 16"".

We also wore extra strippable layers, carried snacks and a lunch, had an emergency kit, compass, map (even though we didn't need it, you never know), plenty of water and charged phones.

Also, there is continued danger from falling trees and branches as well as tumbling rocks. We saw a lot of deadfall but it wasn't actively falling all around us. It's just good to be aware and alert."

hiking,ferdd47,t1_fepoitl,1579352608.0,"Thank you! 

The base of Multnomah Falls near the lodge and up the steps, all the way to Benson Bridge is ice because of foot traffic. Past that, it becomes more snow than ice. We were wearing ice cleats, gaiters and snow pants. After Weisendanger, we only had one pair of tracks to follow. Snow depth was around 16"". The climb to the trail's peak elevation was a slow slog but worth every effort. This trail, no matter how many times I hike it (this was my 5th), is incredible."
