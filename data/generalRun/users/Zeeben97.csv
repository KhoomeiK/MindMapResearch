This happened to me last year in Barcelona, I was with my 17yo brother in the bus he was visiting me and we were talking and laughing (we’re Moroccans btw). And we Moroccans can speak a lot of languages and we really master accents. So anyways we’re in the bus, talking arabic, french, english all at once and this fucking dumbass old ass lady turns around and says : “ustedes arabes desagreables callen la boca si pueden hablar todos estos idiomas que hablan espagnol”. Basically saying if you can speak all these languages, speak spanish then. 
Now I understood and spoke a little spanish at the time but I’m not gonna start arguing with this dumdum while everyone is starring at us in the bus. 
We just got off at the next stop."

For example, my brother was born in the United States (My mom was pregnant with him while she was there and was coming back to birth him in Morocco but they didn't let her board the plane). So he is American by right because he was born there, but he has no American culture at all whatsoever, but since he grew up in Morocco and both of his parents are North Africans what is he considered? African American? Moroccan? American Moroccan? Arab African? Arab American? Arab African American?

Second of all how is that cultural appropriation? There’s a reason for your kid to have that name and it’s beautiful reason, and I’m sure as he grows up he will be proud to have the name of his « grandfather ». Third of all, you are black, your wife’s black, her family is black, your kid is probably black too, how is a name neglecting his culture? Culture is about actions and attitude not about names or skin color."
