selfimprovement,feez2hv,t3_eoswxa,1579044375.0,"same here, i struggled with this till i found out that having angry or sad facial expressions at your normal state is a big sign that you are an introvert, they even called it ""resting bitch face"" anyway i stopped explaining this to people and became confident in my own skin, i began to  think that this facial feature is like a defense mechanism cause you know, introverts don't like to socialize that much so having this grumpy facial expression at your normal state is like a sign for other people that you're not inviting them to socialize with you..."

lawofattraction,fdsjhc2,t3_emlz77,1578703921.0,"first you state what you want by saying it out loud or writing it on a paper the yoy proceed by doing the following :
1-Visualization having what you want vividly 
2- raising your vibes throughout the day so you can strengthen your belief that X (what you want) is on its way
3-letting go, dnt get attached to a specific way or time at which the thing u want will manifest
4- last thing is to watch the unfolding of the manifestation process (that's the most exciting part)
and dont forget to be grateful"
