Maybe get them to document their refusal to re-test for MG? Why won’t people just do the test? It fucking science, you do the test to rule it out. Did you manage to get those diagnoses scrubbed from your record?"

We don’t know. If she consulted with the ex and pulled some resources, therapy once a month might have helped."
SubredditDrama,ff27hc3,t1_ff0kpri,1579496014.0,You know what. I had a good laugh about that until I realized that the geology/fossil store I like to go to is sourced and owned by a geologist who believes in the cleansing power stones.

It was gross. It was maddening. Make the kid wash the sheets. Then seek behavioral therapy. It should have been done years ago."

AskReddit,fevna46,t1_fesku6n,1579399270.0,"Okay. When I was a little, about 8 or 9, I had rosary that was pastel pink and green. I loved that rosary. I think i got after my first communion or there about a so I was full into that segment of my life. But I’d swear that that rosary had power to it. I mainly remember testing it with the weather. I could make it rain suddenly or stop it just with prayer. The main test though was I prayed for snow in June and got a lite dusting. I was so impressed. I was at church and as I was getting into our Aerostar, I dropped the rosary on the van floor as I was getting in. And I got out for a better vantage point but it was gone. Utterly gone. I tore through that van looking for it but I never saw mine again. I think I was unworthy of its power when I kept testing it. Even when we got rid of it years later, I checked it once last time. It had disappeared through the ether."

Right now, she isn’t your stepdaughter, she’s totally independent woman that sees an opportunity to control you. She will continually abuse her relationship with her father to manipulate you on small matters to big ones. She’s just showed her hand too early. 

Don’t give in. Neither you new husband and his daughter are entitled to that fund."

NTA, but don’t split it with your current husband because he just might give the money to *his* daughter."

Nobody wants communism, they want the socialist welfare programs that FDR brought with his New Deal to be insolvent. They want healthcare, dental, vision, women’s health, to be inclusive and not exorbitantly expensive that people gamble with their lives because INSURANCE COMPANIES want to pay their CEOs a nice bonus very 6 months to a year.
