CozyPlaces,ffdl7sn,t1_ffcui5p,1579823243.0,"Really? A friend and I wandered in on a random June evening and it was not that crowded at all.  Nobody was standing around to photograph this (as another comment suggests), that's for sure.  Just lucky?  It was far from empty but it certainly wasn't busy enough to kill the cozy feeling."
feedthebeast,ffcnhst,t1_ffchq37,1579803210.0,"AE2 is mandatory for this pack -- you'll need it everywhere, I can't imagine trying to do anything mid to late game without it.  I recommend automating production of all AE2 items before seriously getting into HV. So, you should def give this a detailed look."
feedthebeast,ffcn4kk,t1_ffahdxr,1579802982.0,"I put rare cities config on... but having said that, you kind of DO want the materials the buildings are made from.  Terracotta is a perfect source of aluminum before you get a full cobbleworks up."
feedthebeast,ffcmudd,t1_ffbs5qr,1579802810.0,"Came here to post this, hah"
gaming,ffaf3o7,t1_ff9rv40,1579734237.0,"Seriously. This was in two pieces of launch content and they immediately realized it was an awful idea going forward.  It was just plot integral enough as designed that there was no easy fix.  (And in their defense, when experienced as intended it makes for great storytelling)"
gaming,ffaeve2,t1_ffa241v,1579734057.0,Kingdom Hearts did this correctly and it's old enough to vote.  It shouldn't still be a problem!
PlayStationPlus,ff84e0w,t1_ff83n0f,1579665681.0,"I was being a little sarcastic, sorry. I've had PS+ since it launched on PS3 in the US in 2010 and in that entire time I think there have been two and they were PS1 Classics (FF5 and Arc the Lad) both of which were before PS4 launch.  I am not optimistic about us seeing another, let alone one that's not a remaster."
AskPhysics,ff82gjj,t1_ff7zk98,1579664236.0,"This really depends on your detector. For example, an MKID is very precise but technically is measuring energy.  Not that most people have those lying around, of course."
PlayStationPlus,ff828g2,t1_ff7wouc,1579664070.0,When was the last time they gave out a full AAA JRPG?
feedthebeast,ff6g0iw,t1_ff66814,1579626391.0,"A metric buttload of your players disagree, I think that's at least worth trying to understand"
feedthebeast,ff46zuz,t3_ercsoh,1579556914.0,I really wish this mod just added the ability to create arbitrary portals rather than having to do trickery with the nether for stuff like this.

astrophysics,ff1yq96,t1_ff1cd9l,1579489264.0,"I hope you're a freshman, because relativity should absolutely be handled in your undergrad general physics classes."
