AskReddit,fghaist,t1_fgg54k6,1580780478.0,I liked it tbh. No where near as good as the Del Toro films but i thought it was pretty decent
wholesomememes,fgbt7zl,t1_fgbse7a,1580665927.0,It's pretty prevalent on Reddit because people here absolutely loathe fame and wealth. Just because you have money doesn't make you a bad person. I wouldn't consider Bill Gates a bad person even if he didn't donate to charity. He worked hard for his business and wealth and he then donates a large amount of that money to charity and then Redditors have the audacity to say that he's not donating enough
cringe,fgbm2qu,t1_fgblawv,1580663589.0,It was pretty clear she kissed her on the mouth to gain publicity rather because she was lusting her/was attracted to her. The reporter obviously noticed the intention and didn't take it seriously. I'm not even disagreeing with you that it was wrong to kiss her asshole I'm just saying the Reporter looked like she obviously didn't care. Don't try to compare strangers online to rapists because you can't gauge facial expressions

cringe,fg9v3dw,t1_fg9svs8,1580643477.0,No she wasn't. She obviously found it funny by her facial expression and laughter pitch. Doesn't mean it was right to kiss her but she obviously didn't think it was a big deal and understood the non sexual intent

cringe,fg0twsm,t1_fg0rlcj,1580414941.0,"How about you actually educate yourself instead of spitting bullshit at me. Atomic Bombs fall under both Physics and Chemistry, and you are obviously less than equipped to talk about either. For your 'facts', they are just outright wrong. The Tokyo Bombings had killed around 100,000 while the Hiroshima Nuclear attack had killed around 90,000-146,000 and the Nagasaki had killed around 39,000-80,000. The Tokyo bombings lasted two days while Both Nuclear Attacks had devastated their cities almost instantly, leaving thousands more dying from radiation poisoning. And this was just two bombs. In Japanese minds it was far more effect for the Americans to spend a couple months conventionally bombing the country taking up multiple aircraft and resources while the Nuclear attacks allowed to vaporize two cities in a matter of no time. 

When Emepror Hirohito broadcasted his decision fpr Japan to surrender to the Country he even said; 
""The enemy now possesses a new and terrible weapon with the power to destroy many innocent lives and do incalculable damage. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization."""
cringe,fg0kk09,t1_fg0e4q5,1580409661.0,"That is interesting, thank you for replying. I do disagree though and even though the nuclear raid may not have been just about ending the war with Japan, it was obviously about sending a message to the russians as well. The emperor of Japan Hirohito actually broadcasted a message about Japan's Surrender that included;

""The enemy now possesses a new and terrible weapon with the power to destroy many innocent lives and do incalculable damage. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.""

That is pretty cut and clear to me that The creation and usage of the nuclear bomb had a clear impact on Japan that resulted in their surrender."
cringe,fg0junt,t1_fg0a6pj,1580409254.0,Lol mate you obviously do not know your history well and you also seem to have a weak grasp on chemistry as well since you don't seem to know what nuclear bombs are.
cringe,fg05heg,t1_ffzzxye,1580400646.0,Maybe you should go revise your history because creation of nuclear bomb and the using of them in Japan is 100% one of the main factors of ending WWII. The Conventional Bombings on Japan may have had higher casualties but that was because they took course over a few months.

You can't say objectively they're bad or mediocre movies, because objectively implies that there is no personal bias or opinion. You're of the opinion they are mediocre which makes them bad personally for you. I think it's fine that you don't love them but I'm pretty sure more people would say they're great than just mediocre"
