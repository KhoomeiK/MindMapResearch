I can tell you OP that my husband and I have been together for 18 years and we love each other just as much, if not more than our first year together. It really hurts my heart that so many people here struggle and stay miserable ""for the kids"" when all it's doing is teaching their kids that it's ok to be stuck in a terrible relationship. It's 100% not."

TinyHouses,ffsw1w8,t1_ffsv66d,1580194770.0,Idk but I wish they would. I live in a 5th wheel and if we didn't have a slide out it would be way too cramped in here. Maybe the weight is an issue when everything is made from solid wood instead of cheap wood and metal?
badwomensanatomy,ffsvz7r,t3_eute5r,1580194682.0,Oh jeez. Obviously these idiots that think any and all labia looks like this are probably virgins anyway or completely terrible in bed.

TinyHouses,ffs4eel,t1_ffrty0c,1580172855.0,Right? I love how fancy/pretty you can make tiny houses for a fraction of the price of building a whole house.
TinyHouses,ffs4895,t1_ffrdo9l,1580172734.0,"I live in a 5th wheel in a trailer park, if I want a tiny house I have to pay someone else to build it for me. I absolutely love living tiny and love tiny houses and all variations... Busses, trailers, tiny houses, tiny cabins, etc. Most people don't have the luxury of acquiring stuff for their build or somewhere to build it and then property to live on. Tiny living isn't just about saving money to build your tiny. Most people don't want to have to pay a mortgage or don't need a ton of space to live or want to travel in something that's sturdier than an RV or trailer. There are tons of reasons people go tiny and you shouldn't be judging anyone for any of those reasons."
TinyHouses,ffs2pwe,t1_ffqwci2,1580171678.0,"I absolutely love bus builds, I think I like them even more than tiny houses. They're longer and people just seem more creative with the builds."
TinyHouses,ffs2kh7,t1_ffrxsfd,1580171572.0,"Also, how do some of these people cook anything? A lot of tinys don't have any sort of range or even electrical outlets to use hot plates or even a coffee pot. I live in a 5th wheel and our gas line doesn't work, so I can't use the oven. If we didn't have outlets for the hotplate, toaster oven, electric skillet, etc. We'd never be able to eat at home."
TinyHouses,ffs2a0m,t1_ffrqay6,1580171371.0,"Honestly, look at how trailers and RVs deal with storage. There's lots of overhead storage usually and also usually some sort of actual closet for clothes and possibly a small dresser or space for one. I feel like if these companies that build tinys looked into these storage solutions more they could make more functional builds for people to actually live in."
TinyHouses,ffs1zib,t1_ffryy13,1580171173.0,I have to put the toaster oven on top of the dog crate when not in use because counter space is not optimal lol
TinyHouses,ffs1v2a,t1_ffr01bj,1580171088.0,"If you want to see people living tiny check out some fb groups about trailer/rv living. Tiny houses are just better quality trailers after all and they actually have some sort of storage in the bathroom, albeit minimal but it's enough that you can make it work. I live in a 36ft 5th wheel with my husband and our dog and cat. We are stationary though so we do have some clutter since we don't have to worry about packing everything up to move all the time. Those that travel the country definitely live more minimal than those that are parked more permanently because it'd be a pita to worry about putting everything away every other week. Also, I just want to point out that on almost all of the shows about tiny houses you're seeing the build and finished product before the people move in, so you don't get to see it being actually lived in yet. I also want to say how insane I think it is to go tiny with small children. They grow quickly and there's no way you can sustainably live that way with kids for any length of time unless you don't mind having zero privacy or quiet time lol"

AskReddit,ffrk543,t1_ffqsyu8,1580159677.0,"I'm not reading all of that just because you're angry about my opinions. The whole reason Jon was brought back (or, we were lead to believe anyway, and this is exactly why the last season was garbage because they just up and decided half the story arcs that have been building since the begining just didn't matter anymore) so yeah, if he didn't get to kill the night king then please tell me why they even brought him back? To fuck Dany isn't a good enough reason either. She was already well on her way to take over westeros before she met Jon. Arya had a completely different arc than Jon and her appearing out of nowhere and then killing the night king, which is what he had been trying to do for the last 5 plus seasons is incredibly dumb. They took away his entire reason for being brought back to life in the first place. I don't know why you are so angry about the truth and someone else's opinion but you do you."

AskReddit,ffogqzr,t1_ffj4gek,1580077464.0,"I paid plenty of attention to the characters and story, in fact, I rewatched everything before the final season so everything was fresh in my mind when the last season aired. You're the one who wasn't paying attention if you think that last season was good and what happened made sense to everything else that happened. The only person who got what they wanted/deserved was Sansa. Please tell me, why Jon was brought back to life, making everyone think he was azor ahai, spelling? When they just made him kill Dany, and then get basically banished instead of becoming king. Plus, why didn't he get to kill the night king?! That was his right, not arya's. She had absolutely nothing to do with any of that story arc, yet she's the one that kills him? That's only a fraction of what was/is wrong with the last season. DND fucked a lot of things up, and guess what? If grrm decides that this is the exact way things go down in the books, then he fucked up his own story too. Maybe if you get your head out of your ass and look beyond what you think people are just being haters for no reason about you'd see the facts. Even the actors hated the ending."
AskReddit,ffj3srk,t1_ffj35dk,1579989666.0,"Lol really? The ending was absolutely horrible. It made most of the character arcs pointless and there were tons of plots that ultimately were ignored or now, don't make sense. The ending of got is an absolute train wreck. You're lying to yourself if you think otherwise. Also, breaking bad is a great show too, from beginning to end. Most good shows have horrible endings unfortunately, and got takes the cake imo."
