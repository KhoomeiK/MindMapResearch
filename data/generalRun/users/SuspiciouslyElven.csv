savedyouaclick,ffe2sju,t1_ffdz0ck,1579835210.0,"Even today farmers in the safe areas unearth a ""[harvest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_harvest)"" of barbwire, shells, ammo, and other bits of scrap. This is in areas considered safe. Imagine how much is in the unsafe regions. Probably safest spots to hide and wait for help or something is in the trenches. A hundred years later, the trenches are still preferable to the no-man's-land

I'm unsure if anyone has gone *missing*, but people do [become casualties](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/world-war-i-shell-kills-two-belgiums-ypres-n56976) of a war that's been over for a century."

savedyouaclick,ffdwrc9,t3_et2bnl,1579830845.0,"Just occured to me I didn't mention it, but entering Zone Rouge is illegal. I don't know if it's like the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone where people frequently sneak in and bribe guards, or Varosha where you can get shot for trespassing.

Theory on why I can't find info on people illegally exploring it anyway: ^^^^^^^^^^its ^^^^^^^^^^haunted There's nothing to see or take. 

Lawbreakers don't want the risk.

Urban explorers dont want the risk to see fields

Looters won't find anything valuable.

savedyouaclick,ffdt41n,t3_et2bnl,1579828254.0,"As far as clickbait goes, this isn't too bad. Does ham it up a bit with the ""chilling"" and ""you'll never look at France the same way again"". Also does not supply additional information not given in the myriad of other news articles about this location(s). It's actually multiple places all categorized as being too dangerous for people or agriculture. In a few sections even wildlife struggles to reclaim the land.

What I didnt know is why arsenic levels are so high. I was trying to find that out, because holy crap 17% of the soil is arsenic in some places? But there were so many articles like this one clogging up Google searches for zone rouge that I got mad.

Anyway, [not clickbait was found with useful information](https://www.toxicremnantsofwar.info/assessing-the-toxic-legacy-of-first-world-war-battlefields/).

According to this source, Unexploded shells and gas contaminated material was burnt, which caused concentrated amounts of heavy metals in the burn sites and adjacent areas.

[Which pointed me to the source of the 176mg/kg arsenic, here.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969707004986)

So definitively, the worst spots in Zone Rouge are from the cleanup of salvageable land, whereas most areas were 'only' at 'unsafe levels'.

Don't take this as dismissive of the risk the French and Belgains have taken to reclaim their countries. I don't really know how to clean up hundreds of thousands of unexploded shells in a better way. Just that some people claiming the battles themselves caused such high levels is wrong."

Now you have an unironic fan of Wall Noise or whatever.

Edit: you can also do it Pavlov style by getting them to associate certain genres of music with good things and everything else with not good things like electric shocks or something.
