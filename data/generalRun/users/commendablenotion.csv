AnimalsBeingBros,fffnypd,t1_fffaxds,1579888041.0,"My family farm dog was a GSD. She was the best. No matter the summer or winter, the only place she wanted to be was outside. She shepherded *everything*. Chickens, cats, kids, cows...didn’t matter. If it was on the property, it was hers to protect.

In this era (1990s), it was pretty common to have an outdoor dog on the farm. And she was outside 95% of the time. When we would come home, sometimes we’d catch her “taking a break” by laying in the sun, and as soon as she realized it was us, she’d hop up and chase stray birds away, or corral some of the chickens, pretending that she wasn’t dozing in the sun. It was hilarious.

The only times she *wanted* to come in were during thunderstorms. And the only times we *made* her come in were on sub-freezing nights. Other than that, she would just whine at the door no matter what.

She died 15 years or so ago, and the tracks that she made as her “route” were still visible up until last year, when my last pup got too old to walk the route.

My old man died last year, and I think I’m done with dogs for a while. Getting tired of burying friends."

I’m done pretending like our government has the best interests of Americans in mind when doing this sorta shit. Based on all past data, we’re in no danger from Iran. The Shi’a are a human rights nightmare, but they don’t kill civilians for military purposes, unlike us.

But they realized it was too easy, so they made the rules that you could only run it forward, not throw it. But that was too hard, so they decided you could run it OR kick it forward. Then they realized that it’s tough to get it into a goal without being able to throw it, so they made the goal as wide as the field and made the rule that you only had to touch the ball down inside the goal to score. 

Americans got bored of this version, because they really like throwing things, so they decided to nix the ban on forward throws, but they knew it was very unbalanced, so they made the rule that you can only try throwing it or running it four times every 30 feet otherwise you had to let your opponent have a turn. They realized that this worked best as a full-contact affair, which made for an extremely exciting sport.
