DMAcademy,ff5r3f9,t1_ff4ylu2,1579606906.0,"I agree that players shouldn't have backstories more epic than their level, but this is different. Reincarnation  resets the scale. It's not that character's story, it's the past life's story. The character story will be having to deal with the repercussions of their soul being in a pact with a demon that they didn't make. 

It's perfectly to give notes back to a player so their backstory fits with the setting. I would tell them ""I don't like the King of ALL the goblins part, can we change that to King of one tribe of goblins"""
DMAcademy,ff5qq2w,t3_ero46e,1579606429.0,"""I'm the reincarnation of a evil goblin king"" could be a lot of fun for a DM. Especially if the character is a Lawful Good monk with no memory of their previous life. Imgaine the drama as the party fights the evil God cult and the cultist recognize them. Could be awesome reveal if the rest of the players don't know the backstory.

I also like that the flaws are tied into their previous life.

Maybe the goblin kingdom lore doesn't fit with your world, but that can be adjusted.

This is interesting backstory, a bit dramatic but not overpowered. Compared to ""Dragon ate my family and now I brood"" or ""chosen one princess has already killed said dragon at level 1"", this is good."

AskMen,fee1i2n,t3_eolsp9,1579024439.0,"Practice your social skills. Go to social mixers/ meetup with the goal of simply meeting and getting to know as many people. Do not try to pick any girls up, instead befriend them (befriend as many people as you can).

Practice being sociable and confident with new people, take interest in their lives and get good at starting fun conversations. Be a nice guy that people are happy to see again and again.

And stop judging yourself with your ""success with girls"", it's an ugly way to think."

AskMen,fdnmyhw,t3_embd60,1578589149.0,"I think a high sex drive in a new relationship is normal. To answer your question, think about your behaviour before and after sex. Are you laughing and smiling on the couch together then finding yourself moving closer and closer because you just feel at ease with her. Do you pillow talk afterwards, spoon her or just want to drink in her face. Are you thinking ""I want to have sex"" or are you thinking ""the way she smiles when talking that thing she loves is so beautiful that I need to have her right now"".

As long as your paying attenion to her when your with her and you give a crap about who she is and how she feels, then you're probaby alright"
