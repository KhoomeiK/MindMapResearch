AskReddit,ff43hux,t3_erc1ft,1579554732.0,"Begin & end with only ""I"" statements. Avoid ""you"" or blaming anything on them. Talk about what is happening with you, in general terms, taking time for yourself.

Examples: I feel like I am not much help these days, I need to take sometime for myself for a few days or weeks.

I am having a hard time handling some personal negative thoughts these days, I need to take care of that and I know it's something I need to do on my own or with a professional."

fatlogic,fdnldkk,t3_em9kad,1578588223.0,"All the people I know who where/are over 50 & have weight problems have either died, or have pretty serious health issues. Some have had cancer, others in and out of the hospital for various things. Many stay alive through prescription drugs. It seems like this feed gets a lot of declarations of wanting others to let them be ""healthy"" even if science doesn't match up. It's fascinating how people are stumbling over the basic science around being physically fit. Of course some fat people are beautiful and sexy, but that doesn't change the science. We can appreciate our bodies & others for where they are right now, but that doesn't change the facts about health."

Or choose local first, before choosing other. Just little things to make it more interesting."

However, that ""male gaze"" which needs a more inclusive name upgrade is definitely a thing & something that I didn't really understand while growing up & modeling myself to be a stellar athlete."
fatlogic,fd3d6js,t3_ejyf93,1578157114.0,Using food to cope with difficult emotions in childhood is a sign of parental neglect. Our parents are flipping the bill for all that food. Our parents or parent or guardian is handing down coping tools.

fatlogic,fcrv2m3,t3_eigs8m,1577907009.0,"I have had this sort of thought/feeling before when a friend who I perceived as being fat made a comment about us being the same size. But thinking like this I suspect is learned from a very young age that to be thin is to win at life. As a result, my siblings are either obese or anorexic. The obese siblings have given up, but hate on themselves all the time and the anorexic siblings look down on everyone and wear very tight clothing, which I must say seems like they are showing off how thin they are. And yes, the thin ones act superior."
fatlogic,fcof7ck,t1_fcoe4g0,1577830777.0,""" because my manager really made me feel like I'm making a big deal over nothing"" this conversation reminds me of a time not long ago when I was ""let-go"" for rightly accusing a co-worker of harassing clients. The power structure isn't ready for this conversation, but then, no one is really. But these women are definitely harassing & bullying you...they just aren't framing it that way in their brains. Much luck to you! Be strong :)"
