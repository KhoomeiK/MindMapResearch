politics,fh6luq1,t1_fh6ghtf,1581301162.0,It’s just like any other job. And not everyone that applies gets in so more like work benefits than volunteer service. Also their spouse and children get all those free benefits too and more so it’s less benefits for just the working soldier than socialist benefits for their entire family.
politics,fh6lbwo,t1_fh6iptv,1581300899.0,?? No other job gives people free housing so what makes you think a soldier will just squat in someone’s house?

politics,fh67tr4,t1_fh65qcy,1581295977.0,"Socialism in the government sense is a reciprocal system of tax dollars go in and you’re given these benefits or social systems as security to fall back on. So we have some socialist things in place already like social security and how military folks get to live with gov funded housing, insurance and vouchers. 

He’s pointing to the fact that billionaires/their corporations have fallback systems in case they fail, get subsidies (the government pays you money just to do your job) and of course tax breaks where they get j pay less into the reciprocal system but still get all those amazing benefits."

politics,fh24jqg,t1_fh23s2x,1581234878.0,"Lol no? It’s common sense frankly. What we have now is bogged down in bureaucracy and paperwork that is required to 1)apply for insurance 2) make insurance claims 3) insurance that changes and 4) insurance that doesn’t accept or no longer accepts certain doctors/treatments/medication/pharmacies. Now times that by all the insurances that are out there that a hospital may accept with all the plans and rules being completely different from each other. All those hours you have to pay someone to check a patients insurance for billing or make updates and learn all the changes that won’t apply to the next patient you have to do because they have a different insurance or hell maybe they have the same provider but a different insurance plan! 

Not to mention it’ll cut out the costs that result straight from sheer confusion of coverage or the insurance deciding not to pay after paperwork is filed so either you or the medical facility gets shafted."

teaching,fh1swox,t1_fh1rw8w,1581223231.0,"Dude. The government already has structures in place for states to follow (graduation system, discrimination laws, federal funds, degree regulations); this is what I was pointing out needed to be fixed/added upon not making a whole National System. (?? Also sure why you're sticking your upset with the idea with my observation of a broken system??) Schools too already have the complete option to bounce out of those federal requirements if they don't take government funds to operate so I'm not sure how much more freedom from basic standards you want before we're jumping into the pool with the problem for-profit schools/homeschooling already face where many students come out ill-equipped and ill-prepared."
teaching,fh1k2eh,t1_fh170rd,1581216733.0,"Dude that excuse is old and tiring. If we can unite the nation physically with the most expensive public works system known to man and we can unite everyone under one governing system despite all states and counties also having their own governing system, this isn’t impossible to do. You don’t need a one-size-fits-all system, you need basic a basic foundation to follow which is how our entire system for employment is run to begin with, and that’s infinitely more large and diverse than the public school system."

politics,fgz1ijr,t1_fgyzluw,1581189581.0,"I don’t think it’s so much as ‘tried’ as followed the law and his conscience. Tried because you have a vendetta, personal motive or beef with someone is what Trump did with the ambassador to Ukraine. He witnessed a crime and breach of office being committed and reported it. Yeah that it’s your boss doing the crime is super awkward and even more so now that he’s acquitted but that’s not grounds for being fired. 

But then again it is a fear that tons of Americans go through when they work for a very shitty boss who violates regulations, laws or workplace conduct that they will be fired for reporting him so in the end, I guess we shouldn’t be surprised."
ABoringDystopia,fgvat3p,t1_fguz08a,1581142658.0,"The best part is its all a big cash grab. So like the school lunch itself is usually supplied by US Foods or Aramark now, shipped in by truck and reheated, so it’s not like the kid is getting a fresh lunch. And of course being a for-profit company working with schools that aren’t rolling in dough, the food will be as cheap and unhealthy as fuck for maximum profit. 

But the more insidious part is that schools will either have an a la carte loaded up with big name snacks and much more enticing food options like Doritos, fries or Little Caesars or those things will be up front at the register for them to take when they hand in their lunch card or pay cash. It’s no different than what you have checking out in a store except no parents to say no, a hungry kid and no understanding that those cost extra and aren’t part of ‘lunch’. Plus if it’s a shitty lunch option today or the kid is extra hungry, he’s going to grab the extra food. It’s all there to pressure a little kid that has barely grasped the concept of numbers, let alone money to grab the pricier items in addition to the school lunch. If the kid is older, there’s pressure to not look poor, friends are getting it, being hungry etc. 

It’s all very good marketing on these companies part and it’s pretty much the reason all around the world, companies will push to have their food available to kids without that parental guidance to tell them no or explain why they can’t have it."

worldpolitics,fgv34su,t1_fgv0b50,1581135790.0,"Those are the loopholes that need to be closed like yesterday, that a ton of us are desperate for aka tax havens or seeing multi-million dollar companies going years without paying it. 

Most people do pay their taxes, and even if they’re playing chicken with the IRS on income, they’re still contributing due to all the other taxes (gas, food, sales, property, etc). If they get a refund for being too damn poor though, that’s a social safety net or loophole depending on your views here. Having been on both sides of the fence of paying extra in tax and getting a refund, I was taught that it was a way to get back on your feet without paying you that through a service if possible ie returning your money. Which makes sense given that most Americans put their tax refund immediately back into some sort of debt. Also interesting fact, the IRS goes after poorer tax returns than they do the rich simply because they’re easier and quicker to do than the slog that is a tax return of a company with international holdings and tons of assets that several experts have to tackle to complete. Hence also why they get away with a lot of tax fraud."

Pretty much everything you enjoy comes from taxes such as municipal water supplies, the interstate and rail system that delivers your food and amazon packages, the regulatory committees that make sure you’re not breathing in lead or eating rat droppings, legislation that prevents your neighbors from raiding your house just because they’re in a conquering mood etc. You may not benefit from every single thing your taxes pay for, but you sure benefit from it just living there. It’s why every country is the way it is, because what the people deem valuable and important and unimportant influences where the taxes go and what they do."

teaching,fguw59b,t1_fgup0ny,1581130763.0,"We kind of do need some sort of cohesive United education system of sorts because once you’re jumping state to state that’s when you see some serious nonsense. For example, I have a west coast friend who thought the Northeast was a state and wasn’t taught the Civil War in school yet being from the  east coast, I hadn’t realized the Indian Wars out west lasted as long as they did not the US Army slaughtered them on a town’s whim. Not to mention one state can totally just have a bad set of textbooks or weird requirements.

Also frustrating right now is if you’re a teacher seeking to move out of state, just transferring your license is a fucking joke."
teaching,fguvmh9,t1_fgtsbzh,1581130430.0,Socialism is contributing for the good of society so it shouldn’t matter that you’re directly benefiting from it else we’re back at that argument of ‘why should I pay for government healthcare I’m not sick!’
teaching,fguvawr,t1_fgu7l77,1581130224.0,"Well a lot of it is cleaning up loopholes and freebies in other areas. For example I taught in one of the states that always never had enough money for education. Then to boost those funds, the voters brought in the State Education Lottery which brought in tons of revenue for schools. Yet right now, we are in such a major educational funding shortage, the state got rid of tenure, master’s and certification pay and retirement benefits. 

So what happened?? 

Turns out rather than it being two sources of income for schools like everyone thought (and still think), the powers that be removed the original source of educational funding so they can give a tax cut to major corporations and now the lottery money is the new source of funding. So we make the same or less than we originally made before the lottery. 

John Oliver did a good segment on education lotteries if you want a fun gander into that bullshit."

The private schools I’ve considered applying for just want the active teaching license and/or changing it to the state of residence after you get the job."
