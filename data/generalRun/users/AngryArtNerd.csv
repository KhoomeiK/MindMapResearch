The one you have going on currently is pretty distinct and a lot of playful fun. Don’t let people nitpick about chosen style choices, a lot of good and internet/fandom popular artists warp anatomy in stylish ways. 

Please continue to develop with how you choose, soak in inspiration from your favorite sources, never stop learning new techniques and developing anatomy, make a style you’re happy with that’s all your own. If everyone drew things the same it would be boring."

AskReddit,ffb7ym8,t3_eskc2n,1579754447.0,"Honestly just be fun and engaging. Girls don’t want to hear how you’re depressed all the time or want to only hear the drama. That stuff now and again is cool but all the time pity party is a turn off. I get it, sometimes life hasn’t been good to you and being charismatic doesn’t come easy. The more you fake it the easier it comes by naturally. Pretend you have all the confidence in the world even if you don’t. 

Hygiene. Practice good goddamn hygiene. You’re a bunch of stinky mother fuckers a bunch of times and when you’re decently overweight you need to shower twice a day, some of you twice a day.

Show interest in her. Get to know her likes and learn about them a bit, you need to be less self absorbed sometimes. Listen when she talks and opens up to you. 

Most girls don’t like your memes. It is what it is. Especially ones they might not get. Please, share funny stuff, they just won’t get your specialized fandom ones most the times and lose interest in the conversation.

Here’s the big one. MAKE TIME FOR HER and don’t treat her like one of the guys. Put away some time to talk and hang out that doesn’t revolve around gaming. I can’t stress how big this one is, it broke up my first marriage because it was all about streaming and making content. 

Bonus advice for the ladies! All of the above works for you too. Have fun, be playful, don’t take everything seriously. I’m a nerdy ass pudgy chick who’s never had problems getting the guy I set my eyes on. I’ve had my share of crappy relationships, every one does, but I can’t remember the last time I was single and 95% was a pretty damn good time. 

P.S. If you’re essentially an internet troll who thinks it’s fun spending their day being shitty there is no hope for you. There’s nothing sexy about that. Game over."
sleeptrain,ff8uh2a,t3_esayri,1579696499.0,"They usually suggest sleep training after 4 months because they can self sooth easier and there is a sleep regression that happens too where their sleep habits will change and more often then not your progress will reset itself.

Even bought the 6-9 month old since she is a long baby and grew out of hers by around 4 months.

May I add I wish my partner had your drive to help. He tries for maybe 5 minutes before he throws the baby at me and then I’m stuck feeding her to sleep for a half hour to hour whenever she goes in deep sleep. You’re a good dad.

NewParents,fef5feo,t3_eoqi59,1579048603.0,"As a mom I didn’t feel much attachment. I had an extremely easy pregnancy and birth, (I found it more exhausting than painful.) even was back home and doing normal stuff after only one night in the hospital. Still I didn’t have that bond. Giving birth wasn’t a beautiful moment, and I certainly wasn’t in love. My partner took his 6 week paternity leave and it was a rough first six months. When he went back to work, life sucked. I swore up and down I couldn’t do it, it was a mistake, it was too hard. I had postpartum depression. 

I refused to take the prescribed medicine. It was tough for a month and a half more or so. Then she graduated from being a crying and pooping potato. She was getting a personality and bit by bit I was enjoying her more. She’s almost 6 months now and I can confidently say I love my baby. But it did take this whole time. 

Unfortunately I only had 4 hours away from the baby and home since she was born since she doesn’t take a bottle and feeds to sleep. My partner I still let go out and have time with friends and family, overnight stays if he may be drinking. Also dreaded work business trips. Depending what n your wife things might not change too much. DO try and give one another a break time to time?

It’s okay to wait for love until personality blooms. It’s hard. The first three months will probably really suck. I got sick and pissed at hearing “it gets better” but it does, it really does. Hang in there. You’re in for a wild ride but you can do it."
