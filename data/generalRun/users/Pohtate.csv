His helpful big cool 14 year old brother told him life was full of disappointment. I asked him how that could possibly be a comforting thing to say. He said he was being motivational. I said he was being the literal opposite. 
14 year olds man. I just can't sometimes."
AskReddit,ffei5z8,t1_ffe8jg7,1579848982.0,Seriously not much better though. Both my kids are mid year. That means people have forgotten the other crap they'be already bought them and they get tonnes. Again.

AskReddit,ffbsha4,t1_ffbr6qa,1579781052.0,I would imagine it's fairly similar to the feelings I had when my own mother stole my phone and my partners tablet to swap for drugs. Not a damn good one.

Frozen. For 5 minutes straight occasionally. She could still see fairly well then and there never ever pinching or tightness.

aww,ffbryp1,t1_ffamm7a,1579780446.0,Why? What'd she do?
aww,ffbry5x,t1_ffbnctk,1579780429.0,I like your doggos attitude. I've never heard about the stairs thing with exracers. That's interesting. So you know why that is?
aww,ffbrpxd,t1_ffbi47p,1579780159.0,My partners pup is pretty stupid to be honest so I'd love to see what her opinion is on these type of boots. She has no need for them but I'd enjoy it. She had no issue with me placing a cardboard sleeve over her neck (like a frozen meal sleeve. She was like 'Well that's weird but whatever' and kept on doing idiot dog things.
iamverysmart,ffbr9dt,t1_ffad3rt,1579779594.0,Me too. Does he need glasses? He had to examine the clip more closely than the OP so he may need some examinations done.
iamverysmart,ffbr4z0,t1_ff6aqfu,1579779445.0,My son would probably find this pretty entertaining. He might not understand it if it's not explained simply enough (he's 4) but he'd think it's cool.

AskReddit,ffbouxl,t1_ffbjc1v,1579776289.0,Sex work is work. It had nothing to do with her and the OP having sex.
AskReddit,ffblwfo,t1_ffbjwl4,1579771789.0,Is it. Is it though. Clearly the father died accidentally. He hadn't changed anything to benefit them if/when he died.

AskReddit,ff8m5bm,t1_ff6ear2,1579685342.0,Average Joe for sure. Brad Pitt I could deal with if there was some plumpness on him but yeah none of those are good for me
AskReddit,ff8m2ra,t3_erupvr,1579685233.0,I'm a woman. That's a good start. Body building in general I can deal with but as soon as I see some obvious lines anywhere I'm not interested personally.

Just today I was slowly chasing one of my cats around outside while trying to pick him up and keeping one of the dogs from spooking him. The cat is hissing like a loser at the dog though the dog is harmless. Also only in a shirt and underwear. Cat had escaped out the window. Damn animals.

AskReddit,ff2mvrk,t1_ff2ep1n,1579513908.0,I'm sorry to hear that. That would be very traumatic. Related to this my ex boyfriends father was a truckie. One of his colleagues had a woman kill herself by laying her head under one of the wheels of his semi after he'd gotten in. He only felt a small bump. That would also be a horrifying find.
