shittysuperpowers,fe0ekp9,t3_endnh7,1578811948.0,You know those cases where you feel like you desperately need to poop but then nothing happens when you get on the toilet? Or when you don't feel any need to poop but next thing you know you've sharted? What would those show?

aww,fcbl75k,t1_fcb1kdy,1577588154.0,"Their feelings are more like comfort vs uncomfortable. Mine is well socialized so he's good with everyone. I swear they have no feelings but for a few days after a really bad situation for him, he kept running to me and even curled up in my arm. Also, when he gets spooked by a dog or something, he immediately calms down when I get there. It's still probably just primitive feelings of comfort"

aww,fcbjzob,t1_fcawj2d,1577587756.0,Others have answered your other questions so here's a pic of my beardie [trying to get into the shower](https://www.reddit.com/user/hypotato/comments/eh0d92/lizard_demands_entry/). It's hard to get one of him will the water running because the glass fogs up. I don't think he likes or dislikes the water but it does signal him to poop. Baths don't work cuz he hates it and runs away but that's what a lot of owners do.
aww,fcavou8,t1_fcau2gq,1577577532.0,"Well give me all your money cuz I have the secret. If my beardie has poop, I put him in the shower and turn on the water. Immediately after he poops he's free to roam. Also he glass surfs like crazy when he's ready to poop cuz he doesn't like doing it in his tank"
