classicwow,ffpspod,t1_ffpozqn,1580104305.0,"It worked really well in retail before personal loot, since most gear could be used by everyone of that role. 

So it ended up leaning towards rolls which kept things quick and efficient and there were never loot issues.

Little tougher in classic with how funky loot can be"
BattlefieldV,ffor2mz,t3_eu7eo6,1580080678.0,"If it had the base gameplay improvements like spotting removal, fortifications, gunplay and attrition, I agree.

But BFV was meant to sell RTX cards, not produce a quality game"
classicwow,ffno5ap,t1_ffmfizy,1580068425.0,"That's not even a guild at that point, what's the point of a guild if you can barely recognize your members"
classicwow,ffnnzbe,t1_ffngmzy,1580068357.0,"That's called loot council to decide who can /roll.

My guild doesn't use it but it's my favorite. The psychology of winning your rolls instead of being handed by a person is better and the council helps keep the most dedicated eligible"
history,ffmzmoy,t1_ffjeo04,1580060511.0,"Nope! America is a monolith and has a bad racist education system that only mentions 6 million Jews killed =)

I'll take those EZ upvotes now!"
fightporn,ffme8kd,t1_ffkqnu7,1580053243.0,"It's still a sucker punch. If they don't start at distance and both are attempting to fight and defend themselves, it's a sucker punch. Because the fight hadn't started/escalated. 

If left would have thrown one 2 seconds earlier it would have been a sucker punch too."
MMA,ffjmijq,t1_ffjlu8y,1580001674.0,Lmao you haven't proven anything but your own reverence to fallacies
MMA,ffjkk5a,t1_ffjkbla,1580000342.0,"And a ""new unseen"" wrestling technique is still boring.

I'd watch stylebender over khabib any day"
MMA,ffjjggn,t1_ffj2qah,1579999603.0,"It's still more boring to watch.

An untechnical striking match can be way more interesting than a technical wrestling match"
todayilearned,ffj071w,t1_ffisq6b,1579987079.0,"You started this with a vague comment implying the need for reparations, and it took half a dozen comments before you even tried to define what you meant.

Even then, the best you could do was ""lol I don't mean giving money just a typical social program that I can't define, but it would totally be fine because people would do research about it!"" all while throwing around ""u stoopid dumb fuck"" as if that would help.

Very unimpressive. And yet, very unsurprising. I award you no points."
todayilearned,ffiksui,t1_ffijgu7,1579976254.0,"I still have no clue what you're thinking, because you're still unable to specifically define it like I requested.

You just simply copped out because you go called out in your BS

Literally nobody is surprised"
BattlefieldV,ffidplf,t3_etp237,1579971419.0,"It was a mistake to assume BFV was anything other than a tech demo to sell RTX gfx cards.

The pacific and some of the original maps were decent but they fucked up the gunplay and the game was already plagued with bugs and low content"
holdmyfeedingtube,ffidby8,t1_ffhu0b5,1579971164.0,That's not always the case. Some people in traumatic accidents and in shock can still be cognizant and recall the incident adequately
todayilearned,ffi3o6k,t1_ffhttvm,1579964157.0,What a copout. You say you support reparations and then define it as social programs? Just get out.
classicwow,ffhhb3a,t1_ffhf4o2,1579935221.0,"Correct, starfire and moonfire go boom"
classicwow,ffgu3lo,t1_ffgty68,1579915095.0,"Funny, I don't feel the need to magically judge people's ability who I haven't ever seen before to prop up my nonargument"
todayilearned,ffgskse,t1_ffgqgpg,1579913979.0,Except in cold northern places you do in fact still need more dependable base load
Art,ffgoy1u,t1_ffgo7su,1579911379.0,But how? Must be a focal length thing or somethin
classicwow,ffgnynq,t1_ffgl5xz,1579910685.0,"You actually think downvotes win an argument? I was up before I was down. It doesn't matter. 

The dps gain is negligible, and doesn't matter if it even slightly risks getting behind on throughout or risking an actual player dying.

The crux of your argument is that when it doesn't matter when pet damage exists you should heal pets.

That's not useful. When it actually matters, and a raid is tight on heals, healing hunter pets can be detrimental. 

If you're 5 healing MC without a sweaty consumed group and you have 6 hunter pets to heal, players will die. If you're 10 healing MC or have a sweaty bis team of consumed players and 2 hunters, it doesn't matter at all if you heal hunter pets unless you're speedrunning.

edit: LOL 2 DOWNVOTES, one from you. I don't even vote on yours, it doesn't matter"
classicwow,ffgf6f8,t1_ffgbx8w,1579904867.0,Following the terms of service is most certainly logical
