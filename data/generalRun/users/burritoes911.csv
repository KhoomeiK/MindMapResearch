Another pair did get mangled in the washing machine. Filled out the replacement form and sent them in and got a brand new pair right away. No questions asked. 

How long have you had your stance socks? Also curious which kind you got. For sone reason a pair that’s mostly white has held up way better than a mostly blue one. Worn about the same amount, so one was either better made or the blue dye affected the durability."

Players like Ryan Reaves have had to change their play from enforcer to another role since having an enforcer isn’t very important to teams anymore. 

Of course, there are still checking lines and players, but teams don’t want a headhunter anymore. The NHL is partially pushing for this, but so are the players. Concussions are always going to be a part of the game, but hockey’s gotten much better at addressing the issue than other contact sports.

You’ll likely get better pay with this job over longterm subbing, benefits, and it helps your resume a bit more if you don’t stay. Plus a longterm sub position for sure ends at the end date. The contract teacher position ends at the end of the school year with a good chance of another contract offer for the next year.

changemyview,fev1q6t,t1_fetolxc,1579392148.0,"Voting is kind of the bare minimum though. It’s accessible to everyone of age, means yo get to voting stations, and with proof of identification. I’ll gladly admit that is not available to every citizen, but I’d wager it is the most accessible way to affect elections and politics. 

It’s like wearing your seatbelt while driving. It’s the easiest and most accessible way to protect yourself while driving. If someone gets in an accident not wearing a seatbelt, sure it’s sad because they’re probably hurt, but I’m not going to feel that bad if they complain about their injuries if they weren’t even doing the bare minimum. I’m sure most people would agree they were being stupid and brought more pain on themself through their actions. If they were wearing it, who’s going to ask them why they didn’t have collision assist protection or something else like that? 

It’s arbitrary to an extent, but voting and seatbelts are much more accessible to the general public than protesting, donating money to campaigns, or advanced safety features like collision protection. They’re both also some of the more effective ways to improve or come closer to an outcome you’d hope for."

I always vote, but I can completely understand thag for some people it actually is a waste of their time and can benefit themself and society more by spending that time with work or their family. These people probably don’t complain much if at all though nor are they very involved with politics. 

With all that said, I don’t think it’s a waste of anyone’s time to be diligent with local elections. Your vote matters a lot there since its impact is a much larger slice of the pie than national ones. Not only does it hold more weight, but getting those candidates on transcends upwards. Imagine if dems didn’t win anything during midterms. The effects of local elections affect things above them at the national level and below them at your own town’s level."
teaching,feuorss,t3_eqg72a,1579388581.0,"We had a student transfer to my school, which has more black and POC students at it than their prior school. If there’s a more diverse school in your district, you could talk to the parents about having the kid attend one of those schools. 

Of course it would suck and you might feel like you’re giving up on the kid, but sometimes the best thing you can do for your students is getting them in the best possible situation. The student who transferred is already great friends with the other black boy in his classroom. It’s been good for both of them. 

With MLK day happening in a couple days, you could also do a day focusing on the important and long lasting impact MLK has on today’s world. Just be careful with focusing on MLK being a role model and a leader who stood up for what was right. It can make a big impact on a kid seeing that people like them are valuable, equal,  and capable of great things just like everyone else.

 I’d also second what others have said and shine light on the black history outside of the civil rights moment. Sometimes stuff like that can reinforce how they feel about their differences because now they see that people with their skin color are historically (and currently to a lesser extent) disliked. 

Here are some ideas:

There is a lot of really cool African architecture. Even though it’s not really here, it’s still something she could identify with and feel proud of. 

Music is arguably one of the only places where black culture is celebrated ubiquitously. In that world, not only are their people equal, but they’re also some of the greatest ever. 

You could also talk about all the things blacks people did to strengthen their communities. As a white guy, I’ve always considered black communities to be a lot more close and engaged with one another than white ones. This changed a lot in the 1960s partially due to welfare expansion making it economically better for families to breakup, but that’s not the doing of black peoples. 

But programs like the American society of free persons of color, African/black churches, and starting their OWN SCHOOLS because they couldn’t attend public ones are incredible things black Americans did to uplift all of their people. 

Harlem Renaissance is a really cool and seldom talked about event.

IsItBullshit,feibovn,t1_feia1x3,1579134753.0,"You can get it replaced for like $80 or something in apple stores or if you’re decent with tech hardware (or have YouTube even) you can get battery kit replacements on amazon for $20 or something around there. The iPhone 6 is known for having bad batteries compared to any other year.  Another option is to just get an iPhone SE or other good but cheap phone that will come with a mostly new battery. 

Also no, apple did not intentionally design the iPhone 6 or any other iPhone batteries  to degrade any faster than normal. Apple slowed down older models after an update to help prevent phones from shutting down or draining batteries rapidly. Everything I can find says nothing about them intentionally messing up any model’s batteries. The iPhone 6 just had battery issues because of software bugs and the battery being a bit small (big increase in screen size from iPhone 5/5s to 6). 

Unless you’ve got proof of apple intentionally ruining batteries, let’s chill with the conspiracy. Battery technology is just really lagging compared to other tech improvements."
Teachers,fei9fhk,t1_fei1qy7,1579133248.0,"It’s a good thing students have to stay in school for almost exactly ten years (minimum)! Every kid comes into the year with different strengths and weaknesses. My priority is to make sure they’re better than they were yesterday. If they’re a better student and more capable person by the end of the year, then I know I did something right and so did they. If I don’t have them next year, then its time to pass the baton along to the next teacher. 

What I’m saying is we can only do so much in one year with kids. Now, if every year, month, week, or day  that kid walks out better than they cane in, that’s a win."

IsItBullshit,fecbok4,t1_fec02j1,1578970260.0,"I was just pointing out race actually can and does play a factor, international or not. Colleges and Universities tend to put a lot of value on diverse representation and perspectives. There are plenty of extremely wealthy families in and outside of the US (at least because again I can’t speak for all countries) that they aren’t targeting foreigners. Foreigners just usually do very well in school or don’t pursue high education. They also might be favored because of their race or home country distinguishing them from other applicants with similar academics. 

It’s also not true that colleges can charge international students more. They can charge them the same tuition they would any other student and deduct any scholarships they qualify for or loans they’ve signed. 

There’s a lot of misinformation in this comment thread. Googling some of these topics like affirmative action will yield better answers."
IsItBullshit,fec1aqh,t1_febt7q5,1578965192.0,"That is not entirely correct, for the USA that is. I’m not up to speed with other country’s practices with it. Since 2003, in the Gutter vs. Bollinger Supreme Court trial, colleges have been permitted to consider race a factor when admitting students. This is at the federal level and local state laws such as Michigan have made this use illegal for state funded schools."

IsItBullshit,fdxqmd7,t1_fdxjk8h,1578771882.0,"If it’s that bad, you’re way better in the long run (cost wise) getting an under sink water filter than buying single use bottles. You can get a decent one for under $100. At the very least, get a large reusable container and go to a self service primo filler (Walmart if you’re in the states) and fill up at $0.35/gallon. 

To put it in perspective though, tap water is roughly $2 for every thousand gallons. An $80 under sink filter [sink filter ](https://www.amazon.com/Frizzlife-System-High-Capacity-Filtration-System-0-5/dp/B07MFYQBTX) is good for two years or roughly 1600 gallons. They recommend 6-8 months, so let’s say you play it safe and only do 1000 gallons. The filters are $20. 

Let’s say you drink 80oz or .625 gallons daily. Filling at a self service station for the first bit of computation. Then we get .625 gal/day * $0.30 per gallon putting you at roughly 19 cents a day (18.75 cents actually but rounding and sig figs). That’s $69.75 for ever thousand gallons and not considering the cost or time to go get that water. You save about $13 for your first thousand gallons at a refill stations compared to the sink filter. Compared to buying by the gallon in milk jugs at about $1.30, you’re saving a dollar for every gallon, or $1000 for your first thousand gallons. 

So in this case, a short term fix like self service fills is the most cost effective option beating under sink by about $13. If you buy individual gallons, you’re just buying really expensive ways to pee. Just buy a $15 nalgene and don’t waste your money. 

After that first thousand gallons though, your filtration system is still fine but simply needs the $20 filter replacement. Now your at $22 and saving $48 every thousand gallons. Over a year at 80oz a day, you’re drinking 228 gallons a year, so it make take a while for savings to occur, but it is the cheapest longterm option for truly shitty tap water. 

My main point though is not fill stations vs under sink filters, because they’re pretty comparable price wise in short or long run. That’s mostly going to depend on your personally preference. My actual main point is even if you’re buying by the gallon jugs, you’re wasting thousands of dollars just to drink water which should be avoidable in almost all situations of day to day life. 

Don’t waste your money. Refill stations use reverse osmosis water, which is about as much water as water can be without distilling it. Artisan water my ball sack. That’s just artisan marketing."
