We saved up for a coupla months to buy Pacman. It was one of the most expensive. And it sucked. 

Asteroids, Yar's Revenge and Combat were our favorites. Combat came with the console itself but was one of the few games that could be player vs. player."
OldSchoolCool,feyqt5o,t3_eqw0st,1579449380.0,"Sometime around July 1980 my brother and I hatched a plan to scrimp and save every dollar possible so we could buy an Atari 2600 at the annual Sears post-Christmas sale. We needed $99.

I was 12 and he was 10. 

We mowed lawns, we found change on the street, we saved all our birthday money. No source of income was too small to go into the jar. 

More importantly, we stopped walking down to the bar and grill on the corner to play video games. All those quarters were going into savings. 

Coming up on Christmas, we'd $91. But my grandmothers always sent us a $5 check (each). We were set. Add in that $20 we had enough. 

Come Christmas morning, my dad says 'hey, go get me the newspaper'. So I wander outside (and past the 'dining room' we never used for anything). I come back and tell him that I cannot find it. Dad sends my brother out to look for it (again, past the dining room).  He comes back and says he can't find it. 

My dad is getting visibly annoyed and finally says 'What is today?'

""Christmas.""

'Do they deliver a newspaper on Christmas day?'

""No idea.""

'Well, they don't! Will you two idiots just go into the dining room?'

So we did. 

And there was a new TV, a new Atari 2600 and two little floor chairs already set up. We'd both walked right by it twice without noticing. 

Steve and I freak the fuck out, as you'd expect. 

Eventually mom comes in and says 'now you can use your money to buy games for it.'

It is, bar none, the most amazing Christmas gift we ever received. Steve and I still talk about it now and again."
RedditForGrownups,feyn0e0,t3_eqwpuv,1579447775.0,"> For the people that experienced the entire evolution from computers, to the internet, to everyone having a phone, this whole thing has to be quite a surreal experience

Not really. It happened incrementally over 40+ years.

For the most part the things people brought up in this thread are the least interesting parts of the internet and goes to show how little people understand it even today. 

You can easily just not use social media. It isn't hard. i know lots of people under 50 who just don't. My daughter (15yo) doesn't use anything that involves anyone other than her friends. It is always a big deal when they decide to add someone to their Instagram circle. 

Way bigger is the news available. As recently as 1989, I lived in a place where we got one TV channel. (KOB-4 out of Albuquerque). Today in that same spot I would have full access to pretty much anything from the BBC to Pravda to PennySaver without any hassle at all. At the time I got more news from Usenet than I did from anything else. You could get the Albuquerque Journal, but often it was a day behind by the time it was delivered. 

But the real revolution is in the parts that a consumer only sometimes sees and already takes for granted.

The entire banking industry has completely transformed how it interacts with the consumer and itself. Way back in the day I remember when big drive trough banks were being touted as a major convenience. 

Everyone had to go to the bank on Friday to deposit paychecks and withdraw cash for the weekend. ATMs weren't even a thing yet, much less being able to do your banking from home. 

And suddenly we didn't have to get out of our cars to do all that because the bank added 10 drive up stations. Amazing! 

And already outdated and gone. The very idea of having to physically go to the bank is just weird today. I had to deposit a check last week. My bank doesn't even have tellers anymore. I don't know when they got rid of them. I haven't actually been there in years. 

Heck, for that matter, I'm old enough to remember when you actually had to go to the DMV to do things like renew your car's registration and you'd carve out at least a whole afternoon for it. I don't even know the last time I went to the DMV. 

In short if your answer to this question touches on social media at all you're missing almost all of the real impact of the internet."

A bike is a way better way to go.  I spend maybe $50/year on tires, lube and the like. My bike tool kit was $75.

The SCOTUS decision where this comes from (Schenk v. US) is a horrible court decision. Not quite Dred Scott bad, but in the ballpark. 

This argument was used to imprison a guy for protesting (via pamphlets) the US draft in WWI. 

Regardless, the decision was completely overturned in 1969. The current standard is ' incitement of imminent lawless action'.

Flying a flag, no matter how offensive or objectionable, does not reach that level."

My dad wanted a dog. Mom said not until I was at least 1 yo. 

Two weeks after my 1st birthday dad took me to the Honolulu shelter to find a dog that I liked. 

Looking back on it from 50 years later this seems like a really terrible idea. On top of it all, dad was in the Navy, so he was often gone for months at a time. 

In any case we found a 6mo puppy that I loved and who thought I was amazing.
