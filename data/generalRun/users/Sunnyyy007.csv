TikTokCringe,fgilkv3,t1_fgidt84,1580825115.0,I think it depends on the reasoning and emotional maturity really. Also on how long you've been together. If a couple of 29 year olds get married after 6 months i would consider that more crazy than a couple who marries at 24 after having dated for 9 years.
AmItheAsshole,fggvika,t3_ey8ta8,1580770496.0,"NTA, obviously. I hope that you will know that it is soon too.

I get your situation, i'm 19 now and i moved out a month after i turned 18.
I never told my parents my address because i just didn't feel comfortable. Afterwards i wasn't allowed to anymore either way but they didn't want to accept it. We kept in contact for quite a while but i pretty much broke off contact right before i turned 19 a few months ago. I miss my siblings a lot, but my mental health is definitely thriving since then."

AmItheAsshole,fg3b5lt,t3_ewec5m,1580476751.0,"I'm actually gonna go against the grain and say NAH. If she commented on it, i'd assume that she might've met your gf before and all that jazz. If she knows your gf and cares about her then i could also see why she would think that. 

Not knowing you and your relationship, i'd also agree that a nine year gap is very creepy. But i'd also be upset if someone i didn't know came up to me to tell me my relationship to a person i love is creepy. 

Your reaction was reasonable but it does feel childish. You could've also asked her why she thinks that way. Maybe she accidentally blurted it out (happens to me too), maybe she has a certain stereotypical picture in your head that you just reassured. 

In the end, its not your job to educate people around you and she had no right to comment on it and maybe this taught her to be more careful with her words."
childfree,fg39ddk,t3_ewk9ci,1580475157.0,"I'm so so sorry this happened to you. I don't understand how she thought you'd be elated by the fact that she changed her opinion on one of the biggest dealbreakers and admitted to raping you for several months. She probably would deny the rape accusations if you layed the facts on the table.

Again i'm really really sorry. I hate that men have to deal with this and only get shut up because people decided that women have more say in a relationship. Your feelings are just as valid as hers and it's disgusting of her that she made it such a big issue including the people around you guys to back her up, that was not her place.

Try to get a vasectomy before you start dating again. Men have a harder time protecting themselves from these things because they have to depend/trust their partner 100%"

Not saying all of the people from regions like these are like that but I've experienced (and seen) a lot of the children with parents from middle eastern having to deal with a looot of guilttripping because for some reason the parents often think that their children owe them something. They were taught to care for their parents so they expect the same. It's like self-raised slaves."
childfree,ffvme53,t1_ffu2cc5,1580267544.0,"Idk where you are from, but in the international flights i have been in, babies are not allowed to be held, either you have a seat for the kid seperately or you get a seatbelt that is attachable to the other seatbelts so it can sit on the parents lap with a seatbelt."
childfree,ffvm866,t3_ev6ufg,1580267429.0,"What most people actually don't realise is that it's not as much selfish for other passengers as it is for the baby. We had to fly with my little brother when he was really really young because my grandpa died and our doctor told us that he would strongly advise us against it but he understands as it's a difficult situation.

The baby can't control when he cries and when he doesn't, but babies don't cry for no reason most of the time.
They are crying because they are confused and partially really in pain, my mother actually ended up really regretting it because my brothers ears apparently got more sensitive or something.

So not only are these people putting others through this, they are also putting their child through immense health risks, the worst thing that could happennis that they could go (partially) deaf if i remember correctly.

Still i wouldn't comment on it, because like i just said you never know the situation of the people travelling. I just lost my grandfather when we traveled with my brother and i can assure you it was even less fun for us."

relationship_advice,ffq5cpj,t1_ffpjru0,1580121378.0,"It doesnt matter what led to it, she slapped you. She physically assaulted you. My boyfriend suffered from depression very very badly a while ago (it got better you could say) and he never NEVER slapped me. And i'm pretty sure I irritated him quite a bit unintentionally now and then. 

Same goes the other way around. I hit a mental low and the ""worst"" thing i did was ask for space so we took a break for a week and then talked about it. Because that's what you do, you verbally adress things and let them rest when its getting too heated to be able to hold a more rational conversation, even if its just 20 minutes after the initial ""fight"".

You are valid. Every person deserves a safe place and to be respected and unharmed. It doesn't help that she is leeching off of you and still treating you like this."
raisedbynarcissists,ffid3ql,t3_etqm47,1579971010.0,"It's totally okay! You should do it actually, you need the distance between your mom and yourself.

They control us with our guilt, they raised us to feel guilty for it. It will be hard at first but you will end up feeling the best that you ever have."
childfree,ffi72os,t1_ffhwbi3,1579966804.0,"I 100% disagree. If you dont tell her, you might end up resenting her for something that might've been completely preventable.

Being friends means being supportive of each other, if you tell her earnestly that you support her and are there for her but cant deal with the pictures due to your phobia, she will understand. If she doesn't, then thats not your fault. 

If she is a good friend, which you stated she is, she will understand that this has nothing to do with her (tho there is no con to telling her that too). 

You're friends, so talk to each other, be honest about your feelings. Shutting them away completely in fear of her getting upset is not a good base for the following time that you will spend with her.

Humoring her would be lying to her in this case because you don't seem annoyed but rather taken aback by it physically.

Best of luck for dealing with this situation OP! :)"

relationship_advice,ffhxspc,t3_etne2x,1579958542.0,"I am so sorry this happemed to you. What your boyfriend did was sexual assault/rape.

He had no right to keep going when you didn't feel comfortable anymore. Even if you give your consent in the beginning, that doesnt mean he is in the clear for ignoring you revoking your consent.

Don't blame yourself dear, your reaction is a common one. 

I doubt he will listen to you and he might (quite possibly) try to spin it into a certain way to make you believe its your fault that he raped you if you bring it up. I mean, he already did in a way after all.

I dont know how the rest of your relationship looks like, maybe he was just trying to ignore how much he f'd up in that situation. It might be possible to sit down with him, look hin straight into the eyes and tell him what he did was sexual assault, it hurt you and you aint here for it but he most likely wont accept it.

I usually hate saying this but i'd advise you to break up with him and talk to an adult that you trust about what happened."
