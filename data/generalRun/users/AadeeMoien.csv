That doesn't mean the reality of the power balance is lost on the colonized. A Brit tooling around Burma in the 50s is probably not there out of an abiding love for the people.

As for handing them out or throwing them out, it's a work of fiction so we can't do more than argue about interpretation. It can be read as the child lied because this guy is demanding to know where they found it. I can also be read as Alfred considered handing them out children without a care being throwing them away.

What it would do though is depreciate the value of subsequent bribes. Nobles like gemstones because the peasants don't have them.

In Jesus' case I think the Bible actually pretty explicitly spells out that he was officially killed for rebellion after being declared ""King of Judea"" (hence the Romans sardonically hanging the plaque reading I.N.R.I. *Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum* from the cross).
