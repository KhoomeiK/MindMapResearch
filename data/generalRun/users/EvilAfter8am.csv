TooAfraidToAsk,ffevqp3,t3_eswyq6,1579867583.0,"I’ve had 4 children and getting pregnant felt scary easy. 1st child was a pill baby. I was you n, missed a pill, took antibiotics and wham. The error plus the reduced efficacy meant that getting pregnant was possible. He wasn’t planned. Baby #2 was a first try, pregnant that night. Baby #3 was also a first try. Baby #4 we tried for 4 months, which is nothing in terms of trying. Granted, it’s harder if you avoid that fertility window, but as others have stated, the window is completely flawed and sperm can live in the vagina. Pregnancy aside, you don’t want a disease that is incurable, so I urge you to always use a condom!"
