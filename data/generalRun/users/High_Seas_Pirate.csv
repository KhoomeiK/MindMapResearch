AskReddit,fe1weua,t3_enbyhj,1578831720.0,"Honestly, any sauce you're using with meat can be improved by applying pan sauce techniques. Stick some butter or olive oil in the bottom of your pan when you cook your meat to help bring it to a nice golden brown. Once your meat is all done, take it out of the pan and set it aside. Don't just dump your jar of spaghetti sauce over it on the plate and call it a day, put that shit in the pan you cooked your meat with and use a wooden spoon to release the cooked brown bits from the bottom of the pan and into your sauce. Now your sauce will taste amazing AND be warm. 

Also, learn how to salt to taste. The biggest misconception with those three words is that people don't do it because they assume it means ""salt until you can taste the salt"" and they don't like the taste of salt so they don't do it. That's not what that means. Imagine a bell curve. Vertical axis is ""flavor"", horizontal is ""amount of salt added"". The more salt you add (up to a point) the more it strengthens the flavors of the food you're cooking, beyond a certain point though is when you start to taste the actual salt. Practice adding a bit of salt as you cook and finding that sweet spot each time to where your flavors pop without actually tasting salty. If you ever over-salt, you can usually save it by throwing a potato in the mix. Those things are salt sponges.

Try this the next time you make spaghetti:

* Dice up a yellow onion, pan sear on low in a bit of butter until golden and translucent. Maybe add some garlic too if you're feeling it, but not until the very end when the onion is basically already done. Garlic takes much less time to brown. Set aside the onion (and garlic).

* In that same pan, add a bit more butter if needed (you only ever need enough to cover the bottom of the pan) then add boneless chicken breast or tenderloins. Cook on low to medium-low until just before your meat thermometer says it's done, then turn your heat up for the very end to medium or medium high to finish off. You're looking to get your chicken a nice golden brown pan sear. When done, remove the pan from heat temporarily (to avoid burning that good shit in the bottom of your pan while you prep the next steps).

* Take your chicken and cut it into medallions or whatever other bite size pieces you prefer.

* In the same pan you've been using this whole time, dump in your favorite jar of sauce. Stir in your onions, garlic and chicken, then put back on the burner on low. Use a wooden spoon to mix everything and scrape the cooked bits off of the bottom of your pan so it gets mixed in with a sauce. Use a wooden spoon for two reasons: 1) It doesn't draw heat off your food like metal will and 2) it won't fuck up the bottom of your pan like metal will. You want to release bits of browned chicken into your sauce, not bits of teflon.

* Let it simmer until it's just a little thinner than you want the final product to be. Your taste may vary, but generally I look for it to be just thick enough to coat my wooden spoon. Salt to taste as you do this.

* While your sauce is simmering, cook your noodles by the box directions. Do: add plenty of salt to your water. Do not: add olive oil to your water. That trick about it keeping your water from boiling over is bogus. Instead it will just coat your noodles and keep your sauce from sticking to that noodly goodness. Remember to stir your noodles a few times while they cook to keep them from sticking to each other.

* Sauce all ready? Noodles ready too? Cool. Strain your noodles, then dump those mother fuckers in with the sauce and mix it all together. Remove from heat and serve. Top with parmesan cheese. Not that white powdery bullshit either. Actual grated Parmesan. You can get it pre-grated at the grocery store in tubs in the fridge aisle."
