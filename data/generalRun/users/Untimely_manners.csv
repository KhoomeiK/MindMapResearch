australia,ff5d2ti,t3_erjgub,1579587878.0,"Career ethics changed. Gen Xer here and I was taught in school that stick with your job, show loyalty, put in the hard yards. Bosses do not like employees that have a long resume. It shows they can't stick to one thing. Because that was true when boomers where applying for work as youngsters.

But it had changed. Loyalty means you will be taken advantage off by being offered lower pay or less perks. Showing good work ethic means the boss will take advantage by dumping extra work on you.

Staying in the one job shows you have no experience but that one thing you are good at.

If i had known this I would have changed jobs a lot more often and believe I would have been my boss by now albeit at another place of employment"

I don't answer because in my experience it is never a pleasant call which is why they have hidden their number, hoping I will answer to find out who it is. This could be an old toxic mate, that has found my number and wants to get back in touch. 

Work wanting me to do overtime, treat me better when I am at work and I might want to come in for overtime but coming in for overtime just means more to use against me.

If answering private number always ended in me getting a nice surprise, I would always answer them but it is very rarely to my benefit to answer a private number, it always benefits the caller."

I looked up as I stalled to see a semi-trailer hurtling through his red light. He probably would have killed me if I did not stall my car.

On that same hill still a new driver, I was following behind a long truck with this giant circular saw on the back. Next thing this saw had jumped up and started rolling down the road towards me but last minute it veered off into the bush and fell. The truck driver stopped, got out and looked, then got back in and drove off.

That road freaked me out for a long time."

However to the story. Initially it sounded like she argued with the assistant, came across more like shock. I can see why she would yell to go save the dogs. Who are you going to send Ozzie? He was injured, Sharon can only be so much use, hence why they hired an assistant to help.

It did get worse, she sounded quite brutal, maybe they had, had issues with the assistant before and this was the final straw.

Normal rotation for tidying gardens happens, however we were told to put in fault reports that our departments gardens needed cutting, did not matter we knew it would eventually rotate but because we submitted the fault report, we then got charged.

Parks had to come out and tidy our lawn even though they only did it as part of their normal rotation, so really nothing happened because of our fault report.

It was a way to use our excess funds to top up their department because legally they were not allowed to just take the money as it was part of our budget.

Eventually this happened for every department, we ended up being the only department that had to pay separately for our electricity, however we did not pay an electricity bill we had to pay our finance department to pay our bills.
