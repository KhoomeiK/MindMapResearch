I had hopes that what I saw then in 2008 was just a fluke stemming from the popularity of Ron Paul taking a modern approach to Newt Gingrich's *Contract with America*.  Which in part was fueled by the Koch's *Citizens for a Second Economy*. Gingrich and Koch brothers always served as an outside influence into the Republican party, but party leadership at most held them at bay.

Ever since 1994 with Gingrich and the second rise of his mentality in 2002, I've been quite wary about the direction of the Republican party.  When Ross Perot's 1992 and 1996 bids crumbled, I think it showed that the room for a third party was just not in the cards.  To that end I always had the underlying sensation that a third party would instead attempt a coup in an already established party, what I saw in 2008 was the first attempt at that and a doubling down on that in 2012.

RNC Chair Reince Priebus was pretty much the final straw.  Long had it been known the guy was a push over and it was at that point I knew to take my exit from the party.  That without a strong leadership, someone was bound to usurp the power of the party.  When Trump won the nom in 2016, it was the materialization of what I had feared most.

I foolishly thought that all of this would be the catalyst to some third party to rise up in 2016, but I was way off mark.  2018 and going into 2020, I've realized there isn't a third option and that if I don't push back on this new Republican party from the other side, then there wasn't much point to my vote in the first place.

I still hold hope for a true third party in America, I think the political conversation of the modern day has broaden enough to allow it.  But I can't cling to a false hope, at least not right now.  Not with this current President."

politics,fffh9o6,t1_fffbw1o,1579883927.0,"It's the Department of Justice that would file any case. Typically the DoJ has favored out of court settlements and fines versus criminal prosecution. So the idea is that we would return to filling suit as opposed to fines and penalties.

One of the reasons for the change initially was that large companies could drag cases out past the term of a particular President. When a new President was in place the newly appointed AG would then drop the case and settle.

Going after CEOs in a court of law requires long term commitment that would transcend presidential terms. Heck, any form of justice requires that actually if the target has seemingly limitless resources."

This was talked about a few years ago when Republicans attempted to storm the House floor during a recess and attempted to turn on the lights and cameras.

EDIT:  [Here's something](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/when-democrats-turned-out-the-lights-on-republicans/488321/) for you to read about the time the Democrats stormed the floor in 2016."
politics,ffczjln,t1_ffcz2p0,1579810479.0,"Republicans are looking ahead.  They need to sow as much disorientation as possible to prevent Biden having any solid ground during the election.

That's ultimately what the whole Impeachment thing comes down to in the Republican's minds.  Republicans think that the impeachment is just a smokescreen for the election on Trump and thus they're attempting their own right back.

That this whole impeachment might be something related to the preservation of Democracy just hasn't occurred to them.  To them, all of this is just political ploys.  You can hear it when they say ""the people"", ""the election"", ""the media"", etc...  Nothing about ""our nation"", ""our democracy"", ""our laws and the democratic norms of our society""."
politics,ffcuokp,t1_ffcsjcw,1579807626.0,"Blackburn is an idiot.  The aspect of her that is most admired by folks in Tennessee is pretty much the reason people like her shouldn't even run for office.  She is a strong mouthpiece for the Republican party.  Whatever the planks are, she is unabashed in her insistence of party over all other.

That Blackburn ever has ever had an original thought is clearly not in question.  The answer is a resounding no. To that end, people have time and time again elected her in Congress and elevated her to Senator on the sole role of ""useful idiot"".

I actually met her face to face in Bell Buckle during a stump she had when running for Senate.  Even when prompted for an answer on a pretty standard issue, would she support any House effort to reduce debt, her answer to me at the time was ""If the President seeks to address those issues, I would gladly work with him.""  The rest of her answer, to paraphrase was, something along the lines that a reduction in debt effort would more than likely not be forthcoming if Democrats took the House.

In something as easy as ""hey would you reduce the debt"" her retort was pretty much, only if the President told her to do so.  I was under the impression that I was just giving her a question to phone in here, but nope, it had to include something requiring her stance that she would be the President's puppet.  All she needed was a ""yes/no"" maybe a little follow up on that, but that she went out of her way to indicate that she would explicitly follow the lead of the President on the matter.  Just disgusting."
