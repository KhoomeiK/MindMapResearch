todayilearned,ff92h90,t1_ff90si1,1579703219.0,"I mean, the peasantry were obviously boned. But the officers were all some form of nobility grown up with a golden spoon and the best education money could buy.

For the officers it was basically a big game, with obviously big stakes and success for them meant success in life. But they were well enough removed from ordinary life to give two rats asses about the troops.

Although officers did in some form care for their troops, losing troops, or them not being skilled enough in combat (or basic soldiering etiquette) was a black mark on the officer, so in many ways the officer 'invested' his time and energy into making his boys into the best boys of the military.

Naturally, the one thing most officers didn't invest was their actual lives, because why die when you can get peasants to do it for you.

Old timey war, as current day wars, were dumb as hell."
todayilearned,ff920j7,t1_ff8wym2,1579702879.0,"It was simply one of those etiquette things you wouldn't fathomably do in combat.

Also an envoy was someone who willingly put themselves in enemy territory to parlay with the enemy side, often unarmed and unable to defend himself. And even when they refused to parlay, they'd never kill the envoy. 

Because imagine if they did shoot envoys, and they had to send their own envoy at a future date, it would just become an eye-for-eye messenger-shooting competition.

 Before phones/telegrams/etc. there had to be someone that had to deliver news to the other side, so it was only natural to treat them as non-combatants even if outside their envoy-duties they'd be a combatant."

sports,fednkaj,t1_fedmk3n,1579015843.0,"The offensive player needs to control the ball before it's counted a catch, which means he has to have clear control of it (no bobbling, fumbling around, etc.), and he needs to have both feet or his body on the ground. The ball cannot have hit the ground either. (If he falls/slides down and then catches before it hits the turf, that counts as a catch).

The defender can try and catch it himself, or slap it away. Once the receiver is playing the ball, the defender can go up and try and knock it out of his hands, or tackle him before he can get full control. Pulling/pushing him to make him lose his balance and lose control of the ball, etc.

The defender can also touch the player in smaller ways before the catch, he just can't physically move him (or prevent him from moving, i.e. holding him in place). But there's always some shoving goign around to get the defender/receiver off balance enough.

Also like mentioned, once the ball is being played by the receiver (he jumps up for it, turns around to catch it, extends his arms out, etc.), then it's fair game for the defender to prevent a catch, as long as the ball is in close proximity. So whilst you can't tackle a guy, there's still physicality between defender and receiver on the play.

So basically, it's harder than it sounds like for the receiver. And that also involves him getting to the right spot, and the quarterback (thrower) throwing the ball just right for a catch where the defender can't make a (good) defensive play."

Like others have said, how strictly they adhere to their religious leanings depends on the school. But schools can't force children to follow specific religious curriculum that goes against the convictions of the child and parents.

Also almost all these schools come from a time where there was a much bigger religious divide in the Netherlands, which honestly wasn't all that long ago (it's thawed in the past 50 or so years). As such many schools still identify with their original religious leanings, and in a lot of cases it's very much a symbolic identity.

I spent my first 7 grades on a Catholic school (currentl 29yrs old), in the early years there were some bible readings and going to church on easter/christmas/etc., but it was all optional even back then, I can only imagine it's become less strict in the past 20 years.

But ultimately it's best to inquire at the schools specifically how far they lean into their religious identity.

Just remember, even if they're a Catholic school, they can't force your child to follow curriculum that you as a parent do not identify with. Neither can a catholic school demand their teaching staff be practicing catholics either."
