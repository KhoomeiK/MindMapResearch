My dad is a classic sci-fi fan, having read all the great stories from Asimov, Heinlein and Clarke, and he'd loved the fifties moves as well.  I read the books and watched the movies as well, often with him.  Of course, those films are often low-budget and short on real dramatic heft.

But ANH and TESB has passion, scope, humor and action.  They were old-fashioned, swashbuckling serials redressed in the whiz-bang sparkle of new special effects and a more modern and snappily paced style of storytelling.

Bester also wrote ""The Demolished Man"", which is an amazing detective story of a murder in a world filled with telepaths which makes most crime impossible.

Maria lived a troubled life, and yet she brought a fierce vulnerability and sensuous passion to the stage and bared her soul.  She was sometimes criticized as being lacking in technique or vocal prowess, but I would rather someone sing from their heart and make a few mistakes than give a perfect rendition that lacks emotional resonance.

Lyrics below in Italian and English:

 ""Vissi d'Arte"" Italian Lyrics

Vissi d’arte, vissi d’amore,  
non feci mai male ad anima viva!  
Con man furtiva  
quante miserie conobbi aiutai.  
Sempre con fè sincera  
la mia preghiera  
ai santi tabernacoli salì.  
Sempre con fè sincera  
diedi fiori agl’altar.  
Nell’ora del dolore  
perchè, perchè, Signore,  
perchè me ne rimuneri così?  
Diedi gioielli della Madonna al manto,  
e diedi il canto agli astri, al ciel,  
che ne ridean più belli.  
Nell’ora del dolor  
perchè, perchè, Signor,  
ah, perchè me ne rimuneri così?

## English Translation of ""Vissi d'Arte""

I lived for my art, I lived for love,  
I never did harm to a living soul!  
With a secret hand  
I relieved as many misfortunes as I knew of.  
Always with true faith  
my prayer  
rose to the holy shrines.  
Always with true faith  
I gave flowers to the altar.  
In the hour of grief  
why, why, o Lord,  
why do you reward me thus?  
I gave jewels for the Madonna’s mantle,  
and I gave my song to the stars, to heaven,  
which smiled with more beauty.  
In the hour of grief  
why, why, o Lord,  
ah, why do you reward me thus?"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazing_Lazers

It's a great vertical shooter that has two key components that made it one of my favorite shmups of all time:

1. You have five settings for the speed of movement of your ship, so that you can slowly increase it and be able to better dodge enemy fire.

2.  As you gain power-ups, a shield grows around your ship, enabling you to take a few hits before dying.  This was my saving grace.  I love shooters, but I HATE playing with a glass cannon.  It's just too Draconian for me!

The other thing I loved is that there are four power-ups for different lasers and four power-ups for a secondary attack/defense.  Both gain in power the more power-ups you get.  My personal favorite was laser power 1, which is labelled using Roman Numerals.  Combine that with the secondary Homing Missile, and you'd get eight missiles instead of four, AND the more of those power-ups you got, the missiles went faster!

I got to where I could clean out most levels with this combo right up until the very last level!

Here's a playthrough to wet your appetite!

gaming,fffocxn,t1_fffh6eu,1579888278.0,"For me, it's not just the sheer amount of PC-oriented info requirements and downloads, it's the fact that the standard controller is, IMHO, utterly unsuited for FPS games unless you've NEVER used a keyboard/mouse.  I've been a PC game since DOOM, so my muscle memory is deep.  However, my last game console was the Turbografx-16, so I'm very much behind in game controller familiarity!

I tried.  I really tried.  My used PS3 came with several major titles like ""The Last of Us"", ""Call of Duty"", and other big names, but I couldn't get comfortable.  Moving and shooting with those teeny-ass thumbsticks was a disaster.  I stumbled around like a glitched character.  Aiming and moving was impossible.  I tried all of the games multiple times, but it never got better.

I suppose if I had kept at it for an hour a day for weeks and weeks I could have improved, but I don't have the time, and frankly, I don't think that the standard controller is good enough.  Without the precise aiming control of a mouse and the complex movement possibilities of a keyboard, I just died and died and died.

""Tomb Raider"" was actually working for a bit, but then I got to the part where you had to shoot some wolves with your bow and arrow.  The aiming with the thumbsticks was horrific.  I either didn't move it far enough or it over-corrected.  Those wolves ate my ass like a hungry porn star, and I got tired of dying really fucking quick.

But I have Journey, Star Wars Complete Saga, and Ratchet & Clank: A Crack in Time, and those are more suited to the limited capabilities of the standard controller.  I would love it if there third-party controllers that worked better, but based on what I've read, the few that are desirable are WAY too expensive given how little I would actually use them.

The other issue with consoles is that they eventually get replaced, and you can't always play those games again as they aren't re-released on the new platforms.

However, I can still fire up ""Dungeon Keeper II"" and ""TRON 2.0"" and have an enjoyable trip back into gaming history!

movies,fffgpnc,t1_ffdt68k,1579883584.0,"Interesting!  Bill Burr is one of my favorites.  Of course, he's very different from Carlin as he doesn't dig as deep and doesn't do much research, but at least he acknowledges that.

In one of his specials he even says: ""Don't follow me!  I don't read!  It makes me sleepy!""  Of course, it's impossible to say how much truth there is in that statement, but I appreciate that he's not trying to present himself as some levitating, mystical philosopher.

I love Bill Burr's material for the most part, although his last special had some bits that were too caustic even for me, but I suppose that's part of any comedians evolution.  They gotta try stuff, and especially now, it's hard to do that without pissing people off, so I appreciate that he's pushing back on cancel culture in the same way that Dave Chappelle did in his last special.  I LOVED that bit and I completely agree with him.

Carlin really was the best.  You could tell that he spent almost if not more of his time researching his subjects instead of writing jokes, so the punch lines really had impact because you felt the power of the truth behind them.  While Bill Burr does spend some of his time bitching about things like population control, I think his bit about sinking cruise ships is fucking hilarious precisely because of the way he presents it.

My favorite Carlin special will always be ""Back in Town.""  There's only one joke in there that doesn't quite work, but otherwise I think it's a perfect performance."
