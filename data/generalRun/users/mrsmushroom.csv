YouShouldKnow,ffi0mue,t3_etgrhl,1579961455.0,This is very cool. Thank you. I'll be showing friends.
mildlyinfuriating,ffgs0m5,t3_et6tei,1579913576.0,Why!?
StartledCats,ffd11ll,t3_espp24,1579811309.0,Oh that was WAY better than I expected.

ShitMomGroupsSay,ffcznxf,t3_esvit9,1579810546.0,"As a former nanny and current stay at home mom let me just say watching kids is hard as hell. They poop their pants, have minds of their own, they eat constantly, they are super messy as far as regular people go. There are so many things you have to do for them that end up taking up a large portion of the time you spend watching over them. They can be jerks. They DO NOT ""sleep all day"". I have heard comments about how easy being a nanny must be or how it's not a real job but mostly from people who dont have children. It makes me wonder how much time this mother actually spends with her children. Childcare needs to be thought of as the job it is, a real, oftentimes difficult, job and the people who do said job need proper pay."
terriblefacebookmemes,ffa69my,t3_esapt1,1579728701.0,This is actually really fucking annoying. You can at least pull your carts out of the way to have a conversation instead of block up the entire aisle. I say this as I have to parade 3 children around the grocery store and that's hard enough without road blocks.
Mommit,ff7214g,t1_ff70ugw,1579639547.0,Right!? This might be from that Jimmy Kimmel gig he does every year. He asks the parents to tell their kids they ate all kids Halloween candy and video tape the reaction. Then he makes a compilation on his show.
nosleep,fetjx58,t3_eqgoz2,1579376160.0,Wait... how did he know what the boy's voice sounded ik?
terriblefacebookmemes,ferk5s7,t3_eq9zeb,1579354929.0,This is hilarious.
terriblefacebookmemes,fekbil1,t1_fejota1,1579196590.0,Because there is an entire aging generation who doesn't understand the internet.
terriblefacebookmemes,fejrvuz,t1_fejgeqi,1579184316.0,All the upvotes to this English teacher.
TwoXChromosomes,fehgy61,t1_feh8ypr,1579116318.0,Me too! My husband had paternity leave for our youngest 2 and I'll tell you I would have lost my mind had he not taken it seriously. I dont think you can gloat at the chaos that ensues when you bring your 3rd child home though. He also had to hold down the fort while I was in the hospital. I thank my lucky stars.
TwoXChromosomes,fehgp0q,t3_ep3td0,1579116169.0,"It seems so many of them think very little of mothers as well. How many times I've read ""you're not special because you let someone cum in you"" on this platform is disgusting. It makes my hands sweat. It's an insult to all women not just mothers. Theres no equivalent phrase to downplay the role a father plays because fathers are held on a pedestal just for being fathers. Regardless of how much parenting they actually do."
Mommit,feh78fs,t3_eos144,1579110601.0,"I get this way around people who dont respect me, yet want to win over my kids and husband. I dont leave the room though I stand my ground. I'll swoop in and take my baby back the second I feel my wishes aren't being heard."
StartledCats,fegpoxh,t3_eopxgi,1579099591.0,"I love the ""WTF was that!?"" Pause just after the backflip."
curlygirl,fegougi,t3_ep1ouk,1579098999.0,Yes it will. The transition period is your hair getting used to not being washed as much (being a little oily for awhile) and repairing itself from heat damage. Once you stop using heat and silicones completely your hair will begin to repair itself and in turn get curlier. Hair gets dry from heat damage and silicone keeps it from taking on the moisture it needs to heal. I dont think curly girl is something you can do on the weekends and still see progress. Personally I'm a SAHM so transition wasn't a big deal for me but lots of people just wear their hair up for several weeks until it starts to look a bit better.
thisismylifenow,fee20wi,t1_fec2up8,1579024752.0,It's like a pupper mom group.

Mommit,fedjf2v,t1_fecdeq7,1579013043.0,Right? I know it's been on for 5 straight hours. It is what it is.
