Again, Carson is not a dummy.

Very well respected in the medical community.

As a pioneer in neurosurgery, Carson's achievements include performing the only successful separation of conjoined twins joined at the back of the head; performing the first successful neurosurgical procedure on a fetus inside the womb; performing the first completely successful separation of type-2 vertical craniopagus twins; developing new methods to treat brain-stem tumors; and revitalizing hemispherectomy techniques for controlling seizures.

nfl,fekqt5k,t1_fek7s0v,1579205696.0,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Payton's offense. The routes are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of football most of the offensive schemes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Payton's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his play calling- his personal football philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. Thomas understands this stuff; he has the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these plays, to realise that they're not just complicated- they say something deep about FOOTBALL. As a consequence people who dislike Thomas truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the nuance in Thomas's existential catchphrase ""SHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Paramount's epic ""A Quiet Place"". I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Sean Payton's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens.
