ThunderBay,fffpn81,t3_etavgd,1579889070.0,"Most young people I've met here seem to think that Thunder Bay sucks. I think this is a pretty common opinion amongst anyone that spends their whole life in a city. I've lived in several cities in the US and Canada and travelled through hundreds (maybe even thousands). Thunder Bay isn't too bad. There's low traffic, it has most amenities, large art/craft community, transit generally works (could use improvements though), and lots of nearby nature. Crime seems to be the only fair criticism but even that seems to be only within certain social communities/groups rather than widespread, things like homicides are pretty much always solved."

EatCheapAndHealthy,fffg4km,t1_fffa5vr,1579883220.0,">Maple syrup, at least the stuff we get in the states, is generally disgusting.

The fake stuff is usually called ""breakfast syrup"" or something like that, aunt Jemima is a common one down there I think. Real maple syrup is awesome but can be expensive. 

I made some myself a couple Winters ago and for a while anytime I wanted to feel real fancy I'd do a maple glaze on some salmon or similar type of fish. Because I cooked the maple syrup myself over a wood fire (fun fact 40litres of sap makes 1litre of syrup) it had a nice smoky taste. Not as good for pancakes but great for fish or pork."

mississauga,ffcl5o7,t1_ffchch3,1579801790.0,"Funnily enough, that's how I would describe some people born into wealthy families.

Let's see, I got my first job at 15, have no debt, volunteered throughout my life, and also have cycled across Canada for charity. But sure, I have done nothing of value and have no real accomplishments. I'm a regular leach upon society. 

I think your problem is that you assume that anyone who thinks we should give options to poor people only wants it to benefit for themselves rather than being able to acknowledge the possibility that they want society to improve somewhat. What I am suggesting is that we surround people with good role models and good opportunities. Raise someone with those and 9 times out of 10 they'll go on to be hardworking and contributing members of society. Shuttle them off to a ghetto with little hope and few good role models, and they'll do exactly what you expect."
ontario,ffckiha,t1_ffcgycj,1579801398.0,"The only option I know of for this particular change would be to give municipalities constitutional rights. That would require support from most provinces and the majority of people to happen. Currently municipalities have essentially 0 rights beyond what a province gives them. They're called ""creatures of the province"" and totally under their control. So unless the federal and provincial governments decide to make that change to the constitution, there's basically no way to do it.

Also if that happens, a conservative mayor/council could just make the changes themselves. Our only practical option is to ensure that conservatives understand that doing this will lose them votes. 

It's good for a government to be able to make cuts to programs or move money from one area to another. Overspending/misspending is not a good thing. It's cuts with the intention to get them to fail or to place the benefits of corporations over the needs of the people that are the problem."
mississauga,ffc88im,t3_esrqs8,1579793792.0,"There was a study in the US in which poor people were given housing vouchers allowing them to live in wealthier neighbourhoods. The adults tended to do the same economically, sometimes even worse than the control group which stayed in poorer neighbourhoods. The project lasted around 10 years or so and in that time the teenagers that had moved had time to grow up and get jobs. They were actually worse off generally speaking, they had tended to act out more during school and didn't really have higher rates of post-secondary attendance. The project was scrapped and considered a failure. They kept collecting data though and later on researchers looked into it and learned that those that moved into these wealthier neighbourhoods as kids did much, much better than control groups. Higher rates of university, better jobs, healthier.

Less than a 5 minute bus ride if you're on an ideal route or 5minutes by bus + 10 minutes of walking for pretty unideal circumstances. If you're driving that distance it'll take several minutes to get there and several more to find parking/get to the station. So that's 10 minutes by car vs 15 minutes for unideal walk+transit combination vs 25 minutes by foot. 

When you factor in the price of transit which is $0.80 if you transfer on to GO transit comes out on top of you're within 2km of a GO station like 1/3 of people. This is obviously not aimed at you but aimed at all the people that live close by but take their car because it's free."

If you think that having a bike would be necessary to actually experience nature out there, then that definitely makes me lean towards cycling."
ontario,feeuz0g,t1_feeuimb,1579041780.0,I've been thinking of heading up there in the summer for some seasonal work. I like Thunder Bay but I want to be I'd like to be in a smaller town with more nature come summer time. Any insight into what it's like up there without a car?
