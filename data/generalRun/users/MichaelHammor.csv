I decided to set up a sting on my daughter. I set my phone alarm to vibrate and woke up a bit early. I was on the couch and my kid was in her crib in the same room. I pretended to sleep but watched through slitted eyes. She stood up and stared at me trying to make sure I was really asleep. Satisfied, she ninja flipped over the side of the crib and hit the carpet in a crouch. She then ran to her toy box and chucked a few toys into the crib. not one of them missed! She then ran back to the crib and ninja flipped back into it.
