Maybe I'll make a full post to discuss this, but I find that the general public rates horror movies very low when it doesn't hit their personal tastes, but can give an 8/10 for an Oscar-bait boring art film even though they hated watching it. Horror is difficult to do well simply because it comes from a place of the unknown and unseen. I think this sub does a pretty good job, but more people need to search for what they like in horror rather than totally write a movie off because they ""hate jump scares"" or ""found the ending corny"".
