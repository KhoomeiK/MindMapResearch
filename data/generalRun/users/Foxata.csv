Also; the snake is dead, so while still technically cruel this ain't animal abuse."

AmItheAsshole,fal5pci,t3_e9ny7c,1576178835.0,"I think you are NTA, it must be tough dealing with a sensitivity to that extend. I don't know how you could deal inside your house, but maybe you can compromise by covering the mask up with a scarf. That way your parents don't have to be ""embarrassed"" when you walk outside. 

Also maybe get it checked out in the hospital just so you can prove to your parents how bad it really is. Life is all about compromise, but sometimes you have to stand your ground if you want be comfortable in your own skin."
