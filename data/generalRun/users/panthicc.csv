YouShouldKnow,ffi71o1,t1_ffhnl2n,1579966784.0,"What I think probably happened was that Outline was disabling/overwriting the code on the publication URL that was responsible for the paywall, or possibly just disabling JS all together.

But Outline became very popular very quickly and these publications caught wind and started slapping them with cease and desists and threatening them with lawsuits.

That, or these publications modified their paywall code to run server side instead of client side, so Outline could no longer modify it."

KingdomHearts,fffnrcu,t1_fff77zl,1579887917.0,"For me it looks off mostly because Roxas's model in the bottom frame looks very stiff. In the top frame you can tell he's ""expressing"" and there's movement in his body, but in the bottom frame it kinda just looks like a default T-pose."

I've been sitting behind a computer screen for the last 11 years. I really want a career shift involving field work."
YouShouldKnow,ffffwf2,t1_fffbawp,1579883082.0,">I'm not supporting the Drudge Report, Tomi Lahren, or Rush Limbuagh. But  I'll gladly pay for a subscription to Propublica, NYT, and WaPo. 

Six of one, half-dozen of the other. 

Why not directly support great journalists who are doing actual reporting instead of paying *any* biased, agenda-driven corporation to feed Americans propaganda? The reporters who work for those publications aren't allowed to do real reporting even if they wanted to. They're forced to write about what their marketing directors and CEOs tell them to in order to generate the most clicks.

I have no qualms bypassing MSM outlets. The sooner they fail, the sooner we can see independent journalism take off in a significant way."
YouShouldKnow,fffegvw,t1_fff6oen,1579882184.0,"Yeah, Outline was my go-to... for about 2 weeks until every news outlet started blocking it. I'm sure it'll be the same for the site in OP before long."
YouShouldKnow,ffcao7w,t1_ffbtnpm,1579795336.0,"This is how mine is too, but there's also no expiration date on it. There's what looks like a ""best if used by"" sticker, but it's blank."
California,ff83vvk,t1_ff81qcl,1579665300.0,Why so much more destructive recently though? For past few years it seemed like every one of our wildfires was consecutively breaking records. Have those winds just been particularly more fierce in recent years? Is that something pretty unique to California?
California,ff824uj,t1_ff81eea,1579663997.0,"No, just that their wildfires haven't been as widespread, destructive, or long-term as ours have been."
California,ff7zi2r,t1_ff7f9fc,1579662093.0,"If the issue was budgetary though, wouldn't states like Idaho, Oregon, and Utah be having similar issues?"
YouShouldKnow,ff3hala,t1_ff2yof1,1579541015.0,"Checking out some of the recent issues, it looks like the developer hasn't updated this in a while and it's no longer working for some major publications, but the project is being continued [here](https://github.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean)."
California,fdqm978,t1_fdqbsl8,1578670021.0,Is it true that a lot of folks in Boise hate Californians and are trying to prevent us from moving there? Or is that overblown?
California,fdphy34,t1_fdnyhtz,1578629107.0,"We've got our eye on a few spots, but we're hoping to get the chance to travel domestically this year to see if somewhere really strikes our fancy. I'm honestly more concerned with finding somewhere we *want* to live than finding somewhere to work.

So far we've been looking at North Carolina (Charlotte or the Research Triangle), Texas (San Antonio), and Idaho (Boise).

I'm sure your husband can find work just about anywhere, doesn't necessarily have to be any kind of tech hub. We live on the Central Coast and tech jobs aren't exactly a dime a dozen here like in the Bay Area, so I figure if I can find work here, I can find it anywhere. :)"
California,fdos882,t1_fdoq6an,1578611717.0,"I dunno, the market looks pretty hot in [Idaho](https://www.zillow.com/id/home-values/)! Better than [California](https://www.zillow.com/ca/home-values/), anyway.

But assuming you can afford to buy a house in SF, more power to you. That ain't me lol."
California,fdo5hu2,t1_fdo35dg,1578599245.0,"I don't live in the Bay Area, so my salary is already significantly less, haha. My employer has offered to let me work remotely if I move out of state, which is the other nice benefit of tech. :) 

But honestly, taking a cursory glance at some of the job boards in areas I'm looking at, salaries are about the same or even better than what I'm earning now, so even without that safety net, I'm optimistic on the job front.

Keep in mind too that your money goes a lot further outside the Bay Area. You can buy a home with a $60-70k salary in Idaho. In SF, that's practically poverty."
California,fdnvocu,t1_fdnqgdw,1578593785.0,"Web dev and adjacent.

I know what folks are probably thinking, but hear me out. When I say ""better"" opportunities, I'm taking into consideration things like work/life balance, salary:cost of living ratio, competition, job security, etc.

So I might not be earning a Bay Area salary, but I'm not worried about finding solid work in my field.

Edit: Phrasing"
California,fdngewl,t3_emadfc,1578585255.0,"Born and raised in California, but we're out as soon as our current lease is up. I can work in practically any other state for the same salary I'm making now, have better job opportunities in my field, for a fraction of the cost of living. 

Love the weather and the family's here, but things aren't getting better for the working class and politicians are only exacerbating the existing crises. We just can't justify it anymore."
