>To write a feature smaller than the Airy disk into the light-sensitive photoresist material used for photolithography, first direct a focused 800 nm wavelength laser beam onto the unpolymerized storage medium. This light causes the photoresist to polymerize where the intensity of the light is sufficiently large to release the polymerization activators. To release enough activators, the light intensity must be above a threshold value, with the polymer spot size becoming smaller as the peak intensity of the 800 nm light is reduced"

Frat,fezmr8g,t1_fez8wkh,1579459097.0,"It's more of a question of whether it bothers you. Your actives won't really care. I would say go for it, especially since you usually can't drink for most of your pledging semester anyway so you can kill two birds with one stone."
