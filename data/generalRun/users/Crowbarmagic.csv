thenetherlands,ffmm5us,t1_ffmeqd8,1580056561.0,"Ik heb vroeger nog gehad dat de winkelier mij Half-Life niet wilde verkopen, want er stond 18+ op de doos. Volgens mij was de game in Nederlands eigenlijk geclassificeerd als 16+ of iets , maar sinds er op de doos (die ouderwetse grote kartonnen) iets ander stond wilde hij geen risico lopen.

Ik weet nog dat ik en mijn vriend dat erg grappig vonden, want buiten het feit dat er nog nooit moeilijk was gedaan over de leeftijdsgrens, was dit **ergens rond 2006**, en Half-Life was grafisch al hopeloos verouderd. Het zag er al totaal niet meer schokkend uit doordat iedereen veel betere graphics gewend was. Een beetje alsof je een oude film kijkt met verouderde special effects die vroeger misschien schokkend waren, maar waar de kijker vandaag de dag om lacht.

Dit was overigens niet een game speciaal zaak of een speelgoed winkel, maar in een electronica zaak die in een hoekje een klein assortiment aan games had. Verklaard misschien waarom de winkelier het zo serieus nam: Hij verkoopt misschien zelden games, en vooral niet aan jonge tieners. Het was namelijk totaal *niet* een winkel waar je heen zou gaan voor de games. De helft van het games assortiment bestond uit oude B-games (die allemaal maar een tientje ofzo kosten) en werk simulators uit Duitsland. Ze hadden zelden de nieuwe releases ofzo. De verkoop van games was duidelijk een kleine bijzaak voor deze winkel. Iets waar ze de klanten die net een desktop van ze hebben gekocht nog even op wijzen. 'Bedankt voor uw aankoop! Oja, we hebben daar nog wat computerspelletjes staan. Misschien dat er iets leuks bij zit voor op uw nieuwe computer!'.

Verklaard ook waarom ze nog Half-Life verkochten (en in de ouderwetse doos no less) in 2006. Winkels die zich meer of puur op games richten hadden die schapruimte al lang gebruikt voor modernere titels. Het gekke was wel weer: Eens in de zoveel tijd hadden ze wel iets speciaals. Ik wilde graag de HL2 Collector's edition en die was schijnbaar vrij zeldzaam want de game speciaal zaken in mijn buurt hadden ze niet (ze waren meer op consoles gefocused). De enige winkel die ze wel had? Die electronica zaak. Hoe en waarom heeft de winkel die geen kut om games geeft die collectors box wel, en die hebben de specialisten ze niet?:P"

You are basically a mass murderer if you count all the sacrificed clones, and the game kinda tries to make you aware of this fact. 

But I kinda digressed here. I just thought the story wasn't that deep. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle platformers, but not to people who are looking for some great story experience.

The Japanese also had a really big submarine in WW2, the I-400 class. It was kinda like they welded submarines together to build it. The reason it was so big was because it was a freaking **submarine aircraft carrier**. It could sneak in under water, surface, and launch planes from the deck with this catapult-like system. To get back in they had a crane (the planes were specially adjusted seaplanes, so they would land in the water and taxi towards the sub).

It didn't turned out to be effective though. 1 I-400 could only hold IIRC 3 planes, and with conventional bombs and the (lack of) accuracy of the bombing back then... Not a game changer. However, the concept of it was terrifying. If it carried like biological weapons or had more precise ways of bombing... It really was something new.

Not disagreeing with your overall point by the way. Just saying that I do believe they wanted the movie to be slightly funnier."
MovieDetails,ffchesq,t1_ffar99u,1579799517.0,"It would be far from the first time a movie comes out pretty differently than the writer and/or directors imagined. 

A bit like that saying 'a battle plan never survives the first skirmish'. That's not exactly it, but the point is that no big project with that many variables (almost) never goes exactly to plan. Same with movies. You might have some vision but it turns out differently. Sometimes for the good, and sometimes for the bad."
MovieDetails,ffcgoh0,t1_ffbydi9,1579799066.0,"The thing about the agents is: I feel like they should act and look like these nameless g-men. Like how I guess most of us would picture the most boring uninspired look of a FBI agent. They are basically copies of each other with slight variations (only in later movies they specifically said ""Smith"" was a unique program. In the original movie he was just the main guy of the ""Agent"" program).

I guess my point is: Although I think Jean Reno could've worked out great as well, he often stands out a bit more if get know what I'm saying. At least more than Hugo Weaving. I really liked how all the agents looked like similar no-name suits, and he was perfect to play that part.

If they didn't get Lawrence Fishburne, I think Jean Reno would've made a great Morpheus actually! I think that role would fit him better than Agent Smith."
MovieDetails,ffceu36,t1_ffbddi7,1579797938.0,"I don't hate on it but I wouldn't recommend it either. There were some jokes I thought worked well, but others that fell completely flat (or really weren't jokes at all, but just references to modern day stuff). And the plot is pretty thin, which doesn't help.

I guess it kinda felt like watching a lot of comedy skits in the end, and not so much a movie. There's only so many times that someone crudely unexpectedly dying is funny."

TIHI,ffcda98,t1_ffbqjjo,1579796974.0,"There was an apartment building here in which basically the same happened. Instead of throwing it out, people left unused stuff in the lobby for others to potentially use.

Unfortunately, last New Year some kids threw some fireworks in the lobby, a couch caught fire, and 3 people died in a stuck elevator. No more storing stuff in the lobby."

Not that having sound adds *that* much with this video, but part of figure skating is dancing to the music, so it's nice to hear that too. Plus hearing the air whooshing by the camera's microphone gives more of a sense of the speed she skates at."

So yeah, if I e.g. was a cashier that stole money, they would give a negative advice for a position that requires me to handle money. Anything else though, and they would probably give the green light."

Ja, je wordt vanalles gegeven maar je hebt gewoon geen normaal leven, en je moet overal in het land komen om proberen enthousiast te zijn over de opening van bv. een nieuwe bibliotheek. En alles wat je doet wordt in de media breed uitgemeten.

Dus daar staan je dan maar met (misschien je favouriete) stropdas, en je moet maar meedoen. Ik durf ook te wedden dat een boel leden van het koningshuis het volkslied helemaal spuugzat zijn. Iedereen heeft zich wel eens geërgerd aan een nummer omdat je het te vaak hebt gehoord toch? Deze mensen ontkomen hun hele leven lang niet aan hetzelfde liedje."
