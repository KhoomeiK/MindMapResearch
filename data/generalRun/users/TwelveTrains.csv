Behavior is R6S represents a world that is not reality. And it is enabled as such because these people face no consequences for their actions in the game."

Rainbow6,ffmm402,t3_etstpl,1580056537.0,"I don't understand bans.

Bans are supposedly to get rid of a 'meta' or overuse of a character. People will just assume you will always ban that one character and default to the 2nd best character. Meta will always exist, just let me play all the characters I paid for and stop wasting so much time in the beginning of the game with the ban phase. I'd rather be playing the game than banning."
Rainbow6,ffml2w1,t1_ffmigqr,1580056152.0,"To address your points:

1. Try re-phrasing this, I have no idea what you are talking about.


2. I never said I understand that behavior. I said ""I understand this type of behavior can exist in any game or anywhere on the internet."" This means I recognize this type of behavior exists outside of R6S. I then went on to say that the prevalence of this behavior in R6S compared with other games and other areas of the internet is disturbingly high. I made this pretty clear. You can't just add a full stop after the word 'behavior' to change the meaning of my sentences.


3. This can be changed so that players DO get punished.


4. I play this game for fun too. What would make you think I don't? Getting systematically teamkilled/teamwounded/kicked and verbally abused every game isn't my idea of a good time. This has no place in any gamemode whether it is casual, unranked, or ranked. The amount of people in this thread defending this behavior sickens me.


5. This will never make me stop standing up for what is right."

I make 48k a year. This puts me in the top 2% of all wealthiest people in the world. In the United States it means I am somewhere in the middle.



Right now, all I can afford is a $400 Seiko Turtle. This is .83% of my annual income.


The cost of a Rolex Submariner is about 8.5k. To afford this watch at .83% of my annual income I would need to make $1,024,000 a year. This income would put me at the top .009% of people in the world, and the top 1% of earners in the U.S."

It would be up to Ubisoft on what they want to implement. Action is required. Ubisoft needs to do something, whether it is one or more of my recommendations or one or more of their own.


Saying things like 'ear rape' is completely different and you know it. I have been threatened with real sexual violence in game more times than I can count. That has no place in any video game and deserves a permanent ban, end of story.

Teamkilling is rarely, if ever, accidental. Maybe 5% of the time. Teamkilling is used by toxic players to demonstrate power over their victims or used by groups to gang up on a solo-queuer. Right now its primary function is to enable these disgusting people. Imagine if friendly fire was on all the time for all players. You would still have to be careful about not hitting your teammates (to achieve the realism goal of friendly fire) but you would only punish yourself if you abused it. I think always on reverse friendly fire is a much preferable solution to what we have now."

Watches,fe0c0pj,t1_fe0b73e,1578809257.0,"Here's where there is a disconnect between the value you perceive and the function that Seiko provides. If you are basing your opinions based on videos and hearsay, how can you judge anything at all? I would caution you regarding this. To address your points:

1. Pin and collar systems are by far my favorite link adjustment type. I've worked with all of them. Pins without collars can slip. Screws require loctite to seal properly so adding/removing links is a bit of a pain and require heat-sealing. Pin and collars are very thin, easy to adjust, and 100% secure.

2. Seiko doesn't offer on-the-fly microadjust but only Rolex and Omega have done this in the last 10 years. Many top brands like Breitling, Grand Seiko, others offer NO microadjust, even basic microadjust. Thank Seiko for usually offering 4 well-spaced microadjust holes in their clasps.


3. I have owned many watches with stamped clamps and forged clasps. I *much* prefer stamped. They are always lower profile and less bulky, which means a helluva lot more comfortable. So many forged clasps dig into my wrist and protrude ever so slightly from the clasp housing. Stamped are always flush and they keep the weight down, which also adds to comfort.


People bash Seiko for the strangest things on reddit and I really try to make an attempt to educate. Often times, it is people who have never owned the watches or spent any significant time with them. I have bought and sold many watches in my day, probably 20 of which were Seikos.

I see criticisms so often, criticisms that have no basis in function or anything that is able to be defined. People might not like something because it ""feels cheap"". But they can't actually tell you specifically why it is inferior."
