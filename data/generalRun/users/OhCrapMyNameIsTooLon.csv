todayilearned,feipndf,t1_feip6gy,1579144097.0,"In 2017 cryptocurrency was so hyped and almost everyone in the crypto(Bitcoin etc.) was feeling euphoric. You would have almost everyone buying whatever they can and actually profit from it. Now before my investment actually exploded I did pitch the coin/ project to a lot of my friends because I thought it’d be a game changer in the crypto scene.

Besides that, at that point everyone was talking about it and everyone showed what they had and believed would be the next big thing. I think I told 3-4 people, just because I was so euphoric too, I thought I was going to be so rich. And it was really impressive for my circle of friends.

 I guess people would just say “I know a guy that has .....” whenever the subject landed on cryptocurrency and before you know  everyone is aware of the fact that you have a lot of money. I also live in a relatively small city (50k people) so word travels fast, especially when you’re young and the average 21 y/o has only €500 in the bank"
todayilearned,feio3zi,t1_feink1n,1579143067.0,"Well, I did in fact give a lot of gifts to my friends. But even then you have friends who would distance themselves from you because other people out of jealousy would start staying they’re just hanging out with you because you’re buying them gifts or paying for everything. And trust me that hurts more than you think.

I’ve had one of my friends distance themselves from me and his reason was:” I just don’t want people to think I’m one of the people taking advantage of you.”

So even if they are your best friends, keep your mouth shut at all times. Money DOES change people, it makes people fantasize about being in your shoes thinking: “ If I was that rich, I’d buy my friends a new car. But he doesn’t give me anything, even when he knows I am not making that much money, what a greedy bastard.” Even your parents can change and expect you to pay for stuff just because you’re their kid and got lucky.

I think winning the lottery would be very heavy on your mental health. (I’m not a native speaker so sorry for my grammar etc)"
todayilearned,feimu03,t1_feimmid,1579142217.0,"Also, I don’t know how to edit on your phone. But people can relate less to your problems. They think: “Dude, why are u sad u have so much money don’t be sad.” Also, I think it’s never good to tell people you won and the first thing I would do is contact someone who can control your finances or you could lose it all like I did"
todayilearned,feimmid,t1_feiip9h,1579142077.0,"I don’t know, I am certainly not a lottery winner but I did get extremely lucky in 2017 with cryptocurrency. 

I was 21 and got $400k on a $3k investment. I never had more than $6K in my bank ever and I didn’t even have a job at the time. I was foolish and told people because I just didn’t know how to handle such amount of money.

I lost almost all of my friends because a lot of them started asking a lot of favors or just taking advantage of me. When they know you have a lot of money they start assuming a lot of things especially when they feel $50 $100 is nothing to u and they start treating u different. Sometimes they don’t even realize they do it, they just feel intimidated by it and they can’t help it.

Anyways, people would gossip and they have actually tried to break in a couple of times in my (moms) house. I think it’s very dependent on who is in your circle. 

Anyways, I lost almost everything so I’m not trying to brag, that’s just how it went for me."

ledgerwallet,fcivdez,t1_fcg6iqo,1577670720.0,"My seeds are safe, somewhere, it's just that I've hid it so well the last time I hid it, I don't remember where exactly, it can happen to all of us. Especially because you don't want to write down a clue somewhere. Actually, I made split up the recovery phrase in two and hid in two separate places, because I was too paranoid someone would find it. I am indeed a moron, but back in the day with such a large sum of money ( to me ) I did all I could to protect it, because I would sure as hell lose a paper wallet, lol.  


Anyways, my point was that I freaked out because it wasn't working, but turns out the cable(s) I was using didn't work with the ledger, but after making a few calls, I finally got one from an acquaintance and the coins are finally safe and the ledger + recovery seed have been reset."
ledgerwallet,fcg1mje,t1_fcfylh8,1577635666.0,"Because besides 5 BTC it also has a little over 3K NEO on it, and the thing is back in the day (end of 2017) the general concensus was: ""If it's on an exchange it's not your coins, use a ledger"" so here I am, wishing I had done the exact opposite.."
