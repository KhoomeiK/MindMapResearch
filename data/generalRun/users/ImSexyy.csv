WiggleButts,fetteip,t1_fetqyyh,1579379855.0,"We feed her raw. I’m not really sure how the wigglebutt community feels about feeding raw so I won’t speak much on the topic, but it has helped her in many ways. 

She doesn’t shed as much which is great, and her coat is healthier/shinier/softer. She gets a lot of compliments now!

Edit: changed wording"
WiggleButts,fet5ssy,t3_eq9opr,1579372095.0,"We usually tell our groomer to leave her coat be (very slight trim). The main things we have them focus on his her wiggle butt region, backs of her legs, around the neck/ears and her paws. We get her groomed maybe 2-3 times a year. Since we switched her diet her coat is so much healthier now."
rawpetfood,fesq6bo,t3_eqj64j,1579367865.0,"Turkey necks are great for your doggo’s teeth thanks to it’s fibrous tissue. It’ll also provide her some mental stimulation and a challenge (though she can house this down in about 5 minutes). The chovy is great for the gut as well as the seaweed blend, which has a lot of other nutrients in it.

She gets a turkey next twice a week, which will help keep her teeth clean."
rawpetfood,fecm2td,t3_eo5ilo,1578977278.0,"The best thing to do when your dog has diarrhea is fast him/her. Skip a meal, let their tummy reset and start fresh the next day. My dog is the queen of diarrhea and tummy sensitivity. When done right, the raw has been so incredible for her. However, sometimes she still has episodes. We find that she handles turkey grinds best; we call it her staple protein. She can have it mixed with another protein or alone. Any other protein we’ve tried has to be mixed with turkey.

Since you’re new to raw, I suggest fasting your dog and then introducing one protein. Turkey is nice and lean, so maybe start there. After a few days/a week you should be able to introduce another protein. 

We usually give our dog two proteins, a seaweed blend (great for their digestive tracts) and an anchovy (also recommend for a happy tummy). 

Some people are suggesting rice and chicken. Please do not feed your dog rice! Fasting and starting at a slower pace (with one protein) should do the trick."

rawpetfood,fdnc5wp,t3_em9cgp,1578582622.0,"Turkey and rabbit are really great, lean meats. We feed our dog a combination because she had some weight to lose. You can also get beef, but it has a slightly higher fat percentage. 

Maybe stick with Turkey and Rabbit first."
rawpetfood,fdcvakl,t3_eknn4w,1578285324.0,"Please make sure you’re not feeding your dog cooked bones! It’s extremely dangerous as it breaks up into shards when cooked and can cut up their throats and stomachs. 

You don’t really need to feed him veggies, and eggs can be fed whole (shell and all, uncooked). Quail eggs are really great if you’re interested in continuing with that. 

Your pup will need a variety of proteins in his diet. Chicken is good, but I’d also recommend incorporating proteins like rabbit, lamb, turkey or beef. You can alternate between 3-4 proteins or mix them. You should also be including some sort of fish; we like to feed our dog an anchovy/mackerel/sardine with every meal. 

For those superfoods we have a seaweed blend that we sprinkle on top; it’s packed full of minerals and nutrients an helps with digestion.

Your dog should actually drink less when fed raw, so it seems something isn’t quite working. Since he’s a puppy it’s really important to provide a balanced diet.

Since you’re new at this I just wanted to give some advice. If you’re concerned about the frequent urination your best bet is to consult a vet, just expect them to talk you out of feeding raw if you tell them."
rawpetfood,fdcmin4,t3_ekl7ja,1578278602.0,"About 90% of your dog’s diet should be meat/protein-based. A variety of protein is very important, so this is what you want to focus on... here is what we give our dog currently (as a reference):

3 proteins: Turkey, lamb and beef grinds - Grinds are nice because they contain all parts of the animal and it’s easier to feed/clean up. We will be adding rabbit soon as it is a very rich and healthy protein.

She gets 10 oz a day, 4 oz of protein (we usually mix 50/50 turkey and beef/lamb) and one anchovy per meal (you can switch it up too by getting sardines, mackerel, salmon roe, etc.) We also add a seaweed blend which provides a lot of superfood ingredients (just enough) and minerals. 

Twice a week we will supplement a meal with a meaty bone. Currently she gets a turkey neck (10oz roughly), but we’ll be looking into lamb ribs/neck or pork neck. These are great for teeth cleaning and added stimulation. 

It is best to start off with one protein to get your dog acclimated to the new diet. If your dog is sensitive, I’d recommend starting with the same protein as their kibble. You’ll want to fast your dog for 24 hours before feeding the first meal (unless you have a puppy... do not fast if you have a puppy). Have at least two proteins on hand to start, this way after a few days you can incorporate a new one (if all goes well that is. We waited a week before introducing a new protein, but our dog is very sensitive)."
Pets,fca7p25,t1_fca59v5,1577564304.0,"Yeah, I understand completely and your concern is valid. The wrong fit could actually affect OP negatively, so I think she needs to proceed with caution no matter what she decides (for her mental health)."
Pets,fc9xvnx,t1_fc9ti38,1577559836.0,"I presented OP with a number of options, and it is ultimately her decision what she wants to do. I did mention that caring for a kitten is a lot of work and she might not want that responsibility. I do agree it is risk in that you don’t know how they will be as an adult, but it’s equally as risky adopting a shelter dog.... even as an adult, shelter dogs require a lot of work. She might not want to handle that responsibility either. I just think raising up a kitten can make a difference in how they are as adults, that’s all."
Pets,fc9kisu,t3_egqctz,1577554018.0,"I think you have a few options here: 

Adopting a kitten is nice because you can ‘raise it’ up if you will. I adopted my cat when he was 3 months old. He turned out to be a dog trapped in a cat’s body. Loves to cuddle, always greets me at the door when I get home, follows me around. He’s a total Mama’s boy.

This is a good option, but I also think there are plenty of adult cats in shelters that are sweet and cuddly by nature (if you don’t want the responsibility of raising a kitten... it can be fun, but it’s a lot of work). 

For dogs, like many suggest, any breed can be suitable for you. I always recommend checking out shelter dogs, but you should know their personalities aren’t always true up front. Shelter dogs also come with a lot of behavioral issues that will require work. A lot of times they were strays, abused, abandoned, etc. Our dog is from a shelter and she was a mess when we got her, but it turns out she was the perfect fit for us. I struggle with anxiety, and she does too. We’ve been able to form this special bond and lean on each other because we both struggle with the same thing. She’s come so far and it has been the most rewarding experience.

Again, if you’re not up for the extra work and risk of adopting a shelter dog (which is totally understandable), there is nothing wrong with adopting from a breeder so long as you choose the right one.  

One more thing... your feelings are completely valid. It’s normal to feel guilt when thinking of adopting another pet when you currently have one OR one passes. When we adopted our dog I would love on my cat so much, and I would always tell myself he would always be my #1 baby (otherwise I’d feel so guilty). Now? I love them both equally, but for different reasons. It’s okay to feel this way, but know your heart will be so full when you adopt again, and your first baby will always be with you no matter what.

Best of luck to you!"

aww,fc7vg5s,t1_fc7t9l1,1577519672.0,"Our dog is the same way, so I completely understand! It has taken a lot of work to get her where she is today, but even still she has her moments.

It takes time and patience, but you’ll get there!"
aww,fc7t0bg,t1_fc7knnh,1577517875.0,"Oh no! I mean, it’s good your dog checks in, but ‘excessive’ check-ins isn’t exactly what you want either. Maybe look into training methods that will help with this if it’s becoming a problem! 

She definitely doesn’t think you’re an idiot though; she’s just looking for guidance! It’s like her form of communication with you."
aww,fc79rue,t3_egisn6,1577501300.0,"Check-ins are good! He/she sees you as the leader of the pack, and they check in to make sure they are still performing good behavior and to see what they need to do next... it’s their way of communicating with you, which is pretty cool!

Our dog does the same thing with us and we never had to train her to do it either, which is nice!

Dogs that do this are usually easier to train; they just want to please their humans!

Pets,fc3gsdp,t3_efzm63,1577389464.0,"I spent maybe 4-5k on my cat when he was only 2 years old (I was 18 at the time) from back-to-back health issues. He had a blockage which almost killed him, and a week later he developed asthma. I had to apply for Care Credit because I was in college and no one in my family could help me. I blew through my savings since the credit limit couldn’t cover all of the expenses. I’d do it again in a heartbeat if I had to. He’s going to be 10 now and we’ve since adopted a dog. 

I would do anything for them, no matter what. I know what I signed up for when adopting them; it’s my responsibility to care for them financially. After he got sick I ended up getting pet insurance just in case anything happens to him (unrelated to his current health issues since it’s pre-existing). Both our babies are covered now, and that helps put my mind at ease."
