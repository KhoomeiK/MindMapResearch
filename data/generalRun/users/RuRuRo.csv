Bernie is going to owe Bloomberg, “something, that’s how it works.” Wrong. That is how it works for everyone OTHER than Bernie. If Bloomberg chooses to spend his money to help Bernie’s campaign, “Bernie can’t stop him”, like Ryan Grim said. Bloomberg would be doing it to hurt Trump’s campaign.

Bernie has been running a grassroots funded campaign. If Bloomberg came looking for a favor in return Bernie would remind him of that fact, and that it was Bloomberg’s personal choice. Bernie is not going to flip on his campaign strategy and supporters and go against what he feels about big money’s special interests. If you believe that then you are not hearing his campaign message and do not understand what his campaign is all about. US!"
