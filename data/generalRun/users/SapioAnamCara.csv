What we think and feel leads us to how we behave and if that is not synchronized then there is a therapy for that (Cognitive Behavior Therapy). We do possess traumas and emotional pain and that affects the body by physiological means by raising of cortisol levels relating to stress and an increase of blood pressure.

It is not easy to break bad habits or self-sabotaging beliefs but if only we could recognize them and be aware of them, then perhaps that would be a good start. There are too many people with mental illnesses these days and it has become a sociological phenomenon aside from it being a psychological phenomenon.

People have traumas and were abused in their past and they were taught or told how worthless they are or how unloved they are and these words were repeated until they unconsciously internalized these beliefs and they believed them themselves. It is a vicious cycle where they are start believing that they do not deserve any better or treated any better. And some would reckon that to break that cycle, self-love is the solution."
