NatureIsFuckingLit,ffe2p2n,t1_ffe0bsx,1579835140.0,"We have two cats, and we spent *years* suffering from cat fur on everything. We couldn't even touch our Japanese bobtail, because she would explode fur from every crevice. I would brush and brush and brush, and it would help for a couple of days, then more fur. Sometimes I would brush our maine coon, and get an entire extra cat-worth of fur out of him. Then we discovered salmon oil. We spritz their food with it every feeding, mix it in, and they basically don't shed any more. They get so much more love because we don't hate touching them, and we're so much happier. I barely get the magic brush out anymore, although they still get a heavy brushing in the spring."

She catches a glimpse of the box's reflection in the toaster oven, a dramatic curl of pink, splashing into a glass.  The color reminds her of something, something long ago, but she can't put her finger on it.  She pours herself a glass."

Maybe an inpurity that cooled differently than the surrounding glass, causing a circle of stress around it.  Or maybe the glass was stressed by a suction cup that held it at the glass foundry.  Either way, the mechanical force just triggered it, the circle was probably already there."
