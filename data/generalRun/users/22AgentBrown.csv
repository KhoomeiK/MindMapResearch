Cloververse,fg81z4g,t1_fg7p52x,1580607374.0,"Another thing I remember is that JJ recently got some offers to direct some projects set in the DC universe, so I'm not sure how he's gonna balance that out plus a Cloverfield sequel. And since you mentioned JJ leaving Paramount makes it all the more uncertain. I just don't know what to make of any it"
Cloververse,fg7bvp5,t1_fg7ao0e,1580588780.0,JJ announced it in April 2018 but hasn't spoken about since.
Cloververse,fg75qr3,t1_fg6xyu9,1580584639.0,"It's not that I think they owe me anything,  if JJ never announced a sequel to Cloverfield two years ago then there would be nothing to expect. Plus on top of that, he never updated fans of the franchise on how progress was going. He could still update people and remain secretive if he really wanted to"
Cloververse,fg6t4o9,t1_fg6slyi,1580576268.0,I can respect that

TheSocietyNetflix,fg6op14,t1_fg6fucr,1580573340.0,That’s one thing I didn’t understand about the character is why he has few friends since psychopaths are able to charm and manipulate people
Cloververse,fg5ramf,t1_fg5b9rg,1580535989.0,"Yeah you're right, I'd love to see what JJ comes up with when and if the sequel is still coming"
Cloververse,fg5r80y,t1_fg57eam,1580535921.0,"Which I think is possible given that fans loved Lane, and I think since it' been two years since Paradox , now would be a good time to tease another Cloverfield movie."
Cloververse,fg5pkek,t1_fg4w8ye,1580534332.0,That's one way of looking at it
Cloververse,fg5pjeo,t1_fg5c2ai,1580534307.0,Yeah I try and be more optimistic and I'll stick it out until this Sunday at least
Cloververse,fg5pgk7,t1_fg4yv30,1580534233.0,"See that's the thing about it, is we don't know how far into production the sequel is in whether there's been a script written or if it's even been filmed. I know the franchise loves the element of surprise but I hate being out of the know all together with this"
Bumble,fg2rvcr,t3_evqdza,1580453366.0,I really admire the maturity in this message.

unpopularopinion,fg1oear,t3_ew55tq,1580430788.0,"Okay I'm gonna leave my two cents about this post. I do not have an issue with people posting about their kids on social media, but it subtly reminds me of how much of a failure I am because I don't have kids of my own. I'm a loser that's never even dated or kissed a woman. I never had a girlfriend before so I can't even begin thinking about kids although I would love to have some. Preferably daughters .But I know I will never be a parent or anyone's husband and seeing people post pictures of their families increases the internalized hatred I have for myself. I hope that all makes sense"

Cloververse,fe6re5m,t3_eml4kr,1578901811.0,There was a major Cloverfield reference where TJ Miller said he  saw someone imploding which was when Marlena was killed by a Parasite
Cloververse,fe6qbxw,t3_emk28f,1578900437.0,I watched it just now and it started off pretty intense but it just got cheesier as it went on . It was very similar to Cloverfield but not nearly as good

YouOnLifetime,fdsft9v,t3_emy6ov,1578701800.0,"Most sociopaths prey on the the vulnerable and when Love turned out to be evil like Joe, it was a turnoff. He's not looking for someone to love but someone to control."
Cloververse,fds1rkm,t3_ems72l,1578693026.0,"What I don't understand is why they just didn't make a franchise out of Cloverfield 10 years ago.  The reason Paradox failed is because it was disjointed , and didn't make that much sense .  And the references were just shoehorned in . And I don't understand why the status of the true sequel hasn't been updated to let us know its still coming"
