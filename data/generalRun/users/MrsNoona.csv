You definitely can stop any other horse like this, but some race horses have it so butchered in their heads that they will run forwards even if it means death, due to heavy training since youth. I have seen race horses who retired and couldn't go for a ride without a guide horse in front, because they did not understand the order to turn (they only walked straight with rider on back). Horses naturally prefer dodging obstacles rather than jumping or storming through them, so to train a horse to do steeplechase, you gotta nearly remove their dodging instinct, so they will jump even the obstacles they do not have the abilities to get over (one of the many reasons why horses die during these races). ... So this lady probably knew what she was doing, but she didn't realise that this horse ain't stopping. It tried to run around her, but ended up blasting right into her, which is a thing I have actually never seen happen before and I've been around horses for a while. Yup this is the way to stop a horse, but sadly this horse doesn't know that."

To answer your question clearly - I know few people who show interest in me but I carefully select who to let get closer due to anxiety. Playing videogames and chatting online with anons has by far been the best way to slowly introduce myself to wonders of social life. (And I'm actually finding out I love everyone so much)
 Some people sadly start of low and need to be approached with more care, but same as everyone, they will also find their way up. Just at their own pace.

The numbers sound pretty, but the execution will be the hardest part. In order for us to turn fully responsibly green, we have to first stabilize this topic of energy. I agree with what most people say underneath this post - nuclear is the way to go for now. Once energy becomes a safer topic, we can start introducing green behavior. Before then, people will simply milk the drama and do more harm than good. (For example my country invested millions into solar power plants, but instead of creating the promised easy low energy income for small households, they turned it into business and turned forests into powerplants which are now owned by China and we have to buy our power from them back) This prediction sounds fullfilable, but - it's not going to be a matter of 50 years.
