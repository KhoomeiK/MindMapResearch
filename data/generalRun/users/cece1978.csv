news,fevqf3v,t1_ferbyyk,1579400254.0,"I have to disagree with you here. It’s been my experience that nurse practitioners are actually the bomb dot com. The nursing profession has a slightly different philosophy than physicians, and are frequently more attentive/thorough in our experiences.

First urgent care visit: physician

First ER visit: physician

Second ER visit: physician assistant

Second urgent care visit: physician assistant

Third ER visit: physician 

While at that ICU, there was a nurse practitioner that supervised the charge nurses. She did not provide direct care to my husband, but was very helpful in helping me advocate to the doctors, in getting information i needed to make informed decisions. She visited with me three times, taking an interest, i think, bc she had been through a health crisis with her own husband when she was my age.

I also have an old college friend whose mother was a newly retired ER/neurology nurse. Not a nurse practitioner, but an extremely competent nurse with 35 yrs experience. Throughout the hospital stays, she was a huge resource for me, both professionally and emotionally. That’s the thing with nurses: they are frequently the type of people that have their shit together and are just in general, pretty amazing.

All three of us (me, husband, daughter) have the same primary care provider, and she’s fantastic. She’s a nurse practitioner.

I think it has everything to do with the way that a hospital/provider group is managed. You treat your staff like crap and overwork them, the most talented ones leave. You create a bottom-line workplace culture, and the providers feel pressured to spread themselves unethically thin. I’ve seen the same phenomenon in public education. It’s tragic."
news,fevm09l,t1_fevaipx,1579398931.0,"The thing is, when you’re in this position, you’re angry and want them to be held accountable, but it’s so difficult to take those steps while you’re trying to deal with all of the strife it causes.

We had to adjust to my husband being newly disabled. finding him a reliable caregiver, supporting him through that. He wasn’t just physically impaired, but also had brain damage. So those first couple of months home were pretty awful. I wanted to go back to work, but couldn’t, bc we had crappy experiences with caregivers (not showing up, eating our food, showing up high, overwhelming my husband with their own personal problems, asking if they could have a few of his painkillers...this was not just one caregiver, but a slew of them. We just couldn’t catch a break at first.) he couldn’t be left alone, bc he wasn’t yet able to understand his new limitations. That first month, i had to call 911 three times bc he wasn’t transferring himself correctly, and had fallen. We had to fight to get a transfer sling, which is $400. So, not only could he hurt himself, I couldn’t get him back into his chair if he fell. One time, he tried to roll his wheelchair up our door ramp, and ended up upside down on our driveway, strapped into his chair. It’s not that he was trying to hurt himself; his brain just wasn’t working correctly.

He was still recovering too, and i was trying to think of any possible way he could recover as much as possible.

I was also dealing with my own stuff. Stressed out, realizing the newfound financial situation we were now in, as it became clear he would not return to work. Trying to monitor how our young daughter was coping. Feeling frustrated that my husband couldn’t comply with safety/self-care, which made the situation worse. Trying to compartmentalize the personal care I provided him, to keep it separate from his identity as my husband, wondering if our marriage would endure.

All of his care after leaving the ICU was from other medical groups. I was adamant about that.

I still wish we had filed a malpractice suit, but the reality is that we were already so completely overwhelmed. Life has to go on. We had a mortgage to pay. Our daughter started kindergarten. We just had to keep going."

No, it totally shouldn’t. If i had not insisted on bringing him back over and over again, he would have literally died.

Here’s the part that I don’t think I’ll ever get past:

I’m a college-educated person and English is my first language. I’ve got 4 years of legal advocacy experience and 8 yrs of direct care in a pediatric hospital. If it was that hard for ME to get what he needed, can you even imagine how difficult it would have been for anybody else? I think of the probability that this HAS happened to others, with a much darker outcome, and it makes me want to throw up."
news,fepak0q,t3_eq1u06,1579315842.0,"Husband had flu, and then got better. Suddenly became very ill with flu-like symptoms again. Couple days in, I took him to urgent care, and was told he still had the flu. I mentioned that our family all got the flu at the same time, all got better, and are we sure he got another flu? Doctor said yes, that must be it.

Later that week, his fever is not going below 101.5, despite tylenol and ibuprofen. Take him to ER again. Tell history and symptoms in detail. I explain that he needs assistance getting up to walk to bathroom bc he is dizzy. Nope, just flu.

More days go by. He has massive headache that makes him want to vomit. He hasn’t eaten in 6 days. I have to keep coaxing him to take sips of water. He is acting odd, sometimes gibberish but not exclusively. I tell him not to get out of bed unless i help him. But he can’t remember that i told him that. I find him on the bedroom floor bc he tried to walk to bathroom on his own. I take him to ER. Nope, still flu. I ask if he might at least be dehydrated? Nope, give it time, they say. What about him telling me he can’t pee? Oh, probably bc he needs to drink more water, they say.

Next day he is having more difficulty walking. Difficulty urinating. I get him into urgent care asap, thinking I can’t take another chance with the fucknuts at ER. Have to use a wheelchair to get him inside. He cannot urinate and is unable to walk steady. High fever persists. Xrays for pneumonia done. Yes has pneumonia. Doctor writes rx for antibiotic and tries to send us home. I refuse and burst into tears. I explain that godamnit there is something very very wrong with my husband and nobody is listening to me. She tells me to take him to ER.

Get him there and i insist he is taken back immediately. Like, I’m a crazy person refusing to wait until he is at least seen by the triage nurse.

He’s admitted that evening. Meningitis. I go home and plan to come back early AM. Get called 3am to tell me his lungs collapsed and he’s on breathing machine. They don’t know if he’ll come out of it. He’s moved to ICU.

Condition continues to worsen. Tracheotomy performed. Medically-induced coma. Sepsis. Now has encephalitis (brain swelling.) paralyzed from neck down. They don’t know what it is. Infectious disease specialist called in. Neurologists monitoring. Medical team stumped. 

We have a 3 yr old daughter. They don’t know if he will live. If he does, they don’t know degree of function he’ll recover. I am pissed, thinking about times i took him to ER or urgent care and very explicitly communicated his symptoms, as well as my concern that something bigger than “the flu” was going on. No tests done at all until that xrays for pneumonia. They all use the same med records bc they are all the same fucking provider.

4 weeks in ICU, touch and go.

Makes it. Another 4 weeks in hospital to learn how to breath and eat again. Another 6 weeks in rehab hospital to learn how to toilet, shower, etc as a paraplegic. Comes home in wheelchair.

Diagnosis in the end: Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)

3 yrs later, today, he can walk with a walker, but still paraplegic. He’ll never work again bc he has an acquired brain injury from the fevers/swelling. He has practically no short term memory now. 

He has PTSD from the experience. I have PTSD from the helplessness i felt for the two weeks i tried to get a doctor to take his symptoms seriously. My daughter has a father that will never be able to independently care for her, drive her to the park, or play basketball with her. We will not be able to have any other children. He has 4 hrs of caregiving each weekday while I’m at work.

The ER and urgent care are all the same medical group. These assholes almost let my husband die. It took 10 days and 5 visits to doctor to get them to finally help him. That is fucking unacceptable."

Is it insomnia, or just not enough time to sleep? I started averaging 3-4 hrs a night for a few months and i ended up having a mini-breakdown. Had to do some lifestyle adjustments (in my case, make room for an hour of cardio each morning and allow myself a non-working lunch without any company each weekday.

See? This is the culture I am talking about. See my post above. This person is most probably a doctor, based on this reasoning. ☝️


Imagine spending years of blood, sweat, tears, and money (so.much.money.) achieving your personal dream. You recognize that your peers more than likely did the same. You have a significant respect for those peers, recognizing the fortitude/resilience needed to be where you’re at. A camaraderie like no other. Is it self-congratulatory? Hell yes. Is it valid though? Hell yeah. Providers are damn-hard workers.


But the workplace culture borne from that is like an awkward, overly polite waltz. It’s hideous, and costing patients their quality of life. Sometimes it’s fatal.


And it’s bullshit. You’ve got some very intelligent people, conditioned into following these norms, bc it’s fear-based. And so finely woven in that it’s disguised as teamwork."
IAmA,fdaxlpw,t1_fdaehph,1578251586.0,"You would not believe the things that medical providers (MD’s, RN’s, PA’s, NP’s, and allied professionals——the full gamut) are conditioned to turn a blind eye to. The culture is pretty universally one in which snitches get stitches. There are some complex (frequently hierarchical) logistics at play. And I don’t just mean those at “the bottom”...even heads of surgery have spent years learning the way to play to the CEO or Boards of Director. By the time they’re hired into the top positions, the indoctrination is complete.
It’s not that there are tons of conspiratorial coverups, or that most providers are shitty people: it’s more basic than that. They don’t have the resources to pull the loose threads they encounter on each shift. They snip, and go."
