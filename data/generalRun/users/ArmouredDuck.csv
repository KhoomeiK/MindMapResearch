I was being generous by lumping only tribal strategies together because they rely on lords, not because they have vial (or I'd have said as such, but spouting nonsense to validate illigetimate arguments is easier I guess).

I never said they can't play their decks. You're legitimately making shit up as you go to win an argument you've already lost. I've already stated that fnm is casual enough to win with most any deck. I've also stated you cannot win tournaments with these decks. At no point did I say they shouldn't play their deck, I said tell people the honest truth about modern.

If you take [metagame break down](https://www.mtgtop8.com/format?f=MO) of the last two months and count every deck with over 10 showings you get 19 decks. Many of those are the exact same archetype (Humans, Spirits and Merfolk are all tribal decks) while many are virtually exactly the same in how theyd like to win (Valakut, Titan, etc). Dislike it however much you want but doing otherwise is lying to people. If they want to play vampire tribal or mill they will never win a proper tournament with those decks and telling them otherwise is spitting in their face."
ModernMagic,ffblzub,t1_ffblmm6,1579771934.0,Arguing that you can win at FNM with any deck is like saying you can win at your kitchen table with mates with any deck.

The format is very powerful and closed to a huge amount of play styles and decks. An easy example is mill, I do not think it could win a format as the meta stands. And with Ox coming I'd wager dredge is about to take over the format and shut out a huge number of decks yet again."
ModernMagic,ffbf8ip,t1_ffbcshg,1579762710.0,"Are you insane? Pre hogaak looting decks were like 60% of the meta, modern was virtually a T3 format and midrange was dead. The vast majority of decks were aggro-combo such as dredge, phoenix etc, and games were determined if you could roll dice well (go first) and how well you could draw your first 7 cards. 

The meta was fucking abysmal, looting absolutely needed to go. For these GY decks it was a draw two, enable your combo for R with flashback. That's insanely good, arguably better than OuaT as it was a better top deck, which I also expect a ban of eventually and I own 4.
