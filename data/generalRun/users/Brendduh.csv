books,fc4jlaw,t1_fc4i5gv,1577418552.0,"Yes, crime novel but also exactly daily struggles-life too. Particularly financial and class struggles, focusing with a mindset and thoughts of the protagonist/detective and how about he feels for the victim who has succumbed to all to common pitfalls of societal structures into credit and identity fraud. It is his daily lot in life to ponder these reasons why and to search for truth in his own life as well as those whom it is his profession to protect. Very Lovingly written, very humanistic.     I think you could not do much better than this book for what you are after so enjoy!"
