vagabond,ffoavhj,t3_eudfou,1580075831.0,"Oregon in general seems to be more laid back about panhandlers compared to California. Almost every gas station or truck stop will let u fly a sign as long as you stay just outside the property. Like u can be one step off the property and they'll usually leave u alone. Cuz they legally can't make u leave a public sidewalk or whatever. 

It really depends where u are in any individual area. Like I'm from Humboldt county and if you're in fortuna people are probably gonna treat u like shit, yell at you when they drive past ECT. But in arcata u will definitely get some leftovers or some pocket change if you set up in the right spot and act respectful.eureka is more hit and miss because of all the heroin junkies and tweakers making the travellers or whatever automatically fall into the junkie catagory.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_de_Fuca_Plate

Look at how close the bottom corner of the plate is to the coast line at cape Mendocino. Basically it drops off closer to shore than it normally does. And that somehow effects the roughness of the ocean there.

Here's a real bathymetric map. Its kinda hard to compare to a normal coastline since it's pretty zoomed in. But u can see how it really slopes down and gets relatively deep pretty quickly.

todayilearned,ff79vgh,t1_ff6emam,1579644141.0,"I like to leave little Easter eggs in weird spots when I'm backpacking way out in the high country. Like I'll bring a crystal and put it in the lake on top of a Lilly pad or stuck in a cedar sapling that has a crack in the bark. I like writing poems with charcoal on river rocks that people might see when getting water. 

But where I go backpacking there aren't very many visitors each year given the remoteness. So people like to leave carvings and stuff. I was sitting on a log used as a seat next to lake that takes at least two  ~20 mile days to reach. And it had initials and dates that were from the late 80s and early 90s. It's definitely not ok to bring plants to seed out there or purposely making a permanent mark on the landscape. But I personally think it's ok to leave a little something, and it helps me remember the place. I can visualize a lot of the things I've left out there and where exactly they're at. Even though I haven't returned to that particular spot in years.

Edit: probably doesn't make sense to most ppl based on there experience. Try to imagine being in a place you can be sure that less than a few thousand people have ever been.

 Then you start to think about it. He was up against all those corrupt bastards for decades. No wonder they don't like him. It seems like all the Democratic establishment has gotten done in the past 12 years is keep us in the wars, destroy our workers lives and the manufacturing base of our country, give away trillions in taxpayer dollars to keep the corrupt system chugging along artificially. They should be embarrassed just as much as the republicans should be. It's two sides of the same coin.

The reason they are suddenly going after Bernie a week before the primaries start isnt some random coincidence. He scares them. They hate him because they just want to keep collecting there bribes. Like seriously Hillary how did u become extremely rich by being a career politician? Is the any reason besides corruption that she is worth like 100 million dollars or whatever. 

Fuck these people and fuck the system they support under the guise of working for the people that give them the power they have decided to corrupt. Seeing fox news almost give Bernie a better light than the liberal media is terrifying. Was it ever really about trump being a bad guy? Or was it about them trying to brainwash people into blindly supporting the establishment with the guise of it being so incredibly urgent and serious of a problem. 

This whole impeachment thing has convinced me that if Bernie doesn't get the primary I'm voting for trump. He asks them to investigate to e former vice presidents corruption. And they are all like, no you. It's fucking ridiculous and a double standard that shouldn't be thought of as normal. The only reason they didn't take him up on charges of corruption or the  emoluments clause is because they're all guilty of it and don't want to stir the shit. Hell Joe is on record bragging about using quid pro quo to protect his interests over there in Ukraine.

The media is lying to us and we all seem to just eat it up like a fucking shit sandwich. I think this recent smear campaign by the wealthy against Bernie's campaign is a big wake up call, at least for me. Theyll lie and cheat to win and they steal as soon as they have they power. Maybe they don't steal for themselves right off the bat. But they know that if they help line the elites pockets they'll have a very comfortable life from then on. Why is Obama suddenly super rich?

mildlyinfuriating,ff2myji,t3_er87nj,1579514027.0,Just make sure u have a maid and a steam cleaner. Getting out of the shower and being able to walk around on a nice warm floor sounds super nice. But the inevitable misfires from drunk sniping make it disgusting without a way to clean it regularly.
news,ff2dksv,t1_ff1v3my,1579501810.0,I got out of the ER after getting a nasty tick bite. It was like 11 or 12 at night and sprinkling out but I didn't have a car at the time so I had to walk. About a block up the street from the hospital I see this homeless guy sitting in the rain. He didn't have any legs and looked really bad. He asked me if I would be willing to help him up a few stairs so he would under a roof attached to a clinic building. I felt super bad for that guy man. he was super appreciative and I continued on my walk back home. The whole time just tripping on how sad that situation was and how I should've given him some money or something. I forget about that situation then when it comes back it makes me realize how good I have it.

lifehacks,ff1hq4c,t3_eqw0f9,1579479412.0,"When I was like 11 we were finally allowed to go trick or treating alone. And a friend of mine that was with us said he had to poop. But we were like a 20 minute walk from my house which was the closest. He was literally nearly crying he had to poop and knew it was gonna be in his pants lol. So he goes up and knocks on a random door along the way back home. They say sorry we don't have any candy, but he instead asks to use there bathroom lol. They let him in, he came back out like 5 minutes later and we just kept on going. Moral of the story is that people might just let u poop in there house if you're really in a pinch."

We were in the garage on the side of the house as had music playing or whatever so they knew someone was back there. I'll never forget the look on that poor old Jehovah's witnesses face when she could finally see inside the garage. I just started laughing while the buddy that was caught mid-hit was coughing his ass off and tryin to hide the bong. Yeah they probably never came back there ever again."

cyberpunkgame,feoe3dv,t3_eq3j83,1579298859.0,Im just disappointed because I normally buy a game like 6 months after it comes out or more. So now I'm gonna be waiting till 2021 for this game. It's ok though better that the games actually done instead of rushing it ahead just to meet a deadline.
unpopularopinion,fenztwp,t3_eq2knz,1579293149.0,"Usually I'll either get em a cheap hurricane, those 3 for a dollar cigars, or a pint of chocolate milk depending on what time of day or whatever. Like I'll ask em u want a beer, cigar, ECT when they ask for change. Most of the time they don't want it and just want the money so I might give em some spare change if I even have any. Don't feel bad at all giving em beer or whatever. Usually I'll just get beer for the hardcore alcoholic guys cuz I know they actually need it. It's kinda sad but we have so many homeless where I live that it just seems normal"

One of em has somehow stayed open even though it's been closed for health violations that's make you wanna puke when u read the reasons listen. But they just open back up a short period of time later. I swear it's like a drug front or something.
worldnews,feljqsb,t1_fekr0es,1579223840.0,"That would be an interesting way to do like a chemical attack or something.

Spread one thing that's undetectable and spreads super easily. Then u could use a small amount of like an activator or something (idk I'm not a scientist) that would react with the other substance and make the poison from that reaction.

Or like u said accidentally release two ""harmless"" chemicals that might react in like the water tanks or the air that would make people extremely ill."

We were like dad why haven't u cleaned this shit up. And he got all mad and said I need to clean it for him even though it was his dog since I have a little Chihuahua and would've cleaned up her shit. I basically said I want doing it then one of my buddies was like I'll do it. But I was like fuck that it's his problem so we all just left to chill at the park instead. I came home like 9 hours later like past midnight and I walk in the house. The diarrhea was still all over the floor. Ended up just going to my mom's instead. Next time I went there it was cleaned up but it really pissed me off how stubborn he was about someone cleaning up what was essentially his mess that he would not clean it up even before going to bed that night."

But she thought it was racist and must have not liked her much anyway cuz she went to the manager about it. She didn't really get in trouble but the manager basically told her that she couldn't be starting shit at work and it needed to stop. She ended up quiting like a month after that. 

The lady thought everyone was racist because they didn't like her being racist towards them lol. It was all women too by the way just for context. Idk how it would have gone down if it was some guys on a construction job vs baristas in a coffee shop."
