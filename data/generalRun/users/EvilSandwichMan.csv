In this day and age, no way would a bounty hunter be able to pull his bounty off into another room of (say for example) a police station, shoot him, and then bring back the corpse.

I began to realize that one of the distinctions in fantasy and sci-fi is the weakness of the rule of law. In sci-fi, you sort of expect modern benefits to reach their extreme, like for instance law to be a powerful force in an ordered society. You also expect classes to be more well-defined (for example, you wouldn't expect to bump elbows during a formal business dinner with a Hutt), but in star wars you still have the absolutely ordinary businessman in the same dining hall as monstrously looking slave traders.

&nbsp;

Much like in Rome, there's also no real 'police' presence, but every person with some degree of power or wealth has their own hired cadre keeping them safe.

&nbsp;

In Star TREK, you have many non-aligned worlds with governments and military forces. Many issues are held in an actual court, and there's no/few extrajudicial actions being committed (and those that are, are treated as unlawful and subject to legal backlash. For example when (Picard?) uncovered a secret federation experiment to create cloaking technology despite treaties with the Romulans forbidding developments in this field, and the perpetrators and conspirators were revealed and suffered legal consequences). The absolute power and importance of law seems to be a major theme and difference between sci-fi and fantasy, and the difference between Star TREK and Star WARS hinges on examples like this."

So wait....why assume the worst of the employee and the best of the employer? You could equally say they'll just fire you if they know you're just leaving and give you no recompense for it, whereas you could also equally say the employer gives you two weeks notice so you can find another job.

B race live on the sides of these mountains and unless you actually enter WITHIN the mountain range or above one of the peaks itself, you could never accidentally look within. B race could live in structures built INTO the mountains from within the mountain range or on their faces (and these are obscured from view by the tips of the mountains pointing out over them). Their city could stretch deep down into the center of the earth and could be carved out in tiers, the highest tier STILL being below the normal level of ground beyond the mountain range. An unnatural cold and gathering of mist could obscure view from on high and also make it too dangerous to attempt to fly within, as it's easy to crash into an unseen jutting mountain, or even a spire from the city itself. The city could even have precautions to destroy any aircraft flying over them, causing a reputation for the area to be far too dangerous to traverse without absolutely urgent purposes. Additionally, to keep people away from the mountain range EVEN IF people should attempt to brave the forests, are an abundance of minerals around the mountains that are highly radioactive. People in the modern day didn't find out about radiation until....what, the 60s? In your setting, people could've found out about it earlier (even asbestos was known to cause lung issues as far back as Pliny the elder who spoke about the people who mined it as getting a sickness of the lung) and thus they know to stay away from the mineral if they should so recognize it (or have heard tales of its existence around the mountain range).

Alternatively, if you're not committed to a design of creature for your race B, you could have them literally be of a form of matter that is almost unheard of.

Also, you could have that there's a local, violent tribal society that lives within the forest.
