todayilearned,fcux3ch,t1_fcupfhq,1577990273.0,My wife is from Guernsey. We've spent many a long glorious summer day on Cobo beach followed by long and messy summer evenings in the Rockmount. I used to hate the smallness when I first went (in my 20s) now I love it.

The officer knew that this guy was never really a serious threat, nor could he actually invade the island to any effect. 7 days in Sark's police cell is a bit harsh if anything. I'm sure that had any actual harm been caused he would have been immediately shipped to Guernsey, where they have an actual court, and placed on trial."
todayilearned,fcuoeez,t1_fcun0dk,1577985277.0,"So the channel Islands hold a somewhat different status than most places in terms of their sovereignty. They are technically independent but under the protection of the UK.

Jersey (The largest island) has its own parliament, and the others being under the parliament based on Guernsey (the second largest island). 2 are privately owned but still part of Guernsey's bailiwick.

So people think (probably largely jokingly) that they can invade one of the smaller islands in the same way as one country might invade another, and claim it as their nation state, they can't, and if they did it seriously, the Royal Navy would turn up pretty quick with a few hundred mildly annoyed marines to sort it out."

todayilearned,fcumsqu,t1_fcujlij,1577984365.0,"You're not from the Channel Islands are you? My wife grew up on one of the other islands, law enforcement is a little less formal in a community with no cars and 1 shop."
facepalm,fcrdmay,t3_eikhj1,1577900406.0,"Your friend is technically correct.

There was no year 0 we went from 1BC to 1AD. So as there are 100 years in a century, not 99, 2000 was the last year of the 20th century and the 21st century started on the first of January 2001.

Though it has become the general trend to mark the passing of a decade/century when the 9 becomes a 0."

I never claimed otherwise, no idea why you seem so offended by the fact that I'm amused by the use of a word."
