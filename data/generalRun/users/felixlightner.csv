Make face to face contact with people that will pay you. **Never ever work for free.** Your work is professional looking. Never say I'm starting out. So pick one thing, corporate headshots, real estate, wedding, etc and go introduce yourself to people. Take your **rate schedule and contract** and do not lower your price ( you will be low balled). For example start on a street in your town with mom and pop/hipster stores, walk in and say would you like professional headshots or interiors for your website. Show them your headshot/interior portfolio. If no leave your card and ask if the know anyone who might be looking. Press the flesh and pound the pavement.
