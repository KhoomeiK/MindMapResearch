cats,ffdtczp,t1_ffdqjin,1579828436.0,"I agree. It could also be partially love bites. Our cat would playfully nip our fingers when he was little. He does it less often now, but he still does."
Advice,ffdnz1h,t1_ffdnhal,1579824928.0,"I don't know where you live, but you should be applying for ten times the number of jobs. Its a numbers game. If you're in a college town, there are probably more jobs in food service sector, but look to see if you can find something in the field you're studying.  For example, if you're studying graphic design, see if any local companies offer internships or if they know of any jobs. Networking helped me get several jobs."
Advice,ffdnadk,t3_et1ybr,1579824514.0,"How many jobs have you applied for? How many interviews have you had? You say you've had no luck getting a job. It's not about luck, its about effort and willingness to do what it takes. It's not going to look good that you quit a job without having another one lined up. Hope you learned something from the experience."

cats,ff90wpf,t3_esbsog,1579702042.0,"Make sure to pack toys and a cat tree in your first load. Also, if they have beds or a favorite blanket take that over, too. Then, if you can, take them over for a couple hours that evening while you unpack boxes. Take them back home with you that night. The next day, take food and water over for them and let them wander a bit, locate their food and water and get settled.  Eventually they'll realize it's their new home, especially with you being there. Cats are definitely harder to move than dogs, but its worth the extra time to make it easier for them."

Obviously she didn't drive any car, but the placard made it convenient for whoever was driving her that day. If you've ever tried to navigate through a busy parking lot on foot with a blind person, you have faced an extreme challenge. That placard was quite a lifesaver."

That just leads to self-destruction."

family,ff79ri4,t3_es1f0m,1579644059.0,"I have a family member with these same issues and about the same age. She doesn't talk to me anymore because she thinks I took her husband's side in their divorce. That's true, I did, but only because I thought she was harming her children with her selfishness, paranoia and other mental issues. She's the type of person who is NEVER wrong, by the way. It's got to be her way or the highway. Anyway, as a family we decided we had to focus on what was best for her children. There were times we confronted her, but she refuses to change. Now, for the most part, the family avoids her. She has made it clear that she thinks we are the problem, not her. It hurts, but sometimes you have to let go. I wish I had helpful advice for you, but all I can say is you're not alone. Good luck."

All the help we've all given him over the last 25+ years has never been appreciated by him and only enabled him to continue being a sponge, a leech, sucking us all dry. And nothing is ever his own fault. Last two jobs he lost it was because ""they"" had it in for him. We finally (for our own mental and physical health) drew a line and stuck to it. Somehow he's managed to pay his bills for 2 years. Now we have minimal contact with him.

relationship_advice,fevz7g3,t3_eqqrdb,1579403326.0,"I've got an alcoholic sister and had an alcoholic mom, so I've got experience dealing with people who drink too much. 
Alcohol can put incredible pressure on a marriage and family. It's your decision, but if I were you I would think hard about what your life and relationship goals are. 
My sister chose alcohol over family. My mom chose to not seek treatment because she was depressed. Well, duh! Alcohol is a depressant. 
You didn't give details of how alcohol affects him, how often he drinks and how much. Also, what is the financial cost of his drinking? Does it keep him from working? Would you trust him to care for your children (when/if you have them) while he's drinking? 
Have you talked to him about his drinking? Is he willing to stop or limit his alcohol consumption? See a counselor?
I think you have a lot to consider before making a decision. I hope I've been helpful by providing some food for thought."

This might mean dedicating more time or using different methods. When I  started college I had to change the way I studied AND spend more time at it. To avoid discouragement, focus on the positive.  You may not get straight As, but if you do better on the second test than the first, celebrate the improvement. Also, it helped me to reward myself  after a long library study session (for example) by going out for pizza or a burger with friends.
