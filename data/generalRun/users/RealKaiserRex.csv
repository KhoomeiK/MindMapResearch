offmychest,fbyv7tt,t3_ef7bsr,1577227228.0,"If you really think about it, someone like him is going to get a real slap in the face by reality once he hits 18. In fact, look at it this way, your life is and will be way better than his. With his attitude, I doubt he's able to make any friends. Your mom will probably get so sick of him that one day he's going to get kicked out of the house by 18. You're going to go to college and make a career and life for yourself. He's probably going to work at a low-paying dead-end job. Your life is going to get better and better while his life will spiral downward. He'll be all alone with no one to go crying to and no one to care. I'd say you should pity him for how pathetic his life will be compared to yours :)"
