Showerthoughts,ffj6kpn,t3_etr5pr,1579991676.0,"Of course. Here's an article from 1991 about what Southwest airlines did to high speed rail in Texas :

https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-05-28-fi-2620-story.html

To paraphrase: 'To get as far as it has, the rapid rail system has had to overcome a powerful opponent, Southwest Airlines, which serves the same routes as those planned for the fast train. Southwest Airlines Chairman Herb Kelleher has fought the system every step of the way. He and his lobbyists worked to prevent the Legislature from establishing the High-Speed Rail Authority, which was finally approved in 1989.

After that, Southwest Airlines went to court to try to have the authority declared illegal under the state Constitution. That effort also failed.

Kelleher has called the train system a “backward somersault into the 19th Century” and questioned its financial feasibility, particularly its ability to operate without major subsidies.

Rail backers say that although Kelleher could not stop the project, he was instrumental in getting the state Legislature to prohibit the use of any state funds in the building of the system.'"
