wallstreetbets,ff2emx4,t3_er5ip4,1579502970.0,Azure is a joke and the JEDI contract is being disputed. MS is getting a slight bump because they aren't allowing new licences to run on AWS. AWS still has more Windows workloads than Azure. The last year they had so many outages it's not even funny. No one with real knowledge is moving an enterprise to Azure. There's a few who are drinking the Koolaid but most are not.
