It doesn’t necessarily have to be forever. Some people can stay friends with an ex but only when they don’t have feeling for them. 

It might be easier to tell them you’d like to be friends but you aren’t ready for that now and that you’ll be in touch when you feel you are over it. I have to warn you though I did that with an ex but it didn’t work out so well. Didn’t speak to my ex for about 6 months and elderly I was over him  I even started dating again.

I did try staying in contact with a bf I’d lost feelings for but quickly realised he was just hoping to change my mind and still wanted to get back together. I sadly ended contact then as I realised he’d never move on while I stayed in contact with him.

I’m sure it made you feel good but it was at the expense of making them feel uncomfortable.

A and C are nothing to do with having money. If your flirting in a way that your friends make comments then I think you should tone it down. The girl is at her work place.

You need help to get unstuck from those unhelpful patterns of thinking and make changes in your life. Drugs by themselves don’t work for a lot of people. Go and see your doctor and ask to be referred to a counsellor or psychologist so you can get the extra support you need to start living the life you want.

self,fejw899,t3_epjp03,1579187280.0,"Slow down there. Your self esteem is getting in the way of enjoying your life right now. So you have had your first kiss and sex with a boyfriend who cares about you. For most people that is the dream and your life is something for them to aspire to.  Your experience is actually very normal, sure there would be people who had sex earlier but there will also be people at your age who might not have there first experience until they are in their thirties. You’re probably about average. If a friend told you there first sexual experience was 18 would you really judge them as harshly as you judge yourself.

It’s also not childish to want monogamy! In fact I’d say wanting a committed relationship is the opposite. 

I’d suggest seeing a counsellor to help you with your issues. It almost seems that you’ve got glasses on that make you perceive everything you do with negativity but it doesn’t have to be that way."

Another thing that can wake you is a full bladder. Try drinking less in the couple of hours before bed and go to the toilet just before you’re going to go to sleep.

Once you’re awake just get up and be busy. You’ll sleep better the following night.

self,feg0u67,t3_eoy8te,1579072120.0,"I don’t think that giving everyone the label of being bisexual is particularly helpful and likely to get lots of knee jerk reactions. I do think of sexuality as a spectrum though, one that we don’t have a fixed place on as it can change and develop over time. It’s also complicated as we can have sexual attraction and romantic attraction to different people and then also there are degrees of libido from high to asexuality. 

I personally don’t like the need to label each subtle variation of sexuality that there is at the moment. It can trap people into a box and cause problems when people‘s feelings start to shift."

Speaking to your doctor for advice would be a good idea too.
