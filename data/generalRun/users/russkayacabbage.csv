WTF,ffg466n,t1_ffflx79,1579898078.0,Sweet! Recorded destruction and pollution of a water source. What a champ.
AmItheAsshole,ffezojy,t1_ffeiiup,1579871534.0,"Ha! I had a manager accuse me of not being a team player after I refused to volunteer to stay for another 16 hour shift at the hospital (did the night before because it was ""mandated""). I simply said no and she tried to tell me to find someone who would. Quit about two weeks later and found out half the department heads got fired a couple months later for running it into the ground. 
Point is: value your time and don't let managers try to bully you"

MapPorn,ffaingf,t3_eshykw,1579736644.0,"From VA, I call utter bullshit. And I spend some time in MD, so I don't believe this source to be reliable in the least bit.  
Edited: I found this same post from 6 years ago (promising start for a reliable statistic) found the youtube video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd7dQh8u4Hc#t=30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd7dQh8u4Hc#t=30)) He cites this company ([https://www.marchex.com/blog/talkative/](https://www.marchex.com/blog/talkative/)) which is a company that handles call advertising analytics. So, with all that info, I'm guessing they gathered the information based on how people spoke to telemarketers on the phone, which no one picks up except for old people or naive people). I call absolute bullshit on all of this information and think it should be disregarded."
medizzy,ff7uaf0,t1_ff7tvhw,1579658527.0,Thats whats so shocking. I can't fathom being fully awake while having my jaw hanging by a thread.

medizzy,ff7nzuy,t1_ff7eddw,1579654131.0,The fact that he's conscious in that second picture is a little surprising. How does a person not just pass out? Or is it shock and adrenaline keeping him awake?
AmItheAsshole,ff7ht7m,t1_ff7dgzw,1579649876.0,"Lol I really don't care. Like you said, its a casual sub, I was adding into the conversation. I don't feel strongly one way or the other. Like most other people, I was bored so I continued the thread."
weddingplanning,ff789gm,t1_ff72r6f,1579643068.0,":/ im not sure how much help I'll be, but here's what we're doing. We're in VA, so we can't get a friend to officially be the officiant since it's not recognized here, so we're getting married in the courthouse before hand, then having our own ceremony with a friend in charge. It'll be the main part of the ceremony because neither of us are religious and the friend we have doing it knows us to our cores so he can make it personable and get it started. He'll wrap our hands and we'll say our vows then kiss.  


I'm not planning a first look because we're having a fairly intimate ceremony (like 30 people) so I want to share that moment with all of them."
weddingplanning,ff6woqh,t1_ff6q7p5,1579636434.0,":) we're doing a handfasting too. I can't imagine telling a friend that the non-party part of a wedding is inconsequential, its so rude. Thinking now, I can't imagine any of our friends caring so little. Not to be extreme OP, but you might have out-grown some of your friends."
AmItheAsshole,ff6rk14,t1_ff6qo44,1579633391.0,No I'm not. I'm adding to the conversation why someone would think it doesn't matter.
AmItheAsshole,ff6ps51,t1_ff6nvdl,1579632336.0,"Even that doesn't matter though. OP could have said ""I'm a homeowner who's about to adopt a child, I read all the rules and am legally allowed to put up said fence"". Gender has no play here and neither does their sexuality because it wasn't used against them (like another post about someone spray-painting a slur)"
AmItheAsshole,ff452zz,t1_ff3yzgm,1579555720.0,"Lol, if thats what you consider getting defensive, you're very naive. I wasn't even criticizing OP for posting the picture, I have no idea what you're talking about."

You can't speed up every time there is one, actually, there's not much you can do about the matter unless you are going dangerously under the speed limit.
