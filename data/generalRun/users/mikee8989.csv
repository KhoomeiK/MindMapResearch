Stick it on a flash drive and update it on a seperate computer then run the program and scan on the affected computer in safe mode to clean up anything and make sure none of the viruses are running in the background

SuggestALaptop,fepbqm9,t1_fep4qmm,1579316640.0,I wish they made a version of this with 2 ram slots so the graphics aren't gimped to hell with single channel RAM
mentalhealth,fei5cg2,t3_ep4c7u,1579130629.0,When I'm in the process of having fun I get depressed just knowing the fun can't last forever and that feeling immediately causes me to stop having fun.
MotoG,fdzrkk4,t3_engxld,1578794143.0,"The battery might have short-circuited causing the little chip in the battery to refuse to let it charge.  this is a safety feature that lithium ion batteries have in their charge controllers to prevent them from inflating and blowing up in your face.  

you might want to try another charger just in case something went wrong with your charger or cable as well.  


Everyone has their own experiences when it comes to which phones are good or bad.  My friend literally had his Moto G2 just straight up die after 6 months so now he goes around saying Motos are trash.    


I have a moto G5s plus coming up in 3 years still works great with no problems at all.  I will probably upgrade to the G8 if it ever comes to the US"
MotoG,fdfl4h0,t3_el0f48,1578364226.0,"I think sometimes sales reps make it deliberately difficult to activate unlocked phones.  I had an experience activating my moto g5s plus on verizon.  I checked verizon's online imei checker tool and it said congratulations your phone is a perfect match for our network so I went to the local verizon store and the rep literally pretended to type in my imei into their checker and immediately said nope sorry it's not compatible.  I asked if there was a computer I could recheck again she said no.  I eventually got her to check again and she said oh yeah I guess it is compatible after actually typing in the imei number.  

I think the sales reps only get commission for pushing new devices rather than selling sim cards."
MaladaptiveDreaming,fd3x8as,t3_ejum5o,1578162395.0,"It started as a coping mechanism for lack of friends in my childhood then transformed into shield preventing me from forming meaningful friendships in my teens and 20s.  I don't think I developed proper social skills and social exposure due to living my my head all the time as a kid,  It really messed me up TBH"
depression,fd3t86d,t3_ejvcf6,1578161418.0,"This is the same for me only I am 30 and my teens and twenties were wasted and I'm a loner no real friends, girlfriend nothing.  I did go to a few parties in my late teens but I just ended up being the butt of jokes or completely shut out and ignored. It was miserable.  I never even got my driver's license due to having uncorrectable vision problems.  I needed help getting around because of this but no one ever wanted to help me probably because they were too busy enjoying their lives in their teens and twenties to be bothered with that kind of baggage. 

My teens were the bullied years had no friends and my 20s were the years of loss and depression.  My mom died when I was 12 but my Sister and Father both passed away in my 20s and it takes a long time to get over that I can't say I ever have.  

You still have your 20s to make up for all the bad times.  Please don't be like me and waste those years too.  At 30 I stopped caring about partying, girls and all that nonsense.  At the same time, the fact that I stopped caring about being alone living a boring life makes me majorly depressed."
pcmasterrace,fcwfj2a,t3_eixcfp,1578024312.0,hmmm the i7 2600 was released in q1 2011 and popular consensus would have us believe that the decade started in 2010.   Illuminati confirmed
nostalgia,fcp5vrk,t3_ei7yaj,1577851481.0,I never understood why they said to do this.  All you are going to do is delay your computer from blowing up until the next morning when it turns on then clicks over from 99 to 00 or 20 or whatever it can't make up it's mind resulting in explosion lol
Hydrocephalus,fcngg9p,t3_ehz6ei,1577811198.0,"I too am looking for pointers.  I just take sleeping pills right now but I don't want to become dependent on them.

I am in the same boat and have tried all the things you mention.

A little off topic:  you say anxiety and depression can be a side effect of hydrocephalus??  I seem to have more anxiety and depression than the average person but there is no real reason I should.  I tend to worry about stupid mundane things that people don't even consider and it's driving me insane"
Hydrocephalus,fckpsah,t3_eaqibq,1577730560.0,Mine failed back in february and I had to get the whole thing replaced.  My symptoms started in january.  My vision is already very bad from the resulting optic nerve damage hydro caused me before birth but it got worse and I got an extreme migraine that came and went and got worse each time leading up to where I would see flashes of light in my vision like someone was taking flash photography inside my eye even when my eyes were closed.  I started to hear what sounded like a loud windstorm outside but it was also in my head.  When I was in the car it felt like I was on a roller coaster.  These symptoms intensified over a few weeks and I finally went to the hospital expecting to get some migraine medication because every previous time I went in saying my shunt is probably failing they said nope it's fine here's some migraine medication so I expected the same but nope doc comes back and says your shunt is broken and you need to go for surgery.

depression,fcc3ytl,t3_egzvd9,1577594145.0,"Same.  But I'm not sure if my lethargy is coming from depression or one of my other health problems that don't happen to be deadly or anything just a real pain in the a$$ when it comes to having energy.  People don't even call or text to hang out anymore.  Like just because I didn't want to go out one time doesn't mean I never want to hang out ever again.  

When I do get to go out my anxiety basically acts like an energy drain that makes me super tired.  the second I get home boom there's all my energy.  I just don't get it."
MotoG,fcbtpz2,t1_fcah0cq,1577590866.0,OP could also try one of those multitouch tester apps to find if there's a dead spot as it could just be a bad spot that happens to be over the P on the keyboard  Search google play for multi touch tester and you will find a bunch
MotoG,fca485w,t1_fc7qb2s,1577562831.0,Damn that doesn't exactly fill me with confidence.   If I can use a ROM on this phone I could theoretically keep it for another 2 years.  I typically custom ROM my backup phones but if something gets messed up with my main phone now that I am on Verizon I'm screwed.
depression,fca3kod,t3_egqe95,1577562573.0,Same especially if I try something new like a new hairstyle and I go out like an extrovert proud of the change then one person laughs or says it looks weird bam back to introvert and I don't go out again for a few months.   My default mode is introvert but I think as a kid I was an extrovert until I got bullied relentlessly to the point I didn't want to interact with anyone
MotoG,fc7b9w1,t1_fc5j0vw,1577502467.0,Will installing a custom rom effect carrier compatibility at all?  I used to be on AT&T with my previous phones which was a GSM carrier and I basically bought the sim online and popped it in my phone and registered online.  Now I am on Verizon and I had to go to a verizon store and have them put the sim in my phone and activate a bunch of things.  I have heard that CDMA carriers like verizon are less forgiving for having abnormal phones ie unlocked ones not bought through them or ones with custom roms.

pcmasterrace,fc4r233,t3_efy4eg,1577425306.0,"In Dec 2010 I started playing a pirated version.  Then discovered team AVO on YT and thought might as well buy it  and go explore these servers.  I literally had no idea where to find servers so I just went on all the servers AVO hit. The mods were all on edge and would stalk any new players out of fear of being hit again.  I went through a griefing phase but in the end just played on small servers with friends.  I basically stopped playing in 2014 but picked it back up when I heard about village and pillage.  It's pretty much a different game now.  

I'm glad I never really uninstalled the game over all those years so I can pull up my late 2010 world and look at what a noob I was back then."
MotoG,fc4g6it,t3_efzuai,1577415713.0,"I still have mine after 2.5 years and it's still serving me just fine albeit with random lag spikes here and there after the last and final update in august.  I don't know if it would be something to buy at this point though.

  I was toying around with getting a G7 this year but I don't really like the whole glass back trend even on cheap phones.  I would much rather see metal like the g5s plus or plastic in exchange for a spec bump."
depression,fbmjk3a,t1_fbksgu3,1576984737.0,People say it's just a highlight reel and not to generalize about it but what they don't get is I don't even have the highlight reel.  It's like there's no reason to work hard because I don't get to play hard either way.  That's how I feel anyway.
