aww,fetfs98,t1_fetb1hl,1579375038.0,"Thats a great long life for a chinchilla! I had to unfortunately put mine down when he was about 9-10 years, due to a very very bad dental disease.

For anyone wondering, chinchilla teeth constantly grow, and can develop malocclusion dental issues which is severely painful for them. So unfortunately I had to make that call when he got too weak and was clearly in pain.

It’s the #1 reason why I have not adopted another chin, because that was very hard to go through. Great pets though, I love them."

aww,fesja8k,t1_fescfnd,1579365749.0,"They make AWESOME pets... they can live 10-20 years, have incredibly large personalities and really enjoy bonding with their owners once they develop trust if you spend time with them. 

They are like real life versions of Pikachu...

One of the several nicknames for mine was “Pikachin”

Rip Charlie, I miss that little guy."

Its not just about moving from one position to the next and setting a single keyframe. Use ease ins- and ease outs, holds, and add more “weight” behind each motion. 

Keep it up and be proud of yourself for making the first attempt, you will look back on this post one day and cringe, but its a good thing because it will prove to yourself that you got better."
