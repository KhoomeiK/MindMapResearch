When I first became a mother I remember doing the maths, and if I went back full-time to my old job earning about $80k I’d basically be working for $30k less than that a year once I accounted for childcare. It just didn’t seem worth it - my job had pretty long and thankless hours, and I wanted to be with my kid. We were so lucky that we didn’t have mortgage commitments like so many, and were able to get a cheaper rental and live off just my husband’s wage for a while. So many perfectly capable people must leave the workforce like I have. 
From what I understand anecdotally childcare centres often make pretty good money but the poor workers get paid close to minimum wage for what is such an important job. Both working parents and childcare workers get so much admiration from me. X"

I was part of a “beyond sleep training” Facebook group that really got in my brain but my little boy just wouldn’t sleep and I was literally losing my mind. I’ll just tell you straight up - if you’ve tried everything else and you really need some sleep for your own mental health then just do it. There are some very gentle methods out there like Elizabeth something’s no cry method, start with something like that. Go hardcore if you need - I firmly believe much as attachment parenting is so, so beautiful there is a tipping point where an absolute and complete lack of sleep for both you and baby outweighs any possible benefits from no training. It can be genuinely dangerous the lack of sleep for us parents (hello trying to drive!), and as for babies they do need sleep for their development too! 
If you are lucky enough that training actually works then your life will be so, so much better, you won’t know yourself. 
Sadly, my 2 year old still doesn’t sleep through despite trying every single method known to man haha. We just have him in the bed with us now (SIDS risk close to non-existant at his age now) so I can comfort him without getting up.

We have a lot to celebrate and be thankful for - our wonderful health system, for most of us our quality of life and of course our incredible scenery and open spaces are some attributes that immediately spring to mind. We consistently make the top ten worldwide for living standards for a reason, it is an absolutely awesome place and we are so, so lucky. 

Unfortunately extreme national pride has rightly or wrongly been tied with some of the uglier stereotypes of being Australian, like good old racism.

Your husband may be interpreting this action as a sign that you subconsciously think your Dad is a better Doctor than he is - there may be some professional insecurity that you just don’t know about. 
Or is just a bit hurt that he wasn’t enough. I think that would be a valid fear especially facing a lifetime of parenting. 
I’d be very gentle with your husband on this one - his feelings are totally valid if he feels like your Dad is your go-to instead of him... definitely worth clarifying that it was more support the better, not that your husband either in a Doctor capacity or emotional support role wasn’t enough."

I am in a very happy marriage but my ex does still pop into my head on occasion when things remind me of him or something happens I know he would particularly understand. 

The way I’ve dealt with these feelings is that my ex and I basically email each other any really major news (mostly to make sure we avoid ever moving to the same town to avoid awkwardness - and also out of respect for the long time we were together so we don’t hear things like me having a baby from a third party) - and then just for birthdays and Christmas. It still feels respectful to my incredible husband as he is aware of the limited communication but doesn’t have to “hear” an email if that makes sense. 

I would definitely cut the communication down and acknowledge how your current partner feels first and foremost... it sucks letting go and there is genuine pain in missing someone like this - but a compromise like my example might be a better option going forward or you will risk losing the one right there in front of you.
