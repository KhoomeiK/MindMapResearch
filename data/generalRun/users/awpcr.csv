Only a few types of sweat glands produce an odor, and those are the ones associated with thick body hair like armpit hair and pubic hair. If I don't work and plan to start home all day I might not shower, but if I do plan on going somewhere I always shower the night before, or if it's unplanned I shower before going out.
