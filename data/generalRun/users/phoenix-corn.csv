AskProfessors,ffvekko,t3_ev8gov,1580262283.0,"Well, the first thing I do is make the presentation worth a very small amount of the total grade, so you could totally skip doing it and still pass (or even get an A if you already had a high A in the course). I won't judge you. In fact, somebody deciding not to present releases a lot of stress from me because it gives everybody else a little more time for their presentations that day.

The second thing I do is that I give credit towards the creation of the visual aid, so by turning it in you can get partial credit.

Those are available to anyone. For students with accommodations, I  follow whatever they are (presentations in the privacy of my office are often what is provided). I've also allowed students to record their voice as narration instead of a live presentation, it's a nifty trick.

Ultimately though oral communication is one of the core skills in the University Learning Outcomes which means that all students are supposed to gain some experience in oral presentations as part of our degree programs. Depending on what you are studying, it may be something you have to do at work. Working with a therapist might ultimately be the best thing you can do about this because it could affect more than your college degree."

As a kid, my mom and grandma forced me to keep my hair butt length. It was terrible. I could not care for it on my own, and quite frankly was not allowed to. Even as an adult, I'm not sure if they cared nearly as much about me as they did about my ability to grow hair. At school I had to protect it from all the other kids who tried to rub shit in it, accused me of wiping my ass with it, constantly tried to cut it, and occasionally tried to light it on fire. Strangers in malls would always want to touch it and talk to my mom about how beautiful it was and how I should never be allowed to cut it. It isolated me from my classmates and instantly made me different before I ever had a chance to meet anyone.

One of the way people control women is through their hair. Don't let her husband do that to your daughter. Don't ever make her feel like her hair is more important to her dad than SHE is, and if he really does feel like her ""natural beauty"" or whatever the hell he thinks is only in her hair or looks then he seriously needs to work on that or he could seriously damage the way she feels about herself and her relationship with both of you."

Engineering students have a similar problem since there are only two computers with their software on them too.) 

If we want to open up our own labs at night for students we have to staff them ourselves for free. I've done it sometimes, in a pinch, but it's really not ideal. I'll mostly do it for senior level classes.

I was probably in kindergarten (or younger for the tornado one).

I put myself ""in charge"" of listening for tornados during bad storms. We did not live in an area prone to them (moreso than where I live now, but there has never been a tornado that touched down anywhere near my parents' home). However, I went from not really afraid of storms to laying awake during every single storm listening for sirens or tornados till I moved out. When I did leave for college, I found that a lot of that anxiety faded because my family's safety did not rely on me. If it was just me and my dog there was a lot less pressure to save everyone. 

The fire thing freaked me out because I was afraid my parents wouldn't wake up, or didn't realize how great the danger was of house fires in general, and I felt like they didn't know the ""rules"" (which were definitely to get out, not go deeper into the house to save the adults). I still struggle with this one a lot more, but as a kid any night that the house was really hot I'd just lie there and wait for the house to start on fire. Not healthy. 

I don't know how you deal with not knowing what stupid stuff will be forgotten by a kid and what stuff won't be, and I don't know if there was anything that could be said after the fact to stop that imprinting (I mean, my parents tried to keep me from being scared of this stuff, but they failed)."

I suspect a lot of these rules are written to try to keep employees from seeking reimbursement. Since we only get $500 anyway, it would sometimes be cheaper for me to fly out of a non-approved airport and room with people than using reimbursement at all."

I'm in my late 30s and it seems like a lot of men my age either didn't go to college or didn't finish, and really expected manufacturing jobs to still be around. They aren't.

Lots of people get a college degree, move back home, but then can't find work in their chosen degree field in the town they grew up in so they either are desperately underemployed or straight up unemployed with a ton of debt.

TwoXChromosomes,fdhwiy6,t1_fdhkqlz,1578431434.0,"This is something that always drove me crazy about my mom.

My mom is ENDLESSLY worried about me being raped and murdered. I am 38 and when I am visiting her she will not allow me to go to stores alone (or anywhere else) because of her intense paranoia.

However, she thinks that if a man does not drive on a date that he is bad, cheap, lazy, and disrespectful. She would NEVER let me drive myself to dates. She was afraid I'd be raped and murdered for driving alone, and that the man (see above) was somehow a bad person if he did not pick me up at her house. 

So when I was dating, I had to tell essentially strangers where I lived when I lived with her, and trust them to bring me home, and I just found that terrifying. I was 100% more comfortable driving myself to a restaurant but she wouldn't have it. Her mom, who lived with us, was the same way. She once called my car in as having been stolen because I drove to a date (yes, insane, and yes, abusive, but also WTF? How did two other women misunderstand the world THIS BADLY?) 

My mom, having been subjected to the same rules by her mom, could even tell a story about a time when a man took her to a restaurant, was obviously potentially an abuser, and she was so scared of him that she had to ask the restaurant's help to keep him away from her while she called home on a payphone and asked her dad to pick me up. She still didn't understand why I would want to drive myself. (She also insisted that men should always pay and would take away my money and wallet when I was younger and going on dates, but that's a story for a different time.)"
