I'm just saying that these individuals aren't gifting the world with their craft out of the bottom of their hearts. Shouldering the *burden* of stardom for the greater good of human culture. These are professionals who get paid money to do a job. Not charity workers. 

Being snippy with a journalist is far from the worse thing someone in Hollywood has ever done so there's no need to bust out the pitchforks. But talking with the press is part of his very well paying job. And if he acts like a bit of an ass while doing it then I'm going to come to the conclusion that he's a bit of an ass.

todayilearned,fcuii47,t1_fcudbnl,1577981757.0,"What I mean with the whole foreign imperialism thing is that the onus of responsibility is being placed on the kaisar and the nation of Germany. In a pre WWI climate where Germany is as close to a ""bad guy"" you can get. Milo doesn't mention the president or the British crown. It is unthinkable to these characters that their own *righteous* governments might be interested in murdering an entire people.

Hell the [Atlantis soldiers](https://pics.imcdb.org/0ib/plane.4.jpg) even look like [German stormtroopers](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Hazd1xseL.jpg) right down to the helmets which are distinct from the flatter British and American ones. And from a large multinational/multiracial crew the only german character in the film is [this lady](https://www.google.com/search?q=Lieutenant+Helga+Katrina+Sinclair&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS744US744&sxsrf=ACYBGNSPvPyDrfixvL11FvP7ERukHJwY6w:1577981406094&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiUj7DppuXmAhWFjp4KHQXlDPIQ_AUoAXoECA0QAw&biw=1347&bih=758). IE one of the bad guys.

Even if you hyper focus on that one line the message still isn't ""colonialism is bad"". The message is that ""bad guys are bad"". ""Germany is bad"". We must protect these primitive natives from Germany's imperialism."
todayilearned,fcu6sw1,t1_fcu451i,1577973928.0,"Sure but for the purposes of theming it's significant that the only person of power actually shown in the film is one motivated by philanthropy and who doesn't have any intention of exploiting anyone. The Kaiser and the other entities Mr Antagonist might sell the crystal to, only exist as an esoteric ""other"". For emotional purposes they're no more than an extension of the antagonist. At most, all it represents is the idea that *foreign* imperialism is bad."
todayilearned,fctziyn,t1_fctr7eu,1577967139.0,"Not really. They both have the whole ""white protagonist dude shows primitive native people the way"" plot but structurally the films are very different. 

A huge chunk of Atlantis is devoted to actually *finding Atlantis* whereas Avatar starts on Pandora with the blue aliens existence being well known.

The main characters are also radically different with different motivations. Milo is an archaeologist who seeks recognition for his work and to prove that his grandfather wasn't a fraud. Sully is a marine who seeks a new life on pandora and to re obtain the use of his legs. Milo's arc is defined by finding confidence and believing in himself. Been a while since I've seen Avatar but I'm pretty sure Sully's arc is defined by rejecting his initially selfish motivation in order to help others. Someone can correct me if that's wrong.

And wereas the overarching theme/message of Avatar is one of anti-imperialism and naturalism, Atlantis mostly lacks these themes and goes for a much more typically Disney message of ""love good"". You might argue against me here claiming that Atlantis also has anti-imperialist themes but let me explain. You see in Avatar the angry white man antagonist is one who operates as the arm of a corporation trying to drive the natives off their land. He does this fully with the will and consent of that corporation. But in Atlantis the rich guy who funds the expedition is actually totally chill, and angry white man antagonist is just a single greedy individual working against the wishes of the naturally benevolent aristocracy. In the second film (which does exist), chill rich guy sends the characters around the world to fix problems and the city of Atlantis even ends up resurfacing and joining the global community. The point of the movies being that powerful western institutions work to all our benefit, evil men are an *exception to the norm*, and that if everyone just listens to the white dudes then we can all get along swell. Far from anti-imperialist.

Atlantis and Stargate are much more the same movie. Although in that movie the antagonist is alien-god-king. Not angry white man."

I'm decently good at the game and I don't really get anything out of playing against people who are significantly less skilled than me. Nor would I imagine those people appreciate having to play against someone who is significantly better than them. Not really much point to either scenario.

I want to play with and against people at my level. Not worse and not better. If I get better then I get to play with better people. If I get worse then I play with worse people."
