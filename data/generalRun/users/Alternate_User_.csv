introvert,ff2j8cd,t3_er946x,1579508588.0,Just add a music studio and a computer lab and you got me sold.
rant,ff181jd,t1_fey29o1,1579476125.0,I believe people just are desperate for some kind of validation. It’s just annoying they have to ruin everything to try to get validated tho.
rant,ff175r4,t3_eqvui6,1579475929.0,I’ve started reading comments less and less because of this. I’m interested in what people’s thoughts on the video were but Im instead met with copy pastas.
introvert,ff16qo5,t3_eqy81k,1579475782.0,I have one person who I used to consider a friend but he creates so much drama so I tend to not be around him now. Drama is just so unnecessary.
depression,fepjm4g,t3_eq6oqo,1579322191.0,I also hate waking up. Waking up means having to deal with all your crap again. It doesn’t help that the night goes by super quickly as well.
