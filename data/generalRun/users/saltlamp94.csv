TallGirls,ffggzgy,t3_eth8jo,1579906018.0,"I seriously feel like i stayed in my last relationship a year longer than i should've because he was taller than me and i couldn't bear the thought of dating again in this tall body.

This is my first time dating in my mid twenties and it is a totally different experience from college. I've gotten some weird comments from insecure men, but in general i've gotten way more praise and attention for my height. you will be okay, i promise! You're not undesirable, and what you see as ""intimidating"" will be perceived as a confident, sexy, powerful presence to mature guys."

fatlogic,ffaaadk,t3_es9tum,1579730957.0,"oh yeah, i'm fatphobic af. someone who's always been skinny is probably has way less judgement. i know the disgraceful eating habits that got me to my highest weight, its a secret all fat people share but almost never talk about with each other."
