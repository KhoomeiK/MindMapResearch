Failing that, get between the two limbs at the back, keep whacking her until she flies away, and finish her.

Or failing that, try and provoke her to do the head slam attack (she'll try and headbutt you), and punish it by smacking her head about. Stay at a medium distance and lure her attacks out.

Key to surviving the fight is learning when her charge/rush forward attack starts, and staying just far enough back to avoid her swipes, and learning to dodge her magic attack (last third of her health bar she may use her magic missle-type attack)"

Preventing people from amassing or distributing wealth is one way to keep people poor and powerless. Feeds further into my theory from my perspective. It's all about syphoning off your money so it's not yours, it's theirs, it's all returning to the pot to be locked away.

Tax collection could just be another scheme to keep people poor, as there's certainly enough money in the hands of the top 1% to pay taxes every year.

Consider how many people there are in the US, and how many are struggling to make ends meet, living paycheck to paycheck, agonising in the social media echo chambers about ""is this what life is? Cos I'd rather die tbh"". There's a lot of discontent and a growing inequality, access to resources is getting harder, it just seems to me that they're programming behaviours into people to avoid confrontation and reward seeking, much like people as you say ""being too lazy to act on opportunities, even when they're staring them in the face"". Isn't that indicative of a deeper mental or social problem?

I think modern Life is breaking a lot of people, to the point where they are afraid or indifferent to act selfishly or seek to improve themselves, and it's normalised by social media echoing back their thoughts.

Another thing to add while I'm here...

$5-6 dollar coffees. The pure expense of caffeine is just a fashionable money pit these days, and to my eyes, adds weight to my argument that I tried to make, that they're sinking your money in any way they can. Expensive coffee, a brutal amount of streaming services, all these little expenses add up and keep people poor. They're actively trying to keep people poor, because it's in their best interest.

Perspective is one of the most important parts of understanding, but it's hard to see things from the side of mega corporations and governments. What I'm saying makes sense to me, but to others might come across as looney-speak. At least it did when I tried explaining this to my S.O."

I think there's a goal in mind, and they're disguising their moves in the game they're playing, in order to not cause alarm.

They're managing and controlling the populations thoughts, motives, needs to keep them from adding to the growing problems of environmental disaster, overpopulation etc. It's a sly, psychological game.
