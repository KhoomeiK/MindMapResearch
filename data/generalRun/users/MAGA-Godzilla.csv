Formula for [kinetic energy](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/ke.html) carried by a moving mass KE=1/2 m v^2

If one car of mass m is moving with velocity v it carries 1/2 m v^2 Joules of energy.  If there are two cars (identical mass and identical speed) there would be 2*(1/2 m v^2) or mv^2 Joules of energy.

Total energy is conserved. If all kinetic energy is lost, that energy must go somewhere. We can assume it goes into thermal energy (via work/deformations) on the material making up the cars/wall.

Bringing two identical cars to a stop requires dissipating twice as much energy as bringing one car to a stop (mass and velocity the same).

As has been noted by other and myself, the mythbusters second experiment was still flawed as they did not account for the fact that car-car collision and car-wall collisions have different collision times (and thus different internal forces) due to the car-car collision having two crumple zones to contribute to the collision time."
