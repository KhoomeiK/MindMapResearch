Otherwise teaching Drop is going to be a good next step."

wow,fgm3iw5,t1_fglnynb,1580917315.0,"I mean, the problem with ""interesting"" systems is that it tends to be an RNG fuck fest if you even get access to a playstyle. We've got the worst the other direction here where it's both boring and creates giant skews in DPS depending on your drop luck. I'd much rather make loot super boring (There is ilvl which determines damage/stamina/armor, nothing more) and then more talents that actually effect how you play"
wow,fgm2kic,t1_fgm1c6y,1580916712.0,"Yeah, if you're just playing it for the progression then you probably don't actually like the PvP, the motivation for a normal PvP game comes from getting better and having fun with the game.

But like, that's okay, WoW PvP has never been good as a competitive game mode so let people who enjoy progression have it"
wow,fgiyxz7,t3_eyr0tr,1580833796.0,"The basic issue here is that the more alt friendly you make an expansion the more you have to end up capping the ability for people to be rewarded for playing. Something like Legion is on the far right end of the spectrum, where you want to be constantly be grinding out a single spec because you don't want to fall behind the rest of the playerbase. Thus you always have something to do but can't afford to split your attention.

A more alt friendly expansion is going to have to cap that; you'll have to get massively diminishing returns from the grind, timegating your progress, in order to make it such that you don't lose much by spending your time gearing alts.

Now, I think BFA managed to make exactly the wrong decisions here in how they gave increasing power, as the stuff you have to do for essences doesn't tend to be fun compared to gearing activities (making raiders do PvP for instance or grinding rep) plus said essences really just have a one time grind for each rather than a smooth increase.

The big push from Blizzard over the past few years is to make everything rewarding in some manner to keep you logging on. It's basically the exact opposite take from their main competitor in Square-Enix which all but encourages raid logging. If you move away from the rewards and towards a more alt-friendly game you'll likely see lots of complaints about how there's nothing more to do on their main character other than wait to the reset. The current balance sucks, but it's understandable given what they've all but said their KPIs are.

Like the answer here to split this knot is to make power account wide but boy would there be hate on that."

dogs,fggn52v,t3_ey9urb,1580765324.0,"So I have an apartment without any exits other than the front door. Lyn thus doesn't have to wear her collar inside because there's really no worry about her getting out and she's velcro enough that she doesn't want to leave without us anyways. However when people come over the collar comes out because the door is going to be opening and closing a bunch so it's a just in case thing.

For family and friends who have homes with land the collar is always on, largely because it means they can just open the back door to let the dog out and not have to worry much about the dog getting out without a collar."

wow,fgffx3k,t1_fgc9iul,1580737583.0,"On most of them you probably don't, most of the changes have come from better understanding how to make good rotational design. There was a lot of clunk before that didn't add much while each expansion tends to add more focus on what makes a class fun.

There are exceptions, DRK is a shadow of its former self, MCH gets a complete rework each expansion, and there are some DRG/MNK partisans who prefer the older Geir/Tornado Kick rotations. But even then there's more satisfaction with class design overall in ShB than previous expansions"

dogs,fffacma,t3_et5zro,1579879573.0,"The two big checkmarks I have for ""when is a dog ready for the park"" are when you've tested them with several other dogs and they were fine AND when you have a great recall.

wow,ff20zhs,t3_eqx87t,1579490896.0,"I think it's useful to look at the negatives of pre-endstate Legion and see how they changed.

Spec locked AP made you want to focus a single spec
Catchup required log in with resources making it very alt unfriendly
Legendary system was super RNG and could screw you due to balance issues
Bad phasing issues on WQs
Crazy time and rep gates
Massive class pruning

So the first two got fixed; we now have a universal grind system which automatically gets easier to grind and you get large catchups on an alt.

The legendary system got killed along with the artifact and weapon slots in exchange for Azerite. Compared to end game Legion this feels like a step down; you now have to hope for weapon drops again (which feels terrible for dual wielding classes compared to those who don't) while before it was normalized in that everyone had 3 slots for traits. You're also limited in how you can farm the traits to your weekly chest + raid as opposed to before when they could drop from anything. The balance is not really any better but they're trying to give you a better shot at the good stuff in the newest raid at least.

The phasing issues got solved by killing the autogroups which makes doing WQ a bigger chore. Not fun.

Still see those time and rep gates, although they're slightly less terrible?

Classes got even more pruned until we got Essences which just genericed the classes up a bit; even then I'd say we're still behind due to the loss of legendaries.


The problem I think is that they wanted something new, fresh, and exciting for BfA... and ended up trying to reinvent the wheel. Just keep the slotting system from Legion on your new Azerite traits! Make a new talent row for the former legendary stuff or artifact traits!"
