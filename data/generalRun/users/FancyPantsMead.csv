AskReddit,ffbp4be,t3_esjj44,1579776669.0,"My husband's mom died in a car wreck when he was 17. Hit by a logging truck who blew through their stop sign.   

Father in law received a huge settlement.  Plus their life insireande policies.   He had family and friends constantly begging him for money . Not little amounts. Like help keep start a restaurant type of money.  He didbt want my husband and his sister to go through that so he tied it up in a tryst pretty well. He helps if something major is going on. Like when my husband list his job because he was dealing with my health issues, he paid for some things like mortgage and our cars til he got back on our feet. We're  still getting there but it's for the best. It will be in our control once he passes.  But people assume we're loaded and ask for loans all the time. 

Like dude we have no income at the moment. No.  But what about your moms money. You mean my dads money? She was married when she passed that all went to him. There is no us money. 

My sister in law has it in her head this is her estate money.  Like no. That's not at all how it's set up.  You're just asking people to take advantage.  

If there's an actual need it will be met but it's not a give me give me situation.  People suck. 

We paid for my grandma's funeral. She died very suddenly and very unexpectedly.  At the time we had two incomes and enough saved up for what my grandma wanted. A cremation and a memorial service.  Not extravagant but exactly what she wanted.

 My grandpa couldnt do that. I knew it, my husband knew it. And when my grandma's siblings were pushing to have her buried with a flashy show hounding my grandpa they would only pay if it was that.( That's not what she wanted at all. What jerks.  ) 

my husband quietly went to grandpa alone and told him do whatever you want to do for her and we will cover it grandpa.  (God I love this man) . We didbt even discuss it. He just offered it and knew it's what I would want to do.  

Family knew grandpa couldnt afford to do anything so when he turned down her siblings people assumed it was us.  Started asking for money. Thinking my husband got his dads money. No. Just no.  You people suck. Even if we had ot, it would never be something their addict selves would ever benefit from.  Screw those people. They suck."

 Then my son started having them at age 8. I never thought about the migraines being inherited.  Everytime he's down with one I feel like the shittiest person for giving this to him. I know it's a severe thing to most people  who gave them once in a while. Imagine they go on for weeks and nothing imaginable helps.  That's the torture I may have passed on to him.  

All of my 4 siblings have had a handful of migraines in their life. So clearly there is an inheritable trait to them. 

I haven't had a day without migraines pain in the last 294 days and counting. Mine started exactly like my sons. Abdominal migraines starting at age 3. 

 They didnt really think of that when I was that age but as I got older and they are understood more we realized exactly what they were. Mystery tummy pain was finally solved.

 When my son started the same pattern I took him to a neurologist asap. We were able to deal with them. He's very responsive to simple easy treatment  and they pass after a few hrs. 

 Hopefully since he is a boy they will chill out after puberty and they will never be chronic like mine. He already responds a lot better to meds then I ever did. We're hopeful. But hes had to make a lot of changes. 

 All because I've passed this bullshit migraine gene on to him. I really didnt know to think about it. I also wasn't supposed to be able to get pregnant.  But he happened and he's the best parts of my husband and I. I cant imagine a world without him. I just wish we could solve this thing for him.
