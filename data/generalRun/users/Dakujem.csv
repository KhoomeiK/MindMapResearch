CozyPlaces,ff93chj,t1_ff8uikg,1579703836.0,"I'm sorry to hear this. It's such a meaningless thing for an internet stranger to say to you, but I'm truly sorry to read your story. You're entering a new, unexpected, unwanted phase in your life and it's a scary mess.

The first year is obviously going to be the hardest, but you *will* get through it. Friends and family are an immense help, as is exercise, but it's going to be bloody tough for a while. You'll have good days and you'll have bad days. One moment you'll find yourself elated at the prospect of life being like an open book in front of you, the next you'll find yourself unexpectedly crying in traffic. It's going to be a roller coaster, but you *will* survive.

Three years ago my ex-wife had an affair with another man she met at her gym. When I discovered it, she claimed she ""had no choice"" and ran off with him. The result on my being was indescribable. I thought that sort of thing happened to *other* couples. Weeks later, I found myself going to a therapist because I was pretty dinged-up, mentally. I needed to know how long the anxiety attacks would go on for. I needed to know for how many more months I'd be fighting back random tears on the train. The answer he gave me is that the highs and lows will be like waves, after dropping a rock into a pond. Soon they'll reduce into ripples. Eventually, those highs and lows will smooth out, and normality will resume. The time this takes is different for each individual, but you will get through it. Just don't be hard on yourself when you're battling with the low moments. 

People will tell you unhelpful things, like, ""You'll meet someone new and better,"" etc. They're right, of course, but that sort of talk doesn't help you in your current grief. My only advice is to focus on small steps. Even if it sounds like a cliche, join a gym. Learn a hobby. Write a book (this helped me a great deal. I just published mine on Amazon last week!). Talk to a therapist. Travel. Laugh with friends. It *all* helps and you *will* get through it. 

Then, in perhaps three years from now you'll find yourself looking back at this time, thinking, ""Sh\*t, that was a rough time, but now I'm actually, finally happy. I've met someone better. I've accomplished things. I'm laughing again. Life is going pretty darn good and it's gonna be a bloody good year."" 

Just take it one day at a time. You will be happy again. Life will have meaning again. I promise."
