And I can't blame them. That shit's heavy. If I was stuck in a 90 minute long horror scenario where I was stripped of my awareness of the world other than a child-like sense of wonder that everyone else seems to lack, and forced to confront the inevitability of my own demise in a body that mocks the planned obsolescence of the individual in a society that markets and sells that individuality back to them...well, I'd consider myself cursed too.

Which, considering how that's *pretty much that movie's theme* [with a few songs about disposability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqT2uOa1-d0), [the self in the face of consumerism and rapid modernization](https://youtu.be/dOWUgioSvsE?list=PL53238CD7D7C45B59), [and accepting the subtle body horror of old age ](https://youtu.be/nOeK0Ig-H9g) for good measure.

* Support for the justice system is a partisan issue because of their two party system. As an example, many judges are elected in the US depending on the state and county. Many police chiefs are also appointed positions by local political figures.

* Gun ownership is common among criminals so police are more heavily armed than many other countries, which leads to more police incidents that result in gun use.

* Police violence towards minorities is pretty normalized. It's not treated as acceptable, but it is often treated as a normal but unfortunate occurrence within the justice system.

* The education of police officers isn't standardized across the entire country and there are different kinds of police across different jurisdictions. As such, many officers receive insufficient training.

dndnext,fef93gm,t1_feeq2fa,1579051081.0,"Yeah, that's what I was trying to communicate. When the character is only there because the player is, it can really break the suspension of disbelief and cause unnecessary tension."
dndnext,fedzgar,t1_fedyjpc,1579023138.0,"That does sound a bit better already, though I'm not certain why there'd be a reason for him to care about the ""darkness"" bit  given that the guy doesn't seem to have emotions. And if the character cares based off of their code of honor, then they'd really be more LE than CE already.

Honestly, I'd bring this up at your session 0. Talk to the players about your character and the end-goal you have in mind for his development, and then let them know that it will require more work in some ways but will (hopefully) pay off. They're the ones who have to deal with it and should understand the risks of dealing with this archetype and how it can complicate things for better or worse."
dndnext,fedpcy5,t1_fectmd2,1579016986.0,"I'm with you there. This doesn't sound that interesting to me; in the best case scenario, the character is ""just there"" and does what he's told. There's no conflict and no struggle. The character is already fully developed without much room for organic personal growth. 

These sorts of characters are always problematic to me, because they put the onus of justifying why that character would be there on everyone else. Other players will often have to metagame to keep the other player at the table. ""Oh, you killed a kid?"" says the lawful good Paladin of Lathlander, ""Well he *was* kind of a dick, but you're on thin ice."" Coincidentally, the CE lizardfolk has always been on thin ice and wasn't even aware that ice came in other thicknesses. 

Or, other players are put in the situation of developing the character for the player to keep the character around. From a narrative standpoint, this can be legitimately interesting if done right. Gollum from LoTR (mostly in the movies) is a famous example of this; Frodo saw a dark side of himself in him and thought he was worth saving, but Sam saw the thing that Frodo was becoming and rejected him outright. Gollum then grew attached to Frodo and had to reconcile this with himself, before his ultimate betrayal and unwitting affirmation of both viewpoints. However, this means that the players are basically put at the helm of character development if done right, or else there's no reason that they'd want them around. The  fact that Gollum was even there was the focal point of a struggle between Sam and Frodo, but if both characters were more like Sam in this situation, the Gollum-player would've had to roll up a new character before the adventure even began.


IMO, it's a concept that doesn't translate well to this medium. And given that it's a fairly two dimensional concept with a few foreign mannerisms that the party might enjoy and a monotone reptillian voice that they'll likely find endearing,  it's also the sort of character that a DM could more successfully realize as an NPC."

The only gripes I have are that there are a few spelling errors (""scolarship"" on page 2 should be spelled ""scholarship, as one example) and there are a few jokes that I'm guessing didn't translate. Schools in the US aren't named numerically, they're named after dead presidents, political figures, or the rich descendants of former slave owners.  So no school in the western world would be called ""420"", even if there were 419 other schools. School districts might be, but people don't  usually use those in casual conversation.

pcgaming,fdz8ixq,t3_en9c87,1578787712.0,"##Spoilers below:

I actually just finished a playthrough of The Witcher 2 after watching the Netflix series. I bought it on sale about 6 years ago, but my hardware wasn't good enough to run it satisfactorily, so I wound up letting it get stale in my Steam library for a while.

It was pretty phenomenal and the graphics held up nicely. I had some issues with a few sections, and encountered a couple glitches that bricked quests and made it impossible to get the playthrough experience I wanted.

The writing and dialogue were both great. The combat had a high learning curve but a low skill ceiling that had a lot of variability in how you could approach enemies. The main quest was great and the sidequests were interesting and well written, with the exception of the contracts that had you deal with specific monster species in each area. They were the standard variety ""collect 10 zombie eyeballs"" or ""destroy 5 nests"" that are common for these sorts of games. 

The monster species each felt unique but there wasn't much variety. There are few main monsters that you'd see just about everywhere in the game and a couple different ones that were unique to each act. It helped make each act feel a bit different from one another, although the battles became a bit of a slog after I'd killed my 100th Endrega Warrior in that section of the game.

Crafting was fairly entertaining and I enjoyed collecting new weapons and armor. Though I generally found myself just buying or crafting most of my equipment at the beginning of each act and didn't need to replace anything, except if I stumbled on a sword that was a slight improvement over the one I made.

The weakest part, in my opinion, were the boss battles. The first major boss battle against the Kayran, a giant kraken-like creature, felt more like I was fighting the mechanics that the game introduced during the fight than the creature itself. I died quite a few times before I discovered the parameters of the fight and the patterns of the tentacles, which was fine for Dark Souls but neither the combat nor the hitboxes in The Witcher 2 are tight enough to make this style of gameplay worthwhile. It didn't help that if you tried to circle around the creature or even just tried to get out of its field of vision, you were hit with an unavoidable tentacle attack that slapped you right back to the position that the game wanted you to be.

Though the Kayran is a special example, the rest of the boss fights just were really just too bland to be notable. Mostly I just found myself excited to take down each boss because I was looking forward to moving the story along. 


Overall, I'd give it an 8/10. I had a great experience with it and am just beginning the Witcher 3."

Australia uses a hybrid electoral system that's a lot like the Westminster parliamentary system of the UK and Canada, among other commonwealth countries, but with an elected senate that must approve all legislation passed by the house.  

The Australian senate has some conventions borrowed from the US, including that 12 senators are elected from the six Australian states and two from the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. However, there are 76 Senators total. Still, the hybrid system fosters  a regionalism that isn't helped by state boundaries; 

* The largest goods export of New South Wales, the most populous state (7.544 Million, 2014), was coal with 17 billion AUD. This sum was greater than its next 9 largest exports. [PDF Warning: Source, Australia's Trade by State and Territory, p.16](https://dfat.gov.au/about-us/publications/Documents/australias-trade-by-state-and-territory-2017-18.pdf)

* By comparison, the largest goods export of Victoria, the second most populous state (6.359 Million, 2017), was wool with 2.1 billion AUD. 

* Queensland, the third most populous state, exported 33.2 billion AUD worth of coal, nearly *doubling* the coal export of NSW.

* Western Australia, the fourth most populous state, exported 8% of the world's liquefied natural gas (LNG).  [Using a different source on this one since the aforementioned document doesn't give a specific number.](https://www.jtsi.wa.gov.au/invest-in-wa/sector/resource-services/oil-gas) 

* South Australia's largest goods export was alcoholic beverages with 1.9 billion AUD, which isn't relevant to this post but it does reaffirm my next vacation destination.


So basically, what you have is a system  that reinforces regionalism, combined with an economy that is deeply reliant on fossil fuels. Then you have to understand that the rural populations of just about any country are less educated than urban populations, and that this particular country's electoral system favors politicians that cater to regional interests.

I'm not trying to say that this is the *only* reason. Just that it's a significant contributing factor that's generally taken for granted. One thing that I think more people need to be talking about is how democratic systems are going to adapt to climate change and, specifically, the way that climate change discussion has become politicized."
