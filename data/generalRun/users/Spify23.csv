You'll also find there is no chocolate in that. Looks like an ice-cream sandwich in which the chocolate biscuits only have coco powder in them.


As a side note; friend of mine would feed their Husky little pieces of chocolate and she was perfectly fine as the amount she was eating was not near a toxic dose. (According to their vet, a small block once a week won't kill her) still doesn't mean I would feed my dog chocolate."
