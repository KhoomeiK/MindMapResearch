Crushes,fdixtq0,t3_ekcoou,1578453500.0,I'm still crushing on J big time. But I don't get to hangout with him as much as i'd like. No clue if he likes me back. But I miss talking to him face to face. Ok & seeing his cute face & hearing his cute laugh. It's been almost 5 months since i started liking him again

Crushes,fdg2xb2,t3_el7bb4,1578378033.0,When he talks about the same bands I like. Which pretty much is half our conversations. We are into Rock & Metal bands. His smile & laugh always puts me in a better mood

disability,fd4v010,t3_ej4dw5,1578171324.0,I belong to a support group. But I hate it. The people there loudly talk on the bus & out In public how they are on disability. I am a private person & because the others in the group blurt out their business & mention I belong to that group. I avoid the group & avoid them in public now. I have hidden disabilities that's not the whole worlds business
Crushes,fd0ik5f,t3_ejqr0w,1578119309.0,Don't think he has this app. I don't want to ask him either
Crushes,fczhlwj,t3_ejjxr4,1578101433.0,"The guy I like is attractive to me. But a few people I should his picture to they said he was ok looking. I think he's cute,nice, funny & cool to talk to. He's the easiest guy In my area to talk to & I find that attractive"
depression,fcvjx0z,t3_ej4x1y,1578003675.0,I did a lot for him. I don't think he appreciated my support through his divorce & other stuff.now I can see why he lost friends several years ago. He's so selfish etc. I thought he was kind etc. I was wrong.but he isn't the first person I regret being nice to. I hate being nice. Sometimes I just want to be mean to protect myself
Crushes,fcukggx,t1_fctm75i,1577983012.0,Thanks the only good thing is. We don't live near each other. He live states away. So I won't ever run into him
Crushes,fcpetlx,t3_ei9nj2,1577860901.0,Well one long term crush off on for almost 2 years. Has showed me his true colors. So I'm pretty much over him. I pretty much have been thinking of ending our friendship of 30 years. I'm now going to concentrate on a guy I lost contact with for a few years because I was dealing with health problems. In the 4 months I have reconnected with him. He has stayed in contact with me a lot longer than the other guy who I have known most of my life
Crushes,fcm1axq,t1_fclu8wb,1577761638.0,Wow what a jerk
Crushes,fcln54m,t3_ehseot,1577751705.0,I don't have my crushes number but we are Facebook friends & we hung out a few times. I do 90% of reaching out to him on Facebook Messenger. So I at times worry that I annoy him. But he introduced me to his friends in person. He did contact me a few times on Facebook Messenger. Like on Christmas & 2 times he sent me pictures I had taken with him.but the rest of the time I contacted him first. I just hope he isn't like some guys because there's a bunch of pictures of me with other guys on my Facebook page. But it's just baseball players I meet at games & guys from my favorite bands. But a few ex crushes got mad when I talked to other guys including the baseball players. One guy said to me I thought you were here just to see me. I never told him I liked him.because come on now I don't have a shot with the players. So I don't know why he acted odd. But I think the current guy I like is more mature than a guy I liked 5 years ago
Crushes,fclm6fw,t3_ehtxaw,1577751045.0,"Tell her but I shouldn't give you that advice. Because I'm always a chicken to tell guys I like them. Probably because one jerk laughed in my face & said I know you're joking like you joke with a lot of people. Then a month later he asked me to ask another girl if she liked him. I pretty much hated him after that. Then things got worse & said inappropriate things about me & other guys. That was 5 years ago & I avoided him off & on for years. Then dummy me gave him another chance back in April of 2019
but after about a dozen conversations i knew he was still a jerk"
Crushes,fclkumk,t1_fclg2ld,1577750142.0,Yikes I can hardly handle my feelings for the 2 guys I like. I'd be more  of a mess than I already am. If I liked more than 2

depression,fckqccz,t3_ehg34e,1577730905.0,I know the feeling but when I get affection I freeze. It's because I'm afraid of crying in public more than anything.both my parents when I was younger & before my mom died in 2016 all they did was hit me & verbally abuse me for decades
Crushes,fckpdpj,t3_ehmcf6,1577730314.0,Good luck & happy birthday
Crushes,fckovvq,t3_ehpdpt,1577730007.0,I wish I knew how to handle that. I have crushes on 2 guy friends right now ugh. One doesn't live near but I still like him. The other I hangout with about once a month. I talk to him more than anyone In the room. So a girl might like you if she talks to you more than others. But as females are not all alike
Crushes,fckojrl,t3_ehpdxe,1577729803.0,Almost sounds like the guy I like
Crushes,fckof0k,t3_ehn3ta,1577729722.0,"Thanks I have 2 crushes & I'm constantly over thinking this about them both. One I worry more about then the other.

Plus we got In a little text argument"

adultery,fcjh5jj,t3_ehi001,1577687418.0,I like younger guys. But I'm 49 & guys my age where I live look older than they are. Which is a turn off. I like someone that's 38 that actually looks his age

Crushes,fcj9zyf,t1_fcj6tsr,1577680992.0,We hangout but it's pretty much related to concerts. I'm a bit of a chicken about asking
Crushes,fcj7x0h,t3_ehdphg,1577679513.0,Not 100% sure yet if my current crush actually likes me back or is just a good guy. That's trying to be a good friend. But I will take things either way. Because growing up & still today in my late 40's.i get along better with men than women. On Facebook due to a crazy ex boyfriend. I don't use my full first & last name. I told him that a few months ago. Well last time I saw him in person he softly said my full name when his friends where near us. he said a few days before Christmas he'd check up on me on Facebook In a few days to on Christmas. I got a little open with him & told him i'm not close to my family so I wasn't spending the holidays alone. Well he didn't forget & he contacted me via Facebook Messenger. Even if he just likes me as a friend or concert buddy. His kindness to me is appreciated & I don't want to blow this friendship over a crush. He's just a cool guy to hang out with & I don't want to lose that
Crushes,fcj6p5k,t3_eheozf,1577678616.0,Just flat out tell her. I myself rather a guy be totally be upfront with me. It might hurt a little. But I myself want to know before he drives me crazy. Do you want to be her friend at least? If not don't tell her you want to be her friend either.unless you actually want to be here friend. Ok honesty hurts but don't waste her time. I myself rather be let down then wonder if a guy even thinks of me as a friend
Crushes,fcj5ub2,t3_ehgkix,1577678003.0,I don't have problems talking to my crush. Except for telling him how I feel about him. A few months ago he was pretty much in my face & I thought he was about to kiss me. I got nervous & I backed away from him. He also called me cute that night & that I look good for my age. I got really nervous & that's the only time I couldn't talk to him. Plus last time I saw him. I got the feeling when he was tuning his guitar a distance from me he was laughing that cute laugh with that cute smile of his. I think he was talking to the lead singer of the band about me. But I could be wrong. I get the feeling at times he likes me. But I could be wrong. I could be wrong & he just likes me as a friend & is just being a nice guy. If not that he just likes the attention & he's playing me for a fool. I don't know I don't read guys well
Crushes,fch12dn,t3_eh5awq,1577646194.0,"Still like J like a lot. Want to tell him but don't want to lose his friendship. Because we have gotten closer as friends the last few months. But I'm so attracted to his smile, laugh & personality. I'm always in a better mood around him, after I'm around him & after hearing from him on Facebook. I just worry he knows I like him & he just likes the attention I give him & doesn't actually like me"
Crushes,fc7mtv9,t3_egmmun,1577512658.0,That's why I don't really tell close guy friends if I have crushes on them
Crushes,fc4xc1s,t3_eg7p7c,1577432414.0,Black because he's got dark brown almost black hair. Black Tattoos & wears black glasses at times
depression,fc4vbyg,t3_efyc5z,1577429890.0,I know the feeling like a male friend right now. I wake up thinking about him & go to sleep thinking about him
adultery,fc4rbvi,t3_eg6sei,1577425573.0,"Not in love or lust with a boss but a old friend whose married with kids. He talks about his 2 kids all the time & smiles. But like not one word about his wife since October.but he told me he was married in October & then nothing since. I admit I'm wondering what's going on.one of his friends told me when my crush was not around. That my crush is miserable at his job & personal life. But looks happy when I'm around.his smile & laugh turns me on but drives me crazy all at the same time. I haven't made a move on him. I just talk to him like a friend. I have known him longer than 4 months. I just lost touch with him for a few years because I was dealing with some health problems & personal problems. I don't want to blow our friendship but damn I'm really attracted to him & not just for his looks. He's cute, nice, funny & we have a lot in common.this is the first married man I have ever had feelings for. He doesn't hit on me but constantly tells me how great I look for my age. After he found out my age & i'm almost 11 years younger than him. The next time I saw him he loudly told all his friends & half the concert venue how young & great I look for my age. I only see him about once a month. So we stay in touch a lot of Facebook Messenger a few times a week. Glad I don't work with the guy. Because I don't know if I could work with someone I like so much. I feel like he might be attracted to me but at times I think it's just my imagination. But I feel like there's something behind his awkward laugh & smile whenever we talk. I just want to know if he feels the sexual tension to or is it just my wishful thinking"
Crushes,fc4q6sk,t3_eg5t4h,1577424455.0,Just have fun talking to her & go from there
Crushes,fc49wqq,t3_eg2vpl,1577410605.0,"His bands songs. Other bands his 2 bands opened for all remind me of my crush. I use to go to a lot of rock concerts he played at or hung out at. Not a groupie more like a lover of rock music. He's only the second guy in a band I have had a crush on. But I like him not because he's in 2 local bands. It's because we like a lot of the same music, he is nice & friendly to me when others stick their noses up at me.he's a all around nice guy on top of being cute & funny"
