politics,ffd92jq,t1_ffd8a5j,1579815811.0,"You are 100% wrong. My father and his entire family were born in Ukraine (he emigrated during WWII). Yes, Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, but if you called him a Russian, that would result in a fight. Russia was an SSR, and if you were born there or happened to be of Russian descent and lived in another SSR, then you were Russian. Russia does not equal the Soviet Union. By that same logic, Georgians, Latvians, Lithuanian, Estonians, and anyone from all other SSRs are Russian."
