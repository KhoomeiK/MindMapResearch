mlb,ff1dz4b,t1_ff1deyc,1579477964.0,"Of course a Houston fan wants to “mOvE oN wItH yOUR liVeS”. Bregman is getting toasted just as much if not more.   I legit saw a Bregman meme where he’s wearing a butt plug. Altuve is only getting heat because of the video of him not wanting to take his shirt off. You wanna sweep this under the rug or make it about other things but it’s about cheating plain and simple.   Altuve, Srpinger, Verlander , Bregman the whole organization is tainted by this."
