PS4,feplkrk,t1_fepld1y,1579323699.0,"True, but when have they ever put out crappy games? If anything just adding online exclusive contents to one game that is nearly 7 years old would be hurting more."
PS4,fepl87y,t1_fepi4ut,1579323435.0,That's how they got built up originally though. And there weren't really quality concerns then.

Oh and my second choice would be dogs. Because the world would suck without them."

Put the fences on all stairs, entrances, doors, etc. Put the ultimate in there when you're done so you can take pop shots out at enemies without fear of your shields being destroyed when out of cells/bats.

2. I've never tried this yet. I'll attempt it later today.
3. I actually worried that updating my drivers caused the issue at one point, so I did a system restore. That ended up not working.
4. CPU temps never go above 55-56 degrees Celsius under load.

I'm going to also be looking at the power supply later. After some research last night, I have a feeling that might be the culprit."

Then there's the issue of it turning on when off which is weird."
Windows10,fdhazho,t1_fdhaflm,1578419139.0,"I'm going to try rolling back. I don't think an update happened recently, but can't be 100% sure. I haven't touched the CPU power switch since I built the thing over a year ago, but I'll check to make sure no dust got in there. My one friend did suggest that it could be a stuck button though. Not too sure about that."
Coffee,fcz7iqn,t3_ejitua,1578095245.0,"Yeah. It's pretty similar to beers as in it's an acquired taste. It tastes crappy at first, but then the more you expose yourself to it the better it tastes and the more flavor profiles you can pick out."
