AskAnAmerican,fe2d4nm,t1_fdw4fmd,1578837070.0,That’s kind of you :’)
TooAfraidToAsk,fe2cyqv,t1_fduuzxx,1578837008.0,"Hi, sorry I’ve been away from reddit lately due to exam season here. Thanks I’ll check it out."
offmychest,fdl1nbt,t1_fdh5yil,1578515489.0,Nope
offmychest,fdg9q8s,t1_fdfpz9f,1578386144.0,You are a good man.
AskAnAmerican,fdegqf6,t1_fdefe6d,1578338661.0,"Besides what you hear in the media, Iran has lots of wonderful historical and “cultural” sites.

AskAnAmerican,fdeclbs,t1_fdec1zs,1578336080.0,I’m 21 too.
AskAnAmerican,fdeasba,t1_fde6wyc,1578334949.0,"I’m a girl, so you probably will not see me with a gun.

Also, I hope you succeed in whatever your goals are! (As long as it doesn’t involve killing innocents) ;)"
AskAnAmerican,fde5rv0,t1_fddyief,1578331792.0,"This whole conversation saddens me. Good people who do not know each other, are talking about killing and dying for the interests of some politicians who probably don’t care about us. I hope there won’t be any war."
AskAnAmerican,fddp92f,t1_fddnmk6,1578320236.0,"Thanks for your caring. It’s not easy to get out of the country. I hope it won’t take that far, but being on Reddit and speaking English makes me no different from my family and friends and other decent people from my country, if it comes to dying for my country."
AskAnAmerican,fddg7di,t1_fdddpxl,1578310865.0,I live and study in Iran. I don’t know much about war times and military so I can’t say for sure.
AskAnAmerican,fddg5os,t1_fdddix9,1578310803.0,"As far as I know, it’s done up to a point. What I mean is that they do not arrest everyone who protests online, but there has been cases of arresting admins of channels or big pages which say “bad things”."
AskAnAmerican,fdd98dt,t1_fd21geq,1578300702.0,"Reddit is still open to access in Iran. The problem is, reddit is not a popular app in Iran and the population of Iranian redditors is relatively low."
AskAnAmerican,fdd934l,t1_fd3tkbr,1578300493.0,"Iranian here. What do you exactly mean by monitoring? In comparison to china where even google doesn’t work, iran is somehow better. Some of the most famous social medias which are blocked are: Twitter, Facebook, Youtube and Telegram (which was and is the most popular texting app in Iran). But google, instagram, whatsapp, reddit, wikipedia, ... work. One thing to consider is that since Telegram was blocked, everyone in the country has been using VPNs which give us access to all websites previously blocked."
memes,fdb3xe2,t1_fdalzcj,1578253453.0,War has never been fair.
memes,fdajanz,t1_fdaj8u9,1578246688.0,That’s my current objective.
AskAnAmerican,fd1u5sl,t1_fd1tdtr,1578136863.0,Good idea! I’ll think about it! Now that I think about it every country should have one. Thanks ;)
AskAnAmerican,fd1olih,t1_fd0ax5b,1578134350.0,"Iranian here, contrary to popular belief, Iranians do not wear Burka."
offmychest,fd1fz5n,t1_fczywuj,1578130861.0,Thanks!
offmychest,fcxybtp,t1_fcxxols,1578072144.0,"That’s sad to hear. 

As we do not want to be viewed the same as our government, we do not hold Americans accountable for your government’s actions."
offmychest,fcxwr2t,t1_fcxwev5,1578071608.0,Thanks!
offmychest,fcxtbwv,t1_fcxp9lf,1578070112.0,"You do not need to apologize for what your politicians do, neither do I. 

Patriotism arises during times of war, which leads to forgetting that everyone is alike! I hope it won’t take that far. Thanks, my friend!"
offmychest,fcxig1d,t1_fcxfmsm,1578063731.0,I hope your family will be safe! And i hope all this fear will end soon!
offmychest,fcxc25i,t3_ejdc6m,1578058791.0,That’s horrible. I wonder how much of the porn out there is actually made from sex trafficking victims.
offmychest,fcx3b8f,t1_fcx3akt,1578049371.0,Thanks!
offmychest,fcx2iv9,t1_fcx1lfb,1578048357.0,"I plan to study Master’s somewhere else, but that won’t happen until about 4 years :("
offmychest,fcx159n,t1_fcx0qzj,1578046569.0,"But you said why iranians did not do anything about killings in Iraq, like it is our fault. Anyway, here I am, a 21YO female college student who doesn’t understand much about international relations, hoping that this will not cause a great war. And i hope you’ll be safe wherever you are. That’s all."
offmychest,fcx0yyd,t1_fcx0y8g,1578046337.0,I hope so! Thanks for the support.
offmychest,fcx0wny,t1_fcx0ctw,1578046252.0,"Honestly, Iran is not like Europe where you can leave your country easily. And I’m just 21YO and there is absolutely nothing I can do except for hoping everyone will come out safe out of this conundrum."
offmychest,fcx0ld2,t1_fcx0e6j,1578045848.0,What you are saying is like Iranians holding all Americans accountable for what Trump did.
offmychest,fcx01m9,t1_fcwztu1,1578045123.0,"I understand what you say. But believe me, as normal citizens, we cannot do anything about it! If you followed iranian news, many were killed for protesting against the rise in gas price. We haven’t been able to influence such an internal matter. How do you say we are responsible for what happened in Iraq? Many people in Iran do not support the government anyway."
offmychest,fcwzprd,t1_fcwzdg7,1578044695.0,Thanks!
offmychest,fcwznie,t1_fcwzesj,1578044612.0,"As I said, I’m not talking about who he was. I don’t support innocent lives being lost no matter who they are and where they are. I’m just talking about the consequences. If there is a war, everyone will be affected."
MadeMeSmile,fcmqedt,t3_ehw8gg,1577787063.0,What is his channel about?
natureismetal,fcjjja8,t3_ehcf4w,1577690093.0,What causes those patterns?
