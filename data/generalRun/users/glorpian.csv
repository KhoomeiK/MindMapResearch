gaming,ffb4k8p,t1_ffaxeye,1579751618.0,"That's kind of the thing though... A base game these days is the exception. You're much much much more likely to get a ""base"" game where a very handsome percentage is locked behind a paywall. All developed and ready to play with, except you need to pay a bit more to do so. You may even be put on a timer to pay before the game comes out. You argue that the micro transactions are there to generate enough profit to sponsor more content... like what? more hats? Unless the game sells well, no studio is going to make an expansion mate. It's not like expansions and sequels were a foreign concept to old games. You still got them if the game sold well.  
  
This day and age, paying for games has essentially been refined down to minimum effort, and minimum risk from the developers' side, big companies and indie devs alike. This opened up the field to much shittier games developed by your neighbourhood nerd. And we embrace it. Fund tons of monies into projects that have a cool idea tagline without knowing if the guys behind it can code at all, much less make the game a reality. Certainly there's golden gems amongst the rubble but the vast majority of it is garbage. The bit that people tend to take issue with, is how big companies exploit the semi-broken systems that got made to support the off-brand developers. But I guess we have what we deserve since it's clear that most people don't really give a hoot.

Der er sket rigtigt mange ting siden du og jeg gik i skole. Bl.a. er der rigtigt mange tiltag omkring dokumentering, f.eks. individuelle handleplaner for udvikling af eleven i hvert eneste fag. Alt sammen er arbejdsopgaver der hober sig op og tager reel undervisningstid væk fra lærerne.  
De ekstra timer der blev lagt ind er hovedsageligt ""aktivitets timer"" hvor ideen har været at blande undervisning med aktiviteter i såkaldt ""leg-og-læring"", øget bevægelse og lektiehjælp. Til det er der primært ansat pædagoger fremfor lærere. I det store hele var det et opgør med SFO'en fremfor reelt mere undervisning.

If one starts out poor it doesn't sound like a stretch to say that they'd consider you rich, even if you don't. Similarly rich kids would be able to live with the means you have, and live comfortably - but depending on how they're brought up and who they associate with they might not feel that way.

Jeg brugte netop metrobyggeriet fordi det er et meget sammenligneligt stort byggeri og samtidig har været en af de mest udskældte og bødebelagte byggerier herhjemme grundet kummerlige arbejdsforhold. Det er blevet udskudt adskillige gange, strukket ud pga støjgener, senere omlagt til døgnarbejde, arme og ben er gået tabt i arbejdsskader, og der har været adskillige klager om sultelønninger. Alt sammen ting vi i Danmark ""ikke vil acceptere"" som du selv skriver. Til trods for det har vi jo altså en metro. Blot meget meget forsinket.  
  
Den handlekraft jeg nu især vil påpege er den politiske. Vi kan snildt blive enige om at netop den handlekraft ofte har katastrofale menneskelige omkostninger, men når det bliver brugt på noget vi alle kan slutte op om, som f.eks. grøn energi er det sgu et lyspunkt i mørket af vestlig ubeslutsomhed og dovenskab. Har du måske glemt vores fine planer om at købe os til alle de CO2 kvoter vi ikke kunne nå, med penge vi indad vandt bl.a. på at lempe kravene til vores landbrugssektor. Det er ikke særlig målrettet og ambitiøst og istedet har vi nu en ret drastisk miljøpakke for at prøve at indhente bare lidt af det tabte, og leve op til det vi lovede. Mange af de ""beskidte"" jobs sender vi ud af landet og så er det pludselig ikke vores opgave at begrænse det mere, ligesom vi tager nul-ansvar for de ting vi importerer. At eksportere vores problemer og så pege fingre er også meget meget svært at hylde mester. Måske skulle vi bare allesammen erkende at mennesker generelt er ret dårlige til at passe på hinanden og deres omgivelser, så snart det ligger ud over egen næsetip.  
  
Vi Europæere kan naturligvis også som Amerika vente på de ""gode"" firmaer der ser mulighed og profit i den grønne energi, men så tager det altså bare en anden form for tid. Især ikke hvis du venter på at de også naturligt skal blomstre op i Indien, Brasilien, og Kina. Tid vi ikke har."

Dér hvor jeg tillader mig at være lidt positiv er at Kineserne i modsætning til mange af os i vesten udviser en helt anden handlekraft. F.eks. udvidede de på to år deres metro-net med 8 *linjer* mens københavn's metro stadig knoklede med at få kongens nytorv iorden.  
  
Kina har i udpræget stil valgt at kaste penge efter grøn energi, og næsten alle løsninger der viser en god effekt bliver støttet,  [eksempel](https://www.studioroosegaarde.net/project/smog-free-tower). Det har givet pote. Til trods for vanvittig stigning i strømforbrug formår Kina stadig at øge deres andel af grøn energi,  [kilde](https://chinapower.csis.org/energy-footprint/). Et fint eksempel på hvor meget prioritet det har er bl.a. denne artikel fra [fortune.com](https://fortune.com/2019/12/07/russia-china-gas-pipeline/) der diskuterer hvordan den nye mega-gasledning fra Rusland til Kina blev færdig i december 2019 lidt før planlagt, men at den ikke ser ud til at komme til at give overskud for nogen af parterne i lang tid. Kina har desuden gået meget stille med dørene omkring et Japansk initiativ ""[Asia Super Grid](https://www.eco-business.com/news/is-the-future-of-renewable-energy-in-asia-to-share-it/)"" og et Australsk projekt ""[Trans-Asean Gas & Electricity Grid](https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/southeast-asia-en-route-to-pan-asian-energy-network/)"". Projekterne går ud på i større grad at forbinde Asiens energi net sådan at man bedre kan udnytte grøn energi fra alle parter (første har fokus på Rusland, Japan, Korea, Kina, anden har fokus på sydøst-Asien og Australien), lidt på [samme måde](https://ing.dk/artikel/spoerg-fagfolket-hvorfor-eksporterer-vi-vindmoellestroem-vi-selv-kunne-forbruge-213767) som vi eksporterer energi når det blæser eller køber norsk el fra vandkraft når det er vindstille - blot større skala.  
    
  
Selv om Trump gør hvad han kan for at holde liv i kulkraften, og taler skidt om grøn energi så vinder den stadig frem da grøn energi er blevet bedre rentabelt. Markedet i vesten er nået til et punkt hvor der peges imod grøn energi.
  
  
Kort sagt er dem om hvem vi i højeste grad tænker, ""ah de sviner jo bare mere hvis vi passer på,"" hårdt igang med at forsøge at omlægge deres energiproduktion. Det er da positivt.  
  
Hvis det begejstrer lidt, og man synes det er træls, kan man jo altid tage nej-hatten på, og huske på hvordan det er alt for sent at verdenen er kommet igang... Men derfor skal vi nu stadig holde teten i Danmark. Det tjener vi gode penge på når nu de andre så småt har opdaget det er en god idé :)"

First I'll make an assumption it's a question - we're a whole question mark away, and it's unlikely to be eating you up inside, but I'll assume it nonetheless.

Why ""gonna?""  
I chose it of me own free will. I was bored and noticed that it was so ridiculously close to posting that it was out of the ordinary. Normally I browse reddit in hours worth of oldness.  
  
Why ""go""?
Eusocial societies are predominantly flightless so 'go' is a better choice than 'fly'. This is just further the case if you expand the concept to superorganisms, although 'swim' suddenly makes a fine contender too.  
  
Why ""with""?  
Not entirely sure what would constitute against. I guess not posting at all, or making an 'ironic' post mocking the tendency.  
 For the former, I had already established that I was going to remark on the unusual timing. I am not as insecure as an individual as to overthrow my decisions because they're not edgy enough.   
For the latter, I would be posting a comment as to timing anyway, and mocking what could be seen as some sort of Reddit mini-game whilst still participating would make me a hypocrite and look ridiculous.  
  
Why ""the hivemind""?  
The exact choice of wording here refers to my awareness that this is the standard trite and unoriginal posts that haunt and stalk Poem_for_your_sprog. Reddit as a pseudo-superorganism very often behaves like this, to the point that the ""top posts of reddit thread"" had multiple links to a dude creating his own thread complaining about it whilst filling up the commentary section with ecologically reasonable jibber-jabber.

Still, strikes here remain very prolific, mostly succesful, and peaceful.

Min pointe er blot at det kan sagtens gælde alle at stramme op, og at det med kun at gøre det for invandrere er noget pjat der fordrer en usund ""os og dem"" mentalitet.  
  
Desuden vil jeg som svar til dig påpege at det kun gælder for de arbejdsparate, ikke dem som retmæssig burde førtidspensioneres eller lign. Jeg er godt klar over at vi desværre har mange der bliver fanget i systemet fordi det er blevet gjort særdeles vanskeligt :("

Jokes aside that's pretty much it. He paints himself a picture of a real actionable man with balls of steel to do what's necessary. Some people think that's better than a sneak who sits there trying to calculate the consequences and getting stuff done in the quiet."
Denmark,fddqaf6,t1_fddlnx7,1578321101.0,Derfor kan man vel sagtens udvide indsatsen til at ramme alle de syndere der er arbejdsparate men istedet vælger offentlig forsørgelse? Det virker lidt som om man målrettet har valgt en undergruppe fordi det lyder flot til alle de vælgere der går og ønsker strammere udlændingepolitik. Hvis målet er at integrere folk er det tosset at dele det op i dem og os.

American Generals have murdered thousands of civilians in the Middle East and continue to do so. Unlike the actions of the recently deceased you label them as ""accidents"" though, so that's ok. After all, you're there to protect the civilians against the evil dictators... or was it the weapons of mass destruction?... or maybe just protect the oil wells as the commander in chief commanded. As you like to say, we're not privy to all the information after all.  
  
One thing is pretty clear though, our western presence in the middle east is that of an inept policeman failing hard to keep people from atrocious crime."

I put it in quotation marks because multiple people have pointed out already that this group is not as diversified as you might think.  
  
Having loved ones sent off to protect the oilfields of Syria will be a lot harder to blow off than having the professionals, who chose that life, do it. Time magazine had an [article](https://time.com/5696950/bring-back-the-draft/) about why bringing back the draft might help ending these wars instead of having them be a continuous sidenote of normal life."

 The lost and found solves a common practical problem. It costs them nothing, as it's a volunteer service station, and in cases like OP the badges were taken away at even minor opportunity. That's essentially theft, and any reasonable showrunner should know better. If we pretend the LF lady is salaried OP's wife as a senior staff is being bamboozled.   
  
If it was a scamming LF lady that's just life. People on reddit, and anywhere, appreciate some sort of justice and fairness in life. There's bad seeds though, and there's a marked difference if it's a dude in the top or an opportunist volunteer."

Don't really think Al Jazeera is all that impartial either.   
  
  
The main thing to understand is that over the last few decades the region has been a shitshow of terrorist attacks and increasingly heavy handed government retaliation going back and forth. When having the military in to keep calm worked, the military was recalled citing the huge succes, and the shitheads blew up the local market less than a month after, CCP just cancelled Islam for the region. Now they're taking measures to prevent attacks in the future - and cultural genocide is depressingly efficient overall. Not many native tribes left in settled lands doing much rebelling these days. Denmark crushed Greenland, Europe collectively crushed all of America, Britain crushed Australia and New Zealand. Now genocide this day and age is pretty bloody abysmal, and something to condemn for sure, but it's not like we have a golden solution for terrorism to offer up. We're still fighting un-winnable wars trying to stabilise regions we either have financial or security interests in. Doesn't mean we shouldn't condemn China for the excessive measures. However, a modicum of introspection and awareness that we're being force-fed with propaganda is nice too, rather than just burning with media-guided rage thinking how uniquely horrid the Chinese government is :)"

>!It's essentially a visual thing of beauty with a plot that is pretty darn empty. Nothing much happens to a few storylines, to the backdrop of the overall event at Dunkirk. It's pretty and has great sound and all that. Very good for getting a sort of emotional glimpse at the battle, but that immersion is kind of broken by a timeline that artistically alludes to war being chaos.!<
