It was kinda funny the first time, but now it's just people putting the same idea into every format they can milk for karma.

Also people on the internet love to overreact to shit like ""World War III"" because nothing exciting happens in the sphere of their mundane lives."

If the government wanted everyone to have equal access to a digital currency, they would have to have the resources to give out over 400 million currency cards plus installing ATMs everywhere to deposit any cash that you may currently have."

However, for some reason we don't have those at all here in the U.S., so I had to go through a 2-minute process every time I paid to insert the card into the chip reader and follow the prompts.

The U.S. needs single-touch chip readers!"
