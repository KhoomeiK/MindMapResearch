I was slightly shocked as I’d never met a poly person, figured he was just super open to share this with me.

A few hours in some other people I knew show up and I introduced them to my new friend. Conversation meanders along and my friend mentions his girlfriend, singular. Not being my story to tell I naturally didn’t say anything, but felt weirdly honored that he shared that with me. Never spoken to him since.

acting,fc8vq94,t3_egr2cp,1577542785.0,"The only reason I’d use an existing scene for a reel is if it was absolutely the only footage I had and it was something I’d already done (student film, director sizzle reel, etc.). It would also be the first thing I dropped when I had any other options.

Two reasons: 1, no one is going to think it’s “real” footage from a professional project, so it doesn’t set you apart, in agent/casting eyes, from someone with nothing. 2, you’re not going for be able to escape the shadow of the original performance. We all loved the scene with Deniro and Pacino in Heat but you’re neither of those, and ever if you do a good job, it’s not going to be the “correct” one. 

Maybe, *maybe* you could get away with some obscure indie movie, but certainly don’t put in any effort to create this over something new. You need literal seconds of footage from a scene, it’s not hard to write something that hasn’t been done before by someone more famous that won’t be quite your type."
