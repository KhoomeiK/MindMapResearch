if they get $10/month for an average of 375 plays or 2.6c per play, i find it hard to believe they can't pay 1c per play and still eek out a profit with an incredibly simple business.. they don't create content like netflix, they have no physical logistics like amazon, they don't have 7 zillion products like google.. all they do is stream audio. 

think about neflix charges $1 more per month than spotify, and has to push MASSIVE bandwidth, 2GB/hr instead of 0.1GB/hr for spotify.

Then offer tuition credits, and interest free student loans to encourage people to go to university to study in fields where we are lacking workers and having to bring immigrants in. Raise the education and income level of Canadians we already have instead of letting the lower class/poverty class of uneducated Canadians get bigger while we bring in immigrants to get educated.

and hey if someone is stupid enough to think that it's horrific to let a baby take a lick of ice cream.. there's absolutely nothing i could ever say about any topic that would ever change their mind on it.. no matter how intelligently it was presented. i'm just here to mock them while i take a dump. i would never waste my time trying to change an idiots mind, that doesn't work. you'll realize that one day.."
canada,ff4tvla,t1_ff4sf07,1579572332.0,"hence why this story is national news... it's out of the ordinary and unacceptable. the article also gives you more examples of glaring issues with 911, where some people don't even have 911 and are instead forwarded to an operator, etc."
funny,ff4oq1b,t1_ff4ob9n,1579568772.0,"um, i gave my six month old a taste of ice cream.. almost everyone i know surely did the same, and we brushed their teeth twice a day, and didn't give them junk food more than a couple of times a month, and all our kids grew up to be just fine.

you're not trailer trash if you let your baby or toddler taste ice cream, you're trailer trash if you let your kid eat ice cream every day. you're confusing the two, and they're remarkably different.

do you have any ability to be reasonable and sensible or is everything all or nothing for you? no ability to even consider nuance or context?"
funny,ff4oew0,t1_ff4o1p9,1579568554.0,"i'm pretty happy with how i presented it. i think if people presented it like this more often, we'd have a lot less stupid shit being parroted. we're far too tolerant of stupidity"

I have a lot of downtime, life is pretty good, I'm just watching netflix right now.. my wife picked it, it's boring, but she's happy. So I'm shaking my head and laughing that kids these days think you should never let a child ever eat sugar EVER. It's like those parents who think that if their 2 year old even sees a tv for one minute, while visiting someone's house or something.. well it's all over, they're permanently fucked. Completely focusing on the wrong thing, teaching your child self control and discipline not sheltering from all temptation in life only to have them fall apart in adolescence because they were never taught how to cope or consume things in moderation.

I don't know where this modern mentality of ALL or nothing comes from, it's black or white, no one apparently has the ability to be reasonable or sensible anymore.. or maybe it's just these autistic reddit nerds who let's be fair, are probably never going to breed."

you guys are fucking retards. i've never used the word retard so much in my life but there truly is no other word to describe how stupid so many of you are. it's fucking crazy, you're all fucking crazy."
funny,ff4lczc,t1_ff4kuzl,1579566411.0,"someone got mad at me for using the word retard, but what else do you say to such a stupid comment? you're retarded. straight up. how the fuck does letting your kid have ice cream or a soft drink once a month get you to cavities, tooth extraction, jaw misplacement and diabetes. honestly? what the fuck is wrong with your brain? please don't breed."

i didn't put anyone at risk by following him, i followed the speed limit and obviously stayed in my lane.. i'm not sure why reddit thinks you have to drive like a maniac to follow one of these guys, they're not always speeding, just swerving."
