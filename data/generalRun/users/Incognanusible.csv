The Great Delusion: Liberal Dreams and International Realities was a talk given by Professor John J Mearsheimer at the Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy, SOAS University of London on 21 January 2019.  Find out more at http://bit.ly/2Dv5nlZ

It is widely believed in the West that the United States should spread liberal democracy across the world, foster an open international economy, and build institutions. This policy of remaking the world in America’s image is supposed to protect human rights, promote peace, and make the world safe for democracy. But this is not what has happened. Instead, the United States has ended up as a highly militarized state fighting wars that undermine peace, harm human rights, and threaten liberal values at home. Mearsheimer tells us why this has happened.

Speaker
John J. Mearsheimer is the R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago, where he has taught since 1982. He graduated from West Point in 1970 and then served five years as an officer in the U.S. Air Force. He then started graduate school in political science at Cornell University in 1975. He received his Ph.D. in 1980. He spent the 1979-1980 academic year as a research fellow at the Brookings Institution, and was a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard University's Center for International Affairs from 1980 to 1982. During the 1998-1999 academic year, he was the Whitney H. Shepardson Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.

Professor Mearsheimer has written extensively about security issues and international politics more generally. He has published six books: Conventional Deterrence (1983), which won the Edgar S. Furniss, Jr., Book Award; Liddell Hart and the Weight of History (1988); The Tragedy of Great Power Politics (2001, 2014), which won the Joseph Lepgold Book Prize and has been translated into eight different languages; The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy (with Stephen M. Walt, 2007), which made the New York Times best seller list and has been translated into twenty-two different languages; Why Leaders Lie: The Truth about Lying in International Politics (2011), which has been translated into ten different languages; and The Great Delusion: Liberal Dreams and International Realities (2018).

He has also written many articles that have appeared in academic journals like International Security, and popular magazines like Foreign Affairs and the London Review of Books. Furthermore, he has written a number of op-ed pieces for the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times dealing with topics like Bosnia, nuclear proliferation, American policy towards India, the failure of Arab-Israeli peace efforts, the folly of invading Iraq, and the causes of the Ukrainian crisis.

Finally, Professor Mearsheimer has won a number of teaching awards. He received the Clark Award for Distinguished Teaching when he was a graduate student at Cornell in 1977, and he won the Quantrell Award for Distinguished Teaching at the University of Chicago in 1985. In addition, he was selected as a Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar for the 1993-1994 academic year. In that capacity, he gave a series of talks at eight colleges and universities. In 2003, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Thanks for the link. These look like defensive measures to me however I don't think SA has to worry about a ground attack by Iran anytime soon for the same reason Iran doesn't need to really worry about a ground attack by US and allies anytime soon. The mountains that protect them also make it nearly impossible for them to really launch an effective ground attack.

>President Barack Obama had to reverse his pledge in 2015 to bring all American troops, bar a handful, home from Afghanistan. There are 14,000 of them there to this day.

I truly believe the US wants out of there as soon as possible. SA is a safer place for their troops and resources to be."

This is PR to me. This is just something to get their base and others that want this to happen on their side.

> Trump has shown exactly zero inclination to be a strategic thinker

You realize that the US gov is way bigger then the president and his administration right?

I think you're making this more about them then what's in the US's long-term strategic interests.

>Also trump has sent a division and a half to the region after signing himself up to be the Saudi guarantor.

This gives extra cover to pack up and leave in my eyes. Also, the administration stood by when SA was just attacked by Iran that [halved](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/saudi-oil-attacks-latest-updates-190916102800973.html) their oil production.

>trump foreign policy

US foreign policy. Trump is the tip of a huge pyramid."
CanadaPolitics,fdagegb,t1_fdabp82,1578245770.0,"The US is making moves as China rises. They want to slow, stop or reverse Chinese growth to maintain their power advantage and the best way to do it is to make them pay for all the protection that previously the US was giving them and the world to allow free trade to happen.

Most likely for normal people this means the cost of everything is going to go up as businesses and industry adjust/move to the changing world. We probably won't see jobs coming back here anytime soon.The businesses that're in China will move probably to India and other poorer nations.

The strike accomplished many things for the US.

It makes Iran very weary about sending high level officials out of the country for diplomacy or even for extra-curricular activities  if they know the US could strike them down at any time.

It takes heat off President Trump's impeachment which might help  him get re-elected and even if he doesn't it means the Dems will inherit whatever results from this and then the Repubs get to make them look bad.

I don't think the administration came up with the move. The US gov is a massive entity and the party in charge is merely the head of a Goliath.

We're witnessing the game board being reshuffled as we move to a multi-polared hegemonic power world."
CanadaPolitics,fdaa8tw,t3_ekevk1,1578243583.0,"This is probably something the US intended with the strike.

Strategically the US has no reason to be in the region anymore as the shale/oil revolution has given the US an out and energy independence. I feel like they're trying to leave the area and let others deal with the situation. China will most likely pick up the torch to carry in this region in the future as the growing hegemonic power needs the oil in order to continue to grow and it's going to be very costly for them which is great for the US. The powers in the region: Turkey, SA and Iran will bare the brunt of the chaos that's been created and left behind."
CanadaPolitics,fd9j5ms,t1_fd375q0,1578234126.0,"> The United States have the military capability to mop Iran by themselves.

Sorry but you don't know a thing about actual combat. The territory is mountainous, sparse, vast and the people who live there have a civilization going back thousands of years. They know the territories strength and weaknesses.

Any boots on the ground would get slaughtered above and beyond what happened in Vietnam plus in comparison Iran's population is twice that of the Vietnamese at the time.

The US can't bomb the civilians without it becoming a PR nightmare and you'd best know that Iran will turn this into a PR nightmare that'll create huge anti-war demonstrations across the US and the world as every dead and dismembered child will be broadcast around the world for everyone to see. Not too mention that bombing civilians is a war crime and the world will turn against them, especially the Iranian people."
