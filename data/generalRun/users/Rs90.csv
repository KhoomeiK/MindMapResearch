rva,ffgqxu0,t1_ffgpflh,1579912799.0,"Isn't that all the more reason to lend a hand? Yes, there are shitty parents in this world. But don't take it out on the children. By your logic they're already suffering. And your decision is to what? Let em burn?"
rva,ffgn9zi,t1_ffgliby,1579910207.0,"You're being ridiculed because you're making a lot of assumptions and it makes you sound like a damn psychopath. Pregnancies happen, sometimes planned and sometimes not. Some aren't taught about contraceptives or are misinformed about how they work. Some have a child and then hit hard times. Like rent skyrocketing and wage stagnation.

Stop being pissed at people having sex. People will NEVER stop having sex. Wanna be pissed? Be pissed at conservatives that wanna cut social programs, access to birth control, and teach abstinence only sexual education. You're entire outlook is cruel, ignorant, and downright fucked up. And that's coming from a misanthrope like me.

Edit-and this is leaving out things like rape or birth control not always working."
BattlefieldV,fffqsne,t3_etc02h,1579889785.0,"Yep, I uninstalled a couple months ago cause I wasn't feelin it. Wanted to see how things played out. Downloading BF4 now on PS4 cause there's a couple sick harcore servers still around. Hmu if ya wanna play! 

Sad to say I genuinely am not interested in the next Battlefield. WWII Battlefield practically prints money and they somehow fucked it up. My biggest fear is just how long it'll take to try another WWII Battlefield, if they even try again. Sucks. RIP Battlefield."
rva,fffkm0u,t1_fffjlw2,1579885995.0,"Yeah, they definitely trip me out sometimes when I'm tryna cross the street. Like lookin at your watch 3 or 4 times and still not knowing the time. But as a local I kinda do that with Broad St no matter what. Hate that whole road lol."

PS4,ffd6lrw,t1_ffd18f4,1579814427.0,"I meant besides that lol. More ruins to explore, secrets to find. I dunno. Just want a little more to do I guess. Like I hope cities have more in them next time."
BattlefieldV,ffd2bia,t1_ffchntq,1579812024.0,Same. PS4 has some great hardcore servers still!
PS4,ffcwgpt,t1_ffcvufe,1579808705.0,Yeah I just had to not get them otherwise I'd use em by reflex. I ended up doing a lot to nerf myself ingame. Like turning HUD options off and not using the weapon augment things.
PS4,ffcw8bl,t3_esxrrp,1579808563.0,First I've heard of this. Looks a bit too..floaty? Like there's no weight to anything. And way too much happening on screen lol. But maybe I'm just drawing too many comparisons to Titanfall 2.
PS4,ffcvn8i,t3_esvquj,1579808208.0,Hope they put more secrets and things to find in the wastes next time. Game world is beautiful but a bit emptier than hoped. I don't need collectables but...needed somethin.
PS4,ffcvgiv,t1_ffcu112,1579808094.0,I really hope they tweak this stuff if they make a sequel. You become god-like way too easily imo. I found myself nerfing certain things to maintain immersion. I never get the critical hit skills and so on. One shotting enemies felt fucking awful.
PS4,ffcv7ku,t1_ffcn46g,1579807944.0,"Highly recommend fiddling in the options and map options specifically. Turning off certain things like the monster location thing. Basically tells you what enemies are in the area the moment you enter it. Imo this took away a lot of the surprise, knowing what you expect to encounter. 

Can also turn off camp locations because there's a million and I find I stared at the compass way too much. Limiting all this junk made me focus on the game WAY more and made everything far more exciting imo. Worth a looksy."
worldnews,ffcm8r5,t1_ffcllkj,1579802441.0,"That some kinda Virginia farmer joke!? Jk, I'm just getting fed up is all. They're using classic bully tactics. Bullies only respond to one thing, and it ain't taking the high road in my experience. They're banking solely on our reliance of good faith and honorable intent. We're being taken for a ride, hard."
worldnews,ffclf8v,t1_ffcl995,1579801952.0,We gonna have this debate again? lol
worldnews,ffck8lg,t1_ffcj4hx,1579801233.0,"The high road is littered with the corpses of honest people. That's the GOP's entire fucking foundation. That ""good people"" won't play their game. It's why they have so much power. This nation will never more forward imo until we stop convincing ourselves that anything beyond the most honorable route makes us the monsters we fight. It's the oldest tactic in the book, man. Convince the good their too good to do anything about it. At what point do we just suck it up and stoop to their level to actually get shit done? These people should be in prison and we're all just shaking our heads like ""have they no shame?"". NO! The answer is fucking no, they don't."
worldnews,ffchatc,t1_ffc5n9c,1579799449.0,"I mean....overhauling any system is going to affect the economy. To combat climate change we'd pretty much need to install some VERY heavy utilitarian regulations. A full crackdown on the overconsumption of non-essentials and even some very essential goods. So yeah, they're pretty intertwined. That's the entire point of all this. Our economical system is devastating the climate. Economics matters wether you like it or not. And we're talking global economy. One nation isn't gonna do it.

Edit- I should really look up definitions before running my mouth tho. Perhaps I'm conflating things incorrectly."
