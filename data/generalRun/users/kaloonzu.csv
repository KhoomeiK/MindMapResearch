What many people don't know, is that Henry Ford was, at best, a Nazi sympathizer, and at worst, a Nazi himself. He personally funded Father Coughlin and his *Social Justice* magazine, which was virulently anti-Semitic and pro-fascist. He also allowed Ford's German division to not only continue manufacture during the war (until the US joined in), he tacitly permitted them to build military equipment, including the turbines for the V1 and V2 rockets that were being used against Britain. He also took no opposition to the use of slave labor from the concentration and death camps in the factories over there.
