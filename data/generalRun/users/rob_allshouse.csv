todayilearned,fd0crw0,t1_fd0cnuj,1578116984.0,Nah. It was just a random one from the shitton of notifications that came in.
todayilearned,fd09xfs,t1_fd091dr,1578115804.0,"There’s one defining characteristic, at least to this community, that does separate them in many ways from the examples you use, and that’s communication. They speak a different language than the rest. That does mean they’re better or worse, just different and somewhat isolated as a community. And thus, the insular nature of that has led to its own set of norms, behaviors, and oneness. 

You mention other groups, that has happened there, too, but not via linguistics, but persecution. If the only place you could be yourself was tied into your community, such as LGBTQ folk up until about a decade ago, it insulated you. You hit some good points, in some ways losing the insular nature of that community via a strong reduction in discrimination has helped it just flow into the rest of society, and been overall a good thing. Screw the identity and labels, and just be part of the whole. That only works when society writ large is okay with that. 

For Deaf individuals though, the language becomes a severe barrier to that."
todayilearned,fd04j8w,t1_fd03t85,1578113516.0,So not defensive. Just an ass with too much time on their hands? Got it.
todayilearned,fczwmow,t1_fczw00x,1578109875.0,"Well, I don’t know the technical definition of what defines a distinct culture. I’d say, though, that having their own language is a pretty significant indicator. You can be deaf and not Deaf; the capital indicates, not just hearing disability, but also a part of the Deaf culture and community.

todayilearned,fczv9q8,t1_fczutaz,1578109205.0,"You’re right and wrong, and come across a bit defensive. 

When used as an adjective to describe the inability to hear, it’s lower case. When referring to the group of individuals within the Deaf culture, then yes, it’s absolutely appropriate to capitalize it, just like you do any proper reference of any culture."
todayilearned,fczr07m,t1_fczpv27,1578107131.0,"Sure... uh...

Or do I detect sarcasm with the .. uh.. yet a lack of the more blatant /s to indicate as such?"
todayilearned,fczoo9g,t1_fczn85n,1578105815.0,"This references peer reviewed articles. My wife actually worked at and with the DCAL labs at Gallaudet, UCL, RIT, and UC Davis on this type of research. Her Master is from UCL on neuroscience and language acquisition in Deaf individuals.
