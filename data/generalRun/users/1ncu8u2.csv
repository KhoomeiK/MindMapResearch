bose,fcl1289,t3_ehiwyt,1577737499.0,"they are soft, but you will likely feel them under your neck. the base of the cups touch together under my jaw, so it restricts looking downward too far. looking more than 45 degrees off-center (i.e. side-to-side) you will feel the cup touch your jugular. looking up is comfortable, but prob won't be doing that as much lol

since reading your question I've tried this flipping the cups up (the only way they can turn when worn forward -- someone else suggested you could wear them backwards to rest on your shoulders). the headband closes a little closer to your neck, but you get more range downward & side-to-side"
