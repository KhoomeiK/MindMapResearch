I have an 8:30 curfew when I'm out with friends, I have to be in bed by 10:30, up by 8, even if I have nothing to do, and I have to ask before I go anywhere. It's cost me several good guys because they're immediately turned off by my living situation. The best part is, I'm pregnant and a liability, so nobody will hire me and I'm stuck here. They take advantage of this by threatening to kick me out if I disobey any of their rules or get too mouthy."

AskReddit,fc43g46,t3_efyrzj,1577405627.0,"Two sisters are sitting on their front porch in Georgia. One of them is 18, and just got back from the city where her father sent her to get cultured. She's telling her younger sister about all the different kinds of people she saw. 

""They got women down there that like women!"" She explains. Her sister clutches at her chest in shock. 

""Oh my stars, what do they call them?"" Her sister asks in shock. 

""They call them lesbians. That's not all, got men down there that like men!"" She exclaims.

""Oh my lands, well I never! What do they call them?"" Her sister asks, aghast. 

""They call them gays. That's not the end of it, neither! They got men down there that like women's privates."" She whispers. 

""Oh, well, oh my!"" Her sister gasps, her cheeks flushing red. ""What do they call them?""

She sits and thinks for a minute before finally answering, ""well, I don't rightly know, but when he come up for air, I called him precious."""

AskReddit,fbr5250,t3_ee3b1i,1577039244.0,"I made a friend and we both expressed a little more interest in each other after spending a lot of time together. One night, he ended up at a party with his ex and realized he still wasn't over her, and decided to isolate completely. I'm so worried about him, and I really hope he's okay, but I dont want to message him and potentially confuse him more. Thus, I've been silent about how much this is affecting me, and how hurt I feel even though I know it's selfish to feel that way.
I really needed this, thank you so much."
