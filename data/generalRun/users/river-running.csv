AmItheAsshole,fdh4uig,t3_eldsts,1578415412.0,"YTA, slightly. You're not wrong in that caring for a newborn doesn't constitute exercise. But this is a bad time to be asking someone about their workout habits. With a baby that's less than two weeks old, she probably hasn't been able to or concerned about dedicated exercise for at least a month or two. Maybe she had a complicated pregnancy and couldn't exercise for some or all of it. And now that the baby's here and she's recovering, it's not going to be a priority for some time yet.

I think a better way to phrase that question, if you need to ask it at all, would be ""what were your workout habits like before or during the pregnancy and what do you imagine that they will be like once you are able to resume regular exercise?"" Then, if she still insists that caring for the child is exercise, just drop it. Recently postpartum women are in a weird place mentally, and it's not worth the fight."
