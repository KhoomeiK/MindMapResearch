And I'd tell her chin up, body positivity eventually becomes mainstream and you'll realize a lot of the things stressing you out right now won't matter at all in the big picture."
AzerothPorn,ff6t0ta,t1_ff6pouh,1579634276.0,"It's funny that although the vanilla stuff is certainly more popular with most people the ""fringe"" stuff will always be here because a lot of things are possible with art that just aren't possible in ""real"" porn.

Even calling it ""normie"" is... a bit off. I mean being cishet makes it a bit mundane for some people but I'm here because I've spent so many years playing this game I have enjoyed playing and even dabbling in roleplaying most of the different races and at some point if you are realistically fleshing out a character they're going to think about sex. And sex in a universe where the different races are more different than just different shades of the same species is interesting to me. The lore of warcraft has more drama and dynamics than any modern soap opera. So when it comes to elves, they may be pretty and vanilla but they're still a magical fantasy race. They've got other things going on to make sex and relationships different from the way humans experience them, like immortality and magic. It's not like I'm gonna get that fantasy itch scratched by watching real porn even if elves are essentially just fit humans with pointy ears."

brakebills,fenrnq6,t1_felnbf2,1579289754.0,I went in with low expectations and I loved it. We'll see how the rest of the story unfolds. I love love love Jason Ralph and no discredit to his portrayal of Quentin but I'm not sure his story was ever my favorite anyway? It definitely didn't carry the other characters/actors. They are all strong.

Really that covers all shamanic races that live in contact with wolves. 

HOWEVER, on that note, I don't recall any wolves in voldun so I'm not sure what spirit animal they would pick."
