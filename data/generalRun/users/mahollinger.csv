moderatepolitics,ff55brz,t1_ff4w42e,1579580660.0,"That same information is sold by your utility companies, phone and internet services, credit bureaus, etc. The information is also only what I put up, so if I am not liking, subscribing, etc. the data is only partial. I’m also not posting every place I go or what I am always doing like some people. I prefer an as private life as I choose on social media. I think a more reasonable approach for most people is to limit their usage and be more aware of their activity and how it may or may not affect them.

Change the culture surrounding social media is easier than removing it completely as there will most always be more people joining than leaving."
moderatepolitics,ff4rwsm,t1_ff4rcqx,1579570975.0,">If you have a FB/IG/Twitter account, then you are part of the problem.

But not Reddit?? (Which I find has the best and worst of participants)

I don’t think by just having those accounts, you’re part of the problem, especially a good chunk of IG users. I have a Twitter but never use it except for free shit in apps. I barely post on my IG except with industry and hobby related pictures - never politics. And my FB is used mostly for networking with industry professionals and sharing pictures with family. Occasionally political stuff is posted but I have learned to not engage anymore with others’ nonsense because, frankly, it’s not worth it. If I want to engage in politics, it’s usually in-person or in the phone.

I’m not disagreeing that social media is a problem but it’s how people have become accustomed to using it and how corporations and politicians have then used that weakness to exploit division and unrest. But there are also plenty of individuals that use them that aren’t up-in-arms on every false narrative clickbait article that comes prancing by."

FFRecordKeeper,fdrkz9e,t1_fdq6xbr,1578685997.0,Probably. I just tried it the one time to see the fight and noticed the AoE was demonstrative. Haven’t seriously worked through a proper team to combat the healing needed yet.
FFRecordKeeper,fdrkuqf,t1_fdpntyk,1578685918.0,"Thanks for all of the advice. I had enough and picked up Ignis’ BSB. The team I put together as suggested (using Edward’s USB Faithga) wasn’t strong enough yet for Madden as I do need some more magicite work done from 4* Holy/Dark. That said, the team was able to do sub-30 Siren with Enkidu to clear the first silence and then demolish her with Ultemicia.  This will help me get Hades down with more ease so I can build those Magicite up as well. With some farming, I could probably get Madeen down within a week of steady playing.

Did some of the realm banners, got a couple USBs but nothing I substantially need at the moment, or at least not seeing immediate use yet.

Edit: Also made an R4 Necro Countdown, although R3 would probably have sufficed, to do more damage than Dark Zone."
