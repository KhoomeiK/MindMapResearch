I thought she just needed space on the couch so I moved over. Later on after I got up or whatever and like we took a break or something, we go back, I sit back down, and she sits on my lap again. I moved again thinking the same thing had happened like she needed space. She kept trying to talk to me, pointed to a drawing of a dick on the wall, I thought she was talking about something else. I had no fucking idea. ..... I was socially awkward etc. I wanna kick my self but I was so innocent. I've been called the cutest guy out of the group amongst other friends and such.

That's why I trust them and give them the opportunity to be more or grow. There are particular things in life you can grow from without having to have the experience. Life works in a very set way, it's not hard to understand it, but it's not fluid. That's why its attainable. It also takes looking at the source. I literally stayed a monk for 26 years. As well, I'm pretty intimidating, no one really comes to me first so it was a breath of fresh air. We have the exact same birthday. Same previous employment aspirations, both been through abuse, both dealt w supernatural. I dunno, I wanted to give it a chance.

The girl is in this sub, that's why I made the post, but the girl has an ex who died who she thinks is haunting her. Either shes a sweet chick and read my submissions, or her haunting ex warned her something. The other conclusion could be that we have the exact same birthday and she does astrology stuff, may be she looked at the compatibility stuff, saw my habits on my profile and ghosted me.

It's not consistent. That's what I have issue with. If it was more predictable, would be different. I mean back before they changed the mapping and still had the old payment system, it was more reliable. You could guess how much you were gonna make based on the hours put in. They changed the mapping to where it only equated to 10$ per hour, then the new pay models so now everything is up in the air. With the new mapping, if your zone is out of business like it's slow in one part of town, you cant go to another side of town where business is still going.
