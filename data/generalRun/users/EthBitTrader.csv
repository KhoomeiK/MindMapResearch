WTF,ffiq5an,t1_ffipejo,1579979942.0,"Update:  Hello All! I want to thank the St James Hospital in Dublin, Ireland, for getting my finger back in the correct direction, this morning...My playing life flashed before me this morning as I had a stupid fall and ended up on my back ,with my finger dislocated sideways! Cut a long story short, I was worried that I'd broken it! Ambulance came and took me to emergency... Thank heavens the X-ray showed no breaks or tears...so they gave a jab..ouch! then pulled it and it popped back into place...I just tried playing tonight,, I can!!Hooray... !!! its going to be alright! phew! xx TE ..PS...Happy Birthday Django..."
WTF,ffipejo,t3_etrch1,1579979419.0," I met Tommy Emmanuel a few years ago. He took my hand without hesitation. ""It is such a pleasure to meet you Mr. Emmanuel"". He laughed, ""It's Tommy"". While talking to him I asked him if he favours certain fingers while playing, he guaffed "" I wish I had more""

Tommy's dad, a former coal miner, took the clan on the road when Tommy was just 6. He did so after the family band was a hit on an Australian television show.

They bought two cars, which they slept in. Often, they'd make only enough for a dinner of rice and powdered milk. 

 Tommy is one of those rare gifts that lull the senses into that everything is alright in the world even while war rages on. Have a fussy baby that won't sleep ? Put on some TE."

DidntKnowIWantedThat,fc4vfrf,t1_fc4u76z,1577430019.0,"I'd like to add a couple of points. 

&#x200B;

* One person said "" Everything that goes down your drain goes to a waste water treatment plant.""

The UN, in 2017 said ""  In all but the most highly developed countries, the vast majority of wastewater is released directly to the environment without adequate treatment, with detrimental impacts on human health, economic productivity, the quality of ambient freshwater resources, and ecosystems.""

&#x200B;

* Another person said "" Currently, I'm studying Environmental Engineering as a graduate student. We specialize in wastewater and water treatment design. Removing these substance from the water is usually done through physical, chemical or biological process. 

What about antibacterial soaps ? If youre lucky enough to have a treatment plant wouldnt that kill the microbes that are supposed to be digesting your poop ?

I just cant help but thinking of truckload after truckload leaving the factories for the last 70 years.
