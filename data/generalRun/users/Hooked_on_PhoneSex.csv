I'm torn here. I understand your point, and your wife's argument.

I assume that your wife is the primary caregiver and/or a primarily a stay at home mom. As such, blogging may be her primary way of communicating with adults throughout the day. In essence, her blog is potentially a coping mechanism. Forcing her to shut it down without finding a better solution first seems a little harsh.

Making private and personal details about your family public without the informed consent of all parties is unacceptable. It should have been stopped far before it got this out of hand.

You and your wife need to talk about this at length. If at all possible, your wife should change names and details in old blog posts to better protect your family's privacy. You two also need to set ground rules regarding appropriate subject matter.

Finally, as an adult with autism, I can assure you, that I would have been incredibly hurt if I found out that my parents had publicized the challenges of my childhood. I already have difficulty trusting people, and I would view this as a fairly egregious betrayal. I can't speak to your children, but consider the effect that your wife's blog may have on her adult relationship with them.

If it's possible, consider family counseling. Preferably someone who specializes in helping families coping with autism. Your wife needs better coping mechanisms, and you two need to get on the same page regarding responsibilities and decision making with regard to your kids."

When animals ""drown"", they die of suffocation, because they are unable to extract enough oxygen through their lungs when filled with fluid. Since sharks use gills to extract oxygen, they can continue to breathe as long as water is able to pass across their gills. Some sharks do this mechanically, while others rely on water current to push water past their gills. As long as a shark is able to successfully exchange gas (O2 and Co2), it will not suffocate. Therefore, a shark would drown in any amount of water that is insufficient in volume to pass through the shark's gills, or if the shark is unable to move water due to lack of water flow, or inhibition of the shark's ability to mechanically pump water through their gills.

If the students were simply asked to give a review, then there's nothing untoward going on. Statistically speaking, people who are asked to give a review for an employer or business, are more likely to leave good or neutral reviews. The ones who would give poor reviews are discouraged from leaving any review at all. This happens due to apathy, sometimes due to fear that the employer/business would be able to identify the negative review, etc. By requesting reviews, the business engages in a calculated gamble, knowing that the number of positive /neutral reviews would diminish the influence of bad ones.

If the business or school offers an incentive to write positive reviews, hires people who are not current or former clients, provide scripted review language, or reserve the right to edit or veto a review, then they are engaging in fraud.

Did your parents indicate that they have a problem with your being gay?

Did they say anything hurtful about you kissing a boy?

Parents can react poorly when their kids come out. They may say hurtful things initially. They may also have voiced negative opinions about homosexuality in the past. But when they find out that their own child is gay, they come around.

Your decision to stop talking to your parents might be premature. If you just fear an uncomfortable or embarrassing conversation with your parents, then definitely talk to them anyway. Maybe your uncle is willing to help you with that conversation?

If on the other hand, you worry about your safety, fear a violent reaction from your parents, or think that they may kick you out of your home, then you will need to take steps to protect yourself. There are resources for gay teens available in many countries. These include housing assistance if family cast you out. They also offer help with health care, support and mental health resources. I strongly urge you to reach out to some of these resources if you fear your parents' reactions. 

Consider finding out more about local queer alliances and support groups even if your parents react well. It helps to find people to talk to, who've gone through the same things you have."
atheism,ff3xwwg,t3_er4m2i,1579551261.0,"Your dorm should have a TA if this is on-campus housing. Part of the TA's duties is to help mediate situations like this. See if your roommate is willing to go through TA mediation to set up some house rules.

Your roommate is not being reasonable if she expects you to vacate your room or stop your normal activities during prayer sessions. She is also being unreasonable in jamming a prayer group into your small dorm room. There are typically prayer rooms, mosques, meditation spaces, interfaith churches, or other common rooms available on campus, which are designed to allow students to pray undisturbed. This is where your roommate needs to go if she wants to host frequent group sessions, or expects you to leave/be quiet during her prayers.

If your roommate is unwilling to compromise or continues to monopolize your shared living quarters, your TA can help move you to another room free of charge.

On a side note, I had a college roommate who would have loud prayer gatherings in the common dorm spaces. These gatherings included men, even though it was a women's dorm. She would set up in the living room for hours, let her guests make a mess, and they would loudly sing gospels, practice stomp dance routines, and just generally make themselves obnoxious. I finally had enough and turned on some of the loudest, angriest death metal I could find. They were gone before the song ended, and never had another session. I'm not advocating for the asshole routine, but you can reclaim your right to your shared space by doing the exact same things she is doing. Planning to hold group prayers at three? Invite some classmates to study with you during the same timeframe. Creeped out by being prayed at? Turn on the lights and stare at her the whole time.

You are entitled to a safe, quiet living environment. While reasonable compromise is appropriate, you cannot, and should never be made to feel unwelcome in your own living space. See if your roommate sees reason first. Try to find a passable solution, or move. If all else fails, and you aren't willing to give up, be a dick about it as a last resort.

Give your GF a day or so to cool off, then have a calm conversation with her. Tell her exactly what you said, and apologize to her  (I don't actually think you owe her an apology, but it might be easier to smoothe things over if you do). Tell her you didn't intend to hurt her feelings, and slept like that because you had no other choices.

If you are in a healthy relationship (and didn't not any pertinent acts of past indiscretion), then your GF will recognize that you A) had no choice, B) had no untoward intentions, and C) shouldn't have been attacked about something this stupid, right after the trauma of being excommunicated by your family.

However, your GF sounds like she might be a bit immature, and at least has some (hopefully undeserved) trust issues. She also is creating extra stress and drama during a time when she should've been nothing but helpful and supportive. I hope that this is a one time occurrence, but you should measure your GF's reaction and consider it a red flag.

I am a voracious carnivore, and I would never have been offended by a vegetarian dinner.

I kind of understand why your mom said it was hypocritical. People tend to have a somewhat negative opinion of vegans and vegetarians who get unreasonably outraged that ill informed hosts don't offer vegan/vegetarian entre options, and assume that their guest would be fine on sides and salads. However, your situation is NOTHING like that. You thoughtfully prepared a complete meal. You don't eat meat and probably aren't the best at preparing meat dishes. It's not unreasonable to cook what you know.

 Generally, when throwing a dinner party, it's customary for the host to ask if there are any dietary restriction or preferences. I'm guessing that you didn't do this, and likely also didn't remind your guests that the meal would not include a meat option. Next time you have a party, consider telling your guests that you have a vegetarian household, and either prepare an optional meat based entré, or, if you don't feel comfortable, suggest that guests bring a meat based dish, if they aren't ok with a plant only meal.

In either event, guests who voiced irritation over a meatless dinner were a bit rude, and those who whined to your mom are just all out shitty."
news,feyl7on,t1_fex4dl6,1579447073.0,"I was viciously bullied for two years, while riding the school bus. I came home in tears every single day, and begged my parents but to make me go back. They made me ride that 1 hour and 20 minutes bus ride every day for 2 years. First they told me to fight back (it was seven kids, and my school had a zero tolerance fighting policy.) I fought back a couple of times, earned myself a suspension, and was grounded by my parents. After that, I didn't fight back. Couldn't risk an expulsion, and didn't want to be punished at home on top of it. My parents reached out to school counselors a couple of times. They suggested that the kids were picking on me because they liked me and didn't know how to show it. ""Boys will be boys"" basically.

Nobody did a thing to help me after that. My parents drove me to school, but left me to ride the bus home every day. I was so stressed about that daily nightmare bus ride, that my grades suffered, and I was constantly faking being sick, to avoid having to deal with that ride. 

One of the boys who bullied me started following me home every day, so I wasn't even safe in my own yard, until I locked the door behind me.

One day, my little brother left his aluminum bat outside. That little piece of shit who liked to follow me home was hot on my heels like usual, but I saw that bat, and finally decided that I'd had enough. Even after that, the bullying didn't stop entirely, but it definitely wasn't as bad anymore.

If I had children (never gonna happen), and this kind of shit was happening to one of mine, I'd pursue immediate criminal actions. That little girl was being assaulted. Yes the little monsters who were doing it were children as well, but I honestly don't give a shit. Children who commit crimes are still criminals. One arrest or criminal charge would likely get most of these little assholes back in line, or at least force their parents to manage their progeny.

Children cannot be given a free pass to asault and harass their peers, and if schools and parents fail to adequately protect victims of bullying, then those kids need and deserve the full protection of the criminal Justice system."

AskReddit,femrqlo,t3_epzl8d,1579267715.0,"Although we have other political parties, our system is set up in such a way, that only the Republican and Democratic party have any hope of electing a candidate. As a result, Representatives from those parties tend to focus primarily on the central issues important to their voting base, and pander to the fringe issues championed by the least centrist voters. Issues concerning smaller groups (of the opposing party), tend to receive zero attention.

Trouble is, that we all have interests, that conflict with the platform of our chosen political party. In theory, one would be able to select a political party that specifically represents the principles that most matter to individual voters, but if we did that, we would be throwing away our vote, since that party has no hope of winning an election.

Similarly, our national elections virtually guarantee that the interests and needs of the majority of the country get ignored. 

For example, if a Republican President is in office, and the house and Senate both have Republican super-majorities, then policy decisions will favor the interests of Republican electorates, to the detriment of Democratic ideologies.

If a Republican President is elected, but there are Democratic super-majorities in the House and Senate, it is probable that policy decisions will favor the interests of Democrates to the detriment of Republicans.

If neither the House or Senate has a super-majority, then policy decisions will favor the party of the sitting President. That President may choose to marginalize the minority party, or choose to collaborate with both parties to push through policies with bipartisan support. Since it is easier to marginalize the opposing party, that minority party has no choice but to interfere with or delay policy decisions, to prevent policy changes too heavily skewed towards the needs/preferences of the majority party.

As a result, this adversarial system has essentially split the country into two competing factions. People aligned with the opposing party are often ridiculed or harassed, and Republicans and Democrates are increasingly hostile towards eachother. Rather than compromising for the good of the country, politicians stick to (sometimes outlandish) fringe ideologies, to please the most fickle part of their voting base. Politicians also come up with methods to marginalize certain groups, so as to guarantee that future elections favor their own party (I.e. gerrymandering, redistricting, last minute voter purging, etc.)

Our system needs a lot of work, but it is unlikely that any sweeping changes will happen anytime soon. Although our country is deeply divided along party lines, our system has managed to keep this country going for nearly 300 years, and the process is more or less stable."

Does she think being bisexual is about indecision, unwillingness to come out as either gay or straight? Or does she not believe in homosexuality at all?

While the term originally referred to slaves and their descendents, who have familial origins in Africa, the term is now primarily used as a more PC reference for skin color.

That being said, you are whatever you identify as. If you identify as African due to your mother's heritage, but also I dentify as American, then you'd be African American or Multiracial. If you'd rather identify more with your mother's heritage, then you'd classify yourself as African, or whatever country your mother is from (I.e. Somali, Egyptian, etc.)

I don't know if the way you are answering indicates that you've done more and don't want to admit it, or if you just aren't aware. This girl is responding like a person who is supremely uncomfortable interacting with you.

If you came across as a more rational individual, then I would assume that Ex BF's threats are just boneheaded wannabe cop comments. However, in light of the other comments you've left, I am going to assume that he has legitimate concerns about your behavior.

Your actions are not rational or healthy. You were needy and drove away a friend. You need to accept this and move on with your life. Leave this girl alone. If she ever wants to talk to you again, SHE will initiate that conversation.

Hopefully you can learn from this experience, and won't ruined any other friendships.

I don't believe, I know. The lifecycle is a readily observable phenomenon. Through centuries of direct observation and scientific study, we know what happens to the human body after we die.

I assume that you also want to know what we think about the afterlife. In the absence of evidence that either exists, I am unable to believe in either, and therefore unable to concern myself with what would happen after we die."
