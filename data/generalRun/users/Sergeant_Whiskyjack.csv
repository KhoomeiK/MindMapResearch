The period that is my current present was meant to be a time of relative peace in my post-apocalyptic Europe. 

The decade long Slaver War was finally over with the last slaver state capitulating and agreeing to outlaw slavery. 

It was only a few months later that the rumour spread across Asia Minor that the so-called Holy Horde, a million strong cannibalistic and apocalyptic cult had left the Middle East and was marching for Istanbul.

The major western powers of the New Hanseatic League, the Coalition and the Vatican weren't exactly on best terms with the Islamic caliphate that rulled the city and nearby lands but there has never been any true hostilities and there was no doubt that if the Horde destroyed Istanbul it would then be free to strike at the heart of Europe.

And so a huge cross-continental defence force was mustered. Many soldiers who were still returning home after Slaver War were given new orders and redirected towards Turkey. Many more volunteers were added the the ranks. The Vatican marketed the coming conflict as a holy war, which drummed up tribalistic fever to a point where young people were eager to do their part.

The majority of the defence force got to the city before the Horde. One of my main characters, Tosh led a regiment of his Rangers from the distant Scottish Highlands with his wife Rachel serving as his XO.

They watched the Horde approach from the scrap metal walls of Istanbul.

Only... it wasn't the whole Horde, but just one third. The other two headed straight for the Bosporus Straight and commandeered as many boats as they could.

Those in the city didn't realise they weren't facing the whole Horde until after the hard wrought battle which lasted two days and nights was won. Jubilation turned into dispair. By the time they got to the straight the rest of the Horde would be over it. And anyways they weren't in any condition to take on more than 600,000 savages in a standing battle.

Long story short (as this is getting long as it is) the defence force has to wait for reinforcements to be shipped in. By this time the Horde has made it further west, razing every village, town and city it comes across. Tosh is leading a division who have been tasked with biting at the Horde's heels to try and slow it so the main force can get around it and put itself between the Horde and Budapest."

The only monsters in my world are other humans in a lawless world.

But the Rangers fit the question nevertheless.

The guild was started when after a decade of travelling post apocalyptic Europe a group of ex-caravan guards returned to their remote homeland to find it still infested with slavers, raiders and violent clans. They had left as teenagers as guard apprentices to escape that exact violence and anarchy.

They decide to put their skills and equipment to good use and patrol a single trade route between two villages. Their success is almost immediately apparent to the locals and they soon find themselves with a small army of young (and a few old) volunteers needing put to work.

So they are able to protect more roads leading to more settlements. Which increases their volunteer pool.

To begin with the Rangers (which was originally just a placeholder name for the organisation but no one came up with anything better) relied on handouts from appreciative civilians for food and clothes. Their weapons and equipment for that first army of volunteers was provided by a couple of powerful allies who approved of the Rangers' mission.

But it goes further than that. The US military provides cheap housing for its employees, it provides them with universal healthcare and pays for a lot (most?) of their higher education.

I'm not disparaging this. Just pointing out that the US government and many on the right are happy to engage in this form of socialism.

Even the most ardent capitalist wouldn't advocate letting the market run the military. Here in the UK after WW2 it was decided that national health was too important to let it be a profit driven exercise."
