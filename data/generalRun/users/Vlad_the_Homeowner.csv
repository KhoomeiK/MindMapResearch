Sure, anything is possible, just depends on how much work to install and repair afterwards.  If you have access to the ceiling from an attic or crawl space this is really easy to do.   If you don't you're going to be cutting holes to help pull wires and drill through joists.  Depends on your setup.

 I did in a few rooms, and used 6"" cans so I could use those holes to pull wires.  One room I was able to do it entirely through those holes except where I came down the wall to the switch.  In the other room I had to make a few holes so I could drill through joists.  My recommendation is to just cut yourself ample holes, drywall is easy to fix.  Personally I'd also use 4"" canless LED lights, even if it meant cutting a few more holes to work with; the 4"" look better, give more even light, and less glare."

And yeah, that too.  Nobody really knows, but I don't have reason to doubt it either.  It's a very bad comparison, but strong rock climbers that don't do any cross training develop a sort of hunchback because of the massive back muscles and weak chest muscles.  They always looked like chronic injuries in formation to me.  I guess I see running with no other form of cross training as a similar imbalance."

DIY,feee4la,t1_feecg0p,1579031880.0,"Perhaps losses isn't the best term.  I'm talking efficiency of the panel relative to the advertised rate.  If I have a 250 watt panel it should give me 250 watts at the same conditions they tested it at.  Probably 70 degrees or so, directly facing the light source of XXXX energy.  I'm sure they also take the measurement in a couple of minutes, before the panel has had time to heat up.  In the real world at best I'd only have a perfect angle for a brief minute, if at all, plus clouds, dust, temp (most panels are significantly hotter than ambient), etc.  That all results in a lower efficiency than the advertised output.   That's what I assumed the 80-85% is, but he goes on to state several other reductions."

DIY,fee6o7h,t1_fee2tt6,1579027507.0,"He's assuming general loses.

The efficiency of panels at converting solar energy is largely irrelevant for the consumer.  Most people design their system off the advertised power production capabilities.  A panel advertised at producing 250 watts will produce 250 watts - at standard test conditions.  In reality you'll get a little less because conditions are never ideal, but you never need to know the actual efficiency of the panels, only the expected efficiency of power generation relative to the advertised value."
DIY,fee6apx,t1_fee2mhm,1579027286.0,"Yeah, that's not correct.  Panels need to output at least as much power as advertised at a standard operating condition.  It's fair to assume 80-85% efficiency when you add in differences in temperature, angle, sun output, cleanliness of the panels, efficiency loss over time, etc.  But he's adding those losses in a second time.

I've had panels for about 4 years now and I find the power generated to be close to estimates."

But it was taking too long to build all that so I just ran it to my table saw in the meantime.

Also, make sure to go in and seal all the open holes in your table saw as best you can, it dramatically affects the efficiency.  However, you're sealing up all those air vents which provide some cooling, so make sure to run your vac when using it."

Sorry to leach on to top comment but it's an important point:

This technically isn't just a burglary, it's a home invasion, since the house was occupied.  OP needs to make that clear when he calls the cops, and call them back if it wasn't made clear the first time.  I was in a similar incident though the alarm scared them off before they could get more than a purse.  Had 4 kids sleeping just down the hall from where they came through the house.  The cops were sort of ambivalent at first, but once we convinced them that someone had been in the house while we were home sleeping they took it very, very seriously.  Must of had 10 officers and detectives there at 2am.  Nothing came of it, but I was glad to see they took it seriously."
