AdultDepression,ff6btma,t3_ernfdw,1579623768.0,Love is superficial. Relationships are bs to me.
AdultDepression,ff6bqkz,t3_ernfdw,1579623713.0,Jealousy is natural. You're going to feel it in life one way or another. Never act as if you're not jealous of something because that would be a lie. What makes a difference is how you control it.
GenderCritical,ff3zcpq,t3_erg8eh,1579552161.0,"It reminds me of when men call women ""fish,"" because they assume that all vaginas stink like fish, but fail to understand that it only smells that way if there's an infection. It's not how we normally smell. These men masquerading as women (i.e. transwomen) are no different from other men disrespecting women. Just men showing their hatred and lack of understanding of women. What's new?"

GenderCritical,fetwi3e,t1_femnt7m,1579380735.0,"Your comment makes me self-conscious. Haha, that's ok. I'm sensitive."
GenderCritical,felu11h,t3_epsuj5,1579230917.0,"I come from a black family, and they place so much value and emphasis on the myth ""Black don't crack."" I've spent countless hours looking at myself in the mirror, worrying if I'm one of those unlucky black women who will ""crack,"" or get wrinkles early, or at all.

Blacks obsess over those who are well into their 40s-50s who look young for their ages, and it worries me how it affects us mentally. It breeds insecurities.

I hate that humans place so much value on looks, especially on women. Stupid us."

GenderCritical,fead93y,t1_feac3qd,1578947199.0,I agree.
Marriage,fea1wds,t1_fe9ltcf,1578943500.0,"I don't think there's any saving it. When someone isn't in love, believe them. You can't make someone have feelings for you. If the feeling isn't there, it isn't there. He should love on, find someone who's interested, and take it slow next time."
TrueOffMyChest,fe9z1hf,t1_fdi83m1,1578942690.0,Couldn't agree more.
relationships,fe9yvde,t1_fdib1zc,1578942637.0,"Why would you assume all blacks use the same practices he does? If a white person washed their hair with grape juice, are you going to assume they all do that? You don't make sense."

Race has nothing to do with how someone smells, and everything to do with the fact that it's THE INDIVIDUAL person who lacks good hygiene. I don't understand why race is relevant here?!"

Vent,fcr2rkj,t3_eie28h,1577895939.0,"I guess I'm lucky. I don't get a lot of attention from guys. They're too much trouble anyways. I shouldn't seek validation from men. They just want something hot and pretty to fuck. 

I'm worth more than a man's fuck. I'm too smart and talented, and I can do more with my life instead of worrying about how desirable I am to men."
GenderCritical,fcgipc4,t3_eh4b56,1577640468.0,"Men are obsessed with how women look, and it makes me sure that's why women obsess over their own looks, worried about how men will view them. I've learned that my validation should not come from men. It is extremely unhealthy to seek validation from them. I can't tell you how much it's been eating me up from the inside, worrying about whether men find me attractive or not."

GenderCritical,fbyzv38,t3_ef6y39,1577230916.0,"Trans ""women"" are not oppressed by the patriarchy. They are literally men choosing to dress like women. Natural women don't get to up and choose one day to be women. They were born that way."
