He seems to feel guilty whenever he makes a slight mistake and he is always working so hard to improve, and I’m not a mind reader, but I would think that he isn’t satisfied with himself. I just want him to know that we are always proud of him and he is always going to be enough. He deserves to understand how special he is, and I would love to help him with knowing that!!"

But if I had to pick just one thing, it’d be the atmosphere. Simply put, the show just wouldn’t have captivated so many of us it wasn’t for the atmosphere. But of course, that wouldn’t have been possible if not for the animation style, the writing, the setting, the colour palette, etc...

If you’re talking about the story itself, I’d make the same point. Jason Funderberker getting a record deal wouldn’t have been as much of a wonderful moment for the show if Greg wasn’t so focused on him throughout the show, specifically in the first episode.

Overall, I love OTGW way too much to make any decisions, and I really think that if even the tiiiiinniiessttt detail was different, the show wouldn’t have been as good."

This live was hilarious, just before this one, Jin and Jimin were live but they ended it just as Jungkook wanted to join them. So JK started this one, with Jimin in the back explaining how JK scolded him. Then just as Jimin was about to leave, Jin joined them and they were joking around, and then Taehyung joined too. It was 13 minutes of pure gold!!"
