ShittyVeganFoodPorn,ffg4ifl,t1_ffg36ul,1579898285.0,"well, you are. wherever people go and whatever they choose to eat requires the displacement and possible destruction of native populations, the blocking or migratory routes, the fragmentation of natural ranges, and the disruption of ecosystems. there is no way to do no harm. none. the goal, then, is to reasonably reduce the total pain, suffering, and hardship among all living things (while also keeping the standard deviation low), which means that anything — especially coming from an enormous company — that moves us in that direction should be supported.

1) i went inside the restaurant to order some impossible whoppers for myself to go.
2) i asked the people in the restaurant if they wanted to try one. some did.
3) i added the impossible whoppers for the people who were interested to my order.
4) i was given my order.

ShittyVeganFoodPorn,fff9z96,t1_fff8m32,1579879330.0,"nothing is vegan. each of us sets a personal line that we use to justify the acceptable level of impact that each of us has on the world around us. (as far as i know, no one here is living completely off the grid.) if i catch a small amount of grease as a result of a shared cooking surface, that’s a cost of doing business that i can justify. that grease was a byproduct of another person’s choice that i had no control over. but, by going into burger king and giving out a few impossible burgers to some open-minded folks who may not have tried one on their own, i may have set some folks off in a new direction that will allow them to make a better choice next time. it may not be perfect, but it’s better.

worldnews,ffdhai2,t1_ffd3wr4,1579820848.0,"so, jeff bauman, who had both his legs blown off just because he happened to take the day off from costco, unknowingly stand next to a pressure cooker bomb, and become the face of “boston strong” should be given tens of millions of dollars while little bobby noname who was orphaned when his whole family was killed in a mudslide that you never heard about will be okay with whatever the general fund can find in between the couch cushions? there needs to be proportion and there needs to be equity. how much a person is cared for in a time of need shouldn’t be a function of national media attention or the the virality of a gofundme page. welcome to late stage capitalism."
worldnews,ffcu1vj,t1_ffcqczt,1579807259.0,"i’m glad that you’re not in charge of fund distribution. people are more likely to give to high profile incidents, which means that under your system victims of low profile incidents, on average, would receive less. tragedy should not be a lottery. that’s why the WWF uses animals like the tiger and the panda as its poster children to raise funds to conserve lesser known (or not as cute) species."

Games,ffc3d35,t1_ffbfibi,1579790530.0,"the point is that the cartridge and disc games of the 80s and 90s are still available to play and can still be bought today, twenty or thirty years out. as long as the media can be inserted into a working console and that console can be hooked up to a compatible television, they’re 100% good to go. although the hardware will become increasingly scarce with time, these games will be remain playable in some form for decades more to come. there’s no drm. there’s no region locking. there’s no online authentication. the consoles and games are completely stand alone.

and, as other people have mentioned, as the storage medium and hardware deteriorate or become scarce, they can be digitally archived and distributed and played freely and indefinitely using emulation software. these games depend on nothing outside of themselves and, as a result, will remain playable in one form or another forever. i can plug in my NES and play it right now just as i did in 1987 with no problem.

this is not necessarily true of most pc and console games released since around 2010 and is certainly not true of almost all mobile games. many require validation via communication with a server just to play. to keep all things equal, we’re talking about being able to play these games in 2043 as they were played in 2010. that’s asking a lot. when that server goes dark, so does the game. not only that, but any content can be pulled or modified at any time and for any reason.

the time of media ownership — music, film, games, etc — is quickly coming to an end as a tradeoff for the short-term convenience of the cloud."
worldnews,ffbsl24,t1_ffbkk03,1579781173.0,"in that system, people who are the victims of high profile tragedies will receive more compensation than victims of small tragedies that no one ever hears about, despite the level of hardship experienced."

worldnews,ffb2b9j,t1_ffaxksc,1579750011.0,"fund allocation is far more important than fund collection. you simply cannot immediately dump all the donated money at once. if that was the case, it would not go very far at all. not to mention that the support must be proportional to the need. high profile events tend to attract more donations than are needed to provide reasonable relief and those donations can (and should) be redistributed to provide relief to those who are affected in ways that we never hear about."
worldnews,ffb1syx,t1_ffap0wh,1579749657.0,"to be fair, they collected way more for 9/11 than the 9/11 victims would ever need and it was right of them to reroute some of that funding to other causes with lower profiles. as an analogy, there was a surge in blood donations for 9/11. should all that blood have been used to treat only 9/11 victims who were in need of blood, of which, due to the circumstances, there were very few? money is no different. the big tragedies with the benefit concerts are what support the significantly larger number of people who are affected just a few at a time by the small scale tragedies that no one ever hears about."
