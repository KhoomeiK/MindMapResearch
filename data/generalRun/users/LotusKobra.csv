Beautiful island paradise, but the cost of living is ridiculous, the authoritarian asiatic culture is oppressive, the gun laws are draconian, and there is nowhere to go except the beach. It's so far away from any noteworthy land mass. Forget going on road trips. I can't even get to the next closest island without getting on an airplane. Weed isn't even gonna be recreation legalized soon. Milk is 5.99 a gallon. There is a lot of homeless people, and there has been an uptick in violent crime.
