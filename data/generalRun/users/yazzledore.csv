He made me love science, taught me ""the beauty of a softly simmering cauldron,"" if you will. 

However, if you were shit at the subject and didn't pay attention, he was pretty mean to you. Made kids cry on the regular, though usually for doing something dumb/dangerous like sticking your head out a sixth floor window or playing with the outlets on a lab bench.

I can see how Snape would be a caricature of that teacher from a student who didn't get along with him. I bet if we saw him from Malfoy's perspective he'd be portrayed totally differently. I liked that essay for making me see that perspective, but it could have used a ~~little~~ lot of nuance."

Has a lot of political voldy. It's unfinished but still worth the read, longer than many finished ones as is. Writing is great plot-wise, maybe the best in a fic I've seen, but grammar is kinda rough in the beginning (I made a habit of counting how many screwed up homonyms got thrown around, ones I'd never seen before) but improves dramatically as it goes on. 

It's less Harry fighting with him and more just dealing with him, since it's a fic in which voldy won the first war, and it's long so it takes a while to get to all the politics. But when it does we get some cool international pols too, not a thing that happens in most fics."
