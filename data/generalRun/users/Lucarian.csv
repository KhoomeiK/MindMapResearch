PublicFreakout,ff3y0d8,t1_ff3wbqk,1579551320.0,"Eh, we aren’t really disregarding it, just viewing it as an accident made by the actions of what appears to be two inexperienced wrestlers rather than a deliberate attempt to try paralyse the kid like a lot of the other comments are making out."

PublicFreakout,ff3pjyt,t1_ff3lggi,1579546092.0,"Seems like he is returning to position to continue, not collapsing. Either way the dad would have been running to assault the kid before he “collapsed”."
PublicFreakout,ff3omsd,t1_ff3m7da,1579545531.0,How did the reach behind occur because of the illegal drop? He hadn’t been dropped when he reached backwards to try to grab him in a headlock.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ff3mrrq,t1_ff1ih2u,1579544382.0,False and the first 48 hours are the most crucial.

nothingeverhappens,ff391jv,t1_ff35dp3,1579536550.0,I don’t think anyone would deny that the Soviets wouldn’t have reached Berlin as quickly as they did if there wasn’t a D-day. I really don’t understand the point of this comment.

todayilearned,ff2l9hn,t1_ff2kg98,1579511429.0,$28USD is like $40. I don’t think even the most expensive brands cost that much yet.

AmItheAsshole,ff2agtv,t1_ff0pt10,1579498679.0,"You didn’t address my point. Birth control can fail, doesn’t mean she intentionally got pregnant."
AmItheAsshole,fezwscs,t1_feyqx6o,1579462681.0,Who said it was intentional?
AmItheAsshole,fezqdce,t3_eqvx55,1579460328.0,"NTA. I would mention it in the review. Sure, maybe it was an honest mistake. Or maybe that is what all the previous girls thought so no one mentioned his inappropriate behaviour. At the very least by including it in your review you will make it much more likely he won’t do it again."
AmItheAsshole,fezpifu,t1_fez9o7s,1579460037.0,Even a wedge of wood to chock the door shut would do the same job and be cheaper.
AskReddit,fetbyod,t1_feronb2,1579373722.0,"I saw them last year when they were in Melbourne.  Overall I found the show a bit disappointing. Lead singer got pretty upset when the only lyrics to Inis Mona the crowd knew was “close my eyes, inis mona” lol"
todayilearned,fen1fnl,t1_femx443,1579274830.0,"What I’ve gathered from the comments is that it was a combination of the ideas he was expressing as well as the way he expressed them, like using that phrase. Seems it was actually his sister-in-law that read it and suspected him and then she asked her brother to read the manifesto."
PublicFreakout,fegw4oj,t1_fegoxc4,1579103861.0,A while ago near where I live in Australia there was a car crash at an intersection. Paramedics arrive and start treating the driver when they realise he had been shot in the head. Long story short a firearm in the back of his car went off when he crashed and killed the driver. Unfortunately I don’t know any more details about it but it was some of he worst luck I had head of.

history,fecq9cb,t1_fe97hm6,1578980678.0,"Yeah he really dropped the ball on a couple of episodes, one of the biggest ones in memory being Apocolypto. He spends a large portion of the episode complaining about how the movie had a messed up historical timeline because he was convinced it was during one time period and any of the indications that it was actually set in a later time period, which is was, are chalked up to mistakes made by the movie."
todayilearned,fe8mhe9,t1_fe8hzmb,1578927937.0,"It probably was at some point. Hell even after people explaining it to me I remembered I had watched a video about this a few weeks ago. Space never really was too big an interest of mine though, history has always been my main interest and I feel like 80% of my memory is dedicated to it."

AmItheAsshole,fe6csek,t1_fe5hb6y,1578887169.0,If he had his own hang ups with his fatherhood that he needed to work through before publicly revealing that he is a father then that is fine as long as he is in the child’s life. However you can’t post public pictures online with your child to make yourself look good while not acknowledging he is your child.

AmItheAsshole,fdqf9t3,t1_fcyh0vo,1578665171.0,If he didn’t want to spend longer at the gym to get his workout done he probably shouldn’t have invited her to workout with him.

MorbidReality,fdo5ml7,t1_fdo4qrz,1578599313.0,I am pretty sure those stats are for being sexually abused during someone’s lifetime. The child abuse stats wouldn’t be too far off though.

cringe,fbxen1o,t3_eeomf9,1577183373.0,The biggest problem is her delivery. While it wouldn't have made her set any funnier it would have made it a lot less boring if she put some fucking energy into what she was saying.
AskReddit,fbgpq52,t1_fbgn0t0,1576855711.0,Apparently they finished it off with a graphic novel or something just in case you hadn’t heard about that.
