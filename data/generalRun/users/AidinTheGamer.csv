FragileWhiteRedditor,fgno6d7,t1_fgm95kb,1580949179.0,Even some people on r/unpopularopinions agree with this lol
FragileWhiteRedditor,fgnn2g7,t1_fglubvv,1580948449.0,I posted something saying that cyberbullying is a stupid concept and it got donvoted and I got insulted in the comments because... My opinion was unpopular.

unpopularopinion,fgl01er,t1_fgkzkmm,1580877936.0,"I completely understand this. I'm in the ""younger"" crowd online and I see it happening myself. I just feel that social media allows for you to decide what you feel comfortable with and if you don't want to be harassed, block them. Some people are more sensitive and I understand that. But people are given the tools to block out those they don't want to hear from. I just find it absurd when people are so upset about what people say online (not necessarily because I think they shouldn't feel bad, because I know it hurts some people more) but because they're ignoring what they need to solve the problem."
unpopularopinion,fgkzp3w,t1_fgkzitm,1580877660.0,"So what would you call it when a random person insults another random person online? It's cyberbullying.

Cyber = on the internet
Bullying = well, bullying

My title was phrased bad. Yes, it does exist. I just find the concept stupid."
unpopularopinion,fgkzg1d,t1_fgkzdm3,1580877463.0,"It's completely different to give up on your job you love than to ignore a ""bully"" online."

unpopularopinion,fgkz9bp,t1_fgkz2ol,1580877321.0,"He wasn't going to drop everything online because of him being cancelled. He's not just going to go ""Well, nothing I can do."" And go work a regular job. He responded and cleared up the situation. He didn't actually sexually assault anyone from the information we ended up with. He isn't going to let himself get cancelled for something he didn't do."
unpopularopinion,fgkz33j,t1_fgkynj1,1580877186.0,I don't see anywhere on the Wikipedia page that says it's limited to affecting you in real life.
unpopularopinion,fgkysxz,t1_fgkylb9,1580876969.0,"I'm not making a living off the internet. If some random person accuses me of a crime online, it won't affect me. With James Charles, the rumors spread and it threatened to destroy his only income. There is no way that's equal. When Slazo went silent for a while after he got cancelled, he got more and more hate as time goes on. Cancel culture is shitty. Cyberbullying from random people on the internet is inconsequential and shouldn't matter that much."
unpopularopinion,fgky9cp,t1_fgky41p,1580876554.0,"I didn't say delete your account, but just ignore the comments or block them. Nobody is making you listen to the people making fun of you, so don't."
unpopularopinion,fgky4v2,t1_fgky2q6,1580876457.0,"I said that lol. If it's actually going to affect your personal life day to day, it's not just cyberbullying anymore."
unpopularopinion,fgky0te,t1_fgkt9f9,1580876371.0,"Well they still get goddamn upvotes, so we seem to be the vocal minority."
unpopularopinion,fgkxxf6,t3_eypcqn,1580876301.0,This is more of a shower thought. Might be too controversial for that subreddit though.
unpopularopinion,fgkxo0z,t1_fgkxjfq,1580876105.0,"The difference though is if you can avoid it. James Charles couldn't just block everyone badmouthing him and move on, but if some random person started accusing me of sexual assault, I'd probably just roll my eyes and ignore them."
unpopularopinion,fgkxath,t1_fgkwdh4,1580875832.0,I'm saying words don't hurt if they're from some random person online that has absolutely no bearing on your life.
unpopularopinion,fgkx746,t1_fgkwyns,1580875758.0,"Yes. It is unavoidable. If you have a large enough online presence to be cancelled, then most likely your life is spent being well known, and when everyone turns against you, you can't just ignore them like if you're an average Joe getting made fun of online. Cyberbullying doesn't ruin careers, cancel culture does."
unpopularopinion,fgkwzan,t1_fgkwwx2,1580875601.0,Big example is Bullyhunters. Obviously it got made fun of but it existed because people were so upset they got made fun of on a video game.
unpopularopinion,fgkwpys,t1_fgkwmob,1580875416.0,"I mentioned that. If it is completely online, it isn't really affecting you. In a lot of cases, it does end up following them into the real world and actually affecting them. I'm not denying that.

At that point it's just bullying. Not online bullying."

unpopularopinion,fgksxoz,t3_eyrrjr,1580872900.0,"I have Reddit for entertainment, I have Twitter to keep up to date, and I have Snapchat to talk with friends. Imo, that's all you need from social media."
