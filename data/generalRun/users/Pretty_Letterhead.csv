AskWomen,ffezlnm,t3_et8yt7,1579871460.0,I have a mandatory work meeting today. Our new general manager will be there. I'm uncomfortable in groups and in presence of higher ups. I'll go but I don't want to participate in conversations or give input. Today's my day off. The last place I wanna be is work.
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffew8fn,t3_et6yzs,1579868132.0,"There is no justification for this brutality. Were the tiger actively attacking someone, then I might see some intervention. However these pieces of shit went after a fleeing animal and beat it to death. Then they refused to allow anyone to treat the tiger's injuries. They wanted her to suffer and die in agony. The people in that video are absolutely total pieces of shit!"
NoStupidQuestions,fex1ks6,t3_eqsb2q,1579422821.0,"I never realized it before, but I do this as well. In my case it's when I'm vomiting. I think it's a way to soothe myself because I hate throwing up. So I sort of hum a little between bouts."
personalfinance,fewwfsx,t1_fewplii,1579420541.0,You'll probably have to contact whoever does the payroll for your company.
AskWomen,feo1vi8,t1_feo08j5,1579294056.0,Okay. I'll have to try that. Thanks.
AskWomen,fenz2pj,t1_fenwowq,1579292924.0,Dry body brushing is new to me. How do you do it? What do you use to brush?
AskWomen,fenyw3g,t1_fenrpdb,1579292831.0,"I do the same thing. I see it as a to each their own sort of thing. I had very dark hair on my arms that made me feel self conscious. Now I periodically shave and feel at ease when people see my arms. Sure its not something I *have to do, it's just what I like."

Your younger sister hasn't realized yet what kind of impact your mom's actions will have on her life. She'll learn it quick though when trying to move out and be on her own. 

What your mom did to you and your sister, and likely is currently doing to your brother, is wrong. Not filing a report will just allow her to continue using and abusing her kids. Yes, this will cause friction right now, but I'd bet someday your younger siblings realize how you did the right thing. 

Please, file the report and start the process of getting your life back in order."
iamatotalpieceofshit,feldia4,t3_epo329,1579219624.0,"These psychotic little shits are going to grow up and continue their brutality well into adulthood. To burn a living creature alive as something fun to do...jesus I feel bad for all their future victims. The fact that the punishment was so pathetic, only enforces how inconsequential the cruelty of animals is in their eyes. These are not just boys/kids messing around...if there is such a thing as karma, I hope it catches up with every one of them!"
depression,feiz01c,t3_ep0uj5,1579151220.0,"I'm super self conscious about my teeth. I know they're bad. Crooked, stained, and weak. I didn't go to the dentist regularly as a child and didn't learn the importance of brushing my teeth. Now I'm an adult and I'm still not going, because I am that ashamed. This would be my nightmare.

Truthfully though, you need a new dentist. She, even if she's great at the actual work on people's teeth, seriously lacks people skills and is insensitive. She could have easily said something like 'we have a lot of work to do, but we'll get the job done.' Anything other than straight up insulting you. I would do some kind of complaint or review or something to let others know the type of person they're working with. I mean the look of a person's teeth is a very touchy subject. Some people just don't think before they speak."
depression,feiy64v,t3_ep842q,1579150500.0,"I'm with you. Sometimes it hits me just how incredibly alone I am. I am nobody's first thought, favorite person, best friend...whatever. I'm an afterthought. I'm someone who people forget about until they see me or somebody mentions my name. I'm not special to anybody."
iamatotalpieceofshit,feh2mhz,t3_ep492k,1579107853.0,"Now this dude is an absolute piece of shit! He's a pathetic excuse of a man who needs to berate and abuse those around him behind closed doors to feel big. He's seriously someone who needs to meet somebody his own size who will give him a taste of his own medicine. 

And for all those who doubted this girl and brushed off what she was saying...I hope they live with the guilt knowing how badly they failed her!"
SuicideWatch,fe131yc,t3_enkbt4,1578821908.0,I'm where you are. 31 and have progressed very little in the last decade. I don't have too many fond memories or wonderful experiences to look back on. I've lived a lot of my life in fear and isolation. I wish I could give some advice to the younger me.
SuicideWatch,fe11ud1,t3_enkgaa,1578821524.0,I've had these exact thoughts. I seem to care for others so much more than they actually care for me. Even relatives...I don't mean a whole lot to people. My absence would have very little impact.
LadyBoners,fd07tm4,t3_ejq2my,1578114922.0,He's the epitome of handsome and charming! I swoon every time I see a picture of him!
TooAfraidToAsk,fcwrgym,t3_ej63yw,1578034680.0,"For me it's more the simple joys of life that I'm missing. Best friends, significant others, good family relationships...

I enjoy the movies/shows at first, but sooner or later I'm just reminded of how sad my life is. (Yes, my fault, but still.)"
depression,fctp9f4,t3_eivdpv,1577952573.0,"What you're saying does make sense because it's something I'm very familiar with. It's not to the extent of having a plan or a date, but the thought is there. And you're right, it sucks because it isn't something you can bring up to people without generally sending off huge alarm bells and causing an overreaction. I can definitely relate..."

Yes the 13 year old is at a difficult age and probably struggles with her parents divorce...

HOWEVER that does not excuse her behavior. Giving her the necklace would be a sign to her that she can be as pissy as she wants and still get whatever she wants. The dad should have stood up more and let her know that her behavior and attitude were unacceptable. 

Counseling could very well be beneficial for her. She clearly has some issues she is struggling with and, being that young, does not know how to resolve them on her own. An impartial third party trained to deal with teens might be able to reach her in a way the rest of you cannot. 

In short, don't give her the necklace. Maybe keep it tucked away for the day when you two have reached a positive place in your relationship, but that's up to you. Best of luck. You're in a tough spot."

You're breaking the law. He's breaking the law. Don't get me wrong, it's not his fault that the law changed...but it is what it is. Would you buy an underage person alcohol? No. So why are you buying an underage person cigarettes? 

Also I have less sympathy towards you both since you admitted he's been heavily smoking since he was 16...if you get caught doing this for him, then you deserve whatever punishment you get."
AskReddit,fc88aum,t3_egpb0t,1577529114.0,I lost someone who meant a great deal to me. She passed from cancer. Her passing has reminded me of everyone who I have loved and lost...the fact I'll never see any of those people again just breaks my heart. Life has lost almost all joy and happiness.
depression,fbz21fy,t3_ef1j86,1577232720.0,Christmas has just lost all its meaning to me. I don't want to be around anyone. I prefer not to acknowledge it at all if possible. The only thing I look forward to is that I get paid more when I work that particular day.
