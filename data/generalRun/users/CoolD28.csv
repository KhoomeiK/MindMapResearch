memes,ffw2f99,t1_ffvzt9r,1580281424.0,"It’s a myth. When cracking fingers it actually releases a fluid that helps the joints move better. There was a unofficial experiment by a guy who cracked his knuckles on his left hand for 50 years while not doing it to his right hand. Both hands were the same, with the left not having more arthritis.

Edit: When I say for 50 years I mean every day of each year, so 18263 times. Sorry for the ambiguity"
ADHD,ffv2uom,t1_ffux6te,1580254398.0,"9 years in for me, still can’t find the right meds. It also has to do with me only being 16 rn, and during adolescence you constantly need to redosage meds. But it’s a terrible feeling as you don’t fully know if it is working or not."

ADHD,ffsfc4w,t3_euuoe8,1580180322.0,"I hate the feeling that I will have to always take pills, it can sometimes be just so degrading. And especially when people who don’t take pills talk about taking pills, it angers me. But then I get past that and realize how my thoughts start to make sense when I say them out loud.

My booster is wearing out so I’m a jumble of a mess. But I feel the same way about them."
ADHD,ffsdts6,t3_euz3u7,1580179306.0,"As for where to get tested and what type of doctor, you should ask whoever you currently see (ur current doctor) as they might know where to get tested. I got diagnosed 9 years ago when I was 7, and since then have been seeing an ADHD doctor who prescribes my medicine.

But for the focus and fidgeting, they can be helped with medication and can definitely help you achieve your goal of being a pilot. Things sort of clear up when you get diagnosed and are on the right prescriptions, but it isn’t a one thing fix all sort of stuff. 

Sorry if this wasn’t too helpful."
