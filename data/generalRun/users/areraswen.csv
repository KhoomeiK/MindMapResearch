I think the logic is that the amount of people willing to cancel goes down when you increase the amount of actual ""human"" interaction they need to get there."

My sister died suddenly and had no friends. It was an important step to verify that she kept no important documents on her hardware, but I knew she was in to freaky porn. It makes tons of sense, you just don't have the context required and are making assumptions."
DicePorn,feldp7x,t1_feklicl,1579219752.0,"It's entirely possible. Lab dice are ""experiments"" and supposedly the hits are supposed to go into production. That being said, it seems like the quality of these dice in particular can be highly variable in regards to coloring; I've seen many people state they've received lackluster sets and had to contact chessex for replacement pieces. I imagine chessex will need to take this risk into account when determining whether the nebula line is worth full production. I don't know what their decision will be. People seem to love these dice though. Imagine dropping $40+ on a set only to have them go into full production for $12."

AskReddit,fecyotd,t3_eodtd1,1578990116.0,"My sister became addicted to prescription drugs and could never pull out of the nosedive it sent her into. She weighed over 400 lbs, had to have all her teeth removed at 23 and replaced with dentures... and she died at 25, alone, in an alley in between a bar and her house. Cause of death was od + alcohol.

I tried so many times to convince her to get help. We all did. When our mom passed she lost all her will to live and was dead within 6 months."

dice,fdy73dt,t1_fdwxetl,1578776785.0,"Unless all the other dice were always forcing back to one specific number, you should be okay to use them still. The salt test sometimes overexaggerates the flaws in these dice. The only way to get precision rolling is to buy something specifically for that. I'm pretty sure that not even gamescience dice roll balanced, and they're supposed to specialise in dice that roll better than normal. 

Take this source with a grain of salt since awesome dice could be considered a competitor. https://www.awesomedice.com/blogs/news/d20-dice-randomness-test-chessex-vs-gamescience

Anyway I think a better random test method is to roll each die 100 times and average it out. But that's just me."

I once needed to hurl and my bf didn't pull over fast enough, so I rolled down the window but ended up puking all over the side of the door. So... puke bag is a must for me now.

I keep a pharmacy in my actual purse because of conventions etc., rather than having it in my car. Tylenol, advil (for others), migraine medication, dramamine. I also carry kratom with me, which helps when I have bad pain."

I was petting him last night on that same cat castle-- it has 3 tiers-- when I see a glint inside the middle tier, under Roland's baby blanket.

I reach in and pull out... my Christmas necklace! Missing since before Christmas when I took it off after a work party. It is shiny and covered in bells so I'm not totally surprised. 🤣"
