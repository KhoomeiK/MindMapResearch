PropagandaPosters,fh7zb11,t1_fh70l6c,1581348475.0,The problem with pissing on Margaret Thatcher's grave is that eventually you run out of piss.

holdmyfeedingtube,fh15d4n,t1_fh0wh0k,1581210983.0,I mean you’re probably right but I felt bad for the girl in the car. She was a sitting duck.
holdmyfeedingtube,fh0uci1,t1_fgzi2qj,1581207598.0,Not dead. Unless I have some Beetlejuice shit going on. But I didn’t see a Handbook for the Recently Deceased on my nightstand when I got home.
holdmyfeedingtube,fh0dl0f,t1_fh0d3eq,1581202757.0,Not worth it. 1 star Yelp review on being hit by a car.
holdmyfeedingtube,fh0d08r,t1_fgz9qie,1581202545.0,"To be fair to the cops, I think it just happened and they were attending the fire. That’s why OP and I were the first responders on the scene to the car in the video."
holdmyfeedingtube,fh0c4q4,t3_f0u36n,1581202276.0,"I should add that OP ran into action after this video and rescued the girl I attempted to help. She brought her to safety in my car until more cops and firefighters came to secure the scene.

Instead of giving me and my comments awards she deserves some. OP is my fiancé. She actually conducted the rescue. I just got hit by a car lol. She sprung into action even after filming what she thought was my death."
holdmyfeedingtube,fh00av6,t1_fgzxtgf,1581199363.0,"That’s exactly what he said. He also said that if he didn’t see my reflectors on my jacket at the last minute he would have slammed her head on at 80mph. It was a glancing blow at 60mph and he veered off into the ditch after impact, hitting me in the process.

He apologized multiple times for almost killing me. Which is a weird conversation to have with someone you hit with your car on a highway."
AskReddit,fgz02wf,t1_fgy4mfk,1581189168.0,You can usually spot Aztecs in Mexico from the Acuahuitls they carry around with them.
holdmyfeedingtube,fgys6vj,t1_fgyrf88,1581186402.0,Lol agreed.
holdmyfeedingtube,fgyphgj,t1_fgyp5fn,1581185557.0,"I’m the guy who got hit last night- didn’t require a feeding tube and I walked away. 

Her car was disabled in the third lane of the highway because she rear ended someone and the guy drove off. I tried getting her out before another accident could happen. Didn’t exactly work out as planned.

As you can see there was another car engulfed in flames. The first responders were attending to that because I’m pretty sure there was someone inside. It was like a warzone."
InfowarriorRides,fgy3gur,t1_fgy1efa,1581179069.0,Interesting. Any reason they’re drawn to the profession?
facepalm,fgy2rvc,t1_fgs6mn0,1581178952.0,"Well if he dies it helps with the lawsuits, but otherwise your kid is still dead."
boston,fgt7s1v,t1_fgt6wkh,1581100600.0,"It would need to be done at the federal level, I believe. The Supreme Court routinely sides with cops on qualified immunity."
boston,fgstp0z,t1_fgsrlk8,1581092444.0,Also cops: Go ahead- try and sue me. I'm immune.
bostonceltics,fgrsnt0,t3_f01ioo,1581056164.0,"People setting their hair on fire because we didn’t get Capella or Drummond. Neither are big difference makers. 

The team is getting healthier and playing well. Let’s just keep this going and see where it leads."
curb,fgrhxq3,t1_fgrevzz,1581047248.0,"They’re different in Europe I guess. But every one I’ve had in America are dry, powdery, granulated messes. And when you look at how they’re made, it makes you mad. They take something that’s essentially 50% butter and a lot of sugar and turn it into this awful dry pastry."
spicy,fgmkf39,t3_ezbues,1580926371.0,Ok but who's going to eat those?? lol
curb,fgmjzut,t1_fgmjai7,1580926124.0,Right? A soft scone with a muffin-like texture is much more appealing.
curb,fgmdrr9,t3_eza6ls,1580922589.0,I'm with Richard Lewis on this one- scones are fucking awful.
