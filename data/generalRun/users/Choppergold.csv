I tell people I've trained in selling how important it is to be themselves, not some sales-idea of a salesperson. Some are quieter, some want to use more trend information or things like that; some like to have a fun tone. This technique is like Al Pacino shouting at Jack Lemmon, it's just cheesy manipulation and disrespect"
