When an entire business model is built on punishing its customers, the company is a hog ready for slaughter ripe to be disrupted by more efficient, less punishing delivery methods. The blockbuster CEO was so arrogant that he didn't think to use some of the cash that they're sitting on to buy out rivals while they're still fruit on the vine (like Microsoft).  He truly believed that the good times would continue forever.

I'm glad blockbuster flat out refused to buy Netflix, especially since Netflix has been producing great content.  Blockbuster is culturally irrelevant because with all the millions the company generated, they produced NO content"

 I live in Houston and the homeless issues here are worse than Jax but still not bad. Oakland actually has a true homeless problem. 


Crime is not that big of an issue. Unless you plan on living in northwest Jax west of the zoo on hecksher drive, you won’t run into any systemic crime issues.  

My dad’s accountant used to have an office in that northwest Jax west of the zoo. She’s was well respected in the community so there was a rule that she was not to be touched. But when I worked for her I’d always try to leave by 2 pm."

The second is reduction of beryllium. Beryllium in blast media causes disease that compromises your immune system and can eventually lead to cancer.

Karen got her shit handed to her because she was not transparent in her paperwork but bragged about to everyone in earshot that she basically got away with falsifying her travel. 


If Karen got away with her crap, she would’ve been found out eventually because her fraud would escalate. Then the policy would change to disallow travel for professional development. Your wife set a positive precedent for everyone who remains above board and prevent negative precedents from coming to pass."

Before instapots, you has to use a stove top pressure cooker which were freaking dangerous.  Nowadays it’s just drop the off oxtail in a instapot and wait 30 to 45 minutes. 


Growing up, the food that I loved for my mom to cook is a Filipino dish called kare kare.
