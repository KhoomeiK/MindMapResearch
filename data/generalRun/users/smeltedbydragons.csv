creepyPMs,ff62abd,t3_erhbyu,1579617322.0,He’s really gotta stop using his supposed autism as an excuse. Autistic people aren’t automatically boundaryless assholes and him perpetrating the stereotype isn’t cool.
truscum,ff1v8jp,t1_ff0p6ip,1579486934.0,That’s why I don’t go on mainstream trans subreddits. They suck and are full of that toxic ideology.
BikiniBottomTwitter,ff1v5sy,t1_fezrurz,1579486886.0,You could reverse it and call it the fuck zone for the person needing to reject their friend. No one is obligated to a relationship with someone and it’s annoying seeing people bitch and moan about it. Boo hoo everyone gets rejected grow tf up
pointlesslygendered,feypuso,t1_feym76e,1579448980.0,Alright someone needs to lay off the edgy meme pages

truscum,feph9fy,t3_eq2tz8,1579320452.0,Don’t even try. The mod there was an immature kid who misconstrued what I was saying and then muted me after I confronted them about my ban. It’s not worth it.
FTMMen,fepg5zr,t1_feodmjw,1579319672.0,This isn’t a competition. We don’t choose our paths and just because some have it easier doesn’t mean they aren’t allowed to speak about topics or share their experiences for fear of offending someone.
truscum,fepfc9m,t1_fep7nfs,1579319091.0,"If it was socially defined dysphoria wouldn’t be real. We don’t need a god to do that we have science and proof that the only people that benefit from transition are dysphoria people. Those without dysphoria who transition always go back. That and the countless studies proving quality of life improvement as well as studies on brain sex more then prove that dysphoria is the reasonable medical cause for being trans. 

More then anything dysphoria isn’t in my imagination. None of this experience is imagined, it’s all very really and painful."

fatlogic,femvapg,t3_eq0je2,1579270555.0,Yeah that’s more accurate to a 5’6” or 5’7” woman. When my mom was about that weight her body type looked more like this diagram. 5’3” at this weight would look much uh fatter for lack of a better word.

FTMMen,felwiyr,t3_epullu,1579232704.0,You need to be at a certain T level in your blood stream (I think it’s the blood stream) before it stops. My clinic checks levels and will let me know when I can go off neproxin due to my levels being high enough so I never have it.
boomershumor,felvk6o,t1_felugqt,1579232011.0,But does it actually matter that much to shame people for it. My answer is no it doesn’t because it’s literally just driving a car.
truscum,felr621,t1_fell1je,1579228930.0,Just a little bit. It’s just what the mental health field has to do right now since there isn’t much proven science around being trans. My mom works in the field and says that that’s what’s expected. Also it’s apart of their training to “meet clients where they are” so even if they aren’t trans but they think they are their counselors have to just meet them where they are.

truscum,felanyr,t3_epnw7n,1579217743.0,Why the term gender diverse though? Aren’t we all just trans? It seems like a pointless term and I’ve heard it thrown around the mental health community a lot and personally I think it sounds stupid and I don’t like having to “identify” with it.
niceguys,fel9l3o,t1_fel96a3,1579217053.0,Incel much
leopardgeckos,fekjpcb,t3_epls37,1579201469.0,Hand treadmills. Get her out and just deal with the panic zoomies a few times until she gets desensitized to being around you and knows you don’t mean any harm.
pointlesslygendered,fejqcxv,t1_feje3rp,1579183170.0,That’s not what I was saying but ok cool ted talk.
pointlesslygendered,feiqbk4,t1_feioieg,1579144555.0,What.
pointlesslygendered,feiqa4p,t1_feioti2,1579144529.0,Yeah it’s really not ideal especially for vulnerable people questioning their identity. I’ve read more then a few testimonials from cis people who fell into that line of thinking and got really depressed. Being trans is no joke.
pointlesslygendered,feiklcj,t1_feihbob,1579140707.0,That sub is very toxic and hivemindy. Many former members were actually brainwashed into thinking they were trans over superficial stuff like liking pink or playing as girls in video games. It’s really not great.
pointlesslygendered,feifpbx,t1_feiei5k,1579137450.0,Absolutely not.
truscum,fehunhm,t3_ep8de9,1579124208.0,It’s woke bisexuality in my opinion. I don’t think gender factors into most people’s minds if they’re bi anyway. It’s unnecessary and useless to id as pan.
truscum,fehuexi,t1_fehtt0x,1579124071.0,Yeah that was really disturbing. Also suing the salon for not waxing his hairy balls was so shitty. He probably would have gotten off at making those ladies do that. No dysphoric trans woman would want someone waxing those parts.
truscum,fehpbio,t3_ep7ohk,1579121174.0,He is definitely not trans he’s a fetishist. He deserves to rot in jail because of the inappropriate things he’s done. Also I definitely agree that he makes actual trans people look like shit. He’s a real pedo and it doesn’t help the far right alright tries to associate pedos with us.
IncelTears,fehngna,t1_fegk16t,1579120103.0,Egg sucks run while you still can.
fatlogic,feglpaq,t1_feghqva,1579096617.0,Yeah no thanks. You’re not marginalized because you’re obese and can’t control your food addiction.
truscum,fefhg9s,t3_eovrwn,1579056400.0,If you want to waste your time then sure you can try. It’s a kind thing to do but he most likely won’t listen. At this point you can’t force him to listen to reason so he’s just going to have to learn on his own.
fatlogic,feffqbd,t3_eotyif,1579055374.0,Why did they have to specify cis. Don’t put me or any other trans person in an other category all the time or put us on some pedestal. Treat us like normal human beings.
ballpython,feffkhu,t1_fef9ygs,1579055274.0,Poor girl! Snakes are hard if you don’t do everything right. It’s a shame large breeders can’t more thoroughly check to ensure their snakes are going to good homes.
truscum,fef3nzu,t1_feevqq0,1579047418.0,you’re a what now?
ballpython,fef3lbt,t1_feewvp2,1579047369.0,I’m glad she’s a rescue! I don’t support the breeding of animals with these kinds of defects and it’s refreshing to see rescues instead of people buying them because they are pretty. I hope she improves.
ballpython,feeqv1b,t3_emja40,1579039276.0,Does she have any wobbles?
truscum,feedryz,t1_feedd1h,1579031674.0,It is but it’s not just not caring about gender like so many cis people think. It’s still being at odds with it.
pointlesslygendered,fee9d93,t1_fee93tj,1579029094.0,How about we don’t do that.
AskReddit,febhaqg,t3_eo83cx,1578958780.0,"Absolutely. It’s for our safety mostly, trans women are especially vulnerable to violence from partners who weren’t made aware. It’s also fair to the other person. They may think they are consenting to sex with a person with a penis when that isn’t the case."

FTMMen,fdw4o2a,t1_fdsbol2,1578755010.0,Wow alright. I see you’ve been brainwashed into this line of thinking so I’m not going to continue this conversation with you. I sincerely hope you pull yourself out and realize the world doesn’t hate you because you’re fat.
FTMMen,fds50ji,t1_fds0eo3,1578694494.0,There’s no such thing as naturally fat. You’re either in a healthy weight range or you arent. If you’re referring to people with genetically slower metabolisms who need less food then sure. You sound like you’ve been sucked into fat activism pseudoscience.

truscum,fdm4ple,t3_em2pzq,1578539735.0,Something that will square your face. Longer on the top and short sides works well for me. Too short and you will look more like a butch lesbian (I learned the hard way lol).

leopardgeckos,fdm3akm,t1_fdloc1z,1578538791.0,I hope someone makes one soon. I might honestly at this point.

FTMMen,fdfr2bf,t1_fdfhos0,1578368136.0,No and yes. It only applies to gay men for the most part. It’s an old ban from the 80s back during the aids scare. Even if two non hiv carrying men in a long monogamous relationship wanted to donate they couldn’t. However a straight person with hiv still can. Because they are straight and therefore can’t get the gay disease.
truscum,fddnsrn,t1_fddetzb,1578318971.0,The people who are “trans” without dysphoria though don’t need to steal the label. They are gnc and that’s all. It’s damaging for both the gnc people and us to be lumped together in the same group.

boomershumor,fcx9cdl,t3_ejccir,1578056268.0,Not really. The guy seemed pretty alarmed at that information. In the real world she needed to let him know that before they even met up for her safety.
reddeadredemption,fcx953g,t1_fcwmcbe,1578056068.0,Idk why you’re being downvoted. I also thought his voice was very annoying. I don’t think they casted his voice actor well.

FTMMen,fcuexm0,t3_eiz373,1577979315.0,It depends on how old you are. If you start before your growth plates have fused then it might affect height for a short time until they do. If you start after they close then you won’t grow.
FTMMen,fcueuh8,t1_fcudy20,1577979262.0,No it’s not. Your growth plates fused long ago. That’s probably because your posture is better now.

leopardgeckos,fct0sc7,t1_fcsi1cx,1577929920.0,You’re valuing if he deserves care based on how much you spent to buy him? That’s not how pet ownership works dude. Go give him to someone who’ll actually take care of him if you aren’t willing to spend money on him. If you’re broke you shouldn’t have pets anyway.
FTMMen,fcslzgb,t1_fcskqwg,1577919370.0,He’s only appealing to his often homophobic and transphobic base. He personally doesn’t give a shit about anyone but himself.

truscum,fcm0pmu,t3_ehup5a,1577761199.0,"To be honest with you (if it’s financially reasonable) it sounds like you need a proper therapist to talk all of this out with. It really really does help when you have someone professional who can help you sort through these thoughts. My mom is one and depending on your location she might be able to help you find one as she has quite a few connections. I wish you luck with your journey, it’s never easy for any of us."
AskReddit,fclvoka,t3_ehquh9,1577757599.0,"I think practically it’s too hard to strictly enforce. However, I feel like incentives could encourage good parenting and lifestyle habits. If you are below a certain income level for example, you’ll get some financial incentive to not have kids until you’re more stable (this may be more relevant in very poor countries with over population issues). Maybe if you don’t pass a parenting competency test then you can still have kids but you just won’t get any incentives. If you don’t have kids and fail then you do. This test won’t scrutinize certain techniques of parenting it’ll just critique if you’re going to beat your kids or disown them for being different (ex. Lgbt). This way you aren’t actually policing anyone’s reproduction."

niceguys,fcivxci,t1_fciskp0,1577671094.0,Yeah that’s what it sounded like to me too. Still not an excuse though. Any relationship needs consent and healthy boundaries set before hand especially ones that involve power dynamics.

FTMMen,fcgkbsn,t3_eh8kzf,1577641037.0,I’ve been banned from all for saying dysphoria or “truscum” don’t suck related things. They are very hive minded subs and I’m personally not a fan.

pointlesslygendered,fc7amo0,t1_fc726pg,1577501962.0,Eh they are red green color blind. So their range of colors are diminished but they don’t see anything in black and white.
pointlesslygendered,fc71ep2,t1_fc6zae4,1577494959.0,"Awesome. My opinion still is that gender is more then that and is innate within every person. That’s why dysphoria exists, because there’s a biological mismatch. My definition of gender is different. I would still refer to the definition you showed as gender roles and stereotypes."
pointlesslygendered,fc6uzok,t1_fc545ow,1577490191.0,Gender isn’t the social construct. Gender ROLES are. Gender is what makes someone comfortable or not at their sex. Transgender people exist because gender is an actual biological thing that exists in our brains.

pointlesslygendered,fc5lh1k,t1_fc4u5ko,1577460758.0,Being trans isn’t a choice smart one. Your gender is innate within your brain. I didn’t choose this life and it’s not just a “feeling”. I’m not an idiot I know all of what you just said already.
