Stupid school bus is just not making it up the hill, so I signaled and started overtaking and went up the hill. I remember that truck was lousy on power, but better than a school bus, I guess.

Or so I thought.

I come abreast of this school bus on my right, and it's packed full of kids. They're all screaming and yanking on air, going nuts, trying to mess with me.

So I pulled that cord three times, three long hearty yanks.
