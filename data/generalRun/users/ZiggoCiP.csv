The10thDentist,ffy8rjc,t3_evtaf2,1580340778.0,">I remember seeing a post pointing to this direction when the subreddit

As do I: https://www.reddit.com/r/The10thDentist/comments/cq6cv2/meta_this_sub_should_be_about_professional_or/

In fact that post, along with this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/The10thDentist/comments/cqatpo/this_sub_needs_to_be_more_different_from/ - were 2 of our first gilded posts.  

Now, this sub was never about 'dentists' - well, it was brought about by the 1/10th meme that was popular in August.  Kind of *actually* where the name generated from - that and a [top comment of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cpzvbu/what_is_your_strongest_held_opinion/ewsssip/) that I plugged the sub in.

Which also allowed me to become a moderator here.  

But yeah - we could have given 'experts' a try, but sadly, very few if any really showed up.  In the beginning, we had a lot of image link posts, mainly memes.  

So I, and the rest of the mods, devised some rules to curate the content toward text posts, but also generalized it to not be exclusive to only professionals, which again, had not shown up in masse.

It's not that 1/10th dentists agree based on some concrete 'factual' grounds - it's that a professional who otherwise uses said factual grounds for their job, would otherwise be at odds if they were in the 1/10th minority.

In short - a dentist's consideration for a brand of toothpaste is *not* factual or profession based, it's based on their 'opinion', which is the point of the sub.

Now, we absolutely *welcome* people to profess a professional or expert opinion, in fact, the flair (which has never been used) is one of our first ones besides META.

So... I hope I cleared that up for ya.  The bottom line is we simply don't have 'experts' or 'professionals' posting - however I *did* mandate the inclusion of thorough and thoughtful post texts, as well as coherent post title (rule 3), so people would be forced to go a little beyond your typical shit post, or fake opinions.

But by all means, if you are an expert or professional, slap on that flair, and I'll even toss you a flair for good if you really wow us.

Basically, mammals may not 'know' why - as humans do - but there's a reason why they don't typically mate within the blood lines - their instincts push them to seek out potential mates outside their gene pool.

This happens due primarily to the fact that genetic crossing is how stronger offspring are created, as some desirable traits may not be strong in an organisms genes, or like-wise like I said inbreeding can have adverse results, specially in animals, and doubly in mammals.

The social 'stigma' of incest and inner-bloodline romances may not be wholly a human construct as you may believe it to be, but in fact an inherent biological safety mechanism to prevent inbreeding - which I should remind is best for a population's genetic strength.

videos,ffre270,t1_ffrdrz1,1580156183.0,Yeah - our states are pretty big.
videos,ffrdd81,t1_ffrd4jx,1580155747.0,"Heck yeah.  I'd love to see us catch up to Europe with our interstate railways.  You can travel from France to central Germany for like $30, and in just a couple hours - it's equal to car travel.

By contrast, the same trip, outside of like the tristate area, would take several hours, and cost damn near a plane ticket.  It's absolutely ludicrous."
The10thDentist,ffrd39b,t1_ffq6s5k,1580155576.0,"I've seen some truly ugly sentiments, and already banned one person on a tosser account.  I was no particular fan of Kobe, but his name deserves none of the negativity I see being spread around."

videos,ffrcvmw,t1_ffqcyt0,1580155446.0,"True.  I think the problem is most people already don't think of trains as 'normal' transit methods, so getting people to become use to them would be necessary."
The10thDentist,ffrcssp,t1_ffqd9uz,1580155399.0,It's a meta post.  Upvote as you deem fit (if you agree).

reclassified,ffrcf0y,t1_ffqnyhm,1580155164.0,Chapo put a halt to the Kobe hate it looks like.  It's saying a lot when even *they* agree about the community being 'too' toxic.
The10thDentist,ffrcbrp,t1_ffqtr7y,1580155110.0,Yeah I got that much from a reply from OP.
videos,ffrca2l,t1_ffqzxov,1580155081.0,"Well, not now - but in the future people will likely be more leery of helicopters.

The big issue though aren't celebrities taking public transport - it's the rest of LA that clogs up their highways.  You solve *their* problem, you solve the bigger problem."
videos,ffrc6at,t1_ffra8tz,1580155017.0,The report had the helicopter traveling at 181 mph.  I'll link you a source but you can prob find it relatively easy.  I think on this article even.
The10thDentist,ffq3g1j,t3_eukwzd,1580118307.0,Alright I'll make it an announcement.

videos,ffq05rz,t1_ffpzvwh,1580113261.0,"In this case, it seems like the pilot straight hit a hillside.

Autorotation means nothing.  When I can't see very far while driving, I drive slower.  Like 40 in a 65 if it's pretty bad.

This guy was *flying* 180mph.  In low vis.

All I'm saying is the consequences of flying are much higher.  I learned to drive safe by surviving.  That's hardly ever an option when failing in a helicopter."

videos,ffpytek,t1_ffpx2j0,1580111412.0,"I hope everyone distrusts helicopters a lot more after this.  

The consequence of failure is 100X more than with a car.  They literally drop out of the sky.

I've been in a massive car wreck.  Completely demolished the car.  I was quite literally not harmed at all."
videos,ffpy8yv,t1_ffpxd23,1580110661.0,Seriously though - trains.  NYC is a cakewalk to navigate if you know the train system.  I would never want to drive downtown again if given the option.

When I started watching Rogan years ago, every mention of Ari always had some weird baggage attached.  The past couple years have only confirmed he's getting worse too.  I feel bad for Rogan - he's such a magnet for mentally suspect friends."
JoeRogan,ffptkmw,t1_ffpjyub,1580105197.0,"Ugh, I know this type of person.  I swear it's they have that one friend that everyone mutually likes who is overly compassionate and forgiving - who in this case would be Joe."
Tierzoo,ffptdbf,t1_ffpt36u,1580104983.0,"Well that's fantastic to hear.  

Except for the logistics of any sort of cross over that is.  A man can dream though!  Their production team has been said to be crazy professional too, which makes this understandable."

Your dad should be a proud man for raising such a good kid.  Rammstein shows are *legendary*, what you think of their new single?"
