AskReddit,fe2r8nb,t1_fe2mb9y,1578841970.0,I did the same thing... I'm still mind blown that the main culprit shows no remorse and is currently a free man!! What the actual fuck.
NZMagicPlants,fdm4ot0,t3_elqda4,1578539720.0,What spores you got and what kindof seeds do you want? I have seeds and want spores :)
newzealand,fd8hyys,t1_fd8eno4,1578218536.0,"Dude, you haven't read a word I've said. Not a complaint. Not in a position to worry about Netflix costs. Was breaking down incoming vs outgoing and I'm a bit bored of repeating myself to you. Stop assuming I'm struggling, never once said that. Stop assuming shit and twisting this into some weird argument that it isn't. This was a breakdown of costs to help explain the position ALOT of nzers are finding themselves in that I was trying to help explain using my own experience. I'm starting to feel like you're just really anti-netflix and thats fine for you. I pay for it, I use it, I enjoy it and it doesn't affect my budget negatively."
newzealand,fd7tv9o,t1_fd7t0rn,1578210022.0,"Not at all. I am saying that even though I had an increase, which all could have been savings, outgoings increased more than incoming which means technically I'm paying 2% more rather than earning 11% extra. This is a direct reflection of why the system isn't working for people in harder living situations than myself, you could take away my example of netflix and add in bare necessities such as groceries and fuel and I'm assuming it would work out pretty near the same, cost of living still being more than average income."
newzealand,fd7s36e,t1_fd7rb8o,1578209223.0,"Its literally not a complaint, its an explaination for someone else that didn't understand why the economy wasn't working as per someone else's statement. I was stating a list of income vs outgoing. Congratulations on your house, it seems like it made you a real happy person."
NZTrees,fd6zmps,t1_fd6vndv,1578197676.0,Man I got that same problem! Even managed to get some seeds in from the states off msnl website
NZTrees,fd6ivd5,t1_fd6i3ge,1578191713.0,"Yeah can't blame ya. I just don't buy any if I can't find anything $350 or less. Means dry spells but usually a good deal when I do find it. Hopefully it gets legalised and that hopefully brings the prices down, or we can grow our own!"
NZTrees,fd6he15,t1_fd6hanb,1578191048.0,Thanks smile bot :)
NZTrees,fd6hags,t1_fd6fpc1,1578191004.0,"Sure is! They just put their prices up to $300 this year though :( (still a good deal) last one I bought was made up of 8 buds and was a little short at 26g but seriously, one big bad boy was 13g of that 26."
AskReddit,fd65lqm,t1_fd3ntaa,1578185852.0,"I work with majority older males and have done for the past 13years (31f) and I can tell you with absolute certainty that the men are MUCH worse gossipers than women, consistently in every job I've had. I also went to all girls schools and they were definitely THE worst gossipers then but maybe that dynamic just changes after highschool?"
newzealand,fd62i2n,t1_fd61p8g,1578184649.0,"Hmm maybe not so much of a mess because it's all so personalized but if its not personalized or the patterns have no meaning/purpose then its kindof just cultural appropriation for the sake of a cool tattoo. I personally wouldn't care as long as it all meant something as they're intended to traditionally. But if OP is at all concerned about this side of it, I'd consider finding and speaking to a ta moko tattooist and asking for a little help while keeping the gfs design :) for all I know OP is maori anyway :p"
newzealand,fd5zqy3,t3_ek4o56,1578183556.0,"Alot of those symbols and patterns represent alot of different things in a traditional ta moko such as family, land, ancestry etc. I hope when using the patterns your gf has put the same amount of effort into what each pattern means for you. Otherwise its a lovely pic :)"
microdosing,fd58g55,t1_fd57y76,1578175176.0,"Thanks for the reply man :) I've had plenty of psychoactive substances in macrodoses lol probably too many but never tried microdosing. I haven't been feeling any effects at all, but when I say at all I mean absolutely no change in how i feel or think either and I'm trying to figure out how I'm meant to know what my dosage should be for m.d because its different for everyone from what I understand?"
microdosing,fd57ykj,t1_fd572t1,1578175020.0,"Yeah I'm planning long term treatment :) I meant more as in figuring out mg-wise what my dose should be, I know its different for everyone but I have no idea what I'm looking for to find that sweet spot for myself. Although I noted yours changed over time too. What made you change the doses?"
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fd55ck6,t1_fd54muq,1578174319.0,Oh dear. I've had dogs all my life and still haven't had the time/energy for a husky lol
microdosing,fd541i9,t3_ek2iuj,1578174014.0,"Thank you for the feedback! I'm just starting my md journey and am struggling to figure out my dose. I've been taking 0.1 as a dose for the past week but haven't felt any effects whatsoever. In your opinion, how can I tell what my dose is? Should I be feeling happier? Or different than normal? I am trying to md to help with ptsd and depression"
newzealand,fd4suci,t1_fcznidy,1578170814.0,"Broken e.g I got an 11% pay increase last year! Boom! I have an income for savings now! Then... my rent was increased significantly, power and internet also increased and as a flat we have netflix which also increased. My 11% payrise now only covers the majority of my 13% cost of living increase. (I budget a bit and added up the extra I earn with the increase vs the extra costs that went up after it but didn't factor in things like fuel or food price increases or general cpi)"
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fd4mnzg,t1_fd4g2qe,1578168961.0,"Yeah as the other reply stated, no thats not how puppy training normally works. Its about developing a trusting relationship with your new pet :) you can adopt an older probably already trained dog through a shelter though"
AskReddit,fd4lsli,t3_ejvb6p,1578168756.0,"When I was younger there wasn't a difference, most of us being single or not in serious relationships. Now we're all ""grown up"" (in our 30s) everyone is in steady long term relationships, married, kids whatever so it's moved more from being individual friendships to being friends with couples. Fyi many years ago I tried having a girls night party and my male friends were fomo so they dressed in drag to come along lol it was an awesome night"
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fd44rq3,t1_fd446yu,1578164444.0,Haha you just never know and too many people get in over their heads because puppies are just damn cute. You have 2 xolos already? Now I just wanna see more cute xolo pics haha
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fd43d4x,t1_fd4254e,1578164018.0,Definitely not a good breed if you are first time dog owners. They can be very stubborn and hard to train

AskReddit,fd0utkk,t1_fd0u27f,1578124055.0,The wealth gap needs to change so that'd be a pro? I honestly hadn't even considered the monetary system though! Shit.

AskReddit,fd0pl4c,t1_fd0osqi,1578122047.0,"Yeah taxes would get weird, I'm imagining most countries would get to keep alot of their laws and possibly taxes to cover those services. Its a strange picture to imagine for sure"
weedstocks,fcye3nd,t1_fcxmq5e,1578078713.0,Did he buy it legally? A super shitty practice that used to be done here was people spraying their ditch weed with fly spray because it would leave a residue that looked similar to it having nice sticky trichromes but gave the same kindof effects you described when handling it or breathing it in. Haven't seen it done in a long while but also grew up and stopped buying weed from hobos at the city mission lol. I hope it was an allergy and not some asshole spraying his weed with poisons though :/
microdosing,fcyaeml,t1_fcy5co2,1578077098.0,"Yep good idea to try a full recreational dose and see how that affects you and an even better idea to work through this emotional stuff before that! Sounds like you are definitely trying to do this the right way :) goodluck on your journey, it won't always be easy but I hope it works out for you"
microdosing,fcy2lfz,t3_ejftek,1578073969.0,"If you're adamant on trying microdosing again I definitely recommend getting yourself some scales so you know exactly how much ""thingys"" you are taking. You may still be feeling the after effects of the 3 shrooms of you took on new years  especially if they were strong whole mushrooms. I also suggest blending your shrooms into a powder form to help keep the doses the same, shrooms can vary pretty wildly in how much psilocybin is in each of them. This is all assuming you had whole shrooms though. Or if they were caps, possibly 1g each? Which isn't a microdose. Get some scales, do some research and it sounds like you are already on a path to heal yourself. Goodluck my friend!"

povertyfinance,fctimz7,t1_fcthjdm,1577944566.0,"I grew up poor with my mother, she being a solo mum trying to raise 2 kids. She used to buy me things she couldn't afford but wanted to provide - such as instrument lessons - but after a month or so she would get drunk and abusive, tell me I wasn't good enough or something similar and take things back off me and sell them or stop the lessons etc. I'm still recovering from these traumas 20 years later. Please OP, the above advice is what I wish someone had told my mum when she was struggling. I understand everything that she did now and why but I still don't really have a relationship with her because of her actions when we were broke af. This could also be a good opportunity to teach your kids about the importance of wise money handling!"

NZTrees,fcso10q,t3_eiozvd,1577920787.0,"Customs can only confiscate paraphernalia, if you pack an unused bong in your bag, yep that's getting confiscated. Separate all the parts, post some bits back if you can even, have some not-obvious parts in your carry on and very well wrapped stuff (so it doesn't get broken) in your checked and it should get through with no issues. Done it heaps with zero issues. Just remember, if it looks like it's for drug use, they'll probably confiscate it."
newzealand,fcl3yi0,t3_ehrfod,1577739288.0,"Ok and one recipe, pork belly. Whole pork belly, stuff with apple and cranberry and roll and tie (make sure the string has been soaked in water. I personally braise this first in the green bits of leek leaves,half onions, bit of apple juice and chicken stock. Braise this at 140 for about  2- 3hrs or until the pork skin has completely softened and meat is at least partially cooked. Remove from the braising liquid, rub down in oil and salt and then throw it in a hot smoker for another hr or 2 until the skin has gone golden and crispy :)"
newzealand,fcl3hvu,t3_ehrfod,1577739000.0,"Buy quality and you'll (mostly) end up with quality, as in buy good quality meat or even homekill if you can get it. Sausages are another good one to start with cause they're also hard to wreck. Experiment with different coals and woods, wood from any fruit trees works very well. Bbq coals for fast smoking or bbq grilling and slow burning charcoal for low n slow smoking. Goodluck and enjoy!"
