facepalm,ffj5ohv,t1_ffih681,1579991037.0,Well that sounds fun.
InternalFamilySystems,ffj4vpo,t1_ffiy8sy,1579990458.0,"Thank you, it's so helpful to hear another's opinion/experience. I have a therapist, not an IFS one but since I brought IFS up she has been interested and is even going on an IFS course! I agree to start with protectors because if you don't become ""friends"" with them, they will never let you through to the exiles."
InternalFamilySystems,ffiqp1o,t1_ffhzdaz,1579980324.0,"Who is this book aimed at, is it more for therapists or clients?"
TalkTherapy,ffcodxm,t1_ffbd2i0,1579803764.0,"I recommend the book Running On Empty by Jonice Webb. She gives very useful examples of all the guises that emotional neglect can take. She also points out that rather than being a concrete thing that happened, emotional neglect is about things that didn't happen, so it's almost invisible and hard to pin point."
TalkTherapy,ff9x662,t3_esg9ev,1579723442.0,"This sort of happened to me. I can't remember now the exact topic but there was something I told my therapist I wasn't ready for. I expected her to re-raise the issue when I was more ready but she never did. Finally it dawned on me that *she was still following my instructions*. I expected her to make her own decision about when to bring it up again because I expect people to ignore and override me.

I know your situation is slightly different in that the therapist seems to have taken the decision to avoid it initially. But it could still be that your T is waiting for a sign from you that it's now an approachable subject."

ketouk,ff9vhz0,t3_esd9o1,1579722397.0,This makes sense actually. The 15% difference in cocoa solids is made up in cream solids rather than sugar.
emotionalneglect,ff9utc9,t3_es6cg0,1579721901.0,"Yes definitely. Food is the only thing that makes me feel halfway satisfied. Sometimes I binge a bit - a whole pack of biscuits or 4 doughnuts at once. Not often and I know people have far bigger binges than that, but it's not healthy at all. Mostly I just overeat the wrong things on a daily basis.

The two things I did have in abundance growing up were clean laundry and lots of food. I remember going on trips and when I got home my mum had bought lots of cake and chocolate to welcome me back. She never hugged me. Food equalled love instead."
woahdude,ff6idnz,t1_ff6ecse,1579627847.0,"Google for ""typical english street""."
depressionregimens,feso2u6,t3_eq576h,1579367298.0,"Unfortunately there's no easy way to do this. Cold turkeying Effexor is a terrible idea, you really need to taper it down. I went from 150mg to zero and it was awful. Two weeks of flu-like symptoms and then it started to improve VERY slowly. It was something like 8 weeks by the time all withdrawal symptoms completely disappeared. 

I didn't take a single day off work. How did I manage? I've no idea! I at least knew it was withdrawal symptoms and that there was nothing actually wrong with me. I find physical illness easier to deal with than depression so I just kept going. Not saying I recommend that, it was a struggle."

funny,fdnz40q,t1_fdnynme,1578595782.0,"I disagree. Being a royal is simply her job role, not who she is as a person. Being a wife and mother come first before her job. I really don't care whether or not she's likeable, that's Prince Harry's business not mine."

depressionregimens,fdi63nq,t3_ele61b,1578436387.0,"My meds affect my dreams a lot. I take 4 pills total (3 in morning, 1 at lunch) and any deviation to this causes nightmares and sometimes night sweats. I'd expect it to settle down once your body is used to the new routine.

I wonder if your withdrawal symptoms are worsened by the fluctuating venlafaxine dose? That one is notorious for having a short half life, it's best to keep it stable."
AvPD,fdhffte,t3_elegox,1578421515.0,"I just read part one and the example of taking up painting is spot on. For me, I tend to trace this back to my parents. 

For example I played a musical instrument for a couple of years at school and when I didn't want to do it anymore my mother complained that I wasn't sticking with it and what about all the money they'd spent on it and why did I start in the first place if I wasn't going to keep it up.

In hindsight as an adult, I think doing something for two years, especially as a teenager, is pretty good. 

But I still apply my mother's thinking to myself. Perhaps I should learn to cook... but I can't just try stuff out and see how it goes. No, I have to buy all the right equipment and start slicing veg like a chef and make complicated dishes and invite people round for dinner (in theory) and know everything about every single food and how to cook it and how to combine it. I have to STICK WITH IT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE OTHERWISE WHY DID I BOTHER WASTING PEOPLE'S TIME. So I don't try in the first place. 

Then I denigrate other people's ability to cook. Like who cares if you can make your own curry sauce, why not just buy one. What a waste of time and money making it all from scratch and buying the million ingredients you need. Pfff. Aren't I the smart one making my life simpler.

Yeah."
AvPD,fdgni1k,t3_ekz8v8,1578403177.0,"I find it easier when I have something specific to do. So not ""go to the mall"" but ""go to this specific store and buy this specific item"". That way you can concentrate on where you're going and looking for your item. 

Sometimes I prefer to go somewhere busy so I can disappear into the crowd, other times I prefer fewer people around, use your feelings to judge that."
