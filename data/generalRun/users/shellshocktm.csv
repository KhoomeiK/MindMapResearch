It would be a task downloading it on epic too and then comparing them both but I thought I'd ask here first before doing so."
RocketLeague,fese09e,t3_eqd9ms,1579364214.0,Bro I've been playing ~200 ping since 2017 except one or two months in 2019 when I got ~70 in some matches. Because of this I never play ranked because I just feel like I keep my teammates down by getting beat to every 50-50 and missing saves and redirects because the ball goes wonky every time someone touches it. Tried everything to fix it but nothing worked. I've accepted my fate now and play alone because I've got a crippling addiction to this game.

aww,fdjq034,t1_fdiukrj,1578482928.0,"Not a vet but in my practice with humans, the first line of investigations for a suspected bowel obstruction is an erect abdominal x-ray for checking multiple air fluid levels that are almost a sure sign, much clearer than USG too so it'd make sense to do that for animals as well. We usually choose USG over x-ray in cases of suspected trauma in a case of an acute abdomen although I'm not sure how vets initially figure out the probable cause if the history is uncertain."
aww,fdjpra8,t1_fdiqz91,1578482606.0,"Physician here. Never knew vets use x-ray to check for pregnancies. Personally, I really think it's not particularly unsafe for pregnant women because a single exposure for routine x-ray is equivalent to the radiation a person is exposed to over a period of 3 days outside and since it's not done regularly enough to cause any problems, it's not that big of a deal but I can see the reason for not doing so. Please don't take my licence away, I would never advise an x-ray for pregnant women regardless haha."

AskReddit,fdjf9bt,t1_fdj7kkp,1578468314.0,"Clearly you care enough to continue this conversation. To you, anything even remotely right of far left is like a 'Fox news host'. Talk about greatest hits. I've heard the fox news analogy more times than I can count and there's never a valid argument to back it up, you included. Here's a little bit of common sense for you. Being a conservative isn't an inherently bad thing. I don't know where it crossed the threshold to being evil but there's absolutely nothing wrong with holding liberal or conservative views and for hundreds of years they went hand in hand. What's problematic is the extremes of both ends. Hell, I'm a classical liberal but my views from even a few years ago are now considered right wing. Also, right wing has been likened to a derogatory term for some godforsaken reason, that somewhere along the line it became a bad thing to value an individual over the group they belong to. Look, I know I'm wasting my time talking to you. Neither one of us is going to convince the other about anything but I will say this. You're the kind of person making your side look bad and while I'm all for everyone speaking their mind, I hope for your sake that you let smarter people talk instead of spouting off your insults and name calling instead of actually arguing your point (which I'm certain you don't know in the first place because you're only parroting that which has been indoctrinated)."
AskReddit,fdj758o,t1_fdj1w3y,1578460346.0,"This is the exact hijacking of Reddit by intolerant aggressors like you that I'm talking about. You wish all the conservatives would leave so that you could continue that liberal circlejerk, don't you? Are you so scared of a few dissenting opinions? Can't handle the facts, more likely. I'm not going anywhere and we won't be censored by people like you so you better learn to deal with it. Also, you can't speak for everyone here. The left deals in group identity rather than individuals and you're the perfect example that just proves my point. Good day to you, sir (If that's your gender identity)"
AskReddit,fdixsj7,t1_fdhccd9,1578453477.0,"I'm a physician and oftentimes I'll be asked to source any medical knowledge and advice that I choose to provide, usually for trying to clear someone's doubts or gross misconceptions. How am I supposed to do that? It's not like they're going to go check the textbooks that I cite or go back in time to attend the lectures that I did to acquire that information. I try to cite my sources as often as I can but none of these idiots are my peers and I'm not publishing a paper so at the end of the day I don't care. I recently posted some information about sleep physiology that I picked up in a lecture from a doctor conducting research at AIIMS and I was immediately questioned by someone claiming to be a PhD student in neurophysiology (convenient), spouting off something that I read in a physiology textbook nearly a decade ago (We've done a lot more research then and new discoveries have been made). I painstakingly went through my old textbooks to cite the exact sources and then the information of the doctor I got the new info from and the supposed PhD student never replied, presumably because there was nothing left to shit on anymore. I hate Reddit."

Just let your gameplay do the talking.
worldnews,fd21krz,t3_ejv86a,1578140234.0,"These are hollow words from a man who has made billions over the years and now finally decided to grow a conscience since he's retired and he has no further need to make money. The man is 64 and can live out the rest of his life lavishly with a fraction of what he has so it's okay for him to start pointing fingers now.


Would hold a lot more meaning if he didn't take it all in the first place but I don't mind billionaires and feel like wealth earned by an individual, regardless of the amount, is rightfully theirs. He's got a lot of other billionaires to pledge their money for charitable causes after their deaths. It wouldn't have happened if he wouldn't have elevated himself to his current status to give back to the society in this way.


Also, a billion is just a number and the context of magnitude of numbers changes over time as far as currency is concerned. There have always been obscenely rich people in the past and the multi millionaires of yesteryears are the billionaires of today.


It's also nobody's business to try to tell them how much is 'enough' for a person to have. It also leads down a dark path to equity where the impoverished will turn on millionaires next deciding their comfortable ways of life are too extravagant and that it's too much for them and so on and it'll be too late for them to realise that amassed wealth was not enough for everyone to go around and now there's no incentive for innovation and competition because the investors with all the capital don't exist anymore.

There was this dude who wanted to trade so bad he'd actually give away good items for a handful of crates even if I told him it'd be a very unfair trade. He'd say oh I'll just buy more keys and probably end up with more items. Whenever I came online he'd immediate message me like bro please let's trade and the manner in which he talked reminded me of drug addicts desperately looking for a fix. I introduced him to all the trading sites I knew, taught him how the economy works any then unfriended him shortly afterwards because I'd be embarrassed if he found out the true value of the items he gave me for rare decals and crates."

AskReddit,fcy22uf,t3_ejdlbw,1578073719.0,Back in college I was gonna take my girlfriend to this festival that I got a couple of tickets for but she said she had some stuff to do and that it's okay if I go without her. Asked my best friend and he seemed to be busy too. Told them both that I'd rather not go if neither of them could make it and decided to stay at home. Got a call from an old acquaintance who had moved away a few years ago who said he's in town and at the festival so it'd be great to catch up. Lucky I have tickets so I told him I'd just meet him there directly. I go there and I see my girlfriend with my best friend. After all these years I still hate them both for not being honest.
