Providence has really gone to shit in the past decade or so. They managed to put a parking meter on every possible previously free space in the city, they have cameras all over the place just to get you for some minor bullshit like this to make a buck, and now they are putting in toll gantries with the caveat that they are only for commercial vehicles to pay, but everyone knows it's only a matter of time before they deep dick passenger vehicles too because there is no way exclusively commercial vehicles on 146 will pay for the millions the gantries cost on top of actually going towards infrastructure.

There is no reason for anyone to take their money to Rhode Island anymore when Worcester is right there with less bullshit and Boston is an actual city worth visiting. I might understand some of these passenger vehicle fees if Providence had anything to offer at all or at least they made an attempt at public transportation, but they don't. These days it's just a pile of shit south of Boston that is getting less appealing every year. It pains me to say it too because 10+ years ago it had it's charm just by virtue of being less crowded than Boston. Ever since the morons gave away $75 million to Curt Schilling it feels like the elected officials are trying to push people and their money away. It's like they want the state to fail."

A game has officially gone to shit when ""stream sniping"" even begins to become part of the discussion surrounding said game. Now Sea of Thieves has an official rule about ""stream sniping.""

A quick Google search says ~20 of the world population and ~18 percent of the US has never been on a plane a single time, which is a fairly large chunk alone, but what about people who have flown, but rarely do?

The best I could find in a quick search is a statistic for ""Frequent flyers"" in the US which are defined as people who fly more than six times a year. That is only twelve percent, leaving the other 88% probably not giving much of a shit. Hard to say how many people out there even go on a single vacation a year since it feels like people of most age groups can't afford to these days.

I'll cut to the chase after watching the video again just now.

The design is indeed shitty, but for a completely different reason than he claims in this video.

The design is solid from a thermal standpoint, it always was, the fan and heat sink do work and are there for reasons other than a ""placebo"" or Apple being stupid or something like that. The design never would have made it's way to production, never mind going out the door with unnecessary parts or a design that doesn't work in an R&D lab. The design is flawed because it was ultimately not robust enough for the average user. They wanted a product that was super thin, and this is how they achieved that result, but they failed to create a laptop that was rugged enough to last a reasonable length of time. That would be a fine point to harp on, but he absolutely did not do that.

So ultimately, Apple did fuck up, but Louis Rossmann is an annoying dope who fucking loves to hear his own voice and say outlandish things to get clicks and instead of the truth (if he was even aware of the truth at the time of this video) he said something spicy here and got a lot of views for his efforts. If he had stated the truth instead, this video likely wouldn't have the over 1.1 million views it has that exceed his subscriber count.

I should note, my initial decision to post on this thread was a result of seeing two previous videos of him either lying or being misinformed about other products and companies, but acting like he knows everything regardless.

Why doesn't he? See my three month old speculation above. Nothing adds up except the possibility that he is talking out of his ass.
