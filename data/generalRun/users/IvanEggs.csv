# FAQ

# What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

# Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

# Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

# I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

# How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right."

teenagers,fepplke,t1_fepmom6,1579327085.0,"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house
is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the
villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee
for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home
every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I
occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure
I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having
a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes
of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no
problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I
wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.
I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.
I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to
live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself
with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would
cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with
society, and I know that is what brings me happiness.
Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."
