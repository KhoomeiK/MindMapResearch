That said, raw is 0 degrees, rare is 125 (not raw), medium is 145 (also not raw), and well done is 160 (definitely not raw), regardless, the red you see is not blood, it's also not uncooked, and technically speaking your definition of raw is incorrect."
coolguides,fff2ps9,t1_ffdnesu,1579874096.0,">Have you ever ordered well done at a steakhouse?

All other things being equal, the temperature determines the texture and the flavor. When I say ""being equal"" I mean the quality of the meat. Steakhouse meat is usually a better cut than what you might get at a chicken place serving steak or something you just grabbed off any shelf at the supermarket.

Having a well done steak at a steakhouse would not result in a delicious steak *for me*.  It would still be ""over cooked"" *to me*. The tang (not sure if there is a technical term) of the meat is gone once it passes the red color, the myoglobin is gone, dried up, evaporated whatever .  It then just becomes a carrier for whatever spices and salts are on the steak.  There is no actual flavor left of the meat itself in a well done cooking, you are literally just tasting the spicing.

You like the texture, that's clear, and that is perfectly fine, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

But I like that ""tang"" and if the cut is done properly, it's trimmed properly and cooked properly, there is nothing like a medium steak *to me*.  No matter how they might prepare it, well done will always lose the flavor I find enjoyable.

>It's so mushy.

Mushy steak comes from one of three things, a fatty cut, fat not rendered or it being rare to medium rare (pulpy). I cannot stand mushy steak, it's gross (to me). You get mushy steak from minimum wage ""chefs"" who can't wait for their shift to end.

As far as trying things, I have since tried every gradient possible, medium is best for me.  Medium rare runs too close to ""mushy"". 
 Red, not pink, Red, not purple. Just RED. It's best if there is a really good sear as well.

The only time I enjoy (or tolerate) a ""well done"" piece of meat is if it's in a stir fry, because there's really no other way to do it without just waving the thin small pieces at the pan from a distance and calling it done, and all the other flavors are what's important anyway."

However... I used to be like that because my family overcooked steak my entire childhood.  One day I had a steak that was way under cooked but I was ridiculously hungry, so I sat there with my angry face, cut into the medium steak, red center and was absolutely blown away.

I can prove this by doing a simple search on Google for ""men deep voices"". The sheer contradictory volumes of information of any particular conclusion is staggering. You could get more specific, but there's no need to.

The ""studies"" vary from men deepening their voice to attract women, men who deepen their voice to ward off other men. I even found one that says exactly the opposite along with others like women like deeper voices, why women should be suspicious of men with deep voices and the list goes on.

Taken all together, it means no one has a definitive study on the vocal machinations of males or how it affects anyone they might be talking to and it certainly does NOT suggest any particular male does it without noticing.

Don't trust ""studies say"", the VAST majority of ""studies"" in the media are biased, not scientific or come from a student who needs to find something unique to graduate.

That's at odds with what you originally said by implication.

>This, this is new and new deadly disease doesn't work out well for humanity.

That statement is implying a much greater importance and implying to past major uncontrolled connections. It's the year 2020, not 1400.

You specifically said new, not ""class"" that's true, but that specificity isn't expected from someone who doesn't understand or know much about virals, you can't pretend you know what you are talking about here now. You did specifically say ""deadly"" and ""new deadly"".  Every virus is deadly, even the common cold and influenza, which this coronavirus causes along with sometimes more severe pneumonia in the susceptible. It is no more a death sentence than any of the previous mentioned.

Then there is this:

>Also the 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu killed around 203,000 people

The regular pesky ever changing and adapting flu kills over 600,000 per year. In addition, influenza of all types hits the old and young harder and the impoverished more so, the vast majority of the deaths by H1N1 reported came from third world or health care lacking areas. The vast majority of those susceptible to H1Z1 (or this new coronavirus) are also susceptible to common influenza.

You also then said:

>Yes but we know what the flu is and how to deal with it. 

And yet 80,000 people died in the US from the flu last year, up to 600k globally.  So, as long as we ""know how to deal with it"" it's no big deal I suppose?

It's not going to infect everyone, everyone infected is not going to die and it doesn't (or will not) have any higher rate of mortality in flu prepared locales.  The first guy who brought it back to the US already went home safe and sound. AND, most importantly, it is basically the flu, something we already ""know how to deal with"" because ""dealing with"" involves bed rest, fluids and staying home from work. In short it's a new strain of influenza, at least in scope.

That doesn't mean it's nothing to worry about, doesn't mean it's not a bad thing, a new strain of flu is extra unnecessary suffering and death, but it also doesn't mean you should be stockpiling bats, nails and shotguns for the zombie apocalypse or making it sound worse than it is."

That's quite ridiculous in the context you have presented it.

That said, why would/should a trans person be attracted to another trans person?  That doesn't even make sense. Trans people aren't automatically gay (or straight). Nor do they lack standard personal preferences. They are just regular people for fucks sake.  

As far as over weight people not being attracted to other over weight people, it's not hypocritical, it's not ""bad"", it's not anything but personal preference. Unless of course you consider being overweight to be a flaw and with that flaw must come acceptance and only desirable of said flaw.

Just for the record, trans people not being specifically attracted to other trans people is definitely the ""majority"". Trans is not a race, religion, color or creed, it's a designation/label, that's all, there is no other commonality.

teenagers,ff64zes,t1_ff61nae,1579619259.0,"I appreciate that, thanks.

However, I don't really see it. You cannot call something sequestered simply by existing, without whales there would be no need to sequester their bulk to begin with, that's circular logic.  In addition, whales carcasses are consumed by other species. They don't just sit at the bottom for eternity in tact.

I mean, if they *always* swam to the surface and crawled up to the beach to die and then released all that carbon, sure, but they live and die in the ocean (generally speaking) and they are part of the system, all the carbon they ""sequester"" is already there, already NOT escaping into the atmosphere.

As far as plankton, they are not wholly dependent on whales fecal matter. That they may thrive on it means little, without whales they would still exist, again, since they feed on plankton, they are releasing said minerals the plankton already posses. Closed system.

I don't see how someone (not you) can take a component (Whales) closed/circular system and claim sequestering. That just seems like save the whales justification. Which is great, I am all for that, but it's still misleading. At best whales are carbon neutral and until a study is done that specifically says plankton would die off if not for the whales, or at least die off or not procreate in numbers to offset them, my original joke has ""merit"", but only in a technical way.

2. Female with tiny but visible breasts mates and has a baby.
3. Lonely dude with evolutionary urges sees woman with tiny breasts nurse baby, her boobs get bigger as they fill with milk and baby grows healthy.
4. Lonely dude wants to do the mambo and the need to procreate (evolution) directs him toward the female that has already given birth to a healthy baby. If she's not available, he looks for boobs.

False.  You mean a false correlation.

There are hundreds of thousands of comedians and actors. There are millions of scientists and upper educators.  You find a bunch who have stated they are depressed, clinically or otherwise and not only make the connection that intelligence = depression but also that those who have spoken about it are, in fact, intelligent.  House is a fictional character.  Laurie is an Actor.  You have no basis or frame of reference, other than contrived, to claim that he or anyone else who you might be citing is more or less intelligent than anyone else around you. Scientists, professors, or anyone in a presumed intelligence gated profession or pursuit can also actually be, not so intelligent.

False correlation and that false correlation shows a lack of said intelligence, as in, a tree for a forest.

No one truly ""understands the world"" and ""understand more"" is misleading as ""more"" is not quantifiable. Successful or famous people are not necessarily more intelligent than any random person on the street.  Reading a synopsis in place of the book, and coming to a conclusion, does not make someone intelligent, it makes them less so.

There are also different forms of depression, most common being clinical or situational.  Clinical is usually a chemical imbalance, not necessarily caused by trauma etc.. the rest is all situational. Clinical can happen to anyone, of any intelligence level and has nothing to do with how they see the world or how much they understand it.  Situational depression almost always stems from a focus on oneself, not the ""world"". A traumatic event, insecurity, a breakup, job loss, no discernible future, being alone or a combination of all.

I posit the opposite ""correlation"", as it pertains to situational, I feel the more intelligent one is, the less susceptible they are to general depression (not clinical).

The more you understand how everything works around you and what it's all about, the less *situational* depressed one would be. The job loss becomes an opportunity, the break up affords introspection and growth etc. A lot of depression is based upon oneself and the insecurities of oneself. Get someone who is depressed, or claims to be depressed to talk about themselves and life in general, if you are successful in getting them to talk the reasons will become clear, they generally stem from the self, not the world around them.

*I'm shy, I am unemployed, I have no future, can't find an SO, everyone hates me, I'm weird, people think I'm weird, I don't fit in, I'm short, I'm too tall, my penis is small, my boobs are lopsided, people laugh at me etc...*  all self involved. Nothing to do with the world at large.

Truly intelligent people understand that dwelling on things one cannot control, or not controlling the things they can, can detrimental to themselves and those around them, wasteful of the precious life you've been given and instead focus on the here and now, the experiences one can have and the impact one can cause on those around them, this is in spite of intelligent people knowing and understanding that no matter what they do in 100, 200,  500 years or beyond no one will remember their name or that they existed and that life, at it's core, is truly meaningless.  That can be depressing for someone who *isn't* intelligent.  Intelligence (at least imo) is accepting it and actively doing something with your time.

Finding life depressing because you ""understand"" the world isn't a sign of intelligence, it's totally the opposite."

I find it slightly amusing/annoying when people use ""x here"" as if it is all encompassing and what they say next represents everyone and everything from wherever they hail from against another country, and it's usually followed by some really sketchy ""facts"".

Like everything else and like everywhere else, what matters is location.  Britain isn't comparable to the US in size, but it still has it's pockets of affordability. And in the US, unless you are in a big city, you're not getting 120k as a programmer.

>Here £15-20k is for your entry level office worker

[The Office of National Statistics](https://www.findcourses.co.uk/inspiration/articles/average-salary-uk-2018-14105) yearly survey showed that 
 for those in full-time work, the average UK salary is £35,423 and £12,083 for those in part-time.

Now, I do not know what ""entry-level"" pay is, but I quickly looked up a job listing for ""office"", the very first one I found was £24k and the ranges were between 17-41, with 17 being for an office assistant and not a ""programmer"", I know the UK is pretty damn good when it comes to workers, so I assume that lower rate increases quite fast over a shorter period of time where we have ""at-will"" employment and the UK doesn't. In addition, comparing an entry level job with a high level programming position (without also mentioning the competing US ""entry level"") is not only misleading, it's disingenuous.

That said, if you are living in London, £92k (which is the equivalent to US $120k) does not make you a rich fuck with a butler and a Tesla, and if you live outside of London, you're not getting £92k. That's a fact that can easily be looked at on any job listing site, the pay rates go up quite considerably in London.

Also, the standard of living in the UK is comparable to the US at least averaged out, you pay very little for health care, much more for petrol, utilities and in taxes.  NY is more expensive than London, but virtually any other major US city is less expensive (except maybe San Fran or LA).


UK salary: £92,000

Your Income Tax is £24,298.20

Your National Insurance is £5,804.16 <-- *Most people forget to mention you DO pay something for health/unemployment etc care.*

in total you pay £30,102.36 (that's a third)

Your net is: £61,897.64

Source is the UK tax calculator [here](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/) with generic selections.

My point being is that there is virtually no difference between the US and the UK when all things are comparable and considered and no one said 120k wasn't respectable. What the point of the post was some kid who hasn't put in the time, learned a throw away script and made bank.  In short, it's jealousy over not thinking of it first."

Pregnancy is a big deal, it's a big issue for the individual. That's what gets lost in the shuffle here, people on both sides of this issue look at it as a whole, but it's 100% individual.

Most unwanted pregnancies happen when a female is young, inexperienced or uninformed and they get their information and support from a multitude of sources, most of them conflicting. This would not change if it were 100% legal everywhere, without cause, in any situation, 100% free or instant, it would be the same for any young woman regardless.  Abortion is, and never will be, akin to the choice of what color skirt to wear, regardless of law, availability or public sentiment.

I see more than a few comments in here equating female perspectives (emotion, feelings)  on their choices being solely societal constructs, that's ridiculously degrading.

Abortion issues aren't simply a societal construct and men, of which you are probably one, have no frame of reference at all. Females have the unique ability to create life, men do not, we should have zero say in it, in any capacity other than support.

So, yes, studies like this do need to be done, so there is more accurate information for young women in this situation to potentially be aware of.

As far as the business, my wife called me at work one day worried about a cc charge, she was stressed.  I love my wife, she's the best thing that ever happened to me and it got to me.

So while I was still at the 9-5, I took the last 300 we had and started a side business of reselling some bulk items from China on eBay, it was kinda spontaneous, I didn't know what I was doing.  I did ""ok"" meaning what I sold covered the costs and I made pocket money.  Then I lost interest as gaming and netflix called me back (so failure one).  I resisted somewhat and looked for something else .   I found something else, similar in nature but this time involved starting a website and selling on my own.  That one lasted a year, I put effort into it but not a ton.  I made more than pocket change but again, I floundered. (Failure two)

I was still in the mindset that I should be making tons of money or it was not worth it (which isn't true) Money just doesn't fall from the sky (*until you're rich that is, then it f'in rains*)

I woke up one morning finally believing I could do this, so I searched hard, took a niche interest that I had just found out about and looked into it, turned out that the prices US places were charging were 200-250% above cost and virtually none of it was being undercut by part timers on eBay.  I know the costs because by then I had a rudimentary understanding of how China and wholesale worked and knew I could get the stuff cheap.

Light bulb time. I used my China contacts and they were happy to find this new thing to sell me and they did. I swear they are all related in some way... In fact sometimes I think they have endless factories pumping out literally everything in one place, kinda weird, but it works I guess.

I started a new website, got a small amount of product in and started hammering some like minded forums with much lower prices. I started by just telling people I had stuff cheaper and the orders came in.  Most people were skeptical, but as with everything, some people were willing to try and the savings was just too tempting.  So I provided great customer service, excellent communication and my rep grew FAST.  From there it was a few years of hard work, 18-20 hour days (promoting, packing, ordering, emailing, helping, not being a dick business owner), I quit my 9-5 and went full force.  On year 4, I had 500 orders a day and had to hire people, the money was ridiculous.

I sold it in 2019 for an absolutely silly sum and I never have to work again.

So the winning formula is: (at least for me)

1. Be serious about it and committed.
2. Understand that nothing happens overnight.
3. Find a niche product category (search Alibaba etc) and manufacturers.
4. Check pricing on Amazon, eBay and small niche stores for something that is ***at least*** 100% markup.
5. Set up a website, make it nice, not a 1990's OR too flashy as too flashy deters older people.
6. Start with one or two products in low numbers.
7. Start talking to people on the forums of that particular interest.
8. Work hard and provide the best possible customer service possible. (I have won awards for this)
9. Work so hard you're like ""I'm too old for this shit"" and then sell it to some enterprising young person who thinks they can take it to the ""next level"".
10. Retire.


ANYONE can start a business, anyone can be successful, color, creed, age does not matter. All that matters is drive and dedication. If you get a handle on 1-4, you'll have all the knowledge you need to start virtually any business.

Note: Number 3 is key though, lot's of people (millions even) buy cheap crap and sell it for a tiny profit on eBay, thinking they've ""won"". Sure, if you want to work forever and just barely get by (failure number 1)  Selling something for 1.00 profit means you have to sell thousands to make any actual money.  That's a lot of packages and time.  Try to find something that you can make at least 10.00 off of, otherwise it's going to be hard.  

OR do what I did and find a niche hobby/industry that has lots of components/items, so then you can sell up to 10 items to each customer each with a 1.00-10.00 profit each, it's keeps the cost to customer low and your profits up. An actual win-win.  I am actually credited for lowering the prices for everyone on an entire (niche) industry. The cost (to the customer) of the items I sold before I started are 50% lower today. I even got angry emails from competitors!

Tip 1:  Once you expand into more than a few products, you don't need to make 100% markup on a product that sells for $100.00, but you do need it if it sells for $1.00.  This is where some businesses make mistakes and it's how I ""won"" my industry.  My competitors were going for the 100% rule, that is, full markup on *everything*. If you sell your high ticket item for 50% less, you bring in more people for the stuff you can then sell at 100%+.

Tip 2: A new business I was going to start involved heated apparel (gloves, socks, insoles, vests, jackets etc). The market has only a few major players and their products are produced in the exact same factory, and the kicker is, it's currently 300% markup on volume (from direct manufacturers, NOT ordering from Alibaba).  Lot's of wiggle room there.  I am getting too old to be stuffing packages or dealing with people to do it for me and again, I am set now, I don't need to be ultra rich, so... look into it if you're interested, motivated and committed.   The only drawback to that market is customer retention and callback, most people only buy what they need and it's lasts so less repeat customers. But to me, becoming a major player in that market should be relatively easy. Plus you can have it all shipped to Amazon and let them do all the hard work.   *wait a minute...hmmm*

Tip 3: You can get China to make anything. Literally anything.  If you take tip 2 and run with it, you can ask for design changes, new products or specialized packaging and it costs less than you think and requires less investment than you might think, you do have to negotiate, but still.

Recently that guy from youtube in the case controversy claimed x dollars for development costs of that case he was accused of ripping off, he's full of crap, either that or he's an idiot.

All he did was point to one product say ""change this slightly"" and then he got the sample in and said run with it.

I failed twice but kept at it, I eventually got one to stick and it became a wild success with a huge load of work, which oddly enough, kept me from getting depressed, anxious or feeling down. I recently sold my business for bank, now I can game anytime, anywhere on anything with anything and I do not feel any guilt for doing so.

To each his own and everyone is certainly different, but gaming isn't a cure for your ills, it's a distraction, as soon as you put down the mouse or controller, everything is still there waiting for you. Sort your issues out and then game, it'll be (at least imo and ime) better.

Not seeing that at all. In fact you were immediately upvoted.

No one is claiming they do not exist. They just weren't here as you claimed.

Really?  So the people who would have commented didn't because they were frightened away? And you know this ... how?  I've been on reddit since the beginning, there has never been an instance where a dipshit was scared off by the masses.

So have I, again, that's irrelevant.

Then just say that. There is no need to invent a boogeyman, especially claiming they are clear and present when they are not.

You are a (or at least being a) reactionary who injects a scenario to fit your viewpoint.  If your opinions can not stand on their own, they are not strong enough."

I just scrolled through all the top level comments that are initially visible and then sorted by controversial.  There was one comment that was deleted that qualifies with what you just claimed.  All of the other comments are either neutral or positive.

I find it a bit ironic that you bemoan use of stereotyping, but created a group of people that do not exist to get a point across."
marvelstudios,fegj1x2,t1_fegcbho,1579094292.0,"Speaking (imo) for the as written character in the movie...

Thor's depression stems mostly from not making one single decision and the belief that he is/was/should have been the savior.

His entire existence has been one of privilege and power, not imagined... real. It didn't stem from a life of struggle or insecurity, dealing with weight loss or a sense of identity, lack of control, none of that. It also wasn't caused by a chemical imbalance, a seasonal disorder or any of the other actual causes of real depression.

Thor's depression was based upon a single act, not the consequences of said act, just the act itself. He was angry with losing his home and most of his people, but it was the one personal failure being the linchpin.

He should have gone for the head is the only thing going through his ""depressed"" mind and Thanos his only true regret. HE was the one to fix it. Selfish through and through.  

His compadres know who Thor is and are trying to get through to him.  In addition to that, in Endgame, while Thor was so depressed, he took shots at Star Lord who was obviously uncomfortable and insecure himself.

He still hadn't learned.

In short, you are not Thor, Thor doesn't represent you or your situation.  I assume your depression is real, Thor's was situational, they are not the same.

>Thor desperately wanted to be the one to use the glove just because he wanted to do something right.

Is a perfect example of self absorbed selfishness.

Depression and being depressed are entirely two different things. Situational depression is not the same. Everyone gets a bout of situational depression at some point, few of us are actually suffering from depression, but those who are have it much rougher than Thor."

You think you're so enlightened, don't you?

I have respect for any parent who tries their best, but recovering from a poor decision you made, while in the process being an absentee or poor father, is not, *by itself*, respect worthy, regardless of clean up or subsequent action. Those other people, the ones who went on to have a career and ALSO probably are good parents, they didn't make poor decisions, they were probably dedicated and decisive all the way through.

Lawyer = Good Dad = Some respect?

Doctor = Good Mom = Some respect?

Poor decision making deadbeat father who turns his life around and finally becomes a real parent = Most respect!

You fit the description I laid out."
