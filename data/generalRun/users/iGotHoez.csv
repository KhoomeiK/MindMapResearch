AskReddit,ffruw2k,t1_ffrtc0s,1580166371.0,"> nope. if your emotions are out of control, you aren't a man, you're a boy.

Showing your emotions in a healthy way is not automatically 'out of control'. Repressing your emotions is not the only way to treat them.

> meaning that i will judge me. because i've failed to regulate myself properly

You're almost there. Now ask yourself why do you feel like you should 'regulate yourself' just because you were born a man? Why do you judge yourself for not repressing your emotions? It's because you are a man, right? And you think that's how men should feel about themselves? Because I sure don't. 

>no, you just made that up. try reading the actual words

You literally said, and I quote: ""**it's not about being manly, it's about being a damn adult instead of a child.**"" This was in a response to the question, which states: ""... **How much does repressing your feelings affect you?**"". So no, I did not make it up. You said it yourself, clear as day.

> i don't do that. it's also something you made up 

I never said that you did any of what I mentioned before. I was saying that it is not healthy to keep you emotions in check only because people will judge you if you don't. I wasn't referring to you specifically.

> as a man, i've learned to stop automatically accepting the judgment of others.

That's exactly what I can say for myself. As a man, I do not care whether other men or women view me as immature, or weak, when I stop bottling up my emotions. Even though that is exactly what society wants you to do if you have a dick and balls between your legs."
AskReddit,ffrsvqj,t1_ffrrbae,1580165083.0,"Yes, keeping your emotions in check *to avoid appearing less manly*. Meaning, bottling your feelings up only because people will judge you if you don't. You clearly said that NOT repressing your feelings as a man makes you a child, which I don't agree with. Just as I don't think it's healthy to 'keep your emotions in check' only to avoid people judging you. I'm not saying it's ok to cry your eyes out every time you stub your toe, but bottling everything up just because you are a man isn't good either. Of course if you're naturally not into all this emotional stuff, then no one is gonna force you. But I think it's worth to ask yourself this question as a man."
AskReddit,ffrqyvi,t1_ffrq511,1580163869.0,"Well, you did say exactly that.

> it's about being a damn adult instead of a child 

Plus, showing your emotions in a healthy way, does not mean that you are ruled by them. Showing your feelings to others does not make you immature or a child, it makes you a healthy human."

iphone,ffh4urg,t3_et7xlm,1579923162.0,"So I am looking to switch over to iPhone after having a Galaxy S6 for over 4 years now. I just haven't really been satisfied with the Android OS recently, even when trying newer phones like the S10. Anyways, I have narrowed down my choices to 3 models which are within my budget:

* iPhone XR, 64GB, with AirPods\*
* iPhone 11, 64GB, with AirPods\*
* iPhone XS, 64GB

As you see, I can get the XR or 11 with AirPods thanks to a good deal that I found in my country, so that will most likely shift my final choice away from the XS. 

I would really appreciate if someone could give be some insight on which phone is the best choice out of the three, and the actual reasoning behind it. Thanks!"

And I've never been aware of a time when any of my guy friends were trying to send subtle signals to girls either. Thats just not how boys are taught to handle these things. That's the reason why everyone always says that WOMEN should stop sending signals to MEN, and not the other way around. Plus, if you're trying to send signals and the other person actually picks up on them, the probability of being labelled as a creep or a weirdo, is much much higher if you're a guy."

depression,fdpjdyr,t1_fdpcrya,1578630227.0,"I had a very similar situation recently. I was talking to this girl who had been my high school crush for multiple years. I guess you could say we were friends. She seemed genuinely interested, and by that I mean she was actually flirting. Usually this type of shit goes way over my head, but this time I was sure. She was definitely into it.

So we talked everyday for multiple hours, and I just couldn't get enough. I've never felt so strongly for anyone ever in my life. But then for whatever reason, things were slowing down. Her responses got colder and colder, and within a matter of a few days she flipped it all upside down. Suddenly all my advances were shut down.

At first I thought she was joking around, so I continued trying to talk to her for a couple days. I'm generally a lonely person, so when someone shows genuine interest in me I will make sure they know how I feel too. At the time I was also going through a rough depressive episode, and I felt like having someone to talk to helped a whole lot. I started asking how she was doing pretty frequently, cause I hated acting like everything was going fine. I understand that she doesnt owe me anything, and that she didnt need to talk to me at all if she didnt want to.. but it seemed really strange how cold she became over just a couple of days.

One day she completely snapped on me after I asked how she was doing, mentally-wise. She told me to never talk to her again, amongst other things. Yeah, it hurt a lot. She blocked me on all social media, so I was basically locked out. I blamed myself hard for a couple days, and I still do. I can't escape it. She gave me so much hope and took it all away just as fast.

Well, a few days ago I created a new instagram account just to look at her pictures after she blocked me, because I couldnt bare being disconnected from her. And that's when it all made sense. I found multiple new pictures of her with another guy. I later found out she started dating him around the time that she stopped talking to me. So obviously I must not have been good enough I guess.

Honestly I feel like a bitch for saying this, but even now, half a year later, I still check her instagram to see if she's still taken. I wanna move on, but i just cant stop holding on to that false hope.

Edit: holy shit i just dropped a long one on u.. i dont blame u if u dont read it."
