There are similarities, but I mean, that's pretty much a given with how many queens there are, no matter if they're pageant, comedy, alternate, or burlesque style. 

I honestly don't think anyone is trying to invalidate a queen by stating they look similar to another queen just because it's bound to happen at one point due to aforementioned reasonings.

They look similar here, but they're still completely different queens no matter what. That's the main point/importance."
