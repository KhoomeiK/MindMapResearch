And between me and the other commenter- I can GUARANTEE at least one of us is female. 

I applaud you on your thoughts however, as that is a very true sentiment that is often correct in many cases."

Pennsylvania,fdxr2se,t3_en6zlr,1578772074.0,"I would recommend State College- the city around Penn State. It’s like a big town condensed, with clubs, art galleries, but a very small town feel. Wonderful farmland and hiking trails around,

  The real estate and cost of living can be high, but there are also some nice apartments available for lower income families. Crime is almost non existent- but you do have the occasional drunk college kids to deal with depending on where you live.

But just outside the city limits is NOTHING"

I am, and I feel something like this I my elbows when I lift above my head.  People who are “ double- jointed” are actually hyper mobile.

The good thing is- the best cure for hyper mobility is exercise and strengthening. Just make sure to speak with a doctor and PT about this as form will be of the utmost importance."
