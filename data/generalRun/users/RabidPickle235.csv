worldnews,feulrq6,t1_fen26qv,1579387729.0,"That’s not what he said in the video. There was no indication that it was supported by Congress and reports from that time didn’t support it either. He didn’t say “we” he said “I” and it was a brag. Maybe thats what he meant, maybe the ranks closed around him. Either way it looks bad and I am not a fan of back channel deals for politicians who seem to be in that class that they tell us peasants are sooo bad. I don’t believe it represents the interest of the people no more than I believe Biden’s creepy antics are innocent. It’s not a pro trump argument....it’s a pro middle and lower class survival statement. I find the left as annoying and repugnant as I found the right during Obama’s time."

worldnews,felgjl3,t1_felfubg,1579221656.0,A prosecutor that was later proven to not be corrupt? Your doing what everyone else has done and ignored that Biden’s son worked for the company being investigated. Your ignoring that after he was removed there was suspiciously no wrong doing by the company? So son with. I experience gets a top level job at a company he knows nothing about? The investigation is into said company and it magically goes away after the withholding of aid and ousting of a “corrupt” prosecutor? Keep drinking the kool aid.

worldnews,felajsq,t1_fel9pt0,1579217668.0,"No, he was forcing the removal of a prosecutor, either overtly or inadvertently. His statements lead toward the former although a number of left leaning people argue otherwise. Even lawyers have split their remarks on it and at the very least it was a poor state,ent and a poor position to be in when you take the holier than though rout. Just because a left leaning government signed off on it is no ,ore definitive than what is faced now between the senate and the house. Both sides stacked against the other. One votes one way the other votes the other. Praising millionaires for making millionaire decisions and then barking about different millionaires getting the upper hand currently is hypocritical at best. Both sides have tie hands dirty and the lip service does nothing for me. Understand?"

People with children pay relatively the same when it comes to property or sales tax but most of the higher property and sales taxes go to schools, roads, and services that families use more of. My house taxes get raised because all the schools need more money but I have no children to send to school so why would I be obligated to pay for other people’s kids? Especially with the drop out rate and crappy parenting/kids that seem to be running around today. I know families with eic aren’t raking in the money for as much as it costs all year long to raise kids but families gets 3-5k back and I pay 1k plus every year?
