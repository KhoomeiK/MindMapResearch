interestingasfuck,ffblt2o,t1_ffbjvm7,1579771649.0,"Yes, because Iran fuels a regime of terror around the middle east by funding militia groups which are technically isolated but functionally do whatever Iran tell them to. We're not talking shooting down drones, we're talking bombings, mass terror etc. That's why previous attacks, which if direct would be considered an act of war, have been allowed to pass. If Iran do not spend more than the US on proxy terrorism, which thdy almost certainly do, they definitely spend more proportionally. 

This is also why the drone strike against Suleimani was a good thing; it showed that pretenses were to be dropped, and Iranian funded militia actions would be considered actions by Iran militarily. Iran pretended to be striking back to save face, but nobody died but for a civilian plane by accident which Iran could have no reason for wanting to shoot down. 

Also, the militias are mostly not Iraqis, Iraq is being invaded by Iran just as much as they're being invaded by the US. And Iran has a far more brutal regime, with less healthcare and education in mind than were the US backed regimes in charge. While the war in Iraq was undoubtedly a bad call, these people are religious fundamentalists. Not everything is about the US, though that will be the reason they give, because they will say anything that makes them look more credible. Hence why they also lied through their teeth about shooting down that civilian plane until it became blatantly obvious it was them."

One big way of maintaining control over follows is a ""love bomb"", you take an abandoned, familyless and socially isolated person and you hug them, you show them absolute unconditional adoration among you and all your followers, you tell them they're home and they always belonged here and they're a part of our group to a tee 

Then you introduce conditions, you tell them they're to steal a car, and if they refuse? You isolate them, they're a non believer and an outsider and aren't committed or part of the group. You remove the love they now rely on. 

Using that tactic to get inside a follower's head and tell them their old friends and family, their only other support options, are sinners to be burned is only a logical conclusion.

interestingasfuck,fesfdh6,t1_ferb12s,1579364561.0,"Well I think you and I share different views of approach, but I would be interested to hear your reasoning.

I agree in a perfect world the US would repair their relationship with Iran, which is what the JCPOA was. But that world doesnt exist. Even with the JCPOA Iranian Parliament would chant death to America fairly regularly. At this point, wishing America's violent destruction has become Iranian political bread and butter. I frankly dont think that relationship can be fixed, even by throwing yachtloads of money at them, and I also don't think there's anything that will make Iran willingly stop supporting terrorism throughout the world. 

So my view is, the world isn't perfect, so we do what works. What works? Well, Iran is a violent and aggressive country but it operates almost entirely through proxy militia groups and terrorism. War would be disastrous for them, they simply cannot afford it and they aren't good enough at it to succeed. But it wouldn't be good for their people either, so all the US has to do is prove that they are capable of, are willing to, and will escalate action against Iran to keep them from operating too openly or too ambitiously.

But it isn't like Iranian dictators really care about their people, or often the soldiers they send into conflict, which is why the US struck right at the head of the snake. To prove to those that make the decisions that they will feel the consequences of them as well. 

If they develop and use nukes, they die too. Entirely. That's the point of nukes, they're so powerful you either dont have to use them, or you can't; mutually assured destruction. 

So in essence, you can't make friends with a terrorist dictatorship but you can certainly make them fear you. When the JCPOA ended, Iran chanted 'death to America'; when Suleimani was killed, they destroyed a US base but informed them first to avoid any casualties. There was no reason for Iran to do that but fear of American reprisal, and that's the basis of the only strategies which seem to work with Iran. It's not ideal, but it's necessary."

interestingasfuck,fer9l89,t1_fer3dwo,1579351431.0,"The problem isn't underground military nuke building, but the ability to swiftly convert civilian nuclear sites into military ones. The IAEA exists to try to detect that happening, but they can't detect preparation for it happening. But you're right in that they probably haven't begun actively developing the nukes yet or converting the sites into military labs

That being said there are problems with the IAEA, that being they never got access to some pretty key military sites (e.g. Parchin). Iran have also broken many parts of the JCPOA outside of directly building nukes (launching ballistic missiles, research/development of centrifuges etc), and the IAEA themselves have admitted that they didnt want to acknowledge their inability to get access to military sites because they were afraid Trump would abandon the deal - I.e. they allowed political motivation to interfere with their trustworthiness. 

That aside, I oppose the deal out of the sheer politics. Paying off enemies only strengthens them, and encourages them to keep acting scary so their payout might increase. Iran never ceased to be aggressive/threatening in other ways, the US simply began paying for it. 

Anyway, I just did a quick google and as of Nov 2019 the IAEA just found uranium particles in a location in Iran not listed as a nuclear site, in an area Netenyahu had warned was a secret nuclear storehouse. So perhaps Iran wasn't to be trusted after all lmao"

I'm a Brit, and a centrist, but I for one absolutely cannot understand why Obama signed onto the Iran Nuclear Deal. It was never a reason not to build nukes, it was a reason to keep nuke development under the radar whilst funding Iran and their often terrorist pursuits and support.

Iran keeps acting aggressively to the US, in ways that are increasingly becoming similar to initial acts of war. The US wouldn't want to put boots on the ground, but I simply cannot understand why Americans are so blind to the reasons the US have to use physical aggression as deterrents.

But too many of these checklist points seem to be your interpretation, attempting to fit vague aspects of TRP thinking into the test. That isn't how the test was designed to, or should be, operated. 

Take for example your first few points. 

>glib and superficial charm

>This one is fairly obvious. TRP teaches one that women are like children, and then attempt to get them in bed. Their frequent complaints about women inherently suggest any attempt at wooing them is glib and superficial.

Your argument seems to be that women are viewed poorly, and so any charm is betrayed by an underlying misogyny, making that charm glib and superficial. And you're not wrong, to an extent. 

But that standard is super low, and a compliment or attempt at charming a woman may be sincere even when held alongside misogynistic views. They dont necessarily invalidate one another, and the test is designed with confirmed behaviour in mind, it shouldn't be used when simply  interpreting the intentions behind behaviour.

>grandiose (exaggeratedly high) estimation of self

>Many posts encourage the man to think they ""are a prize,"" which is a significant step up from merely thinking ""I am allowed to have standards."" 

That doesnt constitute ""grandiose"", that's just having a high self esteem. You can see that in almost all dating advice given to women as well. It's generally  good advice, too. 

>  need for stimulation

>TRP preaches the opposite of contentment in one's sexual life. A normal man would be fine without a harem.

TRP aims to teach how to achieve a sexual life, not necessarily the opposite of contentment. It doesnt seem to achieve a harem, at best a slew of one night stands. The men at TRP are already not content  with their sexual life, that's why they're on TRP. And to confuse that with a ""need for stimulation"" very much exemplifies the way you're trying to interpret what you see in TRP to fit into the boxes given. 


>  pathological lying

>TRP encourages lying or implied lies to better oneself through tactics to achieve dread. I've heard the tell of one Redpiller buying women's socks and laying them around his apartment to create the illusion a girl was there the night before. Not to mention the obviously false field reports.

That isnt even close to pathological lying, and you'd know that if you had googled ""what is pathological lying"" before writing your argument. False field reports may come closer to pathological lying, but that implies those few TRPers who do that are closer to pathological liars, but that doesnt necessarily imply ASPD or that TRP encourages that. 

Essentially you're making a very wide argument with very low standards to interpret, whether right or wrong, TRP arguments into a very specific psychological term with little prior knowledge of psychology or how the terms or test should be used. Armchair psychology never goes well, I would discourage it."

I think that the OP in the screenshot is misdiagnosing the problem. Literary analysis has been a great tool to analyse and solve problems in the real world for literal centuries. The Arts have long been considered some of the most important educational tools in the western world. 

Literary analysis has a few maxims sometimes used to guide students; 'Death of the author', for example. I believe these maxims have been adapted by politically motivated professors and teachers and that's resulted in 'fragile' students. 

Take the example earlier: ""Death of the author"". You may look at literature in historical context, and it provides a solid insight into the piece. But you might simultaneously take the stance of the uninitiated audience member, with no knowledge of the author or the book. You might then analyse the piece from an otherwise unbiased or directionless approach. 

This has now been influenced by the postmodern tendency to deconstruct. Now, literature students (including me, when I had to take part in these courses) can divorce a book from its historical context and then approach it with a specific ""lens"", forcing it into, and arguing it fits a specific narrative. 

Now, because literary themes are incredibly varied and most novels good enough to be studied follow at least a few themes or narratives or story types, almost any novel can be made to fit any narrative. If it doesnt, simply divorce sections from the novel; take a singular chapter at the bottom of a characters arc of social status, and it fits the socialist narrative, regardless of whether he becomes an idealised wealthy hero at the end.

Now, what happens when student who are taught by left wing, and often marxist professors are given the intellectual tools to do this? That's right, every novel can be considered a socialist tool, or a political tool, or are arguing for whatever they happen to believe in. Any novels which can strongly be interpreted to be against their narrative does the opposite; and they absolutely dont like that. 

I think mainly the issue revolves around the postmodernism that runs as a process throughout literary analysis now, historical context is just too far divorced from the works we study. When I studied, the only time historical context was specifically taught or mentioned was in a module designed for it. It was barely encouraged by professors at all. But it isn't all bad, depending on how universities change this could just as easily revert back to how it was. But it certainly casts a pall upon most literature students employment prospects, the entire field is a little bit tarred now. 

I realise I've gone on for too long now; this is what happens when you get literature students involved lmao"

MensLib,fce7phb,t1_fce4fgi,1577617731.0,"The interpretation of mockery or ridicule on behalf of the artist doesnt necessarily come directly from the femininity of the pose, moreso from the juxtaposition of the theme of the subject (in this case, a super macho warrior folk hero) with the theme of the picture (a sexualised, feminine man posing on a horse with an erection). That may be subject to historical fact- if, for example, Zapata were a queer or feminine man, I would say the artist has a more serious point to be making (in my interpretation, obviously), but I can't see much more than that without knowing more about the background of the piece. 

I would certainly be interested in the intention of the artist, but certainly I can see why people are outraged beyond misogyny and homophobia.

news,fc8gm6j,t1_fc5xf48,1577534471.0,"Well I am a recent Law student, my dissertation was on the failing right to free speech in the EU and UK. 

In the EU (which includes in the UK) the Human Rights Act has been changed to include a right not to be offended, stemming from a German right to (in an awkward translation of a German philosophical concept) ones own ""self"" or ""personalkty"". The result is that an offensive action can now be made illegal. I'll leave the case law since going through would take entirely too long. 

The issue with that is that what constitutes ""offensive"" is subjective on the part of the victim. So what I say may be fine to most people, and may be fine to me, but without need for intention to offend if the victim is offended I've broken the law. 

Combine that with the 2003 Communcations Acts - a piece of failed legislation drawn up before the internet became what it is now, which now has such a huge berth as to be an oppressive force in the UK, and you have a problem. Literally anything you find offensive online is illegal. Not what is meant to be offensive, but what you FIND offensive. Yet because of the prior classification of the right not to be offended as a human right, so far, no challenge to this exists. 

It has led to cases such as a young girl being charged with a hate crime for posting rap lyrics on her online bio in tribute of a dead friend (the lyrics included the N word) 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/uk-england-merseyside-43816921

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.express.co.uk/news/world/1036685/european-court-human-rights-religion-insult-crime-islam/amp

The resulting interlinked legislation means that in the UK, until we disentangle our legislation from the EU convention on human rights, disparagement of religion is illegal, causing offense to anybody in any way at all is illegal and open  to the victims 'thin skull' interpretation of offense, and though the Communcations Act 2003 only refers to online and over the phone communications of any kind, police forces (especially in London) have been known to arrest those who make such speeches in public, even if no charges can be made."

If Iran do not spend more than the US on proxy terrorism, which thdy almost certainly do, they definitely spend more proportionally. 

This is also why the drone strike against Suleimani was a good thing; it showed that pretenses were to be dropped, and Iranian funded militia actions would be considered actions by Iran militarily. Iran pretended to be striking back to save face, but nobody died but for a civilian plane by accident which Iran could have no reason for wanting to shoot down. 

Also, the militias are mostly not Iraqis, Iraq is being invaded by Iran just as much as they're being invaded by the US.

interestingasfuck,fesfdh6,t1_ferb12s,1579364561.0,"Well I think you and I share different views of approach, but I would be interested to hear your reasoning.

I agree in a perfect world the US would repair their relationship with Iran, which is what the JCPOA was. But that world doesnt exist. Even with the JCPOA Iranian Parliament would chant death to America fairly regularly. At this point, wishing America's violent destruction has become Iranian political bread and butter. I frankly dont think that relationship can be fixed, even by throwing yachtloads of money at them, and I also don't think there's anything that will make Iran willingly stop supporting terrorism throughout the world. 

So my view is, the world isn't perfect, so we do what works. What works? Well, Iran is a violent and aggressive country but it operates almost entirely through proxy militia groups and terrorism. War would be disastrous for them, they simply cannot afford it and they aren't good enough at it to succeed. But it wouldn't be good for their people either, so all the US has to do is prove that they are capable of, are willing to, and will escalate action against Iran to keep them from operating too openly or too ambitiously.

But it isn't like Iranian dictators really care about their people, or often the soldiers they send into conflict, which is why the US struck right at the head of the snake. To prove to those that make the decisions that they will feel the consequences of them as well. 

If they develop and use nukes, they die too. Entirely. That's the point of nukes, they're so powerful you either dont have to use them, or you can't; mutually assured destruction. 

So in essence, you can't make friends with a terrorist dictatorship but you can certainly make them fear you. When the JCPOA ended, Iran chanted 'death to America'; when Suleimani was killed, they destroyed a US base but informed them first to avoid any casualties. There was no reason for Iran to do that but fear of American reprisal, and that's the basis of the only strategies which seem to work with Iran. It's not ideal, but it's necessary."

But you're right in that they probably haven't begun actively developing the nukes yet or converting the sites into military labs

That being said there are problems with the IAEA, that being they never got access to some pretty key military sites (e.g. Parchin). Iran have also broken many parts of the JCPOA outside of directly building nukes (launching ballistic missiles, research/development of centrifuges etc), and the IAEA themselves have admitted that they didnt want to acknowledge their inability to get access to military sites because they were afraid Trump would abandon the deal - I.e. they allowed political motivation to interfere with their trustworthiness. 

That aside, I oppose the deal out of the sheer politics. Paying off enemies only strengthens them, and encourages them to keep acting scary so their payout might increase. Iran never ceased to be aggressive/threatening in other ways, the US simply began paying for it. 

Anyway, I just did a quick google and as of Nov 2019 the IAEA just found uranium particles in a location in Iran not listed as a nuclear site, in an area Netenyahu had warned was a secret nuclear storehouse. So perhaps Iran wasn't to be trusted after all lmao"

I'm a Brit, and a centrist, but I for one absolutely cannot understand why Obama signed onto the Iran Nuclear Deal. It was never a reason not to build nukes, it was a reason to keep nuke development under the radar whilst funding Iran and their often terrorist pursuits and support.

Iran keeps acting aggressively to the US, in ways that are increasingly becoming similar to initial acts of war. The US wouldn't want to put boots on the ground, but I simply cannot understand why Americans are so blind to the reasons the US have to use physical aggression as deterrents.

But too many of these checklist points seem to be your interpretation, attempting to fit vague aspects of TRP thinking into the test. That isn't how the test was designed to, or should be, operated. 

Take for example your first few points. 

>glib and superficial charm

>This one is fairly obvious. TRP teaches one that women are like children, and then attempt to get them in bed. Their frequent complaints about women inherently suggest any attempt at wooing them is glib and superficial.

Your argument seems to be that women are viewed poorly, and so any charm is betrayed by an underlying misogyny, making that charm glib and superficial. And you're not wrong, to an extent. 

But that standard is super low, and a compliment or attempt at charming a woman may be sincere even when held alongside misogynistic views. They dont necessarily invalidate one another, and the test is designed with confirmed behaviour in mind, it shouldn't be used when simply  interpreting the intentions behind behaviour.

>grandiose (exaggeratedly high) estimation of self

>Many posts encourage the man to think they ""are a prize,"" which is a significant step up from merely thinking ""I am allowed to have standards."" 

That doesnt constitute ""grandiose"", that's just having a high self esteem. You can see that in almost all dating advice given to women as well. It's generally  good advice, too. 

>Â  need for stimulation

>TRP preaches the opposite of contentment in one's sexual life. A normal man would be fine without a harem.

TRP aims to teach how to achieve a sexual life, not necessarily the opposite of contentment. It doesnt seem to achieve a harem, at best a slew of one night stands. The men at TRP are already not content  with their sexual life, that's why they're on TRP. And to confuse that with a ""need for stimulation"" very much exemplifies the way you're trying to interpret what you see in TRP to fit into the boxes given. 


>Â  pathological lying

>TRP encourages lying or implied lies to better oneself through tactics to achieve dread. I've heard the tell of one Redpiller buying women's socks and laying them around his apartment to create the illusion a girl was there the night before. Not to mention the obviously false field reports.

That isnt even close to pathological lying, and you'd know that if you had googled ""what is pathological lying"" before writing your argument. False field reports may come closer to pathological lying, but that implies those few TRPers who do that are closer to pathological liars, but that doesnt necessarily imply ASPD or that TRP encourages that. 

Essentially you're making a very wide argument with very low standards to interpret, whether right or wrong, TRP arguments into a very specific psychological term with little prior knowledge of psychology or how the terms or test should be used. Armchair psychology never goes well, I would discourage it."

TumblrInAction,fceuxgz,t3_eh4317,1577623956.0,"I'm an English Lit graduate with a big interest in politics and how other people reach their opinions, so this is absolutely my jam. 

I think that the OP in the screenshot is misdiagnosing the problem. Literary analysis has been a great tool to analyse and solve problems in the real world for literal centuries. The Arts have long been considered some of the most important educational tools in the western world. 

Literary analysis has a few maxims sometimes used to guide students; 'Death of the author', for example. I believe these maxims have been adapted by politically motivated professors and teachers and that's resulted in 'fragile' students. 

Take the example earlier: ""Death of the author"". You may look at literature in historical context, and it provides a solid insight into the piece. But you might simultaneously take the stance of the uninitiated audience member, with no knowledge of the author or the book. You might then analyse the piece from an otherwise unbiased or directionless approach. 

This has now been influenced by the postmodern tendency to deconstruct. Now, literature students (including me, when I had to take part in these courses) can divorce a book from its historical context and then approach it with a specific ""lens"", forcing it into, and arguing it fits a specific narrative. 

Now, because literary themes are incredibly varied and most novels good enough to be studied follow at least a few themes or narratives or story types, almost any novel can be made to fit any narrative. If it doesnt, simply divorce sections from the novel; take a singular chapter at the bottom of a characters arc of social status, and it fits the socialist narrative, regardless of whether he becomes an idealised wealthy hero at the end.

Now, what happens when student who are taught by left wing, and often marxist professors are given the intellectual tools to do this? That's right, every novel can be considered a socialist tool, or a political tool, or are arguing for whatever they happen to believe in. Any novels which can strongly be interpreted to be against their narrative does the opposite; and they absolutely dont like that. 

I think mainly the issue revolves around the postmodernism that runs as a process throughout literary analysis now, historical context is just too far divorced from the works we study. When I studied, the only time historical context was specifically taught or mentioned was in a module designed for it. It was barely encouraged by professors at all. But it isn't all bad, depending on how universities change this could just as easily revert back to how it was. But it certainly casts a pall upon most literature students employment prospects, the entire field is a little bit tarred now. 

I realise I've gone on for too long now; this is what happens when you get literature students involved lmao"

MensLib,fce7phb,t1_fce4fgi,1577617731.0,"The interpretation of mockery or ridicule on behalf of the artist doesnt necessarily come directly from the femininity of the pose, moreso from the juxtaposition of the theme of the subject (in this case, a super macho warrior folk hero) with the theme of the picture (a sexualised, feminine man posing on a horse with an erection). That may be subject to historical fact- if, for example, Zapata were a queer or feminine man, I would say the artist has a more serious point to be making (in my interpretation, obviously), but I can't see much more than that without knowing more about the background of the piece. 

I would certainly be interested in the intention of the artist, but certainly I can see why people are outraged beyond misogyny and homophobia. At least, if an artist made such a sexualised feminine portrayal of any other male 'folk hero' types anywhere else I could see it being taken rather badly by the public (thinking of Churchill, Nelson, MLK, Mandela, Gandi etc.)"

news,fc8gm6j,t1_fc5xf48,1577534471.0,"Well I am a recent Law student, my dissertation was on the failing right to free speech in the EU and UK. 

In the EU (which includes in the UK) the Human Rights Act has been changed to include a right not to be offended, stemming from a German right to (in an awkward translation of a German philosophical concept) ones own ""self"" or ""personalkty"". The result is that an offensive action can now be made illegal. I'll leave the case law since going through would take entirely too long. 

The issue with that is that what constitutes ""offensive"" is subjective on the part of the victim. So what I say may be fine to most people, and may be fine to me, but without need for intention to offend if the victim is offended I've broken the law. 

Combine that with the 2003 Communcations Acts - a piece of failed legislation drawn up before the internet became what it is now, which now has such a huge berth as to be an oppressive force in the UK, and you have a problem. Literally anything you find offensive online is illegal. Not what is meant to be offensive, but what you FIND offensive. Yet because of the prior classification of the right not to be offended as a human right, so far, no challenge to this exists. 

It has led to cases such as a young girl being charged with a hate crime for posting rap lyrics on her online bio in tribute of a dead friend (the lyrics included the N word) 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/uk-england-merseyside-43816921

Meanwhile the European court has also stated that it is illegal to 'disparage religious doctrines' even  with fact, such as the idea that Mohammed is a pedophile (one of his wives was a child)

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.express.co.uk/news/world/1036685/european-court-human-rights-religion-insult-crime-islam/amp

The resulting interlinked legislation means that in the UK, until we disentangle our legislation from the EU convention on human rights, disparagement of religion is illegal, causing offense to anybody in any way at all is illegal and open  to the victims 'thin skull' interpretation of offense, and though the Communcations Act 2003 only refers to online and over the phone communications of any kind, police forces (especially in London) have been known to arrest those who make such speeches in public, even if no charges can be made."

PurplePillDebate,fc2ze3g,t3_efwqgx,1577377948.0,"If I had to put my finger on the point at which I disagree, I would say there are 2 things:

1.) You believe that men (en masse, as we're talking about society) view women as 'property'  and that they only care about the women in their own lives as they are 'their property'. 

I'm not sure where this idea comes from, but in group bias is a very widely accepted thing. Of course men prefer women in their in group to women from an out group, but that has nothing to do with their being female. 

Secondly, women have been treated as property in some places, but assuming you're referring to western society, the last time women were truly considered property, legally speaking, was closer to the middle ages than to now. To assume these ideas are in any way active bases on historicity makes no sense; women have full human rights. Specific human rights were withheld to women during patriarchal times, but by the late 1800s women had full property rights in the US, sooner still in the UK. 

2.) You believe that men only care about protecting 'their own' property, I.e. the women in their lives, as oppose to any others. 

Id argue men do care about women who aren't in their lives. That's what police forces and laws against rape and sexual assault were largely implemented for (later being amended to include Male victims too). In cavemen days, sure, women were war prizes and men would kidnap and rape to their hearts' extents; theoretically this was one of the many reasons the state was founded. To defend the people of the state, to increase effectiveness in the state's war pursuits. 

As much as some complain of a 'rape culture', rape is illegal regardless of whether the woman was married, engaged, in a relationship or single. It is one of the most morally disgusting crimes one can be accused or found guilty of. 

That some men rape is undeniable. That if these men weren't outcasts before that rape, they will be afterwards, is also pretty undeniable. 

3.) Lastly as a final note, the argument that most men would rape if they could do so is at least less wrong than the prior two, but it's somewhat more interestingly tied to what your definition of 'honour' is. War rape has been documented in other wartorn parts of the world; across Africa, and in the Middle East, where men are (generally speaking) less educated and/or less civil. 

Would a European or American man's moral education, the knowledge that women are horrifically hurt by rape and that it is morally wrong, count as honour? Would knowledge that if he raped, he would likely lose everything, go to jail, become near unemployable, count as honour? 

I would argue no. I'd say men, in a pure, uneducated, uncivilized form would be more inclined to rape. But we knew that from prior discussed knowledge of tribal warfare in antiquity. They knew nothing of women, more truly considered them property, and so apparently felt more justified in brutal acts. Not so much today. Today, I'd argue men are aware of women as conscious human beings, and morally care about them to the degree one cares about anybody they know exists but does not know. 

In the end, it boils down to a hypothetical question posed to a hypothetical western man: ""Should a woman you will never know or meet living 250 miles away be raped?""

I think youd be hard pressed to find a ""yes"", or even an ""I don't care"". 

TL;DR: Honour could have something, but not everything, to do with western men's knowledge that women are conscious beings with human rights, and it is this which prompts them to protect women from sexual (or other kinds of) violence."
