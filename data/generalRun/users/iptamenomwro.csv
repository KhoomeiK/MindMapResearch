Will I pay cruises for them or some expensive condo in the suburbs if I can't put food on the table for my children, no! If I have spare money, sure!"
todayilearned,ffc74o2,t1_ffc5xk8,1579793079.0,"I agree with what you are saying, my point was that the food in itself, in good condition -maybe I should have clarified this, you were right to point these things out- didn't inherently taste worse than it does today, in fact it was the opposite!"

todayilearned,ffc59s2,t1_ffc4050,1579791845.0,"What you said is just factually incorrect. Peasants sailed the world to find spices? No, the nobility did. Peasants ate just fine, as long as they had food, the taste wasn't the problem, obtaining it and not dying from the plague was. People didn't eat rotten meat, they rarely even ate meat, animals are worth a lot more alive than dead and if they butchered an animal most of the meat was dry cured with salt or smoked."

Pezzetta's career isn't worth anybody's legs and this kid shouldn't miss games or have his career end just because he didn't hold his head up.

todayilearned,ffbonyv,t1_ffb6t8j,1579776001.0,"This is a huge misconception, for example, if you were to eat a tomato from even 50 years ago, your jaw would drop! Now, everything is laced with sugar and fat to make it tasty... Things used to taste fantastic right off the ground, we made sure of it through selective breeding, over generations, for thousands of years. For meat, it's even worse than with vegetables and fruit, with industrial farming and the mistreatment, vaccination and inadequate nutrition, the animals as a result, have their meat be almost completely tasteless. If you ever get the opportunnity to raise and butcher your own livestock you will see that ribs don't need gravy, they blow your mind, just with a pinch of salt. Same, if you get the opportunnity to find and plant heirloom seeds and harvest them, the results will blow your mind. The view that everything was dirty and the people miserable, eating shit all the time, is Hollywood propaganda."
