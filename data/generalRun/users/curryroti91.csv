There is a militarization movement in Japan as we speak. Part of the reason is because Japan will not formerly nor as a country repent what they did in WWII like Germany. They do not as a country regret what they did unlike the Germans.

I see a lot of comments trying to educate you on the above but you won’t listen or open your mind against your preconceived biases."
AskReddit,fez81m0,t1_fez37qa,1579454655.0,"That’s not true. Only four European countries still have a wealth tax with mixed results. Sweden axed its wealth tax as it didn’t work. the rich just relocated. Multibilllionaires just left the country.

You might be confusing a wealth tax with income tax which the very rich would not have to pay as people like Bezos are not paid high incomes."

You said someone 25-50 is middle aged but no one calls a 25 yo or a 34yo like yourself ‘middle aged’."
worldnews,fdbfr3e,t1_fdast4a,1578256945.0,"> It's not like having a nuclear weapons program is the same as being a global nuclear power. Even if Iran had nukes, they would have no effective way to deliver them to them to the US and the US and its allies would likely do whatever was necessary to prevent the country from presenting that kind of threat.

Did you forget about North Korea? They went from no nukes to ICBMs pretty quickly."

One that’s not talked about on here but is on par with broken coast is Cove Reserve. Note you gotta get the reserve stuff which is priced a bit under broken coast. The regular cove stuff isn’t good."

aww,fca2v6z,t1_fc9yq6k,1577562271.0,"Evolution works in a very straightforward way. If a trait helps a species survive, it gets passed on. If a trait strong negatively impacts a species’ survival (think birth defect), it will get eliminated immediately. However a neutral trait, one that doesn’t strongly impact survival, tends to get passed on as there is no evolutionary pressure to eliminate this trait.

The desire for parent to care for offspring is one of the main reasons why mammals are so successful. So this trait is passed on. The fact that it’s emotionally painful to have your young taken from you doesn’t impact your survival chances as there’s no selection pressure whatsoever. Even humans, 10,000 years ago, probably had lots of emotional turmoil due to miscarriages, famines, etc, but evolution doesn’t care how you feel. Our trait - we feel bad when those around us die is a huge human and mammalian advantage.

As a hypothetical, if cows suddenly started committing suicide due to the anguish then this would become a negative trait."
aww,fca0pt4,t1_fc9sb9a,1577561092.0,Just a note that most male calves usually become veal. They are not fed as much as possible to sell as beef. Dairy cows are genetically different from the beef we eat (typically Angus). That is to say that the beef that is sold in the supermarkets (at least in North America) are not dairy cows or their male calves.
aww,fc9zadk,t1_fc9umte,1577560441.0,"I think what OP is arguing is the fact that by nature, dairy cows need to be constantly inseminated, give birth and then separated from their calf. It’s well documented that this is stressful for both calf and mother cow. Both calf and cow have a deep evolutionary, biological, desire to be together. 

For those that might not know, dairy cows only produce milk for a short time after pregnancy and birth. Once the udders dry up the cycle restarts until they cannot produce calves anymore. Then they’re slaughtered and made into dog food. Not exactly a great life but it’s the life all the billions of livestock endure."
aww,fc9ye1k,t1_fc9upog,1577560058.0,"I don’t know why you’re being downvoted but it’s true. The mother cow has her calf taken away from her shortly after birth and the cow and calf suffer a lot due to this. Female calves become future dairy cows and male calves are chained up to reduce movement (to keep the meat tender) and then sold as veal. As mammals, both calf and cow have a deep evolutionary, biological, desire to be together. A dairy cow’s life is incredibly cruel and they are not any less intelligent or have less emotional capacity than dogs.

And for the record I’m not vegan or anything. I eat my fair share of dairy products but I’m not going to distort the truth and argue cows don’t suffer."
