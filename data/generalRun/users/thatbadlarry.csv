There’s a lot of “treat yo’self” in our culture today but true self care is much deeper and quite often- more basic and tangible. Like you said, eating your fruits and veggies and getting regular exercise! 
I find, if anything, weed inhibits self care. Exercise? Nah I’m on the couch I’m good. Healthy food? No way we have the munchies. Connecting with loved ones? I’m too high for that right now. Hygiene? I’ll do it later. Healthy sleep schedule? But there’s a new season of whatever on Netflix. 
When you’re clear and sober it’s much to realize, acknowledge and meet your own needs. It’s a beautiful thing. :)
Edited to add: I thanked the husband and told him that his statement was powerful and people on leaves appreciate it and he was so happy and pleased."
BackwoodsCreepy,fgspcz2,t1_fgs6rg7,1581089778.0,"I think a healthy dose of skepticism is, well, healthy. I do believe in the paranormal and cryptids but it’s important to use common sense and rule out mundane explanations. I’m not offended if people don’t believe my story - I think it’s actually a fair response! I’ve looked into all the possible bird calls suggested in this thread and none of them are quite right which is honestly disappointing. 

The idea of a corvid making that sound would set my mind at ease and let me enjoy my hobby without as much fear.
I used to be a 200 kilometres a week cyclist and now I’m at about 70-90 most weeks cause I’m just too afraid to go further. That really sucks cause I love my long rides. :("
leaves,fgr7jxg,t1_fgqm9pb,1581040081.0,"It’s not about “self control” - it’s about how our brain chemistry is affected. I can drink without issue. Some might call that self control. I am still an addict though. Weed makes me very out of control because of the way it effects my brain - just like alcoholics can’t just have one drink. 
Saying it’s all about self control makes addicts feel even more ashamed and worthless which is a big catalyst for relapse."

This trick works really well!"
Posture,fgqje68,t3_ezypin,1581025334.0,"I have the same problem as you and have found yoga to be helpful for the same reason. Bridge pose, specifically, has really helped. I focus less on getting my hips high and more on squeezing my shoulders/arms together and pressing them into the floor."

I’m much healthier and fitter now and that’s a direct result of my better mental health. I had to get my mind right first."

leaves,fgpxdmc,t1_fgpwgc9,1581013825.0,"I hear you. Sometimes I feel guilty too. What helps me put things into perspective is the thought “would I deny a 3 year old their need for fresh air and exercise? Or a nap if they were exhausted? Would I tell my best friend they are being a selfish wimp for needing to enforce healthy boundaries or take a break?” Of course not! I would either meet their need directly or gently encourage them to meet it! 

Why are you any less deserving of that then the 3 year old version of yourself or your dearest friend? You’re not! Now go do the thing you need to do to take care of you. When you meet your needs you are more healthy and whole and this world needs a healthy, whole you."

Status symbols confer a lot less status than the people who buy them - think. 
What does stand out to me is posture, ease, good grooming and relaxed and friendly confidence. THOSE things confer status to me and the beautiful part is it’s accessible to anyone. Money has nothing to do with it."
