BipolarReddit,feme1pn,t1_fem2z8f,1579250676.0,"That sounds like a great dr/patient relationship. I felt I had a similar relationship with my therapist. But she dropped me as a client because I wasn’t willing to go deeper into the trauma work. I understand it. She is in high demand because she is really good at it but I felt a little hurt because she knows me so well and it’s hard to find therapists that are willing to work with someone with bipolar disorder and a “traumatic background.” I know she’s doing good by helping people that are ready and willing to do the work but the selfish part of me wants her to help me in other ways. It’s just all connected and it feels like a knot of thread. It is, I just don’t think any to believe all that thread originates from trauma."
dankmemes,feloryn,t1_felg2ko,1579227280.0,"Plus some men also don’t feel secure once a woman earns more. It’s not necessarily they are sexist. But growing up in a society that has said “men are bread winners” probably does a number on your sense of self, your role. You may understand it’s stupid but that doesn’t mean it has sunk in that masculinity isn’t intrinsically tied to greater earning power.

Like when a woman who has been career focused doesn’t know how to do certain household tasks can make them feel less womanly or “out of place.”

Divorce and finances is more multifaceted than it seems."

ABraThatFits,feldzgc,t1_fekvi2j,1579219944.0,In between sizes now. I have pants that are too big and pants that totally compress my thighs and butt.
ABraThatFits,feldpka,t1_fel3e8m,1579219759.0,Lol same. My bra comes off as soon as I step into my room after work or school. I have some pjs but flannel sheets and fuzzy blankets feel so nice on bare skin.
BipolarReddit,feldbxg,t3_epq0nl,1579219506.0,"That’s wonderful about your psychiatrist, super thoughtful. She sounds like someone that sees you holistically rather than just your mental health. It can be hard to find psychiatrists like that.

As for the TMS referral. I don’t have experience with it but I have started thinking about it. I have started researching studies but if you find anything interesting or decide to start treatment, I think it would be great if you chronicle it. It might help others too. 

It’s always helpful to hear people’s experiences to different medications and treatments to get a sense of the possible outcomes or what it will be like. 

Best of luck to you! :)"
CasualConversation,felcfby,t3_epiaam,1579218901.0,"Hey u/24hourhugger , I know I am late to the party. But I think you will be building a great skill! I know you said you’d like your own business but I know theater companies look for set builders (carpenters, welders). You might start out as an apprentice and gain some skills and you can eventually move on to do your own thing. Just a little something to consider especially since there is a huge theater scene over there!"
relationships,fehlk2v,t1_feh1bsa,1579119001.0,"Definitely do it with your grandmother. It would mean so much to your mother and her siblings (if she has any). I did and audio recording of my grandfather’s life before he passed, we didn’t expect him to. I haven’t edited the audio because I haven’t been able to but when I do, I plan to make copies for my family.

Google translate can help, I’m sure. Also, if she understand English you can ask in English and she can answer in Spanish, perhaps?"

dankmemes,feg437x,t1_feehjso,1579076008.0,"Sort of depends who you ask though. Pew Research considers ‘97 to be the beginning of Gen Z so they place the oldest at 22. For them, millennials span from 23 to 38. Nielsen on the other hand says the oldest Gen Z are 24. McKinsey says 23. No one really agrees when these generations start and end lol

AdAge marks the Gen Alpha oldest kids are 9 or 10. So, as you can imagine, consumer behavior studies are already coming out on them."
AskWomen,fef5ss0,t1_fef2w9v,1579048858.0,"Before my therapist dropped me, dysmorphia was one of the “lesser” things we were working on. We mostly did thought replacement activities. Write the most common negative thoughts you have and craft a positive one to replace it. It was tedious and I hated it, I felt stupid doing it. It worked somewhat but honestly I would still cry during a workout or sometimes feel even worse than I did before the workout. It’s hard when it’s really ingrained; it takes lots of practice. Sometimes I couldn’t stand more than 10 min, not because my body couldn’t but my mind wouldn’t let me."

bipolar,fcbtzo1,t1_fcbsi39,1577590957.0,"Yup, if you go to the three dots on the top right corner (as if to edit your post), you should be able to see a mark NSFW option. It will blur your picture so that people don’t see it on the feed unless they click to see. That way, can avoid it if they wish once they read your title. 

Again, I am glad you were able to divert those negative feelings!"
bipolar,fcbn3gq,t3_egy3co,1577588758.0,"Perhaps mark NSFW. It’s a little jarring, might really trigger someone.

Hope you’re feeling better."
