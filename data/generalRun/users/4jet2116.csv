PrequelMemes,fezi42y,t1_fezfc7s,1579457611.0,Homie is right. In the early 2000s the prequels were getting absolutely shit on. There is actually a 2010 documentary made (the People vs George Lucas) that is about how hated the prequels were. ROTS is without a doubt the best prequel film but it wasn’t unanimously loved when it came out.
