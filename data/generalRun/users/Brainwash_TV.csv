melbourne,fflf6ak,t3_eu2fd5,1580038957.0,I've never seen a thread so all over the place since my cat destroyed one of my socks.
melbourne,ffl44mm,t1_ffl0pbo,1580034471.0,Aren't we all?
melbourne,ffkzzop,t1_ffkzqs5,1580032256.0,I'm sure all the acknowledging in the world will take away the pain the Aboriginal people have suffered.
videos,ffkwfy2,t1_ffklu25,1580030244.0,"As someone who has to wear these masks at work when there's an infection, they work but only for a limited amount of time. Once you breathe on them repeatedly they eventually become wet/moist, and once that happens they are literally useless - may as well not be wearing anything at all. You have to regularly change them for them to be effective, most people don't know this though and just wear the same mask all day either to save money or out of ignorance."
melbourne,ffkvam2,t1_ffk8wqa,1580029614.0,"Seriously I've never understood the hypocrisy of this. ""Always was and always will be Aboriginal land."" Okay then, so would you be cool if an Aboriginal family took over your home and told you to live somewhere else, it's their land after all. No? Then shut the fuck up and stop virtue signalling. Either put your money where your mouth is or shut. The. Fuck. Up.

Edit: No one wants to admit that if you really cared wholeheartedly about these people and agreed it was an invasion and their land was stolen and legitimately wanted to right these wrongs, the only logical solution is to surrender/return all land/resources to them and have EVERYONE who isn't Aboriginal leave the country. But no one wants to face that harsh truth, they just want to offer hollow pledges and say 'Sorry', and when their bluff is called just respond with ""well at least it's a step in the right direction"". It's the biggest cop out ever and simply a way to remove your feeling of guilt without doing anything actually actionable to resolve said wrongdoings."
melbourne,ffhy5yp,t1_ffhxctb,1579958955.0,Well it literally originated in China so...

todayilearned,ff7v0dp,t1_ff6z8qg,1579659009.0,"""I'm ready, I'm ready."""
videos,ff5om0i,t1_ff5mcbi,1579603472.0,"To get deep into the psychology of it it's basically the Madonna-whore complex playing out. These dudes enjoy the idea of getting the attention of the girl who won't show it to everyone but if they're persistent and ""lucky"" enough she'll eventually show it to them (not gonna happen), or at least give them the attention they're so desperately craving. Cam girls aren't appealing because everyone and anyone can see their hoo hoo for a couple o' buckeroos."
ContagiousLaughter,ff4sf5s,t1_ff2ixhz,1579571324.0,"Okay so I guess the entire sex toy industry, which is primarily dildos and vibrators (objects literally shaped as dicks) is just novelty? Women only buy them to hang them on their wall and use them for lightsabre fights. Grow the fuck up and stop projecting your ideals onto an entire sex.
Women don't see male prostitutes just for hugs or domestic duties. Am I taking crazy pills here?
Just because males are statistically more likely to sexualise things does not mean that it is entirely a novelty for all women."
melbourne,ff2pd4b,t3_er9k7d,1579517732.0,This is fine.
ContagiousLaughter,ff2klz0,t1_ff2ixhz,1579510480.0,"I know tons of women personally who would object to your point. But I guess you're more concerned with calling people who object to your point of view dipshits.

Edit: amazing how I'm the one being civil and the person being abusive gets upvoted while I get down voted for simply offering a different point of view. I really fucking hate reddit, sometimes."
rickandmorty,ff2ii03,t1_ff2gwi9,1579507619.0,I'd say it had a lot of bite to it.
ContagiousLaughter,ff2ifmn,t1_ff2h5ig,1579507532.0,"So that's why Magic Mike was such an unpopular movie and groups like Man Power aren't hugely successful? And why there's an entire section on Pornhub called ""popular with women"" - because women never watch it. You see where I'm going with this, right?"
melbourne,ff2cowt,t1_ff1plxx,1579500881.0,Noted: red on back = redback spider.
melbourne,ff2ckzc,t1_ff22cc6,1579500768.0,"So it becomes someone else's problem? If you're talking small harmless spiders, sure, but this is literally like passing poison with legs onto a neighbour because you want to feel better about yourself."

gameofthrones,fdn5xl9,t3_em40wm,1578578187.0,When the buildup to TWOW literally lasts longer than an actual buildup to Winter in the Game of Thrones universe.

todayilearned,fdlqbtw,t3_elurq0,1578529961.0,"I'm in disability care so have worked with quite a few people who have cerebral palsy. One dude was self harming and the sure fire way to get him to stop every time was by singing Queen. Any Queen song, but he especially loved We Will Rock You, and I'll be honest it was the easiest to remember. He would literally go from massive aggression to smiling his ass off in a matter of seconds as soon as he heard that music."

makinghiphop,fd8pokj,t1_fd8oi1q,1578221505.0,Basically the tone of voice and how the thing actually sounds as opposed to how it is delivered.

melbourne,fctkewx,t3_eishy7,1577946460.0,"You're much more game than me. I have a small army of maggies that frequent my backyard because our entire neighbourhood feeds them and gives them water. Not all the time, but as a treat every now and then (the water however is always there).

MotivationalPics,fcbzuex,t3_egubiy,1577592817.0,"Yeah but the water only gets inside when the ship gets so fucking tipped that water pours in, or a wave slams so hard against the ship it actually breaks the ship itself.

Been sober for just over 2 months now and have had nothing but intense nightmare after nightmare (generally multiple in one night) every single night for the entire time. Even when I wake up and know ""it was just a dream"" I don't want to go back to sleep for fear that I'll go back into the nightmare or enter a new one. Shit is definitely not fun."
