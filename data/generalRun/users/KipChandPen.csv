My Uncle David died of AIDS when I was four-years-old. My family made a video tape with pictures of him, and this song was playing in the background. I always think of him deteriorating before my eyes when I hear it. He was an amazing man."

AskReddit,fecgan4,t3_eo6l00,1578973210.0,"My Latin teacher had a rule that if you borrowed a pencil that you had to leave a shoe, to make sure you returned it. A kid in my class took this as “you have to leave an item of clothing”. When she was working at her desk and not paying attention, he took off his shirt in exchange for a pencil. He sat there for 5 minutes before my Latin teacher noticed, and she FLIPPED OUT. It was hilarious!"
