kratom,feubyjc,t1_fetvoud,1579385116.0,Lexapro almost killed me. Made me very suicidal & having homicidal thoughts. Felt better after I got off it. SSRI’s are dangerous to some people. If you need help read Dr. Kelly Brogan’s books. She’s a holistic psychiatrist. Her work & program has helped me greatly & taking Kratom twice a week.
CPTSDmemes,feu09yq,t1_fetl783,1579381830.0,I had DID for years. I’m fully integrated now. You can do it. Somatic Experiencing therapy & Reiki helped me greatly.

kratom,feklmwv,t1_fejz5jk,1579202613.0,I was upwards to 20 grams per day (40 capsules). 20 capsules an hour after I woke up & 20 more 6 hours later. This went on for a couple years. Then I tried to quit it cold turkey. That was absolute hell withdrawals. Then I tapered to a low dose & now only take 5 grams every Tuesday & Saturday. I just mix it in orange juice or take capsules with orange juice.
kratom,feklbvq,t1_fejmw1y,1579202432.0,Tuesday & Saturday
addiction,fejcgm4,t3_epfu57,1579167093.0,"Former opiate addict here. I understand. Try Kratom short term there’s a Reddit group for any questions on it, & do EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) there’s tons of YouTube videos. Brad Yates is a good channel."

kratom,fej5w0k,t1_feiuxu5,1579158157.0,"I became dependent on it & abused the fuck out of it. I completely was self-medicating on it & disrespecting the plant. I forced myself to go down to twice a week. Harm reduction. Only allowed on Tuesday & Saturday nights now. No if’s, &’s or but’s. It’s an amazing & healing plant. But shouldn’t be used daily for a mental illness. Don’t suffer the hell I went through."
kratom,fej5v5l,t1_fej23q4,1579158128.0,Yep 100% accurate. I learned the hard way. Down to twice a week now.

kratom,fefab46,t1_feexf2u,1579051887.0,Why do you take Kratom & Vicodin? Kratom is way safer & gives a better feeling. I fear him being apart of the opiate epidemic if he used Vicodin. Why I’m giving him 🍃.
kratom,fefa6kh,t1_fef4t3m,1579051805.0,Good info. But this is a Kratom forum why would you recommend something highly addictive & dangerous? I don’t want my BF to be apart of the opiate epidemic why I gave him Kratom. The Kratom works for like 6 hours then the pain comes back.
kratom,fefa1i8,t1_feew5y3,1579051712.0,That’s good he needs sleep RN. It’s been hard for him cuz of the pain. Sorry to hear you have fibro. I’m sure Kratom helps.
