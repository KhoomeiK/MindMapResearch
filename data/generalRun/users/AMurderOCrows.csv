The light coming from a hot object has to do, iirc, with blackbody radiation. The problem becomes thermodynamic instead of electromagnetic.

Edit: I responded and forgot what you asked - mobile smh. Once you have light waves, i.e. oscillating electric and magnetic eaves tied together, the Poynting vector is defined as being proportional their cross product. Since often the magnetic field is is proportional to the electric field in space, you end up with the Poynting vector being proportional to one of their squares amplitudes."
