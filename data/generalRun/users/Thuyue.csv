Without the free English Leaks and Translation, many fans wouldn't have bought or ever known the LN. I mean ofc there are tons of people who bought the LN anyway (is it because they were huge web novel fans or overall supporters). He has totally right to be angry, but the leaks and free translation promoted his series to such a degree that more people would eventually buy the LN.

Isekai,feasjv6,t1_feagjr0,1578951871.0,"Can't deny it, it is truly sounding horribly depressing. However there is a actual reason behind it. The summary ended with a open end, so a summary reader couldn't know. The story isn't about just tragedy. I want to make the story interesting by implementing the story of a struggler and someone depressed who may find his way with life. It's all about finding one own meaning of life. It also takes the lesson, that dying isn't always the best solution to flee from reality, nor does living a new life (in another world) doesn't make things always better. People have one life, and only in that one life, they will be remembered. 

Thank you for critics! I will rework the summary several times, to see if it will reach the effect i want."

depression,feaq27v,t1_fe8t4ur,1578951242.0,"There can be many reasons for suicide, but in the end the most common reason is to end the suffering for themselves. So it's selfish. But is selfish wrong? No! To be honest, every \*human action\* is selfish when viewed from a different perspective. Every action has the goal of achieving satisfaction. This includes actions that help others or to satisfy other people. If some were not satisfied by helping others or making them happy, they simply would not. Acting selflessly simply means acting indirectly selfishly while acting positively for another person.

\*Simply put:\* You help a person, because you either like the person or you want to follow a morale. Thus the action of helping a person makes you happy.

If some consideres suicide as a the better option, it simply means that they think that the end of life and suffering means more satisfaction, than rather living for themselves or other persons they love. Be it a impulsive thought or final thought."

To your second question. Yes, i have played a MMORPG before, and yes i know they either cost huge money or time. However i don't think that we should compare Yggdrasil and the world of Suzuki Satoru to our world nor to our player base. Suzuki's world is literally a shithole. People go to work and then come home to play, because the air is polluted and toxic, the cities and the nature are f*cked and the society is also shit. People tend to go inside a game to completly start a other life. Ofc they are super pissed and probably quit the game in case they loose something precious. However many player in Yggdrasil came into the game as casuals, enjoying the landscape and building their own bases (like Minecraft) and enjoying adventures. If they lost something they start again. Yggdrasil was a unique game for its time, so players either liked it or not. The money flow didn't stopped in any case."

The Wikia also mentions that a Guild then could raise their standing within the gaming community to the Top. Only those who lost their world item afterwards, would fall back and loose their Top Guild Status. One of those Guilds battled Ainz Ooal Gown and lost their World Item ""Depiction of Nature and Society"". It was then that they lost their standing as a Top Guild. Also Ainz states that in the top 50 were several Guilds that did not possess a world item, because some Top Guilds were intelligent enough to protect them."

After all the world of Yggdrasil was extremely huge, and finding a World Item was a big rarity. And as i said many objects and structures were protected by the game. There is a huge difference between the new world and Yggdrasil after all. I personally don't think that they ruin a game, at least not to the degree you describe them to be."

CautiousHero,fdh7oqz,t1_fdh59cj,1578417168.0,"No, the possibility of more high destructive scale world items is highly possible. After all, only a small portion of World Items were ever known to the game. With world breaking i mean't literally breaking a world to it's core, until its explode. I mean you are right that most world items a either not from destructive nature or from a destructive nature that could not bust a planet. So if we consider in sheer destructive power of a planet, i would say that ""World Savior"" could reach such point due it's unlimited growth in power. The more important questions however are: How literally did Ristarte meant it, when she stated the fact about Judgement Zero? Did she mean't the entire Planet Surface/Planet/Universe? After all the word ""world"" can have many meanings including something smaller like a continent or even an island. Secondly how much can we consider the destructive power of the Demon Lord to his other powers. For example a humans kick exert much more force than a human punch. The same is probably applicable to the Demon Lord. His body was undoubtedly strong that it resisted a Valhalla Gate including its Goddess enhanced fangs, yet he ""only"" fought on par with Seiya, who is undoubtedly very strong but not planet surface/planet/universe level. That means his body could not exert the world destroying force on the Gate of Valhalla."
CautiousHero,fdh4ukz,t1_fdh0nh7,1578415413.0,"Hm i would rather say: Because Ainz Ooal Gown got a World Items, he became a Top Player. Basically any Player who has a World Item can become a Top Player, while not every Top Player has necessarily a World Item."

He happened to have \*\*One\*\* world items always by his side, and there are World Items residing in his Tomb from his guild. Without enough preparation Ainz could undoubtly loose against Seiya or any other foe. He happened be a Top Player within a Top Guild of Pay2Win Game. The efforts of his guild just laid the groundwork, so they would have many options and solutions in overcoming situations. Beside that matter, it would be weird if a noob player gets a world items and is able to protect it, No?"
CautiousHero,fdgwyzc,t1_fdgtxy0,1578410382.0,"Strong can be interpreted in many ways. Seiya after all showed that his close combat skills are enough to hold off the Demon Lord, but he wouldn't be able to block Judgement Zero. I think the same applies to Ainz. Ainz isn't that overpowered as people like to show him be. Ainz just happened to be a Top Player within a Top Player Guild, who has been transfered into a world of weaklings (even though in comparison, they would be stronger than people of our reality). World Items are stated to be Items that break the Game Balance and they are made to be unfair. Thats why World Items are absolutely unique, hard to find,almost everytime only for One Time Usage, and can be stolen. I stated that there powers are unrivaled, beside themselves, but still people with World Items can be tricked. That had already happened to Ainz Ooal Gown several times. Thats why Ainz as a Veteran had so much experience and cautioness just like Seiya after his incident.  


Btw a world items that could break the world wouldn't be to far fetched, but luckily Ainz does not possess those."
CautiousHero,fdgqsg4,t1_fdgojpz,1578405894.0,"I personally think that the Demon Lord also used Judgement Zero out of anger. The demon lord already almost freed himself out of the first gate, before its fang has been enhanced by Ristarte's hair.

Second thing. Yes Causality can change reality, because Causality describes the chain and fundamental between cause and impact. Reality however in the regard what i meant was the state of things we perceive. Causality thus can be described us. Changing the Reality between Cause and Impact in the world is the same as Causality itself. Beside that Gate of Valhalla only erases things out of existence after it has been completely imprisoned, as shown by the case of the demon lord or the reaper. The fangs and chains themself can be stopped. Furthermore World items are just a expression of Causality, they would react to the spell before it can take effect, hence why Ainz survived the Soul Breaker in the first place. My last argument is that the gate of Valhalla is basically a suicide move, world items however can be consumables or items for further usage."
CautiousHero,fdgmzty,t1_fdgjhmm,1578402730.0,"Well your aren't wrong about that, but there is a small thing to consider. The Gate indeed can manipulate Causality, but that's only to a certain point. Seiya for example had to strengthen the first Gate of Valhalla with the Goddess hairs to disable the movements of the S Rank Demon lord, and yet he couldn't killed him. No, instead the Demon Lord almost broke out himself, if not for the Second Gate of Valhalla, which only could be used due Ristarte giving Seiya a second life. The World Items in Yggdrasil/New World are described as Iressistible Allmighty Items. They can only be stopped with other World Items. But what are World Items? According to Yggdrasil they are part of the World Tree, able to change Reality and the worlds residing in it. Changing Reality can also change the Causality within breaking the chain between cause and impact. I guess it's pretty much the same."
CautiousHero,fdgiaz1,t1_fdggqoc,1578397982.0,"Gate of Valhalla could maybe work. However Ainz is in the possession of a World Items that protects him from Existence Erasure Abilities. The Elder Coffin Dragon Lord once used his Soul Breaker Breath, a wild magic spell and a trump card, that is cast by using souls as sacrifice (very similiar to Gate Of Valhalla by using ones own Life). The spell can erase the existence of any being, no matter its resistance or Level. However Ainz survived the spell through his World Item. Thus the probability that Gate of Valhalla could work, could be very low. The world item i am talking about has a unknown name, but it is known to be the red orb below his ribcage."
