Not only is there a lack of consistent standards for initial training, routine competency training varies *wildly* from precinct to precinct. Cops on the beat can sometimes go *years* before being reevaluated on basic policing skills.

This creates the kind of chaos you saw in Miami."

Police chases have increased significantly since the 90s. Several researchers have posited that it's directly related to an increase in news coverage (particularly live news coverage) of police chases."

There is an entire subreddit dedicated to making fun of poor writing by men writing women characters (/r/menwritingwomen). Do you really think there is no critical analysis of any media besides video games?

You never addressed my original point. Are games art? If they are, then why do you think they are above criticism?

I'd take you more seriously if this was at all in good faith but it's clear you've swallowed ""feminism is ruining western culture"" hook, line, and sinker.

You should probably spend some time reading feminist theory. I'd recommend starting with *The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir.*

As for the last point you make, I much more frequently hear ""gamers"" ask ""why don't more women play video games?"". It's because women don't feel welcome. It may be because of a vocal minority but they are extremely vocal and the larger community actively defends them."
