applehelp,ffb2ry8,t1_ff955xo,1579750333.0,"Option A: 
Get an after market replacement from Amazon (cost <$50.00), you can even get a whole repair kit for that much. Do it yourself, only if you have steady hands & can keep track of the assembly process. 
Option B: 
take it to a certified/Authorized Apple provider near you. 
Option C (highly recommend): 
find a good/reputable small repair shop near you (sometimes you can find them @ the mall): I’m sure they have the parts & tools to fix it for a LOT less than what Apple would charge. 

Also, if the original screen is not a Retina display, then you will never tell the difference once you have the after market screen on."

research,ff62gq6,t3_errk4u,1579617455.0,"You don’t need to add any proposals/documents to get on board with a professor! Share your interests in his/her work the same way you did on here! 
Also, ask if your professor is working on something specific right now and check if they can recommend some readings (literature/journal articles) from their most recent publications. At this stage in your academic career, showing interest is good enough! 
Good luck!"

I didn’t come across any, yet, in SoCal. I guess I’m just still trying the wide variety of ethnic cuisines here, Asian, Mexican, etc. I do need to find an authentic Italian spot tho. Not the washed up version of Italian food @ Olive Garden or in similar franchises. Def nothing like the Italian/Mediterranean food I’ve tried across the Atlantic."
MakeNewFriendsHere,fcrifrm,t1_fcrhqmb,1577902236.0,You had me at culture! Def love that aspect of Pasadena and SoCal! Haven’t experienced any of it before I moved here from the Southern part of the East coast
MakeNewFriendsHere,fcrh0pm,t1_fcrgoyt,1577901717.0,"Oh man! Sorry to hear. 
Honestly, Pasadena is one of my fav places in SoCal because it always looks neat, clean and not as crazy as DTLA... Although, I’m only familiar with a few streets in that area like Colorado, foothill and orange grove (probably the nicest)."
