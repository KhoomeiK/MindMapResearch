I'm not claiming it's health food, but I wouldn't say it's very high up on the list of foods that people living healthy lifestyles need to avoid.

Potatoes are known to be highly saturating which is a bonus for people trying to eat less - but they're also high in potassium, vitamin c and of course fiber! The fried part is a shame and makes it all less healthy... But I can see a samosa having its place as a healthy snack/lunch - especially because variation in a diet is a key to helping people stick to diets... Ie if you give someone a boiled potato with an egg everyday for lunch then they won't last long :)

Tldr: it's not health food but that doesn't mean it can't be a part of an overall healthy diet."
AskReddit,ffyo48w,t1_ffyl44a,1580351045.0,"Or people could have common sense, and realize that a topic about people who are secretly depressed isn't a place to make jokes about said people.

AskReddit,ffynuvr,t1_ffyfxil,1580350865.0,"Hang on a minute... Adding a ""dark joke"" disclaimer doesn't mean you're not a complete dick for saying it, and it doesn't make it funny either.

The only way that joke could be funny is if you are laughing at someone because you think you're better than them based on their hobbies. Ie had it been a different story and you said ""you spent 10k on a car? No wonder she left"" that wouldn't be funny to anyone.

So you think you're better than someone, because you judge their hobby to be worth less than they do/previously have done... Well that's simply sad, and others' hobbies aren't up to you to decide. 

Furthermore, as someone who hasn't ever played MTG - I understand how 10k is possible... I've spent more than that on power tools, and my musician mates easily have setups worth around that. MTG has the bonus of involving collectables, so you can strike it lucky and end up with something worth more than what you paid and some things will appreciate over time... :/ 10k is not a lot to spend on a hobby.

Hence your joke boils down to being ""she left you because you like MTG"" and the only way that could be funny is if you think you're better than someone based on their hobbies."

To beat the chimp you need to do it in less than 3 seconds 90 percent of the time. It can be done.

I remember practicing years ago when I saw this on Digg, and I found it easy enough to beat the chimp even with a mouse and computer monitor. I tried now however and it seems impossible... Just practice though.

It reminds me of the speed reading apps which flash words at you so that you cannot subvocalise. It's amazing what your brain actually can do"
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffye9z7,t1_ffxxj6k,1580344350.0,"I was a pretty good kid by most accounts... But I once discovered my dad would leave yesterday's jeans on the bedroom floor - and there'd usually be money in the pockets. For a few days I was making bank and kept visiting the dairy for lollies after each successful heist.

Eventually my mum called me out saying ""how are you getting lollies everyday? I only give you x dollars a week and that isn't enough for what you're bringing home"". I confessed on the spot, however still had to face my dad. My mum made me take what money I had left, present it to him and admit what I had done.

I timidly apologized, and my dad asked what I was going to spend the money on. I told him lollies. He said ""alright, let's go to the dairy together and get your last lot of lollies then! Make sure you share them, but next time you steal from me there will be consequences""

I never stole from my parents again. I felt so shitty. I think if I had been made to wash the car to repay what I'd stolen it would have felt like a punishment - but also in a way it would have justified the stealing because there was a transaction. Instead, I felt like I had betrayed the trust of my parents who loved me and actually *wanted* to give me things/lollies (just ib moderation :p).

So I don't think we can draw up too much from the video. Consequences are best not applied universally - it really depends on the personality of the child, and the interpersonal dynamics of the specific parent/child relationship."
Cooking,ffy3jrr,t1_ffwvv1g,1580337874.0,Samosas aren't especially fattening or even unhealthy? A lot of people could easily have a couple for lunch and be satisfied until dinner without having to worry about their weight at all. Even if you're on a diet you could fit samosas in if it's simply a case of limiting calories :/
newzealand,ffxu68a,t1_ffws0pk,1580332493.0,"I don't follow? The landlord has paid an insurance excess, hence it's a recoverable cost from the tenant. The fact that the excess has been paid implies the the insurance has paid out for the repairs. Therefore, the tenant remedial payments for repairs is going towards work that has been completed - funded by the insurance company (plus the 6k excess).

Unless the landlord insurance didn't cover the repair work and is for something like payment defaults, I would expect the insurance company to be paid the repair costs by the tenants - not the landlord."

Christianity,ffvost6,t1_ffv9veg,1580269205.0,"Does it though? I'm perturbed by the complexities of sin. I suppose in some ways even as we worship while heartedly we stand in sin and among sin. Ir sinfulness is a state as much as a deed...

But these vans rely on slaves to be made. Do they actually honor Jesus? I know it may feel nuanced to some people, but for me it seems so black and white - how can we say a product of slavery brings honor to the one who liberates the oppressed.

The nuance for me is that we own so many products of slavery. Eg I'm typing on a nice shiny phone. But I wouldn't say the phone itself honors God - in some ways I'd say the opposite!"
newzealand,ffvlu1e,t1_ffvkeoy,1580267160.0,"That's not it, though. If you follow the thread the arguments are (roughly) that Labour is prioritizing roads over decarbonising assets, and that Labour has less standards in place than National (ie we've regressed). I don't think the claim has been ""it's not enough, we need perfection"". It's fairer to read the claims as ""it's not enough, we need to maintain if not tighten the standards the National government implemented / and it's not enough to invest so much in roads while neglecting carbon emissions""
