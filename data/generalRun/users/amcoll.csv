Turns out where my desk was near one of the corners was an almost perfect acoustic mirror. A guy 3 desks down couldn't hear me talking, but this bitch across the office heard every word i said

It was a truly horrible place to work. We couldn't even wear headphones because the CEO didn't want us isolating ourselves, she wanted to promote a friendly, chatty workplace, so we all sat in this noisy, intrusive environment, getting fuck all done, and just churning through staff. I lasted 9 months, which was 8 and 7 months longer than my previous 2 predecessors"

A low level of white noise from quiet conversation, office sounds etc can be quite easy to relax into, but all it takes is that one inconsiderate twat to lower the productivity of an entire floor

Anyway, if open plan was such a great thing, how comes senior management all still have their offices?"

rugbyunion,fficfi4,t1_ffhs1t3,1579970550.0,"My favourite part was in the first interview. Hask had obviously been giving him a hard time about his caravan earlier in the show during one of the many edited out parts, probably a lot of pikey jokes in there which would explain why it was cut

Anyway, there was a part later in the show that went something like this

Alex: God help us all, we really need to get this show back on track...

Joe: I don't appreciate taking the Lords name in vain

Alex: Do you believe in god then Joe?

Hask: He doesn't need to, he's got lucky heather!

I nearly crashed the car into a tree i was laughing so hard

My other favourite was an interview with England TV on youtube. There were at Pennyhill Park, the presenter knocked on his hotel room door, Joe answered, snatched the mic off of him, slammed the door shut, and then conducted the entire interview through a closed door. Oh, and his interview on Radio 1 during the RWC was gold as well

He's never dull, the game needs more guys like Hask and Joe to counter all the press managed player interviews, the characters make the game what it is

If you don't already listen to it, BBC's Rugby Union podcast has gotten really good lately, especially the shows with Ugo, Danny Care and Chris Ashton. DC and Ashy are constantly playing off each other and its really funny"

I am seriously impressed with the speed they respond to tickets, and more importantly, you get someone on the phone who is properly switched on immediately, and not the usual 1st line meat filters who's job it is to keep the public away from the clever techs

Dell gold prosupport also gets a +1 for this, local techs who treat you as a peer, and don't make you jump through hoops as they complete the mandatory help script.

It depends what you want, if you just want something to get your attention, beyond normal email alerts, there's some good options suggested here already. If you want a full blown, battle stations klaxon, something like MQTT messages sent to a node red server, and cobbling together a DIY audio device with a single board computer like a Pi or Arduino for node red to trigger could work."

sysadmin,fdyalkw,t3_ems5s5,1578777733.0,"Not worked on the older CS series, but a few notes from my very recent experience

Figure out if you're going to go down the route of VMFS or VVOL volumes before you start. If going VVOL, remember that vcenter controls everything, not the SAN. Build your vols in vcenter using the Nimble vcenter plugin, don't be tempted to manage it from the SAN like you would a VMFS volume, you'll just end up in a mess. Do the initial SAN setup config from the Nimble portal, then forget it exists

If you're not on vcenter 6.7, upgrade that first. 6.0 is supported, but I had all kinds of problems until I upgraded

Dedupe only runs on thin provisioned vmdk's. If you have thick provisioned, you can convert them to thin in the vcenter wizard when you migrate them over

Prepare your VM storage policies ahead of time, and have them applied to your volumes before migrating anything. You can apply them retrospectively, but it's a lot easier to do before migration

Haven't set up replication yet, but am off to the US this week to do that, so will report back any further gotchas
