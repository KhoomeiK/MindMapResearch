ufc,feyzqqd,t1_feyxpz4,1579452483.0,"Fair enough, but this was clearly going to be a win for McGregor. 

I'd still say Diaz over Cowboy because I'm speaking of recent years, not 5 years ago Cowboy. Henderson V Cowboy was a close decision of 3 rounds, not 5 rounds like Diaz v Henderson, which wasn't close by any stretch.

Cowboy was TKOed by Ferg and Gaethje, and now McGregor, so I dont think it's crazy to say that he's not at his best lately."

fightporn,feysalk,t1_feyqqfp,1579449988.0,"Lmao, imagine thinking he stood a chance. I was saying round 2 KO by Conor for weeks, but the 40 second 1st round TKO was unexpected.

ufc,fex06l2,t1_fewz1y9,1579422184.0,"I don't think he seems too different yet, but I would like to see such improvement. Khabib doesn't want a rematch and I don't think Conor will move down weight or vice versa. Other fighters deserve a shot anyways.

It will be McGregor Vs. Masvidal, if not his very next fight definetly this year. Given their history in shittalking it will be a fun buildup, and given how well Masvidal can strike it will be really entertaining. I can't judge 170 McGregor yet but I'll still put my money (figuratively) on Masvidal. I hope they put him against Usman this year, but Colby's striking was impressive and it would be interesting to see Masvidal work around either Colby or Usman's wrestling abilities like he did with Askren."
ufc,fewxrl3,t1_fewx4y7,1579421124.0,"He lost to both Diaz and Khabib, even if he beat Diaz by decision in the rematch. Diaz and Khabib aren't on the same level or even in the same weight class. What I'm saying is this was a joke of a matchup just so Conor could flex and say ""oh I'm the only one to have TKOs in 3 weight classes, it's the only way I can be special."" Your opinion that McGregor is better than ever because he beat a washed up fighter in 40 seconds means your opinion is wrong when he already thrashed Aldo in 13. Goodbye."
ufc,fewwhra,t1_fewkooo,1579420567.0,How could you tell when he beat a fighter far beneath Diaz or Khabib? I don't think this is a fair way to measure McGregor's growth when all he did was stomp a dude that was way worse and then promote his whiskey for longer than the fight lasted.

It's $10-20 cheaper to buy from Amazon than Wal-Mart, Sephora, Ulta, etc... with added the convenience of not having to go anywhere and ask someone to unlock a case for cologne.

Next time I'll consider buying one directly and comparing it with an old one, or purchasing both to compare and simply having a 3 year supply.

I also checked out the trailer you sent me and I'm more worried about the secondhand cigarette smoke I recieved for most of my life than whatever carcinogens would be in the cologne that I don't even wear daily, but thank you for your concern."

In the same way you could get the completely opposite half from your mother and father than what your siblings got (although some genes may be the same regardless of which 'half'). But since there are millions and millions of genes getting mixed and sorted around, it ends up being about 50% shared between siblings, like if you flipped a coin millions and millions of times and got heads about half of the time."
