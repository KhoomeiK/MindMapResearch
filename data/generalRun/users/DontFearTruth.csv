Since the invention of assistive glasses, it hasn't been as negative on survival. So the number of people with the genetic defect have been breeding more often. There are a lot more people alive today who need glasses then there was back then. 

So if you're imagining the same number of people as there are today, that would be inaccurate. Bonus if you remember that a huge portion of the population was illiterate so not being able to read wasn't a real problem."

Not to mention [this one about the $3.6 trillion it will cost to rebuild the infrastructure.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/blockchain-and-36-trillion-infrastructure-crisis-2017-12-11) 

Do you know what these all have in common with your link? They have absolutely *nothing to do with what I was talking about*. 

If you actually read my [link](https://fortune.com/2019/02/21/us-health-care-costs-2/) you would know it talked about how much Americans spend on healthcare already. I don't know why you think posting a link that the amount of collected tax dollars are similar to the number in my link was relevant, but I'm guessing you thought the numbers almost matched and were pretty? 

A word of advice as well. The only people who call others ""kiddo"" are young people insecure about their age. I am guessing your....20? Maybe 22. Mimicking what you saw old people do on TV when you were a kid doesn't actually make you sound older.

todayilearned,felzge0,t1_felxo19,1579234964.0,"Once again, that's taxes and this is organ donations. Try and keep them separate. A country taking care of the people living in it should be handled differently than the process of translating and harvesting organs.

We already do that. Getting exemptions based on religious grounds is literally an example of that. 

It's their choice to opt out of being an organ donor. In this system that choice moves you farther down the priority list."
todayilearned,feljp4t,t1_feliq80,1579223808.0,"There's a difference between not being consistent and treating different things differently. I let people merge during traffic, but not in the checkout line.

And blood is a renewable resource that a person who loses it can make more of, lungs are not. We have a decent stock of blood. So that's not a good comparison. As the original post states, people who refuse donate will just be moved down the priority list. The only people complaining about that system are the ones who plan on not being organ donors. 

Also yeah I think it's pretty rational to want my tax system and my organ donor system to be handled separately. Considering they are substantially different and deserve to be treated accordingly."
