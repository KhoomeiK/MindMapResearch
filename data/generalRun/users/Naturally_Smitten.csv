baltimore,fffs221,t3_et2tci,1579890561.0,"I commend you for your efforts and for this post in seeking suggestions.  My comments are from a Black middle aged (52) woman's perspective who grew up in the Inner City. 

1) What are some things you wished the BPD would do that they don't?  I wish they would become aware of their biases.  Or at best, willing to admit to themselves that they/ we all have biases that influence the way we handle things.   There are conscious and unconscious biases.  Recognize your biases, work on correcting them, and understand they drive the way you act/ react. 

2) What are some things you wished the BPD wouldn't do that they do?   I wish they wouldn't discount disparities in arrests and incarceration of Black people.   Recognize that Blacks are arrested and incarcerated at higher rates than other populations.  We represent a minority population and a majority in the prison system.   This impacts the entire Black community.  Statistically, this doesn't make sense, so why is it happening?  The entire family is impacted.  Please be cognizant that an arrest of a Black man has a rippling effect. 

3) Whats a good/bad experience you've had with a BPD officer?   I was a much younger/ more attractive woman, and a police officer pulled my car over.  If my memory serves me correctly, it was on a darkened road.  I didn't have enough sense or confidence to drive to a  public area.  I was nervous because I was pulled over, but I was scared to death because the officer was attracted to me and made comments about ""getting"" with me.  I believe he reached over and felt my thigh.  I was terrified!  I played along as if I were attracted to him too (I wasn't).  After a little banter,  I pretended that I had to get my son and was super busy and promised to call him (I didn't).  He had given me his telephone number and he let me go.  I drove off and was SO RELIEVED.  Needless to say, I never called him.  But I was frightened for a few weeks because I thought he would show up to my house.  Thank goodness, he didn't. 

4) What are some policies you wish the department would get rid of or add?  When I ride through some neighborhoods, I see police officers leaning against buildings and not interacting with folks - Penn/ North.  I guess their presence is supposed to be a deterrent to crime.  But when I see them, it looks like being in those neighborhoods is the last place they want to be, and they could care-a-less about the residents around them.  I wish they would talk to the residents instead of looking down at them. 

I hope you find my responses helpful and happy to clarify anything.  Thanks again!"

I followed a chocolate buttercream recipe that required espresso powder, and I found that it enhanced the flavor of the chocolate.  It did not taste like coffee, but the taste of the chocolate became, I don't know... more complex/ enriched/ just better.  I did not dissolve the espresso powder in liquid and the buttercream was not gritty."
