leaves,ffhn1po,t3_etfxjm,1579943223.0,"I truly, truly needed to read this exact message. Thank you u/meeekn you really have helped my mindset. I have quit so many times and I swear it gets harder (not easier) to get back on the sober wagon once I fall off. I'll smoke for months on end after a single slip-up and during those months (like now) all I want is to desperately quit again, but there's something inside, like a wall, that's like ""nope, you are gonna think about quitting but once you arrive at home your wife will be blowing smoke in your face and making fun of you for the millionth time for trying to quit. You're going to yell at her and then smoke and watch TV with her and sit and dwell and fall further into your addiction because fuck it."" Then I awake for work, groggy and disappointed...  then all I want is to quit again. 

This mindset change you have spelled out is perfect for my situation. Instead of me falling into depression and anxiety towards the thought process of ""never being able to smoke again"" and freaking out, instead I'm going to tell myself, Dude, this is all  you have ever wanted, all of your dreams and passions and goals with become a reality, all you need to do is know that you don't NEED to smoke, you don't NEED to be high, you want to be. And by wanting it then that will only lead me further from who i want to be and the life i am dying to live. So no, i will not smoke today, nor tomorrow, because I have a new me to be!"
battlefield_4,ffbhhsm,t3_escetk,1579765522.0,"Awesome clip brother! Since you are coming from other non-Battlefield titles like CoD I'm going to assume that you usually play normal FPS game modes like Team Deathmatch and other game modes, and on BF4 they are just as amazing, but where BF4 really shines and becomes leagues better than any other modern military FPS period is the mode called Conquest. Conquest Large specifically is hands-down the seller for Battlefield titles. 

Nothing beats it. I mean literally nothing has beaten the exhilaration of ""Only in Battlefield Moments"" that happen so often when playing Conquest on BF4. 

I mean like spawning in as a recon or support or engineer on a teammate to an enemy attack chopper raining hell on a skyscraper you and your teammate are on top of or inside of. Then as the Skyscraper begins to fall, glass and debris scattering all around you, and you watch you teammate get sawed in half by the attack chopper, and as you jump off the skyscraper and parachute to safety that same attack heli with two enemy combatants in the chairs flies by you and you snipe the pilot out of the pilot seat and then send a SMAW, RPG, or toss C4 at the Heli as it spirals down below you and BOOM! Two kills and enemy heli down. Then as you hit the pavement in the skyscraper debris streets below, white smoke and ashen rubble thick in the air and making it hard to see, an enemy Tank rolls up. So you go prone, crawling towards it, C4 or RPG in hand, you are about to sneak up on it and take it out as well, and then KRRschhlik! You get your throat slit by an enemy recon who just watched your entire badass moment and silenced it with ease. 

Conquest is baller! Usually I go Team Death Match for two or three matches until I'm warmed up and then I play Conquest til my aim gets janky. Anyways! Sorry for the long ramble haha. I just don't want you to miss Conquest as it's the main mode for BF4 and most new players have no idea and assume TDM is the main like it is for the other FPS games like CoD."
battlefield_4,ff98ow9,t1_ff97v7i,1579707414.0,Awesome!! :D can I search for the server via PS version?
battlefield_4,ff8hbke,t1_ff88oce,1579678492.0,"One of my favorite teamplay based maps and it's free! Anyone can download the DLC pack and play it. Also Operation Outbreak is a great map, a jungle one. It's also free via some community type DLC packs. It's a badass jungle map but sadly there are no more US based servers for it :( I saw it around and played it maybe 8 months back. Super fun."
Warframe,fedaku3,t1_fed73el,1579005778.0,"Awesome! I mean similar as in, before beating Vor the gameplay loop was as thus: Hang out in my ship and upgrading my frame, mods, weapons, and etc. Then I would head out onto my next mission via the Navigation. I would be dropped into a mission and fight my way through to the objective and then escape to my Extraction Zone where i would beat the mission and return to my ship to start over with the upgrades or whatnot. 

But after beating Vor, all off a sudden I can now go quite a few places which I don't mind, as long as when I arrive to the place the node takes me the game at least tells me what my tasks are. Because this last time, I beat Vor, hung out on ship, then went to start a mission like usual but it took me to a City which I now know is Cetus and the Plains. When I arrived at Cetus there was no objective. There was nothing but myself and the world. So there was no game to be played. I was confused. Then I went into the Plains themselves and again, there was no mission, it said i was on a mission, but it didn't show me a waymarker, way point, or a quest explanation. Nothing at all! 

So i was hoping that by skipping Cetus and not clicking it but the other nodes are much the same as before I beat Vor. That was what I meant by if they are similar. 

Another question haha. How do I go about building reputation with Cetus and Fortuna without playing them?"
Warframe,fed6m0b,t1_fed5mrg,1579001374.0,"Thank you! So essentially it was just chance that the first node I picked after beating Vor happened to be a confusing massive open world segment primarily for non-noobs to expand their Warframe experience? So I can ignore clicking Cetus and just click on the other Earth nodes and the gameplay loop will return back to normal?

This helps a lot! Are all the other nodes similar to the previous ones in Vor's Prize where it's essentially missions?"
Warframe,fed6dck,t1_fed5pwp,1579001061.0,"Okay! Makes a bit more sense. And I don't mind a gameplay loop like that but there needs to be a loop! For me there was no loop after beating Vor. Before Vor there was a loop, after Vor it has me doing nothing. Even on the Plains the only enemies seem to ignore me and barely take any damage if I do try to fight there. So I don't even have enemies to grind towards loot anyhow. I'm very frustrated. It's like a big empty world now and all I can do is stare :("

battlefield_4,fdulc68,t3_en3dwp,1578734741.0,"join an EU server and just deal with lag, it honestly only rears it's head during intense graphical firefights. I'm US yet I play Russian and UK servers a lot haha"
battlefield_4,fdujc9r,t3_en0nle,1578733960.0,Love it haha xD. What gets me is when I forget Transport Choppers can't get one shotted via a free aim rocket and my perfectly lined up shot merely glances off the choppers hull and they either crash themselves or just bail out. We should get the kills for the subsequent crashes xD
leaves,fdna7o3,t3_em5thq,1578581340.0,"I fully understand that quiet calm. It's funny really, before getting sober I always assumed that weed helped me loosen up and relax and just flow, but now sober I realized that when I'm high on weed or therein my emotions are entirely more turbulent than when I am sober. 

One second I can be happy and laughing and then the next I would get news like, ""Your Site Manager is changing and a stubborn older lady who has never touched a schedule in her life is taking command of the site."" and I'm like, ""the world is ending, i'm trash, life is trash, bullet please enter through my mouth and exit wherever you will!"" 

But when I'm sober, about 3 plus days in, I'm like, throw anything at me, I've got this.

My mental state is so much more even sober! It's like a steady, solid line up into happy or slowly down into upset and worry. Feels nice. :)"
dyinglight,fdkzo80,t1_fdk5rox,1578514445.0,And this is why you are an amazing person  xD Don't ever change! NPC LIVES MATTER!
leaves,fdjzu05,t1_fdjyoue,1578492482.0,"r/Petioles is exactly the sub that is about Moderation and Occasional Usage of Weed. An amazing sub like Leaves, but be cognizant that for most of us here on Leaves, moderation and self control is not a viable path. Too many years have gone by with me quitting for a few months, then thinking I can smoke just once on the weekends or once a month, and then the very next morning I am waking and baking and then a whole month or year passes where I haven't spent a single full hour sober. Sometimes it truly is all or nothing."

getdisciplined,fd1ukc2,t1_fd1ub2j,1578137041.0,"Essentially, the mere act of sitting down and just trying IS the power you gain from meditation. Regardless if thoughts arise in your mind, it's the fact that you try to mediate that will provide the true benefits of mediation  :)"
getdisciplined,fd1sunt,t1_fd1qkh7,1578136275.0,"Hmm, Doing nothing is not difficult at all! I think people have told you some lies about meditation. People think meditation means clearing your mind of thoughts or something. That isn't true. You cannot achieve this and maybe that is why you are finding it so hard? 

Mediation is not making your mind empty and thoughtless, it's about letting your mind be a mind, thoughtful and cycling around like rabbit, but learning to not allow those thoughts to actually take a form in our reality. You may want to punch your boss in their mouth but instead you smile, hop online, and look for new work. 

It's not difficult to truly meditate. All you need to do is Observe your mind at work. Observe the thoughts as they race across your mind and then give them no power. Through that action you will find real power.

Example: You sit there, eyes closed, Observing and feeling your breath In and Out. A thought comes into your mind, ""I'm really hungry now, maybe I should eat, Hmm, what sounds good?"" And instead of continuing to think ""Oh yes what do i have for food in the kitchen?"" Instead of that, just continue to feel your breath going in and out. The thoughts will disappear and be replaced by new ones. ""Oh the tip of my nose is really itchy!"" or ""I wonder how much time has passed."" The thoughts will manifest, all you need to do is look at them aka ""Observe"" and then go ""Meh. Cool thought. But this breath, this is some good breathing.""

Mediation is about not letting your thoughts and emotions control  you and teaching yourself how to just Observe them and not Follow them. So that one day, a person is yelling at you and making threats and instead of acting on emotion and hitting them or something you will instead take a breath and be like, ""I understand your qualms, lets figure this all out."" Meditation isn't about clearing your mind, It's about not letting your already filled up mind dictate how you will act."
getdisciplined,fd1q62l,t1_fd00xfr,1578135085.0,"Don't control your thoughts! Simply Observe your breath going in and out. And if thoughts flit up into your mind, hear them, see them, Observe them with no judgement or power, and then just let them disappear while you return to Observing your breath.  Every time you return to your breath you will have ""won"" and you'll  have grown stronger. :)"
Petioles,fcmjybw,t1_fcm4gos,1577778346.0,"I love my Pax 2 but there are  many better options for same price or even cheaper and more efficient. I would do some research on your needs! For me, while my Pax 2 is not the most efficient, it's hyper concealable and I smoke right in front of my bosses and it looks like i'm just vaping off a nicotine vape. That can't be said about most other Dry Herb Vapes on the market. 

It also has tons of little minigames on it to play! Like Simon! And various party modes that when in the dark of a room and high enough make me feel like i'm on low dose MDMA and enjoy a personal light show :)

 So for the price, I would say it's not worth it unless you can find a clean and undamaged floor model at a smoke shop, then they can give you around 50 percent off. But make sure it's undamaged as i got a davinci this way once it pieces were rattling around the inside and blehh, not fun when you scorch your palm on an open channel. 

So yes Pax 2 looks great, can be found cheaper, looks like an Apple Product, but it truly earns it's rep when it comes to concealibility. You can even wrap a set of headphones around it or a phone charge and it looks exactly like an MP3 player or a Portable Charger haha"
Petioles,fcjma4j,t3_ehir8b,1577693593.0,"Withdrawal Sucks! But here's the way to squash it and feel like a million bucks every day!!

1. Exercise hard! 
2. Eat very clean. You can splurge on like Muchas Gracias Burritos and stuff after the gym but stay away from processed foods and sugars like pop tarts and pretty much anything that is boxed, packaged, or labeled. And stay away from fast foods, especially Pizza.
3. Maybe even trying IF (Intermittent Fasting), it's super easy and healthy, just don't eat 4 hours before bed and don't eat 4 hours after waking up and you'll have naturally fasted for 16hrs total and it's crazy healthy. Like the healthiest thing humans can do, period.
4. SLEEP! Sleep optimization is key. I know it can be hard, but for instance, read before bed using your lamp plus a hard copy of a book. Or use your phone/device and set a bluelight filter to negate the insomnia it can cause, and just settle your mind for the night about an hour before your actual bedtime.
5. Supplements that have already been suggested can work wonders on top of those other 4 things I mentioned, but they can only go as far as to compliment an already healthy lifestyle. But they do indeed help! Take 1mg or so of Melatonin. Like 3 dollars at Walmart. Research the other supplements before purchase. Things like Valerian Root are great but do your research! For instance, 5-HTP is great as well for Happiness and Sleep. But without Green Tea Extract, it can pool in your heart and cause Valve Damage. Not fun. So research! Melatonin is very safe but doses of above 3mg are not recommended and usually useless.
6. NOVELTY!! Novelty is key in life, especially when withdrawing. Learn something new!  Get excited about something! Find a book series to fall in love with! Start writing your own novel! Fall in love with a TV Series to gossip about. (My wife never shuts up about Grey's Anatomy and I too enjoyed it as a teen before realizing Med-school was not for me. Writing stories is.) Novelty is key to motivation and ambition and creativity. When you have a passion filled day you find yourself ready for your relaxing time to ponder and eventually the beautiful sleep that follows.

Hope this helps!!"
