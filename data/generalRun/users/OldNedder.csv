The cat won't be intimidated by their size, and most of the smaller dogs were bred for companionship.   Some mixed-breed rescues would do just fine in your situation, and you'd be able to test them with a cat before adopting them.  I have a 50-lb mixed rescue, and she's barked maybe 3 times in the past year.  She will lie around and snuggle with us all day, but I take her outside 1-2 hours every day to walk/explore.  For many/most dogs, getting outside to explore the scents, and meet other dogs/people is the absolute highlight of their day - you don't want to deny them the best parts of their short lives.

Be aware that many breeds come in very different breeding lines.  A labrador retriever, for example, typically is available in sporting/American and show/English lines.  Both make nice companions, but the sporting line requires extreme amounts of mental and physical stimulation compared to the more docile show line."

Galileo was convicted of heresy for thinking the Earth orbited the Sun, which the catholic church did not approve of.  A special Earth would not be orbiting another body, according to the church.

Unfortunately (for you), not only is the Sun a run-of-the-mill star, but most other stars have planets orbiting them, too.  The Milky Way alone has about 250 billion stars.  So we're talking about something on the order of a trillion or more planets in just one galaxy.
