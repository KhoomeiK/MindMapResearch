Darkest Dungeon is a much longer game, with vastly more complicated resource management where you'll have dozens of things you *could* do at any given time but you need to figure out how you're spending those limited resources. Also, maintaining a stable of heroes is a lot more complicated, time-consuming, and error prone than keeping your deck tight.

In the end, though, this question is just... bizarre. Why would you even compare these two games? It's like asking if XCom or Path of Exile is more complicated. They're not remotely similar. They're not even similar as roguelites; Slay the Spire has you start off from square one every game, and anything you unlock just increases the variety of things you'll encounter. Darkest Dungeon is 100% about meta progressioin. I don't even know if you can lose a game of DD. I guess if all your heroes die and you can't afford to hire any new ones?"
