disney,ffg8reo,t1_ffg775n,1579900903.0,Ah yes! Thank you for clarifying the bus system from Disney springs! I forgot it only went to resorts then to the parks - I just remembered it took forever when we did it this way but not why it took forever.
disney,ffg4mq6,t3_ete4rn,1579898357.0,"I'll admit, Disney World IS going to be very expensive. There's definitely ways to save costs, but it'll require planning on your part. 

Travel: Driving is a great option to save costs on plane tickets, but keep in mind if you want to drive you'll have to pay for parking fees. If you stay on a Disney resort, it ranges between $15-25/night. If you stay at a non-Disney hotel/location, but plan to drive to the parks, you'll have $25/day parking fee. If you're looking to really cut costs, you can drive to Disney Springs and take the free Disney shuttle to the parks (but this is very time-consuming).

Hotel: Staying on a Disney Resort will give you major benefits (extra magic hours, dedicated shuttles to the parks and back, magic bands, 60-day Fastpass reservations), but will cost you more than a lot of nearby hotels. You could also look into Disney's Good Neighbor Hotels which get *some* of these perks, but aren't actual Disney Resort Hotels.

Dining/Food: Reserve your dining early. You can book dining reservations up to 6 months out so it's important to know which parks you plan on going to on which days so you can book accordingly. Hangry people are not happy people. You can also bring your own food and drinks into the parks - which is a great money saver since food/drinks in the parks are very pricey.

Fastpasses: If you're on a Disney Resort or a Good Neighbor Hotel, you can book your FP 60-days in advance. Otherwise, you can book them at the standard 30-days. Look into the FP tier system for certain parks - as it will prevent you from booking multiple ""Tier 1"" rides on the same day. Although, once you use up your 3 allocated daily FP, you can book them individually.

Disney App: Download this! It makes booking dining, FP searching, and navigating so much easier. You can also link your family's tickets so you can have one person taking care of everything for everyone.

Either way, best of luck!"

I still think you’re NTA because she clearly had the opportunity to tell you how she felt beforehand and she can’t hold you responsible for not being able to read her mind. Plus, you reached out multiple times to check in. BUT, if she HAD told you beforehand and you still went like you said you would have, I’d lean a little towards calling you a slight AH."

Some tips:
Download the Disney app (Disneyworld/Disneyland). It makes booking, traveling, and finding events/locations so much easier. It can also double as your ticket if you forget your magic bands/entry cards (just remember in sync your ticket in advance).

Book your restaurant reservations ASAP (you can book them up to 6 months in advance). I’ve seen many a breakdowns from stressed parents who can’t find any place to eat for their tired and crying children.

Fast passes are a must if rides are a majority point. Disneyworld introduced a tier system for rides in each park which restricts the number of “tier 1, 2 or 3” rides you can book at once. Know your ride tiers and choose accordingly. You can also use the app to check wait times so you can get an idea of which rides typically have the longest lines to book fast passes on those.

The day you get there, go to the nearest Walmart. There’s a super Walmart about a 15 minute drive away from Disneyworld. BUY WATER. Trust me, you will not want to be spending $5 per water bottle while your trapped in parks/the surrounding Disney-owned areas (the “Disney Bubble”). They’ll let you bring your own water and snacks so make sure you bring enough to last you the day.

If you need more tips/any help, I’m happy to answer. We frequently go to Disney parks so I’m happy to share what we’ve learned over the years!

Although I want to say that getting engaged is only supposed to be between two people and their love for each other, I feel like you need to consider we simply live in a time where social media and taking photos to document memories is largely the norm. 

I’m going to assume your affections for each other is not being questioned here and you both love each other enough to still get married. I get that planning a executing a proposal is nerve wracking, but the fact that she told you ahead of time that she wanted photos of the engagement should have told you the importance of it to her. She seems to have a vested interest in photography so it’s natural that she would want photos of this once in a lifetime event. If she tells you something is important/holds meaning to her, you need to actively listen and make decisions based what you think is best for both of you.

What’s done is done, so there’s no point for either of you to hold onto the negatives during this happy time. Why don’t you compromise and suggest getting a professional to take engagement photos? You could even joking reenact the proposal as an inside joke between the two of you."
