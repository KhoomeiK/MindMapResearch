AskReddit,fh7kwi1,t1_fh7jgvy,1581336496.0,"Try this recipe:

6 oz penne pasta, 2 cloves garlic, 1 pint grape tomatoes, 1/4 lb mushrooms (easily optional), 1/4 cup kalamata olives, 1 oz parmesan (I like the shaved flakes), 1/8 tsp black pepper, 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 tsp Italian seasoning.

Cook the pasta according to box directions (aim for ""al dente,"" you really want it to keep some body). While the water is coming to boil, wash and slice the tomatoes into halves, long way. Wash and slice the mushrooms. Mince the garlic.

Heat the oil in a skillet or saute pan, then cook the garlic and crushed red pepper until fragrant (~30 seconds). Add the tomatoes, mushrooms, Italian seasoning, salt and black pepper. Cook until mushrooms are tender and tomatoes are juicy and starting to break down, about 3 minutes. Add the cooked pasta and the kalamata olives, toss to combine. Serve with parmesan garnish.

The tomatoes will cook down and intensify in flavor, on top of breaking down into a lovely light sauce to coat the pasta. Since the ""sauce"" is so much lighter than just a dollop of normal sauce over pasta, the acidity is a welcome element, you don't need to (or want to, IMO!) try to balance it with sugar."
