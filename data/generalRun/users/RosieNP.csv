EDAnonymous,ff8rv57,t3_esaagr,1579693622.0,"No one will judge you on your weight. Most people with bulimia, for example, are normal weight or overweight. True story. 

I think you should go to the doctor but be aware that unless they have experience with EDs they may not know much about how to help you (and you should have help). I would recommend seeing a psychiatric provider, ideally one with experience of EDs. If you're in the US, you can find providers on psychologytoday.com.  Or you can tell your regular doctor and ask for a referral to a psychiatric provider.  

And remember: you ARE valid. You do have an ED; the only question is which one (which is just a category for psychs to group your symptoms in). Formal diagnosis or not: your problem is real and you shouldn't have to struggle with it alone."
EDAnonymous,ff8rklo,t1_ff7xhoz,1579693260.0,"I don't think you're wrong. I think it is easier to be lazy and not give a diagnosis and then have to think about evidence based care for that diagnosis. 

I also wondered if many people would say something like what you said: that the diagnosis can be self-reinforcing. I think it's obviously very important, if a diagnosis is given, to stress that this is a current diagnosis and that it will hoped change and that it should be a wake up call, not a life sentence. And I think referrals to a nutritionist and therapist are important.

EDAnonymous,feeygsm,t3_eorx35,1579043985.0,"I'm 38. I developed an ED in middle school but I wasn't really too ""into it"" until I was 20. Then I started restricting and purging regularly and the shit hit the fan. Its not even that I lost a lot of weight (statistics suggest that the average bulimic is actually overweight), but I was obsessed and did little other than binge and purge. I ended up reluctantly inpatient and it was the best thing that could have happened. At first I fought recovery, bit when I looked at my quality of life, I knew things had to change. 

The thing I had a hard time wrapping my head around was this: though I didn't want to gain any weight... once I stopped binging and purging, I also stopped obsessing about every calorie and ounce I ate, and then I started feeling so much better than I *truly* didn't mind being a normal weight. Even though I fought it at first, my life was SO much better in recovery and with a recovered mind, I didn't care about my weight as much.

Now I know that's hard to imagine, but many, many people in recovery would swear it's true. And for me, that was it for 15 years. I was ""recovered."" 

But recovery is active. It requires staying vigilant and getting help when you slip. I ignored my recovery and eventually, I slipped back into it when I was too busy with life to feed myself properly. I'll tell ya, it took almost zero time to go from healthy to underweight. I had to do an IOP program. Me, a mother of two and a nurse in her mid-30s. It was humbling. Since then, recovery has been a struggle. After IOP, I was still too busy to take care of myself, but this time I ate (in the name of recovery). I gained a decent amount of weight... And then I sort of gave up. And here I am. 

But my advice is this: if you want your life to be better, you need to recognize that losing weight won't fix things. Recovery will fix things. There is no weight that can make you happy, but having a life that is focused on things other than weight and food will allow room for happiness. 

And recovery requires you to take care of yourself; no one will do it for you. And I gotta tell you the truth: if you don't care about yourself, no one else will. Sure, maybe your parents when you're young, but everyone will eventually give up on you. In adulthood, no one wants to take care of someone who won't take care of themselves.

So don't give up on yourself. Take care of yourself. Give yourself a chance for a normal life before it's too late. When you're young, people care enough to work hard to get you healthy... Years from now, people won't be so sympathetic and you'll be on your own. So do you want to be alone with your eating disorder, or do you want to have a normal life focused on friends, family, traveling, kids, and a good career? Because it's your choice. Completely your choice."
