Next you're gonna tell America is a Hwhite country, aren't ya? I can already tell what profile of white conservative you are."
news,ffo552i,t1_ffo46t5,1580074286.0,">Hmmmm, maybe because life is fucking tough for most white males?

Demonstrably not any tougher than most other non-white males, yet despite making up ~ 30% of the US population, white men are responsible for over 70% of suicides. Is there something uniquely affecting these men that isn't afflicting other, often poorer groups of men?"
news,ffo3tlo,t1_ffnv9w4,1580073826.0,Very well. Gonna go brainstorm some theories as to what it is about whiteness that has your men leading the field in suicides (and other neurotic manifestations). I'll let you know if I come up with any concrete.

None of them seem to be afflicted with these so-called ""deaths of despair"" that are causing white guys to disproportionately drop like flies?

That sounds like that was an incredibly pivotal point in your life.  I hope things worked out in the end. 

Sidenote: have you ever thought about where your upbringing (and the eventual life it would come to inform) would be had you **not** gotten the help that you did?"

TopMindsOfReddit,ffa0olu,t3_esfa4v,1579725516.0,"The FBI outright fabricated things to smear people with. The only source for MLK jr being an alleged ""serial adulterer"" are these same devils who employed all manner of tactics to assassinate his character before his untimely death at the hands of a white supremacist. I dont believe a damn thing wrt any files the FBI has on MLK. 

Funny how white conservatives (the ideological - if not biological - torch bearers of pro-Jim Crow Americans that despised MLK during his lifetime (which was the majority of the white population) are clinging onto to this tidbit of propaganda to further cast aspersions on his character. Fuck, these people make it so easy to hate them."
