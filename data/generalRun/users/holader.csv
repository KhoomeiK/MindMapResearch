fo4,ffdwc86,t1_ffcbt4w,1579830547.0,I swear I get game crashing CE errors pretty much daily. I starting a survival mode boosted me lvl up to 18 only to die when I ran into the door of that car between red rocket and sanctuary. Killing all my progress. Sure it may not be as bad as other you mentioned. 4 is the only fallout I've played so I don't have a comparison. But this game is extremely buggy.
