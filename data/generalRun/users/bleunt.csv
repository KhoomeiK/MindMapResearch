They probably do worse things. And a lot of them die. You must have lived a very protected life. 

>As for the humiliation aspect, many street performers or entertainers humilate thmselves for a living. Thats their choice, and there is nothing wrong with it.

I refer you to my previous post, that pointed out the difference between doing something because it's what you do as a job and doing something because you won't have food and shelter if you don't. Stop comparing what they make these homeless people do with regular jobs, as if you're too dumb to grasp the difference. You're not that stupid. 

>As for the final point, I fail to see any reason why a job must he ""needed"" (I don't think the vanity of a nicely trimmed lawn is a ""need"" but okay). You could pay them to recite lines into the camera or pick their nose. Would that be exploitation?

If you don't see the difference when it comes to having someone cut your lawn and having someone eat a frog, then you're beyond hopeless and I'm wasting my time here. 

>In a market economy if there is demand for something someone will eventually meet it.

I didn't think you were going to go there since I called you out on being a zealous libertarian putting capitalistic principles above the morality and dignity of man before you even went there, but there you go. Your view of fellow humans is psychotic. We're done here. I'll give you the last word."
todayilearned,ffly6sc,t1_ffllwnq,1580045601.0,"OK, I'll explain the difference between paying someone to cut your lawn and what Bum Fights did, since you're either unwilling or unable to figure it out. 

First off, the person cutting your grass can decide not to cut your grass if you're an asshole to them, and still have plenty of opportunities. Him cutting that one lawn will not make a whole lot of difference overall, and he will most likely still have food in his belly and a roof over his head that night. 

Then we have the humiliation aspect, that is missing from your example. For your example of cutting a lawn to work in this case, you'd have to add something that dehumanizes the worker. Asking him to cut it naked, or asking him to also cut himself, for example. 

Then we have the third difference that you could not figure out; the profit aspect. Bum Fights didn't pay them to eat a frog because they needed their frogs eaten, so it's not the same as paying someone to cut your lawn because you need your lawn cut. The eating of the frog is not the end goal, which is the case of getting the lawn cut. No, the end goal is filming the eating of the frog to then sell that video to profit greatly -- much more than you invested by paying the person to eat the frog, and without sharing the profit. 

So to summarize... Finding someone who greatly depends on your money so that they might not die, then offering them an exclusive opportunity to do dehumanizing things, and finally filming that act and selling it to ear thousands and thousand of more money than they recieved, is profiting off of misery and dehumanizing vulnerable people. Three different and very important factors distinguish it from ""cut my lawn and I give you $50"". I'm surprised you could not find even one of them. Probably because you don't want to. 

Your view is a very zealous form of libertarianism where capitalism justifies antyhing by its mere presence and we don't need unions because ""hey if people agree to do it then it's OK for those with money to treat the takers of the lowest bid however they want""."

Studies who a lot of women have rape fantasies. They would reasonably get off on a visualization of that fantasy. Does that mean they have an actual urge to be actually raped? 

>Believe it or not, getting off on the idea of raping someone = bad and inherently harmful.

Hey, look at that. Everything you say can just be changed with murder or any other crime/behavior common in entertainment media/fiction.
