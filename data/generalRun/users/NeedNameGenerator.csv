WinStupidPrizes,fgoxy42,t1_fgnuvhs,1580991316.0,"I mean I _sort_ of get when healthy people are against seasonal flu vaccines, or vaccines against some sudden public scare diseases such as the swine flu.

For example, at least in Finland, when swine flu vaccine was rolled out, it hadn't been tested as thoroughly as it should have been (naturally, as time is of the essence). This then led to a bunch of people getting narcolepsy from the vaccine.

This only applies to these special cases though. I'm vaccinated, my child is vaccinated and I wouldn't have it any other way. I just understand why some people are hesitant to get some vaccines. 

But the vaccines talked about in here are so thoroughly tested and proven effective, that there's really no excuse to not take it. Especially when the person at the receiving end of the needle could literally die without the vaccine. And people working in healthcare should be 100% vaccinated 100% of the time. They're working with people who have weakened immune systems etc. It's just reckless endangerment to not vaccinate in that sort of situation."

politics,fgmz0nx,t1_fgmwtjv,1580934636.0,"I mean the older people get, the more out of touch with the struggles of younger generations (whose future they are shaping with their decisions) they usually are, and further, they are more susceptible to ""old people"" diseases such as Alzheimer and dementia that can go from 0 to 100 real quick. 

Of course there are exceptions, and many a grandmother spends their days online etc. but still, the world is changing faster and faster, and that requires faster and faster reactions to these changes. Older people more often have the ""more of the same"" attitude towards whatever happens, and while there are times when that kind of calm and cold reception to change is good, there are also times when it can be really perilous.

Furthermore, I'm not even 30 and I feel I have no connection to the world of current year teenagers. The environment (both physical and virtual) I grew up in was completely different to theirs. So I just have hard time believing a dude closing in on 80 could be really aware of the current zeitgeist.

That all being said, if I was a US citizen, I'd be making damn sure to get as many people as possible to vote for Bernie."

PublicFreakout,fglmo82,t1_fglesj4,1580904592.0,"I'm sure Trump personally was. As you may have noticed about his ""illegal votes"" and ""look at this completely red map"" -comments, he clearly cares deeply about being the most popular.

It's just that his campaign staff was smarter than that. Not to mention the conservative media.

Then again, rather paradoxically, I also subscribe to the theory that he wasn't intending to win at all, and just wanted to use this as an opportunity to boost his Trump TV plans."
