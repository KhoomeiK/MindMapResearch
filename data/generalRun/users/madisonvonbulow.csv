fragrance,ffpitki,t3_euf9qg,1580096070.0,Abercrombie and Fitch Ezra Fitch and Abercrombie and Fitch Fierce!  But my first fragrance was Davidoff Cool Water. I was 11 and living in France.
BipolarReddit,ffklqqp,t1_ffi1u04,1580024843.0,"Everything. Now my episodes are longer and more severe and there’s a bit more disassociation with the mania and (trigger warning) when in the past I used to want to hurt /end my life I would get to a point where I could back my self off the ledge where as now I feel like I could easily move in the wrong direction.

As I’ve gotten older (I’m 29 now) I’ve gotten more and more helpless. I used to be considered “high functioning” because I was working and in school and independent and now I feel like I need help getting out of bed."
tax,ffkl4wb,t3_eu2i1z,1580024568.0,"I have the same situation. I filed independently as I am single and while last year’s return was way more than my usual, this year’s ended up having me owe a whole lot of money. This was expected when the Tax Reform passed a couple years ago. I don’t make all that much and there is no reason why I should owe but this year I owe.

fragrance,ffcx43x,t1_ffcuhwt,1579809090.0,Yesss Guerlain Vetiver is a fav of mine!
fragrance,ffcx195,t3_esvykv,1579809044.0,"I have a bunch but L’Occitane has their verbena and Lavender sprays that work pretty well as fragrances and fresheners. 

I wish a bottle of Chanel or Calvin Klein Obsession was in every bathroom. Also Issey Miyake is always a good choice. 

If budget isn’t really an issue than anything by jo Malone!  I love the Lime and Mandarin."

fragrance,ff5fepp,t3_eroij7,1579590500.0,Very nice! I can tell you like musky florals! I have a couple of those including the one direction one! â˜ºï¸
BipolarReddit,ff5fciz,t3_ernxer,1579590429.0,I was 22 when my symptoms worsened and then at 25 I knew something was very wrong. And thatâ€™s when I was diagnosed. I always thought I just use suffered from depression and then life was good when I wasnâ€™t depressed but there was a lot more brewing as I got older. I will addd that my symptoms have continued to get worse as Iâ€™ve gotten older but what has helped the most is noticing and observing those symptoms.
fragrance,fe5l2na,t3_ennwra,1578870823.0,I work with younger people that are trying to get into perfumes and I give a lot to them.
fragrance,fe5kzqh,t3_ennwra,1578870784.0,I like to give mine away to people or use them as air fresheners around the house. I have sooo many that Iâ€™ve been using them and not rebuying since theyâ€™re pretty expensive.
bipolar,fe002uy,t3_encbw8,1578799850.0,Yessss! I hate that everyone says they are because it devalues the sickness. People always say theyâ€™re bipolar or get diagnosed with â€œmood swingsâ€. I have so many friends that are like â€œomg I think Iâ€™m bipolar too!lâ€ when really they need to stop the drug use. Mania doesnâ€™t feel like cocaine and a weekend of binge drinking is not bipolar disorder. ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»
fragrance,fdpkojv,t3_emgubx,1578631278.0,"Iâ€™m very particular.

I hate white musky florals and I hate aquatics. Sadly I canâ€™t wear alot of menâ€™s frags because they are just too nauseating for me. I also donâ€™t like the peach notes in a lot of womenâ€™s perfumes. 

I think the worst fragrance I have ever smelled from a big designer is the Gucci Memorie dâ€™un Odeur. Iâ€™m sorry but for some reason it makes me so sick and brings a visualization  of an old dusty trunk from a traveling carnival cirque 1908.  I really was excited for it but then I ran to the counter to smell it and gagged. I really liked Gucciâ€™s Bloom but the Tuberose makes people complain of a fecal smell when they wear it and Iâ€™ve picked up on that a few times. 

I do love gourmands and rose fragrances. I also love spicy fragrances as long as they have something to ground them. In the summer I wear citruses but again, I like them to be grounded with something and not just lemon and musk. 

I have a lot of favorites but I do like Jo Malone Rose and Oud, Prada Candy, Tom Fordâ€™s Tobacco Vanille, Noir, Cafe Rose, and Grey Vetiver. I also like Frederic Malle and a few of the Guerlain fragrances.  I have a very large collection so when it comes to fragrances, Iâ€™m a total slut... but I have a type.

Ps... I loooove Vetiver fragrances! I like Vetiver over citrus."
fragrance,fdpj8xh,t3_emg4qp,1578630114.0,"Depends on the fragrance. But yes the more â€˜grandâ€™ fragrances make me want to dress up. 

I have a lot of these that are a little bit more dressed up and I love wearing them. The Original Miss Dior, exclusive time Sakâ€™s Fifth Ave., is an older more dressy fragrance that I like. 

I also like Chanel no. 5 and Coco Chanel for this reason.

Also the Original Dior Sauvage smells great for this kind of effect! 

I have so many but those are some that you could get."
fragrance,fdpivpb,t3_emfjyl,1578629824.0,I love Britney Spears Fantasy! Itâ€™s so synthetic but Iâ€™m a guy and I get so many compliments from it! And itâ€™s super cheap!
bipolar,fdpi87x,t1_fdmux0p,1578629324.0,Yes Iâ€™m definitely going to try to be sober for a while. Itâ€™s just cost me too much money.
mac,fdms1lz,t3_em2fj9,1578562943.0,I have the same one! It has high Sierra on it and I out 8gb of ram and a ssd and itâ€™s my daily driver! Works great! You can defiantly still use it.
drunk,fdmryav,t3_em32zs,1578562813.0,Awsome to hear! He cute!
bipolar,fdmrw1d,t3_ejtf04,1578562726.0,Haha I was saying this too! ðŸ™ðŸ¼
bipolar,fdmqz7k,t3_eimzob,1578561454.0,I hate being sick because my bipolar acts up and I go crazy! Itâ€™s the worst thing ever and I get the worst anxiety around work. I hope you feel better soon!
bipolar,fdmqsqq,t3_em6tmp,1578561206.0,Thanks Iâ€™ve been on meds since early October. I think I need a led change so Iâ€™m glad Iâ€™ll be seeing my doctor soon. Thank you.â™¥ï¸
bipolar,fdmqiou,t3_ekk034,1578560811.0,"I am so sorry this is something youâ€™re going through. I currently work part time at a job that I find very difficult latley and I worked full time for about six weeks but quit because it was too much.

I would say reach out to resources maybe through your doctorâ€™s office. My doctor is out of Northwestern in Chicago and they have groups and stuff that I should really participate in. Also community centers and stuff should have resources.

I have also thought of maybe trying to get disability. It would kill me but at least I would have some money despite my bipolar being at its worst depression itâ€™s ever been in right now.

If you need any help let me know. Hope you feel better soon. â™¥ï¸"
fragrance,fdmpzn9,t3_elzakq,1578560074.0,"I found the exact item. They used to have cool colours too.

fragrance,fdmpvbl,t3_elzakq,1578559910.0,IKEA used to have a really cool metal medicine carbonate that had glass shelves in it. It looked very cool. In just display mine on my dresser then in my bathroom on the counter as well. I have fragrances everywhere.
fragrance,fdmppvl,t3_em0ieq,1578559705.0,"In west something every day. I have some for light use and every day like a lighter EDT for work and then I have some for special occasions during the day and some for nights out and then winter vs. springs summer l. Iâ€™m crazy but you can find yourself one that you really love and make it a signature that you wear everywhere or even under another fragrance. 

Iâ€™m a guy but my everyday and under spray is Chloe EDP and Roses de Chloe.

Usually a lot of the sport ones can do the trick like Chanel Allure Homme Sport smells great anytime on a guy."
fragrance,fdmplbf,t3_em3mo3,1578559535.0,"I had this issue too and I found the ladies dove sprawled work really well. Iâ€™m a guy but I use the rose, clean, and beautify scents do the trick and tend to not distract or overpower my fragrances. All the stick deodorants were just too strong for me. I used to use the dove I scented but cannot find it anymore."
fragrance,fdmpcc7,t3_em5x7a,1578559200.0,Iâ€™m a guy and I wear the EDT and people compliment me all the time but I never really know when to where it. I have to be in a mood and usually dressed up.... wearing a sweater.
BipolarReddit,fdmows2,t3_em6bzf,1578558620.0,I sadly have stopped taking my meds because they make me sick and make me miss my mania. I have a doctor appointment next week and feel guilty so Iâ€™ll probably start taking them for that reason. Hope you feel better soon. Hugs! â™¥ï¸
fragrance,fdd1g7x,t3_ekhugt,1578291014.0,"I looove all the Opiums and frankly, I wear more womenâ€™s fragrances than menâ€™s since a lot of the menâ€™s tend to smell the same lately."
bipolar,fbxc4uh,t3_eeyq0c,1577179489.0,"Iâ€™m sorry to hear. I know what youâ€™re going through as most of my family doesnâ€™t believe it or care enough. 

Try finding a support group that can maybe talk you through it and give you the support you need when the parents arenâ€™t able to."
