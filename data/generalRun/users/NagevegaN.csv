But as we're learning the hard way, when there's a ""Democrat"" in office, the anti-war movement goes virtually dormant, greasing the wheels of the war machine; and when there's a ""Republican"" in office the anti-war movement comes back to life, slowing the wheels of the machine a bit.  
I'm not saying to vote for one or the other, mind you; I'm saying that the antiwar movement has developed a severe malady that it needs to rid itself of."

They, believe it or not, care about garnering public support, or at least establishing a believable illusion of public support, for their attacks/invasions/coups.  
They've been having increasing difficulty in that area now that there's a 'Team Red' member in the White House, and the majority of the public is suddenly willing to call bullshit on the claims of warmongers.    
Actions against Syria and Iran have been delayed as a result.  
As soon as there's a 'Team Blue' member back in the White House, things will go back to being butter smooth as the majority of the voting public goes back to believing every bit of bullshit their eloquent-speaking team leader delivers."

lowendgaming,fdktl52,t1_fdjnetb,1578510878.0,"I guess that's up to each person, their needs, their tolerance for planned obsolescence, their tolerance for waste and the amount of money they have to spend.  
I'm still using electronics from the 70's, 80's & 90's.  
All of my gaming consoles still work, including my NES, and if they fail, I'll do my best to get them working again.  
  
_Most_ electronics devices that fail, do so because of some degree of planned obsolescence and it is often the case that not all components in the device were designed to fail. In fact it is often only one or two components that are designed to fail.  
If you can identify those components and replace them, your device could last for decades more; especially if the replacement component was produced with longevity in mind rather than timed failure in mind.  
  
Unfortunately, manufacturers are increasingly moving away from component-failure planned obsolescence and towards programmed obsolescence. For example, power supply manufacturers now install IC chips in their PSU's that can be programmed to kill the device after a specific amount of on-time has passed, which also permits them to easily maintain the _'you get what you pay for'_ illusion, as they can program a $60 PSU to die after 5 years and a $160 PSU to die after 9 years (even though they both may have had an actual lifetime of 20+ years). This programmed obsolescence will make it very difficult (if not impossible) for the average Joe with a soldering iron to combat planned obsolescence and keep their devices alive."

lowendgaming,fditam3,t1_fdimepu,1578450554.0,"This is correct.  
It is primarily hardware from 2006 and earlier that may have the electrolytic capacitors notorious for failing that I'm referring to. 
From that point on, manufacturers increasingly used polymer electrolytic capacitors that are a great deal less prone to failing.  
  
You can typically tell the difference just by looking at the capacitor.  
The non-polymer (""wet"") electrolytic capacitors have [vent lines](https://i.imgur.com/mIagn0Z.png) on their top and the polymer (""solid"") electrolytic capacitors have [solid tops](https://i.imgur.com/Tb2DRHJ.jpg)  
  
Is is possible for a wet electrolytic capacitor to have a solid top if its capacitance is below 300 microfarad (300uF) but that low of capacitance is uncommon for motherboard capacitors.  
   
Polymer (""solid"") capacitors can, of course, fail as well but they are extremely less prone to failing, so if you're experiencing weird problems (like those mentioned in my OP) and your board has polymer capacitors, the culprit is far less likely to be the capacitors."

The Moon is nearly exactly 1/400th the size of the Sun.  
The Moon is positioned nearly exactly 400 times closer than the Sun.  
This is what allows the Moon to appears nearly exactly the same size as the Sun when viewed from Earth.   
  
A person can immediately dismiss this as coincidence if they want, but that just shows how desperate they are to retain their cozy mainstream-academia-friendly world view.  
  
The reality of the matter is that it is **more** likely that the Moon was built/shaped and/or positioned by an intelligent entity.  
  
The Moon likely originally served the purpose of a solar shield (for temperature control) or a solar reflector (for lighting the dark side of the planet), but the original orbital timing was lost (perhaps because of comet strikes) resulting in only occasional intended alignment."
