When i was young, i didnt want to be touched constantly. My mom did this and now I have issues with receiving affection from her others. She still violates me and emotionally abuses me to this day. 

But when I would reject my mom’s constant touching as a kid, she would tell me “fine, i’ll just find another child to love” and this really messed me up. She did it for years and this translated into her also telling me “im only in this state because of you” and “youre the reason im suffering through _____”

Unfortunately death is a part of life. Just know that your grandad is no longer going to suffer from anything after he passes. He will be free from this brain hemorrhage.

Grieving is a tough process, so allow yourself to go through it. At the end, you will be able to go back and appreciate every aspect of him. Youll remember all the good times you had with him, and remember what an amazing person he was.

Happy new years lovely stranger. It will be ok."
offmychest,fcolcda,t3_eia3pt,1577835126.0,"I hate to say this but a lot of people who are all about body positivity end up leaving that frame of mind when they see themselves heavier than theyd like to be or not as healthy because of their weight.

I get that we might not agree on the whole “body positivity” thing but at the end of the day, you need to do what makes you happy and healthy. From your post you made it obvious that you are no longer happy with how you look. A lot of people wont accept it right away, but deep down **change** is what will make them happier.

Loving yourself means to treat your body well... after all, it works hard to keep you alive, so why not feed it healthy foods? You will feel better physically, and you’ll also be happier knowing that you like the way you look and how you feel.

After all, the only person that will be with you forever is yourself. If you dont like how you look, you have to live with it.

I got chubby over the course of a year or so and was ashamed. I was told to love my body, who cares, you just have to love yourself, etc. I would agree with these things, but when I looked in the mirror, I hated how I looked. So I decided to change. I lost all the weight and eat healthier now, and I couldnt be happier. 

Best of luck my guy :)"
offmychest,fcokm9r,t3_eia78w,1577834603.0,"I have an uncle exactly like this. Although my grandma is now like 90 and he is 60, the family situation has stayed the same since when my dad and his brother were in high school. My dad worked hard for everything... he is a loving, amazing parent while my mom abuses me. His brother steals, gets DUIs, refuses to work, and still lives with his mom. Any letters we send get thrown away by him so we have no contact with my grandma. It’s sad because shell probably die and we wont find out for months, if not longer.

I guess the only advice i can give is to know that you cant change people. Your brother is a shithead to put it nicely. But unfortunately i dont think there is anything you can do, except maybe call CPS for your niece."

I lost 35 lbs in about 6 months (but i only wanted to lose the 35 bc if i lost more i would look emaciated) and I have to agree that 700-1000 is very low... but honestly, I feel like for some people, the extreme is necessary to actually lose the weight.

I am a person that struggles with stress-eating so I had to stick to a very strict calorie intake. Eating only 800-1100 cals every day was the best choice for me and it paid off, had no bad effects, and is still paying off to this day.
