SuicideWatch,feypt5x,t3_eqxl6x,1579448946.0,"Hello.

If you died than your father would be very sad, I'm sure he would be sadder to lose you than to lose the things he has worked for. Also, your father has been working to build his relationship with you something that has been going on for a long time and, if you were to die, he would lose that as well. 

Instead of dieing, look for work so, that you can have money to pay off the debt. Hope this helps."
