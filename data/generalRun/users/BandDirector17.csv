politics,fg7smbb,t3_exbqjm,1580600447.0,"""As worry spread throughout both NWS and NOAA, agency forecasters and scientists feared retaliation if they contradicted the president by providing accurate information about the deadly storm""

Let this sink in.  We now prioritize the retaliation of the president over providing accurate information.  How bad must his toddler tirades be if indisputable facts cannot overrule thin skin?"

Ask yourself why would this person deliberately put themself in a situation destined to fail over and over again.  Then pretend to offer advice to that individual.  If that advice doesn't start with, ""What are you doing?"", consider different advice."

TooAfraidToAsk,fdq9r8p,t1_fdprowf,1578660472.0,Because www.jwfacts.com is organized by ex-JW’s who can accurately speak to both sides.  They explain the reasons why JW’s believe certain things using the Biblical passages and Watchtower literature and also why many of those things are (they believe) utilized incorrectly.  It addresses the controversies over the years which current JW’s would know nothing about.  Long story short: it is far from a one-sided site.
TooAfraidToAsk,fdpeygt,t3_emb4g5,1578626890.0,I very highly recommend www.jwfacts.com to learn about why certain things are the way they are in that religion.  The site explains so much of the concepts driving them by quoting Watchtower literature.

Nearly all of them began to see a flaw in their leadership, not the doctrine.  Once that crack opened, the dam burst.  The portrayal of the person in this article leaving is pretty accurate."
