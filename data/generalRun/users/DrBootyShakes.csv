Hillary was the reason Bernie Sanders never made it into the primaries in 2016. 

The reason Trump did so well, he coated his lies in a robe of truth.

Mitt Romney was a better choice than Trump by far. I voted for him. I think the reason so many people support Trump, is because he says hes for the people. I wasn't upset that he won over Hillary. Hillary was clearly the greater evil. I am just dissapointed that Trump never really pulled through for the people of this country.

We need a better life for the people of this country. I don't think we have a better chance to make a change than this years election. Who knows if we will ever get another persidential candidate that isn't a corporate shill. 

I hope that Sanders wins, because it would mean an end to slave labor and fake news that is bought by corporate entities. Corporate tax evasion will be abolished and better energy programs that will create thousands of jobs for those who deserve them."
