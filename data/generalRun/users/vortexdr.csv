funny,ffh2jps,t3_etbf18,1579921382.0,Yikes that's some terrible training. I can do the same with a tiny piece of actual meat and my shepherd will grab it gently...this is just wow...
food,ffgdotm,t3_et85s6,1579903934.0,"So apart from stealing a picture, you do realize that recipe is far from a Carbonara right? 

To start with ...bacon has no place here and it should be Guanciale but I suppose you can get away with Pancetta. Moving along there is no milk in Carbonara, its all eggs plus pasta water.

And then lets finish it off with not using Pecorino Romano."
food,ffgd9e4,t1_ffgauk2,1579903666.0,That's is literally like a three bite portion...get the fuck outa here.  Besides looking at the meat i don't think he even used guanciale so once again fuck off.

todayilearned,fekzc98,t1_feku257,1579210744.0,"I don't really want to get into it but I don't think any army as a whole is innocent in any war (that's why its called war, it ain't all fun and games). 

The Soviets also had more than their fair share of atrocities. The English as well with for example the bombing of Dresden. Are you American? Do you think the US was totally innocent in Vietnam and didn't commit any war crimes? You do realize it wasn't just the Wehrmacht that raped right lol?

All i can really say is that my grandpa was a 17 year old boy and no teenager should have to see the things that he saw."
todayilearned,fekmker,t1_fekkv4k,1579203170.0,"He was 17, got drafted and didn't really have much of a choice. But both my grandfather and grandmother had nothing good to say. It's worth remembering that most German soldiers are just like any soldier serving these days and a tiny fraction of them would even be members of the party or have much of a clue of what was going on behind the scenes."
