aww,ffz05en,t1_ffyfcwg,1580359782.0,"Downvote for the dramatic end here, but upvote for “dogs can occasionally eat pasta but shouldn’t as it’s essentially super junk food” which would have been a better received, less pedantic way to word it."
Cringetopia,ffyyvlq,t1_ffyeixl,1580358732.0,"I didn’t expect it to gross me out as much as it did, but I gagged so hard I almost choked trying to stifle it"

I’ll be saving for Vancouver all year."
Cringetopia,ffyvf04,t3_evu9c7,1580356118.0,Like this is one of the least appropriate things I’ve ever seen on LinkedIn.
Cringetopia,ffyv6xm,t1_ffx1zkq,1580355956.0,I also thought “die” there...because I associate Scream with death

UpliftingNews,ffyrv7b,t1_ffyjjpr,1580353606.0,"My grandma got a similar call. She was told my little brother had been in a car accident in South Carolina and had hit and killed a pregnant woman, and that he needed money for a lawyer. She was suspicious, but shaken up. She called my dad to come over with my grandpa (they were at work; my grandparents own a company) and asked where my brother was. Dad said my brother was at home (he lives with my folks, as he’s a college senior), getting ready for his shift at work. They had grandma so shaken up that she made dad CALL my brother, ask him where he was, and have him assure grandma he was home (many states away from SC, in the Midwest). 

She deep down knew better, but getting the call with what sounded like my brother crying in the background got her. They even made excuses for why he would call grandma instead of my parents. I can’t describe how angry the whole incident still makes me."

lululemon,ffwle1d,t1_ffwjulb,1580304636.0,"Weird questions (because I work in paid search):

Was it the first AD, or organic (not ad)? And what did you search? 

If it was an ad, I can pass that along to my google rep and they might be able to ban it"
justneckbeardthings,ffwl6pz,t1_ffwj6pi,1580304471.0,The opening line is “I used to manage a store.” Did you even read it?

fatlogic,ffvn3ri,t3_evap0l,1580268031.0,This reminds me of the old anti-tobacco ad that replaced “smoking” with “farting” in sentences.
OldSchoolCool,ffvmzb6,t1_ffvk9ii,1580267947.0,Thank you for clarifying!
