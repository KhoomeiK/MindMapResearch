Also, I’ll be petty: a woman as ugly as he is would have never been able to get a career as a make up influencer but since he’s a man, he gets multiple free passes."

GenderCritical,ffbri50,t1_ffbff12,1579779894.0,"It’s even more insulting that it’s listed right after African Canadians and Indigenous people. Are they not... a visible minority, too? They might as well have said ""... and all other races"", their underlying meaning was so obvious. 

(Disclaimer: ""minorité visible"" is a term we use a lot in French Canada and it’s accepted and not used negatively. I’m not sure it translates well and if it doesn’t, my apologies. I say that because for example, Indigenous people DOES NOT translate to French. Calling Native people ""Indigènes"" is like one step removed from ""savages"")"

fatlogic,fe91llr,t3_en9y8m,1578933229.0,"I watched a video from a vlogger yesterday who's been noticeably gaining weight over the months (and blaming PCOS exclusively) and she was trying on clothes from Aritzia, a Canadian brand now available in the US. Now, as a Canadian, I know that Aritzia is small. I'm a 8-10 in most places, but at Aritzia (if I could afford their clothes, which I can't anyway) I would be a size 12.

This vlogger was *outraged* that the size 12 didn't fit her, because 12 was her usual size. That made me realize how much the US has shifted their sizes faster than the rest of the world. From my perspective, she would be at least a 16, maybe an 18. But she wears a US size 12. She had her friend, a US size 8, try it on, it fit her, and they both went on a rant about how that made no sense and was so bad for girls' self esteem.

So now, reading that a US 14 is the new average... I despair."

When I was fat, I thought the pain I felt was hunger, so I would eat more. I used to say I had a stomach of steel and could eat anything. Now that I've got Thin Privilege(TM), I recognize that my stomach is a dainty elderly lady who may or may not tolerate a banana first thing in the morning, depending on,  I don't know, the cycle of the moon or the atmospheric pressure. So, yes, objectively, it sounds like my health is more complicated than it was when I was fat but it's because I am more in tune with my body."

GenderCritical,fdk6jxj,t1_fdk2dzo,1578497222.0,"De Beauvoir’s whole point was that nothing about what is expected of a woman is natural, it has to be learned while men are allowed to exist in their natural state. 

But, of course, she’s being misinterpreted to mean that anyone can become a woman. Their mental gymnastics never fail to baffle me. She’s literally saying that there is no innate nature of being a woman in the sense of gender roles. It’s right there!

She says she feels really alienated from other women with PCOS because the community is rife with fat logic, it's all about rebelling against being told to lose weight to ease the symptoms, and that's just not something she can do. She has no weight to lose to reverse symptoms. She has nowhere to go to be, like, ""hey, so, I'm infertile right now, maybe forever, and it's a tragedy for me?"""

fatlogic,fdhlnrz,t3_elcpmx,1578425282.0,"Went ham during the holidays. People just kept leaving bowls of chips and plates of chocolate lying around, unattended. Ate my entire weight in bread, daily. Y'all ever heard of a kouign-amann? It's puff pastry made with bread dough, so bread dough stuffed with butter and sugar. It wasn't pretty when I was left alone with a whole pie plate of that.

I gained 5 lbs which is not terribly bad, and I'm already down one so it's definitely mostly water weight, but god. I'm pushing myself into a loose Whole30 (I'm not about to start panicking because my prepackaged sausages have breadcrumbs in them) so that I can get a handle on my sugar-and-bread consumption and lessen my cravings. I made pretzels at 2am during the holidays, guys.

It got so bad from November to now that a colleague, while complimenting me on my overall weight loss, also said ""I'm surprised because I saw you eating so much chocolate lately."" Yeah, I know, lady. I was falling back into my old habits. 

So loose Whole30 for this gal, gotta get reacquainted with my friends the veggies."

GenderCritical,fcxnmym,t3_ej8q9m,1578067231.0,"To me it screams of the social sciences fighting tooth and nail to sound authoritative in the world of academia. (This is not a dig at social sciences, I have two degrees in social sciences field)

The trend in academia to write in as complicated a language as possible to, perhaps, mimic natural sciences is such a vector of exclusion, to use their own words. It’s people in their ivory towers writing about the lives of marginalized people (BODIES) in a language they can’t even understand, ergo it is not for them. It is only about them. It’s Malinowski writing ethnographies of South Pacific Islanders without actually getting their voices on paper. It’s pseudo-intellectual jargon used to lend credibility to their nebulous theories. 

Also, Foucault is overrated, Derrida was a mistake, and I’m glad I did women’s studies 10 years ago and not today."
