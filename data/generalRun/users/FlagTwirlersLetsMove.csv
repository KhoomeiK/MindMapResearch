CollegeBasketball,ffghut8,t1_ffg1tgz,1579906580.0,We have one of the biggest fan bases in the country. We’ve been waiting to be obnoxious for years.
news,fffgc8y,t3_etbvqb,1579883352.0,There aren't only 800 cases of this. It wouldn't be spreading so far internationally if there were only 800 cases of this.  How many people travel from Wuhan to Chicago in a two week span? Somebody representing 0.007% of the city's population has to make the trip.
Browns,ffd7l3d,t1_ffd6p33,1579814969.0,I don’t think it matters what we wear when we win. I’m a younger fan and I think I’ll have fond memories of those uniforms whether they’re modern or classic.
Browns,ffd6gxq,t3_esvy9c,1579814353.0,I’m ok with primary brown and white uniforms if they’re a classic look. I doubt people would be begging for orange if we would just win some games.
todayilearned,ffcds7c,t3_esu6wl,1579797285.0,Most stories about Nero are made up.
todayilearned,ffbtpvg,t3_esrew3,1579782400.0,So one can conclude that the team behind Plague Inc. purposefully starts global epidemics in order to sell their game.
VoteBlue,ffbpv8g,t1_ffbccu7,1579777755.0,What Republicans? The ones in the middle of nowhere that don’t even control a third of the state?
MapPorn,ffbpmi7,t3_esn8vj,1579777408.0,Illinois is transitioning to $15 minimum wage at a rate of about a dollar a year.
Games,ff9l2kv,t1_ff8w7rl,1579715260.0,"I'm also not a fan of having no legislature to worry about, with it being abstracted towards political capital. If social democrats control the legislature no amount of accumulated political capital will allow you to destroy public healthcare. It'd be more work to simulate gaining a majority to pass a bill, but it'd be a much better game."
MapPorn,ff8z3ft,t1_ff8nlq5,1579700607.0,There are so many ethnic groups in Africa though that it's not really practical to divide it into that many countries. Europe got homogeneous nation states because of the World Wars and then a period of forced migration afterwards. Obviously that's not desirable so Africa's in a weird state where it has to make multi-ethnic states work.
Browns,ff8ler2,t1_ff8fbrs,1579684211.0,If you have no expectations you can't be disappointed. If you believe the hype you're set up for terrible disappointment. Either way if they win you're happy.
Browns,ff7yhp4,t1_ff7v354,1579661380.0,You don't get far in football without really loving it.
CollegeBasketball,ff7xorb,t1_ff7uq8k,1579660823.0,Somebody has to lose a bunch of conference games. There aren’t enough wins to go around for 12 teams.
shittymoviedetails,ff68c3u,t1_ff67yaa,1579621520.0,Every fantasy story requires a bit of internal consistency. It’s good for powers to be defined so every conflict isn’t solved with some new superpower that breaks previous canon.
shittymoviedetails,ff67xme,t1_ff679ot,1579621258.0,You’re wrong. In A New Hope they spend time on the falcon traveling to Alderaan. In The Phantom Menace they spend time on the queen’s ship traveling to Coruscant.
shittymoviedetails,ff673t0,t1_ff66qy6,1579620702.0,"If you made a movie set on Earth and everything generally looks the same except that cars go 300 miles per hour, it'd probably be good to explain why."
shittymoviedetails,ff646u5,t1_ff63w72,1579618699.0,I'd be fine with that if it was presented better. As of now it's a big change with not a lot of explanation. It has to make sense why there was this massive change between the originals and sequels when there wasn't between the prequels and originals.
Browns,ff60hji,t3_eruu1k,1579615960.0,How did he run into him at the airport? Did he track his plane?
shittymoviedetails,ff5ws78,t1_ff5s3vx,1579612857.0,All of the sequel movies are too worried about meta commentary like this and not worried enough about telling a story that makes sense from an in-universe perspective.
shittymoviedetails,ff5ow5g,t1_ff5f1if,1579603884.0,Also they pretty much teleport through hyperspace now. The original trilogy and prequels did a good job making it feel like travel took time. The sequels have people travelling across the galaxy in 30 seconds.
Games,ff5m1so,t1_ff4ycj9,1579599567.0,"Pretty much everyone in America is a football fan. (The top 3 most viewed tv programs in 2019 were all football games). Football fans want to be able to play as their favorite teams. The quality of the game doesn't really matter they'll make money as long as they have the exclusive license.

And the NFL will always give out the exclusive license because Madden being a juggernaut is good for them."
todayilearned,ff3jwkg,t1_ff3j968,1579542619.0,Maximum lifespan is the same as it's always been. Doesn't mean your odds of getting there are the same. The last 100 years of medical advancement wasn't all to save babies.
todayilearned,ff3il5g,t1_ff3g6qm,1579541811.0,Yeah 80 is too high. A quick look at Wikipedia suggests someone in Rome who made it to 20 had a life expectancy of 50. Overall life expectancy being 20-30.
todayilearned,ff2szln,t3_erapuy,1579522873.0,Sounds fine to me. The chances of SETI ever hearing anything are astronomically low. Government funds should be spent on more practical space missions.
Browns,ff2erc0,t3_er97hj,1579503106.0,As always context matters. 49ers didn't get their starting quarterback on the field until this year.
Browns,ff1yrul,t1_ff1yhae,1579489295.0,You go all in when you have your core. It happens all the time in baseball.
Browns,ff1wead,t1_ff1quk7,1579487697.0,There’s no way Moneyball tells you to get rid of your young core and rebuild while your QB has a rookie contract. We rebuilt last time because we had nothing. Now is the time to contend.
BikiniBottomTwitter,fenbgpx,t1_fenbdfy,1579281109.0,In my opinion there’s still enough inequality for any voting restriction to be problematic.
BikiniBottomTwitter,fen7nga,t1_fen7byr,1579278756.0,Funnily enough history class in school taught me why literacy tests are a terrible idea.
BikiniBottomTwitter,fen6sv2,t1_fen5irt,1579278233.0,In my experience conservatives are much less likely to appreciate the value of the core subjects taught in public school.
BikiniBottomTwitter,femxegv,t1_femwzti,1579272097.0,"Well there is a high profile impeachment going on right now, so knowing about the last two times it happened (and Watergate) would be valuable. 

History is about understanding cause and effect. The emphasis shouldn't be on memorizing who the 3rd president was. It should be on understanding how his ideology and actions impacted the present day."
BikiniBottomTwitter,femw1ez,t1_femv8hc,1579271101.0,"Problem is between the core subjects, a foreign language, gym class, and lunch there isn't a lot of time left in the day. There are good reasons for schools to encourage all of those things.

I think the best solution is to focus on that instead of economics in general, which was mandatory for a semester at my school. Then again I can see how macroeconomics is important so who knows. There's lots of things schools could teach and they don't have all of the time in the world to do it."
BikiniBottomTwitter,femq203,t1_femjtg7,1579266234.0,"Good luck getting a job or doing taxes without knowing basic arithmetic.

What do people want cut from the curriculum? Math is vital. Science is vital. English and rhetorical skills are vital. Understanding history and geography is vital. Most of the problems in our society can be traced back to the voting public not knowing these things."
boxoffice,felyg0x,t1_felckc9,1579234150.0,"If people didn't like the movie right away the Imperial March wouldn't be everyone's go to villain song and ""I am your father"" wouldn't be everyone's go to example of a shocking twist. And Yoda speak wouldn't be a thing.

That whole movie is iconic and that doesn't happen with people deciding it is 10 years later. Maybe some critics didn't like it but audiences did."
MapPorn,fejevnr,t1_fejd3d0,1579170765.0,"I'm willing to believe that a more well off and educated population will eventually move past that phase and demand reform. Maybe not in the next 10 years, but I bet in 100 years China will look very different."
Browns,fejduex,t1_fej06lx,1579169196.0,Something was off starting with the third preseason game.
MapPorn,fein5o3,t1_fehdnvc,1579142434.0,No because federal law requires there to be majority minority districts.
Browns,feibr1f,t1_feibazq,1579134794.0,Give them a share of revenue. Let them profit off of their own official merchandise sales. I’m not a fan of them being able to be paid by boosters because it’s so easy to abuse. At least cap it at a limit so you can go to lunch but you can’t get paid six figures to sign with a blue blood.
Browns,feia909,t3_epb0cv,1579133790.0,"Even if you disagree with the rules it’s irresponsible to knowingly break them like that. Now LSU and its student athletes are in trouble because he acted without thinking about the consequences.

Besides there are very good reasons why boosters can’t just hand out money to players. If they’re allowed to be paid eventually it should be done in a more regulated way that protects parity."
CFB,fei9513,t1_fei3wye,1579133058.0,Even with a rule change it should be done in a way to minimize the advantage for big money programs. If what Obj did was ever allowed it’d be a massive recruiting advantage.
CFB,fei8lhq,t1_fei0ot4,1579132704.0,Maybe because the rules aren’t being enforced right now.
BikiniBottomTwitter,feg2145,t3_eoz4xg,1579073506.0,Or they were purposefully reposting for karma.
Browns,fef3irh,t1_fef3460,1579047321.0,"Does anyone seriously believe we lose to Pittsburgh, Arizona, and Cincinnati if it wasn’t the end of the year with Garrett suspended and the team giving up on Kitchens?"
Browns,fef339p,t3_eou1qf,1579047033.0,Continuity is valuable in its own right. We had a perfectly serviceable defense before Garrett was suspended. If the offense plays to its potential we can be a playoff team with last year’s defense.
Browns,fee7lsm,t3_eom57z,1579028056.0,I guess everyone here is ok with cheating. You can disagree with the NCAA rules but while they exist they should be followed. Otherwise schools that don’t have an unfair competitive advantage.
CFB,fecqrbt,t1_fecocil,1578981147.0,Wrigleyville when the Cubs won it all.
CFB,feclt2m,t3_eogbh0,1578977081.0,As a Browns fan this is the last quarter I can enjoy Joe Burrow.
CFB,fecji8j,t1_fecjfwk,1578975427.0,Spread offenses. QB’s break records all the time now as offenses continue to innovate.
CFB,feciz97,t3_eofoct,1578975065.0,By rule there was targeting. Targeting is a bad rule.
CFB,fecgoif,t1_fecgm8o,1578973482.0,I don’t think so. Red Grange basically started the NFL with his star power.
CFB,fecge2n,t1_fecg93c,1578973278.0,150 years of college football and you’re going to put 3 players from the 2000s?
CFB,fecg43q,t3_eofn0v,1578973088.0,Seeing a lot of recency bias in the reactions. Have to remember that stats are inflated nowadays.
Browns,fecduif,t3_eoe4o8,1578971563.0,I’ve never seen anyone like Burrow.
Browns,feca6t5,t1_fec9y5s,1578969428.0,Probably because everyone is getting their information straight from Breer.
Browns,fec9na4,t3_eoeroa,1578969125.0,I’m done listening to people who are clearly biased against the decision we made.
Browns,fec8g1j,t1_fec546r,1578968471.0,He never looked bad in this game. No separation by receivers. A very effective blitz that he’s doing ok avoiding all things considered.
CFB,fec7dke,t3_eoehbi,1578967923.0,More Burrow bombs please
CFB,fec5fgy,t3_eocu5w,1578966922.0,Burrow is the only LSU player who looks good. Plenty of accurate throws just no separation.
CFB,febyo3n,t3_eocu5w,1578964378.0,SEC fans being Trump supporters explains a lot.
PrequelMemes,fe6wlhs,t1_fe6e0ng,1578906626.0,I probably heard that line of dialogue a million times because I was too bad at games to get past Kashyyyk and would start over.
boxoffice,fe6t9lv,t1_fe666in,1578904389.0,Spongebob fans aren't interested in new Spongebob. It's all about the first three seasons.
Browns,fe5t90k,t1_fe5t07n,1578874437.0,Sounds like a good idea for the GM or maybe Depo. Haslam doesn’t need to be that involved.
Browns,fe5ljzd,t3_enut20,1578870972.0,Did everyone forget Garrett was out for several games? Of course the defense sucked. The first half of the year it was fine but we had no scoring.
Browns,fe5fs2m,t3_ensifm,1578868903.0,What if KC blows a 17 point lead?
Browns,fe55jy8,t3_ensifm,1578865826.0,On second thought let’s not go to the playoffs. ‘Tis a silly place.
CollegeBasketball,fe447b2,t3_enrmor,1578855660.0,Ok then
Browns,fe40d0v,t1_fe40467,1578854594.0,Shurmur is a good coordinator and if Obj is that bad at getting along with people maybe he is the problem.
Browns,fe400v4,t3_enramh,1578854504.0,Making the decision based off one game would be idiotic when the 49ers defense is vastly more talented than the Vikings offense. That game was won and lost in the trenches.
Browns,fe3yo9q,t1_fe3uiig,1578854053.0,"We’re trying to win games, not make people happy."
Browns,fe3xmh6,t1_fe3vti3,1578853805.0,We can be a great run first team. That’s enough to make the AFC Championship and beat the Ravens now.
Browns,fe3salu,t1_fe3lvza,1578852391.0,"3 losses to the Ravens, Seahawks, and Falcons. 2 of those teams are better than the Vikings. For their talent level they may as well be unbeatable."
Browns,fe3qb8l,t1_fe3p5jq,1578851838.0,That sounds about right. But he seems happy here and not like someone looking for another opportunity.
Browns,fe3p00y,t1_fe3of3z,1578851488.0,He’s upgraded the talent level but his defensive scheme has serious flaws. When it gets turnovers it works. When it doesn’t it’s really bad.
Browns,fe3obwu,t1_fe3n6rd,1578851271.0,Take it from an Illinois fan that you don’t want Lovie and I don’t think he wants to go anywhere.
Browns,fe3mtdu,t1_fe3lexk,1578850754.0,Who did? The only experience McDaniels had of those two things was failure.
Browns,fe07bkh,t1_fe05red,1578804961.0,"Texans could very well play them next week, so it’s not like they’re suffering."
worldnews,fdzko7m,t1_fdyfvkl,1578791142.0,It's not too far off what Trump campaigned for.
Browns,fdzel4s,t1_fdzccyp,1578789484.0,Baker isn't ready to play that big of a role. But yeah get a good OC.
Browns,fdz8h2s,t3_enflmy,1578787693.0,I’ve edited Hue Jackson’s wiki page before. It doesn’t mean anything.
Browns,fdysyhh,t1_fdyrrox,1578783284.0,The 49ers are one of the league's best defenses and Kirk Cousins kind of sucks.
Browns,fdyrrbc,t3_endtjd,1578782880.0,The Niners defense is unfair.
Browns,fdvqclo,t1_fdvq6wf,1578750270.0,We were tanking on purpose.
PrequelMemes,fdvp00v,t1_fdv0jif,1578749889.0,"Didn't all of Episode 9 take place in a single day? The amount of traveling that takes place in that movie is ridiculous, especially considering Lando's trip to the core worlds."
EmpireDidNothingWrong,fdvfbmj,t1_fdv8mqr,1578746800.0,Well considering this is /r/empiredidnothingwrong...
Browns,fdtf5ra,t3_en2k86,1578715878.0,If our media doesn’t have anything to report they shouldn’t report anything.
Browns,fdtcmay,t3_en2e2e,1578714853.0,It flew pretty close to Boston. I don’t think that’s a coincidence.
Browns,fdtadvy,t1_fdt9f7v,1578714004.0,I like Depodesta and want to see what he can do given control of the process for once.
Browns,fdt95zm,t1_fdt8j98,1578713549.0,That’s something the search committee would be able to judge better than us. The fact that they like Stefanski so much suggests to me they know something we don’t.
Browns,fdt746j,t1_fdt6en6,1578712788.0,The fact that we wanted him last year too suggests that there’s more to it than him being a successful coordinator.
Browns,fdt5m3w,t1_fdt55sk,1578712219.0,Are we unorganized or are fans just upset they aren’t getting what they want? This whole process has seemed very organized to me. We’ve interviewed everyone and now a decision’s coming this weekend.
Browns,fdt2n1b,t1_fdt1h7s,1578711119.0,I really don’t understand the hate for him or for analytics. It comes across as people just not understanding what it is.
Browns,fdt2cl5,t1_fdt18bp,1578711010.0,"Sean Payton, Andy Reid, and John Harbaugh were all successful at their first head coaching job. Those are the first three I looked up."
Browns,fdt0tvd,t1_fdt0nyc,1578710455.0,First time head coaches have worked before. We can’t immediately rule people out because they remind us of Freddie Kitchens. That’s overreacting.
Browns,fdt0iek,t1_fdt0biy,1578710340.0,Pettine was a classic case of a decent coach given a terrible roster.
Browns,fdt0ap6,t1_fdt000v,1578710263.0,I think Stefanski and Saleh will be good head coaches if we hire them.
Browns,fdszh1o,t3_en1aru,1578709956.0,When did our fan base decide to lose their minds if we don’t get McDaniels? There’s lots of good coaches we’re considering. Some of them might work better with Depodesta.
Browns,fdsfc1d,t1_fdsewxw,1578701453.0,Or they’re going somewhere else to pick up our next coach. (Probably not)
Browns,fds670i,t1_fds5mzl,1578695256.0,One weekend won’t make a difference. There’s no more interviews we’re going to discuss things and have a head coach soon. All that happened was we didn’t go into the process targeting McDaniels. It’s an actual search.
Browns,fds5w8s,t1_fds5gmg,1578695060.0,Watching a football game you can see good or bad performance with your eyes and on the scoreboard. Here we’re assuming good or bad performance based on our opinions. We’ll know if we made the right hire when we watch the football games.
Browns,fds4xjr,t1_fds4qld,1578694442.0,That’s why we’re not rushing to a decision this time and trying a different process with Depodesta at the lead.
