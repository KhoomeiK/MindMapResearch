I mean in fact In what you have provided you supplied like 3-4 examples of why he isn’t a narcissist.  Maybe he is controlling? But that doesn’t imply he is a narcissist. 

Maybe you are better off? But what you said doesn’t imply that he was a toxic person for you."
offmychest,fez2sup,t3_eqwcv8,1579453339.0,"So this fella, gave you advice to not put all your money in a depreciating liability? He then complemented you because you had a horse and the car you saved for(hopefully).  I’m not really in agreement to not invest in yourself I.e. horse lessons. And I’m assuming told you to not be a dispatcher and was hoping for you to pick a more lucrative life long career, which if you are happy to do so by all means. From what you said just sounds like he wanted good for you. 

I don’t know. You didn’t really make any case for a narcissists as their goal is to make you feel like you need them and to make you feel weak and helpless, sounds like he spent a bit of time trying to help you get on your  own feet?

Either way, if you are happy that’s all that important, but I would probably revisit why you are making an ode to the world about self empowerment and referencing this man."

One of the biggest misconceptions to me is that time heals all wounds. If someone has their arm ripped off, they don’t grow another arm. They learn to live without an arm and the rest of their life will be impacted negatively because they don’t have an arm. The only exception is Some people may find inspiration in this event, but I think we could agree that having two arms would be better. This is all a play on the metaphor. 

People experience absolute devastating events and that is all relative to the person. We as people allow a certain amount of time to get over it and then we expect that person to go back to the live we had. There are events that happened in my life where if I focus on that event I can still take myself back to a bad place mentally. 

To pretend like our childhood doesn’t effect us as an adult is ignorant. Now, maybe I’m wrong here, but it sounds to me like you haven’t really processed the events that happened to you l. I would guess that these events still effect you in parts of your life where you haven’t been successful. 

I can struggle with relationships. I don’t tell my friends and girlfriends it’s because of my childhood and run a pity parade, but to ignore what happened in my childhood or to expect no sympathy if I explain to people why I am the way I am Is equally as bad. 

Corey Taylor; lead singer from slipknot, stone sour: molested, father abandonment, etc. As an adult seeks therapy because he acknowledges his childhood effects the way he adapts to the world today. It has effected his dependency on drugs, his music, his relationships. You are not stronger than Corey Taylor. 

Mike Tyson, about the same as Corey Taylor, just more extreme. You are not stronger than Mike Tyson

The list goes on. 

I would suggest to you showing some empathy when someone is talking about how their childhood has shaped their lives and how it potentially has caused them to do negative things as an adult. We don’t always get over everything. But to your point, we can’t lay around saying whoa is me and expect that people should allow us immunity because of the past. That kind of person needs help processing what has happened to them. 

We can’t ignore how our past shapes our lives today. This is why in every biography there is a substantial amount of information on a persons childhood and why therapist will often target a childhood. That is the foundation for which we build or castles, that is our lives."
Erie,fdosuss,t3_emhbee,1578612111.0,"3-4 weeks is probably good here as well. But I would just go to a website like apartments.com to get a good idea of what you are looking for. There are not as many options for an apartment as in NYC. You won’t have as much trouble with vacancies, as if you pick a few places, there is a good chance you will find a vacancy here. The population in Erie is in slight decline. Hope this helps."
