blogsnark,ffjzht7,t1_ffinpue,1580011243.0,Did Eva originally just trip and land the wrong way? I read that it was a freak fall. I’m so glad to see this support system around her.
thebachelor,ffjaucm,t3_etwjcm,1579994434.0,You can see her left hand the entire time with no ring.
aww,ffgkfrc,t1_fffuen5,1579908282.0,"Meanwhile in New Zealand, they are actively trying to kill all the possums since they’re invasive."
blogsnark,ffgepol,t1_ffflyhr,1579904576.0,Oh so it's a knock off Frankenbag
thebachelor,ffdhlbi,t1_ffdh1zl,1579821031.0,It keeps the cork swelled and your wine nice and sealed!
thebachelor,ffczrko,t3_esylg1,1579810602.0,"I like her social media vibe.  I never thought I would, but here we are."
thebachelor,ffcb9ex,t1_ffbymg3,1579795710.0,My go-to is Veuve.  It's excellent for the price point.
thebachelor,ffcb6ca,t1_ffbo3ge,1579795656.0,"Anyone can sabre if you follow Alton Brown's video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCp9-tEHa8U

It's surprisingly easy and a great party trick.  Personally, I just use a regular sword.  It does work on any sparkling, as long as it has a proper cork with a cage.

However, it will work better with an actual sabre and champagne.  The glass on French bottles is typically thicker and makes for a cleaner cut."
thebachelor,ffcay9a,t1_ffbn8rh,1579795513.0,Wine blogger--I'm cautiously open to it.  They have the climate and soil to plant the types of grapes that thrive as sparkling wine.
thebachelor,ffcav8i,t1_ffbj5of,1579795459.0,"Stepping in since champagne person bounced.

I 100% bet that she did not store that champagne properly.  You want to store bottles on their sides, so that the cork inside the bottle is continually wet.  They should also be in a cooler, temperature-controlled place.  If it was on her kitchen counter, there's a ton of temperature fluctuation that just isn't good for the bottle."
blogsnark,ffb3rxq,t3_ereojh,1579751043.0,Carly posted her empties of beauty products and I was pleasantly surprised to see the Olay Retinol from the sponsorship bonanza on there. It’s nice to see that at least one person was legitimately using it.
thebachelor,ffaqi95,t3_esjutn,1579742122.0,"I found a long sleeve version of the bodysuit at lulus and trust me, I am getting it!"
thebachelor,ff6lk0d,t3_erw7ds,1579629780.0,That explains why she hates all the pageant girls so much. She’s jealous of anyone who’s achieve success in that realm.
thebachelor,ff56t4z,t3_erp9sa,1579581886.0,It’s not even a full bodied white—It’s basically clear.
thebachelor,ff56jc1,t3_erp8rq,1579581654.0,She looks like she hustles but BOY that boutique is my sorority style from 2011.
thebachelor,ff525gb,t3_ermsy9,1579578181.0,Sydney staring Alayah down and asking her if she had a job was the bitchiest thing I’ve seen someone do in a long long time.
thebachelor,ff51v4l,t1_ff4q874,1579577963.0,She just seems very upset at the happiness of anyone else around her. It’s not a good look.
thebachelor,ff4sl5m,t3_erjj7f,1579571441.0,I used to live across the street from here!
thebachelor,ff4sk48,t1_ff45fs6,1579571421.0,It’s actually super gorgeous inside! Also about a million dollars though.
thebachelor,ff4sc4z,t3_ermsy9,1579571265.0,Sydney seems unhealthily obsessed with this girl.
blogsnark,ff4m7yz,t1_ff4k7vl,1579567005.0,"To be fair, I only recommend that movie if you want to be super depressed."
blogsnark,ff4kjb4,t1_ff4k7ha,1579565837.0,"The best part is that the Oklahoma revival is “sexy.”

It’s actually supposed to be pretty good though."
blogsnark,ff4bxld,t3_ereojh,1579560008.0,"Ugh.  In lonestarsouthern's stories, AGAIN with her friend using MLM essential oils on a plane.  And she's encouraging it!  It's just not okay for so many reasons to whip out random scents that can trigger allergies on a plane.

Rant over."
blogsnark,ff3pfse,t1_ff3hvx2,1579546021.0,Well that's gorgeous but must be a bitch to dust.
thebachelor,ff1wfnx,t3_er5rvs,1579487723.0,Did she take this down? I don’t see it on her story anymore.
blogsnark,fewiqu7,t1_fevfgkz,1579411363.0,"I’m painting my kitchen cabinets now and oh boy, it sucks. It sucks so much."
royalfamily,fetim0r,t3_eqkdk9,1579375810.0,This needs to be edited or un-stickied and replaced with a correct post. They are retaining their HRH’s. They will not be using them. There’s a big difference.
blogsnark,fepnqes,t1_feot8qq,1579325445.0,I just watched her stories. She is insufferable.
blogsnark,fennkhy,t1_fenmufu,1579288260.0,That's me!  I may be taking you up on that.
blogsnark,fenmjy9,t1_fembpzr,1579287889.0,"Ooooh, I am super interested in learning about natural wine!  It's such a fascinating field.  I don't think I can directly link to it here, but it's called Becca Drinks Wine.  Very original, I know."
blogsnark,fem2r34,t1_fely3hr,1579237834.0,"France doesn’t really so much sell by varietal, but by region.  Fan of a light white? You’ll order something from Alsace. It’s annoying in that you do need to know what regions are known for particular varietals, but it’s really not hard to ask a waiter or a Somme.  That’s what they are there for—to help pair to best compliment your meal. 

I love wine. My blog is about wine. So maybe I’m biased. I don’t think I am though. She is being ridiculous."
thebachelor,felz7rc,t3_epv88f,1579234762.0,"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes."
thebachelor,fekhsw1,t1_fekhnk1,1579200330.0,"The true secret is to make sure it’s absolutely freezing cold and to not hesitate when hitting the lip. I believe in you!  Plus, how fun would it be to practice?"
thebachelor,fekg0kt,t1_fekf4k1,1579199266.0,"The best way to open a champagne bottle is with a saber and I'll fight anyone who says different.  

Seriously though... Hi from another wine industry person!  I'm starting to study for WSET soon."
thebachelor,fekfwx8,t3_epltyv,1579199205.0,"Personally, I prefer to saber the neck off."
blogsnark,fek8fy1,t1_fej8gz0,1579194781.0,Her AMA here is one of my favorite posts EVER.
blogsnark,feh65mp,t1_fefhek9,1579109954.0,That was a FANTASTIC AMA.  I'd love another one.
blogsnark,fegxhan,t1_fefl3bk,1579104717.0,Woah.  Just googled her and realized she's the green dress girl who went viral like 10 years ago.
blogsnark,fegwnsy,t3_eotrhh,1579104194.0,I think I found GOMI through Carly.  I remember reading through and wondering how they could hate someone like that.  Some of the comments made me sick to my stomach.  Haven't been back since.
blogsnark,fefwf5v,t1_fefesjc,1579067405.0,Reading that whole ad was exhausting.
thebachelor,fecpwes,t1_feckum6,1578980353.0,"Not a knock on the size, more a knock on them looking like bolt-ons (like larger implants over the muscle tend to).  And damn girl, you sound hot! Rock them out. :)"
thebachelor,feck8sr,t1_feck7ow,1578975948.0,I think that was Madison!
thebachelor,feck3x1,t3_eog6e1,1578975851.0,"I don’t like her, but I don’t think she’s a Luke P. However, this really shows that she picked implants too big for her frame. It looks unnatural."
thebachelor,fecj7mw,t1_feciuep,1578975221.0,That was (at minimum) a $150 bottle of champagne she was saving for a special occasion.
thebachelor,fecilc2,t3_eog01o,1578974801.0,Hannah Ann has never actually been bullied and it shows.
thebachelor,fecgxes,t1_fec9i4d,1578973652.0,She can always do catalog.
thebachelor,fecgujo,t1_fecfjse,1578973598.0,"Based on the stuff that came out about her being a bully, I say B."
