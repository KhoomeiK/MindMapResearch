news,ffhtogp,t1_ffh8mpj,1579953361.0,Someone hasn't learned their English. I'm trying to be rather peaceful. Yet you being so proud of the LGBT community has left you to become an arrogant bastard. This is exactly how rifts form. I can basically see a Hitler against LGBTQ people if your so proud and arrogant. Must be nice to be a self righteous asshole. ;)
