FortniteCompetitive,fdngd4m,t1_fdng5tc,1578585227.0,"No no lol, it's not that I dont like the results, I'd prefer it to be that way. I'm just more convinced by Upshall than I am by these two videos. Like in the streamable clips the lower fps snaps sometimes fall abit short. I'm just saying ima need more to go on ya know?"
FortniteCompetitive,fdnfypx,t1_fdnaaqv,1578584982.0,I'm seeing this link a lot and I'm not convinced. The guys testing doesnt seem conclusive enough.
FortniteCompetitive,fdnfjg5,t3_em8i3u,1578584725.0,"Pretty eye opening. Just wanna say. It didnt used to work like this. This is fairly recent. It actually makes boxfighting horrendous at times, not being able to flick at a reliable speed is detrimental. I show my appreciation for trying to being serious about aim assist tho, rather than just posting a useless montage of ppl getting lasered.
      I have one question: while this looks completely broken given the footage shown, what does this look like with a bit of range? How does this work at ranges that people tend to complain about when getting lasered?"
