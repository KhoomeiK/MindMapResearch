todayilearned,feooo78,t1_feongxz,1579303173.0,"Well, it's all about being present in the moment. Nothing else. If you can manage to do that, to be aware of the now, with no distracting thoughts about the future or past, even for a few seconds, it is a very peaceful and refreshing experience.

It's at the same time the simplest and the most difficult task. You sit down comfortably and focus only on breathing in and out, not forcing it, just letting it flow. Straighten your spine, but relax muscles with every breath. Every thought that comes up, label it and let it go. Focus again on the breath.

This trains you to be aware in the moment, not distracted by (often unnecessary) thoughts. Many of those thoughts I view as social programming, not even really your own. 
Repeat every day for 15 minutes. Results will come. Suddenly your everyday life feels different, as you are more aware of things you used to react to automatically. You can then choose differently, this is freedom."

AskReddit,femydx7,t1_femy1l6,1579272788.0,Some do. There's quite horrible shit in the animal kingdom. We just don't find it that offensive because we're not the same species.

I wouldn't go so far, I mean it's not normal until the majority does it. But still, way too common. The worst is how people look away. They look away inside the family, the friends of the family look away too. Even if the secret's out, way too often, nothing happens.
These attackers should be publicly marked and put in a cage in the city square."
AskReddit,femx6co,t1_femvu8r,1579271935.0,"If you think about how prevalent it is, in every town of just a few thousand citizens, there's guaranteed to be at least one family where there is active child molesting going on. It's horrible.
And that's ""just"" sexual abuse, violence and mental abuse is even more wide spread. 
And there's definitely no end, it spreads like a sickness, some victims become attackers later on.

Just a wild, spontaneous thought: would all penetrating mass surveillance and the eradication of privacy solve that? Would it be worth it? There's so much dark fucking shit going on behind closed doors.
How would society react to that, if everyone knew they can't hide?"

Mindfulness,fejit47,t3_epg8aa,1579176099.0,"As you already know, it's an automatic stress reaction to your daily life. I battle with the same problem. What has helped me a lot is take very frequent breaks (every 45min for starters) and either meditate or do some fitting yoga exercises for 10-15 minutes. You might think this will take up a lot of productivity time, but in my experience I'm still getting done the same amount of work or actually more, because those breaks refresh your brain and you'll perform much better.

And also, perhaps try to analyze the underlying reasons for your stress reactions with a good psycho therapist. You can learn a lot about yourself if you're willing."

Meditation,fe6oz0d,t3_ensi2o,1578898756.0,"One of the goals of meditation is to let go of all that. You don't have to perform, you don't have to socially interact in a certain way. Therefore you don't have to think about it either. Yes perhaps it can be a bit disorienting to get out of autopilot, but very liberating.

Watch your thoughts come and go, without identifying with them or acting on them. I found it helpful to just label each thought that comes up, let it pass and refocus on breathing."

atheism,fe251ru,t1_fe0k5id,1578834567.0,"Hell is not real. It's just a fairy tale they hammered into you. Heaven too. Just to control you in this life. 

Better to live this life to its fullest, make life good for other people, so that you can die knowing you lived a good life. No fear, no regrets, just the end. No sequel. Because you made the best of your  time.

If you feel like you are battling against yourself, or need to reprogram or free yourself, it could be very helpful to find a good psychologist. (It's not necessary to be mentally ill to benefit from psycho therapy. Most mentally sane people could benefit greatly.) 
That's exactly what they are trained for to help you with. Making the changes in yourself that you know are hard to do on your own, because we are always partially blind in regards to ourselves. Just an idea."

I recommend reading the stories of the greek and the norse gods. They are very entertaining and very WTF. All of those gods are maniacal tricksters, playing with humans, fucking everything over, for themselves and for everyone.
