MakeupRehab,ffsmzz5,t1_ffsmuzm,1580185870.0,Yeah it becomes addicting very easily and is really hard to break. It really did help me realize it was a coping skill and also a “I want this and need it” thing so its helped me be less materialistic now
MakeupRehab,ffsmvbo,t1_ffsmlgr,1580185763.0,Oop thats an ouch. I do think stealing is trashy but I dont consider my self a trashy person lol. Was just a young dumb kid
MakeupRehab,ffsmpty,t1_ffsmkrj,1580185641.0,I have a lot of mental health issues. But stopping stealing has helped my life in a lot of ways. I’m glad I caught because I dont think I wouldve been able to stop

AmItheAsshole,ffpgnrd,t3_eue1dj,1580094584.0,NTA. They let you play so? If they didn’t want you to participate why would they let you. Also wtf is a 6 yr old gonna do with 40 dollars. AND if they wanted you to let the kid win they should’ve told you that.

unpopularopinion,ffe9311,t1_ffe8xh1,1579840070.0,"Oh I definitely think a lot of times it doesnt work. My stepsister tried homeschool and she did her work but other than that slept ALL DAY and became depressed, and went back to school. On the other hand my bestfriend (who recommended me the program I use) is doing so much better homeschooled. We actually work together so she gets the social part too. I think it turns bad when all they do is homeschool and stay at home. Your points make sense too, especially with people who need that classroom learning experience."
unpopularopinion,ffe8lnl,t3_et54ou,1579839674.0,"Im homeschooled, but I didn’t start until 11th grade so I got the social skills. I also have a full time job so Im social there and have other activities. As for the teacher over computer thing, I think thats agreeable for people who need teachers. Im a pretty fast learner and am actually less bored and feel more challenged in homeschool than I was in public school. And I think homeschooling is really helpful for people with mental disorders (anxiety, depression, ptsd, add, all ones I have). I still learned how to cope with these things in real life settings because I do other things. So I think the key to successful homeschooling is doing a lot of things outside of it and staying dedicated."

Anger,fd6wwaf,t1_fd6wuaq,1578196747.0,Have you talked to your therapist about what happened??
Anger,fd6wog3,t1_fd6wgs7,1578196670.0,"I know it is. Have you ever considered therapy? I know it’s a cliche but it can be really helpful. Also when I lost someone close to me, drawing really helped me so maybe try finding a skill like that? Another thing is get closure from your ex."
Anger,fd6w6jq,t3_ek776m,1578196493.0,"Okay first of all FUCK THAT BITCH. You got every right to mad about that. That was such a shitty thing to do and Im sorry that happened to you, however it’s in the past. I know its hard but you can’t change what your ex did, so try to move on from it. Your mental health and the important process of mourning your mother is worth way more than that sorry excuse of a person. You deserve so much more."
