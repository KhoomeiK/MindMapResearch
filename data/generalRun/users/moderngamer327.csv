>And where do you get that the Empire is doing anything to stop the Dominion? They're the ones who let the Thalmor run rampant in their territory and undermine their retaliation efforts. When Elenwen says heel, Tullius heels. Ulfric on the other hand demonstrated his refusal to be the pawn of the Dominion by evicting Elenwen from the peace summit (which she demanded Tullius to be invited to, and he condescended like a whipped dog).

The reason they surrendered was to win the war. If they didn’t the Dominion would have won. Elves take much longer to mature and ready for combat as such a small break like the one the empire wanted would allow them to amass troops much faster than elves. The ban on Talos was never a serious ban until Ulfric revolted heck even Tulius wears a Talos necklace under his armor. The empire is playing the long game because if they went to war right this second they would lose. Skyrim will also lose if it’s separate from the empire"
