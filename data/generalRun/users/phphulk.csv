>For now it is ok and I donâ€™t want to waste the doctors time with my nonsense each time I freak out over practically nothing. God I hate health anxiety.

No, you are thinking about this wrong. You are the reason doctors are there. You are a human body and mind that is having a fear reaction to a possible threat to it's health. You are resisting getting that assessed by a professional, and that in itself is indicative that you should see a doctor.

Plus it helps to explain this stuff out in front of an authority on the matter, and have the holes in your reasoning pointed out by someone who isn't in a state of heightened anxiety."

Your leg ""numby"" feeling, slap that mfer, you feel the slap? It's not numb. Move on. Dry skin, pinched nerves, who knows.

I go to therapy for my stress and anxiety, and one thing I learned, is that the causes of your anxiety might not be right in front of you, and might be a combination of things. You mention dorm and college, could be from being away from home. 

If you're worried go see a doctor. Write your questions in advance and make sure you get them answered. Once you're clear find a counselor/therapist. You can sprout off how you think you are dying and they will help you sort through that mess and make sense of it.

Once I was able to recognize these thoughts as ""unwanted"" and ""unhelpful"", it became easier to give them less weight and begin to ignore them."
