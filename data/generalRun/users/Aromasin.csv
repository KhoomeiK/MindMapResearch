Here's an analogy. My friend has spent the last 10 years complaining about his computer being shitty. I've lost count of how many times I've told him to just upgrade to a budget computer - but he refuses to buy one until he has enough money to 'future-proof' it. Thing is, he's said the same thing for those 10 years. At this point, buying a £50 laptop from Wish.com would improve his situation. He's crippled by the idea that he might need to replace it a few years down the line, somehow forgetting that his current one is near unusable. 

Any rail route is better than no route at all. The fact you can't get a train from Limerick to Cork is a fucking crime. Just because it might be viable to make that trip 20 minutes in 20 years time doesn't mean we should wait while there's the potential to do it in 40 minutes in 2 years."

Mostly I've found that if I keep a good eye on flights roughly 2 weeks before, they can drop to 25% of the price just days prior. Just a few months back I found flights to Barcelona that fell from £85 to £21. Travelling in Europe can be incredibly affordable if you're thrifty with it.

To preface my comments though, I would definitely recommend taking the train if you're looking to stay within Europe. From my experience, taking the rail is normally more cost-effective, environmentally friendly and infinitely more fulfilling in terms of the views and people you end up chatting to. I recently got the train from London down to Zagreb in Croatia and back for £150, and if we didn't stop off at each changeover for some touristy things it would have only taken us about 17 hours total. Even looking now on Trainline it's pretty cheap. You could leave London at 11am tomorrow and arrive in Zagreb at 6 am the following day for £175 return!"

That's not to say I'm against it, as I believe legalizing drugs would have a net positive societal impact overall, but I know friends that have damaged their brain serotonin neurons from frequent MDMA use. Anyone that has had a comedown knows how shit it can be. Food tastes bland, you end up getting overwhelmingly sad at the smallest of things, and you'll find almost anything someone does annoying. They had to go on anti-depressants, indefinitely in some cases, specifically because of MDMA.

science,ff2hnu5,t1_ff2dg0m,1579506557.0,"I very much know people that drink orange juice straight from the carton like it's water.

In the UK a popular lunch for most workers is a ""meal deal"" from the supermarket, which consists of a sandwich, snack and drink for £3-4. Most people always opt for the juice or smoothie option, believing it's the ""healthiest"" choice and normally more bang for their buck. The problem is, yes, it's packaged with some vitamins, but also comes with the cost of having around 10-20g of sugars per 100ml. That's at least the same as a can of coke, if not twice as much with some. If you're having that 5 days a week it slowly adds up. If you want vitamins, just eat some fruit and stick to water. Then sugar is then packaged in a slow-digesting form. 

Yes, juices and smoothies > regular coke - but honestly, I'd be hesitant to say that they are > sugar-free coke in many cases. If you're a healthy weight then juices or smoothies are fine, but if you're overweight I'd probably prioritise reducing calories and switching to a zero-sugar drink."

I had a friend put it to me this way, which changed how I view it. The voice is basically just another instrument. When the electric guitar became popular, many traditional acoustic guitarists called it garbage and something that lacked skill. All auto-tune has done is to enable other types of music genres and flavours to be made. Most electronic music producers can't play guitar, or drums, or bass. That doesn't make the music they produce any less good."

PublicFreakout,feirel9,t1_fein4n7,1579145306.0,"It's okay because the officers fulfil different roles that are more suited to their sex? How is this difficult for so many people to understand? A man can deal with physical alterations that most women can't, but most guys also shit the bed when it comes to dealing with anything requiring emotional intelligence. I remember calling the police when my friend was raped a few years ago, and the male officer and I looked like lost puppies trying to deal with this girl in hysterics. It wasn't until the female officer came in and took control of the situation and comforted her that any information could be coaxed out. This also extends to dealing emotionally with men. 

There are plenty of studies showing that men are more willing to confide in women from a state of vulnerability, but become completely defensive around men. Women are better at diffusing an altercation, whereas male officers can often escalate the situation. Almost all of a police officers job is none-violent. Seeing some of these comments saying that women shouldn't be police officers is baffling to me.

There's always going to be the job that a woman will struggle to do. Likewise, there's the part of the job that a man will struggle to do. The whole point of mixed-sex partners is that they compliment each-others weaknesses."
Silmarillionmemes,feict6n,t1_fehpsqj,1579135501.0,"I think part of the reason it is strange to most people to have a diverse cast in a setting like this is that it's based in a world where long-distance migration is incredibly limited. The show producers are transplanting a modern, multi-cultural society, where migration is frequent, far, and common due to flight, and putting that in fantasy settings where it takes months to travel between places by foot or horseback. One may argue that people get displaced because of war or other factors, but using Game of Thrones as an example, a war in the North would cause almost everyone to migrate to the Riverlands; not evenly distribute themselves based on skin colour from there to the bloody Summer Isles. When Old Valyria fell, in the aftermath of the Doom the eight colony-states threw off their Valyrian overlords and became the Free Cities, eventually joining one another in trade and commerce links, along with the Secret City of Braavos to the far north. Everyone stayed in and around Essos. The only people who ended up in Westeros were the Targaryens - which only made sense because they had fucking dragons. People aren't moaning because some of the characters have different skin pigments - they're moaning because for some reason there's always a black, brown and white person, regardless of whether it's in the middle of the desert, or in the snowy mountain depths. Forced diversity is not compatible with effective world-building.

I abhor racism in all its forms, but I think the qualms 90%+ of people have regarding this forced diversity don't stem from a place of racism at all. The Game of Thrones TV show may have had its issues, but from what I remember it demonstrated race very well. Trading ports had a variety of different races *because it made sense to*. The slaver bays had a variety of races *because it made sense to*. Everywhere else was less diverse *because it made sense to*. Dothraki looked the way they did because of generations spent adapting to the wind-battered steppes. The Northmen looked the way they did because of generations spent adapting to the cold winter months. The Dornish looked the way they did due to generations spent adapting to the harsh desert sun. The Summer Islanders looked the way they did because of the tropical climate found there, and it's relative isolation from the rest of the world. We know the reasons as to why people look the way they do, so throwing up your hands and saying ""well, there's magic and that's not real, so genetics and race are different here too"" is not effective social protesting - it's shitty writing and world-building. 

I'm all for people of different minority, racial and ethnic groups being represented more abundantly in media, but rally for racially diverse casts in stories *that are racially diverse*. Look to different settings in fantasy that are rarely portrayed, not to make commonly portrayed settings different."

This change would only serve to add a bit of historical accuracy, and if anything, make certain tiles even more valuable - and of more strategic interest.

We're all prone to it. I'd say most of us here play video games out of habit rather than enjoyment. Walk down a path enough times and it smooths down to a slide. To take a different path towards a healthy lifestyle requires deviation from that slide, and the steeper the slide is, the harder it is to get off. 

A large part of most therapy is simply recognising these negative thought patterns, the slides we slip down, and devising mechanisms to break out of them. That's why getting therapy, a supportive group of friends, a personal trainer, an AA group, a parental figure you respect - whatever it is, just someone to hold you accountable - is so important in breaking an addiction and developing new habits. I imagine that's why Greek has been so successful; he's spending more time with his parents and is surrounded by a group of people cheering him on.

Back to the original comment. Keep doing what you're doing, trying to get her moving and looking after herself. Getting someone to break a negative thought loop will feel like a losing battle. Just keep in mind that every time she does something in a positive direction, it's like she's hacking away at a thicket to make a new path through the jungle that is her thoughts. Whether or not it's a conscious choice by her, eventually that path to a healthy-lifestyle gets more trodden than the unhealthy one; it becomes the slide, at which point you won't need to coax her into gear."

If the prior comment was true, that would mean we wouldn't consider sociopathy and psychopathy to be mental illness, among with many others. Those people are normally aware they are being manipulative, or lack empathy in some way. What makes it illness is that the 'normal/average/ordinary' person's brain doesn't work that way. Only a few mental illnesses actually impact self-awareness of the mental issue - i.e, they're delusion. Most just impact your ability or interest to do anything about it.

The DSM-5, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition is a tome on mental illness published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). It has almost unanimous acceptance as the authority on mental health disorders. DSM-5's official mental illness definition includes these key principles:

*     the distress is clinically significant (it meets all diagnostic criteria for the specific disorder);
*     there's a problem in the areas of thoughts, emotional regulation, and/or behaviour that reflects dysfunction (impaired or abnormal functioning);
*     the person experiences significant distress or disability in social, occupational, educational, or other important activities;
*     response to an extreme stressor, such as a loss, that is expected and culturally approved is not a mental disorder because rather than a dysfunction, it's an appropriate and temporary reaction to a stressor.

Omni jokes are the same, except you're not in a prison and the baby killers make up 98-99% of the population. When all you can think about while watching someone eat an egg, and joking about how deficient you are in something, is that every brother and nephew of the hen that laid the egg was dumped in a macerator alive or suffocated in a gas-chamber ([about 7 billion in 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119310636?via%3Dihub)), the jokes get a little old. 

I'm love a bit of dark humour, but when it's self-deprecating, or about something that happened in the past and we moved on from - not a present phenomenon. Joking about genocide was something done by the Nazis in WW2, or the Ottomans after WW1, or the Japanese in Nanking, or the US during colonization. Reading the accounts and justifications of people that carried out these atrocities, I sometimes see word-for-word parallels to the jokes I hear daily by omnivores trying to justify their meat consumption. The only differences between those massacres and the ones done by animal agriculture in my eyes are that we eat the dead, and it's on a scale 100's if not 1000's of times larger than anything we've seen before in history."

If you're always the one that needs to reach out then, bluntly put, you just haven't met enough people. I'm going to be frank - your sample size is more than likely too small to tell if it's you or them, and made up of a similar sort of person who communicates in equally unresponsive ways, so you need to increase that circle to stop from feeling the way you do. Ask yourself; are you always messaging 1 person first? 2 people? 5? 10? 100? 500? 1000? Do those people make up the same circle of friends or school, or workplace, or hobby group? There are so many variables that go into social interactions; you can never make the assumption that you're the problem until you have thousands of connections to honestly make that call, at which point I guarantee you'll have found a person who does nothing but text you first.

I felt as you did when I was in my early teens. I had it in my head that I was making all the effort and there was no reciprocation. Then I went to college and met more people who were all slightly different from my previous school, and some were easier to befriend and some harder - some friendships simple to maintain and some impossible. I went to university and the same happened again. I joined societies and all of them had different types of people who required differing efforts to keep up contact. Surf society? A bunch of socialite beach bums who did nothing but message constantly to meet up and go out. Math soc? A load of socially anxious people that disguised vast wells of experience and interests when you coaxed them into opening up, but would never message first at risk of coming across over-bearing. I started my job and the cycle continues - I work with a bunch of engineers, so socialising with them is like trying to put a cat in the bath, but even though I always need to initiate conversation they appreciate it all the same. 

Hell, I probably couldn't tell you the last time my best mate messaged first, but that's just who he is. Hell, it takes him nearly a week to get back to me sometimes. That aside, I'm his best man for his wedding so clearly ""who messages first"" isn't a particularly good indicator of friendship anyway. I've got other friends that would probably say the same about me as I do him. 

Don't over analyse it. Join a sports team. Go to a dance class. Sign up to group art sessions. Do some CrossFit classes. Join a World of Warcraft guild. Change your job. Make enough connections with people and you'll start to realise that some people simply don't reciprocate, but if you like them and feel it's worth the effort to maintain contact then do it.

They discuss why social behaviour appears to be so rare in reptiles. About 20% of reptile species studied are social creatures, and most all are until they reach adulthood. In the grand scheme of things, sea turtles are not a highly social species as we can see in other animals (or on Finding Nemo), but at certain stages of their life cycle, some congregate in shallow waters.

The first contact they have with each other is at birth. The hatchlings are grouped, instinctively looking for the sea. Once the objective is achieved, they separate and do not socialize again with other turtles until mating. In some cases there are high concentrations of algae or marine plants that attract a large number and feed at the same time massively; Once they have finished eating, they return to their solitary life. A female turtle will always return to the beach they were born, which is why they often appear to be ""group"" animals to us."
