fatlogic,fgkpc9f,t1_fgkll25,1580870667.0,"I eat meat maybe twice a week if that, I started cutting back about the beginning of January. I've never been a huge meat eater, so cutting it out hasn't been a big deal, but if I do have a craving for a burger or bacon I'll still eat it, just not as much or as often. Like instead of four pieces of bacon I'll have two or one or opt for a veggie burger or a single hamburger instead of a double. Obviously the ideal is to never eat meat again but I think it's been alot easier of an adjustment knowing it's not completely off limits, but to try curb the craving with something just as good or give in but not indulge as much as I use to."
fatlogic,fgkhzur,t1_fgk57te,1580866011.0,I'm a notorious bored snacker. I just eat less during the day so I can snack at night.
fatlogic,fgkgeez,t3_eyrcxb,1580864954.0,"I've been feeling my inner hippie taking over lately, so I've really been trying to be more environmentally conscious and health conscious. So as a result I've been cutting back on my meat consumption and replacing it with things like nuts, beans, and good carbs. And oh my god, I have never felt better in my life. I have more energy, my skin has cleared up sooo much, my mood is better, and I can fulfill my snack attacks because I'm not taking in as many calories. Also have lost a half inch off my waist, sooo happy dance!"

But looking at the background in this photo I'm pretty sure this is one of the worst owl cafes he visited. Loud music, short leg leashes, clipped wings, extremely bright lights, and most of the owls had one eye open, one closed due to extreme exhaustion."
