politics,ff30ikw,t1_ff2z5zq,1579530392.0,"> I simply don't understand this willingness to absolve Republican voters of responsibility. 

People do the good they know.  Republicans have been indoctrinated that the only good one can do is for oneself and one's tribe.  We can disagree with the paradigm, but changing it is out of scope short-term, especially considering the tribalism of evidence that ideology engenders - we are not kin, so we cannot be kind, and therefore our evidence of kindness must be a lie.

With people who agree that Good is defined as helping everyone, there can be disagreements on tactics.  The villain of The Boy Who Cried Wolf is not the wolf, after all."
politics,ff2zei2,t1_ff2621t,1579529460.0,"The problem Bernie has with minorities isn't his skin color, it's his ideas. Too often nominally socialist systems in the country (like HUD, GI Bill, welfare, etc) have been warped by the right into (or designed from baseline as) profoundly bigoted systems.  So while I trust Bernie to run a universal Health Care system, but I don't trust the next Republican President to - and they're not going to disappear.  For an example of what I mean, Victor Orban in Hungary used his power over the national health care system to close down hospitals in districts that didn't vote for him.  

This is why we need public-private systems.  Not because we want the rich to control things, but because we need changes for the worse to come with costs to those with the means to resist it, and not just push those costs back onto the poorest among us."

He'll try to pretend that the political outcome is a legal outcome, and that's where we have to throw the wrench in.  It's not a trial, it's a partisan vote.  Legally he's guilty as sin, but the Senate isn't a court of law, it is a court of public opinion.
