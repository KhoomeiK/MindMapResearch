facepalm,ff001cw,t1_fezuf4e,1579463695.0,I like how in his response to you he tries to stoke the flame even more by shedding light on specifically making shitty comments about trans people. Just another sad troll

politics,fem5y2m,t1_fem1qrc,1579240918.0,"It honestly depends on the host you're talking about, but for the most part the discourse on the show is for the most part on all spectrums of the democratic party."
politics,fem5rb1,t1_felytbx,1579240727.0,"I was about to say the same thing lol. Not to say that Obama didnt have alot of centrist policies, but the podcasts and podcasters themselves are relatively all over the place when it comes the tent that is the democratic party"
politics,fem5mmi,t1_feltg7o,1579240595.0,"Fuck yeah man! Those podcasts most definitely got me more interested in politics, and encouraged me to do my own research into news stories. Always nice to see some pod heads out there!"
politics,felgtpq,t1_feledxn,1579221839.0,"It's a weird position, and I say this as a permanent resident who can't vote. I've definitely seen the political climate change quite a bit in the past year. It gives me hope that people are listening, and trying to educate themselves. BUT, the problem is as you say, that alot of people feel disenfranchised, and that their vote means nothing, which in certain districts can be very true. It's not all a lost cause as we see in the blue wave in certain districts in 2018. It's a tough time, and I certainly hope it changes soon."
worldnews,feky142,t1_fekqypc,1579209957.0,"Damn man, as someone who's about to turn 30 that just blows my mind. Not to say I'm in any way more intelligent than the next person, but using the ""it's easier to ask for forgiveness rather than permission"" excuse seems like the last fucking thing I would do at this age, especially when it's someone else's property that I'm using."

comics,fdlbcqs,t1_fdla1k9,1578520400.0,"As someone who enjoyed it, I just really enjoyed the way  cinematography portrayed the time period it was set it in. Everything felt super empty and hopeless as I watched it, which I imagine was what it was like back in early 1600s New England. But I totally get why alot of people didn't enjoy it. It was definitely slow moving."

WTF,fdfasyx,t1_fdf5f9b,1578357323.0,"Much respect on that man, before I played 4 the second one was my favorite as well. I think we can both agree that Uncharted in general is a great series!"
