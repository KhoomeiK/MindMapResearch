As a result, the production line was cut at under 200 units produced and the R&D costs were spread out over that low number, so the per-unit cost was insane. 

On the other hand, since the F-35 is going to be the main fighter for the USAF, USN and USMC, PLUS it'll be sold to a ton of US allies in Europe as well as a good amount in Asia, its per-unit costs will soon fall to below the late-model F-16Vs that are still a generation behind it.

I got one online for a good price and ended up being not very happy with it compared to my standard decocker. 

For one, the trigger doesn't have a wall, it just sort of has creep and then somewhere it goes bang. I put a Cajun 3-piece spring kit in and that lightened the pull but didn't fix the whole thing about not feeling a wall before the break. 

For another, go googling the issue metal-framed Omega trigger guns have about the decocker/safety backing out and falling out of the gun. Basically the part that rotates on the inside is supposed to be not able to come out without the ejector being depressed, but somehow it can still happen. I ended up using a punch to dimple the end of the rotating part, that goes into the right side of the safety/decocker, to add some friction and make it less likely that it would back out into the frame. For some reason it doesn't seem to happen on P07/P09s, but on the metal-framed guns it does. The proof marks on mine indicate it was a 2019-produced firearm, so it's not like the issue is for sure fixed yet."

Having to remove possibly over 6 wheels just to access one inner wheel takes time, and that's time in which your tank is not at the front being useful in wartime. 

Notably, despite the fact that interlocking roadwheels is a cool engineering strategy to more evenly distribute the weight of the vehicle along the tracks, *nobody has used it in a production vehicle since* \* that I can find examples of in Cold War vehicles between the US, Western Europe, and USSR. 

One other downside that I've heard of (but haven't personally seen evidence of besides forum posts) is mud getting in between the dozens of wheels that are overlapping and then freezing in place, which would not be an issue without the overlapping wheels. On the one hand tank engines should be very torquey, on the other hand if there are dozens of such places where stuff has frozen together maybe it would actually be a real hindrance."

The Tiger was supposed to be a ""breakthrough"" tank, only one tool in the tank unit's arsenal that would be occasionally massed and used to punch through enemy lines, and then other units would follow. They weren't designed to be used day-in and day-out, but instead only on pushes - and as a result a tank that requires a few days of maintenance every week wouldn't have been a huge problem. 

The Panther, on the other hand, was just a rushed design that gave little thought to maintenance because it was simply designed to be available in time for the German offensives at Kursk. That ended up being a disaster, since the Germans had to delay the Kursk offensive while waiting for the Panthers to be delivered, and they rushed the development of the Panther to get it ""on time""-ish for Kursk. The transmissions would blow up after relatively short intervals, replacing them was a job and a half, the interlocking roadwheels meant that you'd have to take multiple separate wheels off just to access the one behind, the engines were unreliable and prone to catching fire...it's a great tank on paper but still has its problems.
