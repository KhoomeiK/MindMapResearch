However, now the institutions they support self-regulate themselves with traditionalist moral fallacies rationalizing their own existence. It's a more abstracted version of our history in slave-owners fighting for the right to own slaves."
science,ffthy5h,t1_fftfx5y,1580221023.0,"I prefer to equate it with psychopathy. It's not that these institutions hate poor people, some might, but they're largely benign. These institutions only exist to maximize profits for themselves with no discretion for anything else.

This aligns with psychopathy because a clinical psychopath doesn't choose evil actions from a healthy mind so much as their brain has been programmed in a way to have zero empathy. These institutions, just like psychopaths, don't care about the well being of others, they only care about profits. If it becomes profitable for them to hurt society, they will do everything they can to achieve that goal so long as they can put the cost of that suffering onto someone else. That's the goal of insurance companies in a nut-shell: monopolize the low risk and high return people with minimized coverage, dump all the high risk and low return people onto society to deal with the burden.

It should be said that governmental programs are not the problem here. They're the scapegoat. They're the underfunded programs that were often purposefully made to fail. That's where all sick and poor people we mentioned earlier go after all. Usually the design of these systems are made under the control of our prevailing privatized healthcare system. And obviously their goal is for the government to fail such that the mere idea of governmental support towards healthcare will look unpalatable to future voters."

If you go by the hard and fast definition of socialism - workers owning the means of production than no. America nor any country has ever been socialist. If you instead look at the philosophy behind socialism, the sense of democracy at the workplace, you will see America only values the rich in this regard, or in other words a plutocracy. So, from that frame, there is a philosophy of socialism in America, but it's only for rich people when they need bailing out or when taxes must supplement the costs they force onto society via things like pollution, lack of healthcare coverage, homelessness, etc."
science,ffsh9n9,t1_ffrz8i1,1580181670.0,"That only suggests what we already know, a traditional failure in politics towards the well being of citizens. Means testing is valuable only to corporations that profit off of dividing and conquering healthcare against citizens, they insure all the healthy and affluent people - while getting away with providing them terrible coverage, and dropping all the sick and poor people onto the government, or just leaving them with nothing.

 It is not even profitable for anyone that actually has to deal with the consequences of sick people. It's only another classic case of privatizing profits while socializing costs. They make $100 billion per year, we get 30,000 to 45,000 dead every year due to fearing the cost of going to the hospital, 500,000 bankrupted per year due to this cost, and a tradition of accepting this as fine despite it costing less to fix these problems."

gaming,ffqtw49,t1_ffqm3qt,1580143537.0,"It's actually funny how often this is misguided. People are horrible at being unpredictable but the funny part is prediction is often completely necessary for victory. The better philosophy for victory is often the complete opposite perspective, understanding all options available to all players and choosing the option that leads to the best outcome assuming your opponent is doing the same. Only if the game has ""type"" advantages of some sort, where yomi come into play, should players consider other variables. Still, good games never have it as simply as rock paper scissors so even that element can be exploited whether there's a liability of skill, worse risk to reward ratios, or other options that make one better than another.

A good example is fighting games. Predicting your opponent is always valuable in those games but it should almost never be crucial to winning for a high tier character. The key to winning against the majority of your opponents is simply understanding the details of the game better or execution of that knowledge with superior skill - a character that gives you leverage here with superior options is going to put any ""predictions"" in your favor. But in short, if you have to rely on predicting your opponent to win, you've already lowered your probability of winning."

There isn't a working class American alive that doesn't know a loved one with a story similar to yours. We all must fight for each other, it's the only way we can win. The history of suffering is simply too much for us not to try out best. 

I only wish we truly knew the actual numbers on what a mess all of this truly is. How many people die, miss work, and subsequently get sick due to people being afraid of either missing work or the costs of going to the hospital? Of course all of us here have seen the statistics showing 30,000 to 45,000 Americans die per year due to fearing hospital costs, but we all know this is a conservative estimate. Nobody knows the true suffering from all the consequences this torturous failure in policy has produced.

So many people delay and suffer alone with illness due to this failure, they don't go early when they should and it gets worse, or they pass on illness to others because they must go to work when they should be getting better, and then more people ultimately miss work or suffer due to this broken system. There's simply no logical reason for society to endorse market restrictions on keeping citizens healthy, it's not even profitable for the psychopaths that created this mess. If you bankrupt someone for simply seeing the doctor, of course they're not going to go, and of course it's going to get worse for everyone in society due to this cascading choice.

I've heard that argument before and I simply don't see it as a moral thing we can continue the 21st century. Risk has largely been eliminated for the people with the established power as it currently exists. Most of the \~0.3% companies you're referring to are insurmountable and have practically escaped the merit of competition capitalism promised to be measured on.

Differentiation is a good thing, especially if you believe all politicians are crooked or if you have misguided oversimplifications such as there is no meaningful difference between democrats and republicans."
pics,ff0175o,t1_fezrstq,1579464043.0,"Optics aside, I can't agree that a Biden presidency would be better than a Sanders presidency. There is zero reasonable justification for that conclusion. We can debate on optics or who is more electable given the imperfect information people have, but if people did have a high level of knowledge on this topic there is no set of values in Americans that would evaluate Biden as superior to Bernie. Every rational self-interested person with that conclusion is ignorant. Whether those values are based on policy or on history, there's no defense for that conclusion.

I understand in all likelihood you were pointing to the unlikelihood of Bernie's policies being passed through congress. That's true, his plans are difficult for the defenders of the status quo to accept. But frankly, I'd rather have decent plans for Americans fought for than simply have Americans lose by default for 4 more years. We have had a tradition of failure in politics. If you want to change that, it's hard. But that's just how it is.

You're right that the majority of young people have historically not voted. What you may not know is the majority of young people support Bernie. Not a majority in the sense that he has the greatest amount compared to any candidate, no, there are polls where he has greater than 50% of support among people 18-30. 

Their framework for politics is not going anywhere. The mainstream will either lose gracefully now or this will only escalate potentially disastrously later. They'll be back, just like they were last time, in greater numbers every 4 years, until they win. Make no mistake, the majority of these people will never support Biden or any establishment democrat. They will abandon all of their current strong support, all of their campaigning assistance, donations, and even enthusiasm for talking like this won't matter to them. 

Why? Because there will be no reason to discuss the differences between Biden and Trump.. there will be no reason to fight for Biden or Trump.. at that time we all simply lose and have to accept a very minuscule difference as our values are abandoned again for 4 more years. What happens when a society has a polarization of this magnitude and it's abandoned is anyone's guess, but I must say it reminds me of the scene in Joker where he says, ""What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner, with a society that abandons him, and treats him like trash? You get what you fucking deserve."" just before Joker shoots Murray. 

We will live to see the repercussions of that abandonment in politics if it remains as it does today. Personally, I don't believe the left will be violent, historically that's never been the case. But I do think society will crumble the longer this goes on and frankly, I think we're extremely fucked if we don't have a president fighting for climate change reform soon. Your average person has no idea how fucked we are there. All of Bernie's policies are great but this notion alone is everything in a decade or two from now."

I think it would be best to focus on the practicality of Biden since you seem to value that most.

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3S4ttnR1sM) may be of value to you in understanding why Biden would lose to Trump. I don't recall the video in detail, but I remember when watching it thinking it may appeal to people with a perspective like yours. Biden has a terrible history that can easily be used against him, he's advocated for cutting social security many times, multiple terrible votes on foreign policy, he's the quintessential establishment democrat linked to many of those obvious short comings that Trump has railroaded before, but the list goes on endlessly. Biden doesn't have any momentum going for him, despite his good polling. He doesn't even have a strong policy platform, a central idea as to why he wants to be president. His entire campaign is centered on him not being Trump and supposedly more electable because of name recognition. His parallels to Hillary Clinton as a candidate are sadly quite astounding.  


What does all of that mean if he's the democratic nominee? It means he's going to play defense, as he fails to justify all of the mistakes he's made in his terrible history. It means the candidates will only talk about Trump, he's the focal point, and he's the only one anyone will think about. People will not have a reason to vote for Biden, other than he's not Trump. Clinton ran on that message too basically with all the weaknesses Biden has. So, we're playing essentially the same game, Trump simply only has to do the same playbook he did in 2016, but this time he has experience and tremendous momentum.  


I understand polling and Biden has a minor advantage in that realm but I have no reason to believe that advantage will be maintained when he's against Trump. There's no legitimate reason why Biden leads in polls now, but there's also no lofty media focused attacks against Biden either - and for good reason given he's largely a status quo candidate as the most powerful would find both Biden and Trump as good candidates. When it comes to enthusiasm, Biden will be slaughtered. Despite his polling, the man can barely fill rooms let alone get people to donate to him. There's zero reason people should want to vote for him and it shows. I just don't think not being Trump is going to have enough swaying power for Biden to win, which is pretty sad given that's a pretty low bar. I know Biden is a better candidate than Trump but his policy differences are so minuscule, there is little motivation to vote for him and I probably wouldn't bother despite knowing he's better than Trump. Enthusiasm, hope, wise plans - those all matter a lot and Biden has none of it. A Biden election in this country would only cement my confidence global warming is going to become a tremendous problem and we will regret passing up on our best chances this decade when we had them."

I called him an egomaniac because he had no business joining the presidential race so late.

Of course neither will win, but the idea that you can poor a hundred million dollars at the last months of a presidential primary and poll even a few percent is pretty disgusting.

He's only here because of fear, he knows Biden was the establishment candidate but confidence for him has been wavering - he likely made this move out of thoughts his worldview.

Still, from my perspective, I can rationalize violence like this by Iranians. That's not an endorsement, I see it as a meager consequence to the failures in American foreign policy. If there ever was a fair consequence for the things we've done to them, we would have nuked Iran a long time ago."
worldnews,fesv8wu,t1_fesq976,1579369350.0,"Nobody is defending Soleimani here. I'm only challenging the oversimplified narrative here. I'm trying to explain the failed American foreign policy that has put Iran in the state it is in today. It's easy to rationalize why men like Soleimani exist and from my perspective it's because the history in Iran, with respect to America, has largely been American's being aggressors and Iranians simply defending themselves. America toppled the democratically elected leader in Iran only a few generations ago, until they were able to regain control over their country in 1979 only due to the surveillance state not being as prominent in mosques.  


Also, please provide your evidence for the NATO attack claim. I searched google for it briefly but didn't find anything immediately. It's easy to paint Soleimani as a terrible person or a terrorist - because he was. That still doesn't mean much towards understanding the relations between the two countries or who may be more justified in committing violence. There are many acts of violence Iran and Soleimani have done that are disgusting. It should be known however that American foreign policy in Iran has been committed orders of magnitude worse and the conditions for Iranians currently can largely be held culpable to American influence generations ago."

Declarations like this are not significant. There are many high ranking American officials that should then be justified for assassination by this very same perspective. The claims that Soleimani was a terrorist is an extremely reductionist take on things, often coming from people that have no knowledge of the history in Iran. Do you know how long Iran has been independent from a USA propped dictatorship of their country? Only 40 years. Personally, many acts of ""terrorism"" they commit against Americans, and I am an American, I can rationalize as somewhat justified given that knowledge.

Meanwhile, we have countless videos of Trump blatantly saying he's in Syria explicitly for the oil.

There are many stories to tell regarding politics and getting even a decent perspective requires a very open mind and a respectable commitment to learning. Claims that the USA acted against domestic and international law on this issue are incredibly easy to justify given our current knowledge. Will this actually be verified in court?

Post hoc justification like that should be harshly condemned, especially because in that context there is no reason to not ask congress for approval of such measures.

Trump isn't the cause of this, but he certainly is the most glaring example of terrible American foreign policy justifications, especially following 9/11.   


Pragmatically, I don't believe any sanctions or military escalation against America will benefit anyone, however. I would much rather see world leaders congregate in peaceful agreements for their own benefit or publicly shame America as they did here. Military escalation on grounds of human rights violations and international war crimes America has committed is unlikely to result in positive effects, whereas peaceful repercussions hurting America would be more illuminating in that regard.

gaybros,fenfdpe,t1_fend790,1579283501.0,"That's great, I'm really glad to hear that. I would recommend a steady progression too for anyone wishing to learn exercises.

I would still recommend pull ups as a focal point with that goal but it's good to train the entire body otherwise we can promote muscle imbalances. You can still focus on those muscle groups you want to emphasis by doing them more often though.

I'd recommend learning the exercises that are called compound exercises - exercises that have multiple joints / muscle groups utilized all at once. Those exercises will give you the most support in both strength/stability when you do them with good form.

Here is what I'd consider the best compound exercises:
Deadlift, Squats, Pull up, Bench press, Overhead press

I would highly recommend taking the time to progress in those exercises with good form, especially pull ups.

With only those exercises you can train practically the entire body with minimal variations necessary. Given the goal you said of strengthening your arms, abdomen, and back, I'd try to do a program focusing more on pull ups, bench press, and overhead press. You will surprisingly get a lot of abdomen work from progressing in pull ups and overhead press. Front squats can also be pretty very good for strengthening the abdomen but you can do more isolation exercises there too if you want."
gaybros,fencw8z,t1_femoix7,1579281988.0,"I have scoliosis too. I'd recommend seeing a specialist to ensure you can do spinal loading exercises (exercises like squat and deadlift where the force of the weight travels through the whole body) before you begin them. Nobody at the gym can be confident if it's safe for you to do those exercises, only a doctor. That being said, the gym can be incredibly valuable for you and I would highly recommend prioritizing the gym.

In a general case, I believe if the lumbar part of the spine is in healthy or in stable alignment, it's likely you're safe to do any exercises but I'm not a doctor.

Since you're 16, you're likely still growing. In my experience, I'd highly recommend you strengthen the muscles in your upper body as the top priority. Exercises like pull ups or even weighted pull ups is probably the best exercise you can do for yourself. In my experience, this exercise will improve your posture the most and it will make it more difficult for your curve to progress if it's in the thoracic region.

All cases can be different for scoliosis. Mine allows me to do any exercise in the gym safely and with any amount of weight.  I've trained with mine stably at about a 45 degree curve for over many years too.

If you need any further help or knowledge on training with scoliosis, I'm happy to assist you with what I know."
