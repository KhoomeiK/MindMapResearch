study,ffxgy4y,t3_evq9jc,1580324932.0,"Try to take at least one longer break in the middle of your day. Get enough fresh air and eat healthy. Personally I think studying 8+ hours in a day isn't healthy so try to be reasonable and kind to yourself in the amount of time. When I study for 8+ hours, I lose focus the next day. DO NOT forget to have some fun activity every day. You deserve to relax. Try to have something to look forward to at the end of the day 
These are mostly from my own experience. Hope it helps"
