Total cringe and “nice guy” vibe.  That’s like those guys who tell lesbian women, “you just haven’t tried the right dick”

Dude sounds like a creep. I’m glad you didn’t accept his bullshit."
AskMen,ffihw60,t1_ffgcqgt,1579974258.0,"I like seeing social justice messages in my shows but the newest doctor and her companions...Jesus fucking Christ are they heavy handed with that shit. 

Hello, I’m the first female doctor. Meet my new companions, a black teen male with a disability, a Muslim female cop, and an old white man to be their foil but also allow us to talk about old people. 


The Rosa parks episode was so cringe. The bad guy was literally just a time traveling space racist.  The whole season had me groaning with how heavy handed they were and o usually love stuff like that."

AskMen,ffig1wr,t3_etcmuk,1579973009.0,"Supernatural. At a certain point you just get tired of the formula of: one brother does a stupid thing the other brother has to be self sacrificial. 

They should have stopped after the angels/apocalypse story arc"
bipolar,ffif9er,t1_ffg67l5,1579972466.0,Sounds like a “nice guy” who was trying to segue into “I can give you that kind of love.”
DMAcademy,ffhm7jz,t1_ffgt42k,1579941954.0,"Even better. Make it a mundane fetch quest that’s just made difficult and ridiculous because everything is huge.

atheism,fffz489,t3_et9x6h,1579894957.0,"Freud said something along the lines of religion being an extra step to the same conclusion. Life sucks and a you have to accept it. Inevitably if things don’t get better they say “oh well, it must have been God’s will,” and accept whatever tragedy they have experienced. They were inevitably going to have to accept things anyway"

TrueOffMyChest,fffk59q,t1_ffee1d3,1579885706.0,Whenever I see “sapiosexual” on a dating profile it’s an immediate swipe left.

DescentintoAvernus,ffedk80,t1_ffe7rxz,1579844083.0,"I don’t see why you couldn’t let one player finish the campaign as an OP half angel. It pisses me off when they say, “this makes the character a DM NPC”"
