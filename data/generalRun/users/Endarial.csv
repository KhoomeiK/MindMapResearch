Also, all armour will need to be hand built. This feature will require extra mo-cap time, as they will need to make sure that the sewing, stitching and cutting of material looks correct."

In the movie, he is in the library, breaking a stone floor tile. Each time he hits the tile, it makes a loud bang. However, the camera keeps showing the librarian stamping a book just as the bang happens. 

Well, this happened to me during a class I was teaching. I was stamping kids books. There was a lightning storm going on outside. Just for fun, I held the stamp up high and then brought it down hard on the book. Just as the stamp hit, thunder rumbled outside. The kids, who were all 5 or 6 years old, were surprised. I didn't it again and again, just as I hit the book, thunder rumbled. They started chanting ""Again! Again!""

I tried once more, but nothing happened. I looked at the stamp, shook it a few times and then tried again. Again, the stamp hit the book and again thunder rumbled. 

However, that was the end. I didn't have any more luck after that. But for a few, brief moments, I felt like I had power."

Anyway, this happened back in 2004. I was waiting to board a plane in Japan and the only other white folks in the line were an older couple. We started chatting an we realized we were from the same province. He mentioned that he lived in a certain town, which surprised me, because my cousin, who was in Taiwan with me, had made a good friend, in Taiwan, who was from the town this old guy was from. 

When I mentioned her name he said that he had been her P.E. teacher. I then mentioned that a long time ago my grandpa had taught there. Well, turns out this guy had been my grandpa's student. 

Then I mention where I am from and he says ""Do you know *name*?"" I said that he and I had been friends and graduated together. Well, the guy was my friends uncle.
