It looks like that is actually his diaphragm coming out as he breathes, which means his is not getting anything into that lung, and maybe not the other one. Either way he isn't breathing well. Sealing that wound with some saran would allow the diaphragm to do it's job. He needs to go to surgery ASAFP, that's for sure!"

facepalm,ff91ge5,t3_es8v16,1579702459.0,"While I don't agree with this sentiment, there are quite a few allegations of sexual misconduct, trafficking and abuse on the part of UN Peacekeepers. The UN published as much on their own site that they are investigating these allegations in the Central African Republic. I guess it goes to show that these peacekeepers aren't always that . In 2017, it was revealed by the Associated Press  that more than 100 [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) (UN) peacekeepers ran a child sex ring in Haiti over a 10-year period . Also,  As early as 2004, [Amnesty International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International) reported that under-age girls were being kidnapped, tortured and forced into prostitution in Kosovo with UN and NATO personnel being the customers driving the demand for the sex slaves. The UN's department of peacekeeping in New York acknowledged at that time that ""peacekeepers have come to be seen as part of the problem in trafficking rather than the solution"". 

That blue helmet isn't as altruistic as many would like to believe.

Space1999,ff711gn,t3_ecapv8,1579638988.0,"I absolutely have to agree with you with the evolution of way space and space travel became imagined. Using your reference to 2001, that was very clean and sleek, yet industrial on the Discovery, then we got 2010, an extension of that story, and we have the Leonov. Showing the Soviet penchant for utilitarian, it became tight and darker. What I do find interesting here is that the Eagle is one skip that transcends it all. It can work in either the clean and sterile element or the gritty and dirty element. It was my favorite of all the smaller chips.

Fin Fact - the Leonov was a driving element for another starship, the Omega Class Destroyers of Babylon 5."
