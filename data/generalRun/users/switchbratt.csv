Nanny,fenxj9u,t1_fenas2a,1579292281.0,"If the average is 11-12 then for 3 kids (standard is +$2 per kid) for just nanny care you should be at $15-16, but since you cook and clean also I would say at least $18-20. It depends on how long you've been there and what's in your contract as well, as far as when a raise should be implemented, however adding a bunch of new work with a new house might be a fine time to ask."

She asked me into her office when I was wearing a skirt, we had the ""fingertip rule"" (skirts had to be lower than your middle finger with hands down at your sides), and mine was the longer than required, but she was still convinced it was too short and wanted me to stand with my back to her and bend over and touch my toes to make sure she couldn't see anything (I refused) she would also make comments about how I might be hiding things in my bra and that she might have to check. I was flat as hell and wore very tight shirts, no idea what she thought I would be hiding. This was middle school. I was harrassed weekly for 3 years. Fuck school administrators."
