Diabetes isn't just about a failure to stay in shape or take care of yourself. It's about the function of your pancreas decreasing. It happens to skinny, fit people and to big fat people. There are also skinny fit people and big fat people who never get diabetes. The narrative in mainstream society is that people get diabetes because they don't live a healthy lifestyle, so diabetes is all your fault. That's not the whole picture. An unhealthy lifestyle increases your risk of diabetes, but you can do everything right and still get it. 

Ask for a referral to diabetes education. Primary care doctors don't always do this referral, they seem to like to handle diabetes in their office. Diabetes education helps you understand the disease and unlearn all the misinformation that's out there in society. It also helps you understand what you need to do to manage the disease. A lot of things people think are ""healthy"" are actually not very healthy, especially when it comes to diabetes."

The best things you can do for him are to be really consistent with his routine: feeding times, cleaning litter, grooming, etc. Make sure he has toys and stuff to entertain himself. Be friendly and and affectionate, but never force your affection on him or take him by surprise. When you are petting him, try to gently touch his paws a little at a time.

Regarding the living room, first get your partner in agreement with you. Second, you guys are the adults. She is the child. You make the rules. People sleep in bedrooms, not living rooms. Start by making and enforcing a rule that she sleeps in her bedroom. I don't care if she's an extrovert. If she can't sleep alone in a room that's not extroversion, that's an anxiety disorder and she needs to see a therapist.

My step kids (F14 & M13) live like hooligans with their mom. The get told to go to bed but there is no enforcement of actually turning off their phones and going to sleep. They wear their clothes all day, sleep in them, then wear them all the next day. They don't shower or brush their teeth unless someone tells them to, they refuse to take responsibility for remembering to do these things on their own.

Not when they are with us. I don't care if you wear your clothes twice, but at night you wear pajamas. They do NOT like to it, but their dad and I are on the same page and don't let them get away with pretending to forget. They also have to put on clean socks and underwear every day, and remember on their own to shower and brush teeth.

Things with diabetes change slowly. The first day of a new medication, the first week of a new diet or a new workout strategy, you don't always see a difference.

Extreme emotions like grief or anxiety will also cause an upswing. And your body will react to some foods differently than others.
