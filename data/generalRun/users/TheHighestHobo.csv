DarkSouls2,ff3wnnn,t3_erfs5f,1579550471.0,"if youre not prepped for soul farming, its probably faster to just get the 4 great souls again. The Rotten, The Old Iron King, and the Giant Lord are my favorite bosses to farm for shrine skips."
DarkSouls2,ff3wcj4,t1_ff1awm7,1579550279.0,"I purposely make my name coherent in Dark Souls to make people second guess if I am NPC or not, of course my combat style gives it away, but i like to think that a few people thought i was NPC before i parried them while 2handing a greataxe"
DarkSouls2,ff3vi8l,t1_ff2mef8,1579549756.0,"Just wanna put my comment here that I also play this game shieldless. I also play armorless tho, but thats just my thing. 25 ADP with <30% equip load = so many quick IFrames. I did a no death no bonfire run in vanilla DS2 with nothing but the Gyrm Greataxe and a lightning short bow."
DarkSouls2,ff3utkp,t3_erayqc,1579549329.0,"bro just soul vessel and put all your points into equip load, str, and adaptability and then get the Gyrm Greataxe from Gavlan and make it lightning +10 and then you 1 shot every enemy but Havel down there. Its easy."
DarkSouls2,ff36s4x,t1_ff2x42p,1579535039.0,"I used to be a mirror squire all the time for fun, and let me tell you, people do not expect the summoned person to be a real human. It's kinda cheesy to help a boss that is pretty deadly by himself, but it is so much fun to watch the other player panic"
todayilearned,feyikmb,t1_fewsg7v,1579445930.0,"no, the whole point of the argument was ""can an average US citizen reasonably save for an Everest hike."" You can move the goalposts all you want, but the average single person in the USA makes less than $50k/yr. This is just cold hard fact, and any anecdotal evidence you provide to the contrary is just that, anecdotal. I have anecdotal evidence too. My brother's first GF that was a dancer at a club. She was paid server wages, but took home $300 a night working 4 nights a week. Do you know how much $300 a night, 4 nights a week is? It's 62.4k. Her whole paycheck would often go to taxes. Was she living comfortably? Yes. Could she afford to cut her living expenses to pay for an excursion up the worlds tallest mountain? No."
todayilearned,fewfh0q,t1_few58kb,1579409718.0,"My brother is head of security at a strip club and I know plenty of servers and bartenders as I work in food myself. Not a single person I know in any of those jobs is making over 75k a year whether they report it or not. Anyone you know that is managing to make that much is working an insane amount, or is insanely lucky, and therefore, not average, which was the whole point of the argument."
todayilearned,few241f,t1_few1kk6,1579404415.0,"people who bring extra money in under the table are DEFINITELY the minority here. You do know that $15/hr is only $31,200/yr before taxes. I know PLENTY of adults that make between 15 and 25 dollars an hour and report all of their wages. I also wanna know what bartenders you know that are making $24/hr before their tips, I'd like to apply at their place of business."
todayilearned,few129l,t1_fevz6a5,1579403964.0,Median household income in the USA is around $60K and Average single adult age 25-40 income is $36K. The average US citizen cannot save $30K easily.

HistoryMemes,fdl77ys,t1_fdl6qf9,1578518219.0,"the brutes were angry with the elites because they believed themselves to be the superior fighting force AND they also believed they deserved the right to fight the humans themselves without the rest of the covenant because it was a Brute ship that discovered humans, but they had not actually done anything to take the power other than whisper into whatever powerful ears they could. The story of the Arbiter was the straw that broke that particular camels back and the covenant separated into 2 factions, with the new faction called ""the heretics"" because they went against the wishes of the prophets."
HistoryMemes,fdl4af3,t1_fdl3cmv,1578516802.0,"yo real talk, this is kinda how shit goes down in the covenant. The Elites are the best fighting force in the covenant, but one of the prophets convinces everyone that since one of the elites was a traitor that all of them are and it sparked a civil war within the covenant of elites v brutes while they were both already at war with the humans weakening the covenant armies severely."
todayilearned,fdl358m,t1_fdl1k0y,1578516254.0,"looking back on it I can agree with that, but in the moment it just seemed shitty. Someone else posted the video Lars made and watching it again gives me the same feeling. He just comes off as so lame."
todayilearned,fdl2zsi,t1_fdl1kop,1578516179.0,"no dude, its pretty bad. 100% their worst album that isn't a collaboration. No solos, uninteresting hooks, straight up annoying songs with ""frantic"", lars does the same thing literally all album, the snare sounds awful, the lyrics are easily their worst with ""st anger"" especially being a let down. I can understand enjoying it and some of the songs, but it is not a good album."
todayilearned,fdl1oe8,t1_fdkxddb,1578515505.0,"I appreciate how solid the cover is and how they put their own flavor, but man I can not enjoy how little energy the vocalist has in the beginning. His voice has no weight. It kinda gives off autotune vibes too."

todayilearned,fdl0gct,t1_fdkxvpj,1578514864.0,"anyone who pays attention dislikes the fact that metallica tried to get ""TEN MILLION DOLLARS MINIMUM"" from napster. I get that they should have control over their music, and that people should buy music they enjoy, but it just seemed shitty to see super successful musicians demand so much money."
pathofexile,fdjpq5q,t1_fdjpiyi,1578482567.0,"For me it was definitely a map that said primordial, no one in global chat believed me either. I was surprised to see uncorrupted vaal temple tho"

pathofexile,fcylbzy,t3_ejkjon,1578082118.0,"You aren't bricked because of that, I've had 4 or 5 elderslayers be lower level cause the watchstone expired and you can't socket a new one until you kill him, but that's all. The areas that lead to the citadel will be monster level 81 instead of 83 and subsequently, all of the elderslayers drops will be lower ilvl too, but they should still spawn."
pathofexile,fckv5yv,t3_ehmnz1,1577733878.0,Omfg I hope this helps me when I get home. Does it snapshot your citadel level when you fight sirus? I was running maps in glenaach all day yesterday and ran out of t14-16 because only t10-12 were dropping and no conquerors were spawning no matter what I did. I have a clip of a t12 dropping that's a copy of the t14 I was in!
pathofexile,fckbohm,t1_fck5zi3,1577721695.0,They were not from league mechanics. I'll find a spot cause I was actually streaming once when it happened. Regular monster on a map drops the map I was looking for except it was t12 instead of 14. I open my atlas and hover over it showing that it should be 14 and then hover the map and it says 12. I think there is a glitch involving quest states and having multiple characters.
pathofexile,fcjsrm9,t1_fcjoql9,1577702845.0,"This was happening to me all day yesterday. I'm at awaken 5 and can turn a whole side of the atlas into t14+. While running t16s almost all of my map drops were for t10-t12 and the kicker is that they are the same maps that should be dropping t14-t16. Also did over 60 maps yesterday and didn't fight a single conqueror. I tried changing hideout, swapping characters, running the lower tier maps it was dropping, literally nothing was spawning conquerors."
pathofexile,fbhtecc,t1_fbhrypk,1576881854.0,what about the fuckin watchstones that all only drop once for each area. There is definitely a way for it to work already with what theyve done before.
