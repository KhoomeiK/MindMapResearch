Firstly the simulation setup is really crap. Secondly, the lack of feedback screwed with me crazy levels. I just couldn't drive."
IAmA,fd06t95,t3_ejmp7u,1578114496.0,"This may be little orthogonal. 
I neither hate or love birds specifically. 
But in id apartment balcony a pigeon laid some eggs. NY wine was also pregnant that time. So we were sympathetic.  It tried gestating a few eggs and it kept failing. Eventually one of them hatched. Its has been a few weeks and the baby pigeon is now looking like an adult. But it refuses to get off the nest. It is trying to walk let alone fly. The mother pigeon ( I assume) visits every now and then but no progress. What should I do ?"

bangalore,fcq2yiy,t1_fcq19xz,1577877587.0,"But my bad crusts have been generally crumbly and unevenly cooked. Don't know if it's because of my microwave or dough. As in, it gets overcooked on outside and uncooked on the bottom"
bangalore,fcq16ax,t1_fcq11mb,1577876508.0,I get the dough ready in 2 hours. Put flour yeast sugar salt etc. Beat it. Wait for a few hours and then knead the dough and use. Maybe that's why
WatchPeopleDieInside,fcpe4pn,t3_eid1dc,1577860096.0,Can anyone give context of the video?
bangalore,fcpdo7t,t3_eie07k,1577859572.0,"How did the dough/base taste? Everytime I make at home , the toppings are very tasty. But base is hit or a miss. 

Also, you can easily bake your own bread, buns etc. That's also fun. Only tough (low ROI too) recipe is crossiant."
todayilearned,fcojuyi,t1_fcojn33,1577834052.0,"Oh. Maybe I worded it wrongly. 

What I meant was when you come with an external bias and read up more on internet it acts as an echo chamber and reinforces your biases. Without a bias, it is hard to make any sense out of a topic using internet is what I meant. 

Was just an observation."
todayilearned,fcoizc3,t1_fcoiohj,1577833397.0,"I got similar tones. It is very scary that nowadays internet is not a place where you can get unbiased information anymore. I just googled his name, it doesn't show up anything (mostly) negative."
todayilearned,fcoifo1,t1_fcoiddc,1577833000.0,I found the same on internet. But is Confederate army bad?

bangalore,fbx77ih,t3_eevhyy,1577172409.0,"1. You should not runaway. He will have incentive to catch you up because he knows you're scared 
2. Just take out the phone and capture the video. Then talk. He will get scared. 
I do this all the time. I have spoken to cops also. They say if you show the video, or give the number, they'll cancel the license"
