AMA,ffgetar,t1_ffge836,1579904639.0,Actually no. I didn’t google it. I learned about the cell thing in school and I learned the radiation stuff from watching the documentary on how they made the shelter to contain the radiation from the Chernobyl accident.
AMA,ffgdch9,t1_ffgbzc4,1579903720.0,It is neither false or true because it is impossible to test. But I would assume it would be false because of that. Oh I just remembered. Scientists  believe that part of what makes us age is when cells divide mistakes in the genes of the cells are made more and more. So when you are going a certain speed ultra small particles would bust though the cells disrupting the genes. (That’s basically how radiation exposure causes cancer). That is why it would correct.
AMA,ffg9la5,t1_ffg91ei,1579901413.0,"Well I would assume that frictional decay would occur if you are going fast enough essentially making you “age” faster, but to go a speed to cause a significant effect would mean you would probably be in an enclosed vehicle. To test this you could put a twin on earth and the other one in space and do a bunch of test. I am not sure of test you could actually use to test this. Carbon decay levels possibly. Essentially there would be so many outside factors that this is almost impossible to test."
