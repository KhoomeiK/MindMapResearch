depression,ffnxjiu,t3_eu7fur,1580072037.0,"i'm glad that you are still here, hope you stay long enough for something really good to finally happen. meanwhile, i'm just here barely hanging on, plan on writing my suicide journal once again, to let all these frustrations out before i eventually go and maybe, try to just breeze through as a ghost to make it easy — i... i don't know..."

depression,ffih655,t3_etqbpl,1579973772.0,"i know what it feels like, for someone who you trust your whole being with betrays you, stabs you in the back, insults you and to not be there when you needed them the  most. it's just heartbreaks upon heartbreaks and that which i knew, i don't need them in my life, they're not my friends and i don't deserve them. it's been years since then and i have yet to find someone, or some people i can wholly trust  again."

SuicideWatch,fco6u9w,t3_ei137q,1577825194.0,"people who say that are too stupid for this world. they're the same with the people who say that depressed people are weak shit and all the words that can bring a person down. it makes my fucking blood boil and to an extent, i wish for them to suffer from severe depression just for their words to bite them back and let them know what it feels like added it up with no people to watch their back ;-) yes i'm a terrible person, fuck them."
depression,fcm5tff,t3_ehtpnj,1577764988.0,"the thing about recovering is, you'll fall even harder when shit hits the fan once again and that feeling of severe dread, loneliness, anhedonia and sadness this time will now be too much to bear. but that's just me though, i feel like that if i recover and fall once again, that's it for me."
depression,fcm5j5f,t3_ehp6uj,1577764782.0,same and i have no hope for the next decade anyway. i'll see this decade through depressed as fuck and i definitely won't see through the next one.

depression,fcckqto,t3_egxcz7,1577599527.0,"it has, definitely has, for these past 6 years, it just gets worse. this year alone, no one greeted me on my birthday and this christmas alone, only one person personally messaged me."
