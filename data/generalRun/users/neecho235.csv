YouShouldKnow,fg2sqi1,t3_ewff7a,1580454334.0,"dit: please read the entire post before you comment. This is straight from a nurse practitioner. The advice is sound. You may wish to omit Gatorade for just water.

Flu facts-

1) The best prevention for the flu is the flu vaccine. You cannot get the flu from the vaccine.

2) You are contagious 1 day prior to symptoms and 5-7 days after symptoms begin. So stay the fuck home.

3) ANTIVIRALS LIKE TAMILFLU AND RELENZA DO NOT CURE THE FLU. At most, they shorten the illness by 12 hours and are useless if you have had symptoms > 48 hours. We have them in order to treat a special population of patients that are at high risk for developing complications, which they ARE very effective at doing.

4) If you do not have any of the following conditions or are living with someone who does, you do not need antiviral medications, so don't go to the ER or your doctor. Stay the fuck home.

5) Antiviral treatment is ONLY in dictated in the following groups; *Children < 5, adults > 65 

*Pregnant women 

*History of severe asthma, heart disease,diabetes or stroke 

 • HIV/AIDS, cancer or active immunosuppression 

 • Persons with neurologic conditions, usually wheelchair bound or severe developmental delay.

6) If you are not part of the above group....stay the fuck home. Leaving your house, going out in public, to the ER or Urgent Care or your Doctors, then to the pharmacy contaminates everyone and everything within a 100 foot radius that you go near.

7) Fevers are your friend. Your body runs them in order to kill the virus. Although the flu virus can live up to 167 degrees, running a temp of 101-102 weakens the virus significantly and allows your own natural immune cells to kill it faster. You must drink at least 1.5 - 2 liters of water mixed with gatorade in order to compensate to the fluid loss caused by the fever. So drink it. This is not recommended for children.

8) DO NOT take OTC cough suppressants and decongestants. Your body fights the flu by producing mucous to trap the virus and couching to eliminate this mucous from your lungs so that you don't get pneumonia. Drink lots of fluids instead.

9) Don't smoke or vape while you are sick. I shouldn't even need to mention this.

10) You will feel like crap and be uncomfortable. Deal with it. Going out and contaminating everyone else is not acceptable.

11) See your doctor if you are severely short of breath, coughing up blood have the worst headache of your life or a stiff neck or cannot stop vomiting.

12) GET VACCINATED!

YouShouldKnow,fg27wa8,t1_fg1tgg9,1580440151.0,Just water is the best alternative. Gatorade has some electrolytes in it which help. You should definitely not be drinking JUST Gatorade. You need at least 1.5-2 liters of water a day.

YouShouldKnow,fg27fud,t1_fg1vx1a,1580439931.0,I don't believe that the flu qualifies as an emergency for most people. If you are someone who identifies with #5 then it is more of an emergency for you.
