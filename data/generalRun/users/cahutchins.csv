Montana,fffcr8t,t3_etbyxt,1579881097.0,"So, I'm going to try and say this with some tongue-in-cheek humor, so I hope you won't take offense.

But this is like the most stereotypical ""moving to Montana"" post I've ever seen.

You're a pair of city slickers from California and Texas who want to move to a part of Montana that looks like the pictures you've seen of Glacier and Yellowstone, but you want somewhere that doesn't get cold. No immediate job prospects, though you're both working on your degrees. You visited Montana one time, and it didn't quite live up to your imagination. 

If I had a dollar for each post I've seen exactly like this one, I could buy the imaginary cabin in Tropical Glacier Park you're dreaming of.

It does get cold in the winter *everywhere* in Montana. Not everybody gets to live in the Bitterroot Valley in a Hallmark Channel cabin, especially not on a teacher's salary.

Now, there are certainly plenty of job opportunities all over the state for someone with K-12 teaching certification, and there are definitely jobs available with Fish Wildlife & Parks. I suggest you start looking at job opportunities, and do some proper research on the communities that have job openings. Look at the housing markets, look at the year-round weather, look at Google Maps and street view to get an idea of what these towns actually look like.

I'm not saying you can't make it work, and I'm not saying you couldn't find a great life here. Just... temper your expectations."

There's a very similar Italian recipe called [Uova in Purgatorio](https://allourway.com/spicy-eggs-in-purgatory-italian-dish/) (Eggs in Purgatory, which is an amazing name for a dish).

My official job title is Instructional Designer/LMS Support.

>What does a day or a week in your job look like?

Extremely variable, but on a given week during the semester I probably directly interact with at least a dozen individual faculty members. This includes scheduled consultations and support, but more often it's random calls, emails, and office visits for technical support, LMS support, and instructional and curriculum questions.

My office also conducts regularly scheduled weekly professional development sessions on a wide variety of technology and pedagogy topics. I also provide LMS support to students, this is usually a big part of my day at the start of each semester (especially fall) and much less later in the semester.

>What aspects of your job as an instructional designer or educational technologist you feel are exciting?

The wide diversity of projects. Just last week I:

* helped an instructor create some graphic design content for a course he was gamifying for the first time.
* helped a department design a new exit portfolio system for their graduating students.
* served on a search committee for hiring a new faculty position.
* helped an instructor investigate a case of potential plagiarism.
* helped the IT department track down some lost laptops that some instructors had checked out for use five years ago and never returned.
* helped three new adjuncts get their classrooms set up for their first day of class.
* And a couple dozen other random issues that I can't recall off the top of my head.

>What aspects are sometimes frustrating and challenging?

Curmudgeonly tenured faculty who don't want to update their curriculum, course design, or teaching practice.

Administrators who latch onto buzzwords and expensive hyped tech without really understanding or caring about their efficacy, or the possibility of alternatives.

>Are there any strategies you may share with me that make your role as an educational technologist more effective?

Building trusting relationships with stakeholders is the only way to get anything done. That happens through hard work, patience, and openness. Start by helping instructors improve their existing workflow. If you can show them results, they'll be more likely to listen to your suggestions in the future.

>What advice do you have for me to make the most of my time in my Master's program?

Don't get too hung up on specific technology, those can be so wildly different from one environment to the next that you can't prepare for everything. Focus on developing writing skills, interpersonal communication skills, public speaking skills, and foundational learning theories.

>What do you wish someone had told you about the field before you began?

This job (at least in higher ed) is at least 75% relational, it's what sets us apart from IT. Our job isn't to solve a problem and then crawl back into the walls of the building. Our job is to connect with faculty on a human level so that we can help them improve their teaching practice and ultimately create better outcomes for their students."

internetparents,fedy03n,t3_eolwg1,1579022273.0,"Emotion obviously plays a big part in decisions like this, [but there's actually research behind what you're feeling](https://www.inc.com/business-insider/study-reveals-commute-time-impacts-job-satisfaction.html).

>Researchers found that each extra minute of commuting time reduces both job and leisure time, and increases strain and worsens mental health for workers.  
>  
>Not all commuters fared the same, however. The study found commuters who walk or bike to work don't report the same dissatisfaction with their leisure time as those who commute by bus or train.  
>  
>Ultimately, an additional 20 minutes of commuting per day has the same negative effect on job satisfaction as receiving a 19% pay cut. That is to say, spending more time standing on a crowded train or sitting in mind-numbing traffic can make you feel just as bad as earning less money, even if you aren't.

You may love your coworkers and overall work environment, but the commute and overall low pay are both decreasing your happiness and wellbeing. It's a ""hidden cost"" that is weighing you down. A job with more money and less commute is going to give you a significant quality of life boost, as long as the work environment is bearable.

The other thing you should think about regarding your anxiety is [Imposter Syndrome](https://hbr.org/2008/05/overcoming-imposter-syndrome).

But the point of recognizing Imposter Syndrome is that those feelings are normal, and common, but usually not true. Your experience and skillset is valid, you deserve to be where you're at, you are competent at your profession, other people around you experience imposter feelings as well, including people that you look up to."

Let's say the flavor text on \[\[Ancient Grudge\]\] had been simply, ""*If there's one thing a warewolf hates, it's a collar.*"" That quip, paired with the card name and the art of a warewolf defacing a gravestone, would have been rather clever.

It tells us that the symbol on the gravestones (and in tons of other art in the set) is meant to signify a collar, it's not just an abstract symbol. It tells us that the idea of the collar represents the Church's effort to control and oppose the monsters of Innistrad. It tells us that warewolves have enough understanding of the situation to find the symbol infuriating. The name of the card tells us that this struggle between the human Church and Innistrad's monsters has been going on for centuries.

The full quote, on the other hand, is wildly redundant. It spells out details and ideas that would have been better left as clues and suggestions. It's structured in a way that humans don't usually speak or write, because we naturally take for granted the culture and history that we live in. By making that context explicit, it removes us from the setting.

internetparents,fdfw62j,t3_el62va,1578371838.0,"At your age and with essentially zero expenses, putting half of every paycheck into savings and not touching it until you're older is a great idea. One way to ensure you don't touch that savings is to [open up a Certificate of Deposit (CD) account with your bank](https://www.discover.com/online-banking/banking-topics/how-to-open-a-cd-account/) and put your savings in there. Generally there's a minimum amount you need in order to open a CD, usually at least a couple thousand dollars, though some banks will start as low as $500. 

When you put your money into a CD, the bank basically ""takes"" that money for a set term, usually between 1 and 2 years, and uses it for their own purposes, investments and giving out loans to other clients. In return for letting them use your money during that term, they'll give you a couple percentage points of return. 

For example: If you had $2000 and put it into a 2-year CD with a 2% rate of return, then after 2 years you'll get your money back plus an additional $80 of interest that it earned. The more money you put in and the longer you let the CD go, the more money it will earn.

The pro compared to just putting your money into a normal savings account is that a savings account will earn you essentially zero return. If you're worried about the temptation of spending your savings on frivolous crap, a CD will help keep you from doing that.

The con is that with a CD you can't get your money out of the account before the term is up unless you pay a substantial early withdraw fee, often a big chunk of the interest you would have earned."

Part of this is due to my university's size, we don't have the population or budget to have different line items for each of those jobs. 

Part of it is just faculty trust and familiarity, for example we have an IT department but they don't really know how to talk to humans, so faculty often end up coming to me for IT support because we have an existing rapport. Not really my job, but since my job depends on maintaining faculty trust and social capital, I do it.

Part of it is just the nature of my work in a CTL, I think Centers just naturally develop into nexus between faculty, students, and administration.

The older I get, the more I realize that *everything* is complexly interconnected. Nothing occurs in a vacuum, nothing is strictly black and white, nobody is purely good or purely bad, everything that happens is the result of a long timeline of causes and effects. 

One news media outlet that I like is NPR. Their daily evening news program, *All Things Considered*, does a particularly good job of covering current events, but also takes the time to explore context, history, marginalized perspectives and experiences, and the way things are connected. You likely have a Public Radio station in your community that you can pick up with any FM radio, or you can listen online. If you make a habit of catching two or three episodes a week, you'll feel like you have a much stronger grasp of what's happening in the world around you.

Another thing you should start thinking about is local and regional politics. Many people pay attention to national and world politics, but aren't aware of what's happening in their state and city. In the United States especially, state politics can have *huge* impacts on your daily life. Roads and infrastructure, public transit, education, local environmental issues, housing, business and the economy, cannabis legalization, gun laws, these things are often decided at the state and local level, not at the federal level. 

And critically, your vote will make a much bigger impact on your state and local elections than it will on the federal level. 

The presidential election will be won mostly in ""swing states"" like Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, etc. which have relatively high populations and are closely split between political parties, so they can swing one way or another. State elections and local city council or mayor elections often come down to extremely small margins, sometimes just a handful of votes."
