The bottom spaces are where I put in my daily tasks and to-dos without prioritizing. If something is due on that day, I generally note it, up top. But it’s usually 1-2 things maybe once a week. Do I give it more time to fill out as I get into the semester?

I don’t know what to do with the empty space on the right either. The top space I’ll use to doodle and such, that’s fine, but I’m not sure what to use the rest for? I have a tracker for the five things that I struggle to keep on top of, and then just empty space. I’ve looked up many ideas and am wondering what a student would find handy. 

Should I leave these blank for when I do find a use, because it is my first journal, and I’ve only just made this weekly spread after a month of planning the best layout. I love it, it works really well. Just don’t know what to do with empty space.

bulletjournal,ffhbrgv,t3_etldta,1579929127.0,"as a student I do weekly spreads every weekend and plan out my next week accordingly, then throughout the week I will use the next few pages to do any journaling with a small date in the corner, I don’t restrict myself with how many pages I should/could use. Sometimes I use pages to write stand-in notes If I’ve forgotten my notebook for a class. And then the following weekend when I need to make the new spread I start from the next page. It may sound a little haphazard, but I like that it doesn’t restrict me to allotting an X amount of space for journaling, as most of my journaling is very in the moment and I usually take up 1/2 pages, 4 max for days of notes and such.

I’ve been thinking of doing monthly planning as i seem to like my weekly layouts that I’ve come up with. So if I do this, I’ll follow the same method. A month planned out with weekly spreads done, then the next pages shall be used for ongoing journaling.

relationships,ffebu4m,t3_et15a1,1579842468.0,"I’m sorry, I’m not on the boat of just accept how things are. You are more than warranted to write out an apology and leave a letter in their mailbox, or just go in person and give it to them and explain that it is an apology and that you hope to repair the relationship as they are good neighbors. You should apologize to the girl as well, explain your thoughts. 

I don’t think you were wrong I’m feeling strange about your husband hanging out with a 19yr old. Especially that much time spent with her would throw me off too. It’s not normal, and I do think you should have asked him about it, but also explain that it is weird and that you feel weird and would feel better if you were included in some things or if she sometimes came over to your house with you around, so you could also befriend her if she truly was mature for her age.  I also think that your husband should have taken measures to ease these newfound insecurities. Idk but if my boyfriend was ever insecure about something I wouldn’t tell him to just trust what I say and get over it cause it’s my life and I can do as I please. That’s stupid, sure your husband seemed like he was being honest but he made no efforts to show you that your insecurities were ill founded and that you had a reason to trust his word. Trust in a relationship doesn’t mean blind trust, it means being able to trust your SO to help you ease insecurities that will undoubtedly arise. I find it annoying when people are like “there’s no trust in this relationship” no, it’s just that there’s no blind trust. It’s why you kept fighting every week, you felt like you were blindly trusting. You should have asked him to show you to trust you were friends and he should have understood.

You should have taken his suggestion for therapy yes. I think there may be stress associated with the fact that you both moved for your husbands job. Still think you should go. There might other issues that could be the root to these insecurities. It happens people get insecure, I’m sure your neighbors would understand. 

As far as the apology goes, if they don’t accept it, you can at least know that you attempted to make amends and apologized for your behavior. If they do accept it, it likely won’t be the same relationship but again it will make you less embarrassed and feel less guilty. 

Good luck, OP. 

P.s when and if you do apologize you don’t need to bring up the fact that M being gay is what eased insecurities, you just need to address that they are gone. That you were insecure and totally out of line to say things like those to M. Don’t bring up her being gay to others as you may not be sure if parents know and whatnot.

Edit: and you owe your husband an apology for doubting him. But you should also explain the feelings. Like I said you should still go to therapy with him."

ABCDesis,ff0e58t,t3_er0ust,1579468006.0,"I’ve found brown guys who were great but they all seemed to have issues with commitment, for one reason or another. Maybe it was my bad luck. Anyhow, it changed when I asked clearly what I wanted, which was commitment. And pretty soon found a Guyanese Indian guy who I’ve happily been dating for a little over a year now. 

I think setting boundaries is hard for Indian youth in general, as boundaries aren’t a thing defined in our culture. Once we learn to set boundaries we begin to find ourselves asking for someone willing to do the same, instead of just running from commitment (that’s not to say anyone with FWBs is afraid of commitment). 

Idk I don’t think it’s weird you have a FWB, if that’s what you want/need/desire at the moment. As long as you follow your own timing for seeking deeper connections, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with being in relationships you enjoy being in, no matter their level of commitment."
