**The physical.**

No-one can prove how well you see and hear. Pass a hearing test in a cabin? Pretend you can't hear anything from the right ear. Pass an eyesight test? Well, you can't see anything in 3D. Shit happens. Now you can't use a ton of aiming devices/displays or whatever they're called. Once that's done, pretend you can't see anything two lines after ZU. That is good enough to discharge you.

They will get VERY suspicious if you do that. Just stick to your guns. No, you can't see the fucking butterfly in the 3D test. No, you can't hear that. Period. They might rage. Stay on script.

Now if you want, you can also go the psych route. Many, many people try it. Most of them fail miserably at it.

**The psych eval**

First rule of Looney Club is: you don't talk about about much of a nut you are, and why. This is how you spot a really difficult psych patient. They don't talk. Now most people who want to fuck with shrinks, they sit, the shrink goes ""So, how are you doing?"" and they reply ""Yeah, you know, not so good"". And guess what? They go to the army. So you sit in front of the shrink, shrink asks you a question, you look at your shoes. You don't reply. Look at your watch discreetly and don't say a fucking word for 20 minutes. Shrink will do everything to find out why you're so fucked up. After 20 minutes, mumble that you ran away from home often. When the shrink asks why, stay quiet for another 10 minutes. Then say you ran away because your dad beat you up. Scarred for life, unstable, allergic to authority... Congratulations, you just got out of the army.

To conclude: you can take any or both of these routes. If I were you, I'd go with the physical method, because it's the easy way out. Personally, I did both. They didn't believe me, they told me I was a liar. Guess what? They could never prove it."

IllegalLifeProTips,f9v4rxm,t3_e6zh4t,1575663123.0,"It really depends on what you did. If it's a financial crime or some kind of fraud, tell the lawyer. They'll find a way around it.

If it's a violent crime, absolutely do not. Whatever they might be saying, lawyers won't represent you the same way if you're guilty.

On the other hand, if everything points to you and you're in deep shit, your best interest is to tell the truth to counsel."
