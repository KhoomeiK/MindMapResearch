Chances are good they think this will only hurt the Republicans."
politics,ffptvq1,t1_ffoerm2,1580105525.0,"The biggest boon the Republicans have, is that most people don't vote. Voter participation in the US is abyssmal, 12% of voters under 34 during presidential elections, less during the midterms. 

All in all the Republican voter base of only 20% of the nation, and getting smaller every year. 

Drastically increasing voter participation kills all their margins, they will never win another election."

Yep, a true right winger."
politics,ffny31d,t1_ffnv261,1580072173.0,"No it's not. The problem has always been the Democratic establishment does not WANT change, they want to argue about identity politics, while maintaining the same economic policy as the Republicans. 

Here's how you do it:

1. Win the Presidency and the Senate. 

2. End the filibuster. 

3. Pass Ro Khanas bill ending gerrymandering and voter supression. 

4. Make Federal Elections a national holiday. 

Done. That's the end of the Republican party, and most of the establishment Democrats. 

Now you pass anything you want with a simple majority."

news,ffjc5qf,t1_ffjb8b6,1579995205.0,"Yeah, this. It's inexcusably lazy. 

If you are afraid a dangerous criminal will ""burn the evidence"", stake him out, arrest him when he goes to the store. 

Or you know, any other example of actual police work. 

The idea of a no-knock warrant, should NEVER be used if there is a possibility of children in the house, and only really if there is eminent reason to think someone is in harm's way, like a kidnapping victim."
politics,ffj7ex0,t1_ffj6l7a,1579992263.0,"Yes. Well, he is second in the polls, so its not totally out there.  

Caucuses are weird, random things can happen. Last time Hillary won by 6 coin tosses."
politics,ffj6eti,t1_ffienhk,1579991563.0,"Yeah, but remember past 15 percent delegates are proportional. 

Which means it's likely to be Sanders, Pete and Biden. Pete and Biden split the centrist vote and Sanders wins. 

Though if Warren stays over 15, which she is likely to do in some Caucuses, it's a four way split. Then Sanders is LIKELY to win, if you by current numbers, but not for sure. Biden or Pete will take some places. 

The worst is if Biden falls below 15, and Warren doesn't. If that happens in too many places, Pete could end up stealing Iowa."
news,ffj5hz3,t1_ffir79w,1579990909.0,"Yeah this, shoot them.     
Even if they announce themselves. Anyone can say ""This is the police"" as they break into your home. Pretty sure it's something most bad guys would do anyway. 

The police needs to stay outside, and give people the chance to actually surrender. 

You know, how they treat rich white people."
