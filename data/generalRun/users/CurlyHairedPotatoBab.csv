PetMice,ffjsym4,t3_eu00g0,1580006100.0,Did you wash your hands before handling? If not it may be the sodium on your hand. Otherwise may be hormones or she's just very affectionate.

cats,fffykoq,t1_fffwgjv,1579894623.0,"I'm not sure if trauma is the right word. I've known her for the past six years, original owners are family friends. She's always been a bit feisty but overall sweet. She just doesn't like anyone in her space. She tends to bite when we walk by her in the hallway or if we pet her for .5 seconds too long."
