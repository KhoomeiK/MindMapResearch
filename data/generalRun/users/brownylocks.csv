dogs,fgnztgx,t3_ez0lj1,1580956542.0,How was he today? If dry and wet are making him sick maybe change the protein source. No i didn’t try a specialist but that was my next step. There’s a holistic vet near me I was going to try and would most likely have started cooking for her myself if the hydrolyzed didn’t work. Good luck.
dogs,fgkkkyz,t3_ez0lj1,1580867728.0,Maybe try dry food? Mine has a sensitive stomach but out the other end.... hydrolized protein is what is working for us. Took over 1.5 years to figure out. Maybe try a different vet or a specialist.

Look for a BPM to MPH calculator online and if you have access to a treadmill on your own you can use your own music to drive your speed. Once you know you can do it, you'll find a beat, a double beat or a downbeat in most songs."

You should ask the front desk staff if any staff is taking the class, and maybe partner with them.  We usually have at least one coach or front desk person taking class with us."

Your sweet baby lived double his lifetime and I don’t regret letting him go when I did. Thinking of you guys, there’s nothing to say to make it easier but just know what a great life your baby had."
orangetheory,fefhbn3,t1_feffg3q,1579056322.0,Thanks for this info! I did 8:18 at practice and I was shocked (usually around a 10:and change) but I’m traveling on Friday!
