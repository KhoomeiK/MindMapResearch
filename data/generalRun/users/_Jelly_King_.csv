failed_Normies,fendt4f,t3_eq1zfa,1579282539.0,"You head shape looks like an upside down lightbulb. Whereas the guy in the middle has a square head which is typically more masculine, and the guy on the right is more triangular (but still kinda ugly). Also, the grooming of your facial hair leaves much to be desired and the hair on their head is groomed as looks put together, but yours isn’t. Alsooooo, their noses are slightly smaller and fits their face, but yours is comparatively larger and moderately unattractive. 

I wouldn’t typically give this kind of criticism to things people can’t change, but I’m seriously tired of seeing this same picture posted *everywhere*.
