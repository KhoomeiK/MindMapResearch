movies,ffadury,t1_ffa4e5o,1579733253.0,"Synopsis of original:

The movie follows the rise and fall of a con manâ€”a story that begins and ends at a seedy [traveling carnival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_carnival). The carnival's barker, Stanton ""Stan"" Carlisle ([Tyrone Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrone_Power)), is fascinated by everything there, including a grotesque [geek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_show), who prompts an observation from Stanton that he ""can't understand how anybody could get so low."" Stanton works with ""Mademoiselle Zeena"" ([Joan Blondell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Blondell)) and her alcoholic husband, Pete ([Ian Keith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Keith)). Once a top-billed [vaudeville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaudeville) act, Zeena and Pete used an ingenious code to make it appear that she had extraordinary mental powers, until her attentions to other men drove Pete to drink and reduced them to working in carnivals. Stanton learns that many people want to buy the code from Zeena for a lot of money but she refuses to sell; she is saving it as a nest egg.

Sounds like they're replacing the seer with a shrink."
