KidsAreFuckingStupid,fgt4b3a,t1_fgsrv5l,1581098757.0,"I very specifically stated that my argument isn't ""new music bad, old music good"". There are plenty of great modern rappers.

My point is that making music is available to everyone now. If you have a computer, you can record an album for free. Because of this, people are self publishing their material at an unprecedented rate. 

You can see the same thing with online publishing of books, using the Amazon self publish system. Most of those books are absolute trash, and no publisher would pick them up. Just like no major label would pick up most soundcloud artists. 

That isn't to say all self published books or albums are bad. But it is very difficult to compete when there are so damn many out there so sift through.

There is a market over-saturation, and it has made it more difficult to find the gems hidden in all of the shit. 

This has nothing to do with ""old rap is better"". There were shit old artists, too. In every era. In every genre. 

I genuinely though hip hop was dumb and talentless until studying Homer. Through that lens I saw it from a different perspective. It may be pretentious, but that is how I discovered how amazing hip hop/rap can be. 

I respect all y'alls opinions. I am simply giving mine. If anything, it is the upvote/downvote system that makes discourse so difficult on here. Once I receive the gold and upvotes, I feel smug and superior, I'll admit it. And when I receive a bunch of downvotes, I get defensive and double down. When people see a comment with a bunch of downvotes, they pile on. Same thing with the ups. Hive mind effect.

Seriously, to both of y'all (/u/fortplant), I'm sorry that my take on this pissed you off. I'm sorry I tore down Lil Peep. I'm sorry I come off as a pretentious asshole (to be fair, I am). I don't want to be an asshole. For real, I wish y'all the best. Sorry this devolved into a pissing match. I'm as guilty, or more so, than anyone."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fgt1dzt,t1_fgsybh8,1581097016.0,"For sure. J Cole is good, especially as a ""middle ground"" rapper. Passing fans of rap and hard core fans agree he is great. Check out the album 2014 Forest Hills Drive.

I'm a big fan of Killer Mike and El-P. They have a duo project called ""Run the Jewels"". They are essentially playing the part of cartoonishly violent Robin Hood type characters. I love it. All of their 3 albums are self titled, all 3 are great.

Killer Mike's solo ""R.A.P. Music is also fantastic, and it was produced by El P. Track ""Willie Burke Sherwood"" is a standout to me. Can't lie, I tear up listening to it. Powerful stuff.

I like ASAP Rocky, but his first album is still his best, to me. The song 1 Train is a great cypher with dope features. 

Freddie Gibbs is great on his own, but he has twice teamed up with legendary producer Madlib to release 2 full albums. They are another level. The lyricism, word play, and music are phenomenal. They did a live NRP Tiny Desk session with a jazz band and it was amazing. For Gibbs to be able to rap over that live really demonstrates his musical skill. 

Black Thought's freestyle is linked in my original post. It is 10 minutes, and features some amazing references. He talks about Jesus and Judas, Cain and Able, Caesar and Brutus, the Tigris and Euphrates, Heaven and Hades, all sorts of classical references and analogies. As a classics nerd, hearing this stuff referenced in a freestyle is dope. He is the rapper for The Roots as well. They are great.

Anderson Paak is a very talented multi-instrumentalist, vocalist, and rapper. He also performed on NRP, where he drums and raps. He's fantastic. 

Big Krit's album 4 Eva is a Mighty Long Time is a great example of modern Southern rap. Southern rap has a flamboyant flair to it, prone to boastful exaggerations. Very colorful, almost cartoonish.

Joey Bada$$ is good too. He's a NY throwback to the OGs. He may be young, but he raps like he's been there since day 1. Truly a student of the game. 

Jon Wayne is weird. He wanted to be a producer, but nobody would rap on his tracks. So he did it himself. Big fat nerdy white guy. Flows hard as fuck.

Vince Staples has some great stuff. Blue Suede is a jam. So is Norf Norf.

I also really enjoy ASAP Ferg, but he isn't exactly... i dunno. I can't say I'd give his work an A+ or anything, but his first album is just an experience. He sets a tone and stays with it. I find it incredible fun."

My argument isn't about any singular artist getting too much exposure, but the industry as whole growing exponentially. Making a track is very easy. If you have a laptop, you have a studio. Hell, Gorillaz made an entire album on an ipad while on tour. 

The point is that when every idiot can release music into the market, we have a lot of shit to cut through. The system used to weed out people. You need to record a demo (gotta pay for studio time), book some local gigs, distribute the demo to labels, network, hope someone picks you up, and then deliver on your debut album. That is no longer necessary. 

That isn't a bad thing by itself. There are plenty of great artists who are self made, self produced, that we would not have otherwise gotten to hear if it were up to the labels. But there is also a lot of trash.

I'd start with his album 30, particularly the first half. The second half is a throwback to XXX where he, for the last time, embraces the druggie party animal that he once was.

Good! I'm happy for you. You were able to relate to it on a level that spoke to you. Plenty of my favorite artists that also helped me through dark times don't have much artistic merit. I love Hawthorne Heights, too. But if I have to judge them objectively, they are trash. I still love em. 

I'm only saying that Lil Peep never made anything that had much artistic merit. It was mostly derivative and sloppy, in my opinion.

It is and it isn't. If you just want the money and radio play and fame, you really don't need to create art rap. 

>It takes skill to tune into a form of expression that resonates with people. If that is mumble rap, so be it.
You don’t have to like it, but the people who do like it aren’t wrong to do so.

I couldn't agree more. That is why I said in my first response to the lil peep fan,

>I can elaborate on why if you want, but if you're a fan thats all good. No disrespect to him, RIP and all that

I didn't plan on tearing him apart and elaborating on the *why*. I am coming at this from a musical theory perspective. 

Reaching the average consumer who doesn't understand musical theory or the history of the art is one thing. Making a statement and progressing the genre is another thing. 

I like all sorts of musical acts that didn't really push they're genre forward. But I'm well aware they aren't some groundbreaking geniuses, and that their music isn't really ""great"". 

I look at music like I look at film. Avengers is fun and all, but it isn't deep or ahead of its time or anything. It can't hold a candle to films like ""Children of Men"" or ""Parasite"". But that is the thing, it was never trying to.

So if you like Avengers or lil peep, there is nothing wrong with that. Critiquing isn't just saying ""I liked it"" or ""I didn't like it"". It is breaking it apart and examining it for what it is. There are plenty of albums and films I consider great that I genuinely didn't enjoy experiencing."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fgsu5uy,t1_fgssvkz,1581092721.0,"> This whole argument is stupid because there have always been shitty, disposable rappers who had popular songs.

I agree, but the difference is computing power and the internet. Making a beat in the 90s was WAY more difficult than it is now. I used to physically cut tapes of drum breaks and try to make my own beats. It was super difficult. J Dilla and MF Doom are insanely talented. So we are now over-saturated. There is so much bad music out there that it can be difficult to cut through it all. 

>How much of the bling era was trash not worth remembering? What about smash hit shit acts like kriss Kross or house of pain?

A ton of it was trash, for sure. Same with the era before it. 

>How much golden age is worth listening to, especially compared to the best works of big daddy Kane, LL, or Ice-T?

Again, agreed. But there was so much less on the market that the best were easy to find. The rap/hiphop section in the record store was like, 25 LPs lol. You talked to your boys and knew who to cop.

>You think drug rap is new? Are you familiar with the myriad trash produced during the gangster craze? Like seriously?

No, I don't think drug rap is new. I think the angle and message has changed. It used to be more about the struggle and the hustle. It has changed more towards blanket glorification. Or course, I'm generalizing. 

>You have very little critical thinking and a superiority complex about your taste.

>I don't like Drake at all, but his songs are some of the most deliberately orchestrated and effortfully written pop rap of all time.

I would credit his producers and ghostwriters for that, but I do agree. 

>Listen to mase in '96 or I shyne by lil pump and tell me he's irredeemably derivative and unable to rap.

I can't. Lil Pump does have some bangers. 

>Bad music has always been popular. Changes in the way music is distributed and produced doesn't magically make older music have more merit

Again, my point isn't that old hip hop was ""Better"" but that the ease of making hip hop today has skewed the market to make it more difficult to cut through the bullshit."

I wouldn't have done it. If you want to refute my points, go for it. Tell me how Lil Peep was actually musically gifted. Maybe he was subverting our expectations or something?

edit: bro stop editing your comments. Mine won't make sense.

I'll now address your edit.

That is the hook of Humble. If you want to break down that song, it also has a lot going on. I'll only analyze 1 line because doing the whole song would be a shitload.

>Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?

Alright, on the surface, he's just tryna eat pussy. Nothing crazy there. But taste bloods? Not taste buds? What is he meaning by taste blood?

To ""taste blood"" is to have a small victory that gives you confidence that may lead you to a triumph. Like drawing first blood. You have the upper hand.

In one of his music videos before this one, there is a still shot that says ""my taste bloods is expensive"", which I think he is probably alluding to in this line. I imagine it may have something to do with the Bloods (gang) as well, as he talks about the Compton street violence pretty often. 

The entire song is a critique of the material culture of modern hip hop. That is why the hook is what it is. He's telling his peers that they should be more humble, not only because their arrogance reflects poorly on the community as a whole, but also because Kendrick is so far ahead of them, that he humbles them. The video makes this clear as well, with the symbolism of him being a king, the pope, and even Jesus at the last supper."

He also seems genuinely menacing. But is he doing crazy rhyme schemes on odd time signatures? Nah. But he doesn't need to. He isn't trying to be the next Radiohead, he's making some somber and deep tracks that hit hard.

Danny adresses his own glorification of drugs in detail. He has an entire album about how drug rap culture, and his part in it, spiraled out of control and nearly took his life. There are plenty of trap artists with substance, I never said otherwise. 

I said people can like what they like, man. I also stated pretty clearly that I am a fan of rappers in each era of this genre. I was just giving my take on why this modern era of rap seems so bad to many people."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fgsrsjp,t1_fgspr5i,1581091287.0,"Fuck it, I'll bite, but only because I found that response insulting.

His word play is nonexistant. He never used double entendres, while his contemporaries like Kendrick use triple entendres regularly. 

His flow is basic 101 at best. He drops his syllables on even measures every time. He had no idea what syncopation was, or how rhyme flows can be twisted and manipulated around a beat. The very art of hip hop is alien to him and his music. Hell, he rarely even follows the most basic of rhyme schemes. Most of the time the end of each bar doesn't even rhyme. You know, like AABB ABAB, or ABAA schemes? He never uses them. I doubt he was aware of them in this context at all.

Since you want to quote the classics, lets take a look at the classics. I actually was a classics major, and Homer's epic poetry is what got me into hip hop. One of my professors was a big hip hop head and I learned a lot from him. The oral traditions of the classics were a LOT like freestyles. They memorized them, but also changed them on the spot depending on crowd reactions. Lots of men in attendance? More battle scene detail. Shit like that. But to make things even more complex, they used dactylic hexameter. This is a meter, a rhythm scheme of sorts. I won't explain it all here, but give it a read. It is quite complex. But these ancient poets were able to do it on the fly. Because of practice and skill. 

Lil Peep's music was a bastardization of an art form and tradition that is very old. He paid no respect to those who came before him, and he learned nothing from them. Or if he did, he did not show it in his music. 

Just break down any of Kendrick's albums and you'll see how many layers there are. There are no layers to Lil Peep. It is all completely one dimensional, surface level, quick and easy music. It requires little to no thought to make or listen to (some of his producers are actually good, tbh).

In short, there are levels to this game. You want to call me out for acting like I know what I'm talking about, but I do. 

I believe this is the Dunning Kruger effect. You know so little about music theory, the history of hip hop, and the history of oral poetry in general, that you *think* it is a simple matter of taste. It is more than that. With truly great music, you can teach a lecture on a single song. You can break things down and examine them from multiple angles. You can see the artist's intent, and how they are conceptualizing the message they are getting across.

Lil Peep's message is brutally banal."

I love old school and new school. 

Big L, Easy E, Wu Tang, Masta Ace, Mos Def, Big Daddy Kane, etc. were from a time where you had to be exceptional to get a shot. There weren't all that many people doing it, and most of them sucked. So when someone like big L dropped [98 freestyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ek7Kts-87Q) live on the radio in NY, it was nuts. He proved he is legit as fuck (RIP).

Now in the newer era, we have guys like Lil Wayne, Kanye West, Pusha T, J Cole, K Dot, Danny Brown etc who also are amazing. There were a lot more people in the genre competing at this point, and the cream was still generally rising to the top. But you can spot guys like Solja Boi being the first to capitalize on the internet and ease of music software. Now teens can make beats and rap to them with a decent amount of exposure. Solja Boi is ass. But he was still popular.

Now we're in the soundcloud era. The market is EXTREMELY over saturated, and for whatever reason, the cream isn't always rising to the top. I believe this is due to personas being more important than the music itself. 

Look at guys like 69, Lil Peep, Lil Xan, Lil Pump, and Migos. Hell, even their names are derivative. Many people in this new era have zero originality and are just jumping on whatever trend seems popular. Their skills, especially all of these ""lil"" rappers, are pretty mediocre at best. 

There was ""nice"" rap, where dudes used to rap about how clean and nice they were. You had gangster rap, where the police brutality and struggles of LA in the 90s were the main focus. You had the cerebral rap of guys like [Black Thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prmQgSpV3fA) and Mos def and Kendrick. Then you got into the vapid and solely material based rap of Migos and Drake. Now we have the purely drug based rap, where nearly every song is just about how many drugs you do. Shocker, these guys are dropping like flies to overdoses. 

Another big factor is the prevalence of beats. They used to be fairly simple loops, where the lyrics, wordplay, and flow took center stage. Now a lot of rap is simply a great instrumental with some garbage on top. And lots of people only like it for the beat. Nothing wrong with that, if you dig it. 

And before someone says ""oh migos are good tho"", no they ain't. They have a handful of decent tracks. But when you release that much material that quickly, it happens. Even a broken clock is right twice a day.

Idk what else to say. Ran into one of my old bosses there, too. Introduced him to my buddy. That’s about all I got."
InfowarriorRides,fgqi5t1,t1_fgq6ate,1581024643.0,"I honestly didn’t expect this reaction. I’m telling the truth. I’d name who I was with, but I don’t want my buddy to get flack for it. 

South Carolina Bernie team. Idk what else I can say to make y’all believe me. I have no hate for Bernie. I was honestly a supporter before this, but his team was so fucking whacko it turned me off from them. 

I was shocked at their opinions and statements. Guess I can’t be too surprised that y’all are, too."
InfowarriorRides,fgq31wu,t3_ezviu4,1581016927.0,"My buddy works for the Bernie campaign, and he was in town with his coworkers, so we all met up at a bar for some drinks. 

Guys. It was insane. I’m on the left and plan on voting for whoever runs against trump, but holy shit, these people were as crazy as any neo nazi or whatever. 

A couple things that they were saying. 

Astrology is real. 

The gulags weren’t even bad. 

Mao was great. 

The Ottoman Empire was the greatest empire ever. 

Islam is responsible for all of the greatest scientific advancements

Vaccines cause autism. 

All of the Hillary murder stuff

Straight white men shouldn’t be able to vote. 

All guns should be confiscated, refusal equals death. 

And some other shit I’m forgetting. It was pretty wild. My friend who works with them is gay, and we’re best buds. So when I could smell a fart, I blamed it on him. I said “because it smells gay”. This is a joke between us, and I think it is just generally funny for its absurdity. Guess how his coworkers responded to that? Not great. 

One person was a man will a full beard. He used xim as his pronoun. Or “they”, either one was cool with him. Or xim. Xi got man when I was like “check this out, bro” or anything like that. 

Another person, woman in her 30s, has multiple Bernie tattoos. She claimed to be over 100k in debt because of devoting her life to the Bernie campaign. 

It was like living in an alternate reality. They were just insane. It might not be fair, but it definitely sapped all support I had for Bernie. 

When we did cheers I also said “Tom 2020” and that didn’t go over well, either. They were just humorless assholes looking for any sign that you were “the enemy”. Weird stuff.

Edit: I am actually telling the truth but ok. South Carolina Bernie Team.

Never been a Trump supporter, never will be. I’ll still vote for Bernie if he is the dem nom."

It is an antiquated term that has taken on a new meaning. Nobody used 1st 2nd or 3rd world to refer to a former political landscape. 

Now 3rd world is just shorthand for “underdeveloped/still developing” nations. 

Like he said, you’re being needlessly pedantic."
books,fgp4ici,t1_fgo1o72,1580996628.0,"This is exactly what I’ve been saying about TV and film!

Take the Netflix Troy show for example. They made Achilles black. Which is just a strange choice. And we’re supposed to just act like we don’t notice?

Instead of taking the only character from the Iliad who is described as having blond hair and making black, make a show about Shaka Zulu or something. The planet is big and diverse. We have lots of history to make shows about. No need to just mix it all together."

You have some weird preconceived notions of collectors."
Charleston,fgn3gg5,t1_fgn2k5g,1580936971.0,"Actually, Jim Crow and slave era stuff is highly collectible. There is a gay couple that has the largest collection in the world. They find it to be a pertinent reminder of how bigoted society can be, and how our material culture reflects that. 

Look, if you collect that stuff because you want to cheer it on, you’re an asshole. But if you’re just fascinated by history and culture, no biggie."
Charleston,fgn1oj8,t1_fgn1eki,1580935990.0,"... what is wrong with collecting ww2 memorabilia? I have a USSR flag from the battle of Kursk, a hitler youth knife, some coins from various nations, an American flag from the era, etc. 

Some people like history and historical items. I find the nazi and USSR stuff the most interesting, personally. I’m not a nazi or a commie. It is just neat. 

I am not as big into the civil war, but it doesn’t seem that weird to me."
AskReddit,fgmy90q,t3_ezauxv,1580934256.0,"Run. Avoid fights.

If that doesn’t work, shell up, protect your head, and just try to not get hurt for about 3 seconds. Most people will gas out from punching for 30 seconds. It is a lot more taxing than you’d think. 

If you can weather the initial storm, just fire back. Nothing fancy. Straights and hooks. Look for opportunity to disengage and get the hell out of there. 

Avoid going to the ground. Grappling is very difficult, and if your opponent knows how to grapple, you are 100% fucked. You will twisted like a pretzel and choked out, or have a limb snapped. Not to mention, going to the ground on concrete just sucks. 

But seriously, avoid fights. People who know how to fight avoid fights too. Because they know violence. If you have experienced it, you understand how dangerous it can be. Especially on concrete and with no refs, 2 guys actually Trying to hurt each other. 

If you have no experience, there really isn’t that much you can learn from reading. It is a lot different once you get hit in the face."

bicycling,fgmj0ff,t1_fgmipw1,1580925546.0,"I honestly find that modern Merckx way nicer than the old one. I like super vintage stuff (like, 60s and earlier) and modern stuff. At least as far as the looks go."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fgmgoli,t1_fgmfpvb,1580924179.0,"Good call. The big problem is that nothing compares. Certain drugs (amphetamines, cocaine) flood your brain will ""feel good"". More than you can get from anything naturally in life.

Then you have the other end of the spectrum (opiates - oxy, heroin, etc) that numb everything and make you warm and like you're floating away. Like world peace just got achieved. No problems exist any more. You are utterly content.

So if you never do drugs, you'll never experience that pure bliss that others have. But the problem with that pure bliss is that you aren't supposed to feel that from doing nothing! That is cheating! You are supposed to be happy from exercise, laughter, friends, loved ones, etc. When you replace it with an artificial substitute, everything gets thrown way out of whack.

So while sex is the greatest high you will get, it really doesn't even compare to what I have felt. It makes it a lot less interesting.

Idk. People are downvoting all of these comments so I guess I'm being offensive somehow."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fgmfl10,t1_fgmdsjq,1580923530.0,"Yeah I guess. Idk. I had a drug addiction as a kid, and I would much rather do drugs than have sex. As far as ""this feels amazing, I'm willing to risk everything for it"" goes, sex isn't up on the list.

MMA,fgmd5pd,t1_fglsiwi,1580922280.0,"Not exactly. His case just made it clear that they needed to change how they dealt with these things.

It isn't that they changed the rules *for* him, but rather because of what his case brought to the forefront of the MMA world. That being, residual levels of PEDs/tainted supplements.

Look, fuck Jon Jones. I will always cheer for his opponent. But the rule change was a good one.

Still, I agree with your second point. He broke the rules at the time, so he should get a full sentence. No retroactive leniency."

MMA,fgmcn6g,t1_fgkemre,1580922018.0,"Soft disagree. In MMA, body shots leave you open to knee counters.

Also, the placement has to be really good with body shots. The liver and solar plexus are the spots to hit, anywhere else and there's a chance your opponent is simply too tough to let it hurt him. See Tyron v Usman for example. Not that Tyron wasn't hurting, but Usman was unable to rock or drop him with body shots, even though he was just racking them up."

It isn't that all of the best designers go into high fashion, it is that all of the best designers go to the best brands. including sportswear. Reebok just isn't one of the best sportwear brands.

I am acknowledging that there are outside issues that I am facing that have led me towards making poor decisions. Alcohol being one of them, in this case.

Is there anything this guy could say to make you believe him? Maybe it is a phrase you don't hear a lot. In the South, ""demons"" or ""the devil"" are used all of the time for ""my own personal issues I am struggling to deal with"". Even non religious folk like me us this phrase."
