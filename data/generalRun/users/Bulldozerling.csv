RotMG,feylczp,t1_feyc567,1579447133.0,"I wanted to include the ST armors as well but the ranking would take me so long because there is so much to look at. 

Some ST sets are broken. I have the ninja st set and it is so much fun, makes Ninja a top 5 class for me.

If there was no archer and huntress in the game, I'd put Nil in S because it really is a great choice for Ninja."
RotMG,fexv4zn,t1_fex7g4k,1579437047.0,Instead of just saying something is bad you could say why
RotMG,fexuwyh,t1_fex9u0u,1579436877.0,"How did I prioritize tankiness in the heavy armors lol? Am I supposed to put fire armor in SS or what? I like some more dps over defense on an archer for example, how does that make me inexperienced?"
RotMG,fes913p,t1_fes6tki,1579362710.0,"I wanted to add them anyway to see what others have to say.

It was hard for me to rank the cores because they aren't really helping you unless you have the right gear, B+ seemed right because they all are useful somewhere. I really like the red one."
RotMG,fermbd8,t1_ferk4nq,1579355713.0,"I agree but it depends on the enemy you are fighting. For me it makes sense to put them in the same rank. Did you ever use a tablet? Maybe check some gameplay, it is insanely good."
RotMG,ferf9pj,t1_feox9d1,1579353225.0,Tablet is one of the most overpowered shit in the game
RotMG,ferez9x,t3_eq6tzh,1579353117.0,"Ray definitely needs to be higher, aswell as EP and void, they are very situational

imo endless torment and flowing clarity are underrated

Water silk is SS, the attack and spd you get from it is great

Resu doesn't deserve A"
RotMG,fera012,t1_feoydfb,1579351604.0,"That's the only good thing about resu, still doesn't deserve B"
CubeWorld,fepcn11,t3_eq8hd9,1579317246.0,"Holy shit...I am lvl 20 and it is a drag lol. Didnt get a single plus item for my class!!!! But like 10 in total for other classes, most of them being weapons

Edit: Is the light radius of 6.5meters a big difference? Mine is about 5 and it sucks"

socialanxiety,fem24dy,t3_epv8ep,1579237261.0,"Honestly, some alcohol and that'd be great. I would show up lol"
socialanxiety,fem1dhq,t3_epubgj,1579236598.0,"First of all, it is great that you have friends and a family that supports you.

If you aren't already, I recommend you dress in a way that makes you feel really comfortable (for me it is just a soft grey shirt and jeans, nothing beats that), exercise and eat healthy because if you are healthy and look good, you will feel good.

Not the best example but when I give a presentation I often start with a simple sentence like ""I am nervous right now"" or ""I am pretty overwhelmed"" and I found that it takes a lot of pressure off of me and some people sympathize with you because they often feel the same way and it can make connecting a lot easier."
socialanxiety,fem066c,t3_epuz6s,1579235565.0,"I know this very well. It is great that you took action and emailed your professor, it is already a step into the right direction.

How exactly would you confront them? Would you ask them why they rated you the way they did or would you say something like ""I am not okay with how you rated me.""? You could just ask a simple question to find out what their reasoning behind the scoring was, they will probably not think much of it because it is a justified question.

If you don't feel comfortable standing up to a group or to a member of the group just go to the teacher and tell her how you feel about it and why you didn't talk to the group first. She will understand you but I think in the end you will have to talk with them anyway.

Maybe start with the person you are most comfortable with talking to or the one that rated you the best because then there is not much room for negativity and you don't have to worry as much. You can slowly work your way up to the more difficult conversation.

Best of luck :)"
