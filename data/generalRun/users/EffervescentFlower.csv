fatlogic,fdtowg0,t3_en29tf,1578719943.0,"I’m smaller than I was in Highschool. My hips are wide, yeah, but they’ve been like that since puperty. At the start of high school. My waist is much smaller (had BED and haven’t binged since 2018). My boobs certainly aren’t bigger. I don’t know about how my old clothes fit because I’m more feminine now and don’t wear them, but I know from weight numbers that I’m smaller."
AskReddit,fds8n8k,t3_emqd57,1578696857.0,"Love, Beauty, and Planet. I have eczema and really fine hair. I paid $59 for a special shampoo and conditioner that used to make my scalp hurt (like someone had yanked my hair hard) and Dove products for sensitive skin. I switched to LBP on a whim and my skin (with cream) got so much better with the Rose and Murmur butter body wash, shower scrub, and hand soap and the shampoos cost $12 dollars and my scalp stopped hurting.
They’re also vegan and environmentally friendly. Easy to make last and smells really good.

Also the girls in the commercials are pretty. That’s less important and much gayer. But also a plus."

college,fdoxdhx,t3_emcq4e,1578615046.0,"Strangely ballsy. I live near campus so I walk my dog along it, and those squirrels are barely bothered by my 55+ lb poodle. If he lunges they’ll run, but only a few yards."
AskReddit,fdn7739,t1_fdm1wcs,1578579164.0,Yeah. I get that! I love the genre so much though!
AskReddit,fdn752p,t1_fdm48zg,1578579122.0,Wolves of Mercy Falls was my jam! I loved the first three with Sam and Grace. Not so much the companion novel(s) with Cole and Isabelle though.
AskReddit,fdn70k6,t1_fdm5a96,1578579026.0,"That’s true. I think part of me favoring YA is that more often it focuses on the discovery and formation of identity. I’m LGBTQ+ myself, and haven’t really been secured in it for too long. YA more often aligns with that.
Also, I love Bookriot. Especially their articles and newsletters!"
AskReddit,fdn6tkx,t1_fdm612e,1578578876.0,Middle Grade too! Every middle grade book I’ve read is just so...readable. It’s not really too simplistic either. There’s just an inherent writing style that I adore.
AskReddit,fdm1uug,t1_fdlyxr2,1578537813.0,"I think it’s just personal preference! It’s good to have an escape, ‘childish’ or otherwise."
AskReddit,fdm1s31,t1_fdlx3sb,1578537762.0,They also are so much easier to get into and not take so super seriously. They manage to tackle issues while also providing escape. They manage to storytell while facing problems.
AskReddit,fdm1mbd,t1_fdltqzt,1578537656.0,"Totally! With the Hunger Games, it wasn’t the death itself that made the story particularly grim (although it was) it was the fact that a government would create such a thing that was so gripping."
AskReddit,fdltn6i,t1_fdlt5yl,1578532219.0,"I also feel like YA Sci-Fi and Fantasy can do ‘dark and grim’ fantasy better. A lot of Adult fantasy relies on a lot of blood and gore, I feel like YA does a good job of balancing out blood and gore and coming up with more darkness in characters and mythology rather than in how many people can die."
AskReddit,fdltdsr,t1_fdlq0ad,1578532042.0,Yeeessss. I love YA fantasy and sci fi. So much creativity.
AskReddit,fdlgsoh,t1_fdl1ffr,1578523697.0,I also find it more relatable too. Adult books often have heroes way older than me (23) or are going through issues I don’t relate to. They’re also not super diverse either. LGBTQ+ lit is much more prevalent and driven by OWN voices. A lot more entertaining too without being overly grotesque.
AskReddit,fdkwljk,t3_eluiqj,1578512658.0,"ASL or Braille, I'm getting a degree in Secondary History, resources can be stretched thin and hard of hearing/sight kids can often get left in the dust and have higher drop out rates. Maybe I could help some kids and bridge the gap from lack of personnel."
AskReddit,fdkwd8x,t3_elm4th,1578512523.0,"My dog. Definitely. He's priceless.

And a lot of things given to me by family. Even when they stop working, it still has emotional value. Especially from my brothers. I love them so much. They always know what I like and look out for me. The older one and the younger ones. There's no price on them."
AskReddit,fdkw1ls,t3_elu6v5,1578512333.0,Young Adult novels. I love them so much. I'm getting into New Adult somewhat but I love YA plots so much more.

college,fclk6cc,t1_fclk1qk,1577749693.0,Also. A lot of schools are built in cities or suburbia. Which further limits space and ups real estate costs.
thatHappened,fclecd7,t1_fcjwc03,1577745835.0,"I counter with: Yorkie. My neighbor has one and he once tore his ACL chasing my poodle around (apparently very angrily and unprovoked). To be fair, my dog thought they were playing because he has no social awareness and thusly gets on some dogs’ nerves but the tenacity it takes to chase a dog who’s got 60 lbs on you is stunning."

It helps me write lesson plans for my various assignments and cuts out some research. Some of them have to be 90 minutes worth of material and having multiple due in a week on top of history papers just makes having my old stuff worth it."
