tamagotchi,fgw350c,t1_fg7guvr,1581156111.0,Welcome to the community!
tamagotchi,fgi8pb9,t3_eyl8qa,1580811473.0,I love your mix they are too adorable for words. Except for one......awwwwww!
powerrangers,fgi8n1d,t1_fgi5uil,1580811379.0,I hope your not denying yourself Beast Morphers because that is truly a great season as well!
depression,fg8fiqj,t3_exfn0o,1580617971.0,This is inspiring. Although I'm an old man of 34 I still have some interest in getting into martial arts but I'm worried I'm too old for it so I'm glad you had the courage to do something new. I will however return to the YMCA after a month long absence due to letting depression get the best of me to the point I nearly quit the gym membership. Instead I'll just keep paying the bill so I can continue to go. I need to beat my depression somehow but I still wish I had the courage for martial arts though.
supersentai,ffuczo4,t3_euu3de,1580239371.0,"I personally love ToQger. The trains, the suits, and the ability to transfer colors allowing for female red rangers and male pink rangers! I just love that ability."
depression,ffuct3m,t3_ev78hz,1580239261.0,"I certainly never heard of anyone with depression claim that life is short so you should live it to the fullest so I agree with this post 134%. Life is long, life is lonely, life is hard, life is next to impossible to have even one happy moment that I feel life will only deny me."
penis,ffu8o3e,t3_ev01rd,1580236813.0,Damn your beautiful. I can't wait for your next thirty five pics as your first was such a steamy success!
tamagotchi,ffss0k3,t3_euwsc2,1580190358.0,I have one too but the other shell design so from personal experience I can proudly tell you your going to love it.
tamagotchi,ffqz9c1,t3_eup4w3,1580146976.0,Considering we had no seasonal animations at all for December nope. It's not annoying me at all as in fact I'm glad seasonal animations have made it's return. It was a sad day when I went a whole month without a seasonal animation as I'm a fan of those.
tamagotchi,ffppnhc,t1_ffppjkq,1580101382.0,Pretty much which is why I just raise and care for my Tama. I rarely intentionally have my Gudetama eaten although I have done this before just because I wanted to experience different dishes and characters.
tamagotchi,ffph2er,t1_ffpf3gn,1580094870.0,"This tamagotchi is based on the Japanese mascot Gudetama who is a lazy egg. It's the same as other Tamagotchi in terms of the raising a pet gameplay but it's different as it does not have all the features that a regular Tamagotchi has. It does not have a menu, there is no child or teen stages as it starts as a baby (Yudetamago) straight to adulthood after twenty four hours (Gudetama) and the purpose is to see all the death screens which there is at least twenty of them which each one is a different egg dish. Basically your going to have to let your Gudetama get eaten when a pair of chopsticks attacks your Gudetama (although there's no guarantee that it will take your Gudetama the first time). Your Gudetama will be sent to the microwave to be cooked into a meal and you will get a different egg dish meal as a result. Although you don't have to do this as you can save your Gudetama by pressing the A button."
supersentai,ffp9vvv,t3_eubxib,1580089788.0,This is true. Lol. But I actually love the dancing at the ending credits as I find them quite entertaining.
tamagotchi,ffntza7,t1_ffn4bwo,1580070794.0,It's actually 2pm. I know because it did that at 2:00pm just a half an hour ago.
depression,ffn2ul3,t3_eu2h1f,1580061421.0,That's not true...because I'm wishing you the best for your brand new year of life that will give you a lot of adventure. Happy Birthday! :)
tamagotchi,ffb7ozt,t1_ffaiz8k,1579754163.0,They do grow up fast don't they. My Tama will be eleven years old tomorrow and quite frankly it doesn't feel like it has been that long.
tamagotchi,ffb7j0s,t3_esil3s,1579753985.0,I'm a 34 year old male who didn't get his first Tamagotchi shell until I was 33 years old. In fact as of next month it will be my one year anniversary of becoming a Tamagotchi caretaker for the very first time. I want to celebrate it by getting my first Japanese language shell known as the Morino. And no I don't speak a word of Japanese but I can look up English translations online.
tamagotchi,ff3l1ba,t1_ff3kzbe,1579543308.0,Your welcome. I almost forgot myself lol.

AskReddit,fepc7si,t1_fen9uh2,1579316963.0,I don't need to comment because you just did it for me. Thanks
Life,feiz2kf,t3_ep94hd,1579151280.0,I wish I was taught about mental health as that could have possibly saved me from having my entire twenties destroyed. And part of my thirties as well but I'm recovering. Point is I had depression for over a decade and it took several years to realize my self destructive behavior that I saw as normal wasn't. Mental illness such as depression should be taught in schools. Especially these days.
