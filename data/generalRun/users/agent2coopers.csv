awfuleyebrows,fem96ql,t3_epsz8i,1579244400.0,Someone’s really protective of those brows. Like maybe the owner of them.
UnsolvedMurders,fem92mh,t1_fem11a0,1579244267.0,I feel like it was him. Or his creepy friends trying really hard to make it look like him. Or all three of them.
SkincareAddiction,fem8khw,t3_eps4gl,1579243695.0,A constant struggle of mine. I wish you all of the luck.
aerialsilks,feeg1gv,t1_fed99km,1579033010.0,"So, all of the points at my studio are rigged that way, I thought that was the norm! Could you ask the studio to give you a fixed point?"
aerialsilks,fecvytg,t1_feclvh2,1578986787.0,"Is it carabiner, swivel, carabiner? Or is something else going on? Sorry, I just want to make sure I understand."
psych,fe6qi3e,t1_fe3i7k0,1578900659.0,"I am also obsessed with Twin Peaks, it’s my happy place. I already loved Psych so much but then this episode really just sealed the deal."

WeWantPlates,fe10gtl,t3_enl7oj,1578821092.0,I find this wildly upsetting.
insomnia,fe0zlkb,t3_enkzom,1578820805.0,"On the days that I have social interactions, such as exercising or whatever, I usually end up staying up through that night and don’t fall asleep until the following morning. I’m glad this has worked for you, though! It’s always nice to find solutions."
insomnia,fe0y5m9,t3_enktt3,1578820174.0,"Yes, I have no memory of a time when I could sleep. I do remember getting frustrated with my little sister when I was around 5, because we shared a room and she was out like a light in just a few minutes. In high school I took a lot of OTC sleep aides, which sometimes worked. Now, it’s 3 am and I’m wide awake, after multiple prescription sleep aides. Its extremely irritating."

EARONS,fe09jt7,t1_fe0966t,1578806900.0,"Agreed. It’s just such a weird case, I would love nothing more than to have a name and a face."
cats,fe0958w,t3_enfhft,1578806532.0,I have the very opposite problem. I’m like throwing elbows (kidding I would never) to keep mine from getting in with me.
EARONS,fe07mhd,t1_fe053fy,1578805212.0,"Can someone clear this up for me, because I was under the impression that they did have touch DNA but there is no way to say for sure that it came from Zodiac. Am I remembering this wrong, or did I forget another DNA contribution?
Edit: to fix my weird ass sentence structure."
slowcooking,fe079ba,t3_ene0bd,1578804910.0,I always feel like I just cannot season beef stew properly. It’s never bad but it’s also never great.
psych,fe02mxg,t1_fdzres9,1578801529.0,Yeeessssssssss! Thank you! James Rodays love for TP is one of my favorite things.

muacirclejerk,fdzvwj0,t1_fdz2eyt,1578797056.0,Kate’s shadow is markedly more intense?
aerialsilks,fdz8g3i,t3_enfn0i,1578787683.0,"I guess it depends on your strength? I couldn’t have climbed silks in socks at first, but I can now. Also your studio might have rules about it. I have never liked my feet but after being in Aerial for a while I stopped even thinking about it because everyone is barefoot all of the time. Good luck!"
psych,fdylgcr,t3_en1qvy,1578781079.0,So good! Though my favorite is the Dual Spires/Twin Peaks into will always be my favorite.
bipolar,fdyklbw,t3_en9ybg,1578780761.0,"I honestly never know I had a hypomanic episode until after the fact. It’s so much like just being functional for me. Mania is extremely obvious, but, of course, when it’s happening I don’t exactly hate it. I wish I had some advice, other than getting sleep. I can throw myself into hypomania basically at Will, by not sleeping. If you are able to take a sleep aide or talk to your doctor about it, I would highly recommend. For me the entire situation seems to revolve around my sleep and activity level. My body will literally kick into hypo if it knows it has to power through something, like an extremely long week."
bipolar,fdxqg7p,t3_en8455,1578771812.0,I feel this reallllll hard.
bipolar,fdokrlt,t3_elp4jy,1578607131.0,"I am so sorry, that is a lot. I am glad you are out of your wheelchair and on the mend. I hope you get some sunny days soon. I am an aerialist and I am often around 20ft in the air, which is a scary height, I can only imagine what a 30ft fall is like. I’m so glad you are okay."
