netflix,fbo2jle,t1_f0i7ndn,1577005958.0,"The comment of a sheep. When you pay 300+ dollars for a console with such rudimentary capabilities, you have a right to complain. Nintendo has always been like this. They restrict their fanbase whenever possible, whether it be: Online play, lag, lack of voice chat without a fucking phone, no Netflix, lack of cross-play, getting DLC late or just no DLC at all compared to PS4/Xbox One counterparts, less dev involvement with updates/patches, etc etc."
