Look, you really need to get your act together if you think this remotely has any impact whatsoever.  This is not a protest, it's faffing about as though it does anything.

It's amazing how quickly in like 3 generations people went from mass gathering, riots, peaceful but very much armed marches, and more in the western world, to thinking whatever the hell the OP is is going to change anything.  It's actually downright incredible how quickly people were defanged not via removing guns (though yeah, you guys fucked that one in AUS), but by culturally shifting the definition of protest and change away from real impact to visibility, as though they are equivalent.

pathofexile,ff38eiu,t1_ff358q9,1579536126.0,"50 is still really low, the EV is great for stacked decks but the variance is very high, so you need to open hundreds for you to be confident you made your return.

I've opened about 6-700, and in those gotten the ilevel 100 elder bone helmet last league (~8 ex or something), and a doctor this league.

That's a lot of fluff around the returns."

pathofexile,ff3544p,t1_ff337p4,1579533896.0,"Have you tried playing a BA build with a mediocre budget?  You actually can't stop attacking because your attack speed is so slow, you can barely keep up the debuff stacks which account for 66% of your damage.  Which is pitiful because it's way harder to scale hit based ignite than attack hits on the same budget.

I can make the same arguments you can."

And yes, you use point blank.  Congrats, don't try to offscreen the boss, but also don't facetank him.  You deal slightly less damage but don't have to eat everything.

Apparently this is more of an issue of hyperbole or a complete misunderstanding of how the build works than the build, which is what I was calling out from the start."

There was even a time someone paid for a service that would auto downvote me 5 times for 2 months, regardless of content or even subreddit.  At least that one was more novel than the death threats."
