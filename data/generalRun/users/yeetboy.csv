BeAmazed,ff866m0,t1_ff85hhy,1579667100.0,"No, there are definitely taller gymnasts, but they’re not as common. For example, Nadia Comaneci is 5’4” and is one of the all time greats. More recently, McKayla Maroney (the smirking gymnast meme) is 5’3”. 

But I would imagine that being shorter makes things like tumbling significantly easier, so shorter gymnasts are more likely to be more successful. 

Compare it to basketball. Most players are extremely tall, but there are exceptions (eg. Muggsy Bogues). But it’s not like they were bred and made into very tall people, their height gives them an advantage so they’re more successful. Shorter players just don’t make the cut, just like in gymnastics taller gymnasts typically don’t. There’s nothing sinister here, it’s just genetics making someone more successful at an activity."
