australia,fekyb7s,t3_ephf4u,1579210123.0,"This brings back memories of my neighbour‚Äôs old dog, also named Charlie and also a (mini!) Schnauzer. Except Charlie was short for Charlotte. Of course almost nobody - mostly us kids - ever realized she was a girl dog because of that Schnauzer ‚Äòstache and the childhood mentality of ‚Äúall dogs are boys and all cats are girls‚Äù that seemed to be prevalent in us young ‚Äòuns. 

One of my earliest memories is of being in the play park and one of the other neighbourhood kids moving the bow clip from on top of Charlie‚Äôs head to her collar, saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs where the bow goes on boys!‚Äù, and the look of part dejected frustration and part amusement on Charlie‚Äôs owner‚Äôs face."

The first few times after she started sleeping in my room I just thought I was hearing my dad snoring through the walls.

Kiddo can do no wrong, is their precious golden child and hope of the family line, etc.

todayilearned,fcsqvyj,t1_fcsosbv,1577922824.0,"The 1936 Berlin Games were notable in a lot of ways, and not just for who was in charge of Germany. 

It was the first time the Parade of Nations was done, the first time there was a torch relay. Jesse Owens broke records and racial barriers and struck up a genuine friendship with fellow trackstar Carl ‚ÄúLuz‚Äù Long, one that lasted after the Games, through letters, up until Long‚Äôs death during the WW2 Allied invasion of Sicily. 

From Carl Long‚Äôs Wikipedia page:

>Long served in the Wehrmacht during World War II, having the rank of Obergefreiter. During the Allied invasion of Sicily, Long was killed in action on 14 July 1943. He was buried in the war cemetery of Motta Sant'Anastasia, in Sicily. He was survived by two sons, Kai-Heinrich and Wolfgang. Kai was born on 13 November 1941 and Wolfgang was born on 30 May 1943, but died on 6 March 1944.

>Long and Owens corresponded after 1936. In his last letter, Long wrote to Owens and asked him to contact his son after the war and tell him about his father and ""what times were like when we were not separated by war. I am saying‚Äîtell him how things can be between men on this earth"". After the war, Owens travelled to Germany to meet Kai Long, who is seen with Owens in the 1966 documentary Jesse Owens Returns to Berlin, where he is in conversation with Owens in the Berlin Olympic Stadium. Owens later served as best man at Kai Long's wedding."
