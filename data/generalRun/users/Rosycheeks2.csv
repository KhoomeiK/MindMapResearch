Holy shit this is exactly what I’m going through right now. I had to sit down and talk to one of my friends today about my depression. Explain that it’s nothing personal, to be patient with me, validate my feelings, keep inviting me to things even if you think I won’t go, etc. It’s gotten easier over time to explain my feelings and vocalize my needs. It’s hard  enough as it is to maintain friendships in your thirties without damn depression holding you down. But, I’ve just accepted that it’s a part of my life now and just need to learn how to manage it better. And remind myself that some days just suck and hope tomorrow is better :) 

I’m really tired rn so this didn’t come out as eloquently as it did in my head, lol. I hope it made sense! Anyways, thanks for your comment it really resonated with me, and I couldn’t leave it unanswered."
