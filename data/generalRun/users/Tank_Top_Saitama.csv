videos,ffwlxei,t3_evm8d2,1580305072.0,You missed the part where every single joke of the video will be repeated in the comments as if we didn't just watch the same video.
thefighterandthekid,fftkzvx,t1_ffth2h7,1580223261.0,"Thanks man, it's so hilarious these ""homeless cats"" crying over Ari. Like they literally shit over Schaub, his wife and even his kid daily, but OMG don't you DARE insult my dead idol. They are literally Karens at a Comedy Store who cry over a *joke* because they feel personally attacked. These cats should just quit this sub, they belong into r/JoeRogan  
  
PS: Also many people on this sub are incel racists."
thefighterandthekid,fftkveo,t1_fftft1x,1580223175.0,"He never said it was funny, maybe he wanted outrage and he got what he wanted. Any PR is good PR. And you are his tools."
thefighterandthekid,fftkji4,t1_fftff25,1580222940.0,"See, I love this logic. ""I'm all for free speech, BUT <*i feel offended so this should be validated as free speech*>. Same bs as ""*I'm not racist, BUT*""   
  
I've already said I don't agree with Ari and I don't like his comedy, but I also don't give a shit if your feelings are hurt because your dad was an Eagles fan the same way I wouldn't give a fuck if your dad died in the military and you're offended by a Bill Burr joke. It's this typical ""I love comedy as long as it's not directed at me/I feel personally attacked"". 

Typical outrage over bullshit."
thefighterandthekid,fftkb00,t1_fftd643,1580222769.0,I think you missed my point entirely. Like absolutely.
thefighterandthekid,fftk9la,t1_ffthuun,1580222741.0,I know.
thefighterandthekid,fftaht7,t3_ev20u4,1580214431.0,"Very cool story, B. Anything else Ching?"
thefighterandthekid,fftafhl,t3_euzee5,1580214364.0,Because he reads comments here.
thefighterandthekid,ffta9zr,t1_ffst98v,1580214205.0,"Not sure if this is true. But who can really tell, because in the beginning nobody knew her, you know, but then more and more heard about her I think?"
thefighterandthekid,ffta4jy,t1_fft56n3,1580214047.0,"Edit: No, he had like 260k or something around this number, somebody took a screenshot right when he posted. You confuse this with Insta, where he has 460k or so."
thefighterandthekid,fft9wy1,t3_ev4bi0,1580213822.0,"Fair enough. I don't like the guy, so I just don't follow him. But I get his point, EVERYBODY is like ""KOBE SUCH A LEGEND"", even people who never watched any Basketball or mentioned him before. It's not my kind of humor, but free speech and all > cancel culture."

thefighterandthekid,fft4qhu,t3_ev1h64,1580207026.0,"Well, he lost tons of followers, now he set it to followers only and gains a ton back I imagine"
thefighterandthekid,fft4nka,t1_ffsu1dx,1580206902.0,"He literally just interrupted Callen's take on it, repeated his stuff like a parrot, then regurgated the same shit after Callen was already dont with the part."
thefighterandthekid,fft4k01,t1_ffstx1c,1580206751.0,"""I've gotten some texts from comedians""  
-""Yeah B, I've awlso gawwtn LAWDS of tekks man, so many!"""
thefighterandthekid,fft4hns,t1_ffsvys9,1580206652.0,"No, he said it like 12 times. Just for clarification though: Ari has been nice to Schabe, no?  
  
Bonus points for: ""Man, my homies were Callen, Rogan, D'Elia etc., Ari already moved to NY"". Haha, instantly distancing from him, but 100% would be fake best friends with him if he came into the studio a second later."

TheMandalorianTV,ffqj7ok,t3_euh5ad,1580136091.0,"No, there were literally 10s of posts when the episode originally aired. And you are never the only one of anything. I have spoken."
thefighterandthekid,ffoxt9d,t3_eubrc1,1580083147.0,It's probably just dextrose

videos,ffoo654,t1_ffnthon,1580079821.0,"Or like a tick for Tourette people. ""Hey, what's the worst thing I could say?"" And then it's in your head. And then you think about it. And then it suddenly pops out."
