cats,ff41rxk,t1_ff39fa4,1579553669.0,"No doubt there's merit to your point of taking precautions especially with fecal waste as your neighbors found out. I grew up with cats getting on counters etc and currently have one that gets up there though I don't loose sleep over it.  Regular cleaning as needed and not letting food touch the counter should be sufficient, if you think too hard about germs you'll lock yourself in a clean room somewhere. Consider that an animal licks their butt, self grooms their fur then sheds that fur which floats all through your house. Hantavirus is a respiratory disease commonly seen  in arid areas where outdoor fecal matter desiccates and gets blow around in the wind for you to breathe in and imbed in your lungs....now your not sleeping...."
