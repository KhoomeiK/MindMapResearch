I thought it was a joke like do you kill 5 or do you take out all 6 because we are making a joke about killing people.  How are we supposed to assume that it stops after the one person.

I see in JacobNails post below that it gives different results than the regular 5 v 1 test  possibly because it involves intentionally using another human being as a means to save 5.  It amazes me that people get hung up on that.
