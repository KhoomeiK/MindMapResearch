As someone who works not in the game industry but software... no sane company is going to put out software and think it will last forever. We build software to die so when it dies or becomes obsolete we can build a better one. This same concept works for games.

BSG is a RU studio, when you read their post about setting up servers... chances are they aren’t setting up the servers themselves.

They probably rent servers at a data center or server warehouse in typical hot spots like Dallas or Chicago etc. So when a server gets full they have say 20 more rented and pay for X amount of bandwidth, computing power etc. 

The issue is that every time more players want to play or buy the game they contact the service for a request to upgrade by 5 more or 10 more. Maybe they have to buy packages that far exceeds or just have poor long term goal commitments for the cost so they’re probably being careful to not purchase unnecessary services.

There are other variables at play too. Does the service need notice and time to implement more servers etc. There can be wait time after a request had gone in, for example it’s 2 am on the east cost maybe server increase requests get implemented with 24 hours. Of course I could be completely wrong because there’s more than one way to architect their infrastructure for the game."

Every decision you make improves or helps you first and to entertain this idea even further we can say in the short term, a pet helps your stress levels and in the long term, a pet can be given to a shelter when it no longer meets your needs.

If we apply the scenario of a student then the education system is unethically stressing students out. Therefore students in the short term choose to buy a pet to cope. In the end only to leave the pet behind when they've graduated. In all these scenarios, everyone and everything behind the reasonings can be seen as unethical, immoral and short-sighted. But we can also imply that everyone/thing here is doing what benefits them i.e. schools need to be profitable or be credible = stress, students need a degree for job = pet for coping, and being short-sighted = solve the problem now.

I don't see a problem with your suggestion but not all of us use the scav to pick up random loot and must need a bag. Hence, why I say it's up to you how to play with a scav's rng loadout.

Either way, this issue you're having is a very minor which can be easily overcome in multiple different ways. If your scav is on a timer, then run your PMC. Making money/gear is one of the easiest thing to do in tarkov. It's actually the main thing you do in tarkov over and over.

In this specific scenario, you believe to be a flaw in design? You can always beeline your scav with its free loadout straight to an extract and there you go, no backpack needed, no fighting needed, no scavaging needed and 100% free loot/money. Sure, someone might see you and kill you but wouldn't this have happened anyways with a backpack or not?

EscapefromTarkov,fdhwdbv,t3_elgglu,1578431352.0,"Losing stuff in EFT is hardly like losing stuff in Rust. If we compare them, EFT is much more forgiving/softcore compared to Rust's game mechanics. I don't know if R6 is comparable period. 

The game isn't as hard as people make it out to be. For the most part, EFT is a looter shooter where death results in a soft? hardcore death where you just lose all your items. Everything else is your same ole same ole FPS with its spin on things. Plenty of games have gun building, survival mechanics, extracting mechanics and similar gunplay, etc."
college,fdhfl9v,t3_elcmhp,1578421607.0,"It really depends on your situation.

If you absolutely need to work for necessities then you should prioritize work over school. As no money means no school, no meeting the bare minimum to survive means no school, etc.

However, if you're just working to have some side money then school should be your priority.

If you're in the middle then I would say C's are good enough and focus mostly on work. Work experience will ultimately be more valuable later on when job searching."
answers,fdhdi0m,t3_elc1wc,1578420416.0,YT is still that but it has more professional content creators that understand monetization now. Although you've blanketed and seem to be gatekeeping anything after the 2010s... it's simply not true that there isn't content on there from people who are genuine about their work. Maybe you're aging or getting older and you're experiencing the mid-life crisis where you're reminiscing about what you personally liked that went out of style or used to think was good but is now not the norm.

You post a random question on a open forum call reddit just like those streamers are playing games on twitch. So let’s ask you the same question you’re asking about the streamer?

Why are you posting here? It seems like people responded a couple times to you and you just want answers? I don’t see the reason why you would ask a question? What is this reddit posting question appeal? You just seem like a normal person posting on reddit, no hate?

So my point is you think the ‘streamer’ must be doing something unappealing yet you are posting an unappealing question as well. So you must have felt that if you posted a question on reddit then people would answer your question? So why can’t the streamers with 80k viewers just stream the game if people are watching?
