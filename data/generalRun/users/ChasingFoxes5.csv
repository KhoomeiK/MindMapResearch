progresspics,ffb3x5e,t1_ffawwnk,1579751147.0,I'm not positive but they look very similar to my Soda heeled combat boots. I got them on Amazon for less than $30!
whatisthisanimal,ff7kvzv,t3_es2xh3,1579651972.0,"Is that flour? I've been trying to compare it to opossum and raccoon but neither seem to match- the toes seem too separated to be a cat, but the size matches up. Cats also step their back feet where their front foot was, so their tracks look different. I'm a little stumped here!"
whatisthisanimal,fevowhl,t3_eqow69,1579399791.0,Yeah I'd say raccoon or badger- both can be found in Texas!

BlackPeopleTwitter,ferpvin,t1_fer8r31,1579356988.0,"As a current Zoology Pre-vet major, zoology is a kind of niche degree to have if you aren't entering vet school with it. Your best bets are research and animal care, like zoos or rehab facilities, all of which are oversaturated I believe. Add on the competitiveness of the animal/veterinary world, if you don't have near perfect grades and/or direct work experience with animals (which you often need the degree to GET), you're far less likely to find a career."

whatisthisanimal,feif68j,t1_feif0xd,1579137095.0,"It's elongated muzzle, large canines, and the shape and length of the carpals/metacarpals make me think it's a canine, but I could be wrong. I work with live animals, rarely skeletons lol"
