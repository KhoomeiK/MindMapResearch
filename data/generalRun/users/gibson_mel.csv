No, the benefits are not good compared to larger companies.  Apply to some Fortune 500 companies.  We have much better pay than MSPs (most of my guys are paid 6 figures) and better benefits for regular employees. These benefits include, but not limited to:

* Annual bonus up to 35% of your salary
* A pension plan (we still have a good one)
* Up to 8 weeks of vacation (the ""unlimited"" ones are just a scam)
* Tuition reimbursement (they paid for my Master's)
* 8% match on 401(k)
* Up to 3 weeks of sick leave
* 15 paid holidays
* 9-5 hours with no overtime away from family
* Work from home or remote available
* Paid training (they paid for my CISSP)
* Paid volunteer days
* Paid jury duty
* Paid financial leave (meet with your advisor, set your budget, etc.)
* Paid bereavement leave
* Paid long term disability
* Paid short term disability
* Paid life insurance
* Paid military Reserve leave (they make up the difference)

I've probably forgotten a few.  I've been in IT/InfoSec for 30+ years.  I've worked for MSPs, mom-and-pop shops, and Fortune 500 organizations.  The incredible F500 atmosphere is beyond comparison to the others."
