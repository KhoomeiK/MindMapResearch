Now imagine one of your friends mailing you a photo of themselves crying wearing a jersey of an athlete who just passed and a note explaining his feelings and sadness.

You have to have a sense of humor especially on Reddit when it comes to giving Brazil a hard time.  It’s a big target given the glaring ineptitude of your politicians.  We see the worst parts of Brazil on the tv. The favelas, the corruption, the crime.   Here in the States we make fun of a state named New Jersey.  Even though the vast majority of it is very beautiful.   But the few places like Newark, Paterson, Trenton, New Brunswick, are enough to warrant shitting on that place for eternity.  Especially if you’re a New Yorker.   

So in closing because of a few bad eggs the majority of the world thinks Brazil is a rancid shit hole.   And try as hard as you may. Nothing is changing the court of public opinion."
