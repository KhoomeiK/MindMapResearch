Another factor is the energy hitting the earth isn't uniform, so heating of the planet happens in different places. 

More importantly though the changes are happening far faster then they've changed in the past. 

For example during the  Pleistocene epoch (2 million years to 14,500 years ago) pretty much straddled an ice age, which went from 125,00 years ago to 14,500.

Glacial maximum was approx 33,000 years ago with maximums approx 26,000.

Deglacialification began though 19,000 with the iceage ending around 14,500 (which nicely coincides with the beginning of the Samaritan and Egyptian cultures).

Nonetheless it took approx 4,000 years for the global temperature to change.

Modern temperatures increases are happening at far higher rate then this. We've gone basically almost 2c in just over 100 years. 

This causes several problems. Fauna and flora cannot adapt fast enough. And the intensity of positive feedback loops is far higher.

This is dangerous for us because one. Permafrost is melting, releasing methane faster then bacteria can absorb it.

Secondly fresh water is disrupting ocean currents and conveyors. This is causing acidification on a scale far faster then previous acidification. 

The creatures that we depend on to produce the air we breath need the oceans to be certain PH in order to reproduce.

You wanna shit all over me with crap in caps expressing exaggeration hyerpbole but it's clear you don't know shit. 

The only reason why people who use street heroin suffer medical problems isnt the heroin but the agents the drugs are cut with or chemicals they use to make it injectable . Black tar heroin is in actual fact a base hence why people use lemon juice (which is bat shit fucking insane) to convert the base into a salt. This causes huge problems. 

Why is the heroin so dirty. Because of the war on drugs and the refusal of the state to regulate it. 

At the end of the day, you give a person either pure oral, or IV heroin and there will be no damage to their liver, or kidneys.

In fact there are almost no other prescription medicine that is as safe as heroin, morphine. The LD50 of medical grade heroin is so high that in palliative care its next to impossible to overdose and kill a patient. 

The only exception to that is the synthetic opiod fentanyl which is extremely potent when mixed with horse tranquillisers which is the root cause of the vast majority of ""overdose"" deaths in America. 

Even then it's not fent that's do it but rather another substances. 

A review done of overdose deaths  found that the vast majority of people who had a cause of death marked as a heroin overdose had in fact died of other causes. The fact of the matter is medical examiners are extremely over worked and the GC/MS tests required to actually quantify and identify all the drugs found are very expensive. 

They only test for things that are cheaply and quickly testable.

The conservatives response to heroin is toxic. It's they who have built the massive police state, a bunch of useless fucks who get promotions and rewards for never ending busts, arrests and drugs on tables.

And yet people keep becoming addicts and our response is to kick them when their down, call them dirty junkies, defund access to life saving services

I've calculated in my country alone we have wasted in the past 20 years almost 1 trillion dollars on the war on drugs.

That's a country of 20 million. Times it by 12 and that's how much the US has wasted (probably more coz you guys waste far more on law enforcement then we do).

And what have you got show for it. Tens of thousands dying every year from overdoses, hundreds of thousands of non fatal overdoses that cause irrevocable damage (brain damage, memory problems), huge amounts of property crime and a never ending cycle of prisons, despair and failure.

If 10% of that money was spent on legalised drug services where patients received doses via a clinic, that had enough consuellors to actually help (and not have massive patients loads that aren't sustainable) then people would get takeaways and support as they hit milestone like employment, training, paying bills/managing their finances, resolving broken family relationships.

All those steps they would get takeaways until they were ready to reduce their doses and quit opiates in their own time and pace.

No more fent in drugs, no gang and street crime, no more authoritarian polices forces using drugs as an excuse to exercise racist policies.

The cost and consequences of diverted methadone was next to nothing compared to the life's saved and the huge reductions in expenditure. 

For legalised heroin considering that most addicts were selling the methadone to get heroin its extremely unlikely that they would sell their dose (hydromorphone) to get street heroin

microsoft,ff27clj,t1_fezoszk,1579495902.0,"Ok, so to paraphrase that definition

Although Carbon Dixode is not toxic in sufficent quantities it can have far ranging effects. Carbon dioxide is currently produced as a waste product from the combustion of fossil fuels, due to the large volume expelled since industrialisation it has caused large then normal amounts of sunlight to become trapped within the earth's surface via the greenhouse effect, instead of allowing it to escape back into space. 

This along with other gases, such as methane, has caused since industrialisation a clear trend of increased temperatures across the oceans and  atmosphere. 

This in turn has disrupted atmospheric and ocean based circulation systems. The gulf stream for example has decreased by 30% since 1957 as a result of large amounts of fresh water from melted polar ice entering the northern seas. 

The disruption of these seasons has caused unseasonal cold weather in various areas whilst in others unseasonable drought and low rainfall.

Dude who got hit in the face:

> For two or three days the pain was almost unbearable; I couldn’t work or sleep, then it was pretty bad pain for another fortnight or so. The stinging persisted for two years and recurred every time I had a cold shower. ... There's nothing to rival it; it's ten times worse than anything else.[9]"
OpiatesRecovery,fej0xfo,t1_fehalnj,1579152963.0,"Exactly, nail on the head.

But people forget the root issue.

Opiate metabolites activate the immune system causing a build of pain inducing inflammation chemicals called pro inflammatory cytokines. You don't feel this because other metabolites create the pain killing high we all know and love.

But the pain killing high has a half life of 12 hours whilst the inflammation chemicals have a half life of 12 days.

When you run out of opiates the sickness you feel is the built up inflammatory chemicals. That's why the worst of withdrawals take 6 plus days to get through. (doubleband triple those numbers it for opiods which are synthetic opiates) 

Your literally in pain as they destroy tissue, lay waste to serotonin, GABA and dopamine receptors, cause your bowls to open and your guts to expel. 

That's why it's so hard to stop. It's not a lack of will. It's just sheer fucking pain.

So people quitting your not a loser because you use again whilst in ""withdrawals"".
