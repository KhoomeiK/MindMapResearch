TV back in the day was like watching through an eighth inch of dust, and a zillion fuzzy lines and speckles. It's just staggering how far video quality has come. Even when things don't load that well, it's often better than what it used to look like. A random old CRT with rabbit ears--heck, even an outdoor antenna (had both in my house)--wouldn't give you the reception to notice little bitty details like that most of the time. Amazing."

Make two of me, offer me opportinities. I consider myself a person that tries to be decently helpful and nice overall, but there's little chance that if the choices are about me that I wouldn't seek my own best interest. The best interest for me will be for both me's sometimes, occasionally just one. Split the workweek between the two of us? Sure, less tired that way. Get two jobs to increase income? Sure. Split up housework? Absolutely. Both of us sleep with my husband? ...Oof. Naturally I'd have to really think hard, because both are me, other me loves him too...but I'm pretty average in that I don't want to share my husband. Both of me are likely to be thinking that same question, unless a copy error is made.

Or what about cooking? There's not enough room in my kitchen for two cooks. I could help me occasionally, but I'd have to figure out a way to split it up so I'd both be happy....because I'm thinking the same basic thoughts at the same basic time. At the exact same time, the *exactly* same words? Potentially and even probably not, but extremely close. Set us beside each other and startle us? Going to be frightened in about the same way.

Same person, just occupying two different points of space. The original brain wouldn't control both, but the original and copy brain would be nearly exact in its responses and thoughts.

Now is when it gets tricky...

If I split up work and leisure, I will inevitably begin to experience different things. My own life is fairly unremarkable so it isn't as if I am going to differ too much, but what if I send one of me off to get a job and get one in a field I've never worked in? The me that does so will get life experiences I can't fully relate to. That me would begin to become a little foreign, if the differences become significant enough. Significant enough different life experiences over a long enough time could in theory ""create"" a new person. It happens on the individual level every day, we see people say ""I'm not the person I used to be."" 

So, unless copy errors are made...same person. But if the lives aren't pretty close, each new same person would have a good chance of becoming a new person.

The big remaining question would be ""which new person is legally the first one, and how does the law apply to the other?"""

The Golden goddesses at least respond to prayers, if in odd ways, and tend to leave more abundant and helpful relics. They and their Triforce have been the driving force behind the series and retained their deity, while Hylia...kind of helps? Sometimes?

The statistical likelihood of getting hit by a tornado is very small, but don't ignore warnings just because ""nothing has come of them"" in the past. Radar cannot see all the way to the ground, so if the radar indicates there's a good enough bit of rotation up where it CAN see, a warning can be issued just to be safe. Sometimes someone calls in a funnel cloud and that might get warned, even if it never ""touches down.""

digimon,ff4awmz,t1_ff3xwao,1579559358.0,"Appmon was probably too radical in a sense, because it scared off some vets from the start with the whole ""Digimon universe"" thing (although I argue that's unreasonable as most of the varying series have taken place in different universes).

People's faves *tend* to be Adventure, Tamers, V-Tamers, and World, where there's a lot of focus on having a partner, and often on going to another world. Going with the pre-Adventure chosen kids and giving a pretty straightforward title without anything to scare people off (because, let's face it, fandoms are overall picky--myself included) might work. Maybe even ""Digimon Adventure Beta,"" or ""Digimon Adventure 90"" (that's a random number, don't know when the pre-Adv group went, but we know Iori's father knew of Digimon back in the day, so there are a lot of tie ins possible.)

The ""farming"" aspect of Digimon as an anime probably wouldn't do well in th States, unfortunately, as there's still a weird Poke Vs Digi rivalry and that might be seen the wrong way...but it might do well in Japan. So an anime based on that might be cool, too.

The subsequent cartoons have a lot to live up to, but all us fans haven't helped much. I want more Adventure, sure, but...not a reboot. I'd much rather see something new, but I know I'm probably in the minority in not liking reboots. Otherwise, why would there be so many in the world?"

todayilearned,fej6pjf,t1_fej2kok,1579159151.0,"I mean, maybe they don't live in an urban area? Like the local rich people just built their kid a new house on a hill nearish town and it's freaking huge. The house nearby that would be considered their neighbors is just a normal everyday house. And that's not too uncommon a little farther south, where country music people made a city that was basically ""fields, fields, some water, a road, and a couple of nice subdivisions"" into ""a place to build your obnoxiously big house near water.""

I'm not saying they're not a liar, or that they are a liar, but poor or normal people's land being close to a rich person's (even millionaires) doesn't seem out of the question if it isn't a city or dense suburb."

SupermodelCats,fej28ws,t3_epcdb6,1579154217.0,"Cats are less work than dogs, but proper cat ownership is still some effort.

Cats are not birds, are not dogs, are not humans. They express happiness and upset in entirely different ways than any of those animals. Learning ""how to cat"" is helpful to making sure you and a prospective kitty will both be happy, since cat is unlikely to figure out totally ""how to human."" The *My Cat from Hell* tv series is actually a pretty good crash course for learning a few things, what you shouldn't do, what you should do, stuff of that sort.

Cats sleep a LOT, but they also have a super high prey drive and like having something to do, things to climb, and stuff they can scratch. Different cats prefer different toys so the activity part is something of a learning process.

Cats are called assholes and a lot of nasty things, but learn ""how to cat"" and you'll find they're pretty much just sleepy-yet-zoomy lovemuffins. Neglecting learning how to understand and communicate with the fuzzball usually leads to some kind of unpleasant conflict, be it big or small. *Do* expect some furniture to get scratched, though, unless you trim the claws (not declawing, which is inhumane) or buy the little rubber claw covers.

Now, not every person is *so bad* at owning a cat that the cat becomes problematic, but it's good to learn.

The good thing is, there's not that much to know. There's really more to learning about dogs than cats, but dogs are ""intuitive"" because humans literally bred them to be pleasing or do jobs for us, cats are kind of more close to being wild than domestic. (Don't let that worry you though, cats are normally suuuuuuuuper well behaved, often way more so than dogs.)

Cats bring lots of joy and are extremely loving. Adopting one helps give a home to someone that may otherwise be put down! 

As daunting as all this text might seem, cats are honestly super easy. If you've never had one there is a learning curve, but it isn't big at *all.*"

I can lay on mine a while without discomfort, but eventually I'll want to roll. A hug is really just gentle pressure. But even a bearhug type sitch is fine, no pain. It'll come down to individual-human-liking-or-disliking-hugs more than anything. Some people might have, occasionally, extra sensitive boobs  OR boobs that are extra sensitive and might hurt because of PMS or nursing. 

Getting hit, elbowed, etc, that hurts though.

Pressure on boobs is like...pressure on the underside of your arm, or your tush. It's a bag of fat with a little bit of other tissue."

Decent amount goes on the floor, decent amount trickles along the underside of the urinal. I'd say most of it does go where it is supposed to, but a little bit going awry goes a long way when multiple people are using it.

Women's pee goes all over the seat, a little in front of the toilet, a little trickling down the front of the toilet, and all under the seat. (Sitting helps, people should sit more, but it still ends up in a lot of spots even when they do.)"
