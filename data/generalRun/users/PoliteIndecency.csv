hockey,ffd6imj,t1_ffcf3id,1579814379.0,"The reason I don't have a problem with high scoring in basketball is because once the ball is released there's nothing, aside from a block, a team can do to stop it. The high scores come from good exciting basketball because they're working hard to get those shots. Having said that I hate free throws. Give me an 85 - 84 with field goals and I'm happy.

With hockey, it's not the score that matters, it's the scoring chances. The goaltender makes the difference. A save is just as exciting as a goal (sometimes even for the fans of the team that got robbed). And watching those low-scoring high octane games where the goalies are on fire is one of the best things to watch in sports.

You want to increase scoring? Make the net 8 feet wide and bring back equipment from the 80s. I guarantee the game will be exponentially worse even with the higher scores. It's the journey, not the destination. And that applies to scoring a goal."

The big issue with the financial crisis wasn't necessarily that they were tied into real estate. If they'd held onto their properties during that time then the value is WAY above what it was post-recession. The problem during the crisis is that people were severely loading themselves with debt.
