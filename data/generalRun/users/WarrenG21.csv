AskReddit,ffk54vv,t1_ffk538k,1580016178.0,It’s simply a fact.
AskReddit,ffk52vp,t1_ffk4rq7,1580016125.0,What’s funny is I have a happy marriage.  Im assuming you’re probably single.
AskReddit,ffk4x9e,t1_ffk4ezp,1580015978.0,"I don’t think it is because it’s not a thing.  There are bad men and good men. There are good women and bad women. 

Men have emotions and women have emotions.  Women and men express emotions in similar and dissimilar ways.  That’s called life.

Are you silly enough to think men and women only act in certain ways explicitly?   That’s a pretty simplistic and narrow view.  

Of course, biology plays a role in generalities.  The male and female brain is different on a measurable level.  Are you denying science?  I’m assuming you consider yourself of the party of science, or no?"
AskReddit,ffk4ofb,t1_ffk4ebl,1580015749.0,"Haha ok.  Went to college. Met a lot of women. Some were feminists. 

Friends with a lot of women. Some consider themselves feminists. 

Dated lots of women. 

Am married. 

Have a mother (hurrr duuurrr). 

Sister. 

6 aunts. 

13 female first cousins. 

But sure, don’t know any women."
AskReddit,ffk47lr,t1_ffk32w4,1580015317.0,"Toxic masculinity is just a term made up by feminists because they are anti male.  Which is I’m saying.

AskReddit,ffk425z,t1_ffjc5o8,1580015178.0,"Ok, so what are we supposed to do as a society?  

Men do stay home and aren’t the breadwinners.  Men do have long boar.  Some men dress as women. Some are some do it for fun. 

So what’s your point?"
AskReddit,ffj7t12,t1_ffj6k49,1579992532.0,"But it’s a fact of life that women tend to stay at home with the child more then men because they are the primary caregivers.  That’s just biology, that can’t be changed. 

So your argument sounds like you want to push the deconstruction of social norms, which is impossible because they are rooted in biology.  

That being said, there’s nothing holding women back from advancing their career, having kids or not is there?  As far as I know there are no positions in public office or in the private sphere that women do not hold right?

So my point is, there’s nothing to do, it comes down to personal choice now, since under the law everyone is treated equally.   Further, women will always disproportionately be homemakers strictly because of biology, which is soemthing that’s not up for debate.  Men cannot give birth and cannot breastfeed."
AskReddit,ffj3rhg,t1_ffj37b6,1579989640.0,"Well more than 60 years ago, for instance the women’s suffrage movement.  There were literal laws that discriminated people based on sex. 

Everyone is equal now under the eyes of the law.  

So what issues exactly are you proposing women have that need to be addressed and how do we address them?  It’s a naive view to think every injustice in the world can be righted."
AskReddit,ffj2oyn,t1_ffj24d7,1579988881.0,"That’s not what it’s definition is though.  It’s female focused. 

Break down the word even.  It’s root is female. It’s a movement to focus on women’s issues, it hasn’t been about equality of the sexes for 60 years. The sexes are treated equal in the eyes of every law in the country, so the movement has no point anymore."

Equality has been reached.  Sure, the constitution wasn’t being correctly applied back then, but it is now. 

You might make a case for how men are at a disadvantage in both civil and criminal courts, but that isn’t a topic feminists are fighting for.  If you think they are you’re being dishonest.

So how exactly would you implement the “biometric” measures.  Is the government going to pay for every gun owner to have a massive safe that they are obligated to keep their guns in?   You think that will prevent suicide by gun? That’s pretty laughable unless you are going to restrict someone’s guns indefinitely because someone made a phone call about them.  

You think criminals will lock up their guns as told by the government?  The mentally ill?  I mean that policy is laughable.  I’m telling you right now I would never allow the government to control my guns.  That goes for the majority of gun owners, because we actually understand our rights and what they are for."

1. He said that many ILLEGAL immigrants are rapists and murderers. Which is objectively true.  Something like 80% of women are sexually assaulted when traveling here to illegally cross border.  

He also always states that we must have a clear path to citizenship, but they have to do it legally. 

2. He said there were “good people on both sides” of the Charlottesville rally.  Which there objectively were, not everyone on the right side of the isle was a nazi.  He also said “to be clear, white nationalism and nazism should be condemned totally” in the same speech.
3. Would need to look more into Miller but my guess is it’s overhyped based on the rest of what he stated. 
4.  The “Muslim” ban was a halt on travel from countries that the Obama administration flagged, not trump.


It’s just sensationalized nonsense. Don’t believe anyone before you look deep into it.  People can abstract quotes from people easily.  Listen to it straight from their mouth.

Edit: in regard to miller. A quick google search shows that the evidence against him comes from the southern poverty law center, so that’s all I need to know.

Should ask yourself, isn’t it strange that the first arguments they have to make are so easily debunked?   Should make you seriously think.  

Just as it should make you wonder why he was impeached, when so many dems ran on impeachment in the midterms before the Ukraine stuff happened.  How did they know he was going to commit an impeachable offense before it that all happpened?  Why was impeachment literally split down party lines?

And again, you’re being naive and short sighted.  Yea, right now I’m not afraid that our government would abuse the second amendment, even if they had the ability to.   But what about in 30 years, 100 years, 500?   Do you only care about this country while you’re alive? Or do you care about future generations.  It’s a terrible thing to want to dismantle something you obviously haven’t understood it’s purpose for yet.   If you don’t think it’s possible that handing a power like that over to the government couldn’t one day be used to harm the populace than you’re being dishonest at this point.

news,ff456ia,t1_ff41ho0,1579555783.0,"I don’t think you are understanding how the punctuation works in the second amendment.   It is not saying the right to bear arms is contingent on being in a militia.  The right is extended to the individual.  And that individuals are also protected under the amendment to form a militia. There are plenty of writings by the founders you can read that explain that the right to bear arms is an individual right. 

Your second solution here is much more sensible since it does not blatantly violate the second amendment, rather just qualifies it with a few extra steps.  Although 3 years would be too frequent in my opinion, I’d be fine with people needing to pass some kind of a gun safety course and maybe a one time interview with a psychiatrist.  I mean I’ve basically been through that as it’s required in my state to obtain a cpl. 

But I don’t believe that will reduce gun deaths significantly.  It will reduce accidental gun deaths, but not intentional ones.  Which, by the way, I think is borderline impossible to do without eradicating the second amendment."

And again,  like I said, assault rifles account for barely a fraction of gun deaths in this country.  Why are we focusing on that so much?  They are not the guns used to murder people.  Don’t you want to focus policy on guns that account for the majority of gun deaths?  Shouldn’t we be focused on hand guns?   Or am I going to get more crickets from you on that fact?

That’s the problem, the news has sensationalized this topic and you don’t even know what the facts are. 

Also, the ar-15 is a great gun for hunting pests.  Farmers choose those above others when dealing with nuisance animals like coyotes, boar, wolves, etc.   so to call it useless is showing your lack of knowledge here as well. 

Edit: My solution? I believe we need to educate our population on how to safely handle and store firearms in our public school system.  Otherwise, leave the country if you don’t like the second amendment, it is not to be infringed by the government or any individual.

The overwhelming majority of gun deaths are by suicide.  

The weapon of choice for shootings is hand guns, not rifles.  So why the focus on rifles?

Cue the crickets from the left.....


Edit: and creating something that allows the government to control your use of guns by having access to your safe is obviously a direct violation of the second amendment so that’s one of the dumbest proposals I’ve ever heard."
