Chargers,fdn1264,t1_fdmjswo,1578573998.0,"True. It does not help that we finished 4th in West this year. But a man can dream about having a new QB that could be our QB for another 20 years. Also worth noting, with Phil only 3/5 wins this year were by more than 1 score. Could easily see those two close games as losses without Phil. That could put us at 3-13."
Chargers,fdn0ymc,t1_fdmlsc2,1578573903.0,"I don’t plan on anything. I’m just a selfish fan watching college football and dreaming about the future. But if the Chargers did lose practically every game in 2020, I wouldn’t be upset."
Chargers,fdmes1d,t1_fdmbsj8,1578547517.0,I dunno. A Tyrod QB’d team looks like a solid contender. Add in losing Melvin and a few bad injuries and you got a Lawrence stew brewing.
Chargers,fdkxzk6,t3_elhmii,1578513474.0,I am sure I will get downvoted to oblivion for this but my secret dream is to be in a position to get Trevor Lawrence in 2021. To do that we should push for securing our O-Line
CatastrophicFailure,fdkktjj,t1_fdjsul9,1578505650.0,"I have heard that IATA protocols dictate that the investigation must be done by the country in which the crash occurred. If that is the case they would just be following protocol as Iran must do the investigation and due to that are not permitted to hand over the black box at this stage.

But that is just what someone else said on another thread."

NetflixCanada,fcxl0hm,t1_fcxkeku,1578065496.0,"Ya RCA isn’t listed on their website. As much as I may like one brand that is a big reason I try and diversify my boxes. You never know when one may not have support from a new streaming service. 

What about Xbox or PlayStation? They both have prime support."
NetflixCanada,fcxhi2r,t1_fcwp7sy,1578063057.0,"You have a hard time getting prime? I figured all Smart TVs had an app for it. I have LGs and they all have it. As well as any tv box I have ever had or seen others have included it as well. 

Looks like on their website most manufacturers include it.

progun,fcnf1an,t1_fcne6iw,1577810386.0,I am glad you see someone repurposing your own thoughts as stupidity. There is hope for you yet.
progun,fcnds9v,t1_fcndil2,1577809589.0,"Maybe when pro gun losers shoot back they are all just part of a gang too. In that event all mass shootings can be eliminated statistically and turned to gang violence. That would be the only way a pro gun group could stop mass shootings. 

The WASP Terrorist gang and Pro Gun gangs could eliminate mass shootings alone."
progun,fcncmaq,t1_fcnaftf,1577808822.0,"How is a list of events tied to a definition of mass shootings not evidence? Do you know what evidence means? 

Mother Jones' definition is 3 or more people killed. Here I did your job for you, the following incidents are not included on the Mother Jones list for some reason:

These 20 incidents happened in just the last quarter of the year...

""But...but professorsillyputty a triple homicide suicide isn't a mass murder..."" listen here mother fucker, you made the Mother Jones definition accurate quit moving the goal posts ya dumb cunt.

FACT - over 400 incidents happened in 2019 that injured + killed 3+ people

Feel free to argue that those incidents don't matter because in most of them a lot of people didn't die. You'll still be a dumb cunt to argue that but dumb cunts will be dumb cunts some times.

Who hurt you when you were a child to make you so angry about this?"
progun,fcn9yzo,t1_fcn8s93,1577807031.0,Other lists have included that? That’s pretty silly. I will be honest and have not dig deeply into the wiki list but it looked like that list only included numbers of people that were shot right?
progun,fcn9r55,t1_fcn5qn8,1577806878.0,"I wouldn’t get your panties in too much of a bunch. All I did was provide you with the list and evidence you asked for. 

So you prefer the Mother Jones definition for mass shooting? Not sure if that one makes sense but just for fun why don’t you go and cross reference the Wikipedia list with the one you provided. There are tons that meet the MJ definition that are still not included for some reason (a quick count had 65 with 3 or more deaths, even if those included the shooter There were not 55/65 with 3 listed). Under the MJ criteria you could literally have someone shoot and injure 1000s of people and it would not constitute a mass shooting, think about that. 

The definition the wiki article uses is 4 or more people SHOT. For a definition of mass SHOOTING that seems to be pretty fair. It seems you are arguing mass MURDERS. Which is obviously not at over 400. But I am not too sure why you are so upset about this as no one said there were over 400 gun related mass murders. 

But you cannot deny that a group of four or more(a mass of people) were not involved in more than  400 shootings in the US."

todayilearned,fcgpgs2,t1_fcgiwu6,1577642702.0,you were unable to string words together to explain yourself and were also quite the cunt. but don't worry about self reflection. I am sorry i did not consider you would be an egocentric east coaster that doesn't understand what football programs are called or the difference between evening and night.
todayilearned,fccdccs,t1_fccbz87,1577597102.0,"In my defense. In my time zone the afternoon games end at 5:00 making it not even worth considering and the (at the time) ESPN Sunday Night Football was often rehosted in Canada and could have been rehosted on Global which hosted Fox shows or CTV, who knows which one it was 20 years ago. 

Thanks for responding with actual reasoning and well worded responses though."
todayilearned,fcc9q8b,t1_fcc0ium,1577595947.0,"That is a good thing I had not considered. Thank you, my mistake."
todayilearned,fcbyfgk,t1_fcbxw8s,1577592360.0,That’s evening. I know it is semantics. But when the thread is referencing Sunday night and there is a program called Sunday night football you have to be a real dumb cunt to not think to correlate the two.
