explainlikeimfive,fflq5xh,t3_eu1ju5,1580042698.0,"One unmentioned point, security works best when as many combinations as possible can be ACCEPTED but only one will unlock. Various locks exist for devices often behind other secure systems as a secondary defense, and even the most amateur lock picker can usually bypass them in minutes, some without tools, because they’re built to accept only one key - the correct one. Lock picking is always a brute force process because there’s no way to solve a secure lock.

Those locks are often touted for being bump proof which isn’t wrong but it doesn’t matter if solving it is a possibility.

Safes are crackle for the same reason, you can solve the combination. In computing, it’s ridiculously easy in theory to break encryption because it’s solvable, so the solution is simply to make the solve take trillions of billions of years."

I think the worst thing to happen in recent years is the idea that different cultures is a problem. Sure, using it against someone is a problem, but it’s to be celebrated not suppressed for political correctness.

Reignbot is a damn fine horror channel who does it for passion not views so she’s highly inconsistent but quality. Peter Brown, not sure if he’s trying to make a career out of it given how solid his production quality is, but if you ever want to know anything about lathes or epoxy, he’s the man to follow.

personalfinance,ffjpkux,t1_ffjpckd,1580003751.0,"I understand his confusion, a LOT of places say “you must be 25 at the end of the year” but that’s poor English as “the” is undefined. The IRS does word it better by stating “were you” so you know it’s at least unlikely to be this year:

personalfinance,ffjp6cx,t3_eu08qi,1580003473.0,You file your taxes the following year so you have all of the data for the previous year. You must have been at least 25 and younger than 65 on December 31st of the year you are filing for. You are correct.
worldpolitics,ffhxuxz,t1_ffhw0xi,1579958613.0,They’ve published fake documents in recent years but I don’t think anything terribly damning.

worldpolitics,ffhxp4j,t1_ffhvtia,1579958432.0,"It’s fun watching people argue their “constitutional rights”. It’s not designed to target the individual, it’s designed to target the government. How can a document whose job is to tell the government what it can and can’t do also be a document that gives you explicit rights?

The founding fathers clearly understood that the federal government has no place in the lives of the individual, that their job was to protect the individual from big government giving states and other smaller governments those responsibilities, because it’s a lot harder to control a nation when a law needs to be passed by thousands of lawmakers to be universal."

PersonalFinanceCanada,fffqxrz,t1_ffffghs,1579889871.0,"Unfortunately the government needs to be as unbiased as possible when possible, and we also run into an issue with the distinction of liquid vs non-liquid wealth - we can go after the liquid wealth billionaires but we wouldn’t get much from them, and many of them are well known philanthropist. We can go after the non-liquid wealthy but that has some pretty worrisome side effects for the lower and middle class. The few that do manage to retire with a couple million dollars (seems like a lot but for many these millions need to last 20-30 years, ends up not being much different than $40-80k salary) should be worried if we start treating all wealth equally and try to go after it. 

The reality is when you do the numbers, you can only bleed them dry for so long without having to keep dropping the limits, eventually you end up with the countries that have 40-60% income tax rates on top of low income averages. We considered moving to Canada for reasons unrelated to the state of the US government but I would’ve had to take a pay cut of about 80% after taxes. No thanks."
PersonalFinanceCanada,ffff43d,t1_fffez0e,1579882593.0,"Obviously, Bezos likely wouldn’t be notably impacted by Canada’s tax policy.

The point is in general, such taxes don’t have the effect most people think and most politicians claim they will."
PersonalFinanceCanada,ffet29i,t1_ffd4ty0,1579864196.0,"There’s also distinctions among what constitutes wealth, and how that wealth is used. For example, bezos allegedly has a yearly income of around $80k. Sure, everything he owns is paid for, so $80k is a lot of money to someone who owes nobody, but if Amazon disappeared tomorrow, he’d be low in the “millionaires” club. If all of his investments vanished, he’d probably be in the low 6 figure range. 

That’s different than wealthy people like Warren Buffet who could loose all of his investments and still likely be a billionaire, and he had no plans to ever spend his cash, and Bill Gates who also has a lot of liquidity, but likely not a lot of liquid assets at any given time given how much he spends on philanthropy.

And the problem is, most “tax the rich” policies will go after the Bezos’, but not the Buffets or Gates."

Libertarian,ffcgmhh,t1_ffcfivh,1579799031.0,"What would you say is healthcare, the actual health services or the process of paying for them because if the former that’s simply not true. Insurance companies promised more clients to hospitals in exchange for discounts to their members, and it went out of control from there. Not only do those services operate exactly the same, many hospitals are moving to push insurance companies out as they find people are more willing to actually pay their bill if they bill out of pocket at a fair rate. 

On top of that, insurance companies have sued multiple doctors for “illegally practicing insurance” for offering subscription plans - $20 a month and you pay about as much as other countries do for the same services.

It doesn’t matter who runs the insurance company the concept is still the same - take money from subscribers, put it into an investment fund, pocket portions of that money and the investment gains, give subscribers automatic discounts that no surprise - most people can access if they just ask, but few do - and still expect out of pocket expenses to cover the remaining costs.

We had a baby without insurance, $300 out of pocket. We had one with insurance, $5,000 out of pocket, plus monthly premiums. That’s just one example too - sure the hospital sent us a $12,000 bill but in the end they asked for $300 to call it even - and we weren’t even qualified for their low income programs that would’ve forgiven the $300.

So yeah, just because that’s “how things work” doesn’t mean you have to be complacent. An entire country was founded on the idea of being fed up with “how things work.”

Maybe I do want a massive change, free market healthcare where doctors who provide a service are the only ones making a profit off those services, and don’t rely on government or third party involvement to avoid bankruptcy in the process.

Inb4 the argument of technological advancements - most of those occur at university funded teaching hospitals, your standard hospital is just a consumer of those advancements, paying insurance companies won’t make healthcare better just more expensive, period."

AskReddit,ffbu68e,t3_ess9yr,1579782857.0,"To the anti-gun people out there, you should understand that there’s currently a bill to make cellphones illegal for people under 21. Most people just laugh or get pissy calling it ridiculous political theater. It is ridiculous political theatre, but for a very important cause. Cellphones lead to more deaths in a single year among people under 21 than guns have in over 10 years, even with the recent increases in school shootings. Additionally, states that have more liberal gun policy have VERY low gun crime rates involving mass shooting attempts and unknown attacker/victim attempts. The only gun crime that’s generally unaffected by gun laws, including bans, is known attacker/victim crimes. For those cases that are affected, they usually just move to using knives (you may hear about the UKs knife problem - it’s not NEARLY as bad as gun nuts claim but the fact knife crime did go up is true)

Additionally, there is no such thing as a gun free country. Australia actually has more free access to guns in many ways compared to the US, and Japan still has plenty of gun crime considering the insanely specific laws around gun ownership there (can’t keep ammo and gun in same place, must be kept locked at all times unless you’re at a gun range, need to undergo months of training before you can even get a permit, then you need a permit for the specific gun you wish to buy, etc)

Those countries do a great job of keeping most of their guns in the hands of good guys, but they also don’t guarantee their citizens any freedoms. For example, in Japan, most court cases end with a guilty verdict and there’s no such thing as accidentally breaking a law there. You’ve probably heard of people in China killing people they accidentally hit with a car - and it’s because China doesn’t like caring for the sick or disabled so it’s a higher crime to hit and injure someone than it is to hit and kill someone - that kind of logic is more common outside of “gun loving USA”

To many, it’s not the gun they seek rights for, but the freedom the constitution promises us. It doesn’t matter how much you love your government, give them an inch and they’ll take a mile. No matter what system you have, that has never not been the case historically."
