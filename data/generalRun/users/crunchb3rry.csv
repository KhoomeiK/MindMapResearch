Never noticed any bugs. But they put a lot of time into updates and even document a lot of the development on Steam, more so than any dev I've ever seen."
gaming,ff6p58h,t1_ff6mllr,1579631957.0,Factorio would consume your soul. That game is amazing when you consider the point is to make it eventually play itself. When you feel like you need to go to college just to get really good at it.

I would only do that again if I had a dream setup of two beefy computers at my desk. One strictly for gaming and one for everything else.

But that's all related to resources. Boot times don't bother me. If anything they indicate when it might be time to buy a new mobo and start a new build. But they have to be really long for that to give me the itch."
