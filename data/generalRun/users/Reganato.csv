There's so much fucking porn out there, and people just don't give that much of a shit and don't look into it.  Should he have an enemy someday it might become a minor pain, but I honestly don't see it being something that's going to disqualify him from jobs or anything like that.  

I really wouldn't worry about it, and I'd stay off his channel if that isn't the kind of thing you'd like to see."

relationship_advice,ffgq5ri,t3_etj1ym,1579912234.0,"I hate that you're going through this.  I've heard similar, and it breaks my heart.  I love my kid, and can't imagine behaving in the way he is, but I know many men do and you're making the right choice.

As for what you do, you're not going to get quality advice here.  Seriously.  Just get off the sub.  If you want someone to just listen, I'm completely willing to do that.  We can set up a chat, email, whatever, but for advice you need a lawyer and a therapist.  This is beyond the depth and knowledge of this sub.  

Take care of yourself, and take care of those kids."

relationship_advice,ffgplu4,t3_etj45v,1579911844.0,"This feels carefully constructed to make it sound as unbiased as possible.  Which almost makes me suspicious ... But I'm going to just take it all at face value.

Yes, she's blowing this out of proportion.  Your parents have never met her parents.  As far as I'm aware they don't have a whole lot of special significance to them right now, nor do I feel they should.  All subjective, but you've only been together a bit over two years.  That's not nothing, but it also isn't that long.  

I think the most important thing is holding you responsible for something you can't really be held responsible for.  

I would ask her what she believes you should have done and I'd try to coax out what's really bothering her.  Just listen and ask questions.  Something is up, and this isn't really about your parents.  She could maybe be a little frustrated with them if she wanted, but that feels a little unreasonable.  Being really angry at you is completely unreasonable.

So, be calm, get her talking and listen.  Just keep asking ""and what else?""  Let her talk long enough and the real problem will come out."
sex,ffgieqf,t3_eti3m9,1579906943.0,"I mean, you can angle at this all you want, but did you mention that you've been interested in that?  Because that was the time to have that conversation.  If she were interested, she'd let you know then.  

Still, the most direct approach now is still to just talk to her again and just be up front.  Say you've always wanted to try and and ask if she's interested.  If you're both single and open, it really doesn't have to be awkward.  She can just say no."

sex,ffgdlj2,t3_etghne,1579903877.0,"You don't sound selfish at all, and if she took it that way I would be very, very concerned about her having that perspective.

I understand not wanting to have to ask though.  That's hard, but you can't negotiate desire.  All you can ask for are specific things.  If you're concerned that she doesn't enjoy them, that she isn't concerned with your pleasure and isn't motivated to please you as well ... I mean yeah, that's a thing to be concerned about.  

So, ask.  Bring it up.  Don't let it boil over and get angry, just be direct and honest and tell her that you'd like her to help.  I don't know where that conversation goes, but you should start it.  And you should start it knowing that it's okay to ask, and that you're not being selfish, and that you should resist notions to the contrary."
AskMen,ffgd2zh,t3_ethdgp,1579903554.0,"Rings can usually, almost always be sized up and down.  Probably better if you get it right, and honestly I think it might be best if you just find out or get close somehow.  Take a ring she owns, just ask, something.  Surprises are nice but I'm not ... somebody else has to correct me if I'm wrong, but I think asking someone to marry you is probably something which really shouldn't come completely out of left field so I wouldn't be obsessive about not tipping your hand."
relationship_advice,ffgbwut,t1_ffgb2s9,1579902836.0,"Still sounding a little dramatic for my taste, but yeah, that's the idea.  You should probably take a hard look at your marriage.  People naturally develop crushes.  They also develop them to fill voids in their relationships.  With you I'm betting the latter.  I think you should be thinking about what's missing and wrong there."
relationship_advice,ffgachw,t1_ffg96vl,1579901881.0,"Stop calling yourself the devil.  Just stay away from her.  You developed a crush.  It's natural and normal.  Reddit is really good at trying to crucify people for fairly insignificant shit because it's full of inexperienced kids.  Don't internalize their shity ideas.  You got close to someone, then developed feelings.  It happens.  It's normal.  It's fine.  Now you recognize those feelings and now you have to decide what to do with them and the best thing to do is to stop feeding them by staying away and redirecting your focus towards your own marriage.  That's all.  Nothing really happened here.  Just normal relationship maintenance shit that you didn't know how to deal with probably because some shit head or shit heads, like many of the redditors here, taught you to be ashamed of half the things you've ever felt.  It's fine.  You walked up to the line but didn't cross it.  Just pull it together now that you know what to do."
