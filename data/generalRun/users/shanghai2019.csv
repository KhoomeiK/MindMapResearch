depression,fevgt8i,t3_eqelf5,1579397230.0,"So sorry. That’s horrific. Trauma is the fucking worst. Idk if you’ve done/are doing therapy, but I found a lot of help in trauma-centered therapy (EMDR in my case). Helped with my PTSD, more than my regular therapy did (even though that was also helpful)."

52book,fe4w4fc,t1_fe4jqzs,1578863346.0,Killers of the Flower Moon keeps popping up on my Audible recommendations. I’ll have to go read up on it.
52book,fe4vnfo,t3_enn4ig,1578863190.0,"This week I finished **Know My Name** by Chanel Miller. Devoured it really. 3/52.  

I started **The Fellowship of the Rings** today. Somehow in my 27 years I’ve never read any of the LOTR books? Going to read the series this year. 

Anyone have recommendations for shorter books- less than 10 hours or so audio or less than ~250 pages? Either fiction or nonfiction. I’ve got about 25 books on my reading list, but they’re all on the long-side. Trying to balance out some of that so I keep making progress and stay motivated."
depression,fdgb89p,t3_el54zx,1578388238.0,"With the combination of meds I’m on, I can’t even read book these days. My brain can’t focus for more than three or four pages. Thankfully audiobooks tend to be ok if I break it up in smaller pieces. 

I was in a meeting today and my boss asked if I had any questions or concerns, and I just sat there, like...imma need three business days to get back to you on that."

depression,fcqjky7,t3_eigaut,1577887147.0,"There’s a collection of poems I love by Jane Kenyon called “Having It Out With Melancholy.” One of them is about her dog... 

“The dog searches until he finds me 
upstairs, lies down with a clatter 
of elbows, puts his head on my foot.

Sometimes the sound of his breathing 
saves my life—in and out, in 
and out; a pause, a long sigh. . . .”

My dog saved my life too. It was so hard when she died. I’m so sorry for you."
