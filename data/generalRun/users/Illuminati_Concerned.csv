Something I'd like to caution you about, since you're just starting out in your dating life, is about the concept of not setting yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. while all relationships require some level of compromise, be cautious of unfairly stretching yourself to compensate for something that a partner either can't or won't provide in a relationship. not every relationship works out, and that's ok - honestly, that's the biggest piece of advice i would give ANYONE about dating, that it's absolutely ok to leave a relationship that isn't fulfilling you. it's actually pretty hard to find someone that you're genuinely compatible with over a long term, and not having your first (or 15th, or 27th!) relationship end in Happily Ever After doesn't make you a failure, or unworthy of a healthy relationship. it honestly sounds to me like he isn't in a place mentally/emotionally right now to be able to be a good partner, and you are bending over backwards to pick up that slack, which may seem noble and romantic, but is neither fair to you nor sustainable over the long term. i wish you both the best of luck!!"
