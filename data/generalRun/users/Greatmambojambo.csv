funny,ffwdqdj,t1_ffw23jp,1580296961.0,"I’ve been to 3 dentists so far. 2 in Florida, where I live and one in Texas. All of them brought up bleaching *repeatedly*. The one in Texas was especially weird. I chipped my tooth in a mountainbike accident and basically went in for emergency treatment. Pretty shabby clinic tbh, I eventually decided to just have him file my tooth and take care of it at my regular dentist in FL. The instruments he had looked like a relict from the 50s. Even that guy brought up his whitening specials to me for some reason. 

But it is entirely anecdotal, you’re right about that."
wholesomememes,ffw1uta,t1_ffvyar3,1580280772.0,You can’t go through life without making enemies. Even if you do your best to be nice to everyone someone will hate you for being a suck up.
funny,ffw1lsc,t1_ffw10km,1580280495.0,"A bit unrelated but I lived in Europe for over 2 decades. Dentists always told me I had fantastic teeth (I do take care of them & floss daily) and that I should be glad. Friends & family always told me that I should be happy that I “inherited” the teeth of my grandmother, who had very healthy teeth right up to her death at 91 y/o. First time I went to a dentist in the US they told me that they are a bit on the yellow side and asked me if I had considered bleaching them. Not even sure it’s dentists who do that in Europe and I was kind of weirded out. So was the dentists when I told him I’m perfectly happy with my teeth. Kind of an obsession in the US, if you ask me."
wholesomememes,ffuisay,t1_ffubbzd,1580242838.0,"I kind of disagree and think the analogy used to describe this situation actually showcases why it’s sometimes outright necessary to explain that things could be worse. It’s true that you’re equally dead whether you drown 2 feet under water or 10 feet underwater, but it’s a lot easier to swim up 2 feet than it is to swim up 10 feet. You’re drowning in both scenarios, suffering is suffering, that’s where that analogy perfectly works, but it’s a lot easier to turn the former situation around. There’s a lot of value in realizing that. Hearing from others who arguably have it worse *can* be beneficial. It’s important to not belittle the other person, though. “Pff that’s nothing, I had it so much worse” obviously is a dick move. But saying something along the lines of “This isn’t a competition, if you suffer you suffer, but I was at a point where yadda yadda yadda and you still can/could yadda yadda yadda” is a completely different story. Empathy is empathy, just as suffering is suffering. Not accepting that and being offended by it just means you’re looking for pitty, and that’s pretty much the same thing as people who always had it “much worse” are doing.

Edit: This part of the comment pretty much just exists to spite u/RussianSans. Do with that information what you want. 

I’ll concede this, though: If someone comes to you and tells you how shit their day was, how annoying their boss is, that their wife/husband never does what they want, that they think their pet turtles are intentionally shitting in their socks or whatever it is they complain about, you get a tub of ice cream, open a bottle of chardonay or whatever the fuck it is you use as soul food and you *listen*. No one wants to hear about more effective time management, conflict resolution tactics or the technological miracle of closed doors in that scenarion. But if you feel like someone genuinely *suffers*, sharing your experience can help."

WatchDogsWoofInside,fftsyub,t3_ev6mp7,1580228220.0,"Alright, I’ll be the buzz killing party pooper, Obesity, especially in retrievers, isn’t something that we should adore, find cute or aspire to make them look like. A lot of dogs are too heavy already, many people consider healthy dogs too thin (This, again, is especially true for retrievers). They’re both overfed and very prone to hip dysplasia. This will lead to a lot of pain for the dog. And cost the owner a lot of money. It also raises the cancer risk. Most dog owners neuter their dogs because it lowers the risk of certain types of cancer, but this is also true for overweight. Don’t normalize dog obesity, it’s a pain in the ass for the poor souls."
