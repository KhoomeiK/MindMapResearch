democrats,feombya,t1_feolbs3,1579302075.0,That's how compulsory voting works in Australia. You get your name ticked off the roll to indicate you've shown up to the polling booth.
democrats,feom8s2,t1_feojrcf,1579302023.0,Show up to the voting booth and cast a blank ballot. It makes not voting even more of a statement than being too lazy to leave the house or cast an absentee ballot.

In the meantime don't let your money sit around doing nothing, be proactive and invest that money so that you can at least make 6-7% pa returns.

Futurology,fecxmls,t1_fecdb8q,1578988762.0,"GMO labelling is idiotic because it doesn't mean anything and only serves to fuel alarmist rhetoric. If you labelled all domesticated cultivars Artificially Selected Organisms (ASOs) which they are, there are enough morons who will make alarmist rhetoric about that even though the label doesn't mean anything. GMOs are tested to be safe and are better for the environment and actually contain fewer carcinogens because they don't rely on pesticides."

Not only is it a completely inept organisation incapable of producing products that people will actually buy, it's also been one of the biggest driving forces behind the smothering of public transit in the US. GM at the end of the day is really a thinly veiled jobs program, not an actual company that deserves to thrive."
