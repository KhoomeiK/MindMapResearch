I feel like there should also be some sort of philanthropy law put in place for the ridiculously rich.  They are rich off of the masses beneath them.  I doubt very many made their money without the lower and middle classes helping them along the way.  They should be paying back the community through a specified list of philanthropic projects.

worldnews,fe80wm1,t1_fe7vvla,1578921127.0,"Trump did this unilaterally.  He told Fox News, McConnell, and his buddies at Mar-a-Lago more about it than he did Congress or his military advisers or our allies.  He did it blatantly, and admittedly, to sway voters in the Senate when it comes time for the hearings on whether he should be removed for his impeachment.  He killed him when Soleimani was on his way to peace talks.  This was basically akin to them killing the vice president of the US, he could have easily started a war.  He had one of our bases attacked by missiles in retaliation, then a civilian flight of 167 people was shot down and all of them killed, besides those lives ruined by losing loved ones in the plane being shot down, hundreds of other families had their New Years ruined with a less than 24 hour call to deploy, Iraq is looking to make our troops withdraw, our allies trust us even less now... all over this assassination he pulled for all the wrong reasons.  And now they are all, on both sides, lying and twisting things to try to justify what they did.  That's why it was a bad thing.

Edit:  Lots of downvotes, not a lot of proof he did otherwise."

TL;DR - He made disparaging comments about Mexican immigrants (surprise, surprise... might be why he goes after them so much, too) so NBC cut ties with him in June of 2015 and cancelled the airing of the Miss Universe pageant. Not long after they also announced he wouldn't be back as the host of Celebrity Apprentice the next season and would be replaced."
