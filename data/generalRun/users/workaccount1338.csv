worldnews,fdeds33,t1_fdeda1u,1578336822.0,">That is a very, very stupid business model. If insurance companies had to pay out on 100% of the deals they give, they wouldnt post any profits at all.

So let's give a micro example that may help you relate to the macro here, I am genuinely trying to be helpful but if you still don't get it you are dense as fuck, please try to read along.

Example: You are a Homeowner with 2 cars, a Home, and a motorcycle. You pay $5,000  avg a year for coverage, and experience 0 claims until a claim in your 10th year, damages totaling $50,000. 

Under your math, the Insurance Company posts a $0 profit, right? Wrong. The Insurance Company is making investments with premium....this is the main profit driver behind the Insurance Industry. It's the exact same concept as a bank loan, just reverse order."
worldnews,fdecpgu,t1_fdeae1r,1578336150.0,"> Insurance companies work on the idea that they only make money if people dont use the service they are paying for.

Again, you did not read my comment. Most P&C carriers (see: not health) post minimal, if any, underwriting profits. The industry as a whole *pays out more in claims than it receives in premium*. The reason why this is able to work is because of *float*. You pay the Carrier monthly/yearly/whatever for coverage, but do not need it right away. They make investments with that premium aka *float* and this is the profit driver for Insurance."
