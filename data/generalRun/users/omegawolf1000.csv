But since it is just increasing stroke I'm betting the redline will drop unless they use stronger and lighter internals. It would be better suited to forced induction. A 7k+ redline is a wonderful thing, hopefully that stays. 

The current car is one of the best to thrash around a track beating the heck out of it. The best part is the car operates the best when being completely on edge, it is kind of a masochist. On the street nothing works as well. The sensation of rotating the car for some slip angle around a 100kph corner is what keeps me in it.

I hope the new car can capture what made this car great. Part of that is being naturally aspirated for me. I drove a new WRX and somehow it felt slower to me. The turbo lag dulled the immediacy and direct connection to the engine for me. Makes me nervous if the new car will have a turbo."

ft86,ff574eb,t1_ff38ric,1579582150.0,"$2000 and 2 days is a good start but still feels soft to me. Monetary punishments aren't effective on the high earning citizen. $2000 is just a slight slap for some people. I think it should be treated as a full on crime. Go to police station, see judge for sentencing, have to then do community service for some number of hours. It should be humiliating and you should be stuck explaining at every job interview why you have a criminal record for many years after. Same as drunk driving. It would also make it so if you're a non-national then you are deported and have to wait so many years for reentry due to the criminal record. A mandatory driving retraining course should also be necessary before these people are given a license again. Then there are no excuses about not knowing the law.

I argue that drunk driving and texting should be treated as such because they are clearly intentional acts. Speeding or making an illegal turn can be mistakes of ignorance due to not seeing a sign for example. These acts do not always necessarily cause endangerment to other people's lives. I feel the existing punishments are sufficient, although for all fines I'm in favour of them being based as a percentage of income plus a minimum amount.

While my proposal may seem harsh, the reality is people die due to the selfish and intentional acts of other drivers every year. These acts are entirely preventable. First through public education about the dangers of drunk and distracted driving. Failing this, despite having ample opportunity to be made aware of the law and the dangers associated with these acts the perpetrator of the aforementioned crimes must receive a sufficiently humiliating, and personally costly punishment to prevent repeat behaviour and to demonstrate the seriousness of these laws to others.

I drive a small car and ride a bicycle, so I'm anal about this stuff. I've been rear ended twice sitting at or coming to a stop for a red light by distracted drivers."

funny,fews72w,t1_fevyzox,1579418695.0,"Further north (Canada) it was night, full on blizzard, zero visibility and covered roads. The ditches were filled in, so couldn't even know the general location of the road. I just sat on the (presumed) side of the highway for someone to crawl by me and then I followed their tail lights to the small country town I was living in. The only thing I could see was their tail lights, the ground was pure white. They must have been living there for a long time because they probably just used their memory of where the highway was.

The general advisory from the government is to not travel during these conditions but white out blizzards can hit while you're at work. The days are short so you're usually driving to and from work in the dark. Nothing would get done if everyone stayed home everytime bad weather was possible during the winter. If you drive slowly the worse that happens is you slowly drive off the highway and get stuck. Usually no damage beyond a mud flap or something minor like that.

ft86,feozibi,t1_feomzv7,1579308778.0,"Realize that 13 and 14 were the highest selling years too, so even if the reliability was the same it would appear to have more issues as a model year. Also consider these are the most used and highest mileage ones. The newer models have had less opportunity both in quantity and temporally to develop issues. They are also the cheapest to buy and be thrashed on. There's a reason I always buy used from the first owner. When you're hit with the hard depreciation you treat your car better. The valve spring issues were mostly due to botched repair jobs instead of actual failures of the springs. Mine is on the recall list and I'm not doing it unless I can get free clutch labour out of it.

Plenty of very high mileage 13s and 14s out there. Compared with the rest of the industry the early models are pretty darn reliable. Also consider that cars like Corollas experience a much more relaxed driving style and use case than these cars."

> There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.

> It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.

> I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.

> Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.

> We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.""

> Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the "" Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.

> Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check"". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.""

> And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.

> Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. ""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.""

> I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.""

> For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, ""Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.""

> It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.

> For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.

funny,feg13ak,t1_feeij8g,1579072417.0,"I'm always split on cheap adoptions. As cruel as it sounds I agree that the monetary value of the animal is low. Simple supply and demand of animals needing homes, it's a sad situation for sure. On the other hand having a pet is expensive so $85 doesn't seem like much in comparison. If someone is truly invested in caring for the animal it shouldn't be an issue and the shelter needs the money to operate. I look at these adoption fees as a donation effectively. Should someone who can't afford $85 take on the financial commitment of pet ownership? There is the argument that perhaps it's better for the animal to have a family who struggles to provide it with good food and medical care versus being stuck in a shelter (or put down). If a shelter is overflowing and begins giving animals away in desperation (my local shelter had a free cat day once) you have to question if all these animals are going to good homes. But some home is better than death right? Probably, other than in extreme cases of mistreatment.

pics,fcro6s1,t1_fcqhrny,1577904385.0,"Electrification of automobiles is great, but it really misses the point of fixing climate change. In fact it plays to our current mindset that has gotten us into this mess in the first place. We're being told that our job is to accept and buy electric vehicles. They are made attractive by good performance and low running costs. What's really happening is that companies are using climate change to sell us another product.

The real problem is how long do you think you should keep a car? 5, 10 years? Why isn't 20 years standard? We could build cars better, albeit being more expensive initially, to last longer and reduce manufacturing pollution in the long run.

Then there is all the shit like cheaply built everyday items that have replaced things you bought a few times at most in your life, which were sold and taken care of by specialists. At one point you could keep kitchen knives and other supplies your entire life. Non stick pans that wear out every 5 years instead of using cast iron for life. Cheap fridges and dishwashers that break after 10 years and its cheaper to just buy a new one. This instead of repairing what you had and preventing the environmentally costly process of making a new one.

Basically every single thing sold at a store like Walmart is to blame for climate change. Cheap things are horrible for the environment, and horrible for your budget because it's often better to spend big once and end up with a superior product in the process. However companies don't want a young adult to inherit their grandparent's kitchen supplies and not need to buy anything. Or be able to go out and buy a used 20 year old fridge that will work for another 30 years. Heck, even the way we build our houses is cheap.

Reducing consumerism of cheaply made products would put people at stores like Walmart out of work as they close down. But then we'd need specialists to repair and sell all the better built versions of those products. Even better it would hurt manufacturing in China and fuel local growths of economies around the world. But this isn't in the interest of big corporations who own our politicians and buy our advertising. 

TLDR: So while I agree electrification is good, its over focusing our attention on one area of climate change. Our incessant consumerism of cheap garbage is something we need to stop. Better yet we have the technology already to stop today. You don't need better batteries or charging stations to build products that are repairable and durable."

worldnews,fcjpjj6,t1_fcjawmb,1577698155.0,"Electrifying shipping and heavy transportation should be another priority, maybe even more so. Moving personal transport to electric is all good, but only one part of the problem. Its convenient for corporations because it shifts the burden of climate change onto consumer choice as opposed to manufacturing. 

I'm also concerned with such laws accelerating the disposal of otherwise functioning vehicles. The modern car can last 30 years if built correctly (see all the 90s Corollas and Civics on the road) and it would be a shame for people to dispose of them just to grab a tax incentive on a shiny new electric car. I respect the Cubans for retrofitting their cars from the 50s for decades. A proper response to climate change would be the conversion of gas cars to electric. Imagine Honda or Toyota building all new Civics and Corollas now to support batteries and electric engines when they improve in the future. It would be an engineering problem to solve for sure. It would seem less insurmountable if we had been designing products for the last few decades to be accommodating of future technology. Instead modern products, including cars now exist only for use in the present with little forward thinking to keep them functional in the future with an upgrade path instead of a replacement one. However no company is interested in selling you less. The real response to climate change would involve a reduction in manufacturing. Instead it is being used, and baked into government policy, to justify selling you another new car."

HeadphoneAdvice,fc9t85r,t3_egs76r,1577557867.0,"I have the 280pros. I've listened to the Vic Firths at a Guitar Center alongside a demo model of my 280s. The sound quality of the Vic Firths are an entire level below the 280s. I noticed the highs were especially harsh. However the Vic Firths isolate way way better than the 280s. I'd be sceptical if the 280s could protect your hearing adequately around drums. Playing drums the Vic Firths would be great. However, even for casual listening I wouldn't find the sound quality adequate.

IEMs are another good option for noise isolation. Less convenient to wear if you're removing them all the time, but much better isolating than the 280s and generally most headphones. I'd recommend this form factor since they can sound good and isolate very well. 

Make sure you can find frequency vs db reduction charts for anything you buy. Peak db reduction numbers mean nothing since most headphones do very well at killing high frequencies, few actually isolate well throughout the whole range."

HeadphoneAdvice,fc0ktb3,t3_efii3u,1577293225.0,"My tinnitus is apparently minor (so I've figured from reading about it) and been a life long condition (so not caused by loud noise, which maybe will change how I react to it compared to others). Mine is also heightened from stress and congestion. One of these things I should see an ENT specialist about because there might be some medical options out there. But when you're born with it the affect on your life isn't as significant compared to those who experience tinnitus free hearing before.

I really like IEMs because while you can hear your tinnitus more when music is off since they're essentially ear plugs blocking all noise you can also listen to music at much quieter volumes. This in turns aggravates my tinnitus less and I feel better about protecting my hearing. As I walk between loud and quiet environments I never have to adjust the volume. If I were you I'd first buy a pair of $50ish ones off Amazon that are well reviewed and see how you like them before going all the way in. You can save them for exercise etc.

After listening to music and removing them after a couple hours the whole world sounds too loud. People talking seem to be yelling, ventilation units roar and so on. It indicates how much noise they are blocking, how quiet you can listen to music since your sensitivity adjusts to the new base level. I've noticed myself turning down the volume on my stereo setup and in the car as well. I'm also misophonic (if that's a word) about certain noises like coworkers sucking in their own snot every 5 minutes all day and IEMs block that all out!"
