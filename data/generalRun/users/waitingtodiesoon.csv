Multiple dispensers of sanitizer everywhere by the entrance and along the buffet line. Employees standing at the entrance saying washee washee to get you to let them spray your hand with more hand sanitizer.
worldnews,fgskt8u,t1_fgsan3v,1581086822.0,"Depends on the cruise. My family we like cruises for some of the food, experience, and visiting new places. Though the ship board time limits what you can do. Like the hawaii cruise one we did have decent time to explore the islands we went too. The Scandinavian cruise from Copenhagen to St. Petersburg we had plenty of time to explore Talinn, Estonia, 2 nights in Stockholm Sweden, etc. We book our own cars to drive to see our stuff and avoid excursions. We look up public transportation for efficient routes to reach where we want to go and avoid the big tour groups if we can. The rooms are just some place to sleep. 

Some cruises I been on are boring during the night and day. The Scandinavian one was mostly older people and the ship had like 6 clubs on it. 4 of them were empty every night. Not much else to do really. 

Symphony of the Sea is my favourite next to Liberty of the Sea and the Carnival one I did in Galveston. [Symphony](https://youtu.be/qssvMeGbEPU) of the Sea had 2 waveboarding, zipline, minigolf, ice rink/laser tag, basketball court, 5 ping pong tables, 3 water slides, a slide from like the 16th floor to the 7th floor I think and, a full Broadway show and [acrobatic](https://youtu.be/ClJTjA-XxU4) show. I saw them twice. These are all free part of your ticket. Speciality dining of course cost money and most not worth. Except Symphony had a bunch of free place. A pizza place, the cafe with free paninis, cookies, sandwiches which is late night. An burger and hot dog grill, one floor above. The buffet on the top. The sit down formal one. 

The carnival cruise had really good free guy ferri bbq and burgers."
worldnews,fgsjcwr,t1_fgsh1hd,1581085807.0,"Mcs sit down dining was very hit or miss and most nights it was meh. Upstairs buffet for dinner had decent selection, but their hamburgers and hot dogs were tragically horrible. Nuggets too. Their pizza was amazing. The sit down dining didn't even have the standard steak option that is normally on the default menu that never changes. Also I was reading the signs that say what type of food is in that area and I read the food below and it was like pork dumplings but the sign above said vegetarian. I took a snap for fun to show my friends and I walked around the corner to see what else was there and the worker behind there walked around and when I walked back I saw him removing the vegetarian sign. Next day I went back the sign was up again with meat options and I saw the worker and he saw my phone and he sent someone to go remove it shortly after. The rest of the days I never saw that sign again lol. I wasn't going to take a picture that day again too I felt bad  

Best burger and hot dogs I had was Carnival I forgot which but one of the ones in Galveston. They all have guy Ferri  burger and bbq places or most.

Even the skinny stewardess hit it while bringing ice. The symphony of the Sea inside cabin at least had a couch along with 2 beds so had somewhere else to lay and sit. Would not recommend MCS grandoisa unless upgraded rooms. At least $500 or so for a 7 day cruise around Europe was a good price. Their app also had free messaging.

She fought Kylo the same way Luke fought Vader. Both outmatched by their adversary but both with a very important order. Bring them alive to their master. Not to mention Kylo was winning heavily that caused Rey to run away quite far before she got trapped. Kylo was also heavily wounded from a bowcaster blast that kills normal men in 1 shot that also launches them into the air. Kylo was also suffering from immense emotional turmoil as he is still being pulled by the light and killing his father did nothing to help him feel the dark path he is taking is worth it. Also Kylo Ren never was a Sith. They also explained how she got those high level skills in Rise of Skywalker though they already hinted at when. Kylo and Rey are a dyad in the force. Equal in the force. When Kylo force mind probed Rey he established their bond and you saw her resisting and in doing so she got into his mind and gleaned a few secrets. It was at that moment Kylo unknowingly also gave her other force knowledge and skills. Also Rey opened herself to the force to help guide her in beating the heavily wounded Kylo. 

Also fantasy/fiction/scifi movies have leeway in allowing one skill to transfer to others. Luke for all we knew never practiced on a X-Wing but can fly one all was said he was one of the best pilots on tattoine we never see any training for it.
