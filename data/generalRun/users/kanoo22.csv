HealthInsurance,fc0h4qd,t3_ef9ex2,1577290723.0,"Check out Direct Patient Care.
Aka DPC
Many drs are offering coverage to their patients themselvea. Meaning no insurance needed.
Depending on who u want to cover u pay about 60 a month (those are the rates in fla)
The dr will see u forall ur routine services and specialist servicea including writing scripts.
Look into it. 
Direct Patient Care
Its changing the Health Care environment."
