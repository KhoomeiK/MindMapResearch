Nothing I said was sheep-like or fearful. You're an imbecile if you don't think there is grey area around interpreting what you said, or if saying that is productive.

Shoestring,fcum5w6,t3_eixbev,1577983998.0,"If you take 275 over to Tampa, International Mall is only a mile from the interstate. It might be a good place to stretch your legs a bit, maybe grab some food, and they have a decent(and free) little kids play area. Some of the worst traffic will be actually crossing the bridge, so by the time you get over it you can decide if you want to just keep going or stop.

Maybe check out Cypress Point Park too. It's right on the bay and by the highway. They have a beach area, decent playground, bathrooms, etc."

You save everyone else a shit load of time and establish credibility regarding a statement you made."
