climbing,fflzwaj,t1_ffjabez,1580046337.0,"I joined my uni's climbing group this year and I did have experience climbing before so maybe I'm not the best to give advice, but something our group did was to not have the old members climbing at first. At our very first session we were grouped in 3s, one experienced climber and two new members. The experienced climber taught us how to tie knots and belay. It works well for those like me who had done it before but forgotten the specifics, and those who are new to it don't get intimidated by watching someone crushing right away.

As for the intimidation thing I can't say I ever felt it, but my group is very mixed ability and any success is celebrated, basically. The first time I climbed a V3 bouldering, I got a high five from the guy who can flash a V7. I think as long as everyone's supportive of each other at any ability the intimidation will go away pretty soon."

I think demisexual would fit me but it's not my sexuality, and I don't think it is a sexuality. It's like.... a way of experiencing attraction, maybe. Just like having a very high sex drive and attraction to lots of people. It's just one end of a bell curve."

The surgery enables you to lose weight faster, and someone that weight is going to struggle to continue restricting.

It's less alteration and more using the old clothes as a sheet of fabric. These big ugly dresses can go for like £2 or less, whereas the equivalent amount of fabric new would cost much more. As for time and equipment, they do it for fun.

I would suggest trying the grid method of sketching for portraits. When I want my picture to be really accurate I always use it, as do my friends who draw portraits.  
[Here](https://www.art-is-fun.com/grid-method) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNFIuVws5EA) are some links to explain if you don't know what it is. When you first try grid method it won't be perfect, but practice really helps you get an eye for the proportions."

fatlogic,fcjqufa,t3_ehc4u9,1577700021.0,"Big women outnumber the skinny ones in my family too, and the skinny ones also tend to become big. That's part of the reason I come to this sub, I would rather take after my dad's side of the family. My maternal grandmother was huge - in the 70s she was over 20 stone. My mother and her sisters are all pretty big now. My paternal grandmother is 76 and has never been larger than a size 12 and that's only because she has wide hips, and the same for my aunt on that side. You could easily say its genetic looking at my family history but it's really obvious if you actually look at my familys habits - my dad's side are all reasonably active, enjoy healthy cooking as much as they enjoy baking cakes, and even my grandmother keeps busy. My mother's side are chronic snackers and don't have active lifestyles.
You don't have to do what your family did"

I don't typically wear a lot of black but I fell in love with it. plus it's shiny enough to satisfy my urge to wear something shiny for NYE - I've been coming out of my basic-outfit comfort zone this year and last year I was just wearing a tank top and jeans so this is a step up
SubredditDrama,fcgjchk,t1_fb7msx9,1577640758.0,"re the thumbnails, I think those thumbnails make it clear that ALR knows exactly why people watch her videos. She loves to act like she's going to make a huge change and she's really gonna do it this time but her thumbnails are of the worst shots of her, or of her eating a huge plate of food, etc. She's shown herself to be pretty appearance-concerned so she definitely does that on purpose, either for clickbait or for feeders. I think she sees her weight as a good thing for her youtube, she knows it's why people watch. I don't think she's fully realised it'll kill her at this rate."

It's the tiniest bit tight on my ribcage but a size up would've swallowed me. I'm going to wear black tights with it, I've considered tiny hole fishnets but they might be too many patterns together. Not sure what shoes I'll wear as I really don't have many but I might just wear my black doc marten boots - I am a big fan of pretty feminine dresses with huge stompy boots. 

My only issue is finding a bra to wear with it - the plunge is fairly deep and so far the only bra I have that doesn't show is a calvin klein bralette. I might just go with it, bras in my size are expensive and it doesn't look bad."

also semi related but the second part of the comment is something I've never understood - i've had several friends tell me they can no longer enjoy certain social networks or online communities because of the people in them and i'm like: just block them? it's not hard. hell, i'm into kpop and that community can be awful sometimes but i've got myself a little safe zone on twitter because i just unfollow or mute anyone who is driving me crazy."

I refuse to hide it anymore, but if I absolutely had to pretend to be straight to avoid being killed or something, it would be possible for me - though some gay people cannot hide it whether they try or not. You can't hide fat, but you also can't really discriminate against something that 70% of people are. That's a majority. Also, fat people aren't oppressed or legally discriminated either. They aren't refused opportunities because they're fat. FAs cry discrimination because they don't like to be told that they're unhealthy."
