My parents now love the name. It's a weird name, nothing offensive or anything like that, and people usually just say ""Oh"" when they hear it. But people who know where it's from love it.

That kid is starting to realise that it's wrong maybe at age 14. At that point, they have been taught this bad habit for 14 years! It's easy to think that they do this to themselves. Often there's also some kind of emotional trauma behind the eating habits. It's easy to say fat people are at fault and yes, at some ways, they are. But I had anorexia and it did not help when people said to me just eat. I grew up in a family with fucked up eating habits, I had no idea what is normal. You can't even imagine how difficult it was to start from the beginning and learn to eat right. So instead of blame, if they could get some help, it would probably work much better. The biggest problem is to get them to understand that they are obese and it's dangerous. And my family tree is full of fat people who think they are as healthy as you can be"

It's not a state of mind, it's not a synonymous to all eating disorders (this annoys me so much, because there's eds that are just as serious) and it is certainly as or more dangerous as being overweight. Anorexia is not just dieting. You lost drastic amount of weight and that's amazing. Our situation is still not the same, even though we both lost weight. I was at normal weight and I developed an ED and anorexia and I was diagnosed as an anorexic, which means that I was dangerously underweight. I was literally killing myself, I was not an obese person losing weight (which I'm not diminishing, because that's seriously amazing and I wish more people could do it).

We are trying to get rid of comments like: she's such a b*tch, she looks like a plastic sex doll, he's an abusive piece of sh*t narcissist, etc that we have gotten a lot more lately and most of the users complained about in our mod poll. Also if your post is on the line of being removed, we will message you and ask you to edit it a bit. We aren't going to remove comments that are like I'm worried about Kanye's mental health and how it affects their family. Or I don't understand why Khloe felt the need to change herself this much.

I hope this clears things a bit. We will make a bigger post about it later."

You shouldn't force them to jog up and down the stairs, but if they use them voluntarily when they are able to, it doesn't harm them. It's an old myth"
