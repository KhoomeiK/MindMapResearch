AskReddit,fed97yq,t3_eo6l00,1579004388.0,"Don't know if this counts but a teacher was teaching ww1 and my sister kept correcting her on things she was getting a bit wrong (due to popular opinion etc, teacher was lazy and my sister was a history buff). It for to the point where the teacher said that what our great grandfather did in the war didn't exist so she pulled it up on the Internet. Teacher told her that if she knew so much, she should teach the class. Well.... My sister has adhd and at the time was unmedicated, so she did just that. She got up and for the remaining hour flawlessly delivered a lesson. She even handed out the set homework. The class applauded her said they actually learnt stuff, while she got a detention (which she didn't attend... Or the incurring ones for missing them).
Probably my favourite story of my sisters antics in school."

WeightLossAdvice,fed6axd,t1_fed3wgn,1579000974.0,That makes me feel better thank you! The only time I was chiseled more was when I looked really underweight so I'm probably one of the unfortunate ones!
WeightLossAdvice,fed01z2,t1_feczwtx,1578991926.0,I'm 22 so possibly. I just seem to yo yo past few yrs from a face shape to being full.
WeightLossAdvice,feczzam,t3_eoi7r4,1578991824.0,"1st of all: well done!! You've done really well! Keep at it :) 

For the boobs: weights are really good. I've never been so perky in my life!! Obviously focus on the chest area exercises but I found that ones that also effect the back helped too :) you don't have to go the gym either with some of the exercises (I think it makes it harder without the big machines anyway so may find more effect that way?). Plus exercises like push ups and planking I think can help too but I'm not 100% sure. Hope this helps a little."
