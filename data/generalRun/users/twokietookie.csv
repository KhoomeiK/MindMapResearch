Another aspect is being able to not allow your spending to inflate to match your higher income. His ego or self worth isn't tied to what car he drives or what he enjoys for breakfast. That's a powerful thing. 

The major cocaine king pin of LA in the 80s, Rick Ross, has a great view on this. He's known for always keeping a low profile after his first jail stint for GTA. He was stealing cars to pimp out his low rider. While in jail he realized he had nothing to show for all the work and risk besides a car that bounces. He lived in his mom's garage. 

He says, to him, a car that bounces was the ultimate achievement of man. He ends up crushing the car at a junk yard symbolically. Later makes a drug empire worth hundreds of millions.

Not better not worse, but what I say and how I connect with a client won't be the same. Hone your story, because that makes you genuine to the client""

So don't hesitate to tell a client you don't know something: that's a fantastic question, let's find out. If you have other accomplishments you're proud of work it into conversation. Let them see you as a go-getter up and comer. Nothing wrong with the underdog story.

The first few times I closed large contracts it was unreal someone trusted me with that much of their money. After a while it's comfortable and you have the self confidence to know that they made the right choice and they're in good hands.

Something that I think most sales people need to do is detach yourself from the sale. Don't be thinking about ""if I don't close this and 3 more this week I'm not going to make rent"". I was totally terrified my first week. Going into doctors million dollar homes trying to sell a product I was unfamiliar with. After a while I took on the attitude of 

""My job is to chat with people. If I have 3 appointments in a day I want to make 3 new friends""

Kind of like the public speaking trick of imagining people in their underwear. Just act like they're new folks you just met and they're soon to be your friend. Keep the topic of a sale to a minimum. Let the conversation flow and ask questions about who they are. If you're likeable they will buy. The closing tricks can come later. Just get out there and keep conversation for now."

Our market is quite saturated with window companies as well.

Your description above about generating easy sales has got me motivated to go knock doors. Typically we get leads and someone in the office adds it to our calendar. Canvasing isn't required. However, I guarantee if I spent even 2 hours a day knocking doors around jobs in progress I'd create those easy deals. Canvasing leads are great.

Asking the right questions and listening is key. Also being observant. I do remodeling sales, so it's important for me to see what they've done around the house. New a/c unit? Did they go with a budget unit or invest in something nice?

Here are the results if you don't want to click.
Volvo D4 vs Tesla model S

Volvo - 4.800 liters per 100km
Tesla - 4.460 liters per 100km with all charging coming from a much smaller generator than shown in the pic @30kw

The Model S is not a machine geared towards optimal efficiency. It's fast as hell and fairly luxurious. Model 3 would probably yield even better results but I'm speculating.

pics,fe4zbpn,t1_fe4xdq7,1578864200.0,"25% of US energy comes from petroleum. If they were so inefficient then electric cars wouldn't be viable. There's pretty significant line loss from power station to your house as well. I think they say electric vehicles net 200+ mpg when you do the math back to the generator. Electric cars also scale with our move away from fossil fuels too.

Obviously a smaller unit like the one pictured above isn't as efficient as one supplying the grid. Hopefully we can agree that one large power plant is more efficient than hundreds of small engines."

It's all about keeping the engine at low rpm at optimal temperature (hot enough to completely burn fuel but not degrade oil)."

This at 9: ""Trump's poll numbers down 3 points after articles of impeachment""
""Bernie may be in trouble for being seen as weak on wars""


That's more entertaining to the masses than:

""Trump likely to be reelected due to gerrymandering and Facebook Russia money""
""Bernie leading the pack due to anyone with a basic grasp of the past 3 years wanting to return to a stable reality"""
todayilearned,fe4idvk,t1_fe45lhq,1578859607.0,"I think you're over simplifying. Most people who sell drugs do it to support a habit. People who make REAL money off drugs are not the norm. People deal drugs because it's either lack of opportunities or perceived lack of opportunities. Live in their shoes for a day with all the paranoia, dealing with drug addicts and keeping odd hours always on call - you'd want your 9-5 back. 

Likely the same is true here. These guys risk getting shot at and long prison sentences if caught. Lack of opportunity is the reason they're willing to kill a rhino for say 5k and then the middle men make all the money with limited risk until the end user pays six figures. If you told these guys they can make $10 an hour protecting the rhinos I'd bet money they would think they hit the big time."
news,fe4bjzk,t1_fe49qb8,1578857615.0,"There are a lot of bad people around the world. Putting our goodwill at risk with the rest of the world to do a hit like this is rediculous. If you think this makes us safer or the world a better place in any real way, that's just wishful thinking. We've only proven their point that they kill us because we kill them. ISIS, Iran, any terrorist organization no longer has to make up propaganda. They just have to tell their side of the story, the facts. It'd be great to go around the globe and Rambo it into a more ""peaceful"" ""safe"" world, but if you think that's effective anywhere besides Hollywood you've got a skewed outlook on how the world works."

Check out my post history, I found a bunch of neat ones before it started freezing, didn't think there'd be much out there. I'm a total newbie so thanks for posting, I like to go on walks off path around American River and it's surprising how much exercise I get in without even noticing."
AskReddit,fdz04xc,t3_enanr4,1578785388.0,"On another note ""Tssss tsss"" is a universal language. When I was in Beijing there are people around who will really hassle you trying to sell little trinkets or postcards. One of the people I was with kept trying to be polite and say no thank you and walk around but these guys were persistent and kept cutting us off. So I hit em with a tsss tsss tsss. They got the hint, used that for the remainder of the trip. Might sound like in a jerk but really you can't underestimate how persistent they are."

Sound bites - primary source - video with citations for everything in context, but put together into a timeline that explains the story. 

I'd think with all the talent here on Reddit we'd be able to crowd source something that could easily open the eyes of many voters. Make it engaging, neutral, fact based, yet entertaining. Sell a story; it should be easy given the drama of the past few years. 

We have enough people here to do something like that. Test reaction, tweak it, test it again, then instead of sending $18 a piece on average to Bernie, we spend it on a message of critical thinking to enlighten voters of the sham cult and let them decide on their own."

Never seen it before, but maybe I'll lay it out next time I do some subway. I'm not sure I love it, but what you have there definitely looks like quality work! Maybe I'm just a sucker for subway tile. Regardless, as I tell all of my clients: do what you like because you're the one who has to live with it."

sousvide,fb6xacr,t3_ebl4p1,1576563884.0,"You're going to never go back to chicken without Chipotle with adobo. I tried it a few months back. The spice doesn't overwhelm at all (although I'm a spice nut). The smoky flavor soaks through. Used it on some tritip I make into roast beef too. (Overnight at 137 then slice it cold for sandwiches, no searing). Gives it that BBQ flavor without having to fire up the grill."
