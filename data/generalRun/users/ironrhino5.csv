Why? Of course regulations can hinder the bottom lines for even big corporations, but big corporations can take the hit/make the changes/hire the people to adapt to the new regulations. Smaller companies cannot. The regulation even if it isn't written by big businesses themselves effectively protects them from new competition. Wanna know why Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc were so against net neutrality removal? It is because they wanted the small start up to share the same space as them so that they could crowd out the small competition. Now a startup could buy a ""fast lane"" or some kind of advantage from an ISP and pull customers from the major players.

This process was slow

A few things with this. Is therapod a kind? If not, chickens and dinosaurs are still a completely separate kind with no relation. Why couldn't it be that the velociraptor and archaeopteryx were simply just their own distinct animals and not transitional? Also, if the process was so slow there must have been millions of generations that died. Transitional fossils are few and far in between and from what I have read are routinely debunked some time after discovery. This seems counterintuitive to the fact that there should be dozens if not hundreds of these transitional fossils out there given the large number of ""missing links"" that supposedly should have lived at some point.

> Darwin's idea is simple -- descent with modification and selection by fitness of the progeny. Rinse and repeat. The predictions from that, from small changes like bacterial antibiotic resistance to big ones like speciation (http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html) all have been directly observed and behave exactly how evolution would predict.

This is something that a Creationist would agree with you on. Creationists don't deny that evolution exists; they just differ in the extent to which evolution occurs. What you said, bacterial antibiotic resistance to big ones like speciation, all are microevolution. Where Creationists and evolutionists differ, however, is when it comes to evolving into a different kind. There is no evidence to support that a dinosaur turned into a chicken. The reason why is simple. Correct me if I am wrong, but Darwinian theory relies almost exclusively on mutation to explain how we got so many different kinds of animals. Mutation occurs at the DNA level. A mutation can be either beneficial or detrimental and can either add or gain information. To get a new kind, you would have to have thousands if not millions of mutations that added information spread between thousands of generations. Each one of those mutations also would need to be beneficial to the organism else it would hurt its chance of survival. Now I understand that these mutations do occur, for example some humans have a mutated gene that lets them digest other animal's milk into adulthood, but for the vast majority of mutations they are very detrimental or subtract information from the gene pool. This goes starkly against the one common ancestor theory. Either that ancestor would have an unholy amount of genetic information in a single primitive cell from the start or those mutations occurred over the generations which is basically statistically impossible. 

>You are invoking an all-knowing, all-powerful force to let's say, evolve an eye, where that all-knowing all-powerful force doesn't have any role in any of the other observations where standard evolution is easy to justify.

No, I am saying that God created the eye. I am saying that God created everything.

> Lastly, there's a nihilism that comes with young-earth creationism that sometimes is mocked under the ""Last Thursdayism"" theory -- if God is all powerful and created an earth with all of these fossils, he could have done it in an October 6000 years ago or he could have done it last Thursday.

One thing that I will pick out of this is that popular thought in Creationist circles isn't that he created the Earth with fossils in it already. We believe they were buried rapidly through various natural disasters or accidents. I'm not sure what you're point is though with that paragraph though.

>Rule over it. Name the animals and the plants. In essence, *study* them. Do biology. Classify them, figure out how to use them. What have we learned by studying them and by breeding them? Evolution. How is this against God's plan?

Again, I am not sure what exactly you are trying to say. Do you think that Creationism is just a movement to discredit science as a whole?

Doesn't that mean that a non-created universe is just as ludicrous to you as a created one since there is no way to distinguish between the two? The Big Bang is just as vacuous as Creation. Literally any prediction could be made off of it because no one has the foggiest idea of what actually happened.

This article is simple, but it logically presents faults with an old universe worldview which I thought was relevant given the original post and references the appropriate sources. If this isn't research, I don't know what is."

Creation science is unscientific because creation science is unscientific.. lol got it buddy.

Uhhh we obviously have seen different material then because the stuff I have seen makes plenty of predictions,
