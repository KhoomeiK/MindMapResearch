See how utterly fucking stupid that sounds? Replace knife with gun, and you have the US.

Cyberpunk,feebceh,t1_feeaitx,1579030251.0,"Downforce is literally downward force.

If you add a spoiler to a car, it is angled so that it pushes the car into the ground. The faster you go, the more downforce it produces.

The benefit of this is that you can have faster cornering speeds because you have more grip. However, due to the increased drag on the car, it usually reduces the top speed.

Variable downforce, such as in what is shown in the post, allows the car to adjust the amount of downforce at any given moment. If a car is cornering right really hard, you're going to want more downforce on the rear right of the car, because the weight will be transferred to the front left."
