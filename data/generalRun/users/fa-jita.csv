funny,feku5fk,t1_feknppm,1579207659.0,"She got exactly what she deserved. The first thing you are taught around horses is to be close and calm when at the back of them. She ran up and slapped the horse - no pain, but probably gave it a fright. Its natural instinct kicked in, literally. This is whatcha get."

cats,fehh34o,t1_fegpoc4,1579116397.0,"I lost two cats within 8 days of each other last year. Both 5 and a half. Both totally and utterly unexpected. I have been fostering and am about to foster fail two kittens. I am also adopting a dog. 

All I can think about is them getting sick and dying. It's awful. I have to hope that the love in my house helps me to enjoy the now and stop thinking about that rush to the emergency vet again...

Edit: typo."

movies,fea9pb7,t1_fe9qr20,1578946023.0,"First of all, let me say that I thought The Joker was just a shallow remake of so many other films - even ripping off entire scenes from Dark Knight and Taxi Driver. 

Sure it truly was shot well, & Joaquin was good (Ledger is still my Joker) but by no means would I class this as an Oscar worthy film as a whole. 

""A smart film for dumb people"" is about right. The whole rewind scene was just groan worthy. 

And for God's sake, no more breaking of pearls.

Edit: I haven't seen Little Women and have no opinion on it. Just thought I'd share my opinion on Joker."

Please refer to him as smoko, Scotty from marketing (he particularly hates this, plus it ensures everything he says has an underlying 'marketing spin' feel to it) or Engadine Maccas."
