Most Infantry guys I’ve met don’t give a shit about who you are or what you do as long as you take care of business. If you can be relied on to “go to war”, there’ll be no problems with the individual people.

Where you’ll run into challenges is the *institution* of the Infantry. You’ll be a brand new element for a lot of your leadership. There will be some growing pains as they learn to account for things particular to women that they’ve never had to deal with before. Know what you’re entitled to, and be respectful but firm about getting it. You have certain hygiene requirements related to menstruation that men seldom consider until confronted with them - don’t allow your leadership to put you in a position where you’re going to cause yourself harm. There are other general requirements for sanitation and hygiene - showers and bathrooms, for example. 

Just don’t forget that you are a human being entitled to dignity and respect. You will meet some shitheads, sure. But they don’t matter.

Rooting for you. Go get ‘em, champ."

Edit: Nope. Easter in 1992 was on the 19th of April. In 2020 it will be on the 12th of April. 

I seem to recall that the Jewish calendar is lunar, so it’s likely that Yom Kippur and Passover (likely Eid and Ramadan as well) also fall on different dates. 

Fun fact: Easter falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon after the (vernal) equinox."
