cats,feljvly,t3_epjsv9,1579223934.0,"Just know you are not alone...there are a ton of cat lovers out there!  I had 15 cats when I was doing TNT.  I had 32 cats in my town fixed.  I wound up with almost half of them.  That also includes ferals in the house.  I’m no longer the crazy cat lady.  Last year I lost my husband, his cat passed away the day after Christmas.  No one really understands how much we love our animals.  None of my friends understand.  I never had kids but these cats are my fur babies.  Each time one goes over the rainbow bridge, you think it will get easier.  It would have been easier to pull my arm out of the socket than to watch another one leave.  Keep your CATITUDE and hang with animal lovers.  Just remember all the good times you had with your cat and know that she tried her best to stay by your side."
