Since you just bought the car and can't be sure about the brakes' service history it makes sense to take off the wheel and look at the remaining disc thickness from a more radial direction. Some people in misguided attempts to save money only replace the pads and leave the discs in if they still have some miles left. Problem with that is that only the pads have built-in acoustic wear indicators or contacts. So it can happen that the fairly new pads tear apart the end-of-life disc and shred the brake line, calipers, rim, etc.

When those become too big the track can still be used but only at reduced speed before it is repaired.

Cartalk,fdc4hd3,t1_fdbx04f,1578266936.0,"Ok, apparently the car was sold with CVT and torque converter. I know very little about CVTs. If you have one I'd guess you never feel a ""step"" during normal driving as you would with other transmission types. Some please enlighten me how correct this is. For now I'll assume you have a torque converter.

In which driving situations does the needle rise? How suddenly does the increase appear? And what's the highest you see?

City traffic with stop and go comes with the highest fuel consumption, especially when going uphill. A slight increase in temperature is expectes there and nothing to worry about. In addition, the transmission fluid in your torque converter gets its cooling via the same radiator as your engine, it heating up will therefore also contribute to the temperature needle rising. A torque converter roughly consists of two turbines in an oil bath. The energy transfer that is usually mechanical to mechanical. When you stop your car in D the engine side is still turning but the transmission side is held in place by the brakes and now mechanical energy only heats up the transmission fluid.

These two factors plus the car moving very slowly and therefore not getting much airflow over the radiator can lead to a noticeable increase in coolant temperature. As long as the needle doesn't go into the red, that's completely fine. Of course it's not optimal for the car but it's designed to take city traffic or other traffic jams as well.

All of this is of course completely irrelevant if you have an automatic start/stop system active."
