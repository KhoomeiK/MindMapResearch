Shit you could be a 3' dude and carry yourself like a man and no one ( save for a few assholes who are ignorable) will think you any thing less than. 

You got this!"
raisedbynarcissists,ff29cbh,t1_ff29583,1579497651.0,Jesus. Yeah i have an extension of my own to the list and its basiclly another 10.. mostly about medical~emotional~finacial abuse
raisedbynarcissists,fez2kdv,t1_fewr03t,1579453258.0,Someone else on this thread found the original list on tumblr.
raisedbynarcissists,fez29z0,t1_fez184o,1579453180.0,You could probably find my reblog of the list if you scroll through the notes.
raisedbynarcissists,fez184o,t1_fez0py2,1579452964.0,Actually. I belive it was the second post on that list. The Checklist of was I abused.
raisedbynarcissists,feyefg2,t1_fewr03t,1579444363.0,I can try to find it for you. If not ill rewrite it up from the screen shots i have and edit it into my post/mame a new post depending.
raisedbynarcissists,feyebly,t1_fewswno,1579444312.0,The list wasnt even a complete list. People had extensions at the bottom.
raisedbynarcissists,fep7sna,t1_fep73u4,1579314057.0,"Ive confronted her on this and the only thing she can say in defense of it is "" I didnt see you"" and all i have to think is "" bitch wtf do you think im doing standing in the bathroom for two minutes? ""

Not to mention ill say goodnight and theyll both put up a ruchus untill 11. And then shell pound on my door telling me to go to sleep already. Because sheheard me open up a video to try and sleep to something soothing.

Its mostly just fucking annouying. Expecially when im already pissed off."

raisedbynarcissists,fep6e9q,t1_feosnz7,1579313161.0,"I will never forgive my mother.  I am allowed to hate her. My hate for her is the only reason i am still breathing. 

People are allowed to hate. Don't tell people they shouldn't hate the people who have made their lives a living hell. It makes you seem like an asshole."
raisedbynarcissists,fep5h1o,t1_fep38jc,1579312564.0,"My mother will see me brushing my teeth before heasing to bed and deliberately say "" Go brush your teeth and head to bed its late!"" 

Even if im already mid- action on my way to do just that on my own decision. 

I hope she will realize that everytime she told me to do something i was already doing of my own volition i actually would do the opposite."
raisedbynarcissists,feiltl8,t3_ep55hh,1579141541.0,"I still have the aching want for her to just do soemthing physical again. She had me so wound up when i was little that when she was hitting me i didnt report anything or tell anyone. Now when im trying to explain my life to others and why i have such a distain for home rn, everyone asks why i didnt say anything. Why No one noticed or ssid anything when id go to school with marks on my body and tears in my eyes. 

Id have to explain to them how shed twist everything in her favor. How this twisting had been my normal for so so long. How i didnt even realize there was anything wrong until far far too late to actuslly get help. 
And then i read about others and i feel worse."
raisedbynarcissists,feanq7d,t3_eo3bin,1578950650.0,"My mother, during the growth of her abuse, when i was in the perfect position to report it began a tirade of "" You arent abused. Look those kids on tv are abused. "" Whenever i got upset shed throw a garbage bag at my head and tlel me whatever i wanted to keep should go in there because thats all CPS would let me keep. How shes such a loving person because a foster home would never buy me books or new sheets. Or gasp. A 3 year outdated console with 1 game. 

How if I wanted to I could tattle on her and get taken away. She gave me multiple books, as i was an active reader at the time, about kids in foster homes who were badly treated, sexually abused, never adopted or cared for. Shed make comments that Id age out of the foster care system because i was too old, too skinny, too fat. Anything underthe sun that shed describe as unwanted. She convinced me, during those years of increasing horribleness, that getting help would only make things worse. And hindsight is 2020 because if any help had actually showed up i wouldnt be traumatized by my childhood. 

Its strange how such a "" Wonderful mother"" would need to constantly convince her children that any help would instantly make everything worse. How a "" Perfect mother"" who "" did everything for her children"" would have to scar a child so bad that they feared letting anyone know what was happening even when things got a whole lot worse. 

She had a book, one she forced me to read with her, about a mother who will always Love her child even if her Child is a monster. My nickname growing up was ""Monster"" and im 17 and she still will tell other people in her life that "" she has to go pick up the monster from school"" or "" my monster is sick at home."" 

Which good parent engrains it into their childs head that the child are a Monster??????????"
raisedbynarcissists,fdyr0jl,t3_en3ib9,1578782714.0,"My mother would oscillate between enjoying and hating physical affection with the wind. 

One day i could get a hug or an affectionate pat or even the mythical leting me lay and cuddle because i was and still am a big cuddle bear. 
The next day. Shit the next hour. Shed push me away and scold me for touching her at all.

At some point i just stopped pushing for physical affection at all."
raisedbynarcissists,fdeyvl4,t3_ektbkv,1578349536.0,"My mother decides to go out and do random shit. Shell drag me out with her "" Because she wants company""

Im not obliglated to be her company, but since i live with her currently, and have no intention on making more of a fuss with her than nessecary i have to go. 

I need to remind my self. 
Just because She is a Horrible person with no friends. Doesnt mean im a horrible person with no friends. She isnt supposed to act like im her therapist. Her problems arent my problems. Her life isnt my life."
raisedbynarcissists,fdexrkc,t1_fdejr3o,1578348845.0,"When they get out of the fog them selves and out from her control theyll see you again. She will never treat you like the adult you want, shell never not be a narcissist, there is no magic button to press sadly. You can try to put up with it, establish boundaries and push back all you want until your sibllings are free. But I also suggest at some point. For your own health and mental well being, go NC."
raisedbynarcissists,fde4577,t3_ekwak9,1578330767.0,"That just reminds me of a story. 

When i was maybe 9 my mother told me to go vaccum all the carpets. I was 9. Had never used the vaccum before, by myself or with her. I spend maybe 5 minutes pulling it out unwinding the cord and figuring out all the buttons and how to work it. Just before i plug it in shes there in the door way. "" What are you doing?!?"" She said, i want to say she screamed but she learned very well on how to yell with the volume of normal speach. "" You dont know what your doing why dont you ask me? Before you do anything???""
I state that i think i got it as ive watched her do it before. "" Fine then. Get to it *HupHup*"" ( hup hup was her quick phrase to say Hurry up. Stop being a lazy insolent child) I plug it in but notice the bag is full. I havent figured out how to unlock or replace the bag so i go to her, where she is now huffiliy sitting on the couch and ask her to help me undo the bag. "" You said you knew what you were doing! Figure it out! You said you didnt want my help earlier! Stop being so two faced."" And then she hit me. Spun me around and pushed me back towards the room with the vacuum. 
I spent 10 minutes trying things out, afraid to leave the room again without having finished my task. 

It took her 30more to come in to "" help"". 
She hit and berated me for being stupid and not asking for help when she told me to, emptied the bag and left me there while she went out to go get a new pack of smokes. Telling me the house should be done by the time she got home. 

She gets mad like that all the time now thst im older and assuming more tasks. When im trying to firgure something out shell get mad if i dont run to her immedietely. But she berates me for being stupid when i do. 
Critism isnt Advice. Critism isnt help. 
Do you actually read those parenting books you bought in droves? Or did you throw them away at the first piece of advice that didnt slign with your narcisistic world view?"
depression,fd02p5f,t3_ejmkt0,1578112754.0,"Besides trying to helf myself to go eat an entire pizza. Usually the only meals i can get mywelf to eat are simple 1 pot things. Hand ful of noodles. And a can of black beans and 2 tbl spoons of butter. 

Boil water. Put (usually i do broken in half spaghetti) noodles in water. Wait till they sre at desired level of noodle ness. Strain. Melt half of the butter in pot. Add garlic and onion powder. Put noodles back in pot on low heat. Strain snd rinse beans off. Put in pot. Stir in otherpiece of butter until beans are hot. Serve. 

Is it allot of beans? Yes. But sometimes its all ive had eaten all day and its nutritious enough to not give me a food headache."
depression,fcotjsc,t3_ei19sk,1577841161.0,"Im spending New years doing what i normally do at night. My mother and the only one around is watching hallmark movies. I was to unmotivated this week to make any plans at all. I havent even looked at the texts from my friends. I dont want to get them down today. 

Im not sad im alone on new years, im just sad that ive been alive for over a decade and a half and i still no will to do anything anymore."
depression,fc24ho8,t3_efppwm,1577340067.0,"I dont km now if it was depression but ive deleted thousands of messages. I feel like a horrible person trying to reach out to other people when i have so much horribleness in my mind. I feel like im ruining everyone. I fear ever becoming a bad presence in anothers day. Ive deleted so many "" i need help"" messages to friends and family. Only to ask about their days and lie about my own. Ive deleted so much what ive deleted could probably be faxed to a therapist and instsntly have me diagnosed."
depression,fc240so,t3_cml6ni,1577339524.0,"This morning, sometime before the sun was up yet i chucked my guts for a good half an hour. It was a wonderful way to start christmas. I had crawles back into bed and layed there staring at the ceiling with this utter sense of woozy. At 8.30 i forced myself up even though i could barely stand straight to take a shower. I heaved and dry heaved behind the backdrop of the shower running until i had to do something else. Ive been consistently on and off woozy all day. The pain of its burning in my throat and the tightness in my chest was the only thing keeping me from falling over all day. I got yelled at for being unhappy. I get yelled at for not ""smiling ""( showing off the train wreck that is my mouth) wide enough. I got yelled at for walking to slow and for trying to dress nice to keep myself motivated to be nice. From 11am to 10pm i spent the day in a car or surrounded by loud people and kids. Whom i had to babysit and try not to show off how miserable i was. Horrible kids who did to me what everyone else had throughout my childhood. Made me chase them about to be included, whispered secrets between them selves. Intentionally tried to physically hurt me. Why does everyone do that??

College questions come from.everybody and i just have no idea. I cant thinking about that sort of future for myself. I dont deserve it. Throughout my life collge has loomed, my hobbies were systematically turned from fun activies into college relationships. Extra opportunities. My few passions, in art and music and writing have vanished. They want me to graduate early. And i could. But why would I? I dont have a college to go to. I dont have an idea of what to do with my life. 

I force myself to smile. To do whatever they want. I get good grades. I clean. I cook. I try to be possitive and kind hearted. I made a list of colleges, and keep my room clean and And none of it matters. Tonight was just more of an example. Nothing tonight would have changed if i wasnt there. Im not worth anything to them. 

I need therapy. But i cant have it. To be caught trying to aquire it would mean id lose all of my small support system now. Im afraid ill be institutionalized. And i cant. I cant do that. All of the stories ive heard. Itd drive me mad. Im afriad. Im afraid, in pain, and utterly alone. 

Ill probably delete this cry tomorrow. I apologise for wasting peoples time. I wish you all a happy holidays."
