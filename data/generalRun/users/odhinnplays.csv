It's Bobby roleplaying a spoiled (middleaged) child and Khalylya enabling him by roleplaying as his caregiver(not girlfriend). If it was anybody else, they'd have been featured in clips on YMH. Bobby craves attention, but doesn't *actually* care if it's positive or negative, which is why he's the only comedian that hasn't put out a ""special"", and why he hasn't written any new material in over twenty years. He uses his addictions as a weapon to hold himself hostage so that other people will let him do or not do whatever he wants just so he won't hurt himself. He won't change because he has absolutely no motivation to do so. It's his comfort zone. He's surrounded himself with yes men, and runs from anybody who will call him out on it. But, he's happy when he's running away because he's getting attention for something. This isn't going to change anything."
