YouShouldKnow,ffmm4lf,t1_ffm9vt3,1580056546.0,"It probably depends on what triggers it. I have weird triggers and even weirder “off” switches (things that halt a panic attack for me) so I’d have trouble believing it would work. Since most of the time I’m panicking over the fact that I’m panicking, it will not work if I don’t think it will. I can’t talk myself into thinking something will work."

To the day he died 17 years later he would stand with one front paw held up like it was hurting him but after a few years he forgot which paw he hurt and would switch it up."

weddingshaming,ffeme3r,t1_ffd1wpt,1579854334.0,"True, unless they knew going in that an open bar was out of their budget so never heard the open bar options. It was really reasonable though. I was afraid of having some people get carried away and having a bar bill much larger than we expected so I jumped on this fixed price for dinner and unlimited drinks thing."
EntitledBitch,ffe9evr,t1_ffdl3f0,1579840340.0,"Haha... maybe not even then. Mine could break into all our child locks so we got those really good ones that you need a magnetic key to open. Noah figured out he could use his magnetic alphabet letters to open the lock.

(I made him [the letters](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeR34-RFZMP/?igshid=1gref8s1498s1) and used little neodymium magnets on the back. I don’t think the magnets on the plastic letters you can buy would be strong enough, in case you want to test it.)

weddingshaming,ffe2a1x,t1_ffe1mq0,1579834829.0,"They still had alcohol since you couldn’t bring your own because of the venue’s liquor license and both bars were well-stocked. But we had paid for an open bar for the guests and they had a cash bar, so people snuck in to ours to save money and get free drinks. Laaaaaame. But it’s sad no one would shell out $5 to buy the bride a drink, or even go steal one for her. She had to do her own drink thievery."
AnimalsBeingJerks,ffdfoj8,t1_ffcc3n8,1579819897.0,"No man, I agree. They are more than capable of defending themselves. We should just enlist them all into the military or something. Although mandatory enlistment is a pretty un-canadian concept."

AskReddit,ffdf1m6,t1_ffbr7f8,1579819513.0,"
Honestly, sometimes this is HUGE. One parent always ends up being the “default parent” because they are around more or take care of certain tasks which means the kids always go to them when they need stuff. You can start to feel hounded a bit. 

The OFFER to take over is the only way they get a break without the weird guilt that they’re slacking off. When my husband offered to sit with our 4 year old (small plane, rows of 2) I sat by the window for the first time since he was born, slept on the plane for the first time since he was born, watched a non-animated movie on the plane with no interruptions for the first time since he was born... it was amazing."
weddingshaming,ffc95k6,t1_ffbpkzf,1579794382.0,"I was already a bit tipsy so I just laughed at her. I think it was probably more effective than yelling though, to see us all laughing at her and having to walk away with no drink. 

The venue had this great deal and we payed a fixed price per guest for dinner and open bar, so it didn’t cost us anything more, but she didn’t know that."
weddingshaming,ffbhkhh,t1_ffazld9,1579765620.0,"A friend married into a Seventh Day Adventist family and was told there was no possibility of having ANY alcohol at the wedding because of their beliefs. Her family was wonderful and accepted the difference in culture, even though they enjoyed a drink or two at celebrations, usually. 

ALL the men of her new family, including her groom, brought alcohol in concealed flasks and were drunk by the end of the night. Her dad was so pissed that they were giant hypocrites. 

I’m not saying this as a critique to Seventh Day Adventists... these ones were just assholes.

Edit: missed a word!"
weddingshaming,ffbh520,t1_ffb556l,1579765064.0,"At our wedding it took us a while to notice that people from the other wedding being held at our venue, which was a cash bar, were coming into ours to get free drinks at our open bar, then going back to their party. We noticed when the actual bride tried to get drinks from our bar, in her full dress and train and veil. 

Honestly, I felt worse that no one from her own wedding would buy that bride a drink than that they were stealing."
AskReddit,fexez59,t3_eqp44a,1579429903.0," Find support groups online, but be careful about selecting ones with earnest and kind people who sound logical to you. There are some toxic groups out there. Trust your gut on how they make you feel. 

Or just move to Canada. I have my first appt with a psychiatrist in a couple weeks thanks to universal healthcare. Can’t imagine having to fit “take care of my mental health” into my budget."
AskReddit,fexe671,t3_eqsnhv,1579429547.0,"I have made myself the opposite. Any time our son asks anything computer related I always say “oh, I don’t know about computers, wait till Dad gets home.” I’m perfectly comfortable with computers, gaming systems, and setting up anything technical, I just get sick of being the default parent since I’m home more, so I lob that ball into his court. 

It really makes me wonder how much of my (very intelligent and capable of learning anything quickly) mother’s ignorance about computers growing up was genuine. I’ll bet she could have installed a wordpress plug-in like a pro, but pretended she couldn’t remember how to open solitaire all the time."

I hate stray hair or hair clumps despite having hair myself, and I gagged twice before getting out. It was someone’s fucking art project.

We have no family close, he will not tolerate babysitters and I will not make neighbours watch him because he WILL freak out. If I was a single mom like she is I’d never leave the house, likely. Even asking the brother who is watching the nieces to also watch him is not plausible because he probably will meltdown and is too much to ask even your brother to watch with two other kids."
