southcarolina,ffarb78,t3_esik5e,1579742665.0,"My entire town was textiles. It was always small but while the mill was running, the town was prospering. It’s been about 10 years since they tore the mill down and the town has died. Most of the people left are just old families who work out of town. We have one job in town that’s more than minimum wage and it’s a boat manufacturing place."

iamatotalpieceofshit,ff7nyxa,t3_erwo1o,1579654113.0,"Hey someone must have found my ex husband on Facebook!! He would pull this argument pretty frequently even if he didn’t work. He also told me that he had a right as my husband to rape me and could divorce me if I refused. The one time I finally gave him and gave him some very unenthusiastic sex, he went to work and bragged that he’d raped me. So yeah. There are men out here that think this way."
aww,ff7fq3g,t3_erja5n,1579648502.0,Update: One of the neighbors called animal control so they cruised the neighborhood most of the day. Balto (according to my little guy) was very smart and hid out. His little puppy friend was also put out in the yard earlier today but we haven’t seen anybody at the house. My son was very heartbroken to hear about animal control and cried for an hour or so. He was still at our house this evening. Another neighbor has taken him into her house for the night. She said she would see how well he behaves and if he gets along with her dogs but would let us know how things go before anything happens to ol Balto.
aww,ff7fgjx,t1_ff6953a,1579648326.0,Aww thank you. I’m sure you’d get tired of us quickly though lol. I have a very friendly 6 year old who thinks all the neighbors want to hear about his day. We have an extremely friendly lab mix to match that likes to chase cats and make new friends.
aww,ff5uur0,t1_ff51k4f,1579611045.0,"We found our other dog at a shelter about 2 1/2 years ago and he’s been the baby ever since. He’s almost always my favorite child, except when he wants to eat trash. He spends most of his time wrestling with the kids or curled up in my bed. I love rescue dogs, it seems like I might have a new one. This big boy was waiting for me as soon as I opened the front door this morning."
aww,ff5uqrg,t1_ff5rcdv,1579610936.0,"Update because it’s now day 3, he met me at the door when I brought the dogs outside to potty this morning. It seems like his fence is locked down so between that and the collar, it definitely seems like he was put out on purpose. The good thing is, if he’s around my dog goes potty faster and stays in the yard without his lead. My dog is suddenly a lot more obedient. The bad thing is, ol Samoa Joe is still mouthing off at us like an insolent toddler when we tell him he can’t come in the house."
aww,ff4xeq0,t1_ff4x872,1579574747.0,"For the most part. He gets very mouthy if we tell him no or that he can’t come in the house. He’s very vocal with us. He did get really anxious when my dog was on the other side of the door and also when Summer wouldn’t let him lick the inside of his mouth. He did startle my kids by howling right outside the front door when the fire siren started going off. My SO is volunteer fire and rescue so if we kept him, he’d never miss a call."
aww,ff4j7ri,t1_ff4iykp,1579564909.0,Talking about him being excited?? Yeah he was trying to hump my male dog a few minutes before I took the picture. I guess he was asserting dominance but we pushed him off and put our dog up. He’s not neutered so that’s probably got something to do with it.
aww,ff4b9gm,t1_ff4atou,1579559586.0,"It doesn’t seem like our state would really do anything about it anyway, at least not until it gets hot again. I think that if dogs are outside for more than a few hours a day that you have to provide them with a shelter and water but that’s about it. My parents used to have a dog that would go in his pen for a few hours a day and animal control told them that they needed a house for him. But I also have family that keep hunting dogs in kennels year round. Those are working dogs so they don’t ever come in the house. It’s a sad state that some of these animals live in. 

I wish I could take this boy in but I don’t have the time or money for him at this point in time. Maybe if he’s still hanging out in a couple of weeks I can keep him. In the mean time, I’ll keep feeding him when I can and keep some water out for him."
aww,ff422az,t1_ff41rvo,1579553847.0,He’s probably not used to as much attention as he’s getting. He’s a really sweet boy just not very socialized or trained any.
aww,ff41xxt,t1_ff41fkt,1579553774.0,"I’m sure we’ll end up bringing him in. We’re only hesitating right now because we know he isn’t housebroken and I have a small 6 year old. Our dog grew up with the small child so is very gentle with him. We also know he’ll probably need shots and definitely need to be neutered. For now, we’ll feed him and love on him when we go outside. At least until we find out what’s going on with his owner."
aww,ff41q53,t1_ff412jk,1579553638.0,"I see it all the time in our town. Especially dogs like this. This is the second time that I’ve had a husky neighbor. Neither one of them have seemed to take care of their dogs very well. We live in the South and outside dogs are apparently a huge thing around here. Our own dog only goes outside to potty and play for a little bit but is an inside dog even though he’s a big lab mix. He seems like such a sweet boy and seems to get along with our big dog. Our little dog doesn’t like anyone except for me, the kids, and grandma."
aww,ff41ho8,t1_ff412c0,1579553492.0,He “lives” two houses down from us. We moved in here 6 months ago and his owner has never kept him in the house. I think his owner is in the hospital. We fed him and gave him some water today. He’s played with our pups when they’ve gone out to go to the bathroom.
aww,ff41bxz,t1_ff411tn,1579553393.0,"His owner lives two houses down. I think he’s currently in the hospital. His daughter and wife both live there as well. They also had a husky puppy that has disappeared recently. I don’t know if they took it inside or found it a new home. They just recently put a collar on this one and it seems like they’ve turned him out of his fence. I’ve had a former neighbor pull the same thing when they were “done” with a dog. It’s only a matter of time before someone calls animal control I’m sure. The whole neighborhood knows where he came from, I think they just chalk it up to the man being in the hospital."
aww,ff40x9e,t1_ff40pn4,1579553141.0,"He is so pretty, I bet he’d look better after a bath. His current “owner” leaves him in a dirt yard 24/7. I feel really bad for him."
aww,ff40u1j,t1_ff40lh6,1579553085.0,He seems to think he belongs. He let himself into my house earlier and started playing with my dog.
aww,ff40rwf,t1_ff40jb3,1579553047.0,"I already have two!! One was my SIL’s dog for 9 years and she dropped it off with us one night. That was almost a year ago and he’s still here. This is our neighbor’s dog officially. I have never seen anyone interact with him and half the time he doesn’t seem to have food or water. I know he’d be better off with us but there is a lot to consider. I know for a fact that he isn’t housebroken and we also a couple of kids, including a small 6 year old. Guess we’ll see how things go."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff1pjoc,t1_ff1p1yh,1579483316.0,She seems like a White Claw person honestly.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff1gi2d,t1_ff1fmq2,1579478861.0,"That is some new information to me, but very helpful. We actually just saw his neurologist back in October for possible seizures. He was a very friendly doctor and we liked him a lot so if we had to go back to him it wouldn’t be awful. I’ve had him screened before when he was 3 but they said he just acted like he was an ADHD toddler. It took two more years to get an official ADHD diagnosis. Right before he turned 6 we had a meeting with special services through the school and they diagnosed him as developmentally disabled. They worked really hard to push that diagnosis before the age cut off for services hit. The older he gets, the more flags we see for autism, probably high functioning."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff1er97,t1_ff1dbif,1579478273.0,"She’s part of the local University Medical Center where I’ve taken my son to see his Cardiologist but I thought it was super weird that she didn’t bill the insurance like most places do. Granted our dentist office is also weirdly out of network for any insurance so it seems like this is becoming more common. I’m also going to call the special services department in my local school board to see if they’ll give me any advice. Another mom in our scout group is going to see the same office for her son but they haven’t called her yet. It takes like a year and a half for them to squeeze him in because he’s over the age of 6. 

We’ve seen a child psychologist before and they had some shady practices. They wouldn’t let me be in the room with him during sessions for “his privacy.” He was 3 at the time. Turns out they were listing us under a different counselor because the counselor we were seeing wasn’t licensed to see kids like him. At the recommendation of his pediatrician we went back to the firm to see an actual licensed counselor. They were still very unprofessional. Our first appointment started an hour after our scheduled time. They also had a policy where they charged $50 for every appointment missed without 24 hour notice but ours were always on Mondays."

Just an FYI Moana and Coco are both on free form tonight. It’s the perfect weekend to watch movies about dead grandparents lol. Luckily my son doesn’t realize what day it was. Things were better today. We watched Hacksaw Ridge and he decided to roll off the end of my bed “rescuing the soldiers.”"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fezm7db,t3_eqvh7w,1579458910.0,"I’m having a down day. Yesterday was the anniversary of my grandpa’s death and I’ve been a little stressed so I’m bummed out. My son finally got a call back from a developmental pediatrician but they informed me that they don’t bill insurance so I have to pay the $550 office visit fee upfront. I’m going to try to work some overtime to make sure I get it as fast as I can before his appointment in March but business has been really slow so they’ve been trying to send people home early. They’ve also put my fiancé out of work until he brings proof of being a diabetic even though we’ve worked there for almost a year and a half with no issues. Honestly I just want to sit in my room and watch movies but I don’t want to ignore my son. It just really sucks to feel like this but nobody in my house has noticed, not even the dog. 

Sorry for the paragraph, probably just needed to vent a little."

LifeProTips,felgdbr,t1_felg5ri,1579221540.0,Ooohhh I love the OSHA violations!! During peak the rumor was that one of the temps was actually an OSHA inspector. That one went around because we were looking at getting fined like $80k due to the lithium ion battery labels. On Wednesday we had some associates who were going to call ethics. A clamp truck hit a fire extinguisher and management refused to evacuate the area where the incident happened. They just passed out masks and said to keep working.

LifeProTips,felbc0y,t1_fel89ex,1579218182.0,Maybe lol. Is your facility currently in scandal mode because someone gave an unauthorized interview about working conditions after being denied workers comp? Because that happened at my FC this week and it’s got the whole building talking.
LifeProTips,fel7t61,t1_fel7f3n,1579215920.0,"Most of our inbound department stands around talking for most of the day. Their management doesn’t really care about rate or TOT. It used to really annoy me because my manager is a hard ass about TOT but as long as they don’t stand in my way I leave it alone. I can only imagine that they feel the same way about damage errors. My manager is more concerned with TOT than anything else, including rate or damage errors. We had a really bad problem with damages during peak because we were at 110% capacity or more. A lot of damages occurred in our racks because of items sticking out of bins that got hit by PIT equipment. It was a shitshow for a good bit. I’m hoping it’s getting better as we empty the building."
LifeProTips,fel6jqg,t1_fekuviy,1579215133.0,My stowers don’t even care if the damage is catastrophic. They’ll slap that sucker on the shelf and leave it up to the picker to damage it out. Just yesterday i saw ready to stow pallets being transported to drop zones with damaged product on top. Sometimes it feels like every department tries to pass the buck. I’ve also packed and had pickers send damaged goods to the pack line so I know it’s not just inbound doing it.
stepparents,fekru9v,t3_epk41w,1579206297.0,"Ok so as someone who has actually done this custody arrangement (not by choice) let me tell you about my experience. I attended the same school for freshman and junior year and two different schools for sophomore and senior years. It was not that easy for either my social life or my academic life. I transferred schools in my sophomore year and the curriculum was very different even though it was literally one county over. In fact they tried to fail me in biology after I transferred even though I had a high A for the majority of the semester at my first school, just because they were in a different section when I moved. My senior year I transferred states and that was an eye opener. The standards are much higher in SC than they are in AL. I managed to get decent grades at all 3 schools when I applied myself. Socially it was a struggle. I went from having all of my friends from elementary on up with me until after freshman year. It was great because we were mostly involved in the same activities like marching band so I always had a friend or at least someone I was familiar with. They were also still there when I moved back my junior year and nothing really changed with them. My sophomore and senior year I joined sports to make friends. I don’t think I would have done that if I had stayed at my original school for all 4 years. I used to have terrible social anxiety so these acted as open doors for me to get to know people. I did however have a ton of “migraine days” in my sophomore year until I started to make friends at my new school. My senior year was much easier because I had already experienced moving schools. I also took on the mindset of it’s just one year and then I can get back to my friends. Through social media i did a pretty good job of staying in touch with my really good friends. I also was very much in touch with a boy that I started dating my sophomore year at my original school. Being young and “in love” didn’t make the transfers easy but I wasn’t really given a choice. I mention him because there’s a chance your SD will start dating and prefer to remain wherever her first sweetheart is. The boy thing is something that, as an adult, I feel held me back in terms of a social life and enjoying new experiences. My senior year went by pretty smoothly but I missed out on a lot by holding on to that one year mindset. I ended up getting a scholarship and attending college with several of my friends from my original school, close to the high school sweetheart. During my time at college I reconnected with several friends and ended up drifting apart from them. I’m sorry I wrote a novel but I wanted to tell you my experience of jumping between schools. It definitely has its pros and cons so I highly recommend that when the time comes, she sits down and writes out a list. Good luck to you.

ETA: when I came back to my original school for junior year, apparently the rumor mill had been quite busy. I supposedly had been pregnant and went away to give birth (what a Victorian mindset!!) when in reality my dad and stepmom had twins while I was at the different school. There were several other rumors that made me giggle but that was the biggest one, in was amazed because I was pretty open about my custody arrangement changing."

I appreciate her trying to help lessen the mess for the inevitable but it’s really damn annoying. She’s constantly trying to give my mother and myself a bunch of junk. Neither one of us has room for any of it and most of it is stuff that we’d never use. She’s actually gotten mad at us for not being able to accept things. Again, I really appreciate anything I can use and the fact that she’s taken this upon herself but it gets tiring to constantly remind her that I live in a small house that is already filled with my SO’s grandmothers things as well as my family of 5. I also don’t live close enough to gather things when she’d like. I would much rather see the things that she doesn’t need be donated to any of the number of charity organizations near her. She also likes to buy things to replace the things she’s given away."

We hold hands and generally wait at the back of the line but they stop and usher him on in front of them. They look out for the little ones at our stop, even if I’m right there. I encourage him to wait his turn but if they offer he needs to say thank you. Crazy shit happens when you attempt to raise your kids to be courteous.

I have someone willing to adopt my son but would like to wait a little longer so he can make the decision to be adopted.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,febdxx8,t1_febd8nw,1578957843.0,Luckily I found a great person and we’re raising our kids together now. It drove me insane for a while that people would either complain about themselves being a single parent while they shared custody equally or tried to point out that I was a single “woman” not a single “mom.” It’s been an amazing 4 years without his humans dad so honestly I wouldn’t have traded it for not being a single mom.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,feav9ar,t1_feagcs6,1578952510.0,My ex was the same way and has been completely gone for 4 years now.

YouShouldKnow,fdp3qo8,t1_fdp18of,1578619289.0,"Most of the opinions about the working conditions at amazon come from people who have never worked in a facility or worked for 3 days and couldn’t do it. It’s not a job for everyone. You’ll walk several miles a day and repetitive lifting up to 50lbs can take its toll on even the most in shape employees. It’s not a cake walk and it’s definitely not for everyone but it’s not the Dickins nightmare that everyone makes it out to be. Yes you have to make rate but generally it’s not too much of a problem as long as you don’t stand around and talk all day. Yes shits heavy but you kind of knew that when you applied. The biggest factor is management. If you have a good manager who looks out for you, it makes all the difference. And for god’s sake, nobody is pissing in a bottle.

ETA: you can downvote me if you like but a lot of people are grateful for their jobs at amazon. It’s not great but in some areas it is one of the best options. There will always be room for improvement in regards to the working conditions but it’s hardly the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory."

When I was pregnant with my son she claimed to have known about him before I told her and kept saying he had a pink aura around him so he was definitely a girl. Oh and that she saw a second aura so I was having twins no matter if I only heard one heartbeat and saw one baby on the ultrasound. She also claims my son is an empath and can remember his past life, all because he said something about remembering being born. All kids have an idea about how they’re born. He’s also extremely lacking empathy a lot of times, to the point where his doctor thinks he might be on the spectrum. But hey, she was a lion tamer in a former life so what do I know??"

Sometimes when we are old and very tired, our body just can’t handle it anymore and we die. That’s the gist of what we told my son when his great grandpa died. He accepted it and came up with the idea that his grandpa went to live on the moon so he can keep an eye on us. I’m sure at 8, she knows what death is and this could be a good introduction to the idea of losing something that she loves. I think you handled the body well and it was very sweet that you kept the toy from the cage. It might make her sad but just remind her that the hamster was very loved. When my hamster died my stepmom decided to call me and tell me about it in a very brusque manner. Granted I was almost 16 (it was the weekend of my birthday) and by the time I got to her house all of his affects and cage had been cleaned out and disposed of."
raisedbynarcissists,fc2txpw,t1_fc2e57i,1577373946.0,Sadly some strange people really believe that. My ex got really upset and refused to let me breastfeed my son because I was “too obsessed with it and it was really weirding him out.” He came in while I was trying to get my son to latch and accused me of smothering him. He insisted on using formula or making me pump with the simplest hand pump available. 6 months later a friend’s wife had a baby and he was weirdly obsessed with her breast feeding her baby. Kept telling me that we could try to get my milk supply back in and why didn’t I breastfeed like she did.
