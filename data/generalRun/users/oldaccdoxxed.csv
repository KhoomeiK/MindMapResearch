worldnews,fft21go,t3_ev0t32,1580202843.0,"*five million* people fled? Considering the short notice given and perception of the virus at the time I highly doubt this to be true. Plus, some of those ""fleeing"" probably would have left regardless for lunar new year. I doubt wuhan's population now is under 70% of its normal population."
HongKong,ffqm3ca,t3_euj9z3,1580138242.0,"To be fair there is a handful of cases overseas and thousands in China which is *one* country, so it makes sense. This of course can change at any moment, probably when there is hundred+ cases outside China."
HongKong,ffqlp99,t3_eum097,1580137957.0,"With the mask shortage all this’ll do is encourage people to reuse masks which defeats the purpose

Regardless masks are shown to slightly improve outcomes *in hospitals* when *used consistently*. General public’s use is likely more for mental assurance but it distracts from people who should focus more on handwashing."
GooglePixel,ffqi6yq,t3_eujrml,1580135293.0,"If you plan to go s10+ to P4xl to s20 whatever variant it’s probably better to stick it out until after s20 launches. Every transaction drops total value and it seems like a lot of work. Also only you know the value of battery life and ultrawide; if your s10+ is barely lasting the day then don’t switch, if it comfortably lasts through the day then the P4xl is probably a little tighter but still fine."
Android,ffqanwa,t1_ffpx84i,1580128411.0,"Considering tiny screen (halving screen diagonal=quartering screen area if aspect ratio is same), low res and weak chip it should do reasonably well."

apple,ffpy6cl,t3_eu8qy1,1580110567.0,"This is asking for alot and considering what ios 13 was like I'm not expecting all of this but:

- improved siri
- improved apple maps (especially in terms of reviews)
- default apps (let me dream)
- springboard change"
oddlysatisfying,ffp5qqc,t1_ffmkxh8,1580086923.0,Here (I’m assuming rich western country?) when people avoid ppe/osha they make a little extra. In poorer countries ppe/osha is the difference between feeding yourself and not feeding yourself. Context of economic situation is very important and reasonable standards in one place is not reasonable everywhere.
TikTokCringe,ffmjw0u,t1_ffmimuj,1580055712.0,"Doesn’t make sense to ban an app depending on whether they’re on duty or not as the app collects data any time. 

Regardless, it seems tiktok is only banned on government phones and I’m not sure how strictly that’s enforced (advisory by pentagon) and if this is a private phone then doesn’t matter either way."
oddlysatisfying,ffmjgiz,t1_ffmiuly,1580055525.0,IMO osha regulation and enforcement naturally follows wealth; when affording ppe means their work is simply not profitable it means price increase>demand decrease. The government has no incentive (and it would be very unpopular) to enforce osha if it takes away people’s livelihoods.
oddlysatisfying,ffmfzad,t1_ffm83s4,1580054161.0,Probably an issue with purchasing power. Already a relatively poor nation per capita + considering people most in need of PPE are those who are least able to afford it leads to this.
singapore,ffmcpxc,t1_ffljrcg,1580052470.0,"I wouldn’t be surprised if apple fronted it; they have enough money they can piss it out and here we are, talking about it, which is shaping brand image. They’ve spent huge amounts on architecture for no immediate gain plenty of times in the past too (just look at most Apple stores, especially fifth ave + their new HQ and Steve jobs theatre)"
PoliticalCompassMemes,fflcbt3,t1_ezsbflo,1580037778.0,"It's when you're in a global recession and you stimulate the econony by taking money away from the economy through cutting welfare except oh fuck it causes your country to be the slowest recovering economy in the West and takes out tens of thousands of people because suicide, welfare and healthcare."

China,ffezz3t,t1_ffezj18,1579871799.0,Yes pretty much. People in this country keep voting for it because media is controlled by a few conservative billionaires. Anyways I wouldn’t base my view of any country because their quarantine equipment had windows but clearly you seem to think it’s appropriate and we’ll have to agree to disagree.
China,ffeyz47,t1_ffeyngf,1579870880.0,"Idk in my country, which is Australia, I'm almost certain a suspected case will be taken out in a *clear* isopod through the quickest path possible rather than some long detour to satisfy your superior moral standards. After all making sure no one sees this person's face (which isn't possible in this case either way) is more important than delivering medical care as quickly as possible. I understand t_d got quarantined but I suggest r/conspiracy rather than this sub to waste your time on."
China,ffexpif,t1_ffexjra,1579869657.0,How else are you going to get a person who is in the airport to a place that is not the airport but to move them through the airport? You're reading way too far into this. It's a good thing to have specialised equipment  for containment rather than a collapsible pod on top of a stretcher.
China,ffewx5w,t1_ffewsbn,1579868853.0,Have you not seen those ISO-PODs and similar mobile quarantine equipment? Don't walk around like every patient should be wearing masks in the hospital to satisfy HIPAA or something.
China,ffeo5cs,t1_ffem9y7,1579856890.0,Wow I own a piece of clothing that's made in China!
China,ffe6xav,t1_ffdvr00,1579838322.0,"I don’t think koalas are edible for humans due to their diet, or at least it would be very unpalatable."
Android,ffe6pgr,t1_ffe31s2,1579838154.0,Still if they just used current s10 line as next year's budget they could avoid hardware costs *and* reduce software costs (s10/note 10 support extension rather than support for more devices)
China,ffdzsg8,t1_ffc55uk,1579833024.0,"Maybe they just wanted windows tho. You know, for medical professionals to see them and whatnot. Crazy theory but I'm just putting it out there."
China,ffdyv0o,t3_esvqe3,1579832350.0,"I agree with the answer of C rather than A but the fucking prompt is way too unnatural (how hard you are working, Helen!)"
