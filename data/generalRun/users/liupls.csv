Ok let me just say this, fuck the people who can't be bothered with you. Please love, the only way you're gonna see some positivity in this is if you learn to strut your walk. Spread love not hate lmaoo. You know you're strong and you know you're really tough for enduring so much both at home and out in school. Friends are important but only real friends matter. Don't be in a rush to find friends and lose yourself in your desperation for them. Sometimes we just need to grow comfortable with the way we express ourselves and people will naturally gravitate to us. (I think) Fake friends don't mean shit because they could cause havoc in your life and make you more miserable down the road. Can I say this? No matter what, just look ahead and don't be afraid of what hasn't even started. You don't know the people you're going to be conversing with and you never know, you might just find some gems this year. You'll be fine love. You're worthy of your own company!!! Please don't be too anxious or upset over this yea I know it's tough because we don't want to look like loners but really, just go forward without thinking too much about it.

relationship_advice,fdn59u4,t3_em9ovp,1578577665.0,"Hm. I have many guy friends who hype me up too. The only problem here is the fact that he is attached to someone who isn't comfortable with this. I always hype my guy friends up and it comes from a place of pure platonic intent. Like, I really just love the sis dude vibe. I live for it in my friendships and it don't matter if it's the opposite gender bc I have no romantic intent towards them anyway... For your case, I'd say that you really need to ask him to imagine you in his shoes. And tell him, the only reason why he gets so possessive over you is due to him projecting the intention behind his actions to 'hype up' these friends of his, onto you. For example, I don't mind when my guy goes to clubs or bars or whatever because I know that when I go to clubs or bars I go for fun and not for the guys so the idea of him betraying me doesn't even cross my mind. Get it? I just feel like he does not respect your relationship - or you ,enough. Just ask him to imagine you in his place with these other guys. I doubt he would approve lol. Also, why does he require the validation and company of other girls (and only specifically GIRLS) when he already has a girlfriend?? Does he actively publicize himself in a girl's company on social media????? I don't get it. Ask him to wake up his idea. It ain't going to work out if he ain't gonna listen to you and work out the problems behind his actions. Probably comes from insecurity or fear of being lonely when the gf is out enjoying company with friends. Maybe he craves more emotional validation from you. But if he is using these girls for an emotional high because he gets off conversing with someone new,,,, throw outta the window. You know him better than I do so please consider his potential need for more attention from you and the fear of being left behind in the dust as you move forward in life haha. All the best girly!!!"

relationship_advice,fdn2ga5,t3_em943d,1578575285.0,"NOOOOOOOOO. My love, you aren't over reacting. Really. I've been in your situation a year ago when my date complimented everybody except me, pointed out my flaws, asked me to exercise and lose weight blahblah even after knowing about my past with anorexia. haha. It was quite a tragedy and I hated it because I always felt like he was trying to make me compete for his approval. Bull fucking shit. Nobody has to chase the other for validation - especially when it comes to our appearances!! Girl, please do not allow yourself to sink to his level by commenting on other guys too. You'll be doing yourself a dishonor lmao just leave this guy. I don't get it, this should be basic courtesy. And he continued it after you expressed discomfort which is completely unacceptable imo. You don't just sit there spouting insults without doing anything to help the person better himself. Ugh. He is wasting your time. You can so obviously find someone out there more appreciative of you as a person.

Actually, you could try to work things out with him by telling him that you are tired of his insecurity-projecting ass. Ask him what is the point behind him commenting about other girls and ask him what the hell he actually derives from expressing these sentiments. Every action is based on reason. That's what differentiates humans from animals lol. If he stutters and turns defensive, tell him that the only effect is the hurt this causes you. And it don't matter whether or not he realizes this. The point is, if he wants to stay with you - he needs to accept that his actions have an effect on your emotions and that this makes up the very foundation of a relationship. If he is unable to compromise on this small thing, it is difficult to compromise on other stuff in the future. Also, his unwillingness to compromise simply means that he prioritizes his free expression over your feelings of hurt. Big nono. Please consider this and make a decision dearie, don't be too down in the dumps over this guy. Ask him to suck it up or he gtg. Sending love sweetheart, stay confident!! :)"
dating,fdn12be,t3_em4siz,1578574001.0,"Personally, I think texting everyday is completely fine and I actually find it a little off when I fail to text the person I'm dating. I also think hanging out as soon as possible is fine???? I would prefer someone more forward because I'm so damn scared of initiating stuff like I'm overstepping my boundaries or something. I think complements are completely natural my friends and I kiss hug and complement one another everytime we see each other so I guess you will have to find someone who relates to this and likes words of affirmation? (Provided they are truly from your heart). Tbh, as someone with issues with her appearance, my friends' genuine compliments (oohing and ahhing) have helped me improve so much with regards to my self esteem. So, I think that should be safe too. I just don't understand why you have to change the way you express your admiration for them just so you come off as a 'cooler' guy. It gets really tiring after awhile. So you should seriously just do your thing and rock it!! haha as funny as that sounds. I wouldn't want the guy I'm seeing to have so many restrictions or restraints when he's with me because I'd feel a little crazy......like I'm the only one interested maybe.. 

Your tendency to 'come off as desperate' is not a thing. Really. Needy and desperation are completely different things. Desperate carries a negative connotation and what you mentioned doesn't seem to hint at that. Neediness differs between individuals. I'd say I tend to become needy too during a relationship but I scare myself into withdrawing to hide being vulnerable for someone lmaooo I would want to be like you. Please continue being you, happy dating!! :D"

Or if you wouldn't mind flowery elements inside, I was thinking you could try branching out the 2 branches in the middle into multiple smaller stalks so the bee looks surrounded by a field of flowers.

I'm also a really extroverted person, I find it really easy to make friends. I have been through a phase like yours before and that was when I was searching for validation in everyone when I couldn't find it in myself. You should allow yourself to find peace, discover who you really are and your self-identity. Don't let others define you. Don't let how others treat you define you. You define yourself. I know it's tough.

offmychest,fdaa246,t3_ekffsi,1578243504.0,"Love, you can't get rid of anger. You can't replace anger. You have to let go of it. Stop clinging onto it because it makes you feel and act. Your love hate relationship with anger is the reason why you're unable to move on sweetheart. If you need someone to talk to or just someone to listen, I'm always here. If you need small talk or just stupid chattering I'm here for ya. All the best mate :)"
dating_advice,fda2748,t3_ekepdv,1578240799.0,"Yep same. I think getting into a relationship takes a looooooong ass time for me because I need an actual emotional connection with the person. So everything before that is probably friendship and dating. Actually, I don't even like to label the 'dating' stage. But the conversation should take place when the both of you have established a true connection and are willing to give your all. That's my take.

Of course, exclusive or non-exclusive talk should take place when things start to get intimate. (Don't mean relationship though)"

sad,fda155v,t3_ekeptg,1578240472.0,It's cool bro. I feel this on a spiritual level. It's tiring but it's true that loyal friends do come by and they last for a lifetime. Drama-free friendships are real after knowing each other's ins and outs. :)
dating_advice,fda0fkv,t3_ekerks,1578240286.0,"How did you confess? She didn't reject you immediately? Did she say she needed space? 

Hmm, I think you should wait for her to come on to you. I mean as a female, I would never ask for space to consider. It's literally yes/no. I wouldn't want to lead people on. If she has specified that she needed space to consider then you should give her the space she needs and wait for her reply?"
books,fd9zc11,t3_ekebs9,1578239835.0,"This is so informative and cool. I hope this helps people out there!!! Thanks bud, so kind of you to do this :)))"
teenagers,fd9ycvm,t3_ekeckm,1578239540.0,"I'm proud of you too!!!! The first step is always the hardest because we all love living in denial (oop). *Hug* 

Parents-wise I think you could say that you're trying to improve yourself and to see if counselling actually works for you. If it doesn't then that's too bad. Tell them that you're trying and you're going to give it a go. (But really, when you're at the bottom the only way you can go is up haha). I know parents can be really stubborn and refuse to believe in mental health due to social stigma but the only way you can prove to them is by showing improvements and getting better as a person. They will never ever believe simple words. By saying that you're 'giving it a go' shows that you aren't forcing your ideas down their throats. It's like subtle yielding, does this make sense?"
relationship_advice,fd9vxtl,t3_ekeebp,1578238719.0,"Move on bro. I'm glad you're trying to get over her. 

Get busy, unfollow her on all social media platforms. Just undo everything that reminds you of her."
spotify,fd9vdth,t3_ekeemb,1578238480.0,OOF crywolf!!
lonely,fd9sfs9,t1_fd9ouwb,1578237505.0,"Yea, this. Just know that you're actually pursuing a genuine friendship and not using her as a replacement for someone else. Well, I know people who slide into IG dms and people who use dating apps. Kinda tough to find a real connection though. All the best, I hope you find the friendship you need :)"
Crushes,fd9rq8j,t3_ekdyq3,1578237151.0,Yep. When I want to get over him or when I'm tired of creating my own emotional roller coaster over someone who doesn't even know me lmaoooo
Advice,fd9qsy7,t3_eke1vd,1578236862.0,Can I just say this. No love will ever be the same as your first.
TrueOffMyChest,fd9qg4b,t3_eke0zf,1578236672.0,I third this. I hope it was smooth
ESFP,fd9pv0y,t1_f8txqtb,1578236540.0,This!!! I trust everyone so I can come off as shallow. But trust means I trust you wholeheartedly and I'll believe that you have good intentions and all that. Trust is very difficult when it comes to showing emotions or being vulnerable though.
ESFP,fd9o0ad,t1_fcxaovk,1578235922.0,"Nahhh. I think ESFPs enjoy talking about anything and everything. We genuinely do like small talk and deeper conversations because we are curious people. No we aren't entertaining you. It's really easy to know when we are actually entertaining people because we don't make the effort to even look or sound interested lmao. No energy for that. I can't deal with superficial talk just to make sure someone likes me or something. Very tiring. So if an ESFP genuinely tries to help and listen to you talk, you can be sure that he/she is actually making the effort to form a deeper connection with you.

And ya. Because we have so many friends,,, we tend to be the ones getting invited and not the other way round. We are kinda spoilt... and we're sorry for that... I think us ESFPs are also afraid of rejection or intruding on other people's personal time so we don't attempt to ask people out. But when people reach out to us, it shows that the person actually needs our company. We don't like coming across as annoying so we don't try to excessively reach out to others? I hope this made sense haha.  And we do value quality time with friends or people we care for so we make sure to stick to the date."
ESFP,fd9lp5l,t1_fcvy0nv,1578235047.0,Same. Feel this. My first instinct when I feel vulnerable is to run away or seek shelter haha. It's a very very big problem.
