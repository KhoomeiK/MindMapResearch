Celiac,ffr5rfe,t1_ffqwoad,1580151057.0,I saw that study. Makes me wonder is this is more common.
New_World_MMO,fffh4hu,t3_etcrbs,1579883838.0,I would make a weekly megathread. We do not get enough information from AGS as of right now to have daily threads.
New_World_MMO,ff6hlpg,t1_ff6f267,1579627374.0,99%? Can you prove that?
New_World_MMO,ff6doyj,t1_ff6dn3o,1579624948.0,"Okay, bud."
New_World_MMO,ff6dknq,t1_ff6dgd4,1579624873.0,"For fucks sake. If you're going to pit players against one another and imply one is the ""real"" one, leave this community."
New_World_MMO,ff6d73t,t3_erogup,1579624636.0,Wtf is that title?
New_World_MMO,ff69d2q,t1_ff693ms,1579622185.0,"Dude, I was an alpha player LOL. I know what they are saying. Most of them are waiting to see how they changes actually play out."
New_World_MMO,ff67zru,t1_ff67ofh,1579621296.0,"I do not want these changes.

But, pretending that almost everyone hates these changes is ignorant."
New_World_MMO,ff65j0i,t3_ervtmi,1579619635.0,People who are upset will be more vocal than those who like the changes.
New_World_MMO,ff4ts9n,t1_ff4laqe,1579572267.0,"I played alpha, saw and experienced the problems other players complained about. Yes, Amazon addressed those problems. As to whether or not they fixed them is yet to be seen. That is where the constant complaining in the community becomes my issue. We do not know what the game 100% like, so saying the game is DOA is idiotic. We have to just wait.

I do not have an opinion on the changes being changed. They could keep them or revert it back. I really do not care. I would just like my company to stay together, and I know they would like the old one. So either way, no opinion.

Do YOU have statistics on the majority? Because Amazon claims a lot of alpha players complained. Based on what I saw and heard in alpha, I believe it."
New_World_MMO,ff3laa1,t1_ff3jh3u,1579543461.0,"That is alpha, my dude. The game is not just going to release how it was during alpha lol."
New_World_MMO,ff3kupy,t1_ff3er4x,1579543195.0,Show me some statistics that the alpha players who complained were the small minority.
New_World_MMO,ff3krxi,t1_ff3e27o,1579543148.0,">carebear

>stupid baby games

This is exactly what I'm talking about."
New_World_MMO,ff3kj8j,t1_ff3k473,1579543000.0,"I played alpha. I was in the forums, discords, group chats, etc. There are multiple groups of players who do not engage in discussions and instead give feedback through the player feedback option in game.

It is not that hard to believe that the people unhappy with these changes will rage on social media platforms, while those neutral or happy will say nothing.

You do not have statistics and neither do I, but do not pretend that reddit represents everyone."
New_World_MMO,ff39eve,t1_ff395p4,1579536789.0,"We have no idea what they had behind the scenes before, during, and immediately after alpha.

Stop speculating what a team of developers can and cannot do."
New_World_MMO,ff39bn6,t1_ff38lku,1579536732.0,"Everything you are arguing is all speculation as there is not much public information out.

If you are this upset about a game that is still in development, you have not even gotten to play this version yet, etc....Dude, step away."
New_World_MMO,ff2uxsa,t1_ff2ooza,1579525157.0,">This game doesn't have that

How do you know? How do any of us know? The game we played in alpha is not the game being released."
New_World_MMO,ff2607f,t1_ff25va7,1579494777.0,"You have yet to see how different this game is in game form.

You're failing to realize that you're proving my point. You feel entitled to YOUR version of the game by saying, ""it is a slap in the face"".

I also played alpha, I also gave feedback. Does my opinion not matter simply because you wanted your dream mmo?"
New_World_MMO,ff24saf,t1_ff24gso,1579493802.0,"And it might still be the next big pvp mmo? Just might not have EVERYTHING you wanted. There will not be a perfect pvp mmo that fits into your perfect mold.

They gave players access to alpha, alpha players complained about certain pvp aspects, they changed those aspects.

Acting like you are the only people to play the game and deserve that version IS entitlement."
New_World_MMO,ff24ibj,t1_ff23bce,1579493581.0,"The mods are not responsible for it, in my opinion. The community itself needs to realize that they are r/notlikeothergirls in the sense that there are plenty of other type of players in the world. They are not Amazon's main focus.

Having the mentality that you are entitled to anything is just not healthy. I know that is saying a lot; that a community needs to take ownership, but just calling others out on their shitty outlook on the game can do a lot.

Just take the game as is or don't play it."
New_World_MMO,ff22r4i,t1_ff22nrn,1579492221.0,"Sorry, you feel that way. I see no difference between the two."
New_World_MMO,ff22i9s,t1_ff22b87,1579492034.0,"r/newworldgame is not any better. It is the community as a whole, not one specific place."
New_World_MMO,ff1yhlj,t1_ff1eh9z,1579489098.0,"Good god, you guys act like you are entitled to this game when there are thousands of other gamers who play this game and enjoy it without you.

Games hardly ever release the same as they were when they started development. This is not a hard concept."
New_World_MMO,ff1y6yr,t3_eqy4ad,1579488895.0,"\>God damn right as amazon took the only thing we followed and wanted.  

Amazon took what alpha players gave them during feedback and listened. As an alpha player, I can confirm that being killed early and repeatedly was a problem. I complained about and so did many others, even though I was in a pvp focused company.

If you are admitting to being toxic, log off and step away from the computer. No video game is worth turning yourself into that.

All this, ""pvp vs pve"" and ""carebear wah wah wah"" bullshit is getting old. It's a video game and Amazon can change THEIR game to suit their wants. I'm seeing more and more pve support, maybe you guys need to realize you're being the very vocal minority?"
spacex,feohrrl,t3_eq24ap,1579300411.0,"For the Falcon Heavy we went to Jetty Park and it was absolutely nuts, but that was an afternoon launch.

We plan on leaving Orlando around 5am and heading there. Anyone else have any suggestions?"

orlando,fehmz1d,t1_fehjkcg,1579119821.0,"Honestly, I'm not sure. I go out there for fun and it can take 45-60 minutes to get out there. 

I would just look at places who are hiring for your degree and google the company and see if they have a decentish credibility."
orlando,fehj32m,t3_ep5fw3,1579117569.0,"I work in manufacturing and we work with the companies you listed. They are constantly going through employees, I'm not sure you want to work there anyways.

Look at smaller companies in the area, especially the space coast if you do not mind the drive."
news,feheoet,t1_fehdq40,1579114989.0,Can you tell me how she is showing zero remorse?
news,feh35dm,t1_feh2u29,1579108172.0,"People like that truly do not research our justice system and how it helps prisoners. Being in jail means you are separated from society. Good behavior gets you rewards. Good behavior will get you a better chance for a normal life afterwards.

You cannot just expect people to be in jail, isolated from the world and then return then to society just as you took then from it. You HAVE to help them, otherwise they will just reoffend.

Our society can be really cruel and unforgiving. Especially in this case where Michelle was clearly very mentally unstable. She needed therapy."
news,feh1wg9,t3_ep38hc,1579107423.0,"I get that we all think she is a vile human being, but are the programs not there to help prisoners? Are we really going to advocate that we should not encourage progress, no matter the being?

It is kind of like the Venables and Thompson case. If you're angry for how the system treats and helps these prisoners to prepare them for when they get released, your anger is misplaced. Be angry they were not locked up for longer.

Overall, if Michelle is showing remorse, guilt, etc and has been doing everything asked of her, why should she not be released after serving?"
news,fegs0iq,t1_fegn290,1579101185.0,"This. The amount of times I order Amazon's Choice and the seller always sends a card asking for a review for a free product? Shit, no wonder you are the choice lol."
New_World_MMO,fegj1o3,t1_fegh2sk,1579094286.0,"Played in alpha, this is what combat and the game looked like. They probably had a spectator camera filming this."
aww,feefme0,t3_eonffw,1579032765.0,"I have never wanted kids of my own. I have so many diseases that I will genetically give to a child and I cannot, will not, give them those.

If my Husband and I ever decide to have children, we will definitely adopt. I wish more people knew how achievable it is. I have always heard that it is so expensive, but when you truly look into it, it really isn't.

Beat of luck to you."
aww,feadz2u,t1_feac6oo,1578947434.0,"I'm sure the owner loves their dog very much, but this video kind of frustrates me.

It is very much like the baby videos you see with the dog very clearly showing signs of being uncomfortable. And the owner always swears nothing will happen, they're the sweetest dog, they will let me know, etc etc.

And then it does happen because the dog WAS letting you know.

This video is a really good example of that and multiple people here are saying the entire instagram is like this. This poor dog clearly does not like these situations and is being used for views. 

I love my cat so much and wish she would get along with everyone, but I am not going to drag her out from under the table so she can please people.

Edit: scrolling through the instagram profile, I do not see many videos like this, but this video still frustrates me."
