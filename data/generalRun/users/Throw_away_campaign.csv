PresidentBloomberg,ffrbvd2,t1_ffr9vs8,1580154830.0,"I think progressives were more split between Bernie and Warren, but Warren's attempt to paint Bernie as a sexist and refusing to shake his hand after the debate ultimately cost her.

&#x200B;

Even when people are splitting their votes, they want positivity and respect a pro-blue anti-trump message.  As candidates drop out from disappointing results, their voters will choose a different candidate to back.

There's zero chance Bloomberg drops before Super Tuesday since he's not on the early primary state tickets, but it's possible he'll pick up a lot of voters if others drop out.

Here's a video from the Hill where they basically say the same thing and say Bernie's success is good for Bloomberg if it causes other candidates to drop early:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFMlxMgfTDM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFMlxMgfTDM)"

Hillary historically underestimated Trump and tried to prop him up in the primaries.  She told the news to take Trump seriously as a candidate.

 [https://knockhundred.com/news/difference-between-simplified-and-traditional-chinese-subtitles](https://knockhundred.com/news/difference-between-simplified-and-traditional-chinese-subtitles)   


It sounds like either you are selecting the wrong version of Chinese for you, or only have one option on shows you like, or possibly that they are being cheap and using some auto-translate to just swap between simplified/traditional character sets without understanding that a particular symbol can have opposite meaning to someone in one part of the Chinese speaking world to another."

So the best bet would be to ask permission to create your own profile and that might satisfy her.  Not all profiles can stream at the same time on the cheapest option.  It might be only 1 screen on the cheapest option, but having your own profile might satisfy her concern about multiple people being in the same profile.
