aspergers,fffv805,t3_eta1b4,1579892521.0,"I described this anxiety in the form of that Robert Frost quote with taking the path least travelled and that having made all the difference. I'm standing at the fork and desperately try to look down the pathway of both because the anxiety of choice makes it such that I would prefer the path that's less perilous and that's not always the more trodden direction. There's no real way to future proof though and that just renders me impotent in the face of making a decision because I suffer what I call decision revision. In all honesty though, I can't even commit to that as that requires an earnest attempt at something. Fear feels as though it's prevented that.

There's also been that time vacuum effect described by /u/sateliteconstelation. I think that comes from a desperation to hold onto a moment for control and anxiety in the realm of memory. The passage of time starts to make a conversation feel unreal. I'll walk out of therapy in a haze sometimes and try to recollect the hour but it just feels like it didn't happen.

These places need patient advocates or an aide that will go through the possible drawbacks of a procedure. It shouldn't be up to you to find out whether a procedure is safe to undergo or the relative risks.

Maybe the first step is to try and reconnect with a family member, let him or her know your experience and then that person can help you navigate treatment plans with your next therapist and psychiatrist. There's no shame in getting help at each stage as you need it. This life shit is hard.

I would do it for everyone if I could but limited hours and my own experience is limited too. We know some fashion of what another sufferer of AvPD goes through. That measure of familiarity hopefully engenders empathy and a desire to connect and to see each other succeed. I'm sorry I can't think of more to say for you to possibly do."
AvPD,ff57tlq,t3_ero1ch,1579582766.0,"I've had family that got ECT to try and fight treatment resistant depression but I wasn't aware it was a treatment course that was considered for AvPD. I can't begin to imagine what that feels like on top of the depression and AvPD. If things have reached such severity according to your psychiatrists, have they ever considered transcranial magnetic stimulation or treatments with ketamine? I'm not sure how they would mesh in light of the ECT already administered but to my knowledge, both of those are less invasive than what you've already had done.

The family member I have who had the ECT did not react well to it either and gets blank spots at times. It seemed after he had it done that his personality changed and not for the better. Quicker to anger. We were told it's not done like it used to be and that it was still an effective course to pursue. I'm really doubting the veracity of those claims.

Asexual,ff4ob8i,t3_erl8er,1579568481.0,"Point him to childfree. There are plenty of people who don't care and really don't want to reproduce for whatever reason, to the degree that they will voluntarily sterilize themselves because their convictions or desires are that strong. There are gay people who will never think of acquiring help from a surrogate to bear a child or children for them. There are people who live entire lives only pursuing sex for the release and not for anything more, no desire for a partnered relationship.

If all of these permutations of the human experience and more that I haven't conceived can exist, what precludes the possibility that asexuals can be found in the ranks of humanity. It exists in the animal kingdom (though you open yourself up to lame jokes about reproduction and what not) therefore it exists in nature. 

Now, the idea that we can't get laid. As in any population, there will be a percentage for which that's true. Since he's denying the possibility of aces existing altogether though, it would be pointless probably to concede that. Nor will be accept that the inclination to do so is inherently contrary to the majority of asexuals. I feel comfortable saying that as the repulsed, averse and neutral are, to varying degrees, going to refuse or be indifferent to any opportunities. 

The sex positive may do so because they are partnered but might otherwise have no intrinsic desire to do so under their own steam. I'll confess that those that are positive and enthusiastic are an enigma to me but we all have something to learn.

One could make an equal claim that there will be people who have no interest in furthering their own DNA line but find the outlet of perpetuating the species or the tribe by direct investiture of time, resources and affection to those explicitly not of their blood and this is certainly the case with adoption. Biology is a compelling series of links but it's not a leash."

Instead, I've poured a lot of energy into different internet portals here and the trade-off doesn't seem to be equivalent. I seem to temporarily have misplaced the ability to self-soothe or engage in aspirational dreaming. 

You're not garbage. Your neurochemistry is screwed up right now and you're in a bad way. The inciting incident that has derailed your feeling of progress is a concrete thing that seems to be the catalyst. So what can you or I do but look at these obstacles and try to overcome them. Break them into chunks, smaller goals. 

Think to the past for a little while but not too long. Don't sink into a nostalgia hole. Just try and pry up memories where you thought of who you'd be. Is that still who you want to be? If not, who is that person? We know who we don't want to be and that's our current selves. But really, it's a collection of positive identifiers or traits we want to assemble and not the negative that come easily because our bent brains deliver them to us.

Shit is tough. I feel like a fraud writing all this except for one thing: I don't like the alternative. The alternative is to keep sinking and I don't know if I can afford that. So we push. You and I.

I can get that. The sounds get to me sometimes even in regular movies. Exaggerated, sloppy. When you're in the moment, presumably, you're not picking up on all these external stimuli being produced.

Asexual,ff1ytgb,t1_ff1xwip,1579489327.0,"Verisimilitude is the suspension of disbelief. So, when you're watching a Marvel movie, you're not constantly thinking that all the backgrounds and Hulk is CG imagery. You're swept up in the illusion that the filmmakers have produced in rendering the visuals. Same with simulated sex. You'll often hear something like, ""She's clearly grinding on his stomach,"" or words to that effect by people who wish films were more graphic. And I'm sorry if I've been too graphic myself.

Real McCoy is another way of saying the real thing. It's slang, I guess. Skeeves is gross but not as extreme. I'll bounce back from being skeeved out but being grossed out will take longer.

The dreams are nourishing or they offer a direction cause they're also goals. Mentioned below, I have a dependency issue that I'm surprised wasn't formalized into a disorder diagnosis.

I'm a year and a half in. This is the longest I've ever gone. Usually I split after two months but it's a luxury to do that. I'm older. I don't want to be this way. I have to figure out how to control it.

AvPD,fea5djq,t3_eo76q9,1578944553.0,"Without a formal diagnosis, one can't be sure but you know the story of your life. The best advice I can offer is to continue to read up as you can and match symptoms or traits of AvPD to those you associate with yourself. There are some avoidance traits that ring out to me like black and white thinking: ""Looking for therapy but want it to be just right."" We don't like taking risks if there's a possibility of something unexpected or displeasing that is a potential outcome. Avoidance is used to mitigate pain at the expectation that joy or positivity is less likely. 

Unless your potential therapist really turns out to be a dud on intake, you'll likely have to stifle and stuff some instincts deep down and open up. I went at least once a week to start, dropped to two times a month and now I'm getting back to weekly. It takes work to try and get better. I hope you don't take this as criticism. This is just a friendly reminder that it will be tough.

The only advice I can offer is to ignore your first impulse because rapport with a therapist takes time to build. It took me a few attempts before I found people that worked for me. I also wanted to do the work this time. You can think you want to but don't with preconceived notions of how it won't work. It's difficult to admit our own ability to judge is faulty, to start. 

Therapists are people too though. If he or she seems disinterested or hostile, you'll know. Just try to balance doubting first impressions with your experiences cause that's hard won knowledge.

I've only ever experienced ideation so I can't say how sorry I am you had something happen that led to an attempt. Are you sure you even want the half friendship with her? I'd think about that while embarking on the therapy.

Were you living with her or do you think you could find a way to get that residence back?"
AvPD,fdcjy9e,t1_fdcie7z,1578276765.0,"Yeah, I get that. Was just hoping that with some conversation it could turn a little for you. 

Are there confrontations that you expect to need to make because of traditional masculinity? Like if you're confronted physically? How much do your circumstances affect it. Are they wrapped in as a preoccupation? My family just lost half the income we had coming in so there's that as a new stressor.

If you can find someone to trust with it in your life, it's worth it. The thoughts have to come out, whether with a person or in a diary and then ripping it up for some shallow catharsis. It's in the same vein as depression where the culture is oversaturated with the term and it loses meaning and impact. But you know for yourself that it's not a passing thing.

One on one therapy and trying to find means of exposure is my current plan along with group for an unrelated thing. Because the fear often arises from no frame of reference or acclamation to a given task or stimuli.

If you had to go on roller coasters and you hated roller coasters, no amount of talking about it can give you the tools to overcome that. It's taking the ride and feeling the fear. And repetition. Our troubles take longer to overcome imo because the nature of the disorder fights the attempt for any treatment or specific cure of an isolated fear. 

It could be worse though. You could believe this is normal. If you're closer on the schizoaffective scale, that can happen and feelings become either blunted or if it's full blown, you can be in a whole other world. I hate relativism as a general rule but it can help occasionally for perspective. 

This is something that can be lived with. It's just an extra effort needed."
AvPD,fdcgp4i,t3_ekitqn,1578274458.0,"AvPD is different than maybe not liking to make speeches or some isolated activity. It usually pervades every aspect of socialization. Anxiety spent its time lifting and making gains. It has a permanent flexed muscle ready to strangle you. 

A fun habit I have that friends have made fun of me for on occasion is to exit cars last, walk stairs last, sit in as close to a corner as possible when given a choice. All hypervigilant actions for events that will never take place. 

It's fear. Anyone with empathy should be taken aback at someone saying, ""I'm scared and I don't really know why and I can't seem to control it."" And that's a reality for a lot of people with this.

This might be coming on stronger than necessary. Just have stuff going on. Unfortunately, class affects treatment near directly. Your family are probably scared for you cause it's hard to find support in this life beyond your own person. Hopefully you can explain it to them.

That's another milestone that, while difficult and probably not working as well as it does for others in your unit, is an important one.

The hardest thing in my mind with this disorder is choosing a path because we're so afraid of making the wrong choice. Analysis paralysis just eventually leads to standing still, imagining both paths. And adding a second person to that with a relationship seems perilous no matter how lonely. 

A lot of changes at once can lead to failure. The working on one solid goal, imo, is the best approach. Getting the diagnosis can help but if you really believe you have it, it won't hurt to strategize around it so long as you can keep in perspective that it's not formal and also, even if or when it's formalized, you can't give in.
