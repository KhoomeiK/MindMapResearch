marketing,fgskvxe,t3_f0a6v2,1581086873.0,"Paid search/social growth are 2 different skill sets. Paid tends to be very analytical while social is more creative. You can find generalist but ones that are strong in both aren't common.

Consider putting paid to a freelancer/agency. Bring the social person in house.

Many reasons but the main 2;

- Paid is more analytical. You dont need to understand the company at the same level of detail to be successful so if this person isnt around all the time its fine. Also its hard to stay fresh with PPC years on end so its good to change people more regularly than you would other roles. Id consider myself fairly good at PPC but I notice I get stale after being on an account for too long. I sometimes pay for consultants to come look at my accounts just to freshen them up every so often, challenge where I could be doing better and keep me on my toes etc.

- Social: You need someone that knows the company and knows the community intimately. You can pay agencies for social but the 'X-post' packages etc tend to be a bit stale. Also with social you want people responding to things fast, not juggling 5 client priorities. Getting the right person in house is better IMO but if they aren't working fire fast. People either get social or they dont. Also people sometimes suit one companies social style but not another. If someone is weak I dont think they can be trained up much."

From my small bubble I got the feeling many republican supporters get good healthcare because they DO work and have private care. And are worried that they will be personally worse off under universal system because all the people you mention will now be at the same hospital/doctors etc as they go. 

I think to understand this problem there are people as you say but 
 there isn't enough recognition that there is also a huge chunk of intelligent and reasonable people that are simply trying to protect what they work hard for and receive today, and general fear of the unknown especially when it comes to government, which seems reasonable.

My view is a better approach than to call people who dont want universal care, rabble that dont know better, is to show good systems like Australia/NHS etc where everyone gets great care, outcome and still allows for private health upgrades should people want that for more choice or faster times to receive non-essential care etc.

AusFinance,fgfcchl,t3_ey0g6m,1580734272.0,"Its funny how the quote the ""Grattan’s 2018 report, Money in retirement: more than enough"" as we have enough savings.

The reason we have good retirement savings is largely because of super! https://grattan.edu.au/report/no-free-lunch/

My drill down;

1) The real reason LNP want to scrap the super increase is it will cost their budget significantly as tax dollars go into the super category where they see less of it. 

2) Because many people today have reasonable retirement income to survive on, doesn't mean we shouldn't be increasing this. They pitch it as dont take my 'personal choice' but the reality is much (most?) people wont save sufficiently unless encouraged. Then future government 20 years on will pick up the tab, and more people will be on the breadline of the pension.

3) Comparing retires today to 30 years away inst fair largely as most older generation own a house. Many of the next generation will be renting in retirement which will add a significant cost burden not seen today.

Obviously a bunch more too it but I feel this is largely about point 1 and LNP shooting for short term 'balance the budget' wins."

- I'm a prepper lite, so topped up food so have 2-3 months vs 1-2 normally. I don't really plan how to store food but basically bulk buy half price or better specials for things that store well as I figure in an emergency I'll eat anything and I get half price cans/jar food we normally use most of the year rather than the week it's on special.

Overall I assume there is limited risk for developed nations. Wait and watch, if it seems to be growing rapidly/dangerously I'll WFH for a while and watch news updates. 

Consider, even current worst case scenario of 20% death rate widely spread across a country, that would be the great tragedy of our generation but won't shut a country down directly. I think risk is short term panic, e.g. combination of panic buying of goods if virus does spread plus not wanting to go to crowded supermarkets if it is getting common so worth being ahead on that or economic downturn from borders closing etc. But really humans are amazingly resilient in dealing with problems when they become a focus."

People are complaining about this system at the moment because Trump but it's been set up on strong principles and logic and works well because the flip side in its simplest is many states will feel they get rail roaded by larger states and want to exist.
