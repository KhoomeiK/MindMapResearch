However, when you type that share code (GP6M+WJ Les Haies) into Maps, it puts you down pretty close to where the place seemed to be.

While you could plug them with whatever you want, you'd have to remove it every time you want to take the side panel off.

Some kind of a gasket around the edge could work, as explained by other users. You could probably glue the gasket into the top panel, as long as the gasket isn't too thick, and the top panel can still slot in properly."

As you can read from the Wikipedia page you linked, 99,7% of people suffered no permanent damage from getting tazed. Even then, I'd GUESS most of the injuries caused by taser use were related to the perp face planting into the curb. Not from the electric shock damaging their brain."

I was thinking about it from the other person's perspective:

1. Video talks about what an electric shock does to your body

As for smartphones, use what you prefer. I personally use the most vivid option, since I don't like the washed-out look and I like how the UI elements pop with an AMOLED display.

If I was doing color-sensitive work, I'd use something more reasonable and accurate, like sRGB, but I very rarely do anything like that."
