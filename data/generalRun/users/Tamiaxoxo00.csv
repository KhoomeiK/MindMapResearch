SuicideWatch,ffifz4o,t3_eq5zqe,1579972958.0,I use to do that. I hope it gets better for you.
depression,fej263s,t3_ep4bw6,1579154142.0,I feel the same way but my reason is kinda different. I really appericate you posting this because most people don't understand it.
mentalillness,fej1xwy,t1_feiho4s,1579153932.0,"I relate to this. I have a problem picking out movies and shows to watch. There's too many choices and I take forever looking through them trying to decide on something to watch to distract myself enough to attempt to be productive, then I end up watching something I've already seen because I know what to expect."

runaway,fdzxbbu,t1_fdzv8bn,1578798066.0,"Sexual attraction really won't change anything. People get trapped by their boyfriend or girlfriend all the time and their relationship and attraction doesn't make them feel any less tramatized. You sound like you don't know from experience and if that's where your ignorance is coming from I'm glad. No one should have to go through that, anyways good luck, I hope you find better living situation."
runaway,fdzmz5w,t1_fdvn3es,1578791901.0,I can say I really didn't expect that to be your reasoning. As a rape survivor who has been raped by a male and female and spoken to many rape survivors I'm telling you right now You're not going to be less tramatized by being raped by a female. Being raped is an awful experience and gender had nothing to do with. It's the extreme violation and powerlessness that really messes you up and anyone can do that.
SuicideWatch,fdzk4qe,t3_enakk8,1578790952.0,"Yeah, sometimes my friends will talk about moving in together or even getting on a phone plan together and I'm like ""uhhhh Idk.."" I'm going to kill myself at some point and I don't want to screw my friends over financially by killing myself."
rape,fdku4py,t3_eltj3o,1578511203.0,"This definitely wasn't an accident. You cried and collapsed from weakness and he still decided to have sex with you. It's wrong and someone who cares about you would of thought about your feelings first. What normal person wants to have sex with someone who's sick and weak, that shouldn't be fun for anyone. I really believe he did this on purpose and he's manipulating you by being ""nice"". People like him do this more than once, I really hope you can leave him for your safety. I'm really sorry this happened to you."

SuicideWatch,fdhdkf4,t1_fdgqjzw,1578420450.0,Thank you. (:
SuicideWatch,fdhdh97,t1_fdgs9ox,1578420406.0,I'm sorry that you've been in so much pain with no support system. Sometimes people can't handle supporting others but it doesn't sound like your girlfriend was one of those people. She just sounds really mean and I think you're better off without her even though it must hurt tremendously. Just know that the people in this subreddit know what you're going through and know that you're telling the truth. You deserve to be with someone who believes you and will show you love and support when you express your pain. Do you have any friends and family that know what you're going through? I just hope you can find good people who can support you through this so you can be there for your baby. I think you deserve that.
SuicideWatch,fdg6f4v,t1_fct6x8w,1578381905.0,"That's true. But for me January is pretty hard  because of the new year and my birthday is in a few days. It just signifies another year wasted, another year of being alive when I shouldn't be, and it's just pretty freaky being another year older and it's like where did all the time go."
SuicideWatch,fdg6784,t1_fcsnlfo,1578381639.0,Thank you.
SuicideWatch,fdg62mq,t1_fcqfq4z,1578381489.0,"I'm still alive, I guess unfortunately.
Can I ask what happened on New Years?"
rape,fdc2qoh,t1_fdbu3em,1578265938.0,I agree with this. I think it's rape and he's probably lying about thinking you were awake. Though even if you were it's still rape.
rape,fdagkqd,t3_ejqwku,1578245847.0,I would say this is rape. He coerced you and I'm sure he knew that you didn't want to have sex. I can understand why in a scary situation like that you agreed. Your yes wasn't a real yes and he knew that. I'm really sorry this happened to you. Have you talked to anyone about this?

SuicideWatch,fcpi1af,t1_fcphjet,1577864885.0,"I think it's nice they were concerned and actually checked on you. It'd say they care and I hope for at least tonight you get to lean on them and get some kind of solace. I don't think you're a burden on someone for confiding in them and needing their support. I feel like most friendships should be like that, but I know sometimes being so suicidal can make you feel like a burden no matter what."
SuicideWatch,fcpg1ea,t1_fcpfny2,1577862373.0,Never having been born would have been nice. Sometimes I think about how I wish I could give my life to someone else. Someone who actually wants to live and has aspirations. I want to die so bad and plan to but there's people who really want to live but die anyways. It's so confusing and unfair.
SuicideWatch,fcp9nx9,t3_eidomk,1577855301.0,"Those times are very hard for me too, mostly because I shouldn't be alive and for the same reasons you said."

AskReddit,fbzye4r,t1_fbzrndd,1577268474.0,"I'm an American and I hate it. No one means it and you get so use to automatically saying ""I'm okay"" or ""I'm fine"" that you start to say it to your friends even though it's not true.
Then a lot of people say ""How are you?"" as a greeting and if you answer they look at you crazy and ignore you. It's so strange."
