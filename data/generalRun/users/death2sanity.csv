kurzgesagt,ffgoee8,t1_ffgis88,1579910993.0,That’s how mail do.

rhythmgames,fffafwv,t1_fff9xqc,1579879630.0,"There is no learning curve quite like the IIDX curve. There are walls. When you break through a walk, you’ll suddenly be zooming up until the next wall. It’s about every 2 numerical levels or so too, it seems.

I dunno how you play, but what carried me from the 4s and 5s to 7-9s was to basically treat it like touch-typing. One finger, one key. 

Downside to that is it was really, really hard to learn how to shift my fingers, especially for 11s. I cleared a handful of easy 11s before I stopped playing so much."

CollegeBasketball,fff93ha,t1_fff0p0t,1579878754.0,That depends. Are you old enough for Big 4 to have meaning?  Does Tobacco Road conjure up any rivalristic stirrings?
CollegeBasketball,fff8vqy,t1_fff6cjv,1579878610.0,"Yeah, no sane State fan (there are dozens of us) would say State/unc is anywhere near duke/unc in basketball. And I can get why kids whose parents didn’t grow up in the rivalry don’t understand given recent history. But there’s a rivalry there. And I appreciate ol’ Roy keeping that fire burning.

Just hope it don’t burn too hot come Monday."
