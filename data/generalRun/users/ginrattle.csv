KidsAreFuckingStupid,fey9d23,t1_feql7tj,1579442456.0,"I hope you told someone. Those poor kids dont stand a chance without someone intervening. 

You can request to remain anonymous, but they have to cite testimony given against them so if you don't want trouble from neighbor don't use information only you would know. Also, try to record as much as possible if you spot suspicious behavior. Many times children end back up with the parents (since that is the goal for DHHS) but when visitation and monitoring stop the behavior continues where it left off. 

Getting as much evidence against them may eventually have those kids put into the system, which might actually be a better shot than living there. I dont say that lightly."

As a woman, I know this guy who, when I first met him I thought he was like a fucking Adonis specimen. I mean this guy is ripped, he's tall, he's beautiful.

I know other men who don't fall into that category but are funny, confident, respectful who I absolutely fantasize about them. 

Good god, confidence and just treating women like actual people. Like friends whose opinion you value provided their opinions aren't completely shitty and also who you aren't respecting just in the off chance one will fuck you. It goes a long way towards one actually wanting to fuck you. Treating girls like people, like a friend.

It may be shedding that endometrial lining as waste, but that waste is *not* like poop.

But it's not like poop. Just blood. That being said. Yeah, blood coming from anywhere should be controlled and kept hygenic.
