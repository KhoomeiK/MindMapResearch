relationship_advice,ff7v2zg,t3_es4vn4,1579659057.0,"Hey there friend! Let me start off by saying I'm heavily biased because of personal experiences, and if you ever need to talk, please feel free to dm me :)

I'd like to take the time to say, I don't think you're too sensitive. I think he's *too insensitive.* He comes off hurt (""told me he’ll never be able to do anything right"")? That's some real bullshit right there. What does his sorry ass have to be upset about??? He actively offends you, you;re the one getting hurt, and then to top it off, he says it's your fault/you're too sensitive. The coming off hurt thing and telling you do that is a manipulative technique designed to guilt you.

There really is a possibility, he's not just being insensitive, and actively insulting you instead. Usually I can play devil's advocate but in this case sister, it's clear he doesn't have any intentions.  Let's use the example you mentioned (I'm already assuming there have been many but this is one of the recent ones that strikes the most? :/). I see no good reason for him to ""is that why you're eyes are close together?"" THERE IS NOTHING HE COULD HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH, nothing to learn from asking that. Let's say for the benefit of him, he was truly 'curious'. There's still a way to say the things you want to know, without hurting the people you care about. There's a way to express you didn't mean to hurt them, INSTEAD OF BLAMING THEM, and it's apologizing. I'm not even going to go onto your second example, because I'd go off for another paragraph ~~my dear, I'd write you an essay.~~

I know you must have had great times and experiences. But someone who really cares about you accepts you for who you are, and they aren't reluctant. They're happy to, because they love you, and your happiness is theirs, as it is vise versa. :)

I'm sorry if anything I said was of offense! Please know that was not the intention. Finally, if you're looking for advice? Hmm...it depends on what you want to do dear. Again, feel free to message me if I can be of assistance. <3 Best of luck,"

Having someone reassure you can help you slow things down, rethink things, and in general, help you calm down a little more. The other two are also true; it'll take a while so be patient on yourself because changing a mindset isn't that easy.

You can do it though, so I wish you luck :)"

YAwriters,fcp0l2c,t1_fcoi3ac,1577846812.0,"IDK in my experience, everyone I know prefers 3rd POV?

If I may ask what is your major/what kind of preparation did you do, and do you mean specifically preparation for 1st year as in preparation over the summer of grade 12?

Furthermore, do you have any regrets on the way your school was structured (I don't know, ex: too much time to do homework and not enough teaching in class, teaching was irrelevant to the testing, work was too easy and too much of a gap between high school and uni etc.)"

Times are changing and they're allowed to express themselves(and be accepted for it!), so why shouldn't they? 

Let's say there's this straight guy. He has a crush on a girl at 8, he hits 14 and all of his friends discuss who's hot and who's not in class, and at 17 he meets a really nice girl and really likes her and wants his parents to meet her.  


The experience of being LGBTQ is immensely different- I'm going to use gay as an example. You might be lucky enough to get supportive family, but then again, you might very well not. That's not to mention, all the people you'll meet throughout your life. Imagine being a kid and being gay and having someone in your life, immensely homophobic, say, a teacher. That shit, knowing you're disliked, maybe even hated, by someone, (not even someone you respected/admired), by a person at all, is terrible. For an aspect as seemingly little as the people i'm romantically attracted to, could make you a target of hate. Now think of some examples were you might be suspected of being gay, by a homophobe, ex: maybe liking musicals/theatre, or a tv show. You hide it- because you have to! So you repress your interests, which are partially bits of your identity, right?

&#x200B;

Canada's been legally decently progressive in relative for a while, and now factoring in the socially progressive circumstances; allows the LGBTQ the right to be themselves, maybe something some of them haven't had the freedom to be, ever. Keep supporting them please!"
