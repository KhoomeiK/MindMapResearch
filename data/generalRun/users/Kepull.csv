aww,ffg0w0t,t1_ffg0krv,1579896047.0,Its expensive and fills you with incredible amounts of worry. You can have meaningful conversations with a lot of people that aren’t your spawn. Sometimes their opinions are dumb and irresponsible which is problematic. All that just to be a grandparent? So foreign to me as I have absolutely zero desire to reproduce. And I actually care for other people’s children as my career!

NatureIsFuckingLit,ff9trmb,t1_ff935uk,1579721094.0,They are known to step over fences too which wouldn’t require stepping on unstable ground. They could just knock it over and walk right through but they purposefully step over.
worldnews,ff9t02q,t3_es5ol6,1579720604.0,Not surprised they don’t care for the environment when they don’t care for their own bodies. Coke is garbage.

IdiotsInCars,feafkk0,t1_fe9tuqw,1578948111.0,Ok but they hit OPs car and you legally have to stop. And you should also be paying attention to the movement of your car. No excuse.
IdiotsInCars,feaeret,t1_fe726tf,1578947814.0,If you’re not mature at all until 18 then why are 16 year olds given drivers licenses? If you’re big boy enough to get your license you’re big enough to accept consequences for being an idiot.
LifeProTips,fe9rsmq,t3_eo0pgm,1578940938.0,Wonderful tip. My grandma died last week and I definitely didn’t call her as much as I should/could have. Beating myself up about it.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fe8kxk1,t3_eo3qgr,1578927325.0,Justice is rare. My mom’s best friend was about to get married and her fiancé’s ex girlfriend shot him in the head in his driveway. Cold-blooded premeditated murder. She served less than 3 years.

UnethicalLifeProTips,fderokm,t1_fdepuyi,1578345196.0,Yes! we can hear them open it then slam it a second later every time. They order tons of packages so I think they might assume it’s a delivery but there’s never anything there! They also let their dog pee on their patio twice which rains down onto ours so I dumped a pitcher of water at their front door so hopefully it leaked in the doorway. The complex did say would be immediately evicted if they ever did that again.
UnethicalLifeProTips,fdem70g,t3_ekzj43,1578341969.0,Going through the same problem! Now we knock on our ceiling and make them think someone knocked on their door so they go open it.

confession,fd26jkr,t3_ejudlk,1578142469.0,Do something to change it. You made this life to hold you but it’s not working. Saying you would rather die than get a divorce is extremely selfish to the offspring YOU produced.
