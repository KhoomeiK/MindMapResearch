My GI was pressing me to start biologics just as the government was suing the manufacturers for using kickback and other schemes to push them onto consumers so hard, which prompted me to research the actual drugs more. Essentially the side effects, increased risks of other diseases, length of time he wanted me to commit to them, and the lack of actual proven success his own patients had when I pressed back on him prompted me to find an alternative. Biologics can and do eventually stop working as well, and I just wanted off the whole merry go round.

I found out about the herb qing dai and a herbal formula called Isatis Cooling here in the sub and just as I had read, I got notable relief literally the very first day I took them and gradually got better and better. Not one single pharmaceutical had done a better job for me in 16 years and I've gone an amazing amount of time with little to no symptoms. Had the best colonoscopy results last year I've had in probably 12 years. 

Long story short, my success with the herbs got me interested in Chinese medicine in general, and it's been the biggest health transformation in my life. 

I've read all the arguments against it, the idea that Chinese dont really get UC so how could they have effective medicine for it, lol, the lack of ""studies"" on safety, a trial or two that had dropouts, etc. I take all of that into account, and also realize it might only work for a certain percentage of people. Read the studies and what a single biologic (pick any one of them) has done to thousands of patients. I've worked in and studied Western medicine, specifically the pharmaceutical industry, and personally for a chronic illness I'll always look at TCM before Western pharmaceuticals. 

Again, the herbs are not for everyone, and make no mistake some are much stronger than a lot of UC medicine your doctor prescribes, and can have their own set of side effects you have to carefully monitor for.

I'm spoiled since I have services like Criterion, Sundance, and Kanopy to at least find independents that make it as far as to those venues, and more importantly a decent size film festival in my town every year to find some that haven't made it that far yet. 

Film festival sites to me are the best sources to compile your ""potentials"" lists.

franksinatra,fdd74h3,t1_fdd3e96,1578297757.0,"What I meant was I believe they were chosen for the Sinatra soundtrack because of the influence Bing and those songs had on Frank. His daughter Tina produced the series and Frank apparently had final word on it so it's very likely she discussed which Crosby songs to include and also that they had their choice of a huge library of Crosby recordings they were able to pick from.

I can't remember specifically if (or how) the songs were used in the actual film, but they open the soundtrack beautifully.  Tommy Dorsey (a much larger direct influence on Frank) gets half a dozen  songs on the soundtrack, Harry James gets one, and Billie Holiday get a single beautiful version of Lover Man. I think that's all very accurate of the proposition each of these musician's influence was on Frank."

I always think of these two early tracks when I think of him and Frank only because they were on the Sinatra miniseries soundtrack and were my real first intro to Bings music outside of his classic Christmas stuff. I'm sure they were specifically chosen as songs that had an impact of Frank:

OldSchoolCool,fd1l5d5,t1_fd0qbz6,1578132784.0,"They dated after she divorced Elvis (which literally killed him, I think). She inspired Robert to make a ton of cash in the music business, then left him and became Scientologist. Robert's cash attracted a woman named Kris, who gave birth to her future business asset named Kim. Robert later hid evidence for O.J. Simpson after he butchered two people to death. O.J. made Robert famous, which later made Kim famous enough to be friends with Paris Hilton. Kris saw how Paris became famous enough to have her own reality show after her sex tape came out and showed Kim how smart it would be to ""accidentally"" leak her own tape, but noted it would be better if it was with a rapper than some douchie white guy everyone hated. After marketing the tape to multiple bidders, she not only made money from it's sale, but also scored her own family reality show. At first the only person the general public recognized was the guy from the Wheaties cereal box. Not to be upstaged, Kim started sleeping with sports stars and more rappers. Not to be upstaged by Kim, the guy from the Wheaties box had a sex change operation, then left the country (I think), but not before installing his own Trojan horses into the show as proxies, his daughters from a previous marriage. The daughters didn't have as large of bootie as Kim, so they went other ways with it to attract attention--one became a slightly anorexic looking model, the other made her lips her bootie and made 1 billion dollars selling the idea that big lips attract men to her adorning teenage fans everywhere. To regain her throne, Kim married that rapper who got high and bum-rushed Taylor Swift that one time at the Grammys when he said Jay-Z's wife deserved it instead, and started naming their kids after district courts (I think).

Just because you've never seen a crime doesn't mean it's nonexistent. There is crime nearly every day in the city. There are plenty of sources of objective crime data on Palm Springs.

""Palm Springs has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to all communities of all sizes - from the smallest towns to the very largest cities. One's chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime here is one in 21. Within California, more than 96% of the communities have a lower crime rate than Palm Springs.""

""Palm Springs has a combined rate of violent and property crime that is very high compared to other places of similar population size. Regardless of whether Palm Springs does well or poorly compared to all other cities and towns in the US of all sizes, compared to places with a similar population, it fares badly. Few other communities of this size have a crime rate as high as Palm Springs.""

""For Palm Springs, we found that the violent crime rate is one of the highest in the nation, across communities of all sizes (both large and small). Violent offenses tracked included rape, murder and non-negligent manslaughter, armed robbery, and aggravated assault, including assault with a deadly weapon. According to NeighborhoodScout's analysis of FBI reported crime data, your chance of becoming a victim of one of these crimes in Palm Springs is one in 177.""

I don't know if any of these choices have been released since the article was written, but knowing Tina and Nancy, I doubt it, and unfortunately the unofficial releases are much harder to find because of them. These are NOT bootlegs as far as I know, they are simply unofficial or private recordings.

taoism,ff1rony,t3_er4o9u,1579484680.0,"just FYI ""Zen"" is a bastardized form of buddhism that eventually made it to the West. it has some distant Doaist roots, but it's closer to Japanese Zen Buddism than anything to do with Taoism. I'm guessing there are Buddhism subs on Reddit but I don't have any use for them personally. I'm all for minimalism and so forth, but I think as you advance in your Taoist practice, your furnishings arrangement or situation isn't going to make a lick of difference in your life."

I'm spoiled since I have services like Criterion, Sundance, and Kanopy to at least find independents that make it as far as to those venues, and more importantly a decent size film festival in my town every year to find some that haven't made it that far yet. 

Film festival sites to me are the best sources to compile your ""potentials"" lists. It's simply a matter of finding and following the festivals that consistently attract the types of movies you enjoy. maybe reverse search some recent indie movies you liked and go back and see which festivals originally screened/honored them and poke around there."

franksinatra,fdd74h3,t1_fdd3e96,1578297757.0,"What I meant was I believe they were chosen for the Sinatra soundtrack because of the influence Bing and those songs had on Frank. His daughter Tina produced the series and Frank apparently had final word on it so it's very likely she discussed which Crosby songs to include and also that they had their choice of a huge library of Crosby recordings they were able to pick from.

I can't remember specifically if (or how) the songs were used in the actual film, but they open the soundtrack beautifully.  Tommy Dorsey (a much larger direct influence on Frank) gets half a dozen  songs on the soundtrack, Harry James gets one, and Billie Holiday get a single beautiful version of Lover Man. I think that's all very accurate of the proposition each of these musician's influence was on Frank."
franksinatra,fdckotf,t3_ekajj1,1578277294.0,"Nice cross section of his songs, thanks. Bing was a legend and a huge influence on Sinatra's early career. I don't know what rumors you're referring to since I've never heard any, but I'd actually be interested haha. 

I always think of these two early tracks when I think of him and Frank only because they were on the Sinatra miniseries soundtrack and were my real first intro to Bings music outside of his classic Christmas stuff. I'm sure they were specifically chosen as songs that had an impact of Frank:

OldSchoolCool,fd1l5d5,t1_fd0qbz6,1578132784.0,"They dated after she divorced Elvis (which literally killed him, I think). She inspired Robert to make a ton of cash in the music business, then left him and became Scientologist. Robert's cash attracted a woman named Kris, who gave birth to her future business asset named Kim. Robert later hid evidence for O.J. Simpson after he butchered two people to death. O.J. made Robert famous, which later made Kim famous enough to be friends with Paris Hilton. Kris saw how Paris became famous enough to have her own reality show after her sex tape came out and showed Kim how smart it would be to ""accidentally"" leak her own tape, but noted it would be better if it was with a rapper than some douchie white guy everyone hated. After marketing the tape to multiple bidders, she not only made money from it's sale, but also scored her own family reality show. At first the only person the general public recognized was the guy from the Wheaties cereal box. Not to be upstaged, Kim started sleeping with sports stars and more rappers. Not to be upstaged by Kim, the guy from the Wheaties box had a sex change operation, then left the country (I think), but not before installing his own Trojan horses into the show as proxies, his daughters from a previous marriage. The daughters didn't have as large of bootie as Kim, so they went other ways with it to attract attention--one became a slightly anorexic looking model, the other made her lips her bootie and made 1 billion dollars selling the idea that big lips attract men to her adorning teenage fans everywhere. To regain her throne, Kim married that rapper who got high and bum-rushed Taylor Swift that one time at the Grammys when he said Jay-Z's wife deserved it instead, and started naming their kids after district courts (I think).

That's the story as I know it."
palmsprings,fczxlif,t1_fczt6g1,1578110359.0,"so you believe that crime data is made up *and* crimes are actually overreported? they list 274 violent crimes there, how many do you think there actually were?"

palmsprings,fczmdzc,t1_fczh1t9,1578104388.0,"I've lived, owned a security related company, worked with PS Police, and have personally witnessed and been a victim of violent crimes in the city. 

Just because you've never seen a crime doesn't mean it's nonexistent. There is crime nearly every day in the city. There are plenty of sources of objective crime data on Palm Springs.

""Palm Springs has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to all communities of all sizes - from the smallest towns to the very largest cities. One's chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime here is one in 21. Within California, more than 96% of the communities have a lower crime rate than Palm Springs.""

""Palm Springs has a combined rate of violent and property crime that is very high compared to other places of similar population size. Regardless of whether Palm Springs does well or poorly compared to all other cities and towns in the US of all sizes, compared to places with a similar population, it fares badly. Few other communities of this size have a crime rate as high as Palm Springs.""

""For Palm Springs, we found that the violent crime rate is one of the highest in the nation, across communities of all sizes (both large and small). Violent offenses tracked included rape, murder and non-negligent manslaughter, armed robbery, and aggravated assault, including assault with a deadly weapon. According to NeighborhoodScout's analysis of FBI reported crime data, your chance of becoming a victim of one of these crimes in Palm Springs is one in 177.""

palmsprings,fcz87yi,t3_ejmfqp,1578095648.0,"Personally I wouldn't walk anywhere at night in Palm Springs other than in the most crowded, well-lit sidewalks in the very heart of downtown. Even then you can stray literally one block and find yourself in trouble. Palm Springs has more violent crime than the rest of California, and has a higher overall crime rate than 95 percent of American cities.

franksinatra,fc8mins,t3_egnkfn,1577537975.0,"I agree some live stuff would be nice, but I'm pretty sure there's a good amount of unreleased studio stuff the girls are still sitting on. they simply don't want to release it mainly because they think it will ""diminish his brand"", which is absolutely ridiculous. They are thinking like 30 years in the past. Look at how Elvis stuff has been done, especially the FTD releases it's simply fantastic and has done nothing but satisfy fans and increase his brand.

In the last decade, this is by far the most awesome stash of Frank's unreleased material, nearly 100 new tracks: https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-voice-on-air-1935-1955-mw0002887297

I don't know if any of these choices have been released since the article was written, but knowing Tina and Nancy, I doubt it, and unfortunately the unofficial releases are much harder to find because of them. These are NOT bootlegs as far as I know, they are simply unofficial or private recordings.
