treeplanting,fehh099,t3_ep5ty3,1579116353.0,3 cents is alot and once you get going should be a difference of over 60$ a day
todayilearned,fece71l,t1_fecc1h7,1578971793.0,"This is partially true in much of Canada, but New Brunswick forests are sprayed with glyphosate to specifically kill of native hardwood species, to ensure that only conifers remain, which are not naturally supposed to grow in the acadian forest, and will create massive detriment to new brunswick ecosystems and forests as climate change pushes them even further out of their natural range"
todayilearned,feccqhc,t1_feccd0z,1578970869.0,"up to 50% of the biomass in a clear cut is typically left behind, or burned in slash piles. If you look at photos of coastal or alberta clear cuts, its horrible how often they fail to properly manage slash"
treeplanting,feccckx,t1_fecaas3,1578970631.0,"almost definitely yeah. Honestly, i'd try and find something in alberta as a rookie, its a nice balance between low quality standards and higher prices as well as better camp life so you get some of the benifits from both"
treeplanting,fec93hy,t1_fec8q0a,1578968823.0,"very high, theres still tons of companies hiring in BC or at least Alberta, there should at least be a spot at summit for you"
todayilearned,fec7dzg,t1_fec64hs,1578967929.0,"It's not quite that intense, today there is a thousands hoops to jump through in order to cult old growth, and it is usually selectively cut, or cut because of infestation and fire. About 5% of BC's forests are considered old growth, and around 30% of that is protected.

There is still alot of work to be done there though, and it's a good time to get involved as the provinces old growth management strategy is currently under review!"
todayilearned,fec74fn,t1_fec5vm7,1578967790.0,"if your at all interested in New Brunswick forestry i'd encourage you to join Stop Spraying NB on facebook and read up on it. Theres terrible things going on in our backyards that have been banned for years in the rest of Canada, all because of Irving's political power."
todayilearned,fec6y3i,t1_fec5jpp,1578967702.0,"tree farming implies plantation style farms which are common in the south of the US and warmer climates (think those trees in perfect rows/grid)

in Canada replanting is part of the silviculture industry, which is growing forests with the intent to be harvested, while still attempting to respect their role as wildlife habitat/ecosystems etc"
todayilearned,fec50bs,t1_fec4dbr,1578966740.0,People don't understand the extent of the Canadian forestry industry. Goto Google maps and zoom into any part of places like New Brunswick or especially the cariboo in BC and nearly the entire regions are absolutely covered in clear cuts at different stages of regrowth.
Quebec,fadznh3,t1_fad7y7w,1575990395.0,"Merci ! Foret ouvert est quand même fou comme ressource, je savais pas qu'il existé. Mais oui hahaha un peu plate comme réponse à le mystère... je pense que je vais continuer de dire des conneries d'extra terrestres et des complots du gouvernement"
