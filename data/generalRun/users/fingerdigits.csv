You can't blame this on 'greedy old people' is too simplistic.

europe,femvcb8,t1_femhpro,1579270587.0,"How about listening to these children instead of dismissing them? Arresting the abusers instead of protecting them? That would be a good start.

In case after case, it was clear that the authorities who should have been protecting these children were ignoring the issue. The police, social workers and local councillors knew what was happening but failed to act because were more worried about accusations of racism or sparking racial tensions. They turned a blind eye or actively covered up the crimes. In some instances, members of the police force and local councillors were actually involved in the crimes.

And over the years various people have tried their best to tell warn us about the issue. Parents of the abused, concerned citizens, politicians, journalists. However, these voices were ignored; they were vilified. They were accused of being racist. Their newspaper articles were dismissed as hateful lies. They were fired from their jobs – MP Sarah Champion wrote in the Sun about grooming gangs in Rotherham. She was called a racist and was fired from her shadow cabinet position.

Occasionally, instead of arresting the abusers the police arrested abused:

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7045699/Grooming-gang-victim-reveals-raped-100-men-deaths-threats.html

In one horrific example, police were called to a house at three in the morning after a neighbour heard a girl screaming. When they arrived, they discovered two young girls, drunk and half naked in the house with 7 Pakistani men. Instead of asking the obvious questions and arresting these men, they arrested the 13 year-old girl for being drunk and disorderly.

This video is of a short talk given by Andrew Norfolk who reported on this case and others. He outlines the abuse committed by grooming gangs in Rotherham and the ways the authorities covered this abuse up.
