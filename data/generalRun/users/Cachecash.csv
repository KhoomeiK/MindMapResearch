WordsWithFriends,ffgzpw9,t3_etf86k,1579919242.0,Just came here to vent about it. I was hoping it was a glitch on my app.

How did they count the pitch? Ball or just a do over?"
Wellthatsucks,fewyppn,t3_eqrf0q,1579421534.0,Poor kid will be addicted to sugar by the time she’s 3. My 7 year old has yet to try soda and I see no reason to let him for a few more years.
