It's been gone over several times these past few weeks - they can't just stay here doing whatever for as long as they like."
funny,ffc42fa,t1_ffc2prb,1579791025.0,That's not how it works - at all... I'm not sure where you're getting your information from
funny,ffc2e0h,t1_ffc1etd,1579789820.0,Well neither of them are citizens - so...
ThriftStoreHauls,ffc158h,t1_ffc0t5g,1579788889.0,Right?! Could wear them casual or a bit dressy.
ThriftStoreHauls,ffc1454,t1_ffc0xj3,1579788865.0,haha I'll keep you in mind if I decide to sell them!
funny,ffby4uq,t1_ffbwp3u,1579786489.0,They're not saying here - they'll be off to LaLa land before you know it.
ThriftStoreHauls,ffbwmf1,t1_ffbw4hu,1579785182.0,It was at one of my local Goodwills and thank you!
funny,ffbw1hn,t3_esr01a,1579784655.0,"Yah it was clear from the get-go who wears the trousers in this relationship, the photo just personifies it."
funny,ffbvxz7,t1_ffbvs5k,1579784562.0,Exactly. It's only going to get worse for him - there are no 'rules' now like there were before. I think he thinks the grass is greener and is about to find out it's not. And I don't see her sticking around to tough it out with him.
ThriftStoreHauls,ffbrpkj,t1_ffbrfzi,1579780147.0,They're a 40/7
Edmonton,ffbp9u5,t1_ffarslr,1579776895.0,OP said in original post they looked at Audrey's
ThriftStoreHauls,ffbnsjf,t3_esr5e0,1579774694.0,"As mentioned - found these a few months ago. They were in the bottom of a bin filled with shoes, I just happened to notice them sticking out. Couldn't believe my luck. They're a bit too big but if I really wanted to wear them I could. For now, they're tucked away in the closet and I look at them sometimes. Also considering trying to sell them but haven't quite made up my mind."
Edmonton,fenvogr,t1_fenab8b,1579291628.0,"I hope If she does go unclaimed, they do find her a home and aren’t forced to put her down, if she in fact needs a lot of medical attention ect."
AskReddit,femzu5j,t1_femyonn,1579273779.0,"I don't think I was naive - I work in a highly competitive industry that is quickly shrinking for opportunities. Even if I had put the effort in, some of which I wasn't too keen on, there is a likely chance I'd found myself out of the business altogether. I'm in a middle ground. Sometimes I have my ""On the Waterfront"" moment but then I go back to - nah, this worked out the way it was supposed to"
AskReddit,femzicf,t3_eq117v,1579273556.0,"I am Canadian - always have been.  
It's a great place to live - the pros I feel outweigh the cons.  
Someone mentioned taxes, I actually don't think it's bad, considering what 'we' get out of it. I'd much rather live in a society that pays more taxes and takes care of it's people than not ... ie Sweden, Norway ect.  
Cellphones are expensive but things are changing. I have a full coverage plan that costs me $30 a month."
AskReddit,femwpjk,t3_eq0ske,1579271592.0,"We're supposed to have a plan?

I had a specific goal in mind when I started my career - it never panned out, a lot of it because I didn't like the work I'd have to get from point A to B. Which is fine, I really don't think I would have enjoyed it as much as I wildly imagined."
AskReddit,femw8j3,t1_femuudk,1579271245.0,Don't you get tired of reposting the same thing over and over again in all these subs?
gifs,femt7gi,t3_epu3d1,1579268921.0,I love wombats! I was in Australia and had a few interactions with them - including a sweet little fella who kept trying to eat the decals off my flip-flops. I just wanted to pick him up and carry him around.
Edmonton,femjs4u,t1_fem5jfm,1579259159.0,I hope you can keep him - he appears to be in rough shape and in need of some love. I see you posted further down that you've seen him before but maybe he's unwanted by the other folks? And as far as dogs go - they do eventually get over it lol. They usually don't like it at first but most of the time they come around - I've been there.
Whatcouldgowrong,fek1h0s,t1_fejr0s9,1579190579.0,"I get that. But who is letting her watch that type of content?   
it’s no wonder so many kids have mental issues, body issues ect at such an early age now. My eyebrows were one of the last things on my mind until I was like 14."
Edmonton,fejskrc,t1_fejpmxd,1579184817.0,Until the frostbite was setting in and she was in excruciating pain? Just because you don't 'feel' it - doesn't mean it's not happening.
Whatcouldgowrong,fejqhx6,t1_fejq1n2,1579183282.0,Yah. I mean I get times have changed since I was a kid but ... who is exposing her to this sorta thing?I get you can't supervise kids all the time but she's seeing it somewhere.
Whatcouldgowrong,fejn334,t3_ephrwi,1579180420.0,Seems a bit young to A. be worrying about that B. ... be using a razor.
AskReddit,fejkoi5,t3_epfjje,1579178120.0,"Some of these stories make mine look sad in comparison and I hope to never experience them.   
Worst was probably post wisdom teeth - had the bottom two surgically removed. Got dry sockets in the both. I remember laying on my bed just wishing I'd blackout for a bit to get away from the constant pain.  
A needle in the foot (for anesthetic ) also not a ton of fun.  
And a ulcerative colitis flare is aaaawwwwful."
EarthPorn,fejear6,t1_feil9fl,1579169882.0,A rainbow trout.
Edmonton,fegaz4u,t1_fefrv0y,1579085604.0,I always find the weather network to be garbage and rarely correct. I think Environment Canada is usually more accurate.
cats,feg99iy,t3_eot8g6,1579083192.0,"Super cute!! So much love.

But also - are those essential oils behind them? Just make sure you're using them safely around your new pets - they can in some instances be harmful."
AskReddit,fedlklk,t1_fedakjz,1579014524.0,YES!
AskReddit,fedleun,t3_eojqln,1579014416.0," Jackie Chiles   
Just kidding - definitely  Annalise Keating"
AskReddit,fedcriu,t1_febfi8u,1579007805.0,Yes - Kd's version is the best IMO
AskReddit,fedco6l,t3_eoapu0,1579007721.0,"Twist and Shout - the Beatles version is far superior.   
Actually a lot of their covers were better than the originals but that's just me.   
And I like Celine Dion's River Deep, Mountain High version better.   
Same with Shameless - Garth Brooks over Billy Joel"
AskReddit,fed8lmm,t3_eo5orh,1579003753.0,What actually happens when we die? Is there actually something 'after' this?
cats,fed10oo,t3_eocqsw,1578993277.0,She looks so smart and sweet - such an expressive little face.
Edmonton,feaia7j,t1_fe838pc,1578949113.0,"You’ll be fine, weather wise. i am sure we will be back to seasonal. Plus, there is not bad weather, just bad clothing.

and I think all the good spots close by have been well laid out. If you’re looking for something a little fancier, there are a few around the area too. But I’m big into good beer and burgers/tacos...which there are lots of."
