One day, you and your buddies get in a firefight with an armored vehicle.

The simplicity of Chip's offense is its greatest strength and its greatest weakness.  The plays are simple so it should be easy to execute them expertly.  When everyone executes, mismatches are found and you scoop up large chunks of yards.  The downside is when people are off just a bit.

One day, you and your buddies get in a firefight with an armored vehicle.  You guys make expert shots but you don't know the weaknesses of the vehicle so your shots are extremely accurate but target the wrong parts of the vehicle.

By comparison, Darth Vader's elite squad went to retrieve the droids.  They are pretty accurate but more importantly they know exactly where to fire into the transport vehicle to take it out and they have the right weapons to do the job.

TLDR:  Above average shooting with appropriate weapons and knowledge of your target's weaknesses is far superior to Expert shooting with the wrong weapons for the job and no knowledge of your target's weaknesses."

To this day people don't understand how Chip's offense works.  Anyone can go watch the tape.  Players were wide open all the time and just weren't targeted or dropped the balls.  The simplicity of Chip's offense is its greatest strength and its greatest weakness.  The plays are simple so it should be easy to execute them expertly.  When everyone executes, mismatches are found and you scoop up large chunks of yards.  The downside is when people are off just a bit.  Dropping the 1st and 10 pass, missing your block, etc is that much more devastating under Chip's system."

Tampa Bay has a legitimate offense and could easily move on from their QB.  The plus side is Brady will show he can still play.  The downside is that he probably wouldn't win another ring.  

NE will offer a top-end salary because Tom has them bent over a barrel right now.  Tom couldn't get this offense to work.  Imagine how bad a Stidham led offense would be.  Patriots also don't have a high pick to grab a QB that is ready to play.  This would look really bad for Kraft and Belichick if Brady goes somewhere else and succeeds and the Patriots are trash.


Ultimately, I think NE promises Brady to pick a WR/TE in the 1st and 2nd and work with what they have.  Kraft is going to overrule Belichick on this one."
