wholesomememes,ffqow2y,t1_ffq4omp,1580140192.0,Yes! This comment makes me happy. It's so nice and weird to find that person you can be around for an extended period of time. Didn't think it was possible. I have never found someone I could be around for more than maybe a day without needing a break. Now we live together.
wholesomememes,ffqoens,t1_ffq3dm5,1580139865.0,"Thanks! Being introverted, for me at least, means it's incredibly hard to find people to click with and learning to be okay with that. But it does happen and when you least expect it."
wholesomememes,ffqnaxb,t1_ffq1pt3,1580139096.0,"We met at work. I also have a hard time making friends, and the only people I've made friends with since becoming an adult are people I work with and that's pretty rare. I still have no friends, just him and like one person I text with every few months talking about hanging out and then leaving super open ended plans neither of us make an effort for lol. 

So, we were just work friends for about a year. He ended up changing shifts after a couple months so we just said ""hey,"" here and there.  During that time we both ended pretty bad relationships and a few months later I gave him my number because I hardly saw him anymore and figured why not, never gave a guy my number before. Wasn't expecting much, but I got more than I could hope for."

Both with some baggage and trauma, and we don't try to fix each other. We've made a nice home and family and just live normal, moderately happy/comfy lives now. It really is a amazing, coming from where I was a few years ago. He also (almost) always wears a beanie."
insaneparents,ffhqkvj,t1_ffhlf61,1579948640.0,"No problem! The best bet to find a place with no credit is through a landlord rather than an aprtment organization. I would say to be prepared for rejection/dissapointment but don't give up. There are people and places that rent to people with low or no credit but it usually requires more money. Some things I would keep in mind are paying a higher deposit, or paying first and last month's rent plus deposit. If you talk to an actual landlord or the owner, you could offer this up front. Craigslist and similar sites are a good place to start (of course be aware of sketchy situations). Also, roommate situations might be ideal for a first place. And if it's at all possible, a co-signer would greatly improve your chances, though that may be hard to find given your situation (anybody with decent credit can be a cosigner, if you can think of anyone that may be willing to). Again, community resource websites can help with housing. Location is another one to consider. If you live in a place with a college nearby, they have places desinged for students near campus that aren't part of the school. Where I live, you don't need to be student to live there but they're tiny. Ummm.. Also, they look for stable income. So providing proof you receive a steady paycheck and have for a while is definitely good (the longer the better). There is hope! I know this would suck, but worse case scenario, you can't find a place right away. If you work on building credit, you should be able to find a place after 6 months. Not ideal but something to keep in mind.

As far as interest rates go, it gets complicated. To my knowledge, it depends on what it's for. A loan has yearly interest, so you pay a percentage extra on what you borrowed per year. Credit cards are similar but different. If you buy an item on credit and pay it off by the due date, you won't owe extra money and have nothing to worry about. If you only pay part of it though, you start to accrue interest on the remaining balance. And the interest is applied daily, so each day you owe a little bit more than you did yesterday. If you buy something else and add to that balance, the interest is applied to the new balance meaning you'll pay even more. This continues until you pay the balance completely, interest and all. Once it's paid in full and you have a $0 balance, you no longer acrrue interest until you have a cycle where you don't pay in full again. So, it's not a bad deal if you pay the full balance. If you don't, it can rapidly develope into debt that takes much longer to pay. 

I hope that helps some!"
insaneparents,ffhjo82,t1_ffhcd5o,1579938327.0,"Credit takes time, like months to build. But if he has no debt, see if he can get a credit card with a low limit. For me, with bad credit (in the 400's) I found a credit card that I had to pay $99 for as a ""safety net"" and it had a $200 limit on it. Its called a Secured Card (try Capital One). You get the money back if you cancel the card so long as you don't owe. Keep the spending to 9% of the credit allowance or less every month, no more than that but make sure you buy at least something (something you'd buy anyways is always the best). And pay it the day it's due, not early and definitely not late (set up automatic payments). Within a few months my credit raised 60 points. 2 years later it's in the low 600's. So, I'm assuming it will work for no credit especially with no pre-existing debt like I had. Credit Karma is great for monitoring your credit (its super nice to actually see it go up a couple points). Takes about 6 minths to build credit per Google.

I'm telling you this because no one told me, other than credit is important. I had no idea how hard it was to build and easy to break and that it meant I couldn't easily find a place to live or buy a car. If I could do it over again at 18, I'd take my own advice. It's a huge step in financial freedom.

I'm not an expert by any means and everyone's story and situation is different. 5 years ago I moved to a new state across the country with $80 in my pocket and suitcase of clothes. I got pregnant shortly after that, and I had to figure everything out on my own. I had no one. But I did it and after a couple rough years I have a nice home with my child and (new) SO. So, it's doable but very hard. The best housing is cheap housing, even if it means having a (or multiple) roommate(s). If it's the two of you together, it can be much easier but be wary of tying your finances to closely with someone else. 

Also, do financial planning. Breakdown his income vs bills to live. Include food and other necessities. Then add the amount of rent (look up local places on Google/Zillow/Rent.com/etc.) he would potentially be paying plus utilities. Is it doable? Is it livable? What can he cut back on to make it work? Moving out is a big step and like, failure sucks. But it's always a risk. The best thing he can do right now is to see if he can feasibly make it on his own and go from there. Take immediate action to make it possible (more hours, second job, etc.). They have things online like Mint or Nerd Wallet that help you budget and monitor your spending. 

Is he still in high school? There may be programs to help high school students out. Also, community helpline centers (Google for your area) are good and should either give you lists of places/resources/info you're looking for or put you in contact with someone that can. Once he does a budget, that should really tell him all he needs to know about what he can handle financially. If he can make it on his own, then maybe it's time to start looking. Also, does he possibly have anyone else in his life he can live with cheap or even free while he gets on his feet? That would be another thing to check. 

There's also other local resources to check out. Where I'm at they have a housing program that will vouch for you if you have bad credit or a criminal record, basically saying ""we take financial responsibility if this tenent doesn't work out"" and a lot of places accept it. It requires a 2 day class. So, check out things like that! 

Other than that, I'm sorry to hear about the mess your partner is in. That really sucks. My dad was an alcoholic, so I understand the unpredictable moods and violence. And the smell. Ugh. 

Tl;dr The most important things in my mind are: Budget weekly and project your budget monthly (or further) so you know what to expect and what the limits are, work on credit asap, save as much as you can, start planning and stick to it, and check out local resources.

Like I said, if I could do it all over again, I'd do things different. I wish you both the best. Sorry for the long unorganized comment. I'm pretty wordy sometimes."

I also just recalled being pushed to give her a kiss on the forehead, which I didn't want to. I still remember the cold, stiff feeling of kissing a dead body.  At some point I was given her glasses back. They were wiped off but still had dried blood in the grooves.

I've seen ""more disturbing"" things since then but this one is obviously very personal, which is why I think it's the worst."
