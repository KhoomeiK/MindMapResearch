This probably gives the impression I'm an incompetent player, but I can assure folks I'm not. I was 22 when OG wow launched, and have played Hunter ever since. At this point though, on the next go 'round, I'm just experimenting and having fun trying to push the boundaries of solo once again. (I've never been big on guilds and avoid them where possible)"

It's also super useful for complicated solo pulls where you can use it to position exactly and need just a bit more time.

Very simply; male pigeons are quite larger and have a bulbous sort neck thing going on that they swell out as a display. Also, their eyes are shaped differently (males are very much round and larger, female smaller and tend to ""sink in"" to the ""cheek"" as it were)... also males tend to have a larger head and drag their feathers on the ground as a display.

Hope that helps!"
ConvenientCop,fec2noj,t1_febqq2v,1578965774.0,"See it ALLLLLL the time out here on 71 in-between Bastrop and Austin. Got those goofy Sheriff pickup trucks they sit on the side of the road with, and wait to pop trucks coming by. 

Almost always really beat up looking dump trucks or trailer gravel haulers. Surprise surprise, the only people I've directly observed getting pulled over? Hispanics/Mexicans. (I think some clarification needs to be made here, my feigned surprise is that the cops are ONLY seeming to pull over Hispanics/Mexicans - I've seen equally beat up trucks with white guys just roll on by) They basically just seem to sit and wait for those folks because I see PLENTY of other trucks go by.

EDIT: Not sure why the downvotes, these cops out on 71 racially profile pretty much the entire time. If you're white, not in a beemer or lexus or something like that, and on 71, you're good to go.

Luxury vehicle of some kind? Best watch your ass. Doesn't matter what race, they'll be pulling you over.

Where I live it's become quite apparent that racial profiling is back and bigger than before."

The actual full video for context, and context is important. This cop was professional AF. The WHOLE time. 

Believe me, I'm no cop apologist, my immediate reaction is generally to distrust the ""authority,"" but man... this guy gave her all the chances he could.

Also, let's be real here. She was acting like a fucking bitch in this scenario (gender notwithstanding) and the human element is ALWAYS present in any situation. ANYBODY would be frustrated by this and want to end it quickly.

I look at this like a parent punishing a child, except the child is a full grown adult who should know there are consequences for their actions and the parent is a person who is just simply trying to do their job and is forced into using the full amount of their power to take control of the situation.

Hate cops all you want, but when it boils down to it, a cop must ALWAYS be in control of a situation. Smart people know this. 

I'm sure we can guess what she isn't. Shit, she can't even own up to it when she's done being tazed, in fucking cuffs, and in the back of the car.
