Don't want a kid?  Too fucking bad, shit happened and now you got one.  Support it.  Be a part of it's life.  If you don't you are a piece of shit.  

If you have MORALS, you don't walk away from and refuse to support a child with your DNA.   For that matter, some would say that if you have MORALS you don't have one night stands."
unpopularopinion,fdhhutq,t1_fdh71rk,1578422966.0,That was answered in another person's comments.  Methinks you just want someone to argue with and you don't seem to know how to argue well.

What about small business owners?  College students?  Military veterans?  No one group should have more political power than another.  That's  how our political system is supposed to work.  One person, one vote."
CasualConversation,fdf1wta,t3_ektuxq,1578351434.0,"If you think it looked like fun and since it is possible for you to do it at your weight, you should go do it.  

The instructors won't care about your weight other than to adjust wind speed to hold you up.  They've helped other people your size to fly in the tunnel. They wouldn't offer flights to heavier people if it wasn't safe.  

I'm a skydiver and go to a tunnel fairly often.  It is SO much fun, and even more so for those who have never experienced freefall before.  It is almost exactly like being in freefall.  You can fly!

Seriously.  Go do it.  You won't be sorry."

AskWomenOver30,fd9kxpk,t3_ejp6sa,1578234815.0,"We just finished our bathrooms.   Overall they aren't luxurious; they are small and the materials we used weren't the most expensive (not the cheapest either).   We upgraded all the lighting to LED - it's super bright in both bathrooms now - and we upgraded the ventilation as well.  Replaced a pedestal sink with a vanity (drawers and cabinet ftw) in the front bath (am I the only one who thinks pedestal sinks are ridiculous?) .  The master already had a big vanity base with a bunch of drawers and four big wall cabinets. 

We did spring for one bit of indulgence.  The master bath has a combination whirlpool tub/steam shower.  It's got a handheld shower head, an rainfall shower head and acupuncture jets - and a radio even.  We call it the Escape Pod.  Not cheap but worth every penny at the end of a long day! 

Have fun with the remodel!"
AskWomenOver30,fd9ipb0,t3_ejzc90,1578233951.0,"I used to be exactly like you!  ADD plus full time job plus too much stuff... it gets to the point of not even knowing where to start.  I didn't have people over to my house because I was too embarrassed to let anyone see how I lived.

What helped me the most was decluttering.  I had too much stuff in too small spaces.  Did a huge purge and reduced the stuff in the house.  Not totally minimalist, but very little decorative stuff (that needs dusting) and ""I have to keep this because it was gramma's"" kind of stuff.   

It's so much easier to clean a place when it's not cluttered.  It really does take a few minutes at a time to keep it up - like others have said, break it up into small pieces throughout the week - much easier to think about cleaning the toilet after work than think about cleaning the whole place on Saturday.   

And give yourself a break.  ADHD means that some days it just won't get done. IOW don't beat yourself up about not getting the toilet clean today, just make a point of doing it first thing tomorrow."

I could be wrong of course.  You should tell your dad about it and see what he thinks.
