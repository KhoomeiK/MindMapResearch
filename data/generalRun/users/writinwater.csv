She could just not be good at conversation; some people aren't. She may feel like you're taking up all the conversational space and there's no room for her to talk comfortably. She might just straight up not like you and not want to talk to you. There are a hundred reasons, but they all boil down to the two of you having horribly mismatched communication styles. I really think that's all this was and you're NTA. I would say NAH except that she in fact sounds like kind of an asshole."

To be honest, I'd be weirded out if a friend of my boyfriend's asked questions about my dad and his work too. I don't know that I'd jump to the same conclusions she did, but there would definitely be a talk with my bf about his friends and boundaries."
AmItheAsshole,ffcfxvf,t1_ffcavoe,1579798614.0,"Yeah, no, this is actually you being melodramatic. In fact, I suspect this is you deciding after it was too late that you didn't want to be a husband and father after all, which is why you're so dead set on never seeing your son again. If you were really that upset because she had him circumcised, you'd try to get custody of him instead of leaving him with your wife.

Pro tip: the point of good manners and respect is to make other people feel comfortable and valued, not to make them feel uncomfortable. If you insist on doing something that makes her uncomfortable, you are doing both good manners and respect wrong. You're also being disrespectful of her wishes and calling it ""respect,"" which is weird.

Your MIL might actually not feel as respected by you as you think she should, is what I'm saying here."

You reek. You don't realize it, but you do.

Imagine how light-headed and sick you'd get. Imagine the dawning panic when the elevator doors didn't open, and didn't open, and the smell got stronger and stronger and your throat started to close, and you knew that even after you got off the elevator and could breathe again you'd be carrying the smell of that horrible perfume in your clothes and hair for the rest of the day.

If you live in a large city, remember the first time you saw that one subway car was almost empty and thought you'd lucked out?

Look, my whole family is Insomnia Central. From cradle to grave, none of us want to pry ourselves out of bed before noon. Few things suck worse than trying to get a teenager out of bed on four hours' sleep because they just can't fall asleep before one in the morning. I wanted to kill my kids between 6 and 7 AM for five years.

But kids have to go to school. It's literally the law. Once they leave home, they'll have to get up for work and school by themselves, and if they have actual sleep disorders, that's going to take practice and a lot of work.

AmItheAsshole,felkc50,t3_epm9l7,1579224246.0,"YTA. Why did you make this ring for her?  


No, really. Why? It clearly wasn't for her to wear, or you wouldn't just want her to wear it for special occasions, and you wouldn't be so unforgiving of the fact that, when people wear things, sometimes they get lost. It clearly wasn't because you thought the time spent in making her happy was worth it, or you wouldn't be talking lke it was a waste of your time to make the first one and would be a further waste of your time to make another one. It clearly wasn't to make her happy, or you'd be willing to make another one to make her happy again.   


Why did you make this ring for your wife? What did you expect to get out of making it and giving it to her that was so important that you're this angry at her for losing it? What did *you* lose when she lost the ring that was so important that you're treating her like shit for losing something, which happens to everyone, and which would probably not have happened to her if you'd sized it accurately?

AmItheAsshole,felgui6,t3_ephhub,1579221853.0,"So, a lot of the comments on this post are focused on whether autistic children should be blamed for their behavior and what will happen when they get to be adults and yadda yadda, but for me, as a person who hates being touched, the deal is this: you do not have to tolerate someone touching you all the fucking time without your consent and against your will, regardless of why they do it. You just don't. You are NTA here.

I don't know why your boyfriend has his nephew living with him. After a certain point, it doesn't matter. The nephew does live there, and regardless of why that is or what the nephew's issues are, you need to decide whether you can live in that environment. If you can't, and if the price of living with your boyfriend is dealing with his nephew touching you all the time, it's 1000% okay to decide that you can't live like that and you need your own space.

Your boyfriend's nephew may not change. He may not understand why what he's doing is not okay. That's a problem for him, but it's a problem for *him* and his caretakers - it's not yours to solve. If you can't live with him as he is and you can't get him to stop touching you, move out. If your boyfriend respects you, he'll understand. If he doesn't understand... well, look, it sucks, but your boyfriend's nephew's problem is not your problem by some transitive property of having sex with the boyfriend. If a situation is intolerable, don't tolerate it, and don't pay attention to people who try to shame you for it. Your life is your life; your comfort is your comfort. You are allowed to opt out.

The thing is, your parents are wrong. You're not a built-in babysitter. You're certainly not a standby parent. You're under no obligation to be excited about a new sibling who's 16 years younger than you are, with whom you will probably have nothing in common until the baby is 70 and you're 86 and you're teaming up to harass the mean lunch ladies at the nursing home.  


However. Just because you feel something doesn't mean it has to come out of your mouth. Your parents are excited about the new baby, as prospective parents are. You could have avoided this whole thing by just smiling and nodding and letting your parents have their excitement over the new baby.  


On the other hand, you really shouldn't have to, and your parents shouldn't have pushed the issue and expected you to be as over the moon as they are. That's why my decision ultimately comes down on the NTA side. Your parents should maybe talk to a family therapist who can educate them on the dynamics of late-life child-bearing where siblings are already in the picture."

Sometimes you stay in a marriage because you're too immature or too invested in the idea of marriage as an institution to leave a relationship that's clearly become damaging to everyone involved. Sometimes it's more mature, more moral, and more kind to let everyone walk away and find their place where they were really meant to be."

1. He's fucking his co-worker and he doesn't care if you know.
2. Do you like the person you are when you're with him? Is this the person you want to be for the rest of your life?
3. Contempt is the relationship-killer. You can come back from fights, mistakes, bad behavior, even affairs, as long as you respect each other. When you have as much contempt for each other as it sounds like you do, it's pretty much over and it's been over for a long time. You didn't get here overnight.

I might be wrong. Go to marriage counseling and see. But if you want permission to just move forward and call it a day, you've got mine."

AmItheAsshole,fcvn9zb,t1_fcn7awc,1578005771.0,"I sure as fuck would. You know why? Because a co-worker's grandfather should not matter more to him than the birth of his first living child. There are literally no circumstances under which his baby should not be more important than someone else's grandfather. Anyone who believes otherwise is not fit to have children and should never even try, and I include OP in that assessment.  


If you aren't going to make your baby the most important thing on the planet, don't have one. Period. If you're too much of a chickenshit to have ""that conversation,"" parenthood is not for you."

Because you're still talking about it like you went out for beers with the boys after work without telling her and came home at three in the morning, and if you bring her flowers it will be okay again.  


Listen. My ex-husband did the same thing you did. Delivery time approached, he panicked, made himself scarce, lied to himself that he had plenty of time, and I went through labor, an emergency c-section, and life-threatening post-partum hemorrhage by myself. So I'm speaking from experience when I tell you that your wife will never forgive you for this.  


She might honestly try. She might tell you she has. But she won't, because this is beyond ""Oopsie, sorry, I'll try to do better."" Put forgiveness out of your mind; you won't get it and you don't deserve it. That's not the task right now. Your task now is to find out if the two of you can move past this, which will involve a shitload of therapy in which you will learn a lot of things about yourself that won't be very flattering.   


For the rest of your life, every time there's a situation where you need your wife to depend on you or to trust you, she's going to look at you and see long hours of terror and agony delivering a baby that could be dead for all she knew, which was an event that you just... decided not to show up for. You don't get a mulligan on this one. Your only chance to save your marriage is if you accept that and try to find a way for the both of you to move on."

You don't get to screw your wife over like that, break your promise to her, arbitrarily decide she and her opinions don't count, and then pat yourself on the back for being someone who keeps your word.

Your friend is sick of hearing about it and has no sympathy left. You've forgiven him for treating you like a blow-up doll because he bought you flowers. This dude is going to be like this for the rest of his life because he gets away with it so he's got no reason to change.

My vote stands, but I'm with your friend here. Known idiots are gonna idiot. If you make the choice to stay with this dude knowing what he's like and how little respect he has for you, you're going to have to suck up nonsense like this, because that's the price of being with him.

This is not rocket science. This person is making and selling images of other people's minor children, for profit, without doing any sort of due diligence about whether the parents of that minor child are aware. That's shady as fuck.

If you can't be bothered to inform yourself about the legal aspects involved in making and selling art, you're not ""innocent,"" you're negligent and maybe you in fact should lose your business over it. Other negligent businesses do. No one gets to be immune from the consequences of their business decisions just because they're selling replicas of dead babies."
AmItheAsshole,fcscvl2,t1_fcij3p7,1577914767.0,"Please sit with your therapist a while on this one. There's no rush.

The doll maker fucked up. I'm sorry, but they did. If you're in the business of selling products made in the likeness of someone's minor child, and the people requesting that product are clearly not the child's parents, you do your due diligence to find out whether the parents are okay with it or you refuse the commission. Failing to do that makes the doll maker as shady as the in-laws.  You don't sell replicas of real babies to random creepers.

But lawsuits can take years. Don't start one like this when it might keep you from moving on and healing. Write the doll maker a letter detailing what happened, her part in it, and how it's made you feel and send it to her by certified mail. Put her on blast on social media so other doll makers will be a little more careful in the future. A lawsuit isn't the only way to get across to her that her shady business practices caused immense pain; it's just the most expensive for you."

I hope you're reading this, because I need you to know that this does not have to be the rest of your life. I know it probably feels like you're stuck because you don't have money and it sounds like you live in the middle of nowhere, but you don't have to be. You do not have to live in this emotional crackhouse with an abusive old woman and a spineless manchild who threatens to kick you out of a home he doesn't even think is yours and not just his and who thinks you're not good enough to stand up and say no to being abused. 

There are social services. There are shelters. There's Reddit. Start looking. 

OP, you are YTA and I hope you're a divorced asshole very soon. 

Things can be better than this."
