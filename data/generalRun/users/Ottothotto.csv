Damnthatsinteresting,fd0hnbm,t1_fd001n5,1578118930.0,"So I can't speak for all working animals but I can speak for service dogs.

These guys continue working until their owner sees fit. That's literally it, theres no retirement age so dogs can work right until their last breath and some dogs take early retirement due to injury or just not wanting to work anymore this is know as 'washing'.

I think the most appropriate age is depending on the breeds, dogs that don't live long like great Danes may stop at 6 years old, while dogs that do live long should probably stop at 10 years old so instead of working all their lives they can relax for the last few years they have left.

But mainly it depends on the dog itself to be fair.

Advice,fcyfej6,t3_ejciai,1578079254.0,"Okay so I have autism too and this exact thing happened to me, (SPOILER FOR CALL OF DUTY:INFINITE WARFARE) I saw a spoiler that Ethan, a robot from COD dies, I watched a video about his death and then I had a meltdown and stopped playing, it wasn't my biggest meltdown just a bit of crying and aggressive stimming but it was upsetting enough for me to flip out and stop gaming.

During that time of no gaming I just did other things like read and really not talk to anyone. If anyone brought up Ethan I would just cry. But to be fair no one really even cared for that game.

I was so upset cause Ethan was my favourite character, I didn't even get to see the end of the game I refuse to touch the storyline.

Though over time (it didn't even take too long for me to completely forget about the game) I stopped caring and crying over Ethan's death, though I still refuse to play the story mode, however I really don't know why I just have mixed feelings about it.

Its probably really hard for you to watch your son not really talk or enjoy gaming as much the best thing to do in this situation is to wait it out. 

Though I don't know how social your son is sitting on a bed and reading all alone is just a thing lots of autistic people and neuro-typical people do (personally I don't like watching tv or enjoying pieces of media with someone unless its games thats the only thing I'll do with someone).  


Feeling deeply upset over a video game character is very normal for autistic people, you don't need to worry one bit! However do keep an eye on your son, I know nothing about his behaviour or personality to make a final decision on if he's alright or not. I'm 85% sure he's fine but its best to keep an eye on his behaviour, if he's suddenly having more outbursts or meltdowns than usual or having them for seemingly no reason it's best to ask him if he's okay.

Also ending on that note just straight up ask if he's fine, find a game you guys can both play together to distract him if he's still upset.

&#x200B;

TL;DR He'll probably be fine and if you're not sure just ask him. If he's still upset distract him or spend time with him. Fixations and special interest might not always pass but sometimes autistic people get over it or find something else to do!  


Good luck, I think you're doing well as a dad."
