depression,feh2dbd,t1_feh1ouc,1579107698.0,"Thank you! I will look at it! I used to write down a lot too but I never shared it or have been honest with my friends. I don't contact them for months and use excuses, maybe I should just tell them what I feel and that I'm struggling but it's hard as you mentioned. Idk why but it always happens to me too, everything is going great and out of nowhere I get worse, Christmas was fine and then at New year's, I started avoiding everyone again, to this day.
I won't get better if I don't truly try.
I quit the game I liked too., I feel so bad about it.
I'm so happy for you that you had so much support, I might give it a try too."
depression,feh1mc8,t1_feh0zps,1579107254.0,"Thank you for being so encouraging, pets really do help! I have 4 dogs and 4 cats, I love them so much especially my cats ( I'm more of a cat person, my mom is usually with our dogs ).
I've been bullied at school too,it stopped as we grew older tho. I feel like school is a place you can escape from, it's much harder to escape from your future and work later on.
But I know that I'll have to try since dying isn't an option."
depression,feh12mp,t3_enrs4c,1579106919.0,"I feel the same! 
I even feel like a liar if I just think to myself!
Whenever I think of my mental health, the thought: ""You just want attention, everyone should pity you right?"" slips through my mind.
Although I don't even talk out loud or tell anyone so who should even pity me? And whenever I start to talk myself into pitying me, I immediately hate on me: ""Sinking into pitying yourself again?you're worthless, you don't deserve to cry or feel that way, other people have it so much harder than you""..then I think about rape victims, abusive households etc. and feel bad.
It really sucks."
EDAnonymous,fb33zk5,t1_fap9n4f,1576463724.0,"My mom always comments on how much I LOVE food shows and everything related to food and laughs about it.
At those times it hurts so much and I just want to tell her ""No I hate food for making me fat and I love food for helping me starve if I just look at it but can't touch it through the screen"".
She'll probably worry if I told her about it or laugh at me like she did when I had a panic attack...
I just feel miserable but I'm glad that I'm not alone."
