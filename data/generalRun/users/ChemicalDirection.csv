Your dog is an ANIMAL, who runs on instincts, and is incapable of having any beliefs at all, never mind thinking that dogs are better than any color of human. You cannot teach an ANIMAL how to act or react to a given stimulus without that given stimulus present! In this case, it's people of color! As a person of color myself, I have to agree with the other poc in this thread, you're fucking crazy, and how you're trying to treat us is really disturbing. Get over your own prejudices and do what it takes to help your dog be safe and happy around all people. If you have no friends who will help you, pay someone to. Find a trainer who happens to be not white!! This is absolutely your problem, and something you could fix very easily with time and some friends or some simple money, but your own biases means YOU aren't doing it. I think it's time you take a good hard look at yourself and your own behaviors. If your kneejerk reaction is being offended and ""omfg u don't know me, I love people of color/have lots of black friends!"" look even closer at your own behaviors.

Then if you're unwilling to help your dog learn how to be a happier dog, stop taking him anywhere he can run into a person of color, since all you're doing then is stressing your dog AND everyone else out."
dogs,ffupmpc,t1_fftj873,1580246892.0,"If you want him to stop, this is how you get it to happen. If you have no friends of color who can or would help, that's pretty much on you; put out an ad on craigslist asking for dog people who'd be willing to volunteer some time and pay them for their time. Your dog isn't racist, your dog is being a dog, reacting to things he is unfamiliar with and finds scary due to a lack of proper socializing when he was small. This is how you teach a reactive dog to not be reactive. If it were other dogs, children, cars, turkeys, old folks or literally anything else, the method would be the same: have someone you know and trust on the other side of the equation so they can't make the situation worse. You can't train a dog in a classroom via blackboard bulletpoints and long discussions about why racism is bad."
dogs,fft8jsd,t3_ev0oh2,1580212246.0,"He was not properly socialized when young with a lot of diverse skin colors, so he's alarmed and scared by what he's unfamiliar with. It's time to make meeting a person of color a GOOD thing, not a scary time when you scream at him and pin him on his back, which just reinforces his idea that POC are to be alerted and dealt with aggressively.

If you have some friends who are of color, ask for their assistance. It's going to take a long time, since all this time you've been teaching him POC are scary. Your first step is going to need to be figuring out where his threshold is. Is it 40 feet away? Go to 50. Is it 50? Go to 60. We want him aware a person is there but NOT reacting by lunging, barking, etc. Anything like calm at ALL, reward and praise with the tastiest treat you can get. And then over time work him a little closer. By over time I mean 'wait until he's reliably calm at this distance', THEN move a little closer. Reward calm! Reward anything OTHER than the behavior you are used to here. If he goes over threshold, back up until he's calm again and start it again. It could take MONTHS.

Eventually, over time, with rewarding and praising the behavior you DO want to see, you'll be able to get closer and closer, and eventually he will simply ignore them - or connect them to amazing things and thus think people are color are wonderful and get excited instead."

dogs,fft7smb,t3_ev3xjv,1580211336.0,"Throw all alpha shit out the window now. This dog isn't ""alpha"", this dog is AGGRESSIVE and intending enough harm to make your dog bleed.

Do you want to know what a real ""alpha"" type dog is? Calm, confident. They don't attack other dogs, they're not pushy and rude, they don't bully other dogs or demand they submit. They don't have to, they are secure in their situation. Dogs that do such things are untrained, unsocialized or outright hostile, and inevitably are insecure. Everyone who has an ""alpha"" dog that is acting rude, pushy or outright violent just has an insecure untrained unsocialized animal they're not bothering to control, stay away from them and their dog.

Including this one. The owner should be aware her senior is aggressive by now, why is she allowing meet and greets??? She's not even being pushy and demanding, she's just hostile, going right in for a bite.

Not every dog gets along. Some dogs are simply aggressive, some are same-sex aggressive, some are only very specific dog aggressive, and it has nothing to do with dominance. It's just how some dogs are. ""Submitting"" to an aggressive dog that wants to cause harm is going to ... cause harm. Possibly very serious, or even lethal harm. Stop subjecting your dog to one you know wants to bite her. No more chances, no more interactions."

Think of it kind of like as an extreme example, SOMEHOW your dog gets stuck in someone else's garage! And the only way you can get that dog out by yourself, is to break the door open. It's definitely destruction of property even if you're rescuing your dog, so it's best to call the police or try to contact the homeowner instead of just busting the door down. In the case of a trap, letting the local police/etc know your pet is trapped before you break/dismantle the trap is for similar reasons. I have never heard of anyone being told they can't immediately get their animal out, but in this day and age legal ass-covering can be super important.

She's telling you clearly that she's not keen on THIS PARTICULAR DOG, and you need to be mindful of that. They may never get along, full stop. It's POSSIBLE Dazie's body language is considered pushy or rude by dog standards, and she's accidentally setting Luna off.

That said you must never leave them alone unsupervised. Ever. The rescue you adopted from should have insisted on multiple meet and greets between your dogs before allowing the adoption. Do not punish Luna for telling Dazie to get out of her space, but make sure Dazie HAS space of her own where she can relax and this unwelcoming intruder can't get to her or bother her. Give Luna a couple weeks to calm down and adjust to her new situation, keeping them separated by baby gates and the like. This is called the ""two week shutdown"", google has a lot of info about it.

Then it's time to make being around the other dog (both on leashes..) the best thing that happens to them all day. Treats and praise out the nose if they're calm in the same room. Do not feed them together or treat them right next to each other, just.. in each other's vicinity will do. Take some towels and put them on their beds. After a week or so, swap the towels so they have each other's smells.

If Luna shows no signs at all of relenting and getting used to Dazie, then you must reconsider this adoption. Dazie should come first, and should not be terrorised in her own home. It's okay for a dog to growl and show they don't want another dog around.. but it also means the resident dog is the one that stays, and the combative stranger must go.

If Luna DOES stop growling and lunging, then continue to make being in the same area wonderful for them both. Pets, treats, praise. If Luna begins getting too stressed out, she must be put away. By stressed I mean staring, stiff body language, a high and slowly wagging tail, etc. Reward loose bodies, attention not on Dazie, and so on. Anything like relaxation, treat!

Huskies and heelers are both notoriously stubborn, and can be very sex selective in their willingness to have other dogs around. I don't feel this is hopeless, but be aware of the possibility that this adoption may fail through no fault of your own."

dogs,felo7sf,t3_eprliv,1579226895.0,"Maybe OP is trolling, maybe not. I'll give advice in case anyone DOES have this problem and goes searching. The one who bit might not be the aggressor, just the winner. Keep that in mind. You have no idea what instigated this scuffle, don't presume just because one dog has wounds, that dog must be the innocent one. Pits don't always grow up to like others of their own sex, or even other dogs period, even when raised together or related to each other. And sometimes the dog that starts things, isn't the dog that can finish what it started. (A good example of this is stereotypical chihuahuas snapping and snarling at bigger dogs. They absolutely won't win if they get into a fight.. but they're the aggressor even if they get hurt.)

That said, both dogs are still inhibiting their bites. If they wanted to do serious damage you'd have more than little cuts! This is a VERY good thing! Right now it sounds like they had what we'd call a yelling match, dogs make their points with snarls and snaps, but there is no serious injury, which tells me they didn't WANT to cause injury, it's ust something that can happen when teeth are flying around near each other's heads. Keep watch over them, and see if they keep getting into arguments. If they do, watch what they're arguing over! Is it a food dish? A treat? A special place like the couch or a new bed? Is play simply escalating too far?

If they're yelling over a favorite toy or treat, then they can't have that toy or treat when they're together. If play is just getting out of hand, teach them (by calling them away/separating them until they calm down) that they can't play too rough, but gentle play is a-ok. Don't punish the behavior you don't want to see - reward the behavior you DO want to see."
