When I first got the tear I used vagisil more often just to keep the area clean. But by using it I had that bad reaction. I never thought it was that but a comment on Reddit said it irritated them so I stopped and a week later it was healed. I had no idea what was wrong the entire time. I use antifungal creams, petroleum jelly, numbing creams, everything"
