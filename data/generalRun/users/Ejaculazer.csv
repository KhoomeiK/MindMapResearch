worldnews,fewgy81,t1_fesi96m,1579410409.0,"Oh I know enough people who've lived in here and there are definitely challenges as a foreigner in any monoculture. It's changing as the older generations pass on. The younger people I personally know are cool here. 

Back home there's a huge drug epidemic, especially in my neighborhood even though a 2 bedroom condo costs over a million dollars. We have a  huge lack of infrastructure and unless you're an outdoors person there isn't much to do.

I could go on about the positives and negatives about both countries but in the end I really just made a simple statement.

In the end Japan is an amazing country and there are many opportunities to live well here if you have something to contribute. Opening up immigration will be a good thing for the country as long as the culture of consideration and order are maintained."
