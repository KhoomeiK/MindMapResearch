worldnews,fcti6ci,t3_eipsoy,1577944101.0,We have in our top job as Prime Minister an acolyte of President Trump. Climate change for the PM is not real despite loss of life and property. Our climate in Australia is getting hotter and drier. This will simply continue as a consequence of global warming. The PM argues that we need not do more until China and India adhere to Kyoto protocols. So in the interim we sell coal worldwide which adds to the problem and every year this type of wildfire becomes the norm. Until one has seen fire (my family home was 30m away when the flames were finally extinguished) you have no idea of the intensity of the fire and heat and fear. Welcome to the Australian future
