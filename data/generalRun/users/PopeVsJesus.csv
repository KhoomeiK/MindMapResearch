Obviously we would need to eliminate every other subsidy to afford it but yeah.

Direct cash monthly would not only be better in terms of affording food, rent, etc, but would allow people to move for work, take less hours at work to attend schooling, etc.

It would also eliminate a ton of the administration costs of the government. I think like 25-30% of the federal budget goes solely to administration.

It’s a multi-faceted issue and i didn’t mean to imply it’s the only reason for the problems of today, but it’s certainly not helping.

The war on drugs has effected millions of people regardless of race but it has disproportionately affected the black community, of course.

I think something like 1/10 African-Americans have been arrested for drugs in their lifetime and i’m sure that has aided in the rise of single-parenthood but certainly wouldn’t explain 8/10 black children living with only one parent.

As far as education goes, all races are attending public schooling so I don’t think you can say that’s something that only African-Americans have to deal with. Not to mention that Affirmative Action puts blacks at an advantage over whites and asians who get penalized based solely on their race.

Besides, look at certain sub-groups of the black community. Nigerian-Americans are 3x more likely to have masters/doctorate degrees than any other race in America. A majority of whom are first generation immigrants coming from one of the most economically poor countries in the world."
ABoringDystopia,feoglsq,t1_feof6rl,1579299902.0,"The main argument against ***the current welfare system*** is that it may incentivize single-parenthood.

There are many countries that implement similar programs and have their single-parenthood rise.

That seems to be the number one factor when it comes to poverty. Being a single parent is difficult and expensive. You have half the income and half the time to further your life in terms of education and work.

I can’t remember the numbers exactly but off the top of my head:

Asian-Americans average income: $85,000, single-parenthood rate: 15-17%

White-Americans average income: $65,000,
Single- parenthood rate: 25%

Hispanic-Americans average income: $50,000
Single-parenthood rate: 40%

African-Americans average income: $35,000, single-parenthood rate: 75%

Look at the single-parenthood rate for african americans before and after welfare is implemented.

Pre-1960’s their single parenthood rate was around 25%, and ten years after welfare was introduced it had risen to 40% and by the 80’s/90’s had risen to as high as 80%

It’s actually a self-propelling issue. Children raised in poverty by single parents are something like 5 times more likely to end up in prison and 10 times more likely to end up in poverty as well.

Here is Obama talking about this issue:

https://youtu.be/eRJBkoq1DXs

Now, you can argue that single parenthood is the leading cause of poverty but welfare isn’t facilitating it but you would have to ignore other countries that have had similar results. And the correlation between the rising rate after welfare was implemented here in the states.

From all the evidence we have there is no reason to believe that welfare is doing anything to ***solve*** the problem and is more like a bandaid."
ABoringDystopia,feodadi,t1_fenmk6o,1579298588.0,"Some people think that the current welfare system has done nothing to lift people *out of poverty* and has actually made things worse.

Just look at the economic growth of African Americans from the 1850’s to the 1960’s and then on. They were advancing economically since the civil war at rates greater than the entire GDP. When the US government started the “war on poverty” that economic growth trend completely reversed.

I think it's funny that people are convinced the entire war was based on oil when literally 5% of our oil imports are from Iraq. 

However, the issue that came from that war is the ""war on terror"". Yes, we have terrorist organizations that are out to harm us and we need to stop them but declaring a war on something like ""terror"" is a slippery slope because it's perpetual. You can label anyone, any group as ""terrorists"" and use that to justify continual military operations. Kinda like the perpetual war between Eurasia, Oceania, and Eastasia in 1984.

There is also something to be said about false flags in conjunction with the war on terror. Who's to say that organizations like the CIA (who are notorious for these kinds of things) don't fund, arm, and train certain radical groups and have them stir things up to justify US intervention?
