medical,feztbzk,t1_fezsa75,1579461389.0,"Thanks. I get hot very easily, and usually have a fan on me. I also take advil for several conditions, so my fevers are controlled. So I don't think it's much of a problem. I'll be going out soon to get some cold medicine pills for multi-symptoms and some orange juice for the vitamin C."
roblox,fezh1s9,t1_fezebk6,1579457252.0,"It's against roblox's terms of service and Terms Of Use, and also breaks the law. [https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846-Roblox-Terms-of-Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846-Roblox-Terms-of-Use)

Not only will your account most likely get banned, you might end up facing legal penalties and/or jail time. It falls under Account Theft. It is against roblox rules to share, sell, or trade accounts.

I really shouldn't have to provide sources for you, as you can and should do your own research and actually read through the terms of use and terms of service.

As well as your roblox account you are trying to sell will also be reported, as has this subreddit post."
CasualConversation,fezf4rc,t3_eqzg8o,1579456688.0,"People at Aldi don't really acknowledge the cashiers. They're some of the friendliest people and get some of the best benefits. They get paid to \*sit down\* to ring things up. And most of the time they don't actually say anything to me either, which is what made me want to work there. I can ignore the customers all I want and occasionally say 'hi hello' and just be paid to ring things up. As someone with major anxiety, this works out both ways for me. I'll acknowledge them if they say something, but if not I usually ignore them as well."
roblox,feze30i,t3_eqzgif,1579456404.0,"Is.. This a joke? It's literally illegal to sell your account or roblox items/currency for real money or outside currencies. You could \*give\* your account to someone, but selling it for robux or any kind of currency, virtual or otherwise is illegal."

I've always drank ice water when I get sick and it's never seemed to bother me before. My throat feels a little better today, too! :)"
medical,few3ob3,t1_feuayrk,1579404895.0,"Thank you! I didn't know that about sugary things. I'll stick with my popsicles because they help a lot, and I've been drinking lots of ice water. 
I'll make some iced black tea tomorrow morning. Thank you~!"
medical,fetqnjk,t1_fesxhf3,1579378468.0,"I looked up tonsillitis and it looks like it's bacterial tonsillitis. I went out and bought popsicles, and soda to help my throat not hurt as bad. I have soup, def going to be eating that. I can't drink warm/hot things because it upsets my stomach, but hopefully the soup helps. (For some reason soup doesn't hurt my stomach, it's weird) 
Thank you very much, all the symptoms match to my case. 
Ear pain, sore throat, runny nose, congestion, impaired voice, pain when swallowing, white dots on my tonsil, fatigue, fever, poor appetite... Everything pretty much matches. Hopefully it'll go away on it's own and I won't have to see a doctor. It said it goes away within 10 days, I'm on day 3 or 4 now. So if it persists for 4-5 days longer I'll probably see a doctor.
Thank you!"
