loseit,ffd0y8a,t3_esol5i,1579811258.0,"Hey I've been there. I lost 140 pounds in college and never really lost the waist 'skirt.' But I've still gone through life... jobs, relationships, yeah I don't have the perfect body and maybe never will. I refuse to go under the knife for vanity. We will all grow old and sag, friend. You gotta get past comparing yourself to everyone else. ""Comparison is the thief of joy."" 

Ruined your life is a bit dramatic. Congratulations on the weight lifting - this will help fill in that skin some."
DotA2,ffcwpb5,t1_ffbdnx6,1579808848.0,"Same here 3800 game  crusader 1 support, which is all I play. You can ward/stack/pull all you want but you can't force others to play well."
DotA2,ff6gt6r,t1_ff6gkc4,1579626884.0,"Thank you. It's true, techies has an absurd stun, longest silence in the game, and can place mines for kiting people. If my team is smart enough to think of doing it. Suicide is good too... You can't kill him without lockdown or silence until you get late game. Just using suicide to visit fountain early is good."
DotA2,ff696pk,t3_ersiql,1579622072.0,"I play techies a lot in mid 1k and about half the games end in 30m or so. Not terribly unlike with other comps. I don't just mine the towers/base... even 1k people are buying tons of sentries now. I push aggressively with mines, go for early kills with BlastOff. Then secure the map for farmers."
DotA2,feej3bq,t1_feedx2p,1579034777.0,"Wasn't polite, doesn't seem legit"
DotA2,fee7479,t3_eoo14c,1579027768.0,Canadian so deduct about 1000 MMR... Americans are naturally better at wargames. Prove me wrong
DotA2,fecdb68,t1_fec6mze,1578971225.0,How can she slap me sir
DotA2,fec4ynp,t1_febgglx,1578966720.0,I mean. I just got out of a game where they were constantly counter warding and were very careful. I don't think 1k are the mouthbreathers people want to claim.
DotA2,feb3kuw,t1_feb243c,1578955115.0,Yeah Chicago
DotA2,feb0exw,t1_fea73o2,1578954176.0,Yes techies is only for high-IQ intellectuals so proceed with caution
DotA2,feaynbf,t3_eo9de8,1578953599.0,How did I miss this... lol
DotA2,fdokimr,t1_fdocwlp,1578606986.0,Most supports in 1.5-2k are warding. Maybe half of those de-ward. We're not all mouthbreathers...
MadeMeSmile,fdo7npj,t1_fdnvvhh,1578600312.0,I was confused too. Ace pet?
DotA2,fdlc5ae,t3_elypxi,1578520874.0,Lion max Mana drain lol. That'll... Shut him up.
DotA2,fdl0zt0,t1_fdkzqip,1578515149.0,"Right but there's a support MMR specifically which I think is highly variable. And even core - if you have to pick 'one man stomp' heroes for your 'true skill' to shine through, it's not a very valid stat. Kind of proved my point."
DotA2,fdkycg3,t1_fdky1r1,1578513684.0,Most heroes and positions can't 1v5 steamroll. If you can do that on Oracle I'll send you $5.
DotA2,fdezyav,t3_eksc92,1578350206.0,"I'm 1400 MMR with 3800 games played. Almost always support. I stack before pulling and rarely see people do that. I deward. I harass, hard. I rotate when the enemy overextends. I play a few heroes very well and stick to them but consider the enemy comp if possible. I give tangoes/ward to mid. Use my regen on the carry if needed. I recognize when my presence in a fight is a liability. I EVEN PLAY TECHIES WELL (if my team recognizes the value of map control and not just hurrdurr K/D/A)

Frankly what ends up happening like when I play Lion is I become a de facto carry. I blow up the enemy (usually a squishy carry that forgot to buy bkb). But when I can't do that I feel so helpless. ""Hey guys, let's push after a wipe!"" ""Don't dive into the ancient, just take rax!"" ""Don't chase blindly when their team is alive!"" 

But if I can't, sometimes I have to sit there helplessly and take abuse for not running blind into their jungle even if it's a bad idea. ""We couldn't see anything! Bad support!"" Then why take the fight? 

I know everyone says this but I'm considerably more experienced than the average 1400MMR (but not all, I've ran into some very decent players) and I have another account closer to 3k where I barely notice a difference. MMR is kind of arbitrary."
stopdrinking,fdeyvrm,t3_el18n5,1578349539.0,You and me both. High five!
stopdrinking,fdexxts,t1_fdeu3f3,1578348954.0,Congratulations! I agree the shift in mindset is incredibly helpful.
stopdrinking,fdead6k,t3_ekvmle,1578334684.0,Alcohol Explained is a good book and imo better than Naked Mind. It really gets at the root of why we do what we do. It was more enlightening to me than anything.
stopdrinking,fd0203r,t3_ejnov8,1578112466.0,"What's done is done, but being at such an early age your body very easily repairs itself. The only unknown is the dna damage that leads to cancer. Anything else you'd probably know if there's damage done and if not, probably totally normal."
stopdrinking,fd00rsw,t1_fcz7ykc,1578111911.0,Be careful with that stuff. It's not as safe as people claim. Safer than the opioid addiction people treat with it I guess.
stopdrinking,fd00hew,t3_ejo9mg,1578111775.0,"The bargaining has to end. You don't really just want one beer, do you? Not having control over the alcohol is not a moral failing. Your brain is primed to expect more and give you grief if you don't get it. It's just a neurochemical reaction. So stop it in its tracks and don't have the first one."
stopdrinking,fczzx8y,t3_ejojvc,1578111524.0,"Livers swell when they're attacked. Once booze stops it heals. The liver is one of the strongest healing organs, if not the strongest. It takes years and years of abuse to develop cirrhosis, and if you were in trouble, you'd know. There would be no mistake. Liver failure is a special hell. But it's good to get blood work done to see what's going on. Enzymes are high when actively being damaged and return to normal once the irritant ceases."
stopdrinking,fczz69u,t3_ejh68s,1578111155.0,"You have to work some kind of program. One does not simply quit drinking. Not usually, anyway. I resisted for a long time but picked up 30 day sobriety solution and it's given me a lot of insight as to why I pick up. And tools to help. AA is there too. Your doctor. Tell a friend. Seriously, planets do not knock themselves out of an orbit.

And you're in an orbit."
stopdrinking,fczyvax,t1_fczkx58,1578111000.0,Oh my god the birds. The dew. The morning light. I know exactly what you mean. It would screw with my clock so bad.
stopdrinking,fczynga,t3_ejol8p,1578110886.0,Yes a distracted mind is clumsy. Give yourself some space. Quitting drinking is something that deserves energy in and of itself. You're not going crazy. Just a little overwhelmed.
stopdrinking,fczyeni,t3_ejonji,1578110768.0,"You have to accept that every time you drink you are rolling the dice. This stuff doesn't get better. It gets much sadder. I spent my 20s in the bar scene when I could have been becoming a better man. I sold myself short. 

People your age might binge drink a lot but as you get to 30 you'll realize that you're the exception. Everyone else has a beer or two max, if at all. 

It's great you're recognizing this early. Your behavior is a bad, bad sign. Stopping drinking is the best bet. Ethanol is for cars."
stopdrinking,fczxcxz,t3_ejp79o,1578110245.0,"This really is the best community. No negativity or egoism, just support."
stopdrinking,fczx9nn,t3_ejpdcu,1578110201.0,Wow 5 weeks of not being hung over! That sounds pretty great. Go for another 5 weeks plus one day! Every day spent with a clear head is a good one.
stopdrinking,fczwl7b,t3_ejpxje,1578109855.0,"Me too. I wish more people read his book. He explains how and why some people can't have just one. No guilt, no church stuff, just logic."
stopdrinking,fczwcea,t3_ejq0rl,1578109734.0,"I've been there. I actually joined a cirrhosis support group because I was convinced I had it. I learned a lot about it. In particular, if your liver was really messed up, in a life threatening way, you'd know. There would be no mistake. Livers can withstand immense abuse and go back to normal in days to months depending. Even with some scarring you may never know because once alcohol stops damage does not progress.

Also, liver pain is rare and would be due to enlargement. This is not permanent. Only cirrhosis is, and it's not something you can feel."
stopdrinking,fczvo10,t3_ejqg2p,1578109397.0,What's done is done. Substance use is a mental illness and should be treated like any other illness. Sometimes they hurt people you don't mean to. And people change. Learn to love yourself first and then be there for these people.
stopdrinking,fczv9il,t3_ejqqlq,1578109202.0,I was so inspired by his video. Glad you are too .
stopdrinking,fczv1xa,t3_ejqui1,1578109099.0,"Do you have health insurance? If not, you can go to the ER without identification and explain you are afraid you're going to experience withdrawals which can be life threatening. Give a fake name and address.

Congratulations on taking the first step. Just don't put yourself in danger."
stopdrinking,fczmdx4,t3_ejdjc8,1578104386.0,"Valium and alcohol is how people die. Please never do that again.

Don't feel alone though. I've been thrown out of bars, hurt, in fights. You have to take action or you will go do it again. 

If you feel alone come check out the AA discord.

Just people with drinking problems chatting informally."
stopdrinking,fczlqiv,t3_ejjvhl,1578103984.0,"Same here. My drinking friends married off and I never really found a replacement. I would just get drunk and hang out at a bar.

Friday night is hard. Every bone in my body says party time but I would never party sober. I wouldn't enjoy clubs or being out late without booze. It says a lot doesn't it."
stopdrinking,fcyyx1i,t3_ejmcfi,1578090158.0,"You're very lucky to be discovering this as early as you are. It's something to know about yourself and it doesn't change. Some people are allergic to peanuts and can't eat any without dying. Do they sit and sigh when someone else eats peanut butter in front of them? Longing for the days they could eat peanuts? 

Being young and in a frat house you'll probably cave again. Just being realistic. It's hard not to feel invincible at 21. I spent many nights out and mornings sick as a dog on the floor and wonder why I did. Mostly FOMO I guess. I wish I'd done something more productive and learned to have fun without it. Or to connect with people. Whatever I was trying to do. 

I never drank until the last year of college. My friend and I used to think they were idiots and had fun nights watching movies, snacking, that sort of thing. I miss those days far more."
stopdrinking,fcuy2uv,t3_eiz4ed,1577990821.0,Don't get caught off guard. On day 4 these reasons will be powerful and resonant but down the road you'll start thinking things like 'ah it was no big deal' or 'things are different now.' Things are never different. Great job overcoming temptation today!
overcoming,fcuxry1,t3_eixyks,1577990654.0,"Well the good news is that you're very insightful and self-aware. I evolved with a melancholic, critical personality due to my upbringing and am only now (31) addressing it. Does your campus have therapy services? CBT techniques sound like a great solution. Again, it's a slow process, but will improve not only your relationships but wellbeing in general. Listen to some self hypnosis tracks on youtube, look up self help books or audiobooks. Repetition and perseverance are key. But even in the short term, you'll feel a little weight lifted off your shoulders. Give it a try."
overcoming,fcuuuxh,t1_fctnsvl,1577988997.0,"I think ""not okay"" is a bit harsh but it can be a long-term goal. You (OP) sound young. People are more and more independent these days, which seems healthy, but the stability of a good partnership can't be overlooked. It can be a growth experience for both people. I'm gay and many many gay men are afraid to commit and would rather sleep around. It's the easy way out but ultimately unfulfilling, especially when you're old enough not to be attractive in that way to most people.

Long story short it's not possible to be healthy with ""just yourself."" Social connection can come in many forms but it's necessary. The most intense and close relationships tend to be romantic. Solve for X, I guess."

depression,fc7387k,t3_egg1l7,1577496341.0,"The dream thing is called derealization. It's a stress response. You're not going crazy, your brain is overloaded and dulling the environment."
