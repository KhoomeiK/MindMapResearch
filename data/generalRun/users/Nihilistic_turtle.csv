iRacing,few8nt2,t1_few7k1u,1579406950.0,Yeah I'm pretty sure technology isn't here yet but we can dream
PowerWheelsMods,feouz0s,t3_eq5hm4,1579305984.0,Is that a servo controller? I would just use a step-down voltage regulator to 12v.
evilbuildings,fe8giuf,t1_fe5x2pj,1578925901.0,Thank you u/rapescenario
askphilosophy,fdo5ik6,t1_fdmwj6n,1578599255.0,The myth of Sisyphus isn't existentialism though. I'm actually only half way through the book at the moment but I believe the analogy of Don Juan does not line up with a existential view and is definitely more absurdist.
SeattleWA,fdj9hi7,t1_fdj7trz,1578462351.0,I want to join a union but I need to wait a while. Changing jobs right now would be really detrimental to my family.
SeattleWA,fdj2r4i,t1_fdhavzl,1578456925.0,Yup I work construction and barely make $40k a year and my family lives in low income housing in Everett.
iRacing,fdhxb0m,t1_fdhv5au,1578431844.0,Why are you hating on op and people are down voting his comment. He asked a simple question and the community should support that and not be a toxic racers/Redditor
PowerWheelsMods,fdfk4qz,t1_fdejkrc,1578363581.0,It's 18v but it fits perfectly in the bay. All you have to do is make new connectors for the wiring harness to connect to the battery[18v battery in atv](https://i.imgur.com/SWBkrlI.jpg)
Piracy,fdfbpfn,t3_el2o4c,1578357919.0,You son of a bitch I'm in
nihilism,fdfbefr,t1_fdf2mfp,1578357718.0,"I do agree with you. I also think pop culture misconstrued nihilism as something like a mental illness (at least in the USA) although I do believe that nihilism is depressing, as it is a rejection of all morals and value. 

Yeah the video definitely is not a nihilists video and definitely has strong undertones of existentialism but I felt like it helped answer op question. 

I commented on another post but haven't had anyone answer me yet but what exactly is optimistic nihilism? The closest I got is a more positive absurdist?"
nihilism,fdels4r,t1_fdelkcb,1578341724.0,I agree with that but that is more pessimism than nihilism.
nihilism,fdel2cj,t3_eks2v8,1578341297.0,"Most everyone on this subreddit has no idea what nihilism actually means and are just lazy people who's life didn't turn out the way they wanted so they bitch a lot and say it's all pointless. In saying all this I think this video will be very helpful for you. It doesn't talk about nihilism but it addresses your question head on and puts things in perspective.

nihilism,fdcc584,t1_fdc3hrw,1578271362.0,"Nihilism is about there being no meaning in life and there can never be any meaning. A rejection of all morals and values. 

Optimism is about trying to see any good in a situation. 

Optimism nihilism has absolutely nothing to do with society."
nihilism,fdbkzpc,t3_ekgu1q,1578258394.0,Can somebody tell me the difference between optimistic nihilism and existentialism? Existence precedes essence

Existentialism,fc1q2ct,t1_fc1fs8f,1577326125.0,"This is why this subreddit is pointless. It Should be called: ""Believe in whatever you want subreddit"". Yes some absurdist stuff crosses over to existentialism and vise versa but it's not the same and should not be confused to be the same. Literally no one post any real existential stuff. It's just full of bad memes and misinterpreted quotes."
Existentialism,fc1axbw,t3_effzbz,1577313316.0,Wrong subreddit. Albert Camus was an absurdist and made it a point to not be labeled an existentialist.
Existentialism,fbtjt11,t3_eed55n,1577081553.0,"Op, would you say that nobody here in this subreddit is living their authentic selves?"
