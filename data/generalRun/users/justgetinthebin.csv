relationship_advice,ffv3uvr,t3_ev66yp,1580255049.0,"LOL the fact that you think he can change after 16 YEARS of the same behavior is laughable. you’re fooling yourself. i’m sorry girl, but you are being dense. you can leave, or spend the rest of your life like this. make the choice. 

as far as him not knowing how to live on his own...WHY is that your concern? he is a 30 year old man, he knows how to take care of himself. he just doesn’t care. because he’s lazy and he has a maid/mealticket (you) to provide everything. he clearly is capable, considering those few months he stepped up when you threatened to leave. he’s 100% using you. 

you cannot magically change behavior that has been going on for nearly two decades. this is how he is. again, you can continue to be a doormat and deal with this the rest of your life. or maybe in 10 years you’ll finally come to your senses and you’ll have to start over at 40.

her (or anyone’s) sexual desires are not more important than your MENTAL WELLBEING. you need to learn this. she can be disappointed she didn’t get to try something, that’s fine. what is not fine is you possibly getting long lasting mental damage from engaging in sex acts that you are not ready for with a partner who doesn’t respect you when you say no. your girlfriend is also too emotionally immature for this type of sexual relationship because she doesn’t understand or care that her actions could scar you for life.

i dated a man somewhat like this. not this extreme, but towards the end he made me feel so unimportant then tried to act like it was all my fault and gaslight me about the things he did to me. it took me way too long to break it off, but i finally did. i’m now dating a man who is the total opposite. he truly cares and listens to me and does everything he can to let me know he appreciates me. once i learned how it feels to be treated right, i honestly cannot believe how much time i spent trying to fix my previous hopeless relationship.

i was shy and awkward in my first year due to being nervous and new to the public school system, but after that i opened up quickly and made a solid friend group. my high school experience was really positive and i actually enjoyed it much more so than homeschooling. i think the idea that homeschoolers are weak and incapable of handling themselves in a large social setting is a stereotype and not always correct. especially if you had a healthy homeschooled upbringing (as in, not sheltered. since many parents do choose to homeschool to isolate their kids on purpose)."

at 21 with no job experience and no college, you’re first job is more than likely not going to be something you enjoy. my first job was the exact opposite of what i wanted to do but i didn’t have many options fresh out of high school looking for my first job with flexible hours so i could also go to college. you could look for entry level openings on indeed. my suggestion for people who don’t enjoy dealing with the public too much but enjoy animals, look for positions as a cleaner as an animal shelter. often times they don’t require experience an arent super interactive with the public (unless it includes working as an adoptions counselor) and it’s a good starting point. 

i highly recommend working at least part time if you decide to go to school so you can have some sort of savings when you graduate. take a look on local college websites, explore degrees, and their job paths. if nothing sticks out you can start doing general education courses and figure out a major later on. don’t use college as a placeholder so you can feel like you are doing something without actually following through. this is why i recommend getting a job along with it so you are actually working towards financial independence if the college thing doesn’t work out."

OutOfTheLoop,feo2o7k,t1_fenup66,1579294263.0,"okay so there’s a huge controversy over this because apparently there’s a lot of conflicting, possible incorrect dates from the article in question that made people think she was 13 at the time this occurred. 

i might have a few details wrong because i’m going off of memory but basically, her husband (idk his name and i don’t think he’s worth looking up sorry) wrote a book and in it he explains why his relationship with his daughter is strained. he claims that she “betrayed him” by sleeping with some of his friends who, i am assuming, are his age (40s-50s). the article says the daughter in question is currently in her early 20s which would have made her 13 at the time the book was written. so obviously people read this and said what the actual fuck, your child was RAPED by your friends and you blame her for it and cut her out of your life? people were furious about this. 

kat’s husband starts getting backlash and so he clears things up by saying the article got her age wrong and that she was actually legally an adult when she slept with his friends (around 21 i think). and honestly as much as i can’t stand this dude, i think he’s telling the truth about this part because you’d have to be a special kind of psycho to be angry at your 13 year old daughter “having sex” with your adult male friends. however, i think it’s still incredibly weird that he felt betrayed and got angry enough to completely cut her off because she as an adult decided to sleep with his friends? i can understand being weirded out and uncomfortable but to end your relationship with your daughter because of that..and what kinda friends do you have that wanna sleep with their friends kid, regardless of whether or not they’re a legal adult? the dude is just weird, not to mention the nazi stuff."

Rateme,feeuwo6,t1_fee44d3,1579041740.0,"both. in my honest opinion, everyone looks better without foundation. it can look good in certain lighting/photos, but the rest of the time it makes you look super cakey and really emphasizes texture and wrinkles. try a tinted moisturizer or tinted sunscreen instead if you want to even out your skin tone. it would look much better, imo. also checkout r/skincareaddiction if you need skincare advice, natural clear/glowy skin always looks better than putting makeup over it. i like to use a little highlighter on my cheeks, tip of nose, and cupid’s bow but that’s the only face makeup i use. 

as for your eyes, you have big eyes and long lashes so you don’t really need any extra makeup there to emphasize them. i’d say a little mascara would probably be best! you have really nice lashes/eyes naturally. 

lips, maybe a tinted lip balm or just regular chapstick. 

for eyebrows, i would work on making them look a little more natural. if they are thick naturally (which i’m assuming they are based on you having thick lashes and hair) then you don’t even need to fill them in really. you can just tweeze to shape them. if you wanna fill them in though, an eyebrow pencil looks the most natural in my experience. 

you are very good looking so i think you just need to be more comfortable letting your natural face shine more!"

sex,fe5pos7,t1_fdpun48,1578872708.0,"the fact that you are trying to make her out to be “in the wrong” shows you aren’t quite getting it. i understand you’re relatively new at this and you’re anxious but if you aren’t even comfortable asking someone “hey, can you show me how you want me to touch you?” then you are not ready to have sex. at least not with that person. 

when you said you had anxiety about this, i’m sure she didn’t think that “anxiety” was just a cover up for “i’m just stick my fingers in and out and hope for the best.” performance anxiety is one thing, being clueless about the female body is a completely different thing and a huge turn off. honestly, good for that girl for putting her foot down about her sexual needs. so many women don’t do that. it’s refreshing to hear about a woman being firm about her needs. she did not make a mistake.

the fact that you are here asking this question is a good thing. you are at least trying to learn. however, it does not take a sex expert to know that the vast majority of women can’t orgasm from penetration alone and need clit stim. this is just general knowledge. if you are mature enough to have sex you should be mature enough to be able to ask her to show you how she’d like you to touch her. so start listening to what people are telling you, rather than try to pin this on her, and accept that you didn’t even try. you’ll be much better off if you accept that you had a mess up and work to improve for the next girl."

AbruptChaos,fdqakvk,t1_fdpx5ne,1578661253.0,baby sitter LOL. you guys realize adopted siblings exist right? it’s more than likely the girl is his adopted little sister. this is definitely more of an older brother prank than a baby sitter prank.
AskMen,fdn2dvq,t1_fdkro30,1578575225.0,"pro tip: if someone is obsessed/stalking you NEVER give in to something they ask. there were probably dozens of other people she could have asked for that wisdom tooth chaperone, there’s no way you were her only option. giving in to them makes them believe there’s a chance which will usually make their antics worse and more invasive."
sex,fdn1zym,t1_fdmzg0u,1578574870.0,"gross. you’d think someone who is child free would be less condescending and more understanding towards the fact that for many women who don’t want kids, the abortion process isn’t traumatic and actually a relief. it’s not always has painful and bloody as described in the OP either. the person you’re replying to is simply saying maybe not to use fear inducing language like “it’s horrible for almost everyone!” which further stigmatizes abortion. 

but i can’t say i would expect a decent attitude from a grown adult who still takes harry potter houses this seriously."
sex,fdn0t95,t3_elzjhd,1578573758.0,"i’ve never met someone who uses the cycle tracking method who didn’t end up getting pregnant. i wish people would stop promoting it. it’s not that difficult to use condoms if birth control isn’t an option for you. nah, it doesn’t feel as great but it feels better and cost less than having to get an abortion. 

this isn’t an attack on OP, but more of a warning to people (particularly younger people) reading this who might consider using this method just because it worked for you for so long. no matter how regular we think our bodies are, that can change in a split second and you can end up in a situation like this before you are ready. take care of yourselves."
askwomenadvice,fdltm81,t1_fdjyuvb,1578532200.0,actually her biggest mistake was smacking and spitting in her boyfriend’s face but aight.
askwomenadvice,fdlt82m,t1_fdl8ips,1578531934.0,"yeah well, OP is the one who did that. not her boyfriend. her bf was being harmless, she’s the one who made it a problem. the one who needed protection in this situation is the BF apparently."

askwomenadvice,fdlsweq,t1_fdl9mrm,1578531716.0,"well, you are the asshole. and it makes you more of an asshole to wait to talk about it on your terms when you’re the one who physically assaulted someone. your boyfriend deserves an apology and explanation immediately, not when you decide he deserves one. 

you sound incredibly immature."
askwomenadvice,fdlso59,t3_elqiw3,1578531561.0,"i can’t believe how lax all of the comments here are. you and your boyfriend were playfully wrestling, a thing that is apparently normal, then all of a sudden you decide to smack him and then spit in his face. you gave him a half-assed, annoyed apology (only because he asked for it, i might add) and then when he asked to talk about it you swore at him, shut him down, and stormed out of the house. 

i really don’t care what was going on in your head. your boyfriend would be totally justified in breaking up and never speaking to you again. 

if you can ask to speak in person, that’d be ideal. but if not, calling and leaving a voicemail would be next best. give him a genuine, heartfelt apology, acknowledge that what you did AND how you acted afterward was fucked up, tell him that it is not his fault at all, and that you are going to work on whatever made you act out this way so that it never happens again. then, leave him alone until he is ready to speak to you again. 

lots of people suggested taking a self defense class, which is great, but i think you should also talk to a professional about why you feel you need “anti-rape training” and why you decided playful rough-housing with your boyfriend was appropriate to use as that training."
AskRedditAfterDark,fdlpz3w,t1_fdkltvi,1578529719.0,"how do you gather that from what she said? just because she doesn’t like older couples? are you offended or what lol. 

she’s 26 so not even that much younger than you. “i’m unnecessarily offended by what this girl said, she must have daddy issues” you sound like the sensitive one here"
AskReddit,fdjv3xj,t1_fdjek41,1578488496.0,do you think there’d be consequences if you went ahead and got a job anyways? even a part time one? the more you can start saving now the better. it’s not always guaranteed that you’ll get a job right out of college. especially not one that pays enough to support yourself.
AskReddit,fdjusoy,t1_fdjehqo,1578488207.0,they might decide to accept it because they still live at home and would rather have a curfew than have to throw money away on rent. or maybe their parents pay for college so they put up with it rather than have to take out loans. it is definitely an abuse of power by the parents though.
TrueOffMyChest,fdiic7r,t1_fdha10n,1578443568.0,"panhandling is illegal where i live, many homeless people here will panhandle to get arrested on purpose so they have a place to sleep and food to eat in jail. 

stop protecting him OP. he doesn’t deserve you."
HumansBeingBros,fdihs0w,t1_fdi187y,1578443211.0,"why did this get downvoted for telling the truth lol

i wouldn’t put anything past most youtubers these days."
truerateme,fdi4emq,t3_elhwo1,1578435536.0,why would anyone be mad at somewhat attractive girls asking for a rate? this isn’t r/amiugly. you can be attractive and still want to know where you stand on the scale.
askwomenadvice,fdf27e5,t3_ekru5p,1578351623.0,"lol no. “as a woman” you are not meant to feel anything special towards children. there’s literally whole subreddit here dedicated to not wanting children and it’s majority women. so no, it’s definitely not just you."
childfree,fddh477,t1_fdcvmtz,1578312023.0,"the way you worded in the post it sounded like you made the  “rule” regardless of what your husband wanted. if you both talked and came to an agreement together, and he just needed a little extra push to put his foot down then that’s totally fine. but the language in the post sounds really controlling like you were preventing him from doing it even if it was his stuff that he bought with his own money and still enjoyed lending it out to friends. i’m not shocked people got the wrong idea."
childfree,fddgx6p,t1_fdd70bz,1578311777.0,"if the husband used his own money to pay for them, he has the right to do what he wants with them."
