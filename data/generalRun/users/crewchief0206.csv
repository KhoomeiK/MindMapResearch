ChoosingBeggars,ff3p1ru,t1_ff3nuxi,1579545785.0,"Right on. I didn’t know any of that. The TV was a great TV. Only reason I upgraded was because I wanted a 4K TV and they are cheap these days. Went with a LG this time and, knock on wood, haven’t had any issues with it so far."

ChoosingBeggars,feztvc2,t1_fezb4ii,1579461592.0,"Wife and I upgraded our 46 inch TV from 2009 last year to a 4K 55 inch. It had intermittent speaker problems, (meaning 90% of the time the speakers worked great but after being on for three hours or so the speakers would get a bad crackling sound. If you turned the TV off waited five minutes and turn it back on, the speakers worked again.) I tried so hard to give that TV away for free but holy shit the hassle was stupid! I eventually took it off Facebook Market Place, relisted it for $25 and it sold two hours later. Dude was an electrician so he said he could repair the speakers for cheap and it would be a good gift for his sisters kid. 

Just blew my mind how hard it was to GIVE the TV (and remote) away for free. One dude wanted me to drive two hours away to bring it to him."

AmItheAsshole,fegs9fg,t1_feed4uo,1579101351.0,"I disagree. What are you suppose to do here? Tell your kids they have to be quiet inside the house and outside the house? If it’s the middle of the day, you send your kid outside to be loud and play and wear off energy. Unless it’s like 0600 or 2100 then kids are allowed to be loud outside. It’s part of being outside. Do you complain when your neighbors are mowing their lawns or blowing leaves or weed waking with power tools? No, you don’t. It’s part of life. Kids are loud when they play, it’s life, you were the same way when you were a child."
AmItheAsshole,fegrhx7,t1_fegnwho,1579100835.0,"This right here. If people actually read lease agreements with landlords (which is what OP would be) they can kick you out for almost no reason, the only stipulation is they have to give you a certain amounts notice BUT that’s only if you actually live in the house. They can cancel before you move in and in some states don’t have to give you a notice at all. When I first moved across country five years ago I had a townhome all set up to rent, lease signed and everything about ten days before I was set to leave the landlord called me up and told me he was mailing my deposit back because he was going to rent the place to his brother instead. Took the lease to a lawyer because I thought it was super illegal but nope, turns out I just should have read every page because it was all perfectly legal."

AskReddit,febqm6x,t3_eo6l00,1578961624.0,"My high school banned teachers from issuing bathroom passes except for what they deemed “emergencies”. This was because a few kinds got caught either having sex in the bathroom during class hours or doing drugs in said bathrooms. They added on two minutes to passing period as a way to “give students extra time to use the bathrooms.” For me though, I had my second period class on the complete opposite side of the building from my third period class and seven minutes was barely enough time to navigate the crowded lunch room and hallways, get to my locker and get to class on time, I usually didn’t have time to use the bathroom unless the heavens spoke and I ran into zero foot traffic. 

This particular day I really had to pee but went straight to class since I figured my third period teacher would let me go since the male bathrooms were literally the next door down from her classroom (maybe 15 to 20 feet). She said no when I asked her. I tried to hold it but we had 90 minute classes and my balder was already pulsing when I got to class. I asked again and again and again and each time I was met with a stern “not going to happen Mr. Crewchief so stop asking!” Finally I made the threat of pissing in her trash can if she didn’t let me go. Of course she didn’t believe me and said “yeah, ok...” so I got up, got the small black waste bin by the door, took it the opposite corner of the room where no one was sitting and was fully prepared to drain the main vein in that trash can. The teacher freaked out and told me to get my ass to the office. I made a stop at the bathroom on the way. I got suspended for three days for threatening to expose myself to my classmates. (One of two times times I didn’t get in trouble at home for getting suspended.) 

Because of this I had started a movement in my school and during those three days so many kids threatened to pee in the trash cans (I heard if the teachers didn’t let them go to the bathrooms that the administration ended up getting rid of that rule within a week."

tifu,fe4ex8d,t3_enook9,1578858559.0,"Dude, your wife is seriously over reacting here. Granted, you should have pay attention to get a little more but for her to freak out over a comment like that; I don’t know man. It would a different story if you made that comment about her twin (if she had one) or her cousin or her friend, then it would be a little pervy, or very. But I’ve seen photos of my wife at 15, she doesn’t look much different now. There are differences, yes, but for the most part you look at any picture of her at 15 and tell it’s her right away. I also happened to know my wife at 15 and I thought she was hot then and I think she’s hot now. 

I don’t have advice on this one for you man but I honestly think your wife is over reacting here big time and for nothing. If she thinks you’re a perv then she needs to say and give examples outside of this one time as to why she feels this way so strongly."

Who was President for most of that time? Obama. Blame congress and the states for the lack of increase in minimum wages.

You only want a person to have social media so that you can creep on them and make sure they aren’t lying to you. Instead of actually talking to them and picking up on the “red flags” if they are there. A person will trip up on their own lies faster than you’ll find them out on social media. Take your head out of phone for a few hours and actually talk to a person and you’ll know if they are worth your time or not.

Quick example; April of this year I was in NY (Long Island) for my grandmothers funeral. I stepped outside to have a smoke and my cousin and his FF buddies were drinking at his truck. I walked over just to make conversation. They were telling my older brother about this guy in their house who, and I quote: “solid fire fighter, man and a pretty decent hockey player but he’s black so...” and my brother said “the fuck does that have to do with anything?” And my cousins friend  (a fire fighter) said “can we really trust him ya know?” I walked away pretty quickly. There are far more examples of the racism but that was the latest one. The frequency of the N word out of his mouth is astonishing.

My wife and I were together for seven years before we decided to have kids. I had just graduated school, started my current job with a really great company, got offered a full time position, and my wife asked me; how do you feel about having kids? I said I wanted some and she asked when should we try? This was my thought process; we aren’t getting any younger, I have a great job now and money won’t be as much as a worry for us, I don’t know if I’m ready but can anyone actually ever be ready to be responsible for a human life? I talked about it all with her after. I should mention that she has two miscarriages prior to this and that came up as well. In the end we decided to try and have kids and if she had a third miscarriage then we wouldn’t try anymore (didn’t want her to be in danger). 

My boys challenge me everyday. Every. Day. I get frustrated with them, I know she does as well but all the laughs and snuggles and funny moments FAR out weigh the frustrating moments. Some days I feel like I’m failing as a father, some days I feel like I’ve won. I talked to my dad about this, a man who raised six children and he said to me: “Son, I’m still figuring this shit out. When you or one of your siblings comes to me for advice, sometimes I don’t know what to do or say, sometimes I can’t say anything even though I want to. Fatherhood is always a challenge even your kids are grown and gone. You do the best you can, provide for your kids and let them bend your ear when they need to. That’s the best I can give you.” And I think that perfectly sums up fatherhood. Imo."
