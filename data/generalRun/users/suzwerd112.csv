It's very odd to me because he was a high ranking Air Force officer and very fastidious about hygiene as a younger man. Now, as we were saying before, he's like a 10-year-old. Anyway, thanks for the conversation, craftasaurus! Best wishes to you."
AskOldPeople,ffe667w,t1_ffe5xpe,1579837742.0,"Yes. Very true. I recently left my job and moved to a new city to live with my folks and be their caregiver. I want them to stay in their home as long as possible. It's tough tho. Like I said, I fought with him for an hour about basic hygiene. Good grief!!"
AskOldPeople,ffe5lpm,t1_ffe5c0v,1579837306.0,Hopefully. I was reading an article about Afib and its link to dementia. My mom has Afib and has dementia worse than my dad and they both present their symptoms differently. Best of luck to you handling your dad! Here's hoping for better meds in the future.
AskOldPeople,ffdvoxl,t1_ffdqam9,1579830087.0,It does for sure. Two parents with it. I'm pretty fucked.

todayilearned,ff6cm6h,t1_ff68laj,1579624272.0,Totally understand! I am in California. My former psych didn't take insurance. $300/hr. $800 for initial consult. Good God! I paid out of pocket and put myself in debt because of it. I moved to a new area and am looking for a new doc. Not having much luck.
todayilearned,ff6ccv6,t1_ff5wmoi,1579624108.0,That's the truth! I've struggled with that for a long time. I can't afford $100 for 50 minutes of crying to someone. I don't get help. It sucks.
todayilearned,ff5t0zr,t1_ff5pwi4,1579609141.0,"Just curious, are you in the US? Wherever you are, I wish you the best with getting treatment. I've been through the wringer myself.
