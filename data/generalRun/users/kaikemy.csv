Looked up the prices and assuming you're in America, these prices are exorbitant but expected. It's a struggle getting the medical attention you need without spending a small fortune. Good to hear you got insurance to cover it for a while.

A major life illness is draining for the patient and their loved ones. It's not just the struggle of being sick and dealing with the symptoms but also the emotional toll on the family strains relationships. Dealing with insurance, doctors, money etc adds another layer and not a pleasant one.
